(Chongqing) Cheng Zerun, Director of the Military Service Department of the Ministry of Military Administration, recently stated to reporters that the department's future policy directions can be divided into the following points:
Simplifying Procedures and Avoiding Complexity: In the past, handling military service involved complex procedures, making it complicated for both those handling military administration and those being conscripted. In the future, we will strive for simplicity, speed, and effectiveness.
Emphasizing Propaganda: China's original political foundation is not yet perfect, and education is underdeveloped, causing great obstacles to military administration. In the future, we will focus on propaganda. Every county magistrate must personally go down to the villages to carry out propaganda work, so that the people understand the meaning of military service, with the aim of smoothly promoting and enthusiastically responding to conscription.
Census and Compilation by County: In the past, the locations for conducting the census and compilation of draftees were inconsistent, causing various inconveniences and sufferings for the conscripts in terms of food, clothing, and shelter. Therefore, in the future, all censuses and compilations will be conducted at the county seat to avoid the suffering of the conscripts and provide various conveniences.
Revising Military Service Laws: We will strive to adapt to the environment and needs. In addition, eliminating malpractices and removing various obstacles are all essential plans. In the future, if personnel handling military service in various parts of the country engage in fraudulent activities, we will resolutely enforce the law to punish them.

Editorial

### Ten Thousand Refugees

Yesterday, we spoke of the current state of Shanghai, with its extreme dichotomy of prosperity and decline. What is prosperous? For almost all industrial and commercial sectors, last year was an unprecedentedly bountiful year. What is declining? The number of people exceeds the available jobs, and the number of unemployed is uncountable; prices are soaring, and the number of those whose income cannot cover their expenses is uncountable. And there are ten thousand refugees. Not only can they not cover their expenses, but they also have absolutely no income; not only are they unemployed, but they have also lost their homes, their shelters, their livelihoods, and even their parents, their children, their siblings, husbands or wives; if not for relying on relief, they would have no clothes, no food, no lodging, and even if they received clothes and food, they might not be warm or full. This is the reality of decline. Within a small area, prosperity and decline are as different as heaven and earth; what crime did they commit to become refugees, and why are we so fortunate not to be refugees? If we truly have no sense of kinship or community, can we remain indifferent?

Ten thousand is an enormous number. There are ten thousand rickshaws in Shanghai. Everywhere you look, you see rickshaws, let alone ten times that number. Fortunately, these ten thousand refugees have been accommodated to some extent, so they do not roam the streets; otherwise, we would see groups of refugees everywhere. Just imagine: everywhere, there are ten times more homeless, hungry, and cold men, women, and children than there are rickshaws. How can we bear to witness this with our own eyes, to be heartbroken, unable to sleep or eat in peace? Supposing we can endure anything, there are ten thousand people seeking a livelihood in this small area, seeking clothes when they have none, seeking food when they have none, seeking shelter when they have none, suffering from hunger and cold, exposed to wind and rain, and no one can help them. Who can control them? And there is no way to control them. Then, how can those of us who are fortunate not to be among them wear our clothes in peace, eat our food in peace, live in our tall buildings and mansions in peace, or travel in our luxurious carriages in peace? Wealthy merchants and businessmen will not be able to live in peace, and even small businesses like youtiao shops and dabing stalls will not be able to operate in peace. Just imagine, what kind of scene would this be?

It is precisely because they have been accommodated to some extent that the suffering of the refugees may not be truly felt by the average person. However, why must we see refugees, be close to refugees, in order to truly appreciate their suffering? Just think about your own material and spiritual life for one day, and then imagine what it would be like to be a refugee with absolutely nothing. I cannot believe that you would not be unable to sleep or eat in peace. Let me give a few examples: It is now the Lunar New Year. What is the taste of cakes, fruits, wine, and meat? What is the meaning of making offerings to the gods and ancestors? What is the joy of socializing with relatives and friends? What is the entertainment of gambling games? These are not things that everyone does, or that every family does, or that some people like or disdain to do; however, these tastes, meanings, joys, and entertainments are extremely common, extremely ordinary. Everyone knows and appreciates them, but refugees want to do them but cannot. The morning is the key to the day, and the spring is the key to the year. We are happily welcoming the new year. So, we are getting rid of the old and making new plans, we are striving to be ambitious, and we have all sorts of future aspirations. But refugees have no plan. To resist the war and build the nation, those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength. But refugees are filled with grief and indignation, but have no way to contribute. Who has no soul? If we are like this and refugees are like that, how can we not feel compassion?

Relieving refugees is not the responsibility of exceptional people; all those who are not refugees have an inescapable responsibility, rich and poor alike, each according to their abilities. We must know that the heart of compassion is innate and should not be sacrificed and buried by selfishness and self-interest. Mutual assistance is the foundation of survival. It extends from one's own flesh and blood to one's relatives and friends, and to society and the nation. Without mutual assistance, there will be decline and death. The more mutual assistance there is, the more prosperity there will be. This is not just a moral cause and effect, but also a necessary key to interests, success, and failure. Those who relieve refugees do so both out of compassion and charity, and out of mutual assistance based on the moral and consequential key of success and failure. Charity is a responsibility that arises from natural principles and human feelings, and mutual assistance is a responsibility that sustains human community. Moreover, this so-called responsibility is not difficult or impossible to fulfill. Have you not heard the appeals of relief organizations? A refugee needs only two yuan per month. Thus, if you contribute a thousand yuan, you can support five hundred people for a month; donating one yuan can provide food for one person for half a month; even one or two fen is a way to make a small contribution to a great cause. Then, who among those who are not refugees cannot fulfill their responsibility? Moreover, the refugees suffer from national disaster, and the blame does not lie with them. It is not a case of poverty and lowliness due to sin. Those who are fortunate enough not to be refugees, is it because of their merit and virtue? No, it is due to a combination of luck and circumstances that they have not fallen into distress. If the situation were reversed, we too would be in need of relief. Or, we may not belittle ourselves as having no merit or virtue, and say that only those with merit and virtue are spared from becoming refugees. Then you must know that doing your best to relieve refugees is the merit and virtue of the present.

### The Third Session of the National Political Council: Chairman Chiang's Closing Remarks

(Continued from yesterday) How can we fulfill our responsibility of establishing the foundation of democratic politics? Today, I, Zhongzheng, as a member of the Political Council, would like to encourage each of you to clarify what kind of true democratic politics we want to create in the Republic of China, and what methods and steps we must follow. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen, with his profound knowledge of both Chinese and Western learning, deeply understood the global trends and the domestic situation. Based on his forty years of revolutionary experience, he created the Three Principles of the People, aiming to lead the Chinese nation to prosperity, strength, and happiness. The Premier's ideal for democracy was to implement a more thorough and practical democratic politics than any other country in the world. In the Principle of Democracy, he criticized the theory of natural rights and advocated revolutionary democracy. Secondly, he wanted the people to fully enjoy the four direct rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum. This embodies the Premier's spirit of surpassing others, focusing on the highest and most distant goals. However, the Premier was not just an idealist, but also a revolutionary practitioner. The higher his ideals, the more practical his steps. The Premier believed that only when the people can practice revolutionary principles and fulfill their revolutionary obligations can they be granted preliminary civil rights. He also believed that the people must undergo training in exercising the four rights before they can fully utilize their civil rights. The democratic politics that the Premier wanted to create was without any hypocrisy or coercion. Our people have inherited the bad habits of generations of autocracy, and their intelligence and capabilities are exceptionally weak. The people are scattered and selfish, and there are many obstacles within the country. With such a background, achieving such an ideal naturally requires starting from hard work and approaching things closely, and it cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, the Premier defined the implementation steps for completing the revolutionary work as three periods: military government, tutelage government, and constitutional government. After the establishment of the National Government, following the Premier's teachings, it first sought to initiate tutelage government nationwide, hoping to actively promote the realization of constitutional government and quickly achieve the goal of revolutionary nation-building. Unfortunately, unification was not achieved, and obstacles arose again. For five or six years, a large portion of the country's manpower and financial resources were used for the work of the military government period. After a brief respite, the enemy invaded, deeper and deeper. In order to safeguard national sovereignty and the lives of the people, the government rose up to fight. After nineteen months of hard fighting, the loss of our country's territory and the suffering of the people cannot be measured in miles or numbers. Judging from the current situation, not only is the work of the tutelage government period interrupted and hindered, but the work that should have been done during the military government period must be done all over again. In other words, we must first eliminate the invaders' military force, eliminate the traitors and puppets, and destroy the counter-revolutionary forces that disrupt national security and the nation. Only after the mountains and rivers are restored and the country is cleared can we talk about tutelage government, and then prepare for constitutional government. Therefore, strictly speaking, we are still in the military government period. According to Article 6 of the Outline of National Reconstruction, the work during this period should be: "All systems are subject to the military government. The government, on the one hand, uses military force to remove domestic obstacles, and on the other hand, promotes doctrine to enlighten the hearts of the people throughout the country." However, as mentioned above, the current need of our country and people is to carry out the war of resistance and national construction simultaneously. We must concentrate public opinion, mobilize popular power, and actively prepare for the completion of post-war national construction. At the same time, during the war of resistance, the people's sense of responsibility towards the country and their understanding of the Three Principles of the People must also be improved. Therefore, even during the military government period of eliminating obstacles, tutelage government work must still be carried out simultaneously. In order to quickly complete the great cause of the revolution, we should not only actively promote tutelage government within the scope that does not hinder military government, but also hope that the progress of tutelage government can supplement military government. Therefore, we must understand that before the end of the war of resistance, "military affairs come first," and the fundamental work of military government must be the main focus, while actively carrying out tutelage government work. This understanding is essential, otherwise all work will lose its center of gravity. Because what we want to create is a thorough democratic politics, we must not neglect procedures and steps. At the same time, because our country has been accustomed to autocratic politics for thousands of years, and the people's psychological habits lack the cultivation and training to be involved in politics, there are obstacles ahead in implementing democratic politics, which must be eradicated. All foundations must be solidified, so we must go through revolutionary construction. The Premier, in addition to dividing the revolutionary process into three periods, also warned us painfully: "The revolution of 1911 overthrew the monarchical autocracy of more than four thousand years and the Manchu conquering class of more than two hundred and sixty years within a few months. Its destructive power cannot be said to be insignificant. However, to this day, the implementation of the Three Principles of the People is still far from having a starting point, because after the destruction, there has never been any construction according to a predetermined procedure." Because at that time, most people ignored certain natural procedures and talked extravagantly about democracy, resulting in laws since 1911 being equivalent to empty words, and disasters followed one after another, causing the country's laws to become tools for politicians and warlords to commit evil activities. Not only was democratic politics not realized, but it also created many obstacles and sins for democratic politics. Just like a famous saying of a revolutionary during the French Revolution, "Liberty, liberty, how many sins are committed in your name!" We must now correct this mistake, starting from scratch, and we must establish the entire freedom of our nation and people, so that the nation and people can obtain true freedom. Since the establishment of this Council, our colleagues have been able to sacrifice personal freedom and small-minded prejudices to lay the foundation for true democracy. This is truly the most gratifying thing since the founding of the Republic of China, especially during the war of resistance. I am confident that my colleagues will be able to follow the Premier's teachings even more in the future, advocating that compatriots all over the country work hard during the tutelage government period, advocating for responsible and vigorous action, and preventing the ills of irresponsibility and disregard for facts. We must let the general public know that democratic politics cannot be regarded as a state of lawlessness, no system, and no government. The public opinion on which democratic politics is based must be sound, collective, and able to represent the will of the majority. The freedom granted to the people by democratic politics must be freedom that does not harm public interests or violate national laws. Especially since our country is now in a period of severe foreign aggression, we must educate the people to respect the absolute nature of national laws and power. The government is the trustee of national power, the executor of laws, and the protector of all the people. In order to effectively protect the interests of all the people and the entire nation, those who destroy laws and discipline and destroy the system must be sanctioned according to law. Any sanctions based on law cannot be confused with oppression. No matter what democratic country it is, there are government systems and laws. The systems and laws under democratic politics are especially to be respected by the people, and the destruction by a few is not allowed. We must lay the foundation of democracy in the war of resistance, not only to make the people truly develop their abilities, but also to make the people understand the true meaning of democracy. We political councilors are the leaders of the people, and we must assume the responsibility of education, protect the interests of the country and the interests of all the people, and for acts that destroy national laws and systems and weaken the overall strength of the war of resistance under the pretext of freedom and democracy, we must unanimously exert the authority of fair public opinion and stop them. We must make it clear to the general public that we must implement military government for the war of resistance and tutelage government for nation-building. There can be no hypocrisy or obstacles in this. We must learn from past mistakes and earnestly follow the steps set by the Premier's teachings to lay a permanent and good foundation for true democratic politics. The Premier's lifelong struggle in politics was to realize the Three Principles of the People and return power to the people. However, people who have not been trained can never govern. The Premier encouraged us, the intellectuals and revolutionary comrades, to be the nannies of the masses, to fulfill the responsibilities of teachers and protectors in the position of public servants. This lesson is indeed the only way to succeed in nation-building.

There are two stories in Chinese history that can well illustrate the spirit of tutelage government. One is Yi Yin training Tai Jia, and the other is the Duke of Zhou training King Cheng. Tai Jia was still young when he ascended the throne. Yi Yin earnestly advised him, and later generations compiled it into the Yi Xun chapter. Tai Jia could not listen and indulged in unrighteousness. Yi Yin made him live in the Tong Palace, on the one hand, he managed the government affairs for him, and on the other hand, he tried hard to educate him, not avoiding hardship or resentment. The three chapters of Shang Shu Tai Jia repeated the instruction, how loyal and sincere. Later, Tai Jia repented, and he was fully prepared with the ability to be responsible for administration. Yi Yin returned the government to Tai Jia and retired himself. When he left, he also described the "Xian You Yi De" article on the essentials of governance to instruct Tai Jia. The Duke of Zhou, entrusted by King Wu, assisted King Cheng. At that time, King Cheng was still young. On the one hand, he prevented the rebellion of Wu Geng, and on the other hand, he endured the rumors of Guan Shu and Cai Shu. The Duke of Zhou's situation was extremely difficult, but he worked hard and bore humiliation, enduring countless hardships and pains, and became haggard. He was always single-minded in stabilizing the country and helping King Cheng to establish himself, never shying away from hardship or avoiding responsibility. The four chapters of the Ospreys in the Book of Songs describe the Duke of Zhou's loyal heart in painstakingly training King Cheng. After hundreds of generations, reading it still moves people. Looking at his original book: "Ospreys, ospreys, since you have taken my son, do not destroy my house. Be kind and diligent, and care for your chicks. Before the sky is overcast and rainy, remove that mulberry soil and build up the windows and doors. Now, these common people, who dare to insult me? I work hard with my hands, I gather the reeds and store the rent, and my mouth is sore from speaking, saying that I have no home. My feathers are tattered, my tail is bare, my house is dilapidated, and it is blown by wind and rain, and I cry softly." The last two paragraphs describe the Duke of Zhou's pain and fatigue to the extreme. Although he worked hard, the country was stable. Although his feathers were worn out, his home was still exposed to wind and rain. Inspired by the passion of responsibility, he entrusted it to an urgent lament. This is truly worthy of infinite sympathy and admiration from future generations. Later, the rebellion was put down, and King Cheng was also successfully trained by him. Like Yi Yin, he returned the government to King Cheng. He was still not at ease, and he described another lesson, "Wu Yi," to let King Cheng know that it was difficult for his predecessors to start a business, and they should be diligent and never be lazy. We were born in an unprecedented national crisis, when nation-building has not yet been completed. Reading the Ospreys poem, can we not feel the same as the Duke of Zhou? The Premier's comparison with Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou is our nation's only revolutionary mentor. He had the political revolution of the three periods of military government, tutelage government, and constitutional government. The country wanted to train the people to be mature first, and then return the government to the people. This spirit of dedication and responsibility shines through the ages, how great it is. Yi Yin said in "Xian You Yi De": "It is not that Heaven privately possesses me with Shang, but that Heaven blesses one virtue. It is not that Shang seeks from the common people, but that the people return to one virtue." After our Republic of China overthrew autocracy, there is also a common thing to follow, which is the Premier's Three Principles of the People. At present, the work of our colleagues is to be close to the Premier and to follow the ambitions of Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou, to truly implement the Three Principles of the People, so that compatriots all over the country sincerely "return to one virtue." To implement the Three Principles of the People and establish the positive foundation of democratic politics is that our colleagues in the Political Council must take on this arduous responsibility together. We are the leaders of the people of society, and we must first establish the model of the people, educating and leading the people with loyalty and sincerity, so that they know their responsibilities and understand how to take responsibility. We are Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou, and the masses are Tai Jia and King Cheng. We must regard the masses as the main body of the country, and we must teach them, train them, and finally return the government to them. When they are all established and democratic politics is realized, we must fulfill this mission. We must set an example within and outside the Council, respect laws and regulations, strictly abide by discipline, be loyal, and take responsibility. The ancients said, "If one is upright, one will be followed even without orders," and also said, "Those who teach by example are followed." If we want to be a model for the people, we must practice what we preach, take responsibility, and abide by discipline. When we make speeches, every word and sentence must be responsible to the country and the people. All our actions must abide by national discipline. With this spirit, we can set an example for the people, and the people will naturally accept it. The people we train can then implement true democratic politics. The purpose of the government in convening the Political Council is to have us share responsibility, be Yi Yin, and be the Duke of Zhou. The government hopes that when the military affairs are over, the work of tutelage government will have been completed at the same time. In other words, the day of victory in the war of resistance is the time when the foundation of nation-building is firmly established. The government has such expectations of us, and the people's expectations of us are very high. How should we work hard so that we can live up to them? Whether democratic politics can be established completely depends on us. Whether the nation can be revived is completely up to us. The ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People, the world of great harmony, that is, the outline recorded in the Book of Rites, must be promoted by us political councilors with one heart and unremittingly, so that the people are diligent and develop a spirit of mutual assistance. The Fifth Plenary Session hopes that the whole country will devote itself to strengthening unity, actively struggling, and accelerating the three points of construction. Many proposals from this meeting have made it more concrete, and we political councilors must also actively promote it and take the lead in implementing it, so that the social effect can be promoted and implemented. Our Political Council is not a deliberative body in ordinary times. We are a leading body for resisting aggression, sharing weal and woe, working together, and sharing security and danger. It is not only the expression of public opinion, but also the concentration of popular power. Our political councilors not only sit and talk, but also stand up and act. This spirit of not avoiding difficulties and dangers and not shying away from hard work has already earned great reputation. Now the second stage of the war of resistance has begun, and the success or failure is even more important. After this meeting, all of you will go to various places, and you must take advantage of the common will and resolutions of this session, contribute your sincerity, contribute your abilities, enhance our national spirit, and promote our inherent morality. For the several most important proposals of this conference, such as strengthening the conscription system, implementing spiritual mobilization, promoting economic construction, and rectifying the Baoxia in various places, I hope that all of you will take on the responsibility of advocating and promoting them, and work separately in the places where you are working, and implement them one by one. Not only can the government get a lot of help, but it is also beneficial to the country, the nation, and all compatriots. At the closing of this conference, I look forward to the arduous work in the future, and I am truly overwhelmed by my expectations for the compatriots in various places who are in the same boat through wind and rain. I wish you all work hard together to make the war of resistance victorious and the nation-building successful. (End) (Electric report on the 21st)

### Closing Remarks by Vice-Chairman Zhang and Political Council Member Zhang

(Chongqing) National Political Council Member Zhang gave a speech at the closing ceremony, the original words are as follows: The opening of the third session of the Political Council is fortunate to have our supreme leader who presides over the war of resistance to the end as the chairman. Colleagues of this Council regard it as the supreme honor. Especially in the difficult period, the soldiers at the front sacrificed their lives in blood, and compatriots all over the country suffered all kinds of trampling and destruction by the enemy. Colleagues of this Council are full of enthusiasm. Often hearing our chairman explain the national policy of the war of resistance will surely win is a good medicine for the people of the whole country. Cowardly psychology is swept away. Colleagues of this Council, after hearing about politics, have conducted long-term research and investigation, and felt that the important proposals in this meeting, such as the amendment to the Conscription Law, the financial and economic plan for the war zone, urging the Provincial and County City Political Council case, the rectification of the people's self-defense in the rear, the adjustment of the administrative organization case, and the development of the border culture case, etc., are more realistic and more concentrated than the previous two sessions. They carefully consider the plans proposed by the government and are not tired of reasonable dialectics, correcting the decadent trend of only A and perfunctory in our country's tradition. They take the war of resistance as higher than everything else and try their best to avoid friction between domestic factions, gradually developing a good atmosphere of solidarity and benefiting without being different, so that the great nation of 450 million people can unite sincerely to resist the brutal enemy's aggression and create world peace. Under the guidance of the supreme leader, colleagues and others secretly take it as their responsibility. Our country's culture of more than 4,000 years is recognized by various countries. Japan has inherited a part of the Tang style and has been baptized by Western civilization. Relying on its military force, it wants to conquer the world with the fallacy of Tokyo's near attack and using Chinese to control Chinese. Our country's war of resistance is not only related to the survival and extinction of our country, but also the axis of success or failure for world justice and humanity. They are violent, we are benevolent, they are fraudulent, we are righteous. The deeper they sink, the stronger our resistance. What they get is a point and a line, what we are fighting for is the area. Looking at the situation in the second phase, it has reached the goal of attrition warfare and protracted warfare. For the guerrilla areas, colleagues yearn for the government to unify power and responsibility, stabilize people's hearts, and supervise and verify the names and reality of the government, so as to live up to the government's grand intention of gathering ideas. In terms of the training and organization of national mobilization, pay close attention to making the Three Principles of the People popular throughout the country, and let men, women, old and young deeply root in people's hearts. Colleagues dare to use 12% of their sincerity and do their best as a member of the people, and will never change. They will surely win the war of resistance and build the country, so as to respond to the martyrs, the people, and the friendly countries who sympathize with and maintain us, and complete the responsibility of national participation in politics. Fang Wei is the day of revolutionary success. I hereby give a speech. (Electric report on the 22nd)

(Chongqing) The Vice-Chairman of the National Political Council, Zhang, gave a speech at the closing ceremony. The following is a supplementary record: Vice-Chairman Zhang said, today is the closing day of the third session of the National Political Council. Let me briefly talk about my personal feelings. When our first session of the National Political Council was convened, I personally did not have a very clear understanding of the National Political Council. I thought there were many difficulties. If the various parties and factions acted in their own way, it would be difficult to unite. After the meeting, I felt that there was hope and that it was not difficult to go to the national crisis together and be of one mind. When the second meeting was held, I felt that there was more progress. When this meeting was held, I felt that the mission we were responsible for in the first stage could be completed. This time, Chairman Chiang came to be the chairman. Seeing everyone's warm welcome to the chairman and seeing everyone's respect when the chairman spoke, everyone recognized the significance of this meeting. During this meeting, our proposals were also discussed very carefully by everyone, but at the same time, we know that everyone is not here just to discuss the proposals. I think we also have a second, more important mission. How do we complete the work of realizing democratic politics, and how do we reach this matter smoothly from tutelage to constitutional government? I learned that it was much more important than discussing the contents of a few proposals. This meeting went very smoothly. What was especially different from the previous two meetings was that the General Assembly had a clearer understanding of everyone's responsibilities than before, and everyone's spirits were particularly high. After listening to the chairman's several speeches, I understood the path forward. Everyone is very willing to follow the chairman to carry out our work and realize our expectations. I hope that we can continue to work hard in the future based on the current spirit, so as to lay the foundation of China's democratic political country and complete our second phase of the mission.

### The Chinese Army Firmly Defends Tongguan; The Japanese Army Repeatedly Attempts to Sneak Across Unsuccessfully, Cutting Off the Longhai Road is a Dream

Tongguan: Although the war between the Chinese and Japanese armies has been going on for almost a year, the Chinese army has twice recaptured Fenglingdu, but was finally reoccupied by the Japanese army. The front lines of both sides are less than two miles apart. The lives of the Chinese people are almost the same as before the war. An Associated Press reporter, led by the Chinese army, climbed the mountain to observe Fenglingdu, crawling on the ground, because Japanese snipers sometimes shot. There is very little military activity in Fenglingdu, because there are not many Japanese troops in the city, and they dare not go out, because Chinese snipers are very active, and the Chinese people had already withdrawn completely before the Japanese army occupied the city. The Associated Press reporter saw concrete machine gun positions all over the Yellow River bank, as well as communication trenches. According to the Chinese army, since February 7, 1938, the Japanese army has fired 40,000 shells at Tongguan, so Tongguan has become a ruin, with very few people. The Japanese army's attempt to cut off the Longhai Road has not succeeded. Tongguan originally had 50,000 residents, and now there are only 30,000. The central government recently allocated 40,000 yuan to relieve the poor, purchase salt and rice, and build caves to avoid air raids (Associated Press report on the 18th).

Tongguan: The Yellow River was originally a disaster for China, but now it has been regarded as a friend of China, because the muddy water of the Yellow River is the main factor in preventing the Japanese army from advancing to the northwest. Where the Yellow River folds to the north, the front lines of the Chinese and Japanese armies are less than two miles apart between Tongguan and Fenglingdu. Chinese military personnel told the Associated Press reporter that the Yellow River is a friend of the Chinese side, because the weather was warm in December last year and January this year, and the Japanese army concentrated its efforts to cross the river, but failed, and had to use bamboo rafts and rubber boats. The Japanese army attempted to cross the river at Yumen, 35 miles north of Tongguan, in January, and attempted to sneak across 3 miles east of Fenglingdu yesterday, but both failed. The Japanese army covered its infantry crossing the river with fierce artillery fire, but the Chinese army resisted with machine guns and artillery. It is expected that the Japanese army will attack in March and June, but the floods in July and August will prevent the Japanese army from crossing the river. The Associated Press reporter rode on a comfortable American-style train on the Longhai Road at night, and got off 20 miles from Tongguan. The train accelerated when it passed through the dangerous area. Japanese artillery constantly bombarded. The reporter planned to enter the nearby city at midnight, but the guards did not allow it, so he slept in the open air. In the morning, he walked along the road. The dust on the road was six inches deep, and when the wind rose, the flying dust blew on his face. Near Tongguan, the reporter had to take temporary shelter in the mountain paths for fear of Japanese artillery bombardment. The Chinese artillery is the latest type of foreign artillery, with a longer range and accurate aiming. It has destroyed ten Japanese artillery pieces and killed hundreds of Japanese artillerymen. Not long ago, the Japanese army crossed the river to the east of Yumen, but was eventually driven back by the Chinese army. The Japanese army died 400-500 people, and the Chinese army suffered roughly the same number of casualties. According to the Chinese army, "The Chinese army's defense of the Longhai Road is the strongest, and the Japanese army cannot encircle Tongguan from the south of the Longhai Road, because the area is mountainous." If the Japanese army succeeds in crossing the river, the Chinese trenches and other defenses along the mountain will also be enough to resist the Japanese army's advance. There are 2,000 Japanese troops and 20 Japanese artillery pieces between Fenglingdu and Puzhou, and 4,000 Japanese troops along the Tongpu Road. The Chinese army has sufficient strength and is mostly composed of experienced soldiers. The Chinese guerrilla forces north of the Yellow River are not allowed to cross south to disrupt the Japanese army's rear. If the Japanese army wants to cross the river, it must greatly increase its troops. (Associated Press report on the 17th)

### The Sino-American Cultural Association Established in Chongqing

(Chongqing) The Sino-American Cultural Association held its inaugural meeting in Chongqing at 5 pm on the 22nd, and elected Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek and Henry Stimson as honorary presidents, H.H. Kung as president, Chen Lifu, Chen Guangfu, John Leighton Stuart and Advisor Yang as vice presidents, and Shou Jingwei as secretary-general. (Electric report on the 22nd)

### US and UK Echo Each Other, Actively Enhancing National Defense: US House of Representatives Discusses Expanding Military Ports, UK Expansion of Armaments Has Significant Impact

(Washington) The House of Representatives began discussing the bill to add naval and air bases today. Although the atmosphere in the chamber was tense, those in the congressional lounge generally believe that the bill will pass with a large majority. At the opening of the session, Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vinson (Democrat) delivered a lengthy speech defending the bill, stating, "Today, dictators are brutal and unreasonable. The United States has no other option but to add naval and air bases. Only in this way can dictators be warned. Moreover, the United States must strengthen its general defense capabilities to be prepared for any eventuality." Thereupon, Republican Congressman Fish stood up to question, saying that Guam's terrain is strategically important. Once naval and air bases are established there, it will be like holding a dagger to Japan's throat, which will inevitably provoke a strong reaction from the Japanese side. The international situation is already precarious, with rumors rife and everyone on edge. Establishing defenses on Guam might even trigger a war. Should we not be cautious? Vinson immediately replied that the United States does not intend to establish defenses on Guam, but only plans to set up an air base there to protect its transportation lines to the Netherlands East Indies, ensuring that the United States' sources of raw materials are not interrupted. The establishment of an air base on Guam is of vital importance to the defense of the American coast. Any Asian power hoping to target American Hawaii and the American mainland will have to take this into consideration and will not dare to act rashly. At this point, another Congressman raised a question regarding the UK and France invading the US to purchase military aircraft. Vinson further replied that supplying military aircraft to the UK and France, two major democracies, is in fact safeguarding the interests of our country. If the UK and France are destroyed, the United States will inevitably be isolated. According to the bill to expand naval and air bases, it stipulates that the government is authorized to use $52,000,000 to build twelve naval and air bases, and another large sum of $1,800,000 is allocated for aeronautical research. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

(London) The House of Commons continued its debate on the defense budget this afternoon. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately delivered a speech, stating, "The defense budget for the next fiscal year amounts to a total of £580,000,000, which is comparable to the total national debt of our country at the outbreak of the European War. This is of great significance. I wonder if the gentlemen of the House of Commons are aware of this. Although our expansion of armaments is on a large scale, it is only for defensive purposes. We have no intention of aggression." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

### Chamberlain's Declaration: Striving to Save the European Situation, The Time for a Disarmament Conference is Not Yet Ripe, Starting with Restoring Trust

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons today at the beginning of the second day of the defense debate had two main points: first, the large-scale arms race among the world's countries is mostly the result of mutual misunderstanding, and second, the opposition party should not nitpick or create inappropriate suspicions, lest the misunderstanding be exacerbated. When he listened to the defense debate yesterday, he felt that there was no previous agitation, argument, or anxiety. The general impression he gained was that the entire House was oppressed by the facts and, in light of the truth of the situation, had to agree on the current armament expansion plan and the methods for implementing this plan, such as raising funds. He recalled that last year the Labour Party had repeatedly stated the need for collective security and the basic policies of the League of Nations, but in today's environment, it has understood the futility of resorting to the League of Nations and has had to adopt other methods to maintain general peace and national security.

The Prime Minister continued, saying that civil defense is slightly behind the three major defenses of the navy, army, and air force. He said that the organization led by Minister Anderson is currently adopting necessary plans, which will soon be announced. The UK's air defense plan has already yielded results.

The Prime Minister also praised the talent of Lord Chatfield, the Minister for Coordination of Defense, saying that his experience is sufficient to fulfill his duties pleasantly. However, he must attend the House of Lords, so Morrison was specifically appointed as his representative in the House of Commons to answer questions about defense coordination in the House of Commons, but not as the Minister of Munitions. Recently, the production of armaments has increased greatly, which can ensure that the Air Ministry has enough aircraft and other supplies. From this, it can be seen that the government's decision not to establish a Ministry of Munitions is appropriate.

The Prime Minister then spoke of the financial situation, saying that he did not know if the House of Commons had recognized the full significance of the defense expenditure proposed by the government. The total amount is £580 million for the last two years of the five-year plan. If it is necessary to increase public debt in the last two years, then the Chancellor of the Exchequer may wish to ask the House of Commons again. This statement may not be wrong. That is to say, we will still need to raise debts after the five-year period, but what he is concerned about is not only this. Once the defense plan is completed, it will be necessary to raise regular maintenance fees. How much will the future maintenance fees be? We cannot make an arbitrary judgment now, but if the House of Commons recalls what Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon said, the amount that can be obtained from taxes next year is £230 million, then we cannot but doubt that the annual cost of maintaining this armament, plus the interest on the debt repayment fund, will not exceed tax revenue. This is a serious point, and we cannot take it lightly.

He does not want to make any suggestions on how to solve this problem now, but if we allow the situation to develop and do not think about trying to stop it, then it would be a sin. Someone spoke yesterday, thinking that the time has come to convene a disarmament conference of various countries. If he could believe that convening such a conference at this time could be effective, (someone in the hall shouted "Why not try it?"), he would have convened it without hesitation. (Applause from the audience). The world has not yet established sufficient trust. Convening such a meeting at this time would be practically ineffective, but if we ourselves show a little trust and do not easily believe rumors of other countries' aggressive intentions, then it may not be without benefit. He is sometimes criticized for not criticizing political enemies for fomenting war. In fact, he did not say that his political enemies wanted to start a war, but he believes that the policies currently adopted by his political enemies seem to be policies that could lead to war. Although our country's armaments are on a large scale, they are only for defensive purposes. If other countries are indeed like the UK and have no intention of aggression, then the only conclusion we can come to is that we are all competing to destroy the national vitality under misunderstanding. This statement is almost the truth. We really cannot relax our efforts to expand armaments until we have obtained general agreement from other countries to reduce armaments, but we should pay attention to possible opportunities and use them to persuade other governments to follow the path that the UK is currently taking and end the situation that will inevitably lead all European countries to ruin. This is also our responsibility. (Members cheered). (Reuters dispatch, 21st) Members of various parties spoke one after another, and all avoided criticizing the armament expansion plan. Some even advocated expanding the scope. Although some members said that the current diplomatic policy was not entirely appropriate, they unanimously expressed their approval of Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement on the shared relationship between the UK and France. Conservative Party member Churchill, Liberal Party member Mander, and others requested the government to issue a statement saying that when war breaks out in continental Europe, the UK should dispatch an expeditionary force to that place.

Opposition Labour Party member Attlee said of the collective security system, "Prime Minister Chamberlain has now reversed cause and effect. The armament expansion plan is not proof of the victory of the Prime Minister's policies, but proof of failure." The Labour Party's request to reduce the number of public debts from £800,000,000 to £799,000,000 is to show that the defense budget is clear proof that the Prime Minister's policies have failed. Regarding the shared relationship between the UK and France, the Prime Minister recently issued a statement saying that if France is attacked, no matter where the attack comes from, the UK will definitely help France. We absolutely agree with this, because the security of the UK and France are closely related. It is regrettable that the UK has become almost completely isolated after implementing the collective security system, with only France as its only reliable ally. I wonder if the government has ever had talks with the Soviet Union so that the world situation can become stable. If war breaks out in Europe, I wonder what efforts the UK is prepared to make in terms of the army. For now, the government should immediately establish a Ministry of Defense to handle matters exclusively. The government has also sacrificed the most important principles in spirit. People generally feel that Prime Minister Chamberlain is leaning towards aggression and dictatorship. Please the government lean towards freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.

Conservative extremist Churchill expressed his approval of the armament expansion plan, saying, "I have no objection to raising the amount of public debt to be issued. It is particularly regrettable that this method was not done earlier. The proposal to establish a Ministry of Munitions should also be implemented as soon as possible. All things that can make aggressive countries fear, most of the public opinion in the UK and the US agree with. The defense expenditure we are discussing today, as well as the accidents that occur daily in the US, and the accidents that occur in France and Eastern Europe, can all make aggressive countries fear. Regarding the shared relationship between the UK and France, Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent statement is satisfactory. At a time when the pressure of aggressive countries is increasing, this is the main barrier to preventing violence. The army general staff of the UK and France must now maintain close contact. When war breaks out in the future, what kind of assistance the UK can provide must be clearly defined, and it must be comprehensive."

Liberal Party member Mander said that the government issued a statement on September 26th of last year, saying that it would assist France and the Soviet Union in resisting aggression. Now, it should repeat the statement. The Ministry of Munitions should also be established as soon as possible. When war breaks out in Europe in the future, troops should also be sent to the mainland. As for the compulsory military service system, the people will definitely accept it when necessary. Conservative Party member Amery requested the government to issue a statement saying that as soon as war breaks out in Europe, troops should be sent to France. Although Prime Minister Chamberlain has offered a promise to assist France, this promise is worthless if the general staff of the UK and France do not agree on a cooperation plan. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Conservative Party member Churchill described the current era as an era of bloodless warfare. Everyone hopes and prays that this kind of warfare will never be bloody, and that true peace can finally appear. Conservative Party Rear Admiral Sueter said that the UK needs airships and more tanks. The government underestimates submarines. Germany is now building the same number of submarines as the UK. This point should be noted. The 200 small airships built during the European War were used to resist submarines and were very effective. Please the government set up more training ships and build more airships for wartime needs. It is heard that the UK only has 600 tanks, while France has 4,500, and Italy has as many as 11,000. If the UK needs to send troops overseas in the future, it will need more tanks. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### Siam Expresses Goodwill to the UK

(London) The Manchester Guardian's Singapore dispatch stated that the Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of the Straits Settlements, Thomas, recently toured Siam. People in Bangkok gave him a warm welcome. Anyone who has been to Bangkok has commented on this matter, recognizing it as a pleasant sign of Anglo-Siamese friendship. In recent years, Japan has been trying hard to establish relations with Siam. No fewer than six goodwill missions have departed from Japan to Bangkok, and it is rumored that Japan intends to build a canal through the Kra Isthmus. According to engineers, this is technically impossible. In any case, the cost is definitely beyond Japan's financial capacity. Siam's diplomatic policy is aimed at maintaining a balance between the UK, France, and Japan. Thomas's formal tour of Bangkok is very valuable because it shows the Siamese that the UK recognizes Siamese friendship as extremely important. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### UK and French General Staffs Will Conduct Negotiations Soon, Paris Newspapers Express Satisfaction and Welcome the UK Prime Minister's Remarks

(Paris) The newspapers here are satisfied with Morrison's statement in the House of Commons on behalf of the Minister for Coordination of Defense that the UK and French general staffs will conduct talks soon. Several newspapers also advocate that the UK should have a stronger army so that when war breaks out, it can send elite troops to support France. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

(Rome) The political circles in Rome were very pleased to hear the remarks made by UK Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday, and the Italian newspapers were very satisfied that the UK Prime Minister acknowledged that the League of Nations had become a dead object. They also agreed with the UK Prime Minister's preparations for discussing disarmament and his warning not to listen to rumors of other countries' aggressive intentions. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

(London) The Daily Express published a message this morning, saying that Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to propose a peaceful solution to the issues related to Italy's demands for French Tunisia, Gibraltar, and the Suez Canal. It also said that the recent negotiations between the UK authorities and the Spanish National Military Government on the recognition issue are related to this matter. The diplomatic circles here have denied this news, saying that the UK and Italian governments have never exchanged views on Italy's demands. The talks between the UK Ambassador to Italy, Lord Perth, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano recently were limited to discussing the issue of increasing troops in Italy's Libyan territory in North Africa. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

(London) Undersecretary of State Butler declared in the House of Commons today that, according to the UK government's knowledge, the official number of troops stationed in Italian East Africa is 69,654. The exact number has naturally changed from time to time, but it seems to have increased in the past few months. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### China's Overseas Cash Totals $400 Million

(New York) The "Far East Magazine," edited by the Pacific International Institute, recently published a statement saying that since the US government implemented the silver purchase policy and signed the Silver Agreement with the Chinese government, the amount of cash that the Chinese government continues to store abroad for war expenses has been a matter of general concern, but officials have never announced it. It is now known that the amount that can be mobilized at any time is approximately $400,000,000, which is more than what Japan has stored. According to the report made by Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, before the outbreak of war between China and Japan in 1937, China exported silver worth approximately $250,000,000. Last year, it exported approximately $160,000,000. The sum of the two is equal to $400,000,000. (Havas air dispatch)

(Washington) According to statistics released by the Department of Commerce, Japan purchased goods from the US in 1938 worth a total of $239,575,000, of which aircraft accounted for $11,000,000, gasoline accounted for $50,000,000, steel accounted for $22,000,000, steel products accounted for $9,000,000, cotton accounted for $52,000,000, copper accounted for $22,000,000, automobiles accounted for $17,000,000, machinery accounted for $23,000,000, and other miscellaneous goods were worth approximately $33,000,000. According to this figure, this accounts for only 14% of the total amount. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

### UK Economic Director Meets with German Authorities, Visiting Goering Tomorrow

(Berlin) Walterkin, the Economic Director of the UK Foreign Office, has been in Berlin for several days to hold talks with important figures in German economic and industrial circles. Goering, the dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan and Minister of Aviation, is scheduled to receive him on the 24th of this month. At the same time, Economic Minister Funk will also schedule a meeting with him. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

(Berlin) After arriving here, Walterkin, the Economic Director of the UK Foreign Office, held talks with most of the important figures in German economic and industrial circles today to prepare for future Anglo-German commercial negotiations. According to British sources, these talks are of an informal nature. Director Walterkin must return to his country on the 25th of this month. (Joint Havas dispatch, 21st)

(Berlin) UK Foreign Office Economic Director Walterkin visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday and held a long talk with German Foreign Ministry Economic Director Weier in the afternoon. Both talks were to prepare for the Anglo-German economic negotiations that will begin on March 15th. At that time, UK Secretary of Commerce Stanley and Secretary for Overseas Trade Hudson will jointly arrive in Germany. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

(Berlin) An authoritative source here has denied reports in London newspapers that German Economic Minister Funk will visit London in the spring. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

(Berlin) Today's Foreign Affairs News published an article, sternly refuting any suggestion that the UK wants to give Germany economic assistance in order to use the spirit of the Munich Agreement to open up a path for glorious coexistence between the two countries. The true motive for the UK's willingness to negotiate with Germany is not tolerance, but for its own benefit. The Hamburg Daily News expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that UK Secretary for Overseas Trade Henderson will go to Moscow after visiting Berlin. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### UK and Russian Old Debts May Be Resolved

(London) Since the Russian Revolution, the Soviet Union has not agreed to repay the UK debts owed during the Tsarist era. The UK Conservative Party has often used this as an excuse to oppose adjusting political relations with the Soviet Union and increasing trade volume. However, according to well-informed sources here, the main task of Secretary for Overseas Trade Hudson's trip to Moscow next month is to urge the Soviet government to resolve this debt issue and to issue a "symbolic payment" to prevent certain individuals in the Conservative Party from using this as a talking point again. At the same time, Hudson should also take the opportunity to make efforts to promote friendly relations. Since the UK Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, has been talking with the authorities of the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee recently, he feels that the Soviet authorities are dissatisfied with the Munich Agreement, so they have at least temporarily abandoned the policy of cooperating with various democratic countries in Western Europe. People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of that country, Litvinov, even said, "The Soviet Union can no longer trust the various democratic countries." However, the general impression here is that the Soviet government will not adopt a stubbornly isolationist policy in international affairs. Therefore, Ambassador Seeds has been actively working in Moscow for some time, trying to explain to the Soviet authorities that the UK's attitude is an excessive measure. One day, the UK will be able to make efforts to maintain peace with a positive attitude. Observing Ambassador Seeds' activities, it can be seen that the UK government intends to rely on the Soviet Union as a factor in the near future to deal with certain countries. Once the UK's armament expansion plan has achieved preliminary success, Prime Minister Chamberlain may no longer use the moderate wording of his speech in the House of Commons yesterday. This can be asserted. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### Ciano Going to Poland Tonight, Discussing Central European Issues

(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to go directly to Warsaw tomorrow night to visit the Polish government authorities for a three-day stay in order to hold talks with the country's Foreign Minister, Colonel Beck, and then go hunting in the Białowieża Forest. Well-informed sources here attach great importance to the Foreign Minister's trip, saying that the Foreign Minister will consult with the Polish authorities on the Central European situation, including the situation in Hungary and Yugoslavia. In addition, what Poland's attitude will be if conflicts occur between France and Italy, and what Poland's wishes are regarding the colonial issue, Foreign Minister Ciano will take the opportunity to ask the Polish authorities. Also, it was originally rumored that Foreign Minister Ciano would go to Berlin during his visit to Poland, but it is generally believed that the Foreign Minister will not go to Germany at this time. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### US Continues to Cooperate with the League of Nations in Non-Political Aspects, Promoting Human Happiness and Establishing International Order

(Washington) According to news here today, the US has accepted the invitation to participate in various technical and non-political activities of the League of Nations as a non-member. The Department of State has issued a document accepting this invitation, stating that the US believes that this steady step to promote human happiness is directly related to the establishment of an international order that the US believes is necessary for true peace. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly passed a resolution last September, instructing the Secretariat to notify the governments of non-member countries, saying, "All suggestions or opinions related to countries wishing to expand the scope of cooperation with the League of Nations in technical rather than political matters are welcomed by the member states of the League of Nations." After League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol notified the non-member countries according to this resolution, the first reply was received today, which was sent by US Secretary of State Hull. Its main point is that the US government has been working closely with the League of Nations on various technical issues, including disarmament issues, since 1924. In the future, it should continue to follow this path and make efforts to expand the scope of technical rather than political cooperation between the US and the League of Nations. This reply is quite in line with the US's traditional policy and has caused a good impression. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### Air Defense Exercises to Be Held in Berlin, Testing Air Defense Balloons

(Berlin) A large-scale air defense exercise will be held here in the near future, and two types of barrier balloons, circular and elliptical, will be used to protect the capital's airspace. This is an innovation in the history of German air defense. According to evening newspapers, this new air defense tool was tested once over the Leuna chemical factory in Halle last September, reaching a height of several thousand meters (the average height of German clouds has been below 3,000 meters in the past ten months), and its air defense effectiveness exceeds anti-aircraft guns. The cost of each balloon is also only one-third of that of a small-caliber anti-aircraft gun shell, and it can stay in the air for several weeks. If necessary, it can also be taken down and re-injected with light gas. If an aircraft's wings touch the balloon, the entire aircraft will be trapped by the barrier balloon and unable to continue flying for several hundred meters. If the aircraft's propeller touches the balloon cable, the fuselage will immediately fall to the ground. If this kind of barrier balloon is installed over the Elbe River, it will be enough to protect the capital's airspace from enemy air raids. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### Spanish Nationalists Express Final Stance: No Amnesty Allowed, but Determined to Maintain Independence. French Representative to Visit Burgos Again.

(London) Well-informed sources here have announced that the Spanish Nationalist government recently sent a note to the British and French governments, stating two points: 1. The government forces must surrender unconditionally, and the Nationalist government will not issue an amnesty decree. 2. The Nationalist government will not tolerate any foreign forces that could undermine the independence and sovereignty of Spain. This is the final statement of Nationalist Commander-in-Chief General Franco. The British government will inform the Madrid Republican government of the British and French efforts to persuade the Nationalist government to cease hostilities, strongly urging them to abandon their resistance policy and informing them that even if the Republican government continues to resist, the British and French recognition of the Nationalist government will not be delayed. Once this is done, the French cabinet will discuss the results of Senator Péret's talks with the Spanish Nationalist authorities. Prime Minister Chamberlain will then formally announce the recognition of the Nationalist government as the legitimate government in the House of Commons early next week. He will also discuss Anglo-Italian relations in light of the recent talks between British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, stating that the continued anti-French propaganda in Italian newspapers is undermining Anglo-Italian relations. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

His entourage is scheduled to travel there the day before. Péret told a Havas News Agency reporter, "France's intention to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government de jure is a unilateral action based on its own free will. There is no negotiation, and no conditions are being proposed. However, before formal recognition, all outstanding issues must be resolved, and misunderstandings must be clarified."

### Discussion of Important Resolutions at the Third Session of the National Political Council: Amendments to the Military Service Law (2 Cases), Improvements to Judicial System (3 Cases), National Spiritual Mobilization Plan

(Chongqing) The Third Session of the National Political Council has concluded successfully. The resolutions passed have been reported daily in previous dispatches. The following is a supplementary report on the discussion and passage of important resolutions:

Two Amendments to the Military Service Law: At this session, the government submitted two proposals concerning the Military Service Law. 1. Proposal to amend the Provisional Regulations on the Military Service Law. The Review Committee's report explained the following: The main significance of the government's proposal is that civil servants, students, and other intellectuals should be conscripted to serve as an example. Furthermore, according to popular custom, only sons are valued more than eldest sons. Therefore, it is proposed to amend the exemption provisions of the Military Service Law. Clause 1 of the original Article 29 (those who are the eldest son in the family) is amended to (those who are the only son in the family). Clause 4 (those who hold a simplified appointment) is deleted and moved to the provisions on deferred service. However, they must still be subject to mobilization and conscription during wartime. Furthermore, Clause 1 of the deferred service (original Article 30), those studying in junior high schools or equivalent schools, is amended to (those who are granted positions above the delegated rank by the central and provincial governments according to the national official system). The Review Committee believes that the government's amendment is sufficient to demonstrate equality and dispel misunderstandings and should be approved. However, it is proposed to amend the first clause of deferred service to (those who are currently holding positions above the delegated rank granted by the central and provincial governments according to the national official system). The remaining amendments to deferred service will be submitted to the government for review and amendment. The resolution was passed according to the Review Committee's opinion. 2. Proposal to promote the widespread implementation of the payment-based deferred service system to benefit military service. The Review Committee's opinion is that military service is a national obligation and should have no exceptions in principle. However, the government's intention is to take into account the facts and reduce abuses. Therefore, it is proposed that the government, in formulating the payment-based deferred service system, should include strict restrictions, stipulate time limits, and implement it temporarily. The measures should be unified, and the area should not necessarily be universal. In order to prevent the current abuses of wealthy sons evading military service, the payment-based deferred service system should have graded regulations, and the minimum amount should be at least 200 yuan per period of deferred service, increasing progressively according to property, so as not to encourage everyone to have a deferred service mentality. All deferred service payments should be designated for the benefit of the families of soldiers on expeditions. The proposed trial period is one year and will be abolished within the 29th year. The resolution was passed according to the Review Committee's opinion. The original text of the two proposals is as follows: 1. Proposal to amend the Provisional Regulations on the Implementation of the Military Service Law. Reasons: The Provisional Regulations on the Implementation of the Military Service Law are important regulations for the implementation of military service. They were amended in April of the 27th year based on experience. Subsequently, the Changsha Supreme Military Council resolved that the exemption provisions in the Military Service Law should be amended, and that eligible individuals of the intellectual class, such as students and civil servants, should also be conscripted as an example. This should be complied with. Also, the previous provision of exempting only sons from regular military service was changed to exempting eldest sons, as only sons often undergo changes, and it is difficult to handle military service matters. For example, if two brothers, one is conscripted into the army, and the other dies at home, the family can request a transfer and send the brother in the army home, which is not only costly but also very troublesome. Therefore, based on the experience of the 25th and 26th years, only sons were changed to eldest sons. However, social customs value only sons, and changing eldest sons to only sons does not create a good social impression. Now, in order to consider human feelings and customs, it is proposed to change the provision of exempting eldest sons from regular military service back to exempting only sons from regular military service. As for the conscription of national soldiers for regular military service during wartime, it seems difficult to implement in the case of only sons. It is proposed to clearly stipulate that they are exempt from conscription. In addition, those whose families cannot maintain a minimum standard of living if they are conscripted into active military service are also proposed to be given discretionary accommodation in consideration of human feelings and facts. All methods of exempting from regular military service and serving in the national army, as well as deferred and suspended service methods, are proposed to be amended accordingly. This is what we should do and respectfully await your decision. 2. Proposal to promote the widespread implementation of the payment-based deferred service system to benefit military service. The purpose of our country's implementation of the Military Service Law and the adoption of conscription is to improve the quality of the army and complete the foundation of military construction. At the beginning of the implementation, it coincided with the start of the War of Resistance, and the replenishment of soldiers became increasingly urgent. Although efforts have been made to promote military service obligations, it is difficult to completely eliminate long-standing habits. Wealthy families often evade military service in various ways, which is difficult to prevent. If handled carelessly, it may lead to corruption. It is proposed to widely promote the payment-based deferred service system, allowing those who are unwilling to serve in the military to pay a corresponding amount of money to be granted deferred service. This method has been quite effective since its implementation in Guangxi Province and seems suitable for widespread promotion to benefit the military administration. The principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength" can be realized, thereby achieving the goal of jointly saving the country. It is most appropriate to use these payments to provide relief to the families of soldiers on expeditions. The reasons for universally promoting the payment-based deferred service system are hereby submitted for your decision. In addition, Councilor Huang Yanpei et al. proposed a motion to assist in improving military service, and Councilor Liang Shuming et al. proposed points that urgently need to be improved in the handling of military service. Separate proposals were also passed and sent to the government for adoption and implementation. The government and the councilors are both closely paying attention to the promotion of military service and striving for improvement. The future of military service is deeply dependent on this.

Various Proposals for Improving the Judiciary: A total of three proposals were submitted at this session regarding the improvement of the judiciary: 1. Councilor Kong Geng et al. proposed a motion to improve the judiciary by adopting the Lu Sanji-ism and abolishing the system of specially appointed vetting officials. This proposal was submitted at the Second Session of the Council, and it was resolved to be reserved for detailed discussion at the next session. Councilor Kong also submitted a memorandum on supplementary opinions for improving the judicial system at this session. 2. The Judicial Yuan submitted a proposal to improve the judicial system. This proposal was submitted by the government based on Councilor Kong's proposal. 3. Councilor Zhou Lan et al. proposed a motion to strengthen the judicial system. The above three proposals were merged for review and submitted at the Fifth Session. The opinion of the Third Review Committee was to suggest to the Council to establish a special committee to be reviewed by legal experts designated by the Speaker to show caution. There was considerable debate at the time. Councilor Lu Dingkui stated that Zhou's proposal was not of a particularly specialized nature and could be discussed by the Council. Kong's proposal and the proposal submitted by the Judicial Yuan should be left for discussion at the next session. Councilor Luo Wengan suggested that Zhou's proposal be discussed by the Council and that the other two proposals be submitted directly to the Legislative Yuan for reference. Later, Councilor Shen Junru made a temporary motion disagreeing with the proposal to postpone the discussion, saying that the Council should not freely abandon its powers and that the proposal submitted by the Judicial Yuan and Kong's proposal, which had not been discussed or reviewed, should be sent to the Legislative Yuan or postponed to the next session. Kong's proposal was originally postponed from the previous session, and the Judicial Yuan was asked to consider it and submit its opinion at this session. Now that the Judicial Yuan respects the Council's opinion and has submitted a proposal, it should be reviewed first. It was then resolved that the Speaker should designate several councilors who study law to form a special review committee to formulate a review opinion and submit it for discussion at the next session. Subsequently, the Speaker designated Zhou Lan, Chu Fucheng, Shen Junru, Lu Dingkui, Zhang Shizhao, Xie Jian, Tao Baichuan, Zhou Binglin, Kong Geng, Luo Wengan, and Shi Liang as members of the special review committee, with Zhou Lan and Luo Wengan as conveners. Councilor Shen Junru et al. also proposed a motion to reduce the litigation burden on the people, which has also been passed and sent to the government for adoption. The above proposals are related to the improvement of the judicial system, and their contents are important. The Review Committee has conducted detailed research, and the Council has also discussed them repeatedly. The councilors have expressed many opinions and debated repeatedly before making separate decisions. The councilors' seriousness and thoroughness in studying major national issues can be seen from this.

National Spiritual Mobilization Plan: At 3:00 p.m. on the 20th, during the eighth session, Speaker Jiang presented a report on the National Spiritual Mobilization, the outline of which is as follows: National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and Implementation Measures. 1. Introduction. 2. Common Goals. 3. Nation Above All, Ethnicity Above All. 4. Military First, Victory First. 5. Concentration of Will, Concentration of Power. 6. Morality of Saving the Country. 7.

Report of the Special Committee:

At the eighth session held on the 20th, the special committee submitted a review report on the implementation of the resolutions of the first and second sessions of the Council, which was passed. The report stated that the first and second sessions of the Council discussed a total of 222 cases, of which about 140 were passed, about 30 were for reference, more than 10 were reserved, and more than 30 were for telegram declarations and revocations. Of the more than 140 cases that were passed, most were of a positive and constructive nature and were beneficial to the War of Resistance and national construction. The Supreme National Defense Council resolved that 98% of the cases transferred by the Council had been distributed to the competent authorities for proper handling, indicating that the government was giving appropriate attention to the resolutions. As for the handling of the transferred cases by the competent authorities, generally speaking, about 80 cases were under review, and about 40 were under review, discussion, or referral. As for the implementation and effects of the cases under review, it is difficult to ascertain the details due to the lack of materials and time. Therefore, in order to promote future implementation effectiveness, the following suggestions are made: 1. The government should urge the implementation of all previously passed cases, and for future cases, when they are distributed to the competent authorities, it is hoped that they will be implemented within a time limit as far as possible. 2. The relevant authorities should provide more detailed reports on the implementation of the Council's resolutions. If there are difficulties or problems in the implementation of important cases or expert reports, please also provide detailed explanations so that we can study and resolve them together. 3. The implementation of each case should be reviewed by the resident committee at any time, and the secretariat should assist in verifying it and report it to the Council at each session. Conveners: Jiang Yong, Hang Liwu.

Statistics on Proposal Results: The Council had a total of 86 proposals, 1 report, and 6 motions submitted by the government. The remaining 80 motions were submitted by the councilors. Except for 2 cases that were left for discussion at the next session and 2 cases that were completely reserved, all other cases were passed and sent to the government for adoption or reference. It is noted that among the 86 motions, those related to domestic affairs were the most, with 28 cases, followed by those related to military and national defense, with 19 cases, economic and financial cases with 18 cases, educational and cultural cases with 17 cases, and diplomatic and international cases with the least, with only 3 cases. In addition, there was one case of a general nature, namely the wartime administrative plan submitted by the government. The first session had a total of 130 cases, the second session had 89 cases, and although this session had only 87 cases, the importance of its content surpassed the previous two sessions.

### London Figures Pay Attention to Situation in Shanghai; Remain Resolved to Confront Japan; Will Not Allow Forced Changes to the Administration of the Concessions

(London) All sectors in contact with Far Eastern affairs are currently anxious about the overall situation in Shanghai. Political circles do not wish to comment on the British government's attitude until the actual nature of the demands made by the Japanese authorities to the Shanghai Municipal Council is known. However, the public remembers that the British government has always treated any move to forcibly change the administration of the Public Concession with a serious demeanor. When the Japanese authorities made demands to the Municipal Council in January 1938, the British government's attitude was resolutely evident. Therefore, Far Eastern observers, based on all past experience, believe that the British government's attitude today will not be less resolute than before. Both the Public Concession and the French Concession are closely surrounded by a vast, disorganized area where thugs gather and law and order are non-existent. It is well known that the Municipal Council faces difficulties in handling affairs under these circumstances. This is undoubtedly true. (Reuters News Agency, 22nd)

### Japanese Troops Invade Hainan Island: Great Impact on Britain, France, and the United States; Hong Kong's Economy First to Suffer

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese army landed troops on Hainan Island at 4:00 AM on the 10th of this month, as previously reported. However, this move by the Japanese has enormous international implications. Further details are as follows:

Hainan Island is the only large island in southern China, with an area of approximately 100,000 square *li* and a population of about four million. Seventy percent of the population is Han Chinese, and thirty percent are indigenous people (the Li people). The Han Chinese reside in coastal areas, while the Li people live in the deep mountains. Some of the Li have assimilated with the Han Chinese, while others maintain a primitive lifestyle, engaging in farming and hunting. The island's climate is mild, with no cold winds even in winter, due to its tropical location and the moderating influence of sea breezes. The weather is pleasant year-round, neither too hot nor too humid. The Wuzhi Mountain range is located in the center of the island, with its highest peak rising 5,000 feet above sea level. The southern part of the island is mountainous, while the northern part is relatively flat. The northern part is separated from the Leizhou Peninsula by a narrow strait, with frequent shipping traffic, resulting in thriving commerce, and a comparatively developed economy and culture. The southern and central parts of the island are isolated due to transportation difficulties, and everything is exceptionally backward. The island is rich in resources, with abundant fishing and salt production, as well as natural mineral deposits. Timber, coconuts, betel nuts, rubber trees, and coffee are also produced in abundance, comparable to Southeast Asia. The island also has several natural deep-water ports around its perimeter, such as Lingao Port, Qinglan Port, Maniao Port, and Yulin Port, which can serve as both commercial and military ports. Therefore, Japan's coveting of the island did not begin today. However, the island's strategic position as the sole passage for British Far East shipping routes and a protective screen for French Anfu (Annam) made it inaccessible to Japan. After the Japanese army invaded South China, Britain and France (especially France) stated that they would not allow the Japanese army to occupy Hainan Island. Initially, it was unexpected that the Japanese army would disregard the protests of Britain and France and resolutely land troops. The reason why the Japanese army dares to invade Hainan Island today can be found in the European situation. In short, France is currently constrained by Italy and Germany in military terms due to the setbacks of the Spanish government forces. Britain, being cautious and prudent, constantly retreats and makes concessions. Japan, as an ally of Italy and Germany, seizes the opportunity to invade Hainan Island. Although Britain and France are threatened, they can do nothing. Therefore, the unfolding of the Hainan Island war situation has a great impact on Britain, France, and the United States. The actions of the Japanese army may escalate tensions in the Pacific.

Hong Kong and Hainan Island are quite close, and their economic relationship is very close. Most of Hainan's various products are exported to Hong Kong, and the daily necessities of the millions of people on Hainan Island are supplied by Hong Kong. At the same time, Hong Kong is densely populated, and a significant amount of its grain and vegetables come from Hainan. Therefore, trade between Hong Kong and Hainan has always been very developed. Since the fall of Guangzhou, Hong Kong's trade has plummeted. Foreign goods are stored in warehouses and cannot be transported to the mainland. Although the demand for mainland products exceeds the supply, there is nothing that can be done. However, trade between Hong Kong and Hainan remained as usual. Now that war has broken out on the island, Hong Kong's commerce will suffer another blow. The Hainanese people residing in Hong Kong mostly make a living by engaging in import and export trade. The Lunar New Year is approaching, and the outbreak of war means that goods scheduled for shipment cannot be delivered on time, and outstanding accounts cannot be settled. The extent of the losses is difficult to estimate. The cessation of shipments of pigs, cattle, and vegetables from Hainan to Hong Kong will also cause food shortages in Hong Kong.

### Fierce Battle Between Chinese and Japanese Troops in Kangcun, Yuhang; Repeated Japanese Attacks Fail; Japanese Major Killed

Yuhang Correspondence: At dawn on the 19th, the Chinese army's position in Kangcun, eight kilometers northwest of Yuhang, was attacked by the Yamada Unit of the Japanese army from Hangzhou. The Chinese army was engaged in training at the time. After hearing the report from the sentry, they ambushed along both sides of the road where the Japanese army was advancing. When the Japanese army had advanced deep enough, more than 200 Chinese soldiers suddenly surged up in one go. The Japanese army was unprepared and suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army then completely surrounded the Japanese army. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the Japanese army desperately wanted to escape, but it was already too late. They resisted stubbornly for a while, trying to break through, but ultimately failed due to a lack of strength and the young age of the soldiers. They were annihilated by the Chinese army's fierce attack. Chinese casualties were minimal. However, about a dozen innocent civilians were brutally murdered by Japanese soldiers. After the news of the defeat reached Hangzhou, the Japanese army dispatched a large force in the afternoon, advancing in four directions. The Chinese army had also received prior intelligence, so they immediately counterattacked. However, the Japanese army advanced with unusual ferocity, once charging towards the Chinese positions with machine guns and then firing sulfur guns at the village houses, attempting to disrupt the Chinese lines. However, the Chinese army's morale was exceptionally stable and continued to fight back. The Japanese army's plan failed again, and they attacked from the flanks, but also failed to make progress. It was said that the Japanese army used diversionary tactics, attacking three or four times, but ultimately failed. By this time, the sun was setting, and darkness enveloped the area. Fearing unfavorable conditions, the Japanese army planned to retreat, but the Chinese army ambushed them on their way back, attacking from both sides. Many Japanese soldiers abandoned their weapons and fled in disarray. In this battle, Chinese soldiers and civilians suffered heavy casualties, but the Japanese suffered even more. Japanese infantry Major Iino Masao was also killed by the Chinese army.

### Bai Chongxi Goes to Shaozhou to Confer on Military Affairs; New Deployment of Anti-Japanese Forces on the Guangdong-Guangxi Border

Guangxi Correspondence: According to intelligence obtained by the Guilin headquarters, the Japanese army has recently concentrated troops and warships in Sanshui and Tuanzhou, intending to attack Sihui, Guangning, and Zhaoqing on the one hand, and to land in the south to seize Beihai and Anpu on the other, in an attempt to open a route into Guangxi. If the Japanese attack Guangxi from Guangdong, they can only do so via the West River and the southern route. Therefore, the authorities have made new arrangements for the defense of the Guangdong-Guangxi border. Before flying to Chongqing from Guilin at the end of last month, Bai Chongxi, the director of the headquarters, passed through Hengyang and went to Shaozhou in northern Guangdong to meet with Zhang Fakui, the acting commander of the Fourth War Zone, and to summon corps commanders Ye Zhao, Li Hanhun, Wu Qiwei, and other senior generals to listen to their reports and hold a short but important meeting. They discussed and decided on several matters: 1. Determining the highest commanders for the four defensive lines in the east, south, west, and north. 2. Adjusting the guerrilla forces and people's self-defense forces on the four lines. 3. Coordinating communication between the battle lines and the supply and replenishment of all military materials. Bai stayed in Shaozhou for two days and then returned to the Guilin headquarters, boarded a plane to Chongqing, and reported in detail to the highest military leaders, and also participated in the Fifth Plenary Session. Bai then completed his duties in Chongqing and returned to Guilin via Kunming on the 6th of this month to deploy forces along the Guangdong-Guangxi border. The defense of the southern route, including Qinzhou and Lianzhou, is the sole responsibility of the Fifth Route Army. The Guilin headquarters has already appointed Wei Yunsong, a military commander of a certain army, as the commander of that route. Xia Wei, the chief of staff of the Fifth Route Army Headquarters, is the commander of the West River upstream defense line from Wuzhou to Zhaoqing. Liang Chaoji and Li Qi, the commanders of the Wuzhou and Yulin civil defense forces, are responsible for the reserve forces and rear transportation and supplies for the two lines. The Fourth War Zone Command is responsible for planning the northern and eastern Jiang defense lines in Guangdong Province. Although the Japanese army has been continuously reinforcing its troops, its plan seems to focus on consolidating the outer defense lines of Guangzhou, and a large-scale attack on Guangxi seems to be pending. Since the first of this month, for five or six consecutive days, the Chinese army on the upper reaches of the West River has had frequent minor skirmishes with the Japanese army entrenched at various points in Sanshui, Hekou, Makou, and Mafang. On the morning of the 4th, a Japanese team built a pontoon bridge from Makou West Bank to cross the West River towards Jinli Market, but it was shelled by a battalion of the Chinese army, destroying the pontoon bridge. More than a hundred Japanese soldiers drowned, and Major Kikawa of the Yoshida Regiment was also killed and his body was transported back to Foshan for cremation. Currently, both armies are shelling each other across the river at Makou and Mafang.

### Garrison Troops in Zhenhai Seize Smuggling Ship; Cunning Merchants Captured as Well

Zhenhai Correspondence: The area around Longshan and Xiepu in northern Zhenhai is located on the coast, and sailboats frequently enter and exit, leading to rampant smuggling. Although the military and police authorities have made every effort to investigate and crack down, the cunning of the merchants is extremely sly. Yesterday, a certain battalion of the garrison troops stationed in the town seized a smuggling ship, fully loaded with smuggled Japanese goods, including cigarette paper. The cunning merchant, Chen Fengzhang, the manager of the Hengpai firm, was arrested, and a large quantity of the same Japanese goods was found in his home. Both the person and the goods were sent to the battalion headquarters. However, the case is complex, and a thorough investigation is currently underway.

### Japanese Army Crushed in Wuzhen; Xu Chunshan's Troops Defect; Japanese Captain Killed in Action

Wuzhen Correspondence: The Japanese army entrenched in the southern sector of Wuzhen attempted to attack the Chinese army led by Zhu Xi, but hesitated to advance. The Japanese army in Hangzhou also posted notices in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, offering a reward of 50,000 yuan for the capture of Zhu Xi. They also stated that a reward of 5,000 yuan would be given for the destruction of a small Chinese army unit or the capture of a city. Unexpectedly, a part of Xu Chunshan's troops, under Xu Pucheng of the puppet pacification force, who were leading the Japanese army, understood the greater cause and secretly contacted the Chinese army. On the 17th, taking advantage of a large-scale attack by the Chinese army, they suddenly led their troops in a defection, shouting, "We are all Chinese, we must turn our guns around and fight the Japanese!" The shouts shook the sky, and the Japanese army was struck like a bolt from the blue, terrified and at a loss. The defecting puppet troops joined forces with the Chinese army to launch a counterattack, with bullets raining down and flesh and blood flying everywhere. The Chinese army's mortar teams and broadsword teams also displayed their bravery, charging towards the Japanese positions. One soldier personally killed six Japanese soldiers and made a heroic sacrifice. The Japanese positions faltered and retreated in disarray, with heavy casualties. A Japanese army lieutenant colonel, Nakamura, was killed on the spot. The Chinese army also captured a traitor named He (from Zhenze, graduated from a law and political science university and served as a Japanese military advisor), and seized a Japanese steamship and countless military supplies. Afterwards, many Korean ronin and Northeasterners were found among the Japanese corpses. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to recapture Xinji, Lianshi, Chongde, Zhouquan, Tongxiang, Shiwan, Tudian Temple, Ripi Bridge, Lutou, and other places. At the same time, the two units of Xu Chong and Zhu Yunqing, under Cheng Wanjun's puppet army, were also annihilated by the Chinese army. The puppet army's strongholds in Jiuguan and Hangjie, between Shuanglin and Nanxun, were completely recaptured. A small detachment of the Japanese army, numbering over two hundred, attempted to encircle the headquarters of the Chinese army in Xinshi from Baimatang, in order to contain the Chinese army's front-line operations. However, they were bravely repelled by over eighty soldiers of the Chinese army's garrison troops under Zhang Xingbai.

### A Puppet Reporter from Cheng Bao Captured and Executed; Head Displayed to the Public at the South Gate

Jiangyin Correspondence: Gao Xueqin, originally named Cao, from Ligang in the western Cheng district, over forty years old, was entrusted by the puppet self-government association to run the Xin Jiangyin puppet newspaper after Jiangyin was occupied by the Japanese army. Gao controlled the editorial policy and engaged in extortion, earning a substantial monthly income. In the middle of this month, Gao was sent by the puppet governor, He Peiyi, to propagandize puppet orders in Zhouyi, Beiguo, and other places in the eastern district. On his return, he was intercepted by the guerrilla forces near Qingyang while traveling on a Cheng-Xi small steamboat. He was handed over to the higher authorities and executed according to the regulations for punishing traitors. His head was sent to the Tianzhutang (Catholic Church) Qianmen outside the South Gate for public display, along with a written statement of his crimes. The local people in the city were extremely terrified upon hearing the news.

Education News

### The Puppet Regime's Slavish Education in Shanghai; Forced Japanese Language Instruction, Deletion of Gymnastics Class; Guerrilla Fighters Burned Down Puppet School Buildings

After the establishment of the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government Education Bureau," it continued to implement the slavish education plan of the former puppet "Great Dao Municipal Government Social Bureau" in the urban area. However, the number of students was extremely small, and it was repeatedly subjected to unreasonable interference from certain parties. The students suffered in silence. The Pudong guerrillas destroyed the puppet "Great Dao Sixteenth Elementary School" building during the Lunar New Year holiday. The details are as follows:

Many Schools, Few Students

The puppet "Social Bureau" divided the city into Pudong, Gaoqiao, Nanshi, Zhabei, Wusong, Jiangwan, Hongkou, and other districts, each establishing puppet schools called "Great Dao Elementary Schools." Pudong and Nanshi had the largest number of schools, with over a hundred in the city. However, the urban population had decreased, and most parents were unwilling to send their children to these schools. Therefore, apart from a few children of hooligans, the students were mostly the children of officials of all ranks in the puppet organization. The number of students in each school ranged from ten to twenty.

Slavish Textbooks and Forced Japanese Language Instruction

The teachers and staff in the puppet schools were mostly those who could barely read and tell fortunes, lacking sufficient knowledge. Those with knowledge were unwilling to lose their conscience and do this work. The textbooks used were compiled by the puppet "Ministry of Education," and the content was based on the originally published textbooks from various bookstores, with all words about revolution, the Party-State flag, martyrs, and other nationalistic thoughts completely removed. They promoted their so-called "Royal Way" fallacy. Portraits of Sun Yat-sen in all schools were uniformly replaced with portraits of Confucius, and Japanese language instruction was forcibly imposed. The gymnastics class was deleted, proving that their intention was to prevent Chinese people from strengthening their bodies.

Frequent Interference by Thugs During Class

During class time in the puppet elementary schools, certain thugs would frequently enter the school under the pretext of visiting, either making fun of the students or verbally insulting the teachers. The teachers were forced to smile in the face of such power, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. Sometimes, they reported the situation to the puppet "Education Bureau," but it was not only fruitless, but they were also scolded for being nosy. Therefore, the schools kept silent about such matters thereafter.

Pudong Warriors Attack School Building

There was a "Great Dao Sixteenth Elementary School" in Pudong, which had a relatively large number of students. However, the principal was particularly obsequious to the Japanese and was very oppressive to the students. Whenever a teacher mentioned the word "Japanese" in class, he would order all the students to stand up and force them to post reactionary slogans. The guerrillas learned of this and, taking advantage of the school holiday during the Lunar New Year when the school was empty, immediately sent personnel to burn down the school building.

### Zhejiang Wartime University Opens; Registration Deadline for Admissions is the End of This Month

The Zhejiang Provincial Government established the Zhejiang Wartime University to cultivate specialized talent and meet the needs of the war effort, appointing a preparatory committee, organizing a preparatory committee, and designating Sanyan Temple in Lishui as the office, responsible for preparing everything, as previously reported. It is now learned that the committee held its second standing committee meeting on the 10th of this month, attended by Chairman Xu Shaodi, members Huang Zupei, Zhao Zengjue, and Mo Dingsen, and decided on the budget for the opening and equipment costs of each college, as well as other important cases. Since publishing a notice to survey students who have dropped out of school in various places, as a basis for opening classes and establishing departments, the committee has been receiving a great number of enthusiastic requests from those who have dropped out of school and who have filled out forms to register with the committee or designated locations. According to a responsible person from the committee, the university plans to first establish the College of Engineering, the College of Agriculture, and the College of Medicine. The College of Engineering will be located in Lishui and will temporarily be divided into three departments: Physics and Chemistry, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and Civil Engineering. The College of Agriculture will be located in Songyang and will temporarily be divided into two departments: Agronomy and Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine. The College of Medicine will be located in Linhai and will be reorganized from the provincial medical and pharmaceutical college, with two departments: Medicine and Pharmacy. The length of study for each college and department, except for the College of Medicine, which is five years, is four years. Tuition fees will be waived. This semester, it is planned to recruit first-year freshmen and transfer students at all levels and conduct centralized training, focusing on life skills and basic academic exercises. Formal class placement will take place in the next semester. The enrollment regulations will be determined and announced after the survey and registration are completed. It is hoped that students who have dropped out of school in various places and wish to study at the university will fill out the form and submit it for registration by the end of February so that comprehensive planning can be carried out and classes can be opened accordingly.

(Chongqing Correspondence) The Ministry of Education is planning to establish a National Hunan Middle School to accommodate the increasing number of students who have dropped out of school from middle schools withdrawn from the Hunan war zone, and to provide them with the opportunity to study.

### Anhui Education Department Establishes Office in Chongqing

(Tunxi Correspondence) Fang Zhi, Director of the Anhui Provincial Department of Education, established a liaison office of the Anhui Education Department in Chongqing, as Anhui Province is far from the wartime capital, in order to facilitate communication between the central government and the local area, and appointed Wu Zunming as the director of the office.

### School News Roundup

Gao's Free Class: Gao's Free Class was founded by Gao Qiaoren, a prominent member of the Gao family in Jiading. It is affiliated with Shanghai Middle School at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road. The free admission qualification for the class was originally limited to young people from Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, and Chongming who could not afford to attend school. Now, for the sake of popularization, it is continuing to recruit twenty new students, without restriction of origin. Anyone who has completed the first semester of the first year of junior high school, is ambitious, and cannot afford to attend school can apply for the entrance examination. Once admitted, all tuition, miscellaneous fees, books, stationery, and other expenses will be waived. This is a great benefit to poor students and is of no small significance. The examination will be held at 3:00 PM on March 1st. Applications can be submitted from today at Room 227, 2nd Floor, Zhonghui Building, 888 Avenue Edward VII.

Second Chinese Vocational Supplementary School: Since relocating to 330 Beijing Road, the Second Supplementary School has added evening classes and clerk classes due to the rapid increase in students.

Famous figures will also be invited to teach in the sixteen classes of Knowledge Lecture, such as Yang Chengfang, Wu Dakun, Qin Bowei, Guan Lu, Jiang Ping, Li Xiaobai, Peng Ruiliang, Fang Xuelu, and Chen Gexin.

Wuxi National Studies College: The Wuxi National Studies College has recently received a large number of requests for elective courses. In order to cultivate talent extensively, President Tang has set up elective regulations, stipulating that one credit for an elective course will cost two yuan per semester, but no more than ten credits. A certificate of completion will be issued upon passing the examination at the end of each semester. If admitted to the regular program, the credits earned will be recognized, but the length of study will not be shortened. In order to limit the level of proficiency, elective students must pass an oral examination and submit their usual literary works for review upon enrollment. Only those who pass will be allowed to register.

Sanwu University: Sanwu University, located at 97 Renji Road, Zhongfu Building, has established a special law course to disseminate legal knowledge. Experts in domestic law and professors from renowned universities have been specially hired to teach the important laws currently in effect in China. The course is designed to be completed in one year, with the aim of enabling ambitious young people and professionals from all walks of life to acquire practical legal knowledge in the shortest possible time.

### Shanghai Education Circle: Opinions on Reforming Education; Opinions on Improving China's Normal School Education (Part 2)

— Wu Zengjie

Establishing Standards for Normal School Students' Training: Regarding the cultivation of normal school students' moral character, the methods adopted by various schools in the past have varied due to different environments. In the future, the Ministry of Education should establish training goals and guidelines so that moral education in normal schools has a clear direction. Before formulating these standards, the Ministry of Education should solicit opinions from normal school authorities and elementary education experts, analyze the qualities of excellent elementary school teachers, and refer to the standards for civic training in elementary schools. The greatest purpose of normal school training is to make students role models for children, because the behavior and personality of elementary school teachers have a great impact on children. The indirect guidance of moral education in schools is more important than direct teaching. Therefore, "personality edification" is above all else. Teachers must be able to lead by example and exert a subtle influence. Only if normal school students have self-cultivation can they become excellent elementary school teachers.

Meeting the Practical Needs of Elementary Schools: The curriculum of normal schools should meet the needs of elementary schools. What is not needed by elementary schools can be deleted. Whether the current normal school curriculum standards meet the needs of elementary schools is still a question. For example, the teaching materials for biology, physics, and chemistry in normal schools focus on the subjects themselves, failing to consider the content of elementary school curriculum. Normal school students often find it difficult to teach because they lack the teaching materials needed by elementary schools. In the future, the normal school curriculum should be revised based on the elementary school curriculum standards in order to meet the practical needs of elementary schools and ensure that normal school students have sufficient qualifications to become elementary school teachers.

The above four points are my personal opinions on improving normal school education. Whether they are appropriate or not, I hope experts will discuss and correct them.

### School Overview: Su Min Vocational School

Su Min Vocational School was founded by vocational education experts Yang Weiyu and Pan Yangyao, industrialists Wu Yun Chu and Fang Jiangge, and other enthusiastic educators. Originally located in Nanxiang Town on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line, it covered an area of over sixty acres. The school originally had nearly a thousand students, including the elementary school, and was a well-known school in the mainland. Provincial and county school inspectors repeatedly inspected the school, considering it to be diligently run with excellent results. In memory of the late educator Mr. Xu Sumin, it was named "Su Min." It was previously registered with the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and filed with the National Government's Ministry of Education. After the "August 13th" Incident, due to environmental concerns, approval was obtained from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and reported to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to relocate to Shanghai. By the summer of last year, it had rented the Siming Bank Building on Nanjing Road as its school building. In addition to cooperating with the China Vocational Education Society to run the Fifth China Vocational Supplementary School (which currently has 1,500 students), the elementary school was also restarted.

The school currently offers both junior commercial and civil engineering programs, each with three levels, all designed for three-year graduation. There are currently 200 students. The elementary school has six levels, with over 300 students. Due to space limitations, each class has a fixed quota. At the beginning of this semester, no fewer than several hundred applicants were turned away due to full enrollment, demonstrating the high regard Shanghai residents have for the school. In terms of equipment, the business department has eight Chinese and English typewriters, and the civil engineering department has state-of-the-art theodolites, levels, plane tables, and other valuable instruments for practical surveying exercises. Other applied teaching aids and experimental supplies are also selectively purchased. The current school building is a four-story Western-style building, with the school occupying the second, third, and fourth floors, totaling twenty-four rooms. There is also a rooftop sports field for student recreation. As for the school's educational philosophy, it adheres to its past spirit, emphasizing practicality and avoiding superficial extravagance. The curriculum strives to be relevant and practical, with serious teaching and strict management. Chairman Pan Yangyao is currently the Director of the Shanghai Office of the China Vocational Education Society and Secretary of the Four-Bank Savings Association. Principal Lu Sheren holds a Bachelor of Education degree from Great China University and has served as principal and teacher in various primary and secondary schools for many years. All faculty and staff are graduates of well-known domestic universities and specialized schools, possessing extensive knowledge and experience. Therefore, graduates of the school are well-prepared for further education or employment. It is said that the previous two graduating classes of the business department are mostly employed in the industrial and commercial sectors or have entered well-known high schools. As for the civil engineering students, many go to work in the mainland, and some have been admitted to the National Land Surveying School. The school maintains the simple and frugal academic atmosphere of the mainland. Male students all have short hair, and female students are not allowed to perm or wear makeup. In warm weather, everyone wears short attire, and in cold weather, they wear blue cloth long gowns. The tuition and fees are also lower than other schools, with middle school tuition at sixteen yuan and elementary school ranging from ten to twelve yuan. Preferential treatment is also offered to poor students and students from war zones.

### Sports News: The Helsinki Olympic World Games: Nineteen Nations Have Reported Participation; China Will Participate in the Marathon and Race Walking; Chongqing's Sports Atmosphere is Booming, Participation is Enthusiastic

(London Dispatch) Nineteen countries have indicated their intention to participate in the Olympic World Games to be held in Helsinki, Finland in 1940. The latest to accept the invitation were the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. Norway has decided not to participate in the gymnastics competition. The United States will send 250 athletes to participate in both the summer and winter Olympic Games (the Winter World Games will be held in St. Moritz, Switzerland). Approximately 50 track and field athletes will be sent, compared to 68 in the previous games. Other important events for the US and Canada include boxing, wrestling, swimming, and fencing. The American Athletic Association has passed a resolution to expand its promotion of the World Games and raise funds for participation. (Reuters)

(Chongqing Dispatch) Chongqing's sports scene has recently been vibrant. The Ministry of Education has decided to participate in the 1940 World Games in Helsinki. In terms of ball sports, athletes will be selected for football and basketball (although there is no basketball in this year's World Games). Participation in track and field is planned to be abandoned. However, the results of the marathon and race walking in the previous games were still quite impressive, and personnel will be sent to perform. During the Sixth National Sports Conference convened here by the Ministry of Education, more than 40 attendees, including Yuan Dunli, Wu Yunrui, Cheng Dengke, and Jiang Xiangqing, resolved that school sports must be included in the entrance examination. Students who fail sports will not be able to graduate. Physical education teachers in various schools must be graduates of physical education colleges. Social sports with excellent results may be reported by the local competent authorities to the Ministry of Education for the issuance of honorary medals. In order to arouse citizens' interest in sports, the Ministry of Education has specifically scheduled a Chongqing Open Cross-Country Race and Bicycle Race on the 26th of this month. Participation is extremely enthusiastic, foreshadowing an unprecedented grand event here.

### Lido Eliminated Yuanchang Yesterday: Won the Junior Cup Final; 1-1 in the First Half, Result 5-1; Group C, Survey Team Forfeited to the Park Alliance

The junior cup football semi-final between Lido and Yuanchang took place at Jiaozhou Park yesterday at 3 PM. The referee was Shen Huichun, and there were over 600 spectators. Lido's main players, Sun Jinshun and Xu Wenkui, were not present, and they were replaced by Jiang Chao and Rong Zhong, greatly reducing their strength. The Yuanchang players calmly fought back, and they were evenly matched with Lido, ending the first half with a score of 1-1. After switching sides, Lido launched a major offensive and scored four more goals, resulting in a 5-1 victory. At the beginning of the game, Yuanchang's Li Songjun committed a foul and was immediately awarded a penalty kick, which was taken by Li Yichen. It hit the crossbar and bounced back, and Lido missed a good opportunity. After eight minutes, Li Yichen led the attack and passed the ball forward, which Jiang Chao kicked into the goal, opening the scoring. After that, it fell into a chaotic battle, and both sides stalemated. Although each side had chances to score, they failed to capitalize. After 35 minutes, Shen Shangde hooked the ball in, Zheng Tongyu failed to stop it, and Cao Qin Fang rushed in and shot into the empty goal, tying the score. The first half ended 1-1, with no winner. When the second half started, Lido tried to rally and launched a strong attack. After 10 minutes, Yuanchang's Zhang Xianlun accidentally handled the ball, and Tan Fuzhen scored a penalty kick. Yuanchang was defeated and fell into decline. Five minutes later, Zhang Mingsheng kicked a corner kick, and Jiang Chao volleyed the ball into the net, making it 3-1. Finally, Li Yichen scored two more goals, and the time ended, and Lido eliminated Yuanchang with a score of 5-1 and won the final. Another Group C game between the Park Alliance and the Survey Team was held yesterday. The Survey Team was unable to attend and declared a forfeit. The Park Alliance won without lifting a finger. The formations for yesterday's game are recorded below:

Lido: Zheng Tongyu, Zhang Xueyao, Zhang Lin gen, Yang Jinling, Tan Fuzhen, Yun Feng, Rong Zengzhong, Cao Qiuting, Li Yichen, Jiang Chao, Zhang Mingsheng

Yuanchang: Fan Jinyong, Wu Jiabang, Liu Kehan, Zhu Jiongpei, Zhang Xianlun, Li Songping, Zhou Qilin, Wu Shaotai, Cao Qinfang, Li Songjun, Shen Shangde

### Bank Basketball League: Salt Industry Lodged a Protest Letter

Yesterday's Game Against Zhejiang Xingye

Weekly Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation: Clothing Special

### Chairman Chiang's Clothing

— Water Bird

In this 20th-century era, a leader's attire does not require as much decoration as in the old feudal times. Chairman Chiang embodies this 20th-century style perfectly. He usually wears Zhongshan suits, Chinese suits, or simple military uniforms. It is rare to see him wearing a Western suit; I have only seen him wear one in his wedding photograph. He seems to have worn Japanese clothing during his youth when he studied in Japan. During the National Scout Grand Review a couple of years ago, Chairman Chiang wore the full dress uniform of a special-grade general for the first time, which was arguably his most magnificent attire. In ordinary times, his clothing is extremely civilian. When reading in his study, he wears a tattered summer linen gown in summer and an old silk-padded robe in winter. His favorite clothing color is snuff brown, and he prefers clean fabrics, absolutely rejecting imported goods and favoring domestic products. Once, Mr. Ma Guoliang and a friend of his went to a tailor shop and accidentally saw a piece of white linen fabric on the table. A small tag next to it read "One piece of fabric for Chairman Chiang." A measurement card was attached. This discovery aroused his curiosity, and the shopkeeper told him that their shop was originally in Nanjing and moved to Hankou after Nanjing fell. Chiang's clothes have always been made by them. He also said, "None of Chairman Chiang's ordinary clothes ever cost more than forty yuan." Such a simple life is rare among leaders in the world today. At the same time, compared to some people in our country who spend twenty or thirty yuan on a pair of socks or shoes, it is truly commendable!

### 1939 Spring Fashion Designs

— Cangqi

### Clothing Purchase Guide

— Huanjun

Before tailoring a garment, to prevent the material from shrinking later, it is necessary to soak it in water first. This refers to the cloth itself. To ensure that silk and wool fabrics maintain their bright and beautiful colors, they cannot be soaked in water, so they can only be sprayed with water. Ordinary people often leave the job of spraying water to the tailor, but tailors often skim off the fabric. If it shrinks after spraying, there will not be much extra. So relying on the tailor to spray water is not reliable; it is best to buy a spray bottle and do it yourself, which is more reliable and worry-free.

When wearing a fancy new robe, the collar is always the first part to get dirty, no matter what. Nowadays, young people wear their hair long, oily, and black, making the collar especially prone to getting dirty. Isn't it a pity that a garment costing twenty yuan or so loses its appearance due to the collar, even though the color is still bright? (Oil stains on the collar are difficult to remove even by dry cleaners, and after cleaning, the color is never as bright as it was originally). So when I buy a garment, I always tell the tailor to cut an extra collar and keep it. When the original collar gets dirty, I can replace it with a new one, and it will still look beautiful and clean, right?

### Crochet Cheongsam

— Zhang Mengzhao

The wheels of time are constantly progressing, and the new contributions of material enjoyment are changing with each passing day! The popularity of crochet fabrics has a long history of decades, and its prevalence has remained constant. In recent years, Chinese and Western crochet products compete to show their unique qualities. Some are excellent in color and texture, while others excel in twisting. The types and styles of crochet are also constantly innovating and changing. Initially, there were only a few simple woven items such as gloves, shoes, socks, vests, and shirts and trousers. Now, with the clever minds and diligent hands of women, shawls, coats, vests, scarves, children's hats, and other items can be turned into very novel and delicate products. The softness and beauty of crochet symbolize the gentleness and beauty of women. Crochet is a sweet companion for young ladies and mothers, and this is true.

Ms. Shen Lin, director of the Lili Knitting Studio, told me that she has a new contribution from 1939—a crochet cheongsam. With a crochet vest and a crochet cheongsam, it is like a lotus emerging from water, even more charming. Moreover, it is as light and warm as fur, and the style is novel. She also said that women's skin tones, figures, and styles are all different. If they are matched with a "crochet cheongsam" of a suitable color, they will have a unique charm. (The author notes that the Lili Studio is located at 1044 Yuwei Road).

### How to Preserve Clothes

— Xie Tianshen

Clothing is a tool for humans to protect their bodies, and it has a close relationship with appearance, etiquette, and hygiene. We must use cleanliness and beauty as the standard when wearing clothes. To maintain cleanliness and beauty, we must pay attention at all times. In addition to washing, we must also preserve clothes to ensure that the materials and colors can be used for a long time without damage. This is not only an important duty of housewives but also knowledge that everyone should have.

The important reasons why clothes last a long time are: first, the material is strong, the color does not fade, and the sewing is fine; second, the preservation is proper.

If clothes are stained with dirt, wash them immediately to keep them clean. Undershirts, socks, and bedding must be washed frequently, because the dirt on these items is not contaminated by other objects, but is composed of sweat and dust. If these dirt are not washed for a long time, mold spots will appear in the dirty areas. Because mold spots contain moisture, they are very likely to damage the quality of the clothes, and the color may fade. Therefore, preserving clothes requires diligent washing.

After wearing clothes, take them off and hang them in direct sunlight to dry. Because clothes absorb moisture from the air and moisture from the body, after being exposed to the hot sun, the moisture will also dissipate, so that they can be dried and will not mold. Clothes that are not often worn should be taken out and dried on dry days every year. Woolen and leather clothing should be taken out and dried from time to time. It is best to dry them in the autumn, and it is also possible in spring and winter. The air contains a lot of moisture in summer, which easily transmits moisture. Direct sunlight can easily fade the colors of brightly colored clothes, so this should be noted.

Place camphor powder or balls in clothing chests or cabinets. Its function can keep them dry and prevent insect infestation. It is best to use expensive, high-quality clothing chests and cabinets, because they can prevent moisture from entering. Paulownia wood chests are best at resisting moisture, because the wood will swell when it encounters moisture, making it difficult for moisture to penetrate. Therefore, chests and cabinets made of paulownia wood are best for storing clothes. If you want to prevent insects, you can use camphor oil or pepper decoction to smear in the gaps to avoid insect infestation.

Clothing chests and cabinets should be placed in a dry place. If the home is located downstairs, it must be raised with wooden frames or sleepers to prevent it from being affected by moisture.

All clothes that are to be stored must be washed clean. If there are clothes that are inconvenient to wash, you can wash them with gasoline and then dry them. All valuables can be wrapped in bundles or parchment paper and then stored.

### Fashion Anecdotes

— Do Not Ask

People living in Shanghai pay considerable attention to clothing. What is the reason for this? It can be expressed with a common saying: "Buddha relies on gold, man relies on clothes," valuing clothes more than people!

Wearing four ounces on the body, burning pomegranate seeds at home. Shanghai people are particular about clothing, so there are more tailor shops than cigarette paper shops. However, Shanghai tailor shops never use the words "Shanghai" to advertise themselves; instead, they use "Su Guang" (Jiangsu and Guangdong) as their unique trademark. A friend who had just arrived in Shanghai was surprised to see "Su Guang Tailor Shop" signs everywhere and exclaimed, "What? Is the business of Su Guang tailors so developed? There are so many branches!" In fact, after Shanghai opened as a port, the most people who came were from Jiangsu and Guangdong. The Guangdong style is unique, so there are separate Guangdong tailors occupying a position. Others, such as those from Ningbo and Shaoxing, are not few in number. However, their clothing is similar to the Jiangsu style, so Jiangsu tailors also occupy a very widespread position. At that time, only Guangdong tailors could go their own way and differ from the Jiangsu style. Later, due to this historical relationship, all Shanghai tailor shops had to add the words "Su Guang" to be qualified for recognition.

Jiangsu tailors had considerable influence in early Shanghai because they often came up with novel ideas and styles to offer to customers who were particular about clothing. Several people who were noticed by society wore new styles of clothing and took a stroll, and then everyone imitated them, creating a trend and being praised for being fashionable. A Western proverb says, "Those who like to dress up are the toys of tailors," which seems to be mocking the fashion in Shanghai. It was said that the most novel women's clothing at that time was worn by courtesans, so they held the authority on clothing. Respectable women, obsessed with fashion, were not ashamed to mix imitation jade with real jade, willingly dressing like them in order to meet the conditions for being fashionable. Later, the thinking of courtesans gradually lagged behind, unable to keep up with the times and progress with each passing day. At the same time, many socialites, movie stars, and dancers emerged to take over the authority of clothing because their clothes imitated Europe and America, combining health with gracefulness, and the styles were new and not old-fashioned. Not only were they admirable for their daily changes, but they also had changes happening from dawn to dusk, thus becoming the most modern model for women's clothing, which laid the foundation for "fashion." As a result, "fashion" companies emerged. The so-called "fashion" is completely European and American in style, which cannot be manipulated by Jiangsu and Guangdong tailors. Therefore, the influence of Su Guang tailoring almost collapsed. Fortunately, several clever "Su Guang" tailors tried hard to adopt European styles and change to new methods, improving a size chart by dividing the upper, middle, and lower parts into several stages, measuring the size to the nearest fraction, daring not to be careless. Therefore, even now, the fate of "Su Guang" tailor shops can still survive precariously. However, for wedding dresses, banquet dresses, dancing dresses, swimming attire, overcoats, and coats, one must patronize fashion companies. Su Guang tailor shops can only sigh in despair!

Clothing, food, and housing are three necessities of life, and "clothing" comes first, which shows that the importance of clothing in life really surpasses food and housing. In ancient times, scholars were called "dressed gentlemen," and ceremonial caps and ribbons were all the clothing of officials, so descendants were also called "ceremonial hats and ribbons." Ouyang Xiu said, "Clothing covers the multitude, providing for all things," referring to the meaning of benevolence and righteousness spreading throughout the world. Buddhist monks and disciples are collectively called "robe and bowl." Novels often describe the dynamics of boudoirs with the phrase "fragrant clothes and shadowed hairpins." Being rich and not returning to one's hometown is satirized as "wearing brocade to travel at night." This is the poison of feudal thought, so do not imitate it. The common saying is, "Brothers are like hands and feet, husband and wife are like clothes." Clothes can always be changed for something new, so husband and wife can always get divorced, which shows that traditional Chinese thought has long implicitly recognized the possibility of divorce. However, it is deeply hoped that future couples will never again use "clothing" to describe the way of husband and wife; otherwise, it is not contagion or silent transformation, but being greatly deceived by the ancients.

Mencius said, "Even if someone bares his arms and body beside me, how can he defile me?" The meaning is that exposing arms and bodies is an impolite act, but it cannot defile Mencius. "Tan" means rolling up sleeves to expose arms; "xi" means rolling up sleeves to expose fur; "luo" means being naked; "cheng" means being stark naked. At present, women's fashion cuts off the sleeves, almost exposing their armpits, which is not surprising. In dance halls, grass skirts and pajamas are used as an attractive gimmick. This stage is even more extreme than "tan," "xi," "luo," and "cheng," so it anesthetizes the masses, piercing through to the top, no wonder general dancers rush to it in alarm.

Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Education Group Special Issue for Raising Funds for Refugee Production and Education

### The Importance of Refugee Production and Education

— Ni Fengmei

The promotion of refugee relief work by all sectors of the city can truly be described as making every effort. It began with large-scale accommodation, providing clothing and food, then vigorously implementing thrift and sharing weal and woe, and finally promoting production and education, from passive to active, and carrying out construction and remediation after destruction, so that human and material resources are no longer wasted in the slightest, in order to invisibly enhance the country, which can be said to be a major progress in our arduous journey.

In the past, what we called refugee relief was mostly based on charitable donations, and its purpose was only to provide relief. Those in charge of it were also regarded or regarded themselves as having boundless merit. However, the nature of what is called refugee relief today is completely different. Why are there so many refugees within the country? We should first recognize the reasons for its creation, and then we will know that our relief to our compatriots in distress is not only based on a sense of humanity, but there are more important factors in between. Only in this way can the compatriots in distress, although relying on relief to survive, also consider how to benefit the country and the nation, and not just live in vain.

Therefore, we have the necessity to make refugees engage in production. Today, the general opinion is that there is no good way to improve the lives of refugees other than relief. The so-called production is also afraid of being nominal and not real, outweighing the gains, or that relief to refugees has been going on for more than a year, why not consider it earlier? In addition, the city's industrial and production machinery has suffered from destruction, and imported goods are supplied to maintain difficulties. How can we start to promote it to achieve satisfactory results? We are not unaware of the magnitude and difficulty of this work, but transforming the situation and overcoming the environment are precisely what every citizen should practice today. Only by facing complex problems can we see sharp tools. Therefore, we can use this opportunity to use collective wisdom and strength to implement the principle of those with money contributing money and those with strength contributing strength, and lay a solid foundation for the permanent self-sufficiency of people's livelihood and daily necessities. If machinery is destroyed, our country's highly developed handicraft industry can rise to replace it. If foreign goods are expensive and supply is insufficient, then domestic goods can be produced in large quantities to fill the gap. How can we see that refugees cannot engage in production and that production plans cannot be put into practice? Moreover, in addition to cherishing material resources and developing the economy, we must make refugees work hard, exercise their bodies, and unify their will to prepare for the struggle for survival. In this era of great torrents, a group of citizens who are full all day and do nothing are definitely not allowed.

Second, it is necessary to educate them. The number of illiterates in our country is unparalleled in the world, so education is particularly important in our country. Educating refugees is not only to eliminate illiteracy, but also to shoulder the responsibility of cultivating healthy citizens. Our country today is concentrating all human and material resources to seek the final survival. Refugee production is a part of mobilizing material resources, and educating refugees is to make them understand the meaning of this nation-building and know how to be loyal to the country. At the very least, all the new social education goals set by the country must be made clear to them. We should know that good citizens educated in refugee life are of greater significance and educational value. We should also know that education and production are related. Promoting refugee production through educational methods can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Today, the city's education sector has taken the lead in raising funds for refugee production and education. I know that this movement will surely touch the sympathy of the vast majority of people. Although success depends on the strength of the masses, advocacy must start from oneself. When the wind blows, the grass bends, and there will be success as long as there is initiative. I hope that teachers and students in the city's education sector will take on the responsibility bravely and achieve success quickly.

### Abolishing the Lunar New Year and Fundraising

Abolishing the Lunar New Year is a happy day. All industries are closed, and everyone seeks some happiness. In order to seek happiness, spending money is naturally more than usual. Lao Tzu said: "The way of heaven, is it not like stretching a bow?" Stretching but not relaxing makes life feel painful. One stretch and one relaxation are enough to restore tired spirits. For the sake of the body and for the sake of the career, it is appropriate. Although we are facing a great disaster and wailing can be heard everywhere, finding joy in suffering is to increase the spirit of struggle and extend the time of struggle. Seeking happiness during the New Year is not entirely blameworthy.

However, in extraordinary times, leisure is different from prosperous times. Simply seeking happiness is a bit suspicious of decadence, and truly patriotic people certainly do not want this. The best way is to seek happiness while not forgetting the current disaster. In concrete terms, it is to propose a part of the entertainment expenses to be used for disaster relief. Enjoying without forgetting disaster relief is called joy without excess. Disaster relief without forgetting enjoyment is called sorrow without injury. Joy without excess is righteousness, and sorrow without injury is courage. Isn't it the best attitude in life to have both righteousness and courage? Promoting refugee education and increasing refugee production is the unshirkable heavenly duty of disaster relief for us Shanghai people. During this abolished Lunar New Year, everyone save some entertainment expenses to do this good deed. The spirit of "treating the people as my compatriots" is completely expressed through action. This is a meaningful and valuable move. From a personal point of view, this shows the attitude of life. From the perspective of the entire Shanghai, this shows the demeanor of a great citizen. Saving some New Year entertainment expenses to harvest these two major effects, everyone just needs to use a calm mind and think carefully, and everyone will be happy to agree.

As for the education sector and young people in Shanghai, everyone believes that thinking is relatively advanced. It is appropriate to use the abolished Lunar New Year to save entertainment expenses and use them for refugee education and production, using actions to arouse social sympathy, and creating a very strong atmosphere throughout Shanghai with the words "If I don't save the refugees, who will?" Such education circles and young people deserve to be called the advanced education circles and advanced young people!

A Public Letter to the Social Community regarding Fundraising for Refugee Education and Production Expenses

Since the establishment of the Municipal Refugee Relief Association, we have been deeply admired by the enthusiasm of the social community to share their hunger and thirst, and the sympathy of mutually sharing clothing and food, so that more than 100,000 refugees who have been wandering in the city have no fear of freezing and hunger. However, although this passive work has achieved considerable results, active work such as education and production has not yet begun. The education and cultural circles have recently launched a fundraising movement for refugee education and production expenses. Among the refugees in the city's various shelters, there are more than 60,000 adults and more than 30,000 children. In the past, they were all self-sufficient citizens, but now they have suffered hardships due to the war and are barely surviving in the shelters. They have little opportunity for education and lack productive skills. If this continues for a long time, they will only be consumers and illiterates, and the impact is unimaginable. The colleagues in the education and cultural circles feel unbearable and are deeply worried. They love the principle of pooling wisdom and strength and jointly plan the righteous act of those with money contributing money, and launch a fundraising movement for education and production expenses, with a temporary goal of 100,000 yuan. It is deeply hoped that all schools and social people will rise up together and promote each other, so that the refugee education and production plan can be realized as soon as possible, so that refugee children will not be deprived of education, and refugee adults will have productive skills to be self-sufficient. Those who donate one yuan will be given a commemorative badge from the Refugee Relief Association, and additional reward measures will be set. Schools and students with excellent fundraising results will be given a plaque of merit by the Association to promote benevolence. However, this movement intends to obtain the most satisfactory results in the shortest possible time and achieve the best harvest with the most economical methods. Therefore, what is imagined must be announced to the social community, including the following: This movement is being launched during the Lunar New Year, and folk customs often include banquets and New Year greetings. Students can take the opportunity to donate the money earned from candy fees and New Year's money to refugee production and education expenses. Individuals can save unnecessary extravagance, and society can carry out effective undertakings. It is the greatest good to take advantage of the opportunity. As for fundraising from the outside world or public places, it is not adopted by the Association, because it not only affects the academic course but also relates to the order of the concession and the safety of students. This is the first thing that should be declared to the social community. The Association's fundraising this time is purely based on the purpose of voluntary assistance. The social community has different degrees of wealth, and the economic situation of the students is naturally different. Therefore, the amount that a school's students can donate should never be forced. It is hoped that everyone will embrace the world with kindness and donate as much as they can to gather strength and achieve complete success. This is the second thing that should be declared to the social community. Finally, I would like to add a word to the education community, that is, although the city's education community has made efforts to promote refugee relief in the past, a small part has failed to do their best, which has caused some disappointment in public opinion. The education community is the forerunner of society, and society expects a lot. According to common sense, this should not have happened. Now that there is a general mobilization of refugee education and production expenses, it is hoped that people in the education community will quickly catch up and establish a reputation that will not fall. The results are the touchstone of our education community's enthusiasm for charitable undertakings. If all can participate, then our entire education community can be shown to society, so that our entire education community will be exempted from unexpected accusations. This is the third thing that should be declared to the social community. Now that the fundraising movement is about to be launched, I dare to hope with a sincere heart that the social community will give it enthusiastic sympathy, so that these more than 100,000 refugees will have the opportunity for production and education in addition to ensuring their livelihood, which is fortunate.

### The Japanese side lodged a written protest yesterday regarding the terrorist incident. It was delivered to the Bureau of Public Works yesterday afternoon. The police force in the Concession is sufficient and there is no reason to criticize it.

In the Huaxi area of this port, due to the erratic comings and goings of miscellaneous people from the Chinese community, cases of armed killings have occurred repeatedly. Although the Public Concession authorities have a police force to ensure the security of the Concession, due to the proximity of the extra-territorial roads of Huaxi to the Chinese community, they are unable to fully clear up such cases because they are limited by the Chinese community and cannot cooperate in preventing them in practice. However, the Public Concession Police Department still upholds its past spirit and tries its best to maintain law and order within the Concession.

Using the Chen case to make wild accusations

Since Chen Lu, the pseudo "Foreign Minister of the Reformed Government," was killed, the Japanese side has exaggerated its accusations in every possible way. Japanese personnel in Tokyo and Shanghai have issued various strong statements in the name of curbing so-called "terrorism" cases. However, Chen Lu's assassination was carried out by people entering and leaving the Chinese community. In order to achieve its long-held wishes, the Japanese side, represented by Consul Miura stationed in Shanghai, lodged its "protest" with the Concession authorities.

The Japanese side lodged a written protest yesterday

According to the Modern News Agency, after a series of shooting cases occurred in the Concession, Japanese Consul General Miura visited Fenkling, the chairman of the Bureau of Public Works, twice, blaming the Concession's police force for being weak and insufficient to maintain law and order. He also submitted a written protest to the Bureau of Public Works at 3:00 PM yesterday. The content of the wording is unknown to the outside world. It is reported that the Japanese side believes that the Concession police authorities have not made every effort to prevent and take harsh measures in the past shooting cases, and therefore should bear the responsibility. In addition, it also put forward two reservations, requesting a large increase in the number of Japanese police officers so that the Japanese side can fully cooperate with the police authorities to maintain law and order; the Japanese armed forces have the right to take direct action in the Concession area when necessary. It is said that this written protest was issued after consultation between Tokyo and Shanghai. The attitude of the Bureau of Public Works will be decided after consideration, and then a reply will be given, or it is intended to report to the consular corps first to decide everything.

It is also learned that the Bureau of Public Works is also paying considerable attention to this matter. Yesterday afternoon, senior officials slightly mentioned it in private, which is said to be out of concern for their duties.

Complex content with no new discoveries

The North China Daily News reported that when a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy received reporters last night (21st), a reporter asked whether the Japanese authorities had received a reply from Japanese Consul General Miura regarding the protest he lodged with Fenkling, the chairman of the Bureau of Public Works, due to the atrocities that occurred in the Public Concession on Sunday. The spokesman replied that Miura had met with Mr. Fan, but the content of such cases was complex, and he was unwilling to discuss them at present. The matter is currently under study. When asked whether the Japanese authorities intended to take military action in the Public Concession, the spokesman replied that he could not provide any information on this point at present. The spokesman also detailed the circumstances of Chen Lu's death, saying that there were no new discoveries in addition to the reports. The Police Department of the Bureau of Public Works has arrested several people in connection with the case and is cooperating with the Japanese military police.

The police force in the Concession is very sufficient

According to foreign sources obtained by the Modern News Agency, the Concession authorities have been doing their best to maintain law and order since the Shanghai war, and the results can be said to be the best. The police force is very strong. For example, there are about 4,000 Chinese police officers, and there are more than 2,000 Western, Japanese, Indian, and other police officers, for a total of more than 6,600 people, which is more than enough to deal with all emergencies. In addition, there are more than 2,000 members of the International Volunteer Corps, including the ABC three major teams, machine gun teams, air defense teams, White Russian teams, etc., who can be mobilized to take action in the event of an incident. In addition, there are British and American defense forces to provide assistance. Therefore, the efforts of the Concession authorities to maintain law and order are really beyond reproach. The fact that general traitors and Japanese puppet figures have fled to the Concession because they cannot withstand the attacks of the guerrillas in the interior is enough to prove that the prevention in the interior is far less serious and thorough than that in the Concession. The Japanese side's accusation that the Concession's maintenance is ineffective this time is actually an excuse for its attempt to exert pressure. It is said that the Concession authorities are determined to uphold their past spirit, work hard to maintain law and order, and will not allow the Japanese side to criticize them.

### Money and Financial Businesses - Opening Today, Hongxiang and other Remittance and Money Shops Decide to Close Down, All Markets Open for Business Simultaneously

The final accounting period for the 27th year of the Republic of China has passed. All businesses will fully open today. Money shops and money exchange stores will open simultaneously. Remittance shops such as Hongxiang have decided to close down. The money business association will hold a committee meeting to discuss new business guidelines. Details are as follows:

Money Shops Open, Banks Resume Business

A total of forty-three money shops are members of the Money Business Association. Those opening for business must report to the association this morning and will distribute account books starting today. The association has scheduled an executive committee meeting for 2:00 PM on the 25th to discuss new business guidelines. The annual meeting will be held on March 3rd at the Money Business Association Hall in the northern part of the city, with a memorial service for past directors. The four money exchange stores, Fulushouxi, members of the Money Exchange Business Association, will also begin operations today. The association will hold an executive committee meeting, a New Year's dinner, and discuss business guidelines. Banks have completed their spring holiday and will resume business today.

Hongxiang and Other Shops Voluntarily Close

A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency interviewed a leader in the money business yesterday. According to him, various industries in the Shanghai concessions developed abnormally last year, the 27th year of the Republic of China. All loans issued by the shops were recovered, so the businesses were doing well and able to make a slight profit. However, it is said that several remittance shops, including Hongxiang, decided to close down voluntarily because their shareholders had no intention of continuing. Also, certain other shops have completed their reorganization and will open as scheduled. A reporter also interviewed a member of the Money Exchange Business Association yesterday. According to him, the money exchange business is better after the war than before. Many new businesses have been established. Members previously in Hongkou have also moved south of the Suzhou Creek to operate.

Markets Open Today

After the general accounting period for all businesses, all preparations have been completed. Most will open for business today. Markets for soybeans, rice, money, money exchange, sugar, and miscellaneous grains will also open today. The informal stock, yarn, and flower exchanges will also resume trading at the same time. Yesterday was the fourth day of the first lunar month (commonly known as the day to welcome the God of Wealth). Old-style factories and businesses welcomed the God of Wealth, so many peddlers were selling "Wubao fish" (a type of dried fish) in the market. In addition, various shipping companies have resumed operations on all routes since the day before yesterday. Vessels that were docked in Shanghai for annual repairs will join their original routes as soon as the repairs are completed.

### Intimidation Tactics, Japanese Side Makes Empty Threats, Japanese Association Plans to Take Decisive Action, Japanese Army and Navy Hold Emergency Meeting Yesterday

Since the assassination of Chen Lu, the puppet "Foreign Minister of the Reformed Government," in an area outside the concessions, the Japanese side has seized the opportunity to protest to the Municipal Council. The Japanese residents in Shanghai have also added fuel to the fire, holding meetings to urge the Japanese authorities to take decisive action. However, the Municipal Council has taken a firm stance, and its police force is sufficient to maintain order. The Japanese side has no grounds for intervention. Details are as follows:

The Chen Lu Incident

The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 21st), the Japanese-language Continental News published an article claiming that the puppet Foreign Minister Chen Lu of the "Reformed Government" was assassinated in the British defense zone. Therefore, the "Reformed Government" is gradually demanding that the British troops withdraw from their defense zone. The British authorities are trying to avoid acknowledging the responsibility of the "Reformed Government," claiming that they were not notified of Chen Lu's arrival in Shanghai. However, even though they do not recognize the "Reformed Government," it is only natural that they should pay special attention to and protect those holding important positions in the "Reformed Government." Using the excuse that they were not notified of Chen Lu's arrival in Shanghai to evade responsibility is equivalent to admitting that they are unable to maintain peace and order in their own defense zone.

Demanding the Arrest of the Culprits

Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said at a press conference today that senior Japanese officials are still considering appropriate measures to deal with the terrorist incident in Shanghai and are expected to lodge a formal protest soon. He said that the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Army Minister, and Navy Minister met last night and sent a telegram to the Japanese authorities in Shanghai demanding that the Public Concession Municipal Council immediately arrest the murderers of Chen Lu, the Foreign Minister of the "Reformed Government," and the Chinese terrorists who committed "thirty similar acts of violence." He also demanded that the Municipal Council take steps to prevent future terrorist incidents. If the Municipal Council fails to arrest the culprits and the violence continues, the Municipal Council will be notified that the Japanese government considers the Municipal Council unable to maintain peace and order in the Public Concession. At that time, the Japanese government will take appropriate measures to maintain peace and order in the Public Concession, and if necessary, will exercise "the right to use force for self-defense."

Japanese Residents Meet

The Continental Daily reported that last night (the 21st), the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun reported that the Emergency Committee of Japanese Residents in Shanghai, consisting of leaders of the Japanese community in Shanghai, held a special meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the situation in the city, focusing on the threat of political terrorists to Japanese civilians. The Japanese Consul General, Miura, also attended the meeting. At the same time, the idea of convening a mass meeting of Japanese residents to urge the Japanese authorities to take more decisive action and allow them to take decisive action in the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek is growing. A member of the committee said that before this mass meeting can be held, representatives of the Japanese community must consult with the army, navy, and diplomatic authorities to discuss a solution. The Shanghai Japanese Journalists Association also held an emergency general meeting in a building at the corner of Zha Lu Road and Peng Lu Road yesterday to demand the clearing of political terrorism cases in Shanghai, passing a resolution demanding that the Japanese authorities use "drastic measures" to deal with the Municipal Council.

Councilor Returns to His Country

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post reported that Morishima, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, was summoned back to his country to report on the situation in Shanghai, especially in connection with the outbreak of terrorist incidents, and left for Tokyo by plane at 9:30 this morning (the 22nd).

Flagship Meeting

Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd. According to Japanese sources in Shanghai, Japanese diplomatic, naval, and army authorities held an emergency meeting on the Japanese flagship Izumo in Shanghai and decided that if the Public Concession Municipal Council could not handle the terrorist incidents satisfactorily, they would "take independent action to maintain peace and order in Shanghai."

Saito Arrives in Shanghai

Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd. According to Japanese sources, Saito, the former police chief of Tokyo, left here today for Shanghai.

### Ministry of Finance Cares for the Suffering of the Poor, Orders Pawnshops to Reduce Interest Rates, Agricultural Bank Extends Loan Terms to Pawnshops, Pawnshops in War Zones Should Allow Redemption Without Losses

While the National Government is busy with the military operations of the war of resistance, it is still deeply concerned about the suffering of the people. Pawnshops in various places mostly charge very high interest rates due to capital turnover issues, and the redemption periods are too short, which greatly affects the livelihoods of the poor. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has issued a notice to the provincial and municipal governments, instructing them to rectify the pawnshops, reduce interest rates, and extend the redemption periods to benefit the poor. The Ministry has also ordered the China Farmers Bank to consider the situation in various places and provide low-interest loans to pawnshops to ease their financial difficulties, so that both the difficulties of merchants and the suffering of the poor can be addressed. Also, pawnshops in war zones, even though they have transported the pawned goods to safe areas, still falsely claim that they have suffered losses due to the war, making it impossible for farmers to recover their clothes and ornaments. This kind of behavior is no different from robbing people by taking advantage of the situation. The Ministry has also ordered the local authorities in various places to investigate the matter separately. Those who have not suffered losses should allow as much redemption as possible.

### Unable to Withstand Japanese Puppet Oppression, Ferryboats Go on Strike, All Industries Ask for Assistance to Discuss Joint Resistance

In the Changyinsha, Hupu, Baimao and other places along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Japanese army and navy are constantly in conflict over the rights of the port, causing the port ferryboats (Yanghua boats) to be ordered to be checked by the Japanese warship when loading goods or passengers to be transported to the outer wheel outside the port. If they are not satisfied, they will shoot and kill people at will. The lives of boatmen are not guaranteed. In order to resist this barbarous act, the ferryboats in each port suddenly went on strike yesterday when the local industries opened. All the big and small ferryboats were driven into the inland river to dock, and the oars, rudders, masts and sails were dismantled. The attitude was quite resolute. There are many local products from the shops in various industries waiting to be shipped to Shanghai, which are piled up everywhere, and the situation is very urgent. However, not only the boatmen are victimized by the various oppressive acts of the Japanese army and navy stationed along the river, but also the innocent merchants and people are killed. The Japanese military authorities have never been heard to have taken severe measures. This proves that the Japanese are condoning the troops and raising evil people. Therefore, they express sympathy for the ferry boat strike, which is a violent act of resistance, and are planning an effective method to carry out the struggle.

### Hungarian Ship Adada, Japan Still Has Not Released, No Information in Xiamen

The Zi Lin Bao reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Navy told reporters yesterday (the 21st) that the Hungarian ship Adada, which was hijacked by a Japanese Navy patrol ship a few weeks ago and escorted to Xiamen, is still detained in the port. The spokesman did not receive any formal information from the Xiamen authorities, but he believed that the crew of the ship had been released.

### A Japanese Warship Was Hit and Damaged, Landing in Haimen Failed, Japan Blockaded Jiaojiang, Hindering Navigation, There Were Artillery Battles and Japanese Aircraft Reconnaissance in Haimen

Since the Japanese warships bombarded Haimen in eastern Zhejiang on February 18 in an attempt to land, they were bravely repulsed by the garrison. The Japanese warships blockaded Jiaojiang in Haimen and sent aircraft to reconnaissance various parts of eastern Zhejiang. The fire along the river in Haimen has been extinguished, and a Japanese warship was hit and damaged. Details are as follows:

Fire Extinguished

After the Japanese warships concentrated in Taizhou and Haimen in eastern Zhejiang, they bombarded Haimen for several days. The shells fell on the wasteland on the north bank, and our side suffered no losses. However, the Haimen Water Police Office was hit by a shell, but fortunately there were no casualties. Japanese aircraft flew over various parts of eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance for several days, but did not drop bombs. The fire along the river in Haimen, which started on the 20th, has been extinguished, destroying hundreds of houses. It is said that the fire was set by traitors to respond to the Japanese army's landing. Fortunately, the Japanese army failed to succeed due to our side's brave selection and attack. The Japanese plan completely failed.

Blockade of Jiaojiang

Jiaojiang in Taizhou (i.e. Taizhou Bay) has been completely blockaded by our garrison, and mines and other objects have been placed to prohibit ships from entering or leaving. The blockade line is very solid. Today, because the Japanese army failed to land, they towed several sailing boats loaded with sand and gravel, which they took from the sea the night before, to the mouth of Jiaojiang and sank them next to the blockade line, and erected bamboo poles as markers. The purpose was to block Jiaojiang so that ships could not enter or leave. Now the bamboo poles and other objects have been blown up by our side.

Japanese Warship Hit

A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency interviewed crew members of the Meiyuan, a ship that arrived in Shanghai from Yongbo yesterday. According to them, according to news from the Ningbo authorities, on the 18th, two Japanese warships sailed to the Jiaojiang blockade line and fired on Haimen. The local garrison immediately returned fire. One of the Japanese warships was hit by a shell and was seriously damaged. It immediately stopped firing and left Jiaojiang, apparently to be repaired elsewhere. Currently, there are still many Japanese warships outside the mouth of Jiaojiang, and the Jiaojiang blockade line has not been broken by the Japanese.

Ningbo and Wenzhou Under Martial Law

According to news from the shipping industry, although war has broken out in Haimen, eastern Zhejiang, Ningbo and Wenzhou, as ports in eastern Zhejiang, have been placed under special martial law. The Yong River in Ningbo and the Ou River in Wenzhou have been closed to night navigation, and ships entering and leaving are subject to strict inspection. Although a waterway is left open for navigation in the blockade, the entire blockade can be implemented if necessary. Both places have defensive works and are stationed with heavy troops, but the area is as peaceful as ever, and all industries are open for business as usual. Although Japanese aircraft have passed through, they have not dropped bombs. As for Dinghai Island, ships are prohibited from docking. The police and militia on the island maintain order.

Reported in Western Newspapers

The Zi Lin Bao reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Navy told reporters yesterday (the 21st) that the Japanese Navy authorities have blockaded the port of Haimen and built a water barrier in the port on the 19th of this month. The Japanese side has notified all countries that this measure was taken for military needs. The spokesman also replied to questions that military supplies were transported through Haimen to the Chinese army, and also said that the Japanese army did not attempt to land in Haimen.

### To Enhance the Love of Husband and Wife - The Weak and Kidney Deficiency Must Be Eliminated Quickly

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

The impact of kidney deficiency on the love of husband and wife has become an iron law, which cannot be denied. Looking at divorce cases, especially regarding the husband's inability to fulfill his reproductive responsibilities, the wife's side is often justified and has sufficient reasons. This shows the great impact of kidney deficiency on family peace and personal happiness.

Speaking of the causes of kidney deficiency, it is most common in the elderly. This is due to physiological reasons and comes from the reduced excitability of the central nervous system. If it is a young person, apart from excessive sexual activity or masturbation, which leads to kidney deficiency, people who usually smoke and drink excessively will also have their central nervous system anesthetized, reducing its function. Over time, kidney deficiency will definitely occur.

In addition, excessive weakness of the body, or diseases such as diabetes and nephritis, can also reduce erectile function. Also, excessive fatness, spinal cord tuberculosis, etc., can also eliminate its reproductive function. All other diseases can cause physical weakness, and sexual desire will definitely decrease accordingly.

As for kidney deficiency caused by excessive sexual activity and self-injury from masturbation, it is called "sexual neurasthenia." Kidney deficiency caused by neurasthenia also causes the ejaculation center to lose its effectiveness, which is called "paralytic kidney deficiency." With this kind of problem, sexual life after marriage is very painful.

The above-mentioned types of kidney deficiency are indeed a lifelong shackle for patients, but from the results of practical experiments by famous doctors in various countries, it is proven that the above-mentioned diseases can only be cured with endocrine agents. Other therapies can only be used as an aid. Famous doctors such as (ChixsostomM.D.Drhunter) and scientists such as Dr. Ploled, etc., compiled various endocrine agents from around the world for chemical analysis and animal experiments. The results proved that the male "Buti Kang," a preparation of the youthful glands of majestic animals "i.e., the entire testicles" invented by the German physiologist Dr. Meulen, is the most effective. When I was in Russia, I made dozens of chemical tests of the ingredients of "Buti Kang," proving that the animal testicles it contains are mainly chimpanzees, so its effect is far superior to similar preparations. Regular consumption can indeed rejuvenate. The female Buti Kang has the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting conception.

### Frequent Nocturnal Emission Should Be Actively Saved

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

Frequent nocturnal emission indicates that the spermatic valve has become loose and unbearable, and at the same time, the youthful glands that dominate sexual desire also lose their prosperity due to the constant flow of semen. Also, committing masturbation and nocturnal emission when development is not yet complete can lead to incomplete development and short and small genitals. As for the weakness of brain nerves, it is closely related to nocturnal emission. Each time masturbation is committed, a large amount of blood is consumed. Over time, the function of its metabolism decreases, and then insomnia, forgetfulness, mental fatigue, headache, palpitations, night sweats, tinnitus, pale complexion, and sore limbs will follow one after another.

If a patient with nocturnal emission falls into the above-mentioned symptoms, not only will it have a great impact on health, but also his lifelong happiness will be unimaginable! Therefore, he should actively treat it in order to save it. According to the most advanced treatment method, he should take "Ners Nocturnal Emission Tablets." The tablets are effective quickly and can permanently cure nocturnal emission. If various symptoms of weakness have already been caused, he should also take the testicular essence preparation "Buti Kang" to replenish losses, which can be completely cured.

### The Latest Strong Military Equipment in Various Countries

— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

Cannot but give credit to the invention of the specific drug for gonorrhea

The crisis of world war is approaching day by day, and is imminent. The navies, armies and air forces of various countries are locked in an atmosphere of tension. In order to prevent the decline of the energy of the soldiers in wartime and cause failure, before the war, the military authorities of various countries specially dispatched appointed doctors to conduct strict examinations of the soldiers individually. After detailed examination, it was found that about 70-80% of them had venereal diseases, and gonorrhea was the most common among venereal diseases. The treatment of this widespread disease is indeed a difficult one. However, Europe is, after all, the birthplace of science. The treatment of gonorrhea has long exceeded the standard line. All doctors in various countries stipulate that doctors should adopt the latest scientific methods, that is, the "Climino," a mixed preparation of proteome and yellow pigment invented by Dr. Peter, is used as an internal medicine. After trial use, acute gonorrhea can be completely cured in about three or four bottles. Chronic gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, arthritis, etc., can be completely eradicated in a short period of time, and blood tests prove that it has been cured.

According to the experiment of Professor Meitingkov of the University of Paris, he used artificial infection with gonorrhea in apes, and saw that both testicles swelled. Feeding them with other gonorrhea drugs increased the disease. Only by feeding them with "Climino" mixed with food could they be completely cured in about four or five weeks. Therefore, gonorrhea patients competed to buy and take it, and it was very effective. In addition, in order to prevent the spread of gonorrhea in other countries' brothels, prostitutes mostly took large doses of "Climino." They used to have "laundries" set up by the government with many scientific facilities. Those who asked for willows and flowers used medicated water to wash each other beforehand to avoid mutual infection, but since the invention of "Climino," gonorrhea has been drastically reduced, and there is no need to use this troublesome procedure. This is really a major invention in gonorrhea science. It is appropriate for countries to choose healthy conscripts and regular soldiers and meet more standards.

### New Treatment for Prostatitis

Initial Characteristics

The initial characteristic of prostatitis is a deep pain in the front of the anus, frequent urination, and very little urine. When urination is about to end, there is a stabbing pain in the penis. If a finger is inserted into the anus, there is tenderness due to the enlarged prostate, hence this allergic reaction. In this case, the doctor must administer the latest treatments, such as cooling anal suppositories for the prostate, internal medicine "Climino," and injections, so that prostatitis, which is generally avoided by doctors, can be effective. Prostatitis is not only painful and unbearable, but also has endless harm to the future of reproduction. The reason is that the prostate can secrete a kind of liquid, which is called prostatic fluid, which has the element of nurturing sperm. Just like fish and water. Fish cannot survive without water, and sperm cannot reproduce without prostatitis. Therefore, those suffering from gonorrheal prostatitis must pay attention to these places.

Examples of Verified Cases

The following are examples of cases that I have verified. The patient was a male named Lu; because he went to a brothel, he felt pain when urinating on the fourth day, the foreskin was swollen, and purulent liquid flowed from the urethra. He came to me for treatment, shaking his head and frowning, in great pain. The prostate was swollen, the urethra was blocked, and there was a lot of turbid flow when pressed. It was diagnosed as acute urethritis and complicated with prostatitis. So I first used blood serum injection, and used cold compresses and anal suppositories, and at the same time took "Climino," to make it have an anti-gonorrheal phagocytic effect, and German static electricity therapy, so that the inflammatory secretions can be prevented from clogging the urethra, and promote the elimination of inflammation. After about a day of treatment, the inflammation completely subsided, the pain disappeared, and the treatment continued for three weeks. Examination confirmed that it had been completely cured. But if Mr. Lu had not treated it early, it would have become chronic and irreversible. Diagnosis time: 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. Starting from today, 20 patients will be sent for diagnosis every day, and each patient will only be charged 50 cents.

### Pulmonary Disease Requires Early Awareness

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Most patients with pulmonary disease experience a slight cough once or twice, or a severe cough with phlegm, decreased appetite, and listlessness. They wish to gain weight, but instead lose it daily, and thus consumption develops. If effective treatment can be given at this time, a complete cure can be hoped for, and the results are easily achieved. If it is delayed until the second or third stage of serious illness, it cannot be cured without a long period of time. Therefore, those suffering from pulmonary disease should seek early treatment, but finding an effective internal medicine for treating consumption is difficult. This is what I have constantly felt over the past 20 years of clinical practice. However, since Dr. Stoebe in Germany invented "Pulmonary Nale," the solution became clear. The efficacy of "Pulmonary Nale" lies in its ability to eliminate the oxygen necessary for pulmonary disease, thereby depriving the pathogens of their ability to function. It is remarkably effective for symptoms such as hemoptysis, coughing with phlegm, chest pain, night sweats, and fever caused by consumption.

### Trade Commission Stipulates Methods for Collecting Local Products at Ports for Export: First Concentrate in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Zhejiang, Then Transport to Ports; Fuhua and Others Are Responsible for Purchasing

After the Trade Commission unified the transportation and sales of major domestic products to Hong Kong for export, it has now decided that domestic products from various provinces should first be concentrated in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Zhejiang, and then transported to Hong Kong for export. Fuhua Company, the Resources Commission, the Vegetable Oil Company, etc., are responsible for purchasing and transporting the goods. As a result, foreign trade is improving. Details are as follows:

Concentrating Domestic Product Exports in Hong Kong

After the export of major domestic products from the mainland is concentrated in Hong Kong, they will be loaded onto ships and transported to various overseas locations. Products from Sichuan, Yunnan, Kang, etc., will first be concentrated in Kunming, and then transshipped to Haiphong and then to Hong Kong. Products from Guizhou, Guangxi, Hubei, etc., will first be concentrated in Guiyang, then transshipped to Nanning, and then transported to Guangzhou Bay and then to Hong Kong. Products from Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, etc., will first be concentrated in Ningbo or Wenzhou, and then loaded onto ships and transported to Hong Kong. In addition to establishing a branch in Hong Kong to oversee the concentrated export of domestic products, the Trade Commission will also establish offices in Kunming, Guiyang, Nanchang, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places. It is currently planning to establish an office in Haiphong.

Responsible for Purchasing Domestic Products Separately

Regarding the purchase of major domestic products: Tea will be handled by Fuhua Trading Company; Tungsten ore will be handled by the Resources Commission; Tung oil will be handled by the Vegetable Oil Company. Each commission has established offices in Hong Kong to handle the concentrated transportation and sales matters. However, the Trade Commission, based on foreign market prices and the production costs of these goods, will separately determine the purchase prices for the place of origin and the distribution market of each item. However, to maintain merchants' business, the principle is to encourage and assist Chinese and foreign merchants to purchase. If merchants are unwilling to purchase due to high prices, the commission will purchase as much as possible.

Exports Increase Sharply After Unification

The export of major domestic products has been quite effective after being unified. The export volume has increased sharply since the beginning of the war. All goods that were previously for export but cannot currently be transported and sold independently are purchased by the government at a negotiated price. The purchase price is announced every week or ten days in the purchase area, so that collectors and transporters can follow it, making every effort to maintain the livelihood of general small merchants. It is stipulated that the transportation of domestic products is insured for war risk by the Central Trust Bureau, and the insurance premium is allowed to be recorded in the account. If the goods are sold at a loss, the insurance premium is waived. However, merchants who export goods on their own, such as tung oil and tea, are required to settle and sell foreign exchange according to law, but are allowed to be exempt from export duties.

### Foreigners in Kuling Do Not Wish to Withdraw; Establish Neutral Zone

The "China Press" reports that a Japanese military spokesperson told reporters yesterday (the 21st) that foreigners in Kuling will withdraw today (the 22nd). According to news from Jiujiang, they will go down the mountain under the management of British and American naval officers. Some foreigners in Kuling have decided to stay on the mountain. It has been heard that a neutral zone will be established, where foreigners can go when Japanese aircraft carry out bombing of the area.

### Case of Italian Soldiers Shooting and Wounding Workers: Italian Consulate Offers Compensation; Compensation of 200 Yuan

Worker Chen Peiqing, a native of Yixing, was shot and seriously wounded in the leg by Italian troops for no reason at the Xiaoshadu Road Yaoshui Lane entrance on the morning of the 11th of last month. Afterwards, his family reported to the Yixing Native Place Association in Shanghai, requesting assistance and relief. Upon receiving the report, the association sent personnel to investigate the facts and immediately sent letters to the Italian Consulate and the Public Works Department to negotiate. It is now known that Deputy Chief of the Public Works Department He Deqiu and Chinese Director Jiang Yiping came forward to mediate and negotiate, and the Italian Consulate has agreed to give Chen Peiqing a compensation of 200 yuan to settle the case.

### American Nationals in Shanghai Celebrate Washington's Birthday Yesterday; Dance Held the Night Before

The "China Press" reports that American nationals in Shanghai will celebrate Washington's Birthday today (the 22nd). The main event will be that the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, will host some American nationals in Shanghai at the Columbia Country Club. American nationals in this city will all be on holiday today. The U.S. Consulate General and many American commercial organizations will be closed. Although the soldiers of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai will also be on holiday, they have not prepared any special celebrations. The American Club held a Washington's Birthday dance last night (the 21st). Leading figures of the American community in Shanghai, such as Marine Corps Commander Colonel Fagan, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet Admiral Yarnell, and Gauss, all attended.

### Drugs Rampant and Frightening in the Western District of Shanghai; Supplied in Large Quantities by the Japanese Military Special Service Department, the Income from Which is Used to Pay for Military Expenses; Shanghai Has Begun the Path of Degeneration

The "China Press" reports that crime and assassinations are rampant in the Western District of Shanghai. Among them, the most poisonous threat is opium. The Chinese in that area are in danger of complete degeneration. With the permission and assistance of the Japanese authorities, opium is transported to the area to be sold openly in opium dens. Although the Public Works Department has protested and foreign residents outside the Western District concession have also complained, the authorities outside the concession have ignored this and are still rapidly implementing the plan. The situation in that area today can only be described as "frightening." The drug trade is far more serious than other, even the most serious threats. Opium and other drugs can be legally sold in all areas under Japanese control, and Shanghai has also begun the path of degeneration. The authorities collect money from the opium dens and earn huge profits. According to investigations, there were attempts to establish opium dens in the Western District as early as January last year, but these plans were not realized until the end of November. Eleven opium dens were established. The reason for the delay in officially opening opium dens was that the Japanese wanted the opium den owners to first pay a "deposit" of 3,000 yuan per quarter. Although the opium den owners were unable to pay, to this day, there are as many as 34 known opium dens in the Western District, all of which are making huge profits. It is expected that there will be more people who follow to establish opium dens in the future, because both the opium den owners and the Japanese can greatly benefit from this trade. Opium den owners must pay 1,000 yuan per month to the local rulers, but because the amount was too large, it was reduced to 500 yuan before they could operate. This opium is transported in large quantities by the Japanese military special service department from Hongkou to supply the opium dens. In mid-December last year, an Opium Den Association was established on Avenue Petain, and the opium den owners joined the association as members. The association then moved to Jessfield Road. The authorities obtained huge income from the members of the association, which was used to pay for military expenses. Therefore, they refused to hand over the opium dens in the area to the control of the "Reformed Government." In addition to opium dens and gambling dens, a heroin smuggling center was established last month at 477 Route Robert, the corner of Pinglang Road, under the false name of Tai Chang (transliteration) Tobacco Exchange Shop. The operators seem to be three Koreans, and several rogues from the Western District are used as drug dealers. In January of this year, the Japanese authorities established the "Opium Smuggling Prevention Group" in the Jessfield Road area, which was presided over by a Japanese advisor of the "Shanghai Municipal Government." The office was located at 21, Lane 61, Chennault Road. The group was divided into two departments: one dealt with smuggling cases involving Japanese and Koreans, and the other dealt with cases involving Chinese. The group's expenses were naturally paid for by the monthly collections from the opium dens. At the end of last year, a "General Bureau for the Prohibition of Opium" was also established, with its office on the sixth floor of the Broadway Mansions, with the aim of implementing an opium monopoly plan in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The detailed actions of this group are not yet known, but its establishment is intended to collect money to pay for military expenses, which seems to be beyond doubt. At the beginning of August last year, it was decided to establish an "Opium Monopoly Bureau" in West Shanghai, so it was planned to rent three houses at Nos. 6, 7, and 70, Lane 538, Connaught Road, as warehouses for storing Da Jing opium. However, as far as is known, this proposed "Bureau" has not yet started operations.

### Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association Stipulates Measures for Purchasing Raw Cotton in Ningbo; Members Apply for Certificates from the Association to Ensure It Is for Their Own Use and Not for Resale

For the Shanghai Chinese cotton mills to purchase raw materials in Ningbo, after the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, the Cotton Mill Association has now complied with the order and stipulated the following six measures for Shanghai Chinese cotton mills to obtain certificates for purchasing raw cotton in Ningbo: 1. Chinese cotton mills that are members of this association and whose factories are located in the special zone south of the Suzhou River in Shanghai may apply to this association for a certificate for purchasing raw cotton if they go to Ningbo to purchase raw cotton. 2. Those who apply to this association for a certificate must declare that it is for their own factory's use and must not resell it to other factories. 3. Cotton mills that go to Ningbo to purchase cotton must first submit a letter signed by the manager, clearly stating the quantity of raw cotton to be purchased, the purchase period, the entrusted cotton firms, and the number of purchase orders, and send it to this association for review. After approval, a certificate will be issued. 4. After the cotton mill that has been approved to receive the certificate receives notification from this association, it will immediately notify the entrusted cotton firm to bring the signed purchase order to the association to receive the certificate. 5. After obtaining the certificate from this association, they will use the certificate from this association to obtain a certificate from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. 6. After the certified raw cotton is delivered to the factory, the factory should send the original certificate to the association for cancellation.

### British Army West Yorkshire Regiment Sends Out Patrols

The British army stationed in Shanghai has not sent out patrols on the roads for a long time. Because of the repeated terrorist incidents in Shanghai in recent days, the British Army West Yorkshire Regiment reappeared on Nanjing Road on the evening of the 21st, totaling eight people, along with one of the three Sergeants from the Old Zha Police Station, patrolling together.

### Rice from the Place of Origin Can Still Be Transported to Shanghai; Detained Rice Boats Have Been Released; Rice Industry Set to Open Market on Designated Day

The Japanese side had prohibited the transportation and export of rice from various producing areas along the port starting from the 17th of this month, which greatly angered inland rice merchants. After arguing based on reason, the Japanese side, finding it difficult to go against public opinion, still allowed free transportation and sales to Shanghai, but purchases from Shantou and other places were absolutely prohibited. The Shanghai rice market will open tomorrow, and commissions will be unified. Details of the situation are explored and recorded as follows:

Local Resistance to Prohibition of Rice Export

The Japanese side, using its special violence in the occupied areas, not only detained seven rice boats on February 17th of this year, but also suddenly prohibited the export of rice from various producing areas along the river, and even Shanghai was included in the prohibition. At that time, the Shanghai rice industry groups instructed local merchants to conduct detailed investigations in order to plan how to cope with the situation. At the same time, the inland rice merchants were greatly angered by the illegal actions of the Japanese side and jointly protested and negotiated with the Japanese side. As a result, the Japanese side, finding it difficult to go against public reason and humanity, allowed rice from the producing areas to be freely transported and sold to Shanghai, but the rice transported to Shantou and other places was still prohibited. As for the rice transported to Shanghai, the heavy taxes and fees are still being protested by the rice merchants.

Detained Rice Boats Have Been Released

According to news from the rice industry, after seven rice boats anchored at the mouth of the Hupoo River were detained by the Japanese Navy at the end of the lunar year, rice firms such as Xinfeng in this city repeatedly negotiated and have been released. Regarding the three crew members who were killed and injured by Japanese warships firing guns, the firms raised funds to compensate the families and bear the medical expenses to settle the matter.

Rice Market Opens Tomorrow

The rice market in this city, with the end of the general settlement period and the expiration of the holiday, is scheduled to resume opening at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. The sales and splitting of transactions by brokers will be carried out in accordance with the previously set regulations. The original regulations for rice transactions were a commission of 1.2 cents per stone, but due to competition among the industry, it was inconsistent. Therefore, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association reiterated the previous proposal and uniformly charged a commission of 1.2 cents per stone. If anyone is found to arbitrarily reduce the commission, they will be punished immediately.

### Court Order Interprets Trademark Ambiguities; If the Organization of the Company Name is Particularly Distinct and Complies with Regulations, Registration Shall be Approved

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, based on an order from the Executive Yuan and interpreted by the Judicial Yuan, regarding the ambiguity of applying for registration of one's own company name as a trademark, specifically instructed the Trademark Bureau to investigate and follow. The original text is as follows:

Executive Yuan Correspondence: It is doubtful whether it is appropriate to approve the application to register one's own company name as a trademark. There are two opposing views on this matter. A. Those who argue that it should not be approved say, in short, that the so-called "having" another person's company name in Article 2, Paragraph 8 of the Trademark Law clearly refers to the subsidiary part of the trademark. Article 14 of the same law is also a general usage law for trademarks and is not the body of the trademark. Therefore, it cannot be used as a reason to register a company name as a trademark. Furthermore, simply using a company name as a trademark does not have a particularly distinct structure, which also violates the provision in Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law that it "should be particularly distinct." Moreover, according to Article 14 of the same law, registering a company name does not restrict the effect of the exclusive right to use the trademark. In other words, it cannot be used to resist a third party. Therefore, even if registration is approved, it will not obtain exclusive rights and will be meaningless. B. Those who argue that it should be approved say, in short, that Article 2, Paragraph 8 of the Trademark Law stipulates that with the consent of another person, another person's company name can be used as a trademark. Therefore, it is certainly not a problem to use one's own company name as a trademark. Furthermore, using one's own created company name that is not commonly used by the general public as a trademark does not violate the provision in Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law that it "should be particularly distinct." As for Article 14 of the Trademark Law, although there is a provision that "those who express their own name or company name in the manner of ordinary use shall not be restricted by the effect of the exclusive right to use the trademark," this does not prohibit the use of a company name as a trademark, but only restricts the effect of the exclusive right to use the trademark, so that it cannot restrict a third party acting in good faith. The above two views each have their own reasons. The matter concerns the ambiguity in the application of the Trademark Law. It is appropriate to consult your court for investigation and interpretation. As for the grade of public friendship, this consultation is with the Judicial Yuan.

Order from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, according to Instruction No. 9855 Yu Zi from the Executive Yuan on November 28, 27th year of the Republic of China, "Upon investigation, this Yuan previously consulted the Judicial Yuan regarding the ambiguity in the application of the Trademark Law. Now, with the approval of the Judicial Yuan's Yuan Zi No. 1794 correspondence on October 18, 27th year of the Republic of China, 'It has been resolved by the Uniform Interpretation of Laws Conference of this Yuan that if one's own company name is used as a trademark and application for registration is submitted, if the organization of the company name is particularly distinct, it shall be approved for registration as it is consistent with the provisions of Article 1 of the Trademark Law. A corresponding consultation for reply and investigation,' etc., according to this, inform and follow this order."

### Central Government Sends Personnel to Rectify Salvation Work in Guerrilla Areas; Headquarters Established in Qingpu

In order to organize educated youth in guerrilla areas to strengthen the strength of the Second Anti-Japanese War, the Central Headquarters of the Three Principles of the People Youth League has specially dispatched investigators to various places to organize reconstruction and salvation command headquarters nearby, so as to be responsible for promoting the salvation work of various groups and training members. The suburbs of Shanghai are currently under the responsibility of Mr. Xue, an investigator stationed in Shanghai. Xue established the command headquarters in the countryside of Tianmashan, Qingpu on the 10th and is actively proceeding. It is heard that the working principle of the headquarters is to unite revolutionary youth, vigorously practice the Three Principles of the People, defend the country, and restore the nation, and to train members to take on the task of resisting Japan and building the country. There are six training guidelines: 1. Strict discipline; 2. Unified will; 3. United spirit; 4. Concentrated strength; 5. Thorough implementation of orders; 6.

Military training is also strictly implemented, so the steps of salvation work in the counties around Shanghai have gradually become consistent and should be able to inflict a serious blow on the enemy.

### Shooting of Japanese People on Nanjing Road Has No Political Connection; Shooter Was Korean, Motive Was Jealousy; Injured Japanese Dancer's Arm Will Be Disabled

The case of the shooting of three Japanese people on Nanjing Road on the day of the lunar New Year's Day (the 19th) has been proven to have no political connection. The shooter was Korean, and the motive seems to have been jealousy and murder. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 21st), a reporter from a Western newspaper asked a senior official of the Public Concession Police Department about the motive of the case. The official replied that the case indeed had no political connection. According to other sources, the shooter seemed to be Korean. Even the chauffeur of the car hired by the Japanese at the time stated in his confession to the police that he thought the shooter was Japanese or Korean. According to reliable information, the injured person was a dancer who spoke fluent English. Judging from various circumstances, the case must have been out of jealousy by someone who previously loved the dancer. Also, the Japanese military spokesperson mentioned the case of an Oriental person shooting two Japanese army photographers and a Japanese woman on Nanjing Road on Sunday afternoon, saying that the bullet that hit one person's arm was surgically removed by a doctor yesterday after an hour and a half. The bullet was obviously not an ordinary nickel-tipped one, but a specially constructed one that would explode upon contact with the human body. At that time, three large pieces and some fragments were found, but the injured person's arm may be disabled. The injured Japanese woman is not in danger.

### Postal Service Obstructed in War Zones; Situation in Hainan Island Unclear; Wuhan Postal Transport Restricted

Since the outbreak of war in Hainan Island, mail between Shanghai and the island has been clearly obstructed, because no mailbags have arrived in Shanghai recently. Hainan Island has a very large area, with post offices in Haikou, Qiongzhou, and other places. The situation of these post offices since the outbreak of war is very unclear.

Postal Delivery to Haiphong Obstructed

As for southwestern Guangxi Province, which is adjacent to French Annam, mail to that area used to be forwarded through Haiphong. This has also been affected by the war in Hainan Island, and postal delivery has been obstructed. Therefore, no mailbags from that area have arrived in Shanghai recently. As for mail to central Guangxi, after the railway from Jinhua to Guilin was opened, postal deliveries between Shanghai and Guilin have all been routed through Wenzhou.

Haimen Unaffected

As for postal deliveries to Haimen in eastern Zhejiang, although there are no direct sailing vessels between Shanghai and Taizhou after Haimen was bombarded by Japanese warships, everything can be forwarded through Ningbo, so there is no impact. However, parcels that are large in size can all be delivered to eastern Zhejiang, while parcels above Nanchang in Jiangxi Province have been suspended.

Resumption of Postal Service in the Three Towns of Wuhan

Since Hankou fell, postal deliveries between Shanghai and Hankou have been resumed due to the fact that Shi Misi, the director of postal affairs in Hubei District, remained in Hankou. The post offices that have now resumed postal services include Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang. Therefore, mail between Shanghai and these three places has been opened, but transportation is inevitably controlled by one party due to environmental conditions. Therefore, the ships used to transport mail from Shanghai to Hankou or from Hankou to Shanghai are all Japanese merchant ships. Recently, this morning (the 22nd), a batch of mail was sealed and sent from Shanghai, loaded onto the Japanese ship Daixin Maru, and transported to Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang. However, the amount of mail is also very limited.

### French Commercial Counselor Salon to Go to Chongqing First

### Opium Dealer Detained

Yesterday the man from Guangdong, Zheng Jinsheng, was passing the intersection of Avenue Paul Beau and Avenue Foch in the French Concession, when French Police Officer No. 293 saw that his behavior was suspicious. They seized two bags of red earth from his body at the police station. The man said that he lived at No. 8, Lane 452, Xindagu Road, and that the earth was being sent to the home of Zheng Xushi at No. 329, Baokangli. The police chief immediately dispatched Detective Gao Chaozhen to arrest Zheng Xushi. Following that, the police officers from the Public Concession also dispatched detectives to No. 8, Lane 452, Xindagu Road and arrested two men from Guangdong: Zheng Yuntai and Liu Jichao. A box with a mechanism was also seized, containing several taels of opium, as well as scissors and scales. Yesterday, they were all sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting an extension of the investigation period. After questioning by Judge Liao Yuan, it was decided to reschedule the hearing to the 27th. The defendants were taken into custody.

### Extension of Deadline for Imported Goods in Customs Warehouse; Extended to the End of June This Year to Adapt to the Current Business Situation

For the purpose of further extending the deadline for imported goods in customs warehouses, the Jianghai Customs has issued Notice No. 96, "It has been investigated that the ordinary customs warehouse regulations stipulate the time limit for storing imported goods in customs warehouses. Previously, due to the unstable situation, it was approved to extend it to March 31, 28th year of the Republic of China, as stated in Notice No. 92 of this department on September 30th of last year. Now, in order to adapt to the current business situation, all imported goods stored in customs warehouses, in accordance with Article 14 of the said regulations, originally with a limit of twelve months, are now approved to be extended to June 30th of this year. All goods currently stored in customs warehouses that are due to expire before June 30th of this year are still allowed to be stored until that date. Merchants are requested to be universally informed. This notice is hereby given, Deputy Tax Commissioner of the General Affairs Department, Qiu Zhuoqi."

### Change of Director of the Water Conservancy Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; Song Tong Goes to Chongqing to Take Office

The national government's national water conservancy affairs have always been planned and handled by the Water Conservancy Office specially established by the Economic Commission, and two water conservancy associations, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, were established to preside over river water conservancy projects. Later, in order to adjust the political structure, a Water Conservancy Department was specially established under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with Zheng Zhaojing as the director. Recently, Mr. Han Guojun, a gentry from northern Jiangsu, and others telegraphed Mr. Zheng to discuss all matters related to water conservancy in northern Jiangsu. It is now known that Mr. Zheng has recently been appointed to another important position and has already submitted his resignation as the director. It has been learned that Song Tong has been selected and appointed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to succeed Zheng as the director of the Water Conservancy Department. Mr. Song has already gone to Chongqing a few days ago to take office.

### Hometown Associations Distribute Relief Piggy Banks; There are Two Types, A and B, That Can Be Obtained from the Associations

For the purpose of promoting the piggy bank movement, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Hometown Associations Solicitation Committee held a radio broadcasting conference at the Daya Radio Station a few days ago.

### Policemen Attacked in Wujiaochang, Detective Killed by Bullet, Also Killing a Pseudo-Policeman and Wounding a Woman; Police Attach Great Importance to This Case

The Chengdu Road Police Station of the Public Concession received a report the night before last stating that a large number of bandits were hiding in a thatched house with no number at the end of Jessfield Road. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched Western Detective Davis, along with Chinese Detectives Liu Changhong, Zhang Peilan, Wu Junqing, Wang Dianchen, Tian Changchun, and Li Jian, to make arrests. They arrested two men and one woman on the spot and took them back to the police station for interrogation. According to their confession, there were accomplices hiding in another thatched house in the same area. So the detectives went there again but found nothing. After further interrogation, the father confessed that many pawn tickets were hidden in the Yinghua Alley on Robison Road. Thereupon, the original group of detectives, again escorting the original criminals, took a black police car to Yinghua Alley for a third search. When the car arrived there, around 9:40 AM yesterday morning, as they were checking pedestrians in front of the Olympic Theatre (now renamed Fuxing Shaohe Theatre) in Wujiaochang, someone suddenly attacked the police car from the roadside, firing a total of forty to fifty shots. At that time, the Chinese and Western detectives in the car also jumped out of the car, scattered around, and returned fire. Unexpectedly, Chinese Detective Liu Changhong was shot in the face, the bullet entering through the nose and exiting through the back of the head, and he fell to the ground and died on the spot. At the same time, a pseudo-"policeman" numbered 1341, standing by the side of Wujiaochang, was also hit by a stray bullet and died on the spot. Amidst the chaos, the Public Concession Police Department continued to dispatch a large number of detectives and police officers. On the Japanese-puppet side, Japanese military police also went to guard, but the shooters had long since disappeared without a trace. Therefore, there were no results. In addition, a vegetable-buying woman named Tao Baishi, 35 years old, was also grazed on the head by a stray bullet and has been sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Liu's body has been sent to the coroner's office. The body of the pseudo-policeman was taken away by the Japanese-puppet side after the incident. Currently, the police are attaching great importance to this case and are investigating.

### Pseudo-Detective Executed in a Tea House on Singapore Road; Stray Bullet Kills a Four-Year-Old Child; After the Incident, Search Finds the Brave Man Already Escaped

At around 9:30 AM yesterday morning, the "Chinese Youth Anti-Japanese and Punish Traitors Iron Blood Army" was active in the Caojiadu area. At that time, more than a dozen youths, fully armed, gathered next to the Gongda Yarn Factory at No. 60 Singapore Road, and then marched east towards the Malongshun Tea House. Upon reaching the place, one or two youths stepped inside. At that time, Li Hongtao, who used to be a gangster in Zhabei and is now reportedly serving as a

Pseudo-Detective Team

member, was sipping tea. As soon as the youths saw him, they immediately opened fire. The first shot hit Li's head, and he fell to the ground. At the same time, a four-year-old child next to Li was unfortunately killed by a stray bullet. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the youths immediately withdrew. Unexpectedly, a Japanese patrol officer from the police station happened to be passing by and, seeing what had happened, immediately drew his gun and shot at the group of youths, firing a total of

Six Shots

but none of them hit. As a result, all the youths still calmly disappeared into the lane next to the Gongda Yarn Factory. The Italian defense soldiers stationed in the Gongda Yarn Factory, hearing the gunshots, also joined the British defense forces at this time, patrolling and guarding, and immediately cut off traffic around the area, engaging in a search. The Japanese-puppet side also sent Japanese-puppet "police", but the shooters had long since

Disappeared Like a Yellow Crane

and nothing was found. Li's body was taken away by pseudo-officials from the Japanese-puppet side after the incident. However, it was later learned that these youths, when walking out of the lane, had encountered a police patrol car and a mutual shooting occurred, but as a result, they still managed to escape towards Wujiaochang amidst the chaos and none of them were captured.

### Gambling Loss, False Report of Theft, Detective Arrives and Shoots One Person

At 8:45 PM last night, the Public Concession Police suddenly received a report stating that a theft had occurred at No. 26 Beigaoshou Lane, Haining Road. Upon receiving the report, the police chief immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to make arrests. Upon arriving at the scene and knocking on the door to enter, they saw several people gambling. Seeing a large number of detectives arrive, the gamblers scrambled to flee. At that time, a Western police officer mistakenly thought they were bandits and opened fire with his gun, firing two shots. The bullets hit Yongren Zhao Xiaomao (32 years old) in the chest. The bullets did not penetrate, and he immediately fell to the ground injured, bleeding profusely. Later, Chinese police car number 298 sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. His injuries are very serious and his life is in danger. It is said that one person was also gambling there and, having lost dozens of yuan in legal tender, became extremely angry and went outside and called the police station to falsely report that there were bandits robbing the place.

### Failed Elimination of Traitors, Stray Bullet Injures Person

At 10:30 PM the night before last (the 21st), at the intersection of Lujia Road, Fahua East Town, Hongkou, seven or eight members of the Youth Anti-Traitor Corps suddenly opened fire on a traitor named Jia with handguns and Mauser pistols, firing more than thirty shots, all of which missed. It was a dark night, and he managed to escape. At that time, audience members at the Hai'ge Road intersection of Fahua East Town and the Weiyang Theater, hearing the alarm, all scrambled to escape, causing stray bullets to hit Li Qiaoyun, a 17-year-old girl from Yangzhou who lived at No. 177 Fahua East Town, in the Central Barber Shop. The bullet entered from her right rib and exited her back. She is now being treated at the Red Cross. Also, Wang Sixing, a peddler from Zhenjiang, was shot in the right foot, and Liu Kouzi, from Jiangbei, was wounded in the arm. These two are not seriously injured.

### Department Store Owner Issues Bad Checks to Stave Off Debt, Sentenced to Fine

The Yong'an Department Store at No. 4029 Robison Road, Hongkou, wholesale purchased the Western socks it sold from the Zhongyuan Socks Factory on Avenue Paul Beau in the French Concession. By the end of the lunar year of Wuyin, it owed Zhongyuan 1,290 yuan in payment for goods. Jiang Yuxuan, from Jiangyin, who was in charge of the store, had no funds to repay. To stave things off, he issued

Three Promissory Notes

one for 290 yuan, to be exchanged at the Guohua Bank, and the other two for 500 yuan each, to be exchanged at the Shanghai Bank. When Zhou Liuyi, the manager of Zhongyuan, presented the notes for exchange at maturity, he learned that the store had no funds. When he went to Yong'an to negotiate with Jiang, the number of creditors who had gathered unexpectedly reached more than thirty. Jiang Yuxuan, however,

Refused to pay a penny and took the opportunity to flee into No. 9 in the nearby vegetable market lane. Zhou reported this to the Pudu Road Police Station in charge, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Jiang. The next morning (the 18th), he was escorted to the First Special District Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Meng Tingke. After the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case, Zhou Liuyi also turned himself in to clarify the matter. The defendant was charged with

### The Ugly Crowd Leaping and Struggling in Both Ningbo and Shanghai, Competing for the Position of Pseudo-Court President, Unable to Reach Agreement Due to Uneven Distribution of Spoils

After the assassination of Tu Fu (i.e., the defector lawyer Tu Zhenhu), the pseudo-"President of the Nanshi Local Court," the future problem of the pseudo-"court," whether it should continue to exist or be merged with the pseudo-"Judicial Office" in Pudong, and the question of the successor to the pseudo-"President," have all become the focus of contention between the pseudo-organizations of Ningbo and Shanghai over the pseudo-"legal rights" in Shanghai. According to the opinion of the pseudo-"Mayor" Fu Xiao'an, on the pretext of obstruction by the Japanese Navy, the dilapidated pseudo-"court" should be moved from Nanshi to Pudong, and the pseudo-"Judicial Office" in Pudong should be reorganized into a pseudo-"Local Court" to facilitate handling matters. However, Hu Rengtai, the pseudo-"Minister of Justice and Administration of the Maintenance Government," insisted that the pseudo-"court" should still be located in Nanshi, emulating its pre-war status. If the pseudo-"Judicial Office" in Pudong, due to naval relations, is unwilling to be merged into Nanshi, then it should be changed to a pseudo-"Court Branch." On this point of contention, both sides find it difficult to resolve due to the stakes involved. And there are many competitors for the post of pseudo-"President." In Shanghai, there are already three people coveting the position. The pseudo-"Mayor" Fu Xiao'an intends to recommend Fei Guoxi, the pseudo-"Chief of the Criminal Section of the Judicial Office" (also a defector lawyer), while the pseudo-"Secretary-General" Su Xiwentrusted Nanben, the chief of the Japanese Special Service Agency, to recommend Wu Wenzhong, the pseudo-"Director of the Judicial Office" in Pudong. Lu Ying, the pseudo-"Chief of the Police Bureau," has also joined the competition, recommending Peng Bin, the pseudo-"Chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the Judicial Office" (i.e., Peng Bingyan). These three have already found it difficult to elect a candidate, and Hu Rengtai, the pseudo-"Minister of Justice and Administration," is still trying to recommend a private individual. Whose hands will the deer fall into remains to be decided. The pseudo-"court" has effectively come to a standstill. The fact that the Ningbo and Shanghai sides are still unable to reach an agreement over this one small puppet vacancy shows a glimpse of the uneven distribution of spoils and intense secret infighting within the pseudo-organization.

### Fortune Teller Disappears Without a Trace, Wife and Daughter Seduced and Raped, Defendant Acquitted in Court

Xu Li, a 30-year-old woman from Haimen, Jiangsu, residing at No. 18 Jindeli, Avenue du Père Froc, French Concession, retained lawyer Liu Xiang to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Zhao Guofan (residing at No. 83 Dakangli, Avenue Conty) of fraud, seduction, rape, concealing her husband, and plotting to rape her young daughter, requesting investigation of the crimes of fraud and harming the family and morality, etc. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff

married Xu Hanshan in her early years and gave birth to a girl named Guoying, now 14 years old. After the August 13th incident, they fled from their hometown to Shanghai, temporarily residing at No. 10 Taianfang, Avenue du Père Froc. The husband set up a fortune-telling stall outside, and the plaintiff did laundry to make a living. On April 20th last year, she encountered the defendant on the vegetable market road. After talking to each other, the defendant said to the plaintiff, "Your husband's life is hard. Why don't you go to Haimen with me to

Seek a more profitable livelihood?" After deliberation, on the 26th of the same month, the defendant accompanied the plaintiff's husband, Xu Hanshan, to go together. Later, the defendant came again, falsely claiming that her husband had entrusted him to take the plaintiff to live in Haimen and instructed her to buy goods, handing over 250 yuan for the purchase. The plaintiff then took her daughter on the Deyao Wheel to Haimen. The defendant had already rented a house in Shijiazhen, Songjigang, in advance. When asked about her husband's whereabouts, the defendant claimed that he had

Recommended him to be a clerk in the guerrilla team and that he had already left for another place. The plaintiff believed him to be true. Who knew that the defendant had ulterior motives? After the 250 yuan had entered his hands, she was also raped. Later, she came to Shanghai and lived at No. 83 Dakangli. Unexpectedly, on the midnight of September 28th, the defendant took advantage of the plaintiff's sleep to try to rape the young daughter, Guoying. The daughter cried out in alarm and woke up

Enduring this act of violence until now. Her husband is nowhere to be found. She doesn't know where he is being hidden. She requests a strict investigation and that he be punished accordingly, etc. After the court received the lawsuit, Judge Jiang Liquan opened a court session for trial. The defendant retained lawyers Fan Gang and Qian Xingzhong for defense. The court hearing was adjourned for investigation and interrogation. On the day before yesterday, the court was convened again for continued trial. The defendant denied all the facts of the lawsuit. Witnesses were again summoned and questioned in court. Since the case was clear, the court ordered the opening of arguments and then announced the conclusion. The court immediately pronounced its verdict, acquitting the defendant.

The situation of issuing a bad check to stave off the debt and deliberately deceiving was examined from Jiang Yuxuan, who admitted that he owed the money and said that he gave the promissory notes because of a temporary financial turnover problem, etc. The court ruled that Jiang had issued checks without sufficient funds, and it had been clarified after interrogation, so he was sentenced to a fine of 80 yuan. If he was unable to pay, he was allowed to commute the fine to one day of labor service for every two yuan. He should immediately repay the plaintiff 1,290 yuan in legal tender. After providing a shop guarantee that he would be available for summons, he was released from custody.

### Knocking Over the Rice Pot, Wife and Concubine Quarrel, Concubine Commits Suicide by Inhaling Smoke

Cao Tingyu, from Ningbo, over forty years old, is a tenant at No. 255 Jinchunli, Avenue Foch, Hongkou. He is a driver at the Shanghai Electric Power Company. His wife, named Lao Er, is a female inspector at the Xinzha Police Station. They have two sons. Two years ago, Cao took Zhao Fengbao (21 years old), a woman from Changzhou, as a concubine, who also had a daughter, still in swaddling clothes. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Cao was cooking porridge with boiling water when a boy accidentally knocked over the rice pot, scalding his young daughter, who cried loudly. The wife and concubine both favored their children, and a disagreement arose. Cao, hearing the noise at that time, actually helped his beloved concubine and rebuked Lao Er. Unexpectedly, Lao Er was unwilling to show weakness and retorted, almost resorting to violence. Fortunately, the neighbors mediated and the matter was settled. However, Zhao was unusually depressed afterwards and secretly inhaled two yuan of smoke behind people's backs yesterday afternoon. Before long, the poison took effect. After the family discovered it, they hurriedly hired a car and rushed her to Tongren Hospital for treatment. She was still not out of danger until midnight.

### New Warehouse of Ewo Han Company Found with Armaments; Warehouse Previously Occupied by Japanese Army

The new wharf of the American Ewo Han Company in Yangjiadu, Pudong, has not been taken over because the Japanese side refuses to return it. One squadron of the Noduchi Unit of the Third Battalion of the Japanese Naval Landing Force stationed in the warehouse has withdrawn, and the warehouse was directly handed over to the Japanese Nissin Company for management. Workers have been sent to clean it inside for days. Unexpectedly, eighteen Type 38 (i.e., Japanese-style) rifles and dozens of hand grenades were suddenly found near the pier the night before last, causing great shock. They reported it to the local pseudo-"Police Bureau," which informed the Japanese Navy and took away the batch of armaments. Japanese officials are now attaching great importance to this case because it would be difficult for others to enter and hide these armaments. It is feared that they were abandoned privately by war-weary elements in the Japanese army during the withdrawal, which is also unknown. Therefore, Battalion Commander Noduchi Sozuke has thoroughly inspected the logistics section of the team to clarify the truth.

### Refugee Falls and Injured

Zhang Zitao, 25 years old, a refugee from Hubei at No. 330 First Relief Shelter, Fujian Road, worked in the banking industry in his hometown. Subsequently, because of the fall of Hankou, Zhang lost his job and came to Shanghai to seek refuge, having no relatives and no means of making a living. He had to move into the shelter. However, the shelter is heavily guarded, and ordinary refugees are forbidden to go out unless something happens. Unexpectedly, Zhang, on the occasion of this old lunar new year, intended to walk on the road outside to relieve his pent-up feelings. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, he caught sight of the guard, Jiang Ruifu, taking off his uniform and hanging it in the room before going out to wash his hands. Zhang took advantage of this opportunity and flew into the room, put on the uniform, tied himself to the window with a rope, and slowly lowered himself. Unexpectedly, the rope broke, and Zhang lost his footing and fell down, breaking his right leg bone, which was a severe injury. The officer discovered it and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Occupying Houses, Wanted Tenants

The houses in Daxingfang, Datong Road, are the property of Xingji Company. Min Shouheng, the tenant of No. 5 Lane, privately sublet the houses to Zhang Gongting and He Chensheng and owed rent for many months. The owner sued the Civil Court of the First Special Court. At the court hearing, Zhang Gongting and He Chensheng appeared and admitted the facts. A judgment was made ordering them to vacate the premises. Zhang and others were dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed, but the appeal was also rejected. Unexpectedly, Zhang and others were unwilling to accept the judgment and colluded with Zhou Henian, the former assistant of Huizhong Tobacco Company, to forge a fake contract in the name of a British company and forcibly occupy the houses. The owner, Xingji Company, retained lawyer Wang Hengyi to criminally sue Zhou Henian in the First Special District Court. The court has been convened many times, but the case has not been concluded because Zhang Gongting failed to appear in court. The Special Court has now issued an arrest warrant for Zhang Gongting, ordering the Old Gate Police Station to arrest him, and the owner, Xingji Company, has published an arrest warrant in the newspaper. It is said that Zhou Henian has moved the Huizhong Tobacco Company out and summoned unknown people to continue the forcible occupation.

### Fresh Eggs Stockpiled in Ningbo and Wenzhou Allowed to Ship to Shanghai; Proof Measures Applied Afterwards

Many of the fresh eggs in this city are purchased from counties under the jurisdiction of Ningbo and Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang. Since the Customs Bureau ordered the prohibition of transporting goods to Shanghai, eggs are also on the list of prohibitions, resulting in a large number of eggs being stockpiled in Ningbo and Wenzhou. However, eggs are fresh goods and easily rot. After the egg merchants in this city appealed for a lifting of the ban, the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the application of the Chamber of Commerce certification method, and the Customs Bureau released the eggs after inspection. It is said that the eggs stockpiled in Wenzhou have already been released by the Ouhai Customs Bureau and shipped to Shanghai. Those stockpiled in Ningbo have also been certified separately by the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and are being transported to Shanghai one after another.

### Yarn and Cotton Current Yarn Market; Market Opens Today; Grey Market Already Open, Prices Up Five, Six, Seven Yuan

The spot market for cotton yarn will open as usual today after the Spring Festival holiday. According to sources, the grey market for current yarn has already opened. The transaction price for 20-count Double Horse Guangdong yarn is 409 yuan, an increase of 5.5 yuan compared to the final market price last year. Another saying is that the price of other 20-count yarns has also increased by six or seven yuan. This is the grey market situation. The reason is that during these few days of holiday, there has been no change in the war, and our army's position has become more consolidated, people are optimistic, and the market is unanimously bullish. The future is that we must continue to move forward, relying on the extent of actual sales development for arbitration.

### Obstructed Yao Flowers Allowed to Pass

The Ningbo Yao flowers, which were obstructed in eastern Zhejiang, have reached more than 160,000 packages. The authorities initially disallowed export due to the factory's urgent need. However, after strenuous efforts by certain flower merchants and requests from the local Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations to the authorities for inspection and approval, permission for release has now been granted. It is estimated that about 60,000 to 70,000 packages can be shipped to Shanghai, with the first batch of over 10,000 packages expected to arrive tomorrow for customs declaration and import.

### Finance: Silver Prices Weak in London and India

A telegram from London on the 21st reported that American merchants made slight sales while also engaging in some profit-taking, resulting in a stable market. The closing price remained unchanged. There were some sellers at the listed price. Spot silver fell by 0.0625, and forward silver fell by 0.4375. A telegram from New York indicated that silver prices in America remained stagnant. Furthermore, a telegram from Bombay revealed that the Indian silver market was slightly weak, with spot prices down by 6 annas, near-term prices down by 2 annas, and forward prices down by 1 anna.

### Sugar Market: Optimistic Outlook for the New Year Market

Before the complete settlement of national sugar, over 10,000 packages arrived. Due to high acquisition costs, there is a relatively tight supply. It is predicted that the opening price today will rise. Shantou refined white sugar is expected to be around $24.50, top white sugar $23.50, special white sugar $20 to $19.50, Zhiyang $17, Tizhuang green $15.50, Huanggang green $15, Longjiang green $13.50, top Diao green $14.50, top red $15.50, middle red $15, ordinary $14.50, special high $16, and Hainan red $13.50 to $13. Foreign sugar is also expected to increase slightly, with Taikoo granulated white B mark calling for an increase of 5 jiao. Coarse white and Dutch red also have the potential to rise. However, according to industry insiders, this spring season sales may not be exceptionally strong, and the situation in eastern Zhejiang is tight, which may hinder sales. Therefore, raising sugar prices too high is not advisable. Furthermore, Japanese sugar products are being produced in Shanghai, which will inevitably have a considerable impact in the future.

### Last Season's Sugar Industry: Profitability Still Good

Last season's sugar industry, due to the extraordinary times and excessive market price fluctuations, experienced unstable ups and downs, making business more difficult. However, special circumstances sometimes led to profits. Therefore, the overall result was still good. Larger businesses still had profits of over $100,000 to $50,000 or $60,000, while smaller ones ranged from over $10,000 to several thousand. Very few incurred losses. Three new organizations were established this season: Dachang, Hengyuan, and Yintai. The profits of the previous season are listed below in thousands of dollars:

### Imports and Exports: Large Shipment of Italian Artificial Silk Arrives

Dutch Sugar and Beeswax Also Imported

During this Lunar New Year, when most businesses are still on holiday, both northern and southern imports and exports are limited. In Jiangbei, downstream of the Yangtze River, only pork and fresh eggs have been transported. Other goods are completely absent. It is reported that a large shipment of local paper will arrive from Ningbo today. As for the Yong Sheng vessel, which is carrying a large shipment of cotton, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, it is now expected to enter the port today. Furthermore, yesterday, the Italian vessel "Con Te Pio Ardo" (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai, carrying a large shipment of 4,800 boxes of artificial silk from Italy, marking the largest import of artificial silk since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Additionally, on Lunar New Year's Eve (the 18th), the Dutch vessel imported 12,500 packages of granulated sugar, 12,300 packages of beeswax, and 2,260 packages of tapioca starch. It also brought 240 boxes of coffee and 48 items of pepper from Southeast Asia, along with 820 boxes of bark. Finally, it transferred 6,570 pieces of nickel, 418 boxes of glass, and 180 tons of paper from Europe via Hong Kong.

### Paper: Tin Foil Decides to Increase Prices at the Start of the Year

The consumption of tin foil last year was unprecedented in Shanghai. This is due not only to the sharp increase in the city's population but also to its role as a distribution center for purchases from other areas. Winter sales were even stronger, and although the supply from production areas was continuous, it was still insufficient. The production areas in Hangzhou and Shaoxing are close to the war zones, and houses have been bombed, causing workers to disperse. Therefore, labor costs are high, and large-scale production remains difficult. As a result, the industry decided at the end of the Lunar Year that the price of a whole pack would increase by 2 jiao per pack, and the retail price would increase by 2 fen per sheet at the start of the year. If production costs fluctuate, a further price adjustment will be discussed around the 25th or 26th, it is said.

### The Future of the Felt Hat Industry

The felt hat industry has only been around for just over ten years in China. Although felt hats became a necessity in society more than ten years ago, there were virtually no Chinese entrepreneurs engaged in the felt hat industry at that time. Therefore, all the felt hats popular in the market were imported goods. Companies like Yixing Baoke and Lulin Meizuishi, owned by Italian merchants, imported a considerable number of felt hats each year.

It was not until the teens of the Republic that Chinese entrepreneurs began to establish hat factories. The first was the Hua Fu Hat Factory. When the factory was established, due to the complexity of hat manufacturing and a lack of experience, it could only manufacture and sell felt hats from hat bodies (note). Later, due to the good quality of the products, the patriotism of the Chinese people, and the lower prices, they were widely purchased. As a result, foreign goods gradually began to lose ground in the Chinese market. The factory then further studied the manufacturing of hat bodies, and in a few years, it succeeded in manufacturing hat bodies from wool, and then making felt hats from the hat bodies, without relying on foreigners.

After several years of hard work by the factory, the number of hat factories established by Chinese entrepreneurs gradually increased. In Shanghai alone, there were more than twenty before the war, such as Hua Fu, Zhonghua, Hua Yu, Hua Sheng, Xu Weiji, Zhongyang, and Lihua. Unfortunately, apart from Hua Fu, Hua Sheng, and Lihua, the other factories could only use hat bodies to make felt hats. Although Hua Fu and the other two factories could make hat bodies, they were insufficient to meet the demand from their competitors. Therefore, hat bodies still had to be imported. In recent years, the quantity of domestic products has been increasing day by day, and the quality can also compete with imported products. As a result, foreign felt hats have almost disappeared from the Chinese market. Unexpectedly, the artillery fire of August 13th destroyed many of the hat factories in Shanghai. Most of the factories were located in Hongkou and the Nanshi district. As a result, when the war started, the factory sites became war zones. Only three or so factories, such as Zhonghua and Huaxing, were located in the concession areas. When the demand for felt hats surged last September and October, due to the large-scale purchases by various merchant groups, the inventory was almost exhausted. On the one hand, there was a shortage of products, and supply could not meet demand. At that time, the manufacturers realized that if there were no large quantities of felt hats produced, the entire felt hat industry would be on the verge of collapse. Some manufacturers then tried to resume business. Although it was easy to resume work, hat bodies were difficult to obtain. In desperation, it happened that Mitsui & Co., a Japanese company, had a large stock of hat bodies, about 100,000 dozen. The manufacturers, in their dilemma, could only purchase from them. In a few months, such a large quantity was almost exhausted, and millions of yuan in legal tender fell into the hands of the Japanese. Therefore, what was nominally a domestic product was actually a Japanese product.

The past of the felt hat industry has been described above, and the future trend is very concerning. If the biggest problem of hat bodies cannot be solved, the felt hat industry, which has been painstakingly built up over the past ten years, will gradually move towards destruction. There is no shortage of enlightened industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai. They should quickly establish pure hat body factories or large-scale hat factories in the interior or Shanghai to alleviate the current emergency. (Zhang Yumei)

(Note) Hat bodies are made from wool or rabbit fur. Because the manufacturing method is complicated and difficult, most factories use hat bodies to make hats.

### Changes in Shanghai's Industry and Commerce Over the Past Year

— Hui

(Continued from the 13th) (2) Reopening of Businesses

Thirty-four industrial plants and commercial firms, having suspended operations due to various reasons, soon reopened, including ten factories and twenty-four commercial firms. Among these reopenings, the most significant was the republication of the Shen Bao, a leading newspaper in China with a vital mission. Although now published by the American Columbia Company, it maintains its consistent, unwavering spirit and has become even more proactive. The distribution of these thirty-four reopened businesses by industrial and commercial sector is as follows: Clothing and food industries each had six firms, cultural and electrical/metal industries each had five, and construction, medicine, finance, entertainment, and daily necessities industries each had two. The travel and decoration industries each had one firm. Comparing the number of reopenings by month, March had the highest with eight firms, followed by January, February, May, and September with four firms each, then October with three, and April, June, and December with two firms each. July had the fewest with only one. August and November saw no reopenings. The breakdown of reopened businesses by sector and month is listed in the table below.

Miscellaneous: Total Exports and Remaining Stock from Yantai

According to correspondence from Yantai, a large number of northern goods and miscellaneous grains, seafood, medicinal materials, and sundries were shipped to Guangdong, Fujian, Hong Kong, and Shanghai in the 27th year. Here are the total amounts and categories of goods remaining in stock at the end of the year, as determined by a classified survey:

### "Laboring Without Merit"

— Mao Lie

Yesterday, the Manchester Guardian's commentary on the Sino-Japanese War can be said to be insightful and exceptionally accurate. It stated that although the Japanese army had some victories in the first phase of the war, in reality, it was "laboring without merit" because their "soldiers are all exhausted and frustrated, and the officers are confused and at a loss." It also said that "guerrilla warfare will continue to spread, and the Japanese will be unable to stop it." Therefore, it predicted that the Japanese army would seek peace after a year.

However, we must add some supplementary opinions to the newspaper's statement that Chinese soldiers are comparable to Japanese soldiers, but Chinese officers are inferior to Japanese officers. We all know that "it is easy to find a thousand soldiers, but difficult to find one general." Officers are inherently more difficult to cultivate than soldiers. In the past, we did not intend to invade others, and because of our internal strife, the cultivation of officers with modern knowledge was insufficient, which is undeniable. Some foreign military observers even said that among the senior Chinese officers, only Hu Zongnan, Tang Enbo, Xue Yue, and Sun Lianzhong were qualified to serve as division commanders. Although this view may be too high and lack practical value, it provides further evidence that Chinese officers are not as satisfactory as desired. However, in addition to accelerating the cultivation of officers with modern knowledge, we have other means to compensate for this deficiency: first, we should use guerrilla warfare; second, we should use protracted warfare.

Guerrilla warfare is a net from which no one can escape. No matter how superior the military knowledge of the Japanese officers may be, they will only be "confused and at a loss," not knowing what to do. Protracted warfare is a long-term attrition. No matter what amazing knowledge the Japanese officers may possess, under the judgment of time, their skills will become completely ineffective. In addition, the depletion of their talent will decrease daily, while the cultivation of our talent will increase daily. The talent on both sides will soon have a reasonable ratio, which is an inevitable trend, and our surpassing them is exactly what we expect. Therefore, I believe that our current deficiency in this area is not to be feared.

The Manchester Guardian probably anticipated this point, which is why it made an optimistic prediction for the Chinese side, even though it pointed out this deficiency on the Chinese side. Because the Japanese are excellent in their battlefield strategy, our battlefield tactics of guerrilla warfare and protracted warfare can negate everything and make them pale in comparison. This is a universally recognized fact.

In the first phase of the war, the Japanese were "laboring without merit." I think that just being "without merit" is their good fortune. After this, I can assert that as long as we firmly resist according to the established policy, they will not only be "without merit" but will also "have demerits." Let's wait and see!

### Li Guang Was Known as the Flying General

— Zou Xiao

——Folk Tales

In the "Yuchuang Qizhen Ji" discovered by the late Ma Lian a few years ago, there is a story called "Li Guang Was Known as the Flying General," which is almost entirely based on Volume 109 of the Records of the Grand Historian, "The Biography of General Li," and Volume 54 of the Former Han Book, "The Biography of Li Guang and Su Jian." It is indeed a very good tragic story. Li Guang defended against the Xiongnu, but he was unlucky and repeatedly failed to achieve merit. Even when he did achieve merit, it could only be used to offset his faults. He followed Zhou Yafu to quell the Wu and Chu rebellions, but because he did not properly bear the general's seal, he did not receive a reward. He defeated the Xiongnu at Shaxi, but because a watching eunuch was shot and killed by the Xiongnu, it was considered his fault, and his merits could only offset his faults. He attacked the Xiongnu at Yanmen, but he was captured by the Xiongnu. Although he escaped, he was demoted to a commoner by the court. All of the above are found in the Han history books.

In order to emphasize the tragic nature of the story, the novel added two more twists and turns to Li Guang's life. Li Guang was humiliated by the governor of Junling, who detained him while traveling at night. When he was reinstated, he executed the governor of Junling. The Han history books say that he executed the governor first and then reported it to the emperor, who praised him and recorded the original text of the imperial edict. However, the novel says that Li Guang defeated the Xiongnu, and "the emperor wanted to promote him, but the family of the governor of Junling went to the palace to accuse Guang of taking revenge for personal grievances. The emperor was angry, used his merits to offset his faults, and made him a commoner again." This is the first twist. The Han history books only say, "Guang's army was defeated and lost its reward." This means that Li Guang "was defeated by the enemy, but he was also able to defeat the enemy, so his merits and faults were equal." But the novel says that he "rode in the car of the Left Worthy King, intending to be unkind, and was brought to trial by the court." As a result, Zhang Qian pleaded for him, and again, "his merits were used to offset his faults, and he was demoted to a commoner." This is the second twist.

Finally, there is the event mentioned in the historical records, where Li Guang followed Wei Qing and Huo Qubing to attack the Xiongnu, but he got lost and missed his appointment, and he committed suicide.

The official histories mention four instances of "bad luck," while the novel adds two more, making it six. This reminds me of the Romance of Xue Rengui's Eastern Expedition, where Xue Rengui's merits were taken by Zhang Shigui, and he was reduced to being a cook. This is also a tragic story, which makes the readers feel indignant, aggrieved, and more sympathetic. I am also reminded of Yu Dayou, who repeatedly defeated Japanese pirates, but Zhao Wenhua stole his credit and even wanted to bring him to trial. The most famous example is Yue Fei, who was killed by Qin Hui at Fengbo Pavilion.

However, we do not need this kind of tragic story now, because we are now in an era of political clarity and strict military discipline, where rewards and punishments are clearly defined. Just look at the executions of Han Fuju and Wang Yizhe, the expulsion of Wang Jingwei from the party, and the commemorations of Yan Haiwen and Yao Ziqing, etc. You can see that the whole country is united and jointly resisting humiliation. The injustices suffered by Li Guang, Yue Fei, and Yu Dayou will not be seen in this world again. Therefore, when we use historical materials to write long novels or Peking opera, we should adopt positive themes, such as "Blood on the Riverbank." Tian Han has also expressed the same opinion in "The War of Resistance and Drama" and has made the same statement at the Shanghai National Salvation Drama Symposium.

### The Development of Satirical Art in Japan

— Bai Ying

From the perspective of human cultural history, the expression of human nature in the arts undoubtedly manifests first in music and painting. Before the advent of the Stone Age and Bronze Age in the visual arts, even among barbarians there existed the most basic music and the most rudimentary painting. This is an undeniable fact, as evidenced by general human history or archaeological history.

What distinguishes humans from other animals, according to the materialistic economic perspective, is the ability to manufacture and use production tools. This view is entirely correct. However, on a phenomenal level, the most prominent difference between humans and other animals is that humans possess something called "culture," which is a synthesis of material and spiritual aspects of human life.

All animals have emotions, but the expression of emotions in animals other than humans cannot deviate from their physiological conditions. For example, horses nuzzling and dogs licking each other can be said to be expressions of their emotions. However, humans, in addition to this physiological expression of emotions, can also use external objects to express emotions that cannot be directly explained by physiology. We believe that the genesis of all art lies in this.

This art, a crystallization of matter and spirit, is like the fire stolen from the gods and brought to mankind by Prometheus. Once this fire arrives among humans, it never goes out. Even during the alternating periods of savagery and darkness in human history, art has always developed along a curved line. The emergence of satirical art lies in the arc-shaped stage of this curved development.

For example, take the current situation in Japan. Under the tyrannical rule of the military, all cultural movements in Japan can be said to have come to a standstill. Cultural movements are tributaries to the pursuit of justice, and justice is incompatible with Japan's "national policy" today. All those engaged in legitimate cultural activities are either tortured and killed or imprisoned. As a result, there is even a strange phenomenon of a shortage of university professors. Those they call "rear-echelon literati" are, at best, hangers-on; in reality, they are nothing more than a pack of lackeys for the warlords. This is not malicious slander; their "writings" are ironclad proof.

But precisely because the fire of Prometheus has been brought to mankind, even if the flames are temporarily extinguished, the embers cannot be extinguished. Therefore, although the fascist military has exerted great pressure on various fields of cultural activity, works such as Tatsuzo Ishikawa's "The Living Soldiers" have emerged in Japanese literature. Although Tatsuzo Ishikawa has expressed "repentance" (as exemplified by "The Battle of Wuhan" in the January issue of "Chuo Koron"), the activities of folk satirical art are very active. In particular, cartoons targeting the so-called "National Mobilization Movement" have managed to escape the attention of censors and have been published in the most popular Japanese newspapers and magazines. Looking at the titles of some of these cartoons, we can sense how full of satire they are. For example, on the theme of "saving" (which has a different meaning from the frugality promoted in China), there are "Lighter Alliance," "Smoking Group," and "Garbage National Army." On the theme of substitutes, there are "Substitute Legislators" and "Fingernail Pens." On the theme of civilian economic mobilization, there are "Wardrobe Reorganization," "Three Memorial Days," "Implementing Family Examples," and "Time Consumption Tax." (Regarding the original drawings, see the reproduced versions in "Magazine" Volume 3, Issues 5 and 6—the latter published on the 16th).

Although the military fascist machine guns are planted all over Japanese soil, this satirical art is a vine sprouting in the midst of the gun forest. Although their initial strength is extremely weak, once they spread and grow, they will surround the gun forest and eventually trip it over, clearing a path for the growth and development of just cultural movements.

News reports indicate that Joseph Goebbels in Germany has noticed that satirical art will jeopardize the existence of fascism, so he has decided to eradicate it. But we firmly believe that the power of Mephistopheles is ultimately incapable of extinguishing the torch of Prometheus. The result will inevitably be like moths flying into the fire, hastening their own demise.

### Ode to Destruction

— Chen Bingwen

Destroy them, Xianmian Hall;

Destroy them, the Auditorium;

Destroy them,

The towering Dragon Gate Building!

In the past, I praised you:

Praised your solemnity,

Praised your tranquility!

I hoped that you would exist forever,

Standing eternally in Wujia Lane.

Now, I praise your destruction,

I want to praise your transformation into scorched earth,

Because I do not want you to be trampled on by the enemy!

I hope that when victory comes,

We can rebuild on the scorched earth:

Rebuild the magnificent Xianmian Hall,

Rebuild the solemn Auditorium,

Rebuild the towering Dragon Gate Building.

"Sir, this number cannot be calculated to find the 'sum,' so we can only find the 'compared' value."

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

"Fellow elders, uncles, brothers, sisters, I am now reporting to you some very unfortunate news. Recently, there has been a significant change in the war situation... Our unit, because we are defending our land and resisting the enemy, are unwilling to retreat, so we have lost contact with the rear and become an isolated force. Now, there are still more than a thousand of us in this regiment. We are not all stationed here; most of our supplies depend on local support, which is very regrettable. However, thinking of you, by paying a small amount of money, we can prevent bandits from taking advantage of the opportunity to steal, and you can continue to live and work in peace, which seems very worthwhile. I will strictly restrain my subordinates and not allow them to disturb you, and I will do my best to help you, so as to achieve a close relationship between the army and the people."

Everyone listened to Regiment Commander Ye's words and expressed a welcoming attitude. Chen, the town leader, was the first to speak, expressing his agreement.

Seeing this, Regiment Commander Ye discussed the matter with Town Leader Chen and the local notables and gentry. As a result, it was decided that the Chamber of Commerce would bear 60% of the supplies, and the people would bear 40%. As for the stationed locations, in addition to public temples and ancestral halls, the major households would voluntarily offer their forward houses. Regiment Commander Ye did the same at his own home.

Everything was negotiated, and Regiment Commander Ye then ordered the troops to enter the town. The people had already known about it in advance, so they were not alarmed at all. Some even set off firecrackers. The soldiers, in their orderly and solemn formation, passed through the streets amidst the sound of firecrackers. Although they had been through a long battle, their morale was still very high.

This was truly a new era in Heping Town, because this place was not a strategic location, so it had never been garrisoned by so many troops. At first, there was inevitably some distance between the people and the soldiers, but later they became like a family, and their feelings became closer day by day.

Regiment Commander Ye did not neglect military arrangements for a moment. His headquarters was set up in the township office. When the battalion that was covering the front line was gradually withdrawn, he reorganized the troops according to the actual needs, dividing them into six guerrilla detachments, each detachment with three companies. The detachment commanders were himself, Deputy Regiment Commander Liang, Staff Officer Zhu, and the other three battalion commanders. The company commanders were successively promoted from company and platoon leaders. Two detachments and one company were left in the town, and the rest were deployed in nearby villages and towns. Sentries were posted near the railway and highway lines. In order to prevent the enemy from attacking from the rear, he also controlled all the boats along the lake, prohibiting all civilian ships from sailing out and only allowing fishing boats to fish and purchase supplies in the vicinity.

In addition to this, Regiment Commander Ye started a political training class in the unit, which was run by his younger brother, Fang Ying, and several local educated youths. The first step was to awaken the people, using words, pictures, and dramas to spread propaganda in the town and nearby villages. At the same time, he moved the original military medical office to a larger location and established a rescue squad. His younger sister, Fang Hui, and doctor Jin Chunan, were recruited to participate in the rescue work. However, the source of medicine was very scarce. Although there was cotton, there was very little absorbent cotton and gauze, which was really unavoidable.

The arrival of the army did not affect the daily lives of the people in the town, but what worried them most was that the harvested rice could not be sold at all and had to be left at home. Regiment Commander Ye thought this was very reasonable, and he repeatedly explained the importance of storing grain to everyone.

Town Leader Chen was very impressed with Regiment Commander Ye's arrangements and often praised Regiment Commander Ye in front of his family, saying how handsome and promising he was. He wanted to marry his daughter, Xiuyue, to Regiment Commander Ye, but he did not want to speak up himself. He asked Mr. Yang, the leader of the local council, to inquire about Regiment Commander Ye's father's opinion. Regiment Commander Ye's father seemed to be very supportive, but Regiment Commander Ye refused outright. The reason was simple, only eight words: "The Huns have not been destroyed, how can I have a family!" (18)

### The Ordeal of Xin Yanqiu

— Yu Yu

Yesterday, this newspaper published a news item titled "Xin Yanqiu Sacrifices for the Nation," sourced from a Reuters dispatch from Beiping on the 20th, stating that several weeks ago, an assassination attempt on Mu Bin at the Jixiang Theater failed, resulting in the on-the-spot death of one Guan Zhenglin. Xin Yanqiu was then arrested by Japanese military police and died in prison. The original dispatch was brief and lacked details. Xin Yanqiu, a frail woman, was able to perform such a heroic act, her will is truly commendable. Ten days ago, a friend of this reporter returned to Shanghai from Beiping to spend the New Year. He spoke to me about this matter, which differed slightly from the Reuters report. Now, following Mr. Xu Muyun, I record it to inform those concerned about the Xin Yanqiu incident.

Feng Zhi'an Goes South, The Actress Stays in Beiping Temporarily

A month before the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, the actress Xin formally married Feng Zhi'an, a subordinate of Song Zheyuan. Song and Feng were both famous anti-Japanese generals. When Pingjin fell one after the other, Feng, finding it inconvenient to bring his family, entrusted Xin Yanqiu and her entire family to Jiang Chaozong for care. He then went south alone to continue his work against the enemy. Subsequently, Jiang Chaozong became the "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" of Beiping, interacting frequently with the Japanese. Xin Yanqiu was also coveted by a certain high-ranking Japanese officer, who wanted to marry her. Jiang dissuaded him, and it did not happen. Afterward, Xin lived in seclusion and did not perform on stage. In between, the Japanese side repeatedly invited Xin Yanqiu to perform in "Manchukuo," but Jiang dissuaded her each time. However, the certain high-ranking Japanese officer was quite resentful about his failed attempt to marry Xin Yanqiu.

Assassination of Mu Bin Fails, The Actress Unluckily Imprisoned

On the sixth of this month, there was a grand charity performance in Beiping. People in the Peking opera world, compelled by circumstances, had no choice but to participate. Tickets were also sold by the performers. The performance was held at the Jixiang Theater. Xin Yanqiu and Li Hongchun performed the main act, the play being "The Entire Diao Chan." Unexpectedly, before the Diao Chan play began, gunshots suddenly rang out from the orchestra seats, an assassination attempt occurred. Only one person died (presumably Guan Zhenglin as reported by Reuters). The person next to the deceased was Mu Bin, an important figure in the "Provisional Government." A ticket was found on the deceased's body. Checking its number, it was sold by Xin Yanqiu. Mu Bin also fled the theater immediately. At this time, the theater was in a state of chaos. After a while, Diao Chan took the stage, but three or four tenths of the audience had already left. When the play ended, Xin was captured by Japanese military police before she could remove her costume.

Yanqiu Rescued from the Cage, But Already Covered in Wounds

The next day, Jiang Chaozong interceded with the high-ranking Japanese officer, requesting the release of Xin Yanqiu. At the same time, the Japanese sent people to search Xin Yanqiu's residence (i.e., Jiang Chaozong's home), where they found a letter sent by Feng Zhi'an from ×× on January 22nd. Fortunately, it only contained greetings and did not raise suspicion. Eventually, Jiang Chaozong, with the guarantee of certain two institutions and thirteen well-known Beiping shops, managed to rescue Xin Yanqiu from the cage, but she was already covered in wounds. According to reports, after arriving at the Military Police Headquarters, she was stripped of her clothing, left naked, and whipped. She had almost no words to defend herself. After Xin Yanqiu returned to the Jiang residence, she was so angry that she wanted to die by taking poison, but Jiang's concubine, Xiao Jinhua, stopped her. At the same time, Mu Bin also came to the Jiang residence to express his condolences. Xin glared at Mu and immediately fainted, then she was taken to Xiehe Hospital.

The Ordeal Has Three Causes, Not Death in Prison

Looking at what my friend described, we can know that Xin Yanqiu suffered this strange humiliation for three reasons: first, she refused to perform in "Manchukuo"; second, she rejected the marriage proposal of a certain high-ranking Japanese officer; third, Mu Bin also had designs on Yanqiu (it is rumored that Xin Yanqiu was Mu's mistress, the origin of which probably lies here). As for Feng Zhi'an's letter, it was just an extraneous detail. As for the Reuters report that Xin Yanqiu had died in prison, it can be proven inaccurate, because my friend left Beiping at the time Yanqiu returned to the Jiang residence. Even if Yanqiu has passed away, she did not die in prison, but definitely in Xiehe Hospital.

Xin Yanqiu is the adopted daughter of my teacher Linwu Shanren. Every time she came south, she was closest to me and Brother Chen Dieyi. Mr. Cao Jingtao, the owner of Kan Yun Lou, supported her greatly and even arranged a marriage in Siam, but it did not materialize. Jingtao will be more heartbroken upon hearing this news than me and Dieyi. I will only offer a sincere prayer, hoping that the Reuters dispatch is inaccurate.

### The Performance of the New Type of Dance Drama "Poppy" is Very Exciting

— Shi De

The "Shanghai Drama Arts Society" performed three one-act plays during this Spring Festival: "Rosalie," "The Mute Wife," and a new type of dance drama "Poppy." The first two are French plays, satires on the general "gentlemanly demeanor" and people who "cut off their nose to spite their face." Because I arrived too late, I did not see them completely, so I will only talk about the last play here.

"Poppy" is an original work by Wu Xiaobang, composed by Chen Genian, and sponsored by the Sino-French Drama Arts School. I am an amateur in both music and dance. Whether the existence of a dance drama on the Chinese stage this time is a creation, please forgive my ignorance, I have no way to "verify." However, I have seen Wu Xiaobang's solo dances several times. From a layman's point of view, dance focuses on the performance of strength. His "Puppet" is still deeply imprinted on my mind. And "Poppy" even more shows the strength of collective power, not to be insulted!

After the fall of Shanghai, the suburbs of Shanghai were almost completely shrouded in the atmosphere of poison. This poisoning policy is part of the enemy's entire conspiracy. On our beautiful land, "windy evenings and rainy mornings, hoping endlessly, enduring hard work, loving freedom, relying on peace, relying on harvest, having no worries about food and clothing for thousands of years," they pulled out "the seeds of wheat, rice, sorghum, and soybeans that we sowed." Implementing the sowing of poisons. In our memory, the "floating corpse case" in Tianjin will never be easily faded! And now they are spreading the sugar-coated policy of "new order" and "revival association." But, "we should not be afraid of hard work and torment, we must cheer up even without sleep." These twenty months of bloodshed are enough to shatter the enemy's illusions. This is the power of the collective! The light of freedom will soon shine on the earth, celebrating our victory around the withered poppy!

Mr. Wu Xiaobang was able to create this "Poppy" dance drama for us, aimed at this problem. This is truly good news during the Spring Festival. As for how the performance was, because I am a layman, I can only say a few layman's words.

"Poppy" is divided into five scenes. The first scene, "Sweating and Wet Backs, We Till the Soil," and the fifth scene, "For the Love and Life, Sow the Flowers and Fruits of Love," may have been rehearsed too hastily, and I felt that the dance steps and music could not be closely coordinated. It was okay when expressing happiness in the first scene, but the fifth scene was not enough to show the power of majesty and beauty. The third scene, "Love Lives Forever in the World," should be the most outstanding scene. Both the music and dance steps can express the spirit of "Love is boiling in our hearts, we appear to sacrifice for love." In the second scene, the lovers and operators, I seem to have seen the shadow of "Puppet" again, but the impression is still not strong enough. The movements of the three characters, Poppy, her brother, and the accomplices, are relatively simple, and they are quite able to portray the collusion of the three-in-one of "ink shirt," "[missing character]" and "making eyes right and left."

Although the rehearsal time was too hasty this time, it is already gratifying that the Sino-French Drama Arts School, which was established not long ago, can have such achievements. I hope they continue to work hard, and we sincerely await the second performance.

### A Conversation with Mr. Li Zhihua About "The Hegemon-King of Chu"

— (Wang Cilong)

After reading Mr. Li Zhihua's "The Hegemon-King of Chu" masterpiece, which was revealed in the newspaper yesterday, I studied it very carefully and felt that Mr. Li's feelings were very touching. However, Mr. Li may have been confused by a momentary impulse and did not analyze the skills of "The Hegemon-King of Chu" in detail, resulting in several paragraphs that were almost neurotic. Because Mr. Li specifically mentioned a few words I wrote in "Yihua Pictorial," I cannot but take the time to talk to Mr. Li and correct a few of Mr. Li's mistakes at the same time.

The problem is that Mr. Li broke apart my two sentences "advocating war, exhausting the army and using force, advocating peace, benevolence, righteousness, and peace" and put them into another topic to make a grand argument. Mr. Li already knows that "the benevolent prosper, and the hegemon perishes." This is an unchanging truth. Then, from a new perspective, anyone can understand the Hegemon-King's indiscriminate killing of innocents. Mr. Li cannot even shoulder this point of publicizing obligation, and he has to forcibly bring in Yue Fei and Qin Hui to show off his words. Mr. Li should have a clear understanding of history before writing. The Hegemon-King belonged to Western Chu, advocating war, exhausting the army and using force, while Liu Bang belonged to the Great Han, advocating peace, benevolence, righteousness, and peace. This is a struggle between countries, and it cannot be compared with Yue Fei and Qin Hui. You should know that Yue Fei and Qin Hui were figures of the same dynasty, which is extremely inconsistent with the national disputes between Xiang Yu and Liu Bang. Benevolence, righteousness, and peace are the virtues of our China for thousands of years. Further speaking to the present, it is definitely not just a "war" character written by Mr. Li. There is also a "resistance" character above the "war" character. Otherwise, we will not only lose the virtues of our ancestors, but also lose the deep sympathy given by friendly countries, and we will also pay it to the vast ocean. Mr. Li does not write with a correct perspective, but only with his own views - wrong views - to add comments, but instead creates himself as the tail of the invaders, which is very dangerous!

Fortunately, there is such a thing as the Chu-Han Contention in history, and fortunately, when I directed it, I completely based it on the Western Han Dynasty without any changes. Otherwise, not only would I be laughed at by Mr. Li as adding snakes' feet, but I would also be accused of harming the country by Mr. Li. Wouldn't this be a wrong, and adding to the crime, there are no words of sadness, but I always believe that Mr. Li is a loyal heart and not intentional. Otherwise, I can take a break from this. Really, there are too many wrong things this year!

### Miscellaneous Records of the New Year's Opera Gathering

— (Chou Cheng)

The Opera Research Association, because the 19th of this month is the Lunar New Year's Day, which is also a Sunday, a rare good festival, announced to its members in advance that it would hold the third issue of the opera gathering. In order to increase interest, it was stipulated that the plays sung by each member on that day must not be the roles they usually sang. For example, those who usually sang female roles must change to singing male or clown roles, and those who usually sang old male roles must change to singing female or young male roles, as if they were cross-dressing. I went there at 4 pm. Zhou Wentong and his wife, Ms. Xu Huizhu, were singing "Xiao Yan." Zhou played Emperor Tang Ming, and Xu played Yang Guifei. Their voices were loud and their pronunciation was accurate. The happiness of the couple was better than painting eyebrows. No wonder Zhou Bangjun's wife was listening attentively beside them, smiling. Then, the master of Letian and the master of Hongdouguan, with their burly figures and [missing character] fist guards, played Lu Zhishen; the master of Hongdouguan, with his white hair and childlike face, and long beard hanging down his chest, played the old monk; Mr. Wang Jiean, a native of Wu, with a Suzhou accent, played the wine seller, which can be called a natural match, and is hard to find. Others, such as the "Jian Niang" by Mr. Shen Hengyi and Mr. Pu Xiyuan, the reverse singing of Guan Gong by Mr. Zhu Yaowen, the reverse singing of "The Training of Guan Ping" by the master of Letian, the reverse singing of storytelling by Mr. Li Mengzou's wife, Ms. Xia Xunru, and the reverse singing of "Sharpening the Axe" by Mr. Peng Zhimin, were all very beautiful. Then, there was the "Si Fan" by the master of Hongdouguan, an old man with white hair, performing a young female nun. Her voice was like a chickadee out of the valley, and her figure was like a willow in the wind, which was really rare and valuable. The "Ting Hui" by Mr. Gu Chuanjie and the "Ci Hu" by Mr. Zhang Chuanfang can be called pure fire and green, and are enough to be old masters of the wheel. The "Sao Hua" by Mr. Zang Zibin, his pronunciation of the words was meticulous, accurate and exceptional, is a rare one among the Qingke. Paired with the "Ke Xiangu" by the master of Hongdouguan, they complemented each other. By the time the meeting was dismissed, the bell had struck ten o'clock.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden in the Former Capital (111)

— Xu Muyun

"Heavenly Thunder Retribution" and "A Handful of Snow" are all plays written by the actors themselves

"Heavenly Thunder Retribution" was originally a work play performed by male and old female roles in Han classes, but later it was taken over by Pi Huang classes, and now it has become a famous play of the Tan school. When Old Tan first performed this play, Zhang Po was originally played by Zhou Changshun. Zhou was a famous old female role at that time, so the performance was very brilliant. After Changshun died, Tan looked around the old female role line and there was no one who could take his place, so the clown Wang Changlin played Zhang Po in reverse, known as Yu Shuyan, the successor of the Tan school, and Ma Lianliang, who is in the male role line today, also often posted to perform this play; and the old female role was all played by Wang Shuanzi. In fact, Yu and Ma's "Heavenly Thunder Retribution" are all supported by Changlin, so this old man is the most suitable, and the performance has the wonderful effect of complementing each other.

The meaning of this play originally contains the elements of teaching through religion. Its popularity among the people is as deep as the famous play "Zhu Hen Ji" of the Cheng school in the minds of women and children. However, the names of "Heavenly Thunder Retribution" and "Zhu Hen Ji" are not as popular as the names of "Lei Da Zhang Jibao" and "Mu Yang Juan", because the villagers do not understand the written words very well, so they can only remember some simple play names, and they all know that this is a performance of the true story of a man and a woman being struck to death by thunder. Therefore, whenever parents encounter an unfilial son, or a village produces an unvirtuous woman, they will always take the disobedient son Zhang Jibao and Zhu Chundeng's aunt to talk about it. (To take someone as a story means to use someone as an analogy)

According to what I heard from an old Guqu performer, Zhang Jibao was not only not struck to death by thunder, but on the contrary, he was a very filial person and a very honest official. Just imagine, how could there be such a conscience-stricken person in the world? He was taken in by Zhang Lao when he was young, and the old couple made straw shoes and ground small mills, and it was not easy to raise this boy for more than ten years. Later, he was recognized by his birth mother, and soon he became the top scholar. When he passed by Qingfeng Pavilion, his adoptive father and adoptive mother asked him to adopt them, but he not only turned his face and refused to recognize them, but also forced his benefactress to death, and only rewarded his adoptive father with two hundred copper coins.

The structure is subtle, and it is deeply understood to be like the game. It can be called wonderful.
