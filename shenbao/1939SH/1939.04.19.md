### China Determined to Fight to the End, Striving for Survival, Independence, and Freedom; Advocating Surrender is a Spiritual Death Sentence; Only by Dealing a Fatal Blow to Japan Can There Be Hope for Peace; The Strategy of Resistance Has Been Decided Five Years Ago and Will Generally Not Be Changed

(Chongqing) After the memorial week on the 17th, many Chinese and foreign journalists asked Chairman Chiang the following questions. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:

Reporter: Some people now say that Konoe's statement on "establishing a new order in East Asia" can be used as the basis for peace between China and Japan, and do not consider it to be a condition for national subjugation. How does the Chairman think this should be dealt with?

Chairman Chiang: "Establishing a new order in East Asia" is just a new term for Japan's annexation of China. In my speech on December 26 last year, I have already analyzed the enemy's aggressive ambitions in detail, so there is no need to say more. If Konoe's statement is interpreted as a "peace" condition, then there is no need for the word "surrender" in the dictionary. This is an extremely shameless joke, not only will it not happen today, but it will never happen. The purpose of China's resistance is to protect the survival, independence, and freedom of the entire nation. If this goal cannot be achieved in one day, our struggle will not stop for a day. Now, the longer the war continues, the more Japan's weaknesses are exposed, and its ambitions become more obvious. This is the so-called "the dagger is revealed when the map is unrolled to the end" principle. Looking at the actions of the Japanese warlords, anyone can know that they want to take the life of our entire nation and make us their slaves forever. Konoe's so-called "establishing a new order in East Asia" is Japan's vicious plan to dominate East Asia, not only to eliminate China, but also to eliminate all forces of all countries in the Pacific. Japan's aggressive desires are advancing with the times, and China's understanding of the progress of Japan's ambitions is also becoming clearer, so our will to resist is becoming stronger. Under these circumstances, there is absolutely no room for peace, and it will never be shaken by any clever, hypocritical theory of surrender. Our entire nation is united, and for those who advocate such an extremely shameless argument, I believe that the effectiveness of our Chinese principles, morality, and conscience will be greater than the effectiveness of legal sanctions. Such people have already declared their death sentence in spirit and are really not worth mentioning. As for the state's punishment, it depends on their future actions. Reporter: May I ask how the Sino-Japanese war can be resolved?

Chairman Chiang: This question depends on how the facts evolve in the future. We have only been resisting for twenty-two months, which is less than two years, and Japan's international status as a first-class country has already been lowered to the status of a second-class country by our resistance. If we intensify our resistance, according to the facts of the past, I believe that in the near future, it will inevitably make his current status as a second-class country unstable. In this way, on the one hand, his national strength will be more exhausted and his status will be lower, and on the other hand, we must strengthen our own strength to reach a favorable time and a favorable terrain, and give him a fatal blow, so that he can truly recognize the power of China's resistance, and then there will be hope for peace. I believe that this is not only possible, but as long as we work hard, the arrival of this time will be very soon. Apart from this, if we want to restore peace between China and Japan, then unless the Japanese warlords have a thorough awakening and voluntarily give up their aggression and fundamentally change their traditional policies. If they do not fundamentally abandon their aggressive policies and cannot eradicate their so-called "new order in East Asia" dream, then not only will the Sino-Japanese war absolutely not end, but East Asia will never have peace. Today, any descendant of the Yellow Emperor with a conscience in the Chinese nation, no matter how low their level of knowledge is, will never say that Konoe's "new order in East Asia" is not a condition for national subjugation to annex China. The enemy's ambitions and the Chinese people's understanding have become clear to this point. If there are still people who argue that Konoe's statement is not a condition for the demise of China, and think that it is still possible to make peace, then what is this if not seeking to surrender and betray the country? To put it bluntly, such people not only do not hesitate to be traitors, but are simply willing to be slaves of Japan.

Reporter: How will the war situation evolve in the future? Will China still adhere to the original strategy of protracted war to the end? Chairman Chiang: Five years ago, I had a speech on "Resisting Foreign Insults and Revitalizing the Nation," discussing our strategy of resistance when a war breaks out between China and Japan. If you just read my speech, you can know that the strategy we are using today was decided five years ago. We will never change the entire strategy and consistent policy of "trading space for time, accumulating small victories into big victories." At that time, we decided that if we did not fight, we would not fight, and if we fought, we must persevere to the end. Even if the entire country is completely lost, we have the confidence and confidence to recover it. At that time, we thought from the most unfavorable situation and made the final decision. At that time, it was estimated that it would take the enemy sixteen months to invade our eighteen provinces. Now that we have been resisting for twenty-two months, we can still maintain many complete provinces. Even the provinces that have been occupied have only lost a few cities and strongholds. In those provinces, all the land and people are still under the control of our army. The enemy not only has nothing to gain, but is also following our planned plans, falling into the quagmire and stepping into the road of collapse. In the future, they will be subject to our final fatal blow anytime and anywhere. Therefore, today, in terms of the overall situation of the war of resistance, we must not observe the final success or failure of the war of resistance with the gains and losses of a few cities and strongholds. After everyone understands our consistent policy and the entire strategy, they will no longer be deceived by those shameless traitorous theories that speak for the enemy. (18th dispatch)

### Japanese Army Attacks Paitan in Three Routes; Heavy Casualties After Being Defeated; The Two Armies on the Left Wing Were Still in Battle Yesterday; Japanese Attempt to Counterattack Zengcheng Makes No Progress

Editorial

### Observing International Phenomena

Everything related to international phenomena is becoming increasingly complex; if one only looks at it occasionally, one will inevitably feel dazzled and unable to understand it; but because the problem is at hand and the interests are closely related, I wonder how many people are eager to understand it. For ordinary people, without basic common sense, they will not know where the problem comes from; without continuous attention, they will not know the recent ups and downs and evolution of the problem. If one goes further from the phenomena to seek the future trends, it is certainly not easy to say. British diplomacy has always been praised by the world, because the British have an almost innate talent for international intelligence; the national government has a long history, not to mention. However, enduring humiliation and seeking perfection at Munich still did not help the failure of the appeasement policy; the Conservative Party gentlemen not only respectfully kept their distance from Communist Russia, but also hated it like poisonous snakes and beasts, but now they are rushing to Moscow, fearing that they will be too late; for Eastern Europe, they manipulate it when it is convenient, and abandon it when they cannot manipulate it, but now they are generously giving Poland and other countries guarantees without shirking great burdens; all these are recent masterpieces of Britain, how can British diplomacy be unpredictable? If, a few months ago, one asked a British person with international intelligence whether the appeasement policy would be humiliated by Germany and Italy, and Germany and Italy would be subjected to restraint, Britain would pay tribute to Soviet Russia, and bear a heavier responsibility in Eastern Europe than Soviet Russia, they would scoff and regard the questioner as unbelievable, because these are all questions that violate international common sense. In just a few days, all the phenomena are outside the original common sense; thus it can be seen that matters related to international affairs are difficult to say. However, international affairs are not without principles and cannot be said at all. All joys and sorrows, separations and reunions, ultimately cannot escape the principles of interests. This is certainly an old saying, but one may be deceived by temporary phenomena and ignore the principles, or one may work hard but achieve little because of ignoring the principles. Let's prove it with recent events in the Far East.

The other day, English leaflets were found among the English and French in Shanghai, attacking England and France in the name of the Chinese Communist Party, saying that England and France are enemies of China. Anti-British slogans in Chinese were also found in the occupied areas of China. These two things, regardless of the existence of different ideologies in China, regardless of the language used for expression, in short, cannot be wrongly attributed to the Chinese. Why? Because it violates the principles of interests. China is resisting Japan in order to seek the freedom and survival of the nation. China initiates it, and no other country can instigate it, nor can any other country prevent it. England, France, and Soviet Russia sympathize with China for justice. This kind of motivation should not be ignored; however, the reason for assisting China is still above justice. If Japan destroys China, England, France, and Soviet Russia will all suffer; if China defeats Japan, England, France, and Soviet Russia will all enjoy the fruits; if England, France, and Soviet Russia sit back and watch China fighting the enemy alone without providing assistance, the war will last longer and become more cruel, and England, France, and Soviet Russia will suffer a worse impact; if England, France, and Soviet Russia assist China in fighting the enemy, the common interests of China, England, France, and Soviet Russia will become more and more brilliant. Those who invade China are China's enemies; those who help China are China's friends. Interests are clear, and friends and enemies are clear. How can any words be used to reverse or change them? Clarity is seen by all, how can any surgery be used to cover up or confuse it? Therefore, although anti-British slogans are written in Chinese, the Chinese authorities are not blamed; although the leaflets attacking England and France are in the name of the Chinese Communist Party, the British Reuters is happy to transmit the Chinese Communist Party's words of denial. Only those who ignore the principles of interests and do this, not only have no effect, but only expose their hard work and achieve little. Not only these kinds of things have happened, but Japanese newspapers and magazines often express doubts about the sincere unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China; the Japanese authorities even attribute their failure in aggression to the assistance of various countries to China, and regard the assistance to China as unexpected. Their intention seems to be: the plan of aggression does not assume the unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, nor does it assume the assistance of various countries to China. The facts are beyond the assumptions, so the difficulties and failures are beyond the plan. In fact, the internal unity of China and the external support are by no means due to emotions or propaganda, but a necessary phenomenon that conforms to the principles of interests; they are only blinded by profit and ignore it. Following this to infer general international phenomena, no matter how complex they are, no matter how the future evolution will tend to go, no matter how many changes will emerge endlessly and be impossible to predict or assert; however, according to where the principles lie, those who oppose aggression will inevitably respond to each other and become closer because of shared fortunes and misfortunes; the aggressors will inevitably suffer defeat because they may turn against each other due to conflicting interests and must become more and more isolated. According to this fixed understanding, one will be able to grasp a fixed view of the chaotic international situation without being confused!

Japanese Aircraft Cross Border to Attack Mengzi

### External Affairs Has Aroused Attention From French Authorities; Air Force Headquarters Lists Important Evidence; Attack on Eurasia Aircraft is Further Proof

(Chongqing) The Chinese Air Force Headquarters issued a statement today stating that the Japanese aircraft participating in the air raid on Mengzi on the Dian-Vietnam Railway on April 13 flew through French airspace to reach their destination. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has aroused the attention of the French and Vietnamese authorities to this cross-border incident. According to the statement issued by the headquarters, the Japanese aircraft participating in the air raid on Mengzi on April 13 took off from Weizhou Island in Tokyo Bay, flew through French Vietnam and Laojie on the Dian-Vietnam border, flew directly to Gejiu west of Mengzi, and then turned east to bomb Mengzi. The following locations can prove what we said: (1) The air defense watchtowers in Wenshan (Kaihua) and Xisha (both transliterated above), near the southwest corner of Yunnan Province, did not see enemy aircraft flying back and forth on that day. According to the above two places, they are on the direct route from the Japanese air base on Weizhou Island to Diannan, where Mengzi is located. (2) Zhennanguan on the Guizhou-Vietnam border first saw the Japanese aircraft that bombed Mengzi, and then saw it in Laojie on the Dian-Vietnam border, but Wenshan and Xisha clearly did not see it fly over, which proves that the Japanese aircraft must have taken the nearby route through Vietnam to reach Mengzi. Another proof is that Eurasia Company's mail aircraft No. 19 was attacked near Laojie at that time. If the Japanese aircraft did not fly through Vietnam, this would never have happened. Gejiu is 20 miles west of Mengzi, so the Japanese aircraft could never have reached Gejiu via Mengzi without being seen. The only explanation is that the Japanese aircraft flew through Vietnam to Gejiu, and then turned east. (18th Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the German pilot injured in the Eurasia aircraft shot down by Japanese aircraft in Laojie on April 13 will arrive in Kunming within days. The aircraft only carried one Chinese passenger, who was safe and sound. A rescue aircraft discovered the downed aircraft 80 kilometers from Laojie within Chinese territory, but there was no temporary airfield near the location, so the rescue aircraft could not land and flew to Kunming to report. As for the details of the damage and attack on the aircraft, it will only be known after the German pilot arrives in Kunming. According to Chinese sources, the Eurasia aircraft damaged by Japanese aircraft during the air raid on Kunming on April 8 has been transported to Hong Kong for repairs. (18th Reuters dispatch)

### Fear of Chinese Air Force Bombing Kyushu; Conducting Air Defense Exercises

(Tokyo) The Army Ministry authorities here announced today that the Japanese authorities in Kyushu had received news that the Chinese government was planning to bomb Japanese territory, and therefore held a large-scale air defense exercise last week. It was also claimed that Japanese aircraft were bombing Chinese air bases everywhere in order to thwart the Chinese plan. It was said that all the aircraft that the Chinese authorities intended to send to attack Japan had been destroyed by Japanese aircraft. As a result, the Kyushu area has cancelled its special alert.

Xiao Jishan Talks About

Resistance with a Victorious Spirit

Analyzing China in Growth

Los Angeles Xiao Jishan, deputy head of the overseas branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, came to the United States on official business and is about to go to Washington. He recently made a statement to the local press, saying that a new China is growing in the interior. "The national manpower and material resources have all been moved to the interior. In the past, our country relied on the coastal areas as its economic lifeline, and the infinite resources of the interior, whether mining or agricultural, could not be fully developed. Now we will rely on these resources to deal with Japan. Once China defeats Japan, Germany and Italy's attempt to control the world will also be shattered." After Xiao finishes his official business in Washington, he still needs to travel in the United States for two months before returning to China. (18th Havas dispatch)

### The Su Bao on the Chinese Situation: Ultimate Victory is Obtainable; China's Manpower is Limitless, Resources Abundant; Japan Already Feels the Crisis of Collapse

(Hong Kong) Moscow dispatch, Moscow newspapers recently discussed the situation in China, stating that China possesses all possibilities for achieving final victory. China's manpower is limitless, and its natural resources are sufficient for China to engage in military and economic development in the southwestern provinces. Soviet figures pay close attention to the construction plans in inland provinces such as Sichuan, generally believing that China has received spiritual and financial assistance from abroad during the stage of resisting the aggressors. All peace-loving countries have expressed sympathy toward China, and foreign assistance is sufficient to help China launch its long-term war of resistance against Japan until victory is achieved. Conversely, Japan's burden in the war against China has made the country feel the crisis of ultimate collapse. Until last year, Japan's wartime economy was supported by its reserves, but now those reserves have been depleted. In 1938 alone, Japan's war expenses in China amounted to at least 700 million yen, and military losses were at least 700,000 men. Japan's industry originally relied on foreign exports, so Japan cannot be allowed to engage in a long-term war of aggression on the Asian continent. (Dispatch of the 17th)

### Will the Japanese Army Invade Changsha? The Further Their Muddy Feet Reach, the Deeper They Will Sink; A Reckless Western Invasion Will Inevitably Suffer Unprecedented Defeat

(Chongqing) Since the Chinese army recently abandoned Nanchang, both domestic and foreign observers have paid close attention to the future war situation, especially regarding the Japanese army's possible attempt to invade Changsha. All parties are greatly concerned about this, and some even believe that if the Japanese army occupies Changsha for even one day, it will be able to control the western provinces of China, thereby seeking resources to reduce its own military burden. Our correspondent recently visited the spokesman of the Military Affairs Commission to inquire about everything. I was honored to have him make the following statement:

On the surface, the enemy's occupation of Nanchang and the cutting off of our Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will make transportation more difficult and will undoubtedly have a considerable impact on the future war situation. However, upon closer inspection, it is clear that our army's resolute decision to abandon Nanchang not only has no impact on the future war situation, but may even be

Advantageous to Us

First, from a military perspective, this decision in the Ganbei campaign, after weeks of bloody fighting, was made because our army used its advantages properly, and the officers and soldiers regarded death as home. We have thoroughly completed the task of attrition warfare. The main force of the enemy's Central China Expeditionary Army suffered more than 30,000 casualties, with four dead regimental commanders, many battalion commanders, and many other important officers. Their combat strength has been greatly weakened. The main purpose of our army's combat is to use the mountains to lure the enemy deep. When the majority of the enemy's main force is attracted to a suitable area, the enemy's various mechanized weapons will lose their effectiveness. Then, we can exert our army's advantages and inflict a

Fatal Blow

To make them lose their combat capability. The gain or loss of a city or a place is not important. The enemy made this decision to invade Ganbei, and the sacrifice was so great, which is precisely why. Our army's abandonment of Nanchang and the transfer of its main force to advantageous positions are also necessary measures. In the future, the further the enemy's muddy feet reach, the deeper they will sink. If they further launch a reckless invasion of Changsha, then the degree of their sacrifice will inevitably be even greater, without a doubt. This is one. Second, from a political perspective, since the enemy occupied Wuhan, they have fallen into a trap that we had set in advance. The enemy's manpower, financial resources, and material resources have all reached a point that is not permitted by their national policy. Therefore, after the Wuhan encirclement battle came to an end, the enemy's military actions fell into a state of

Inability to Advance Further

On the one hand, they issued the so-called Konoe Statement, using the guise of peace to lure us into their trap. However, under our national policy of protracted war of resistance, this conspiracy failed to materialize, and their political strategy completely failed. Recently, the enemy's anti-war anger has been raging like wildfire, and the disintegration of domestic morale and the decline of morale at the front have both reached an extreme level. The launch of the Ganbei campaign this time was only intended to divert attention and ease the anti-war psychology of the military and civilians, but unexpectedly, the price paid was so great. Therefore, the morale of the people and soldiers feels even more uneasy, and future battles will be

Increasingly Difficult

If they invade Changsha to the west, the price they pay will naturally be even greater than any number can estimate. This is the second point. Third, from an economic perspective, the enemy has spent more than 100 million yuan in war expenses in this invasion of China, and the total amount of public debt has reached 160 million yuan, most of which is a deficit. It is now estimated that an average of about 14 million yuan is needed per day, and even if they scrape everything clean, they will not be able to do it. Their attempt to plunder resources in China is very active, but in the occupied areas, there are our guerrilla armies, cooperating with the people's armed forces, constantly giving them

Restless Nights

After occupying Nanchang, they turned west to invade Changsha, and even if our Zhejiang-Jiangxi and even Hunan-Jiangxi communications were completely cut off, our center of gravity for foreign transportation is not in the southeast coast. What is imported from the southeast coast is only a part of luxury goods that consume money. In the future, if the road for importing these luxury goods is cut off, in addition to invisibly saving us a lot of people's power and national power, we can concentrate all our efforts on other transportation routes, and the adjustment of the entry and exit of various important materials will actually be

Harmless to Us

The enemy's attempt to plunder our resources is still impossible to achieve, so how can they control our western provinces? Therefore, we know that no matter from a military, political, or economic point of view, the enemy's occupation of Nanchang, and even the invasion of Changsha to the west, only proves their dying struggle. The time of their total collapse must not be far away, and we are fighting to uphold the independence and survival of the country and the nation, and for the universal principles of justice and righteousness. Our manpower, financial resources, and material resources are inexhaustible, so we can fight stronger and stronger, more and more bravely. Final victory must belong to us, and the situation of our enemy after the abandonment of Nanchang is already clear to us. (Dispatch of the 18th)

### Organizing an Anti-Aggression Alliance: British-Soviet Negotiations Proceed Smoothly; Agreement on Air Force Mutual Assistance Already Reached; Timing Not Yet Ripe for Turkey's Participation

(London) The British-Soviet negotiations on an anti-aggression military alliance have taken a sharp turn for the better due to the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, returning to the Soviet Union to report. It is said that this extraordinary development is closely related to President Roosevelt's call for peace. This move greatly helped to boost the momentum and courage of the anti-aggression front in Europe, and at the same time, it placed the responsibility for future wars on Hitler and Mussolini. It is generally believed that even if the United States does not help Britain and France with military force, it will definitely sympathize with Britain and France spiritually. Some quarters believe that if a war breaks out, at a certain stage, the United States is very likely to provide military assistance to Britain and France. (United Press dispatch of the 18th)

(Paris) The French authorities reported last night that Britain and France have reached an agreement with the Soviet Union that if a European war breaks out, the two countries can use the Soviet air force. With this new agreement, the status quo countries have 12,000 aircraft, enough to counter the 10,000 aircraft of the Rome-Berlin axis. At the same time, a cabinet meeting was convened today to study the latest developments in the international situation. (United Press dispatch of the 18th)

(London) Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky flew back to Moscow this morning to submit a report to his government on the ongoing negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. In addition, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds will continue talks with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

(London) Regarding Turkey's accession to the collective security organization, Turkish Ambassador Rüştü had talks with British foreign authorities again this morning. Well-informed sources here recently announced that it will be difficult for Britain and Turkey to reach an agreement within a few days. Prime Minister Chamberlain will not mention this in his report to the House of Commons today on the international situation, because Turkey is in close contact with the Soviet Union and is afraid that it will have to wait until the British and Soviet negotiations are completed before it is willing to sign an agreement with Britain. What Britain and Turkey are currently discussing is how to amend the Montreux Convention (the convention on the re-fortification of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits) so that the British fleet can freely pass through the two straits to aid Romania when necessary. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

Istanbul Political figures here declared that the purpose of the negotiations between Britain and Turkey seems to be only to obtain a unilateral agreement guaranteeing Turkey's complete independence. At the same time, Britain has also proposed a loan to Turkey, following the precedent of Poland. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 18th)

### British Prime Minister Reports on the International Situation in the House of Commons: Expresses Satisfaction with Roosevelt's Support; Seeks Peace But Does Not Forget to Prepare for War

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that the British government has not reached any special agreement with the Netherlands, Switzerland, or Denmark in the event that any of these countries is invaded. As for maintaining the independence of various countries, it is beneficial to the British government, which is no need to say much of. Opposition leader Attlee rose to ask the Prime Minister if he could make any remarks on the international situation. The Prime Minister replied that the government has continued to consult closely with other relevant governments, including the Soviet Union. Therefore, in addition to the remarks he made on behalf of the government on April 13 guaranteeing assistance to Greece and Romania to resist aggression, he has not been able to continue to make statements. He wished to take this opportunity to inform the House that the British government expressed great satisfaction with President Roosevelt's recent initiative. When the Prime Minister mentioned the United States, the entire field cheered, and it took a while to stop. A member of parliament asked the Prime Minister if he could announce any new plans aimed at increasing Britain's ability to fulfill its recently expanded responsibilities. The Prime Minister replied that the government is currently engaged in accelerating and expanding the basis of production in order to cope with the increased war potential. In view of recent developments, the government has taken precautions to address the increased needs. The Prime Minister also replied to a question about the supply department, saying that he would express his views on this matter in the near future. Army Minister Bellesha replied to a question about the white rifle, stating that he is currently expanding production and building sufficient manufacturing capacity in Canada. Australia, South Africa, and India have all discussed the establishment of factories to build this gun. The regular army infantry at home and abroad, except for those in India and Myanmar, have been equipped with this gun, which will be manufactured on a wartime scale. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

Wartime Food Control

Plan Already Completed

(London) The plan for the Ministry of Food to issue rations and control the national food supply during wartime has been completed. This work will be undertaken by 19 district offices and 1,400 local committees.

### Danzig-Corridor Issue: German-Polish Negotiations Underway; Germany Does Not Want to Be Willing to Be the First to Light the Fuse of War; Britain Again Shows Generosity at Others' Expense, Advising Poland to Make Concessions

United Press reporter Betty telegraphed from Berlin on the 18th According to news from the German Social Democratic Party last night, Germany and Poland are about to reach an agreement for Danzig to be returned to Germany. The public believes that Germany is negotiating with Poland for the return of Danzig, the solution of the minority issue, and the issue of granting Germany a passage through the Polish border. All National Socialist Party news firmly assert that Germany will not seize Danzig by force, for fear that any aggressive action against Danzig or the Polish Corridor will cause a European war. Obviously, Germany still hopes to avoid war for the time being. (United Press dispatch of the 18th)

(London) The Liberal Party newspaper News Chronicle recently published a telegram from its Berlin correspondent stating that the fate of the Free City of Danzig may be decided within a few days. "Although the Polish government has a firm attitude, it is widely rumored in Berlin that Britain has made friendly advice to Poland, advising it to negotiate the Danzig issue with Germany. According to Polish sources in Berlin, no matter what demands Germany makes, Poland should deal with it in a spirit of understanding. However, if the Free City of Danzig 'voluntarily' makes a decision, Poland should stop it." (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

### British and French Fleets Gather to Jointly Defend Mediterranean Interests; German Fleet Sets Off to Patrol Spanish Territorial Waters; Gibraltar Authorities Take Defensive Measures

(London) Reuters has learned that almost the entire British Mediterranean Fleet is now concentrated on and near Malta, the British military base in the Mediterranean. Only a few British warships, mostly destroyers, are stationed in Gibraltar, with Rhodes as their base. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

(Paris) The British and French governments have taken the necessary measures to prepare for the unexpected, in case Germany and Italy take any action against British Gibraltar or the international neutral port of Tangier in North Africa. This is also to offset the pressure exerted by Germany and Italy on General Franco. This can be seen from the fact that 16 French warships have sailed to Gibraltar to join the British warships in defense. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources here recently declared that if the current status of the Port of Gibraltar is undermined, no matter by which country, Britain and France will consider their vital interests to be threatened. Fortunately, this situation may not materialize, but there is a great concern that Germany and Italy are trying to persuade Spain to sign a military alliance with them to enrich the Anti-Comintern Pact. In addition, France and Spain are conducting negotiations through diplomatic channels. Spanish Ambassador to France Leguerica informed Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday that his country is willing to maintain its independent and autonomous status, but well-informed sources here are still afraid that Spain will not be able to break free from the shackles of Germany and Italy. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

(Paris) All walks of life are paying close attention to the concentration of French warships in the Port of Gibraltar. According to reports in the local newspapers this morning, the 16 French warships that sailed to the Port of Gibraltar are: the cruisers "Lorraine," "Marseille," "Galissonnière," and "Jean de Vienne," the torpedo destroyers "Mogador," "Volta," "Gloire," "Fantasque," and "L'Indomptable," the torpedo boats "Cyclone," "Siroco," "Simoun," "Fortuné," "Trombe," and "Brestois." According to "Le Matin," the concentration of a large number of French warships in the Port of Gibraltar is rare for many years. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 18th)

Wilhelmshaven A naval fleet, including two battleships, two cruisers, two destroyer flotillas, and three submarine flotillas, set off from here this morning and sailed to the Spanish waters to patrol back and forth for a period of one month. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

Gibraltar The Spanish authorities have recently concentrated tens of thousands of troops in the area near the port. The local authorities have therefore rushed to build solid obstacles on the northern highway and near the Spanish border to prepare for the unexpected. It is learned that a large number of Spanish troops have arrived in La Linea, and a cavalry regiment also arrived in San Roque this morning. Another regiment will arrive in Algeciras this afternoon. In addition, there are 13 German warships anchored here. Several more will follow today. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)In Danzig only once, that is, before becoming the German Chancellor in 1932 to conduct an election campaign, he flew to Danzig for a short stay. There were three honorary citizens in the city of Danzig before, one was the late German President Hindenburg, one was the leader of the Danzig City National Socialist Party District Party Headquarters, Forster, and one was the East Prussian poet Halbe. Therefore, Mr. Xi is the fourth honorary citizen of Danzig. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 18th)

### Hungarian Prime Minister Appoints Officials to Rome for Political Talks, Seeking to Promote Hungarian-Southern Hungarian-Romanian Relations; Romanian Foreign Minister Arrives in Berlin

(Rome) Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki, Foreign Minister Csáky, and their entourage arrived here this morning. The station was beautifully decorated. Prime Minister Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, and several political leaders welcomed them at the station. The Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's visit to Rome is scheduled for four days, staying at the Villa Madama, which General Göring just vacated. After laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier this morning, Teleki and Csáky proceeded to the Royal Palace to meet King Victor Emmanuel III and had lunch at the palace. In the afternoon, they began political talks with Mussolini. (Haitong Telegraph, 18th)

(Budapest) According to the "Ujság" newspaper's Rome correspondent, Italian political figures attach great importance to the visit of Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Csáky to Rome. It is pointed out that the late Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös's visit to Rome occurred during the Abyssinian War. This time, the Hungarian Prime Minister's visit to Rome is also taking place during a historically significant period for Italy, demonstrating Hungary's firm friendship with Italy. According to the newspaper, the main topics of discussion during the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's visit to Rome are the following three: (1) The most important is the Central European issue, including the plan to promote friendship between Italy and Yugoslavia, and seeking a final resolution of relations between Southern Hungary and Hungary; (2) Secondly, the relationship between Hungary and Romania will also be one of the issues discussed, as Italy strongly hopes for an improvement in Hungarian-Romanian relations; (3) Finally, the Hungarian-Italian talks will definitely discuss various issues to promote economic and cultural relations between the two countries. (Haitong Telegraph, 18th)

(Berlin) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here at 1:40 PM today. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop welcomed him at the station and immediately hosted a banquet. Foreign Minister Gafencu plans to stay here for three days to hold talks with German authorities. (Havas Telegraph, 18th)

(Berlin) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's visit here will arrive tomorrow and be blooded at the earliest at 9:00 AM on the 19th, to meet with Führer Hitler, and then hold talks with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, regarding British guarantees of Romanian security. Romanian sources here recently claimed that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is expected to request Romania to provide assurances not to grant the same guarantees to Britain. Foreign Minister Gafencu is only expected to answer that any country is welcome to provide guarantees to Romania. At the same time, he is expected to declare that any proposal that seeks to change the territorial status quo to Romania's disadvantage will be rejected without consideration. After completing his mission here, Foreign Minister Gafencu will proceed to visit Belgium and Britain, and then go to Paris on the 25th of this month for a three-day stay. (Havas Telegraph, 17th)

### US Naval Strategy Emphasizes Western Transfer to Monitor Japanese Actions, Avoiding Concerns of Britain and France Having to Attend to the Far East

(Washington) The Navy Department's decision to return the fleet to the Pacific this week has led to speculation here that the United States may soon take concrete steps to improve its naval facilities in the Pacific, with particular emphasis on the defense of the southern west coast of the United States. American military strategists have long believed that if the United States wants to fully protect the Panama Canal and resist attacks on the southern west coast of the United States, it must establish a new base south of San Diego. The US Navy's strategy is to repel enemy forces before they reach Hawaii's defenses. However, enemy aircraft may still break through the US border defense line south of Hawaii, making the Panama Canal and the southern west coast of the United States vulnerable to attack. Regarding future developments in this regard, naval officials here declined to comment, but privately expressed the view that the United States is considering purchasing the Galapagos Islands as an air force and submarine base. The "Washington Post" stated that the recall of US ships to the West Coast is a natural result of the development of the European situation and Japan's recent occupation of the New Hebrides Islands. If a European war breaks out, Japan will continue to expand southward. The "Washington Star" stated that the movement of the US fleet "shows the United States' attention to the Pacific and, to some extent, prepares to reduce British and French fears in the Far East." (Associated Press, 18th)

(Washington) Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, today advocated expanding the navy and air force to defend the United States and prevent unforeseen circumstances. He stated that the country has coastlines on two sides and cannot be adequately defended by a one-ocean navy. At the same time, Walsh called for amending the Neutrality Act to prohibit trade with belligerent countries after the outbreak of war, and proposed that the government should not favor one side or express support or opposition to foreign disputes. Walsh compared the current situation with the situation before the United States entered World War I and warned the Senate, "Today, some people are making shameless and delusional propaganda in a similar form, trying to drag us into the current European dispute, which has nothing to do with us and threatens to cause a second world war." Walsh discussed the United States' defense needs, saying that, for example, the destruction of the Panama Canal would throw the current one-ocean fleet defense system into chaos. (Reuters, 17th)

US Neutrality Law

Cash and Carry Clause May Expire

(Washington) Senator Pittman stated today that although the European situation is quite tense, the "cash and carry" clause in the Neutrality Act may expire on April 30. Pittman had previously expressed the opinion that this clause might be extended and amended. It is now heard from responsible sources that Pittman has slightly delayed his plan to ask Congress to restrict US trade with Japan because Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty. (Reuters, 18th)

### United States Should Sever Trade Relations with Japan, Which Would Put Japan's War Effort in Difficulty; Professor Fenwick Expresses Views

(Washington) Professor Fenwick of Political Science at Bryn Mawr College today asked participants in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to quickly pass the Thomson resolution, which prohibits continued trade with belligerent countries or countries that violate treaties. According to the professor, "If the United States implements this ban on trade, Japan's war machine could be in trouble within two weeks." Republican Senator White then stated that the "cash transaction" clause of the Thomson resolution "will be detrimental to China because China itself does not have ships to transport goods." But Professor Fenwick replied that China's ability to obtain ships is no different from Norway and Denmark, and that "the impact of current US assistance to Japan on international law and international order is no different from the tyranny of dictators." Fenwick also said that Thomson's resolution "will prevent Germany from invading Poland" and save the outbreak of a European war. Socialist leader Thomson had opposed Pittman's amendment to the Neutrality Act and also argued that the President should not be given greater power when implementing the Neutrality Act. He also said that the United States has been misled by the theory that implementing the Neutrality Act would harm China and has never implemented it. He did not know that this action by the United States has made the United States a collaborator with Japan, since most of the munitions and materials for Japan's war against China are supplied by the United States. But Thomson also does not advocate economic sanctions, because if economic sanctions are implemented, a direct conflict between the United States and Japan will be more likely to occur than a war with Germany, because the Philippines is most vulnerable to attack.

Aid China Movement

Spare No Effort in Propaganda to Prohibit Arms Shipments to Japan

Havas News Agency, New York, March 28 - The "Don't Encourage Japanese Aggression Committee," composed of people from all walks of life in the United States and chaired by former Secretary of State Stimson as honorary chairman, has recently been actively leading public opinion and hoping that the government will stop the people from selling military supplies to Japan, sparing no effort. It even explicitly pointed out that the bombs used by Japanese aircraft when the US gunboat "Panay" was sunk in the upper reaches of Nanjing on December 12, 1937, were made in the United States. The committee's secretary, Price, recently stated that 175,000 members of Christian groups in New York State had submitted a petition to Congressman Fish, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, requesting that Congress pass a law to restrict the shipment of US military supplies to Japan during the Sino-Japanese War.

The Tokyo Municipal Government will issue new bonds with a face value of 707.75 francs to pay off matured interest or drawn bonds, to be paid off in 25 years at an annual interest rate of five percent. (Reuters, 17th)

(London) The London branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank of Japan recently announced that the Osaka City Five-Percent Public Bonds, which will mature on May 1, will be redeemed on that day. Only the News Chronicle commented on this, saying that the repayment of this public bond may be of some help to Japan's credibility, which is in urgent need of assistance. (Reuters, 18th)

Malaya Attributes Huge Sums to Imperial Defense Costs

(London) British newspapers are now publishing the news that the Straits Settlements Legislative Council intends to move to allocate £1 million to Britain for national defense expenditures, and several newspapers have attached reports on previous donations from Malaya and the achievements of local automatic defense plans. The Times, in its editorial on Pacific defense and news on the current British Imperial Conference, called Malaya a colony capable of coping with incidents and now donating huge sums to imperial defense. The Financial Times commented today on Malaya's repeated contributions of huge sums, saying that Malaya's decision is by no means a temporary impulsive result of patriotic worry, but a sign of consistent support for the British Empire and firm approval of the doctrine held by the British Academy.

### Roosevelt Warns Dictatorial Nations: A Great Contribution to Peace; All Nations Worldwide Echo Support, Offering Spiritual Aid to Britain and France

(Washington) Following President Roosevelt's telegrams to German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, newspapers in those countries are filled with opposing views. People here are quite pessimistic as a result. It is learned that the President received detailed reports from Europe on the 8th of this month, advocating urgent action to prevent serious incidents. This was one reason for the President's resolute telegrams. However, some individuals believe that the President's action is clearly a warning to the dictatorial nations and also serves two other purposes: first, to strengthen the allied relationships of countries opposing aggression; and second, to guide domestic public opinion, which has been quite uncertain since the Congressional debates on neutrality laws. After the telegrams were sent, the vast majority of public opinion expressed approval, recognizing this as a powerful move calling for peace, fully in line with the traditional spirit of American presidents intervening to safeguard peace during times of tension. President Roosevelt also pointed out in the telegrams that the world's anxiety should be the responsibility of German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, a point also praised by public opinion. However, although the President said that this action would not cause the United States to assume any responsibility in international politics, some people believe that the President's telegram has already placed the United States in the British and French camp. Therefore, they are extremely concerned about the consequences of this action. In essence, if war does break out, the President must make a firm decision between providing spiritual and material assistance to Britain and France and directly participating in the war. Responsible individuals in the United States say that German leader Hitler has decided to postpone his response until the 28th of this month, clearly intending to use some time to conduct a vigorous propaganda campaign, aiming to diminish the President's prestige in various countries, even in the Americas. The focus of his attacks will be that genuine American public opinion is truly "isolationist," and that the President's actions are aimed at consolidating his personal position in order to be re-elected for a third term in next year's election. However, well-informed sources believe that the President has already seen through his scheme and is prepared to deal with it, and will even disrupt it if necessary. In addition, the State Department announced that the main result of the President's telegrams is that all countries directly or indirectly threatened by the dictatorial nations' desire for control have strengthened their determination to resist. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

(Washington) According to the State Department last night, the entire Western Hemisphere is now unanimously supporting U.S. President Roosevelt's European peace plan. The State Department has received supportive telegrams from various American countries. Secretary of State Hull is extremely pleased with this, recognizing that American countries share the same feelings about maintaining world peace. Hull stated, "My colleagues and I are extremely delighted by the positive response from the Western Hemisphere and Europe. This clearly shows that all countries recognize the President's action as a practical and necessary contribution to world peace." However, no responses have been received from Germany and Italy so far. It is said that the first to respond to the American President's call for peace were Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Santo Domingo, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Later responses came from Guatemala, Haiti, Paraguay, and the Prime Minister of Canada also sent a telegram to the U.S. President in response, containing "giving the world another chance to save itself from disaster." The Brazilian President's reply stated, "Your call has gained the support of the people of major countries, making you the sole leader of this continent, and the entire Brazilian nation wholeheartedly supports you." (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)

Germany and Italy Consider

Replies to the U.S.

Göring Returns Home from Rome

(Rome) German Aviation Minister General Göring left here for Berlin today after discussing President Roosevelt's telegram calling for peace with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It is expected that Italy's reply will be issued simultaneously with Germany's reply. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

(London) Hitler must wait until after convening the Reichstag to respond to President Roosevelt's suggestion, but has not yet announced his reasons. According to the German constitution, the Reichstag can be convened in a relatively short period of time. However, British and French newspapers all believe that this delay during a tense period can ensure a few days of calm. Regarding the nature of Hitler's reply, there is currently only extremely vague speculation. The Times stated that to imagine that the Axis powers can lose less in a war than others, or that they face less danger of defeat and collapse, seems to be another fallacy. The British government, like the American government, welcomes negotiations to rebuild genuine peace more sincerely than anything else. If Hitler presents a concrete answer, the British people will wait and test it with this spirit. Now, without waiting for concrete evidence of new security from all sides, which everyone can trust, the determination and preparations for the overall situation cannot be relaxed in the slightest. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

(London) Regarding Hitler's decision to postpone his response to Roosevelt's call for two weeks, newspapers here believe that this proves that Hitler recognizes the importance of Roosevelt's declaration. London newspapers speculate that Hitler will propose a counter-proposal in his reply, the content of which requires Southeast Europe and Northeast Europe to be Germany's exclusive sphere of interest, and other countries agree that democratic countries such as Britain, France, and the United States have no right to intervene. The newspapers call this kind of counter-proposal a "non-constructive proposal." (Haitong dispatch, 18th)

(Rome) According to general speculation here, the Axis countries' reply to the U.S. President will reject the two major proposals in the telegram: (1) guaranteeing not to attack any country for ten years; and (2) participating in a world conference. Italy's reply will state that Italy seeks nothing but peace, and that Italy's actions in Abyssinia and Albania were caused by situations that endanger world peace. As for the world conference, Italy will make its participation conditional on its demands on France being satisfied. Greater Italy will regard President Roosevelt's telegram calling for peace as a formality and will not offer any response. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

(London) After U.S. President Roosevelt telegraphed German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday, leader Hitler is scheduled to convene the Reichstag on the 28th of this month to deliver a speech in response. Diplomatic figures here have recently declared that the success or failure of the negotiations between Britain and France regarding the organization of a collective security system will definitely have a significant impact on the content of leader Hitler's speech. Political figures say that Germany and Italy's reactions to President Roosevelt's telegram were originally different. Italian newspapers initially expressed themselves euphemistically, even expressing approval, but German newspapers firmly expressed opposition. After German Aviation Minister General Göring held talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Italian newspapers also leaned towards opposition. However, today's German newspapers' tone has become more moderate, which shows that the German and Italian governments did feel uneasy after receiving the telegram. Hitler must also consider Italy's hesitating attitude. In short, Germany and Italy must decide on a common attitude before the 28th of this month, that is, before leader Hitler delivers his speech. Cabinet members of each country may even hold a meeting to determine the requirements of various policies as preconditions for accepting President Roosevelt's suggestions in the future. In other words, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini must clearly explain his wishes for France, and leader Hitler must explain his intentions regarding the problem of the Free City of Danzig and the problem of colonies. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Senator Explains Foreign Policy

(Rome) During today's Senate session, Senator Bevignani delivered a lengthy speech discussing Italy's foreign policy, strongly stating, "Italy will not participate in any international disarmament agreement until all of Italy's legitimate demands are satisfied." The Rome-Berlin Axis is extremely strong, and "no new alliance can encircle Germany and Italy." This axis is aimed at resisting hostile democracies and Bolshevism, and in addition to Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Anti-Comintern Pact has also been signed by "Manchukuo," Hungary, and Spain, and its power is already extremely large. Regarding British-Italian relations, since Britain has recognized the Italian Empire, bilateral relations should be normalized. As for Franco-Italian relations, the agreement previously signed by both sides in 1935 was declared abolished by our government on November 17 of last year. The colonial problems previously explained by Prime Minister Mussolini also concern the problems of Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal, which must be resolved quickly. However, the initial response proposed by France was rejected. If this attitude remains stubborn, then the gap between the two sides will definitely not be filled. In conclusion, Italy is determined to have peace, but is also determined to strengthen its national power, so that it is loved by friends and feared by enemies. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Germany Now Has Five Generals

(Berlin) After reviewing the troops of the Fifth Army Corps in Austria (formerly Austria) yesterday, leader Hitler issued an order promoting Lieutenant General List, commander of the army corps, to General of the Army. According to the original four generals in Germany, one is the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, von Brauchitsch; the second is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Keitel; the third is the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, Göring; and the fourth is the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Grand Admiral Raeder. From now on, Germany will add one person, with a total of five generals, namely, three Army Generals and one Air Force General and one Naval General. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)

Yugoslavia

Minority Issues

Expected to be Resolved Satisfactorily

Budapest According to telegrams received here from the Yugoslav capital, the issue of the Croat minority in the country has been expected to be resolved since Prime Minister Cvetković personally visited Zagreb and held two talks with Dr. Maček, leader of the Croat community. The methods include the following two points:

(1) Recognizing the Banate of 4.5 million Croats as an autonomous region of the Croat community, still within the scope of the Yugoslav Constitution. (2) The government party and the Croat Peasant Party jointly form a coalition government.

Once the negotiations are over, the long-standing problem can be resolved in accordance with the above two plans. People in South Korea are now expressing their sincere expectations for this matter, believing it to be the beginning of an epoch in South Korean history. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)

Knowledge for Couples

### Basic Principles of the Way of Couples

The way of couples is great, only in healthy bodies; when man is strong and woman is beautiful, love will last forever!

When a woman is old enough, she should marry; when a man is old enough, he should marry. For married men and women, the way of couples is indeed closely related to their personal happiness. Even for unmarried men and women, because being a couple is a process they will inevitably go through in the future, there is no one who is not enthusiastically looking forward to it. The way of couples is really too important for personal happiness! In theory, this knowledge, since it is a common need for everyone, should be universally and openly taught in families and in society. However, everyone avoids talking about it deeply. Therefore, young people with strong curiosity and thirst for knowledge often wander on detours and are swallowed up by darkness and misery. Isn't this a cruel and ugly feudal legacy?

The way of couples should be true, good, and beautiful. In other words, it is also scientific, philosophical, and artistic, because it requires the condition of unity of spirit and flesh. The spirit is indeed about the beautification of the spiritual, and the flesh is about scientific physiology. A pair of adult men and women, because of their physiological maturity, develop a kind of instinctive demand. This instinctive demand is based on physical health. Indeed, when an energetic and strong man marries a healthy and beautiful woman, he develops a deep love instinctively because of the mutual comfort he receives. Therefore, in the coordination of love, in the unity of spirit and flesh, they organize a happy family and give birth to clever children. What happiness this is! Under such circumstances, couples will inevitably influence each other and become one. Even if there are slight differences in ambition and habits, they must have already been subtly changed. Or, differences can be used to compensate for each other's shortcomings and be considered valuable. On the other hand, if one party is inherently weak or even loses their ability, such as a man suffering from masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or from reckless indulgence and overwork after marriage, bursting out with spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, thin sperm and infertility, neurasthenia, etc., then no matter how congenial their marriage is, because the couple's life cannot be fulfilled, their love will inevitably fade, or even become like ice and coal, and various tragedies will be staged in the family! Therefore, couples without love are truly evil and hell in this world! A smart husband, if he wants to remedy this, must fundamentally cure his illness. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhis" is the most effective treatment for the symptoms. This agent can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish the nerves within one day and night after taking it. If you continue to take it, you will definitely be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and it can also achieve the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating. However, if there are nocturnal emissions, you must also take "Himituo's sperm-consolidating tablets" to consolidate the sperm gates and stop leakage, which will be more effective.

Beauty

### Breasts are the Beauty Leaders of Women

— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Ugliness starts with weakness. Beauty comes from health!

Busty breasts and big hips: how can they not be loved?

No one wants the word ugly to be attached to themselves. This is especially true for women, because women's love of beauty and competitiveness are stronger than men's. They will not only be angry and hate you to the bone if someone says they are ugly to their face, but even if someone unintentionally says their shortcomings, they will cry behind their backs and feel ashamed and resentful! If someone actually compares them to others in person - especially during a courtship contest and gives them a "cover photo," then they will really be angry and either get angry or commit suicide! Therefore, Dr. Weneiki, a French beauty expert and gynecologist, said that beauty is a woman's second life, which is true. But how to meet the standard of beauty? According to the doctor, a woman's breasts must be two and a half inches high, soft and elastic, and the state must not sag. The nipples must be fully protruding, and the color band should be purplish red for the best. In addition, they must have plump hips and a graceful waist. If they can meet these conditions, they will not only be like a crane in a flock of chickens in social situations, regarded as fertile soil by the opposite sex and enthusiastically pursued, but also be healthy themselves, because of the strong function of the ovaries. Even if they age, they will not age and will still be charming.

However, what should women do who are weakened by disease and have atrophied breasts? According to the doctor and other famous doctors, taking the ovarian preparation female "Shengzhis" is the most effective treatment, because this agent can not only nourish the ovarian function, promote breast development, but also regulate menstruation, eliminate all uterine obstacles, increase pregnancy ability, beautify and strengthen the body. Because of its amazing medicinal power, it is highly praised by people at home and abroad and is praised as the "woman's treasure." Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases

### Common Diseases Caused by Nocturnal Emission

— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases

Nocturnal emission is a common disease among young people. Because it is a common disease, everyone does not regard it as a disease. Therefore, the serious consequences caused by the loss of treatment for nocturnal emission are really countless, and the spread of the root of the disease, which is ever-changing, is also extremely dangerous! Because the semen in the male body after physiological maturity is actually the main endocrine gland that dominates health and longevity. Its function is to promote developmental function, promote vigorous metabolism, and nourish various nerves. If the semen is abundant, the thinking must be rich, the energy must be majestic, and the future will be bright and happy! If you suffer from nocturnal emission due to masturbation, lust, or overwork, and the frequent nocturnal emission causes sperm to dry up and blood to run out, then the developmental function will be prevented, the new metabolism will also be reduced, and the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves will be destroyed. Then all kinds of diseases such as incomplete development, yellow face and thin skin, short stature, small sexual organs, brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, dreams, tinnitus, dizziness, back pain, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and impotence will follow. Moreover, because of the excessive loss of semen, the semen is thin and lacks sperm, causing infertility. If the youth is like this, not only will he be dying and unable to study and work, but also in the minimum couple life in life, love will be weak and like ice and coal, and there will be no children, causing lifelong regrets!

If you want to remedy this, at this time, you can only take "Himituo's sperm-consolidating tablets" to consolidate the sperm gates and calm the nerves, and nocturnal emission can be cured. If the above symptoms have been caused by nocturnal emission, you must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhis" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you can continue to take it, you will definitely be able to fundamentally cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and it can also achieve the effect of prolonging life. If the patient can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by an expert doctor, and then use electrotherapy, injection, surgery and other targeted therapies, cure can be guaranteed.

### Radical Treatment Method for Turning into Chronic Gonorrhea

Symptoms of Chronic Leukorrhea

There are many characteristics of chronic leukorrhea, and the reduction of pain is also one of them. Other changes increase daily, the poison gas spreads, the disease becomes deeper, and the later the treatment, the more difficult it is. Without a smart and insightful doctor, using the most scientific methods for treatment, it is rare to achieve full success. The number of patients with chronic gonorrhea is increasing, so if a doctor tells a gonorrhea patient that it has turned into chronic, it is like a prisoner hearing a life sentence. This is actually a misunderstanding. Probably the leukorrhea from acute to chronic must be due to the failure to thoroughly cure the acute gonorrhea. Often in the two or three weeks after infection, the treatment is lost or mistreated, the pain gradually decreases, the pus gradually decreases, the urine also changes from turbid to clear, and all the symptoms of acute gonorrhea gradually disappear. In terms of pain relief, it is certainly a temporary physical pleasure for gonorrhea patients, but the internal hidden dangers are very deep.

New Guidelines for Radical Cure

Changing from unbearable pain and practically late to cure acute gonorrhea to stubborn gonorrhea, one must adopt a new method of targeted treatment, and the primary conditions are three. One is to kill bacteria, the second is to filter poison, and the third is to correct the pathological state. The only ideal therapy that meets these guidelines is to use German Lymph-Filtering Galvanic Therapy and inject German Xi's Serum and Quick Sensitivity Surgery to quickly and radically cure it. All chronic gonorrhea prostatitis, cystitis, arthritis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, and urethral stricture can be completely cured within a limited time, and because Lymph-Filtering Galvanic Therapy can filter out gonorrhea toxins, it is especially effective for neuralgia caused by gonorrhea toxins.

### The Disordered Scene in Guangzhou Under Japanese Military Control: Chinese Air Force Advises Citizens to Evacuate; Bandits Assemble to Kill Japanese Patrol Soldiers; Guerrilla Forces, Numerous and Well-Equipped, Infiltrate the City

Hong Kong Dispatch: Regarding the Anglo-Japanese agreement on navigation on the Pearl River, stipulating that a ship should leave the port every two weeks, the "Jinshan" was to sail to Guangzhou once. Recently, the Hong Kong side, in accordance with the agreement, dispatched the "Foshan" to replace the "Jinshan" to the province. After arriving in the province, it still docked at the Taikoo Dockyard bridge, stayed for two days, and returned to Hong Kong. A total of over 1,100 people arrived. Westerners accounted for very few. Whether it was 12-yuan, 8-yuan, or 5-yuan seats, all were fully booked, and the situation was extremely crowded. Here is what passengers reported regarding the recent situation in Guangzhou:

Chinese Air Force Repeatedly Destroys Japanese Airfields

The XX squadrons of the new Chinese Air Force recently received orders to assist the Fourth War Zone's counter-offensive forces in annihilating the enemy. They have repeatedly appeared over the city of Guangzhou. When they arrive, it is often at the crack of dawn. Citizens are often awakened from their dreams by the sound of bombs and anti-aircraft guns. They have destroyed quite a number of military installations operated by the Japanese army in the suburbs of the city. The most effective were the 24th and 25th of last month. It was found that on the morning of the 24th, ten Chinese Air Force planes suddenly flew in. The Japanese army, in a panic, had no time to issue an alarm and immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, extremely flustered. However, the Chinese Air Force soared freely and selected targets, using the most agile methods to descend rapidly from a height of 10,000 feet, continuously dropping more than 20 heavy bombs on the Baiyun and Tianhe airfields. The sound of the explosions shook the entire city. Although the Japanese anti-aircraft guns installed at Shougou Ridge, Baiyun Mountain, and Niulan Hill fired as densely as a string of pearls, they could not threaten the Chinese Air Force. Subsequently, Japanese planes flew in from the Humen direction, attempting to intercept the Chinese Air Force, but the Chinese Air Force had already completed its mission and broke through the encirclement to retreat. In this battle, six or seven Japanese planes at the Baiyun and Tianhe airfields were destroyed. On the 25th, a Chinese Air Force squadron arrived at Humen, bombed the Shijiao Fort, and then flew to the Bai Sha area, dropping six heavy bombs on the small airfield operated by the Japanese army there. The airfield has already been completely destroyed. In addition to bombing Japanese military installations, the Chinese Air Force also distributed leaflets, stating that the various armies were about to launch a major counter-offensive, urging residents in the city to leave the city as soon as possible to avoid complete destruction. The Japanese strictly forbade citizens from picking up these leaflets, and those who violated the order were beaten. However, many leaflets have been read by residents, who inform each other to disguise themselves and leave the city, so the situation is more chaotic than before, and people are panic-stricken, unable to sleep or eat.

Japanese Wounded Soldiers Are Continuously Returned to Guangzhou

After the Japanese army invaded Ronggui and Shunde, fierce battles took place everywhere. The Guangzhou Japanese army hospital corps is exceptionally busy. Electric boats on the Pearl River are frequently moving to transport military supplies, and wounded Japanese officers and soldiers are continuously transported back to Guangzhou from the war zone. The number of casualties is likely not small. Moreover, the Japanese army orders a curfew every day. The curfew area extends from the Tianzi Wharf on the South Bank to the Hanmin Road area, where Japanese soldiers are stationed, prohibiting pedestrians from passing through. The situation is extremely serious, as it is transporting wounded soldiers back to the province from the war zone. Each time the wounded are transported to the province, there are more than a thousand people. Among them, on the 30th of last month, several thousand wounded soldiers were transported back to the province from the West River in dozens of civilian boats, including two senior officers who were also seriously injured, which shows the seriousness of the casualties.

Bandits Are Ferocious and Run Rampant in Broad Daylight

The situation in Guangzhou is even more chaotic than before. Currently, merchants are enduring the pain of resuming business under the threat of the Japanese army, but banditry is rampant in the city, and many shops are being looted. Initially, this was mostly done at night, but recently it has become increasingly violent, running rampant in broad daylight, treating Japanese military police as if they were nothing. In a certain street in western Guangzhou, dozens of bandits seized the ends of the street and carried out a large-scale looting. A Japanese soldier happened to be patrolling and was captured and beheaded by the bandits, who hung his head high on a utility pole before calmly leaving. Merchants are unable to withstand the looting due to the loss of capital, so most have closed down. According to statistics, the number of shops in the city recently has decreased by as much as five-tenths compared to the previous month. Those that have not closed are mostly engaged in multiple businesses. Some funeral shops also sell firewood and rice, and some butcher shops also sell vegetables. The order is extremely chaotic, much like a small market in a remote rural area. Moreover, the rampant bandits are not only targeting shops and residents, but also Japanese people. Foreigners on Shamian are also often patronized. The purpose of the robbery is regardless of the amount. Even those who have two or three cents to enjoy tea in a tea house are robbed. Therefore, residents dare not go out even during the day to avoid being robbed. As a result, the streets, except for two or three main roads, have almost no pedestrians. Even during the day, it is like a ghost market. Recently, Chinese guerrillas have spread inside and outside the city, and the Japanese cannot cope. According to reliable sources, the number of guerrillas lurking from the city to the suburbs is truly astonishing, estimated to be no less than 50,000. The components, in addition to the strong men from the suburbs and the villages of Nanhai and Panyu, also include many who were dispatched or voluntarily joined from Zhongshan, Shunde, Dongguan, Zengcheng, Conghua, and other counties to Guangzhou, engaging in secret work and attacking the Japanese army when the opportunity arises. The attack on the Zhengjin Bank last month was a manifestation of the coordinated actions of the guerrillas from various counties in Guangzhou. Moreover, the guns are new and the ammunition is sufficient. Each launch makes it impossible for the scattered Japanese troops to resist. They are implementing the rear of the Japanese as the front. They do not launch lightly in peacetime. Each launch must have a major purpose and will not stop until it is achieved. The people's armed forces are growing under Japanese forces. The organization is becoming larger day by day and is an indelible fact.

A Small Number of Shops Are Forced to Resume Business

Currently, the Guangzhou restaurants that have resumed business include Dasanyuan, Jinlong, Qimiaozhai (formerly known as Yuanyuan), Jinlun, and other agile shops. They have all resumed business because they were forced by the Japanese army, otherwise, they would be confiscated by the Japanese army and operated on their own. However, there are some unscrupulous merchants who have opened a "Greater China Cuisine" and made wild remarks, promoting welcome to the "Imperial Army." Inside, they hire Japanese women as hostesses. The guerrillas recently warned the investors of the restaurant, and the restaurant asked the Japanese headquarters for protection. The Japanese instructed the puppet police to send plainclothes detectives to investigate. The restaurant is even more panicked, knowing that these secret agents are all bandits, providing insufficient protection and more disturbance.

Planned Household Registration Check Is Too Risky to Proceed

The Japanese army is extremely anxious about the lurking growth of the guerrillas. They have consulted with the puppet organization to check household registration, but they feel that the number of Japanese troops and puppet organizations is not large enough to conduct a large-scale check at the same time. Furthermore, they are worried that the guerrillas will preemptively strike. The Japanese are also making great efforts to attract people from all over to return to the city, using "living and working in peace" as a slogan. They are also afraid that checking household registration will cause unrest in the city, which will make the people even more reluctant to return. All of these are concerns that the Japanese army cannot solve, so the Guangzhou Japanese army often has difficulty sleeping soundly.

Citizens Leaving the City Are Severely Abused

Citizens who took the ship to Hong Kong this time were subjected to harsh abuse by the Japanese when leaving the city. In addition to paying a large sum to the Japanese army headquarters to obtain an exit permit, they also had to go through various inspections. Any slight hesitation would result in the refusal to issue a permit. When boarding the ship, a large team of Japanese soldiers was stationed on the pier to search. Anyone who was not careful would be humiliated. Even Westerners were not spared. A Westerner on the same ship was stopped by the Japanese army when boarding the ship from the suspension bridge. The Westerner questioned them slightly, but the Japanese army ignored him and beat him with fists and feet. The Westerner could do nothing. In short, present-day Guangzhou has been occupied by bandits and Japanese people. Residents who remain are like fish on a chopping board, at the mercy of others. There is nothing more painful than this.

### The 9th Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous Army Is Changed to a Self-Defense Corps; The Troops Desert Twice; The Commander's Will Is Passive

According to someone from Qingpu County, Chen, the commander of the 9th Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, was forced by the 45th Brigade last fall to withdraw from Dianfeng Town and was ordered by the Central Government to be transferred to the Taihu Lake area of Wujiang. At that time, he led his troops across the Sujia Road to Taiping Bridge, where he had a fierce battle with the Japanese army. As a result, the Japanese army suffered 50 or 60 casualties, and three cars were destroyed. After crossing the Sujia Road to Hengshan Town in Wujiang, the town was defended by the 7th Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. Because the two sides had the same position, they established close contact and distributed the major detachments to garrison in the Taihu Lake area. About two months later, Cheng Wanjun, the commander of the 7th Detachment, had secretly been bought by the Japanese and actually surrounded the 9th Detachment, forcing them to surrender to the Japanese army. The officers and soldiers of the detachment all resisted and, in order to preserve their strength, still rushed back to the Sujia Road and ordered Zhou's troops, the most powerful in the detachment, to send Staff Officer Yang to lead the radio station and lead Commander Zhou's troops back to the original defense. Chen, the detachment commander, also took the opportunity to lead the entire team of 700 or 800 people to follow. However, Staff Officer Yang and radio station Guo, and Commander Zhou, had a new intention to rebel, intending to change the designation to the New 9th Detachment, forming an irreconcilable conflict with Chen. However, most of the lower-level officers and soldiers sneaked back with their guns to listen to Chen's orders. When Yang knew that the situation was not good, he fled with his family. Zhou Guo and others had no choice but to return to the team. At that time, Chen was lenient with them and did not hold it against them. However, Zhou secretly contacted the 735th Regiment, a stranded unit of the 45th Brigade, and sent the entire second squadron of his troops to the regiment. Subsequently, he led all of his troops and the radio station to leave. After Chen learned of this, he led all of his troops to pursue them, advancing to the mouth of the Miaohu River. The two sides came into contact. Zhou, with few against the many, was intercepted by Chen's radio station, and about 30 or 40 of Zhou's troops were shot. Guo, the radio station operator, was also killed. However, at this moment, three Japanese warships suddenly arrived and attacked fiercely from the middle. Zhou then led 70 or 80 people and took the opportunity to escape. Chen's troops also retreated to their original defenses with a passive attitude, intending to disband their troops. After repeated persuasion from the gentry of Dianfeng Town, who pointed out that if Chen's troops were disbanded, the locality would suffer, it was agreed to change Chen's troops to a self-defense corps to protect the area and reassure the people. All supplies and salaries would be the responsibility of the District Chief Hu. Chen's troops participated in the anti-war effort, and this matter came to an end.

### The Enemy's Array in Northern Jiangsu Is Disturbed; Pi County Is Recovered Twice; Japanese Puppets Retreat to Guanhuzhen

Pi County, Northern Jiangsu, fell on February 12 after being heavily pressed by the Japanese army. On the 23rd, the county police and the regular army climbed into the city by ladders, killing more than 20 Japanese soldiers, capturing five alive, seizing 11 long and short guns, one machine gun, and three warhorses. The Japanese army then broke through the gate and fled. On the 26th, the Japanese army again assembled mechanized troops to counterattack Pi City. In order to avoid large-scale casualties, the Chinese army safely withdrew from the county seat. Then, County Magistrate Wang Huayun joined forces with the self-defense forces of various districts to counterattack Pi County again. The fierce battle was quite intense. The Japanese army was unable to withstand it and abandoned the city and fled. Thus, the county seat was recovered by the Chinese army for the second time. However, when the Japanese army retreated, they set fire to the county government and the houses of various agencies. After the Chinese army entered the city, they extinguished the fires separately. The Japanese and puppet troops retreated to Guanhuzhen and firmly defended the railway line. County Magistrate Wang led his troops to continuously attack, and there were fierce battles from time to time. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in recognition of the county seat's recovery twice, sent a telegram to County Magistrate Wang on the 8th of this month, commending him and rewarding the troops with 1,000 yuan to show encouragement.

Educational News

### Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education Actively Promotes Compulsory Education, Increasing One Million Yuan in the 28th Year

The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education has spared no effort in wartime educational facilities in recent years, especially focusing on the promotion of compulsory education. It is aware of the difficulty of providing education to those who have dropped out of school due to the war. Although it has tried to arrange for them, it has still failed to provide universal relief. It plans to add many council schools in various counties throughout the province this year to accommodate them. It is now known that the provincial education budget for the 28th year has already begun to be compiled. It is heard that the decision has been made to increase the funds for compulsory education by another 500,000 yuan, and the funds for social education are also planned to be increased by 500,000 yuan, for a total increase of 1 million yuan. Once the budget is compiled and sent to the provincial government for review and approval by the Ministry of Education, it can be implemented.

### Full Text of the Resolutions of the Third National Education Conference (XI): Proposal for the Improvement of Elementary Education (Special Correspondent Yi Sheng from Chongqing)

The elementary education improvement proposal passed by the Third National Education Conference is as follows:

Promoting compulsory education and improving elementary school education are fundamental plans for war construction and national construction. This proposal advocates, on the one hand, extending the length of short-term elementary schools and improving their teaching methods to improve their level, and at the same time completing the basic institutions for promoting compulsory education in various localities, so as to expand in terms of quantity. On the other hand, establishing an elementary school guidance and research system and formulating various facility standards will improve in terms of quality. The methods are as follows:

(I) Regarding the Division of Compulsory Education

1. Extend the length of short-term elementary school studies and "find ways to improve their level": (1) The one-year short-term elementary schools established by various localities for the promotion of compulsory education should gradually extend their length of study to two-year short-term elementary schools or junior elementary schools according to local needs and capabilities. (2) Two-year short-term elementary schools should try to use effective educational methods to improve their level and find ways to connect their curriculum with the curriculum of elementary schools at all levels.

2. Complete the grassroots institutions for establishing elementary schools in various localities: Each province, city, and county should complete the establishment of the grassroots institutions for elementary schools in the 28th year in accordance with the "Measures for the Division of Elementary School Districts in Cities and Counties" promulgated by the Ministry of Education. However, if a province, city, or county has special circumstances, it may formulate another method applicable to the locality and submit it to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation. (1) Each county and city should, in a short period of time, delineate elementary school districts, with one bao to several bao, or one street or one village, with a population of about 1,000 people, as an elementary school district, as the most grassroots institution for establishing a two-year short-term elementary school. (2) Each county and city should also delineate one lianbao to several lianbao, or one township (town) to several townships, with ten to twenty elementary school districts, as a joint elementary school district, and establish a four-year junior elementary school in each district, as the central elementary school for the short-term elementary schools in each elementary school district. (3) Each county and city should also delineate ten joint elementary school districts (i.e., autonomous regions) as a county school district. Establish a six-year elementary school in each county school district, as the central elementary school for the four-year elementary schools in the joint elementary school districts. (4) If each province has grounds to create a grassroots institution for establishing elementary schools that is suitable for the local province based on the above principles and the actual situation of the province, the Ministry of Education may approve a flexible approach, but it must first be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval before implementation. (5) Except for the war zone provinces, which may postpone the delineation and establishment of grassroots institutions such as elementary school districts, the rear provinces must all complete them in the 28th year.

3. Improve the organization of compulsory education committees at all levels: (1) Compulsory education committees at all levels should strengthen their organization so that they can effectively assume the technical aspects of supervision, editing, research, experimentation, investigation, and publicity. (2) Compulsory education committees at all levels should fully strengthen the organization of the supervision and management of funds, so as to effectively exercise their powers and attach importance to compulsory education funds.

4. Train compulsory education teachers and compulsory education administrative personnel: (1) The training of compulsory education teachers in each province and city in the future should be based on the training of normal schools and simplified normal school departments. (2) When there is a shortage of compulsory education teachers in each province and city, graduates of junior high schools or above and those with equivalent academic qualifications may be recruited and trained as substitute teachers. (3) Each province, county, and city should stipulate further education measures for short-term elementary school teachers and supervise their implementation. (4) The treatment of short-term elementary school teachers should be properly standardized according to local living conditions so that they can serve with peace of mind. (5) Short-term elementary school substitute teachers with excellent results may be changed to formal teachers with the approval of the competent education administrative agency. (6) Each province should convene training courses or discussion meetings for administrative personnel in charge of compulsory education in various counties and cities from time to time.

5. Raise compulsory education funds: (1) The central compulsory education subsidy should still be expanded year by year according to the original plan and fully disbursed on schedule, and should not be used for other purposes.

### Finance: Tianjin and Hong Kong Banks are Both Buying - Cash Reverses and Rises - Closing at 2,080 Yuan

Yesterday's spot market for gold bars showed a narrow range of fluctuation, with a difference of only five yuan throughout the day. The situation shifted from weak to tight. Although a certain silver shop initially purchased on behalf of Hong Kong banks, the cash firms frequently sold, so the underlying trend was slightly weak. Later, Tianjin and Xiamen banks suddenly followed the Hong Kong banks in purchasing, which led to a tighter and steadier market. The price rose to a high of 2,080 yuan at the close of the day, resulting in a gain of three yuan. Due to local banks' wait-and-see attitude, trading was unusually light, with only 450 taels traded. Silver jewelry remained unchanged, while customs gold and Sino-British pure gold rose slightly.

Gold Bars Rise Three Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened at 2,077 yuan due to strong selling interest from cash firms, but most buyers remained on the sidelines. Although the price dropped to 75 yuan, it was still difficult to find a counterparty. Around 10:00 AM, a certain silver shop suddenly purchased at a lower price on behalf of Hong Kong banks, which led to a transaction. The cash firms sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop, with the opening price at 2,075 yuan, two yuan lower than yesterday afternoon's closing price. After the opening, a certain silver shop absorbed a total of 70 taels from the cash firms at the same price. After this, the cash firms stopped selling and waited and watched, and a certain gold firm and securities firms successively purchased, so the underlying trend turned firm. A certain gold firm bought 50 taels from a fellow firm at a price of 76 yuan, and then a securities firm bought 30 taels from a money exchange firm at the same price. Later, a money exchange firm bought 50 taels from a silver shop at a price of 77 yuan, and a securities firm bought another 50 taels from a silver shop at 78 yuan. Soon, a money exchange firm bought 50 taels from a silver shop at 80 yuan. It was already 11:30 AM, but buyers still wanted to buy at 80 yuan, while sellers were only willing to supply at 81 yuan. The market did not open until noon, so the noon closing price was still 80 yuan. In the afternoon, supply and demand became even scarcer, leading to a more stagnant market. Only 50 taels were traded between gold firms at a price of 80 yuan, leading to the evening closing price remaining at 2,080 yuan. The result was a gain of three yuan compared to yesterday afternoon's closing price. The selling price of the cash firms' own-brand gold was 2,085 yuan, and the buying price was 2,075 yuan. The current bid price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and no transactions were made.

### Securities: Customs Foreign Debt Continues to Fall, Domestic Debt Also Experiences Turbulence

Yesterday's market situation for securities was that the market suddenly rebounded in the morning due to rumors, but the sellers were all floating profits, and the big players were mostly absorbing at low prices. However, the short sellers, due to the severe pressure, were thinking of selling again, intending to create a terror situation, such as Runli's brave selling, but the long side was extremely stable, because the rumors were absolutely inaccurate. Therefore, the rebound suddenly rose in the afternoon. This trend is favorable to the long side, because once setbacks, and then returned to high, the trend is more firm. Yesterday's experience was that the market was initially firm, and then Runli and No. 5 sold the most, and Hongda, Lianhe, Yuankang and other numbers successively sold, thinking that the rumors could be speculated. Who knows that the big players absorbed at low prices, and the stomach was extremely healthy. Dafeng bought the most, and Tongsheng, Tongkang, Zhenkang, and Hengfu all bought. The morning result was still pressured by Runli by a small number of corners to a yuan. After a thousand, the seller was scarce, only No. 2, No. 5 and No. 70 slightly supplied. Yongkang, Yongfeng, Defu, and Fuchun all bought. The rumors stopped suddenly, and the retail short sellers were still stubbornly resisting. The afternoon result has returned to three or four corners. Summing up the market price, slightly smaller four or five corners, but the European situation has not yet dissipated, and the long side is not elated. Ninety-six is still very firm, and the total number of transactions is estimated to be around 1.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Stock market prices, 140 shares of Hanzhi Ping shares were traded, the price was 25 yuan 3 jiao 2 fen and a half

Public business office, the stock market is unusually heavy, and more changes are also quite falling.

London British merchants Far East companies stock market prices on the 17th of this month (Monday), only HSBC Bank shares continued to fall by half a pound, the price of British registered shares was 80 pounds, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms' Silk Sales are Extremely Prosperous - White Factories' Transactions Reach 300 Loads - Silk Prices Rise Another 10 Yuan

Yesterday's international silk market fluctuated slightly. In Lyon, white silk prices rose 5.5 francs, Shanghai silk A-grade rose 4.5 francs, and B-grade rose 3 francs, making it the firmest market. Yokohama silk spot prices rose 8 yuan, and forward prices fell 11 yuan, indicating a discrepancy between near and far terms. New York's Chinese and Japanese raw silk were sold at the original prices, and the Reuters wire for near futures was 2.26 yuan, down 9 cents from the previous day. This may be a telegraphic error, as the current silk market does not seem to be in danger of a sharp drop. Let's see what happens today. New York's distant futures are down only half a point, so they are still stable. According to the recent situation in the international silk market, it can be described as steady and progressive, so it is predicted that silk prices still have the potential to rise further. This point can be confirmed by the prosperous sales of silk by foreign firms in Shanghai yesterday.

Since the recent rise in silk prices, the Shanghai silk market has adopted a prudent attitude due to the past operational errors, resulting in a slow rise in Shanghai silk prices. Therefore, it is close to the foreign firms, and foreign sales have been developing day by day for the past four or five days. Silk prices have been rising by 10 yuan per day, and this normal development has led to the grand transactions yesterday. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson, Dachan, Liana, and others all made progress. White factory 7-8 points 20-22 striped, the price of 1,700 yuan, a total of 300 loads, can be described as extremely prosperous. Silk prices rose only 10 yuan compared to the previous day. At present, both domestic and foreign silk markets undoubtedly have the potential to rise further, but one point seems to be worth noting, that is, the general public is now overly optimistic, thinking that the current Japanese and American silk prices have already exceeded the previous high records, and only the Shanghai silk market, although silk transactions are now booming, is still far from the previous record of 1,950 yuan. This mentality may cause a recurrence of the previous mistakes, but a review of the previous soaring facts can reveal the unreasonableness of this argument. In the middle of the previous month, when Shanghai user silk prices were sold at 1,950 yuan, it was the day when the white factory B-grade 7-8 points issued an external telegraph price of 1,715 yuan, with no response. Therefore, the previous high price record in Shanghai cannot be compared with today's export silk prices, which is undoubtedly questionable. In short, observing the current development of silk prices, it is considered that there is still a potential for temporary rise, but it is not easy to expect the recurrence of 1,950 yuan. This point, the recent silence of the user silk market, and the fact that the eating price is about 50 yuan lower than that of the foreign firms, can also be used to get a glimpse of the general trend of silk prices in the future. Also, yesterday 50 pieces of Huzhou silk were shipped to Europe.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Rapid Rise in Price Led to a Halt in Export Sales - 20-Count Double Horse Yarn Fell Back by 2 Yuan - Sales in Japanese Yarn Guerrilla Areas Also Decreased

The wildly soaring yarn market of the previous day showed a slight leveling off yesterday. At the same time, the number of customers bringing their own paths was not as large as yesterday, and the popularity was not as hot as in the past. In fact, it has risen from the low price before the Spring Festival closure by 36, 7 yuan to 40 yuan. Thinking about the problem of cotton yarn itself, it can be temporarily concluded. However, according to the discussion of a part of the current merchants, the future is still rising, saying that one is that this time they have seen the low price rise, supported by the actual needs of South China, and the second is that the inland transport line, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi road was interrupted late, and it has been changed to be transported from Shantou inland. Yarn sales are becoming more and more prosperous, and the inventory has been emptied a lot, so the amount of absorption is still not willing to give up easily. Therefore, yesterday's trend mostly presented a situation of big rise and small return, and the fundamental key is still thinking about the actual position.

The situation of the current yarn, the morning opening, continued to rise on the surplus of the previous day, the opening price increased by one yuan, the price of 20-count Double Horse was 404 yuan, and the stack price was 398 yuan and a half. However, the customer's sales stomach was stagnant and unmoved due to the crazy rise in the previous day. As for the general floating households, in view of the current yarn turning stagnant, the intention of selling off is more and more sluggish, and the market suddenly saw a weak, step by step falling back, Double Horse was done to 400 yuan, and the stack price was 396 yuan. By the time of closing, the long-term players and others came to cheapen the goods, and then recovered by one yuan, to 401 yuan and a half, but most of the transactions were between the same firms. As a result, the total amount of clouds bought by the various firms throughout the day was 1,852 packages, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse brand and the big daughter brand fell by one and a half to two yuan compared with the previous day. The remaining 32-count and 42-count still rose by 23 yuan and so on. Zhenhua Factory opened 40 yuan, and Li Tai Factory opened 145 packages of 20-count Xing Lion, the price was 377 yuan. Yesterday, 750 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin. The amount of cloud bought by each firm is listed on the left.

The Japanese yarn market situation turned weak, because the quality needs were more sluggish, because the consumption in the guerrilla area was reduced, but the hearts of the local people were still stalwart, and the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn for this month was 359 yuan, and there was not much up and down with the previous day.

### National Cotton Supply Cut Off; Flower Firms to Change to Bulk Buying, Purchasing Large Quantities of "Ping Nie Er" to Fill Demand for "Huoji" Cotton

Foreign cotton prices, especially in the New York cotton market, have been falling for several days. Industry insiders are closely watching for news from Washington regarding cotton loans, but no announcement has been made, causing deep concern about the release of cotton and the non-execution of export subsidies, all due to the government's many difficulties. Yesterday, there were suspicions that the government's cotton industry plan might have been slightly altered. With the May delivery period in New York approaching and the Liverpool cotton market being unusually firm, many old short positions were heavily covered. May delivery rose by four British pounds, Indian cotton (including predictions) rose by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton rose by over ten British pounds, all reflecting an increase in legal tender cotton prices. American and Brazilian cotton each rose by 80 cents per picul, Indian cotton by 70 cents, and Egyptian cotton by over 60 cents.

In Shanghai, foreign cotton trading firms are shifting to bulk buying due to the cutoff of national cotton supplies. They have been placing large orders for Indian "Xiao Guo Er" cotton, which has fibers similar to "Huoji," but with a lower color grade. These firms plan to use this cotton as a substitute for "Huoji" cotton after it arrives. Yesterday, foreign cotton trading at various factories was particularly quiet. The converted factory prices for foreign cotton yesterday are as follows:

The local cotton business, which had been picking up, faced a deadlock as prices rose and supplies were cut off. Chinese and foreign factories have mostly switched to Indian and British cotton as replacements. No goods are arriving from Northern Jiangsu because several ports are affected by guerrilla warfare, and ships have temporarily suspended operations, leading to no supply. Only one transaction of 200 bales of spot cotton was completed among industry peers yesterday, with "Huoji" cotton priced at 70.05 yuan, cash on delivery. No other transactions were reported.

### Dried Goods: "Yuan Zhi" Lacking, Sudden Rise of 3 Yuan

"Jinshan Zhi" is experiencing a sudden tightening of the market due to scarce arrivals. Yesterday, stores in the Southern District opened with over sixty cases of "Yuan Zhi," with demand exceeding supply, causing a price increase of two to three yuan. High-grade rose to 64 yuan, while secondary grades ranged from 63.30 yuan to 60.40 yuan, with wholesale prices also increasing accordingly.

### Grains: Local Flour Still Mostly Sold to the North, Foreign Flour Prices Soar Amidst European Tensions

Local flour mills reported stable conditions for their current flour inventories. After raising factory prices by five cents the previous day, trade with local customers was not sluggish due to the higher prices. Mill officials indicated a continued intention to raise prices due to recent dangerous international developments and firm foreign market prices. However, foreign flour prices have stabilized after the increase, and some goods are being returned to the market, making it difficult for the market to improve significantly in the short term. As a result, wholesale prices remained firm at 4.45 yuan. Retail sales of 40,000 to 50,000 bags were reported, including batches of No. 4 flour and No. 5 white bag flour, priced at 4.20 yuan and 3.80 yuan, respectively. Sales remained primarily to Northern merchants, followed by Southern merchants and local vendors. Exports of flour totaled 52,000 bags to Tianjin and 4,500 bags to Yantai yesterday.

Foreign Flour

Foreign flour trading continued to be quiet yesterday. Arrivals of American and Australian flour have been limited in recent days. Amidst the dangerous situation in Europe, the prospects for foreign flour and wheat are promising. Therefore, those holding foreign flour in the market are reluctant to sell it easily, while buyers are not urgently in need, leading to a stalemate. As a result, transactions are sporadic, with the general price remaining at 4.20 yuan in cash. High-end brands increased by 5 to 10 cents. Transactions of over 10,000 bags were reported.

### Foreign and Local "Xian" Rice Prices Decline

Although whole batches of "Ke Xian" rice have been arriving recently, sporadic supplies have not been cut off. Over 2,000 bags of various "Xian" rice from Anhui arrived in the market yesterday, but sales remained limited to local vendors. Yesterday's transactions totaled over 1,000 bags. High-quality rice maintained its original price, while medium and lower-quality rice fell by 5 to 10 cents. Nanjing high-grade "Xian" rice was priced at 13 yuan, while ordinary rice was only 12.30 to 12.40 yuan. High-grade "Wu Xian" rice was 12.80 to 12.90 yuan, "Guan Guan" rice was around 12 yuan, and "Yi Xian" rice was only 11.60 to 11.70 yuan. Saigon rice also fell slightly by 5 cents, with ordinary rice selling for only 17.20 yuan. High-quality old rice was still selling for 17.40 to 17.50 yuan.

### Local Rice Prices Remain Stable Despite Sufficient Inventory

After the ban on transporting rice from Changshu and Wuxi areas from January 15th onward, these areas have been completely cut off, except for Changzhou, which sees one or two trucks arriving per day. Rice prices have remained unchanged during this period, with only small amounts of early and late rice from Southern Jiangsu and areas around Nantong arriving in Shanghai. This situation has a significant impact on the food supply in Shanghai and should be addressed. However, the market in Shanghai has seen fluctuations of only 10 to 20 cents in recent months, thanks to the ample inventory. According to reports from the Price Stabilization Association, there are still over 600,000 bags in stock. Moreover, consumers, except for wholesalers, are mostly small-scale buyers, followed by retailers, so demand is not high. At the same time, speculators are less active due to the lack of price changes. Therefore, although only twelve trucks of river-bottom rice and a little over 2,000 bags of "Sutong" rice arrived yesterday, the market remains stable. Prices for thick and thin "Jing" rice, as well as "Du Yang Jian," "Bu Jian," and "Bian Yuan" rice, have seen little change.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Prices Soar to Unprecedented Levels in Sixty Years; Raw Oil at 1.2 Yuan per Jin, Also an All-Time High

The upward trend in soybean oil prices shows no sign of stopping. The highest recorded price for soybean oil in Dalian reached 45 yuan per barrel, while bleached soybean oil reached 47.5 yuan. "Lianqi" small barrel oil rose by 1.9 yuan, a shocking increase unseen in the last sixty years. Yesterday, over 300 barrels of Dalian oil were traded at prices ranging from 44.30 yuan to 45 yuan. 30 barrels of bleached soybean oil were traded at 47.5 yuan. 100 pieces of "Lianqi" small barrel oil traded at 43.4 yuan, 150 pieces of large barrel oil traded at 42.3 yuan, and 200 pieces of "Yantaiqi" oil traded at 34 yuan. 100 "dan" of "Dayou" factory oil traded at prices ranging from 34.80 to 35 yuan. Peanut oil prices were slightly stable, with 20 pieces of "Jiaozhou" oil trading at the original price of 39 yuan, 30 pieces of land-transported oil trading at 38.5 yuan, and 10 pieces of "Yantai" oil trading at 40 yuan.

Retail prices for raw oil are 1.2 yuan for 2.6 "jin", and soybean oil is 1.2 yuan for 2.12 "jin", but prices may increase further today. This is due to manipulation by Japanese merchants.

### Miscellaneous Grains: April Soybean Futures Temporarily Exempted by 30%

Dalian soybeans, April futures are temporarily exempted by 30% according to Japanese merchants, but the relaxation is limited to the period of control, and the original contract must still be fulfilled after the ban is lifted.  Also, the buyer will bear the increased export fees from Dalian, resulting in endless disputes. Currently, most of the market is empty buying and selling, and they are constantly making up for each other, so there have been few major changes in the market recently.  There were quite a few transactions yesterday, with about twelve or three trucks traded, priced at 8.70 to 8.80 yuan. However, as spot soybeans are still subject to contract deliveries after the ban is lifted (there is hope for lifting the ban), floating profits are quickly appearing, and prices have fallen from 9 yuan to 8.80 yuan, a further drop of 35 cents from the previous day. More than a dozen trucks were traded, and other beans were unaffected. More than 300 bags of Chongming "Sha Huang" were priced at 9 to 9.2 yuan, and 50 bags of Pudong "Du Dou" were priced at 9.95 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Factories Accepting Huge Orders for Bleached Grey Cloth, Fine Cloth Production to Be Reduced; Industry Enthusiastic About Stockpiling

National Cloth

White fine cloth, fine twill, with various cloth factories already accepting huge orders for printed, dyed, and flannelette grey cloth, the future production volume will inevitably be greatly reduced, so the selling price is becoming increasingly tight. Over one hundred bags of fine cloth and fine twill were purchased by dye factories, and over two hundred bags of stock were absorbed by inside and outside stockholders. Yih Wah coarse cloth still offers a lower price, and the industry is still keen on stockpiling. The morning market sold over one hundred bags of loose-end goods at a discount of 5 to 10 cents compared to the market price, then purchased four hundred more pieces of various heavy and light weights as the appetite was not satisfied. Wenzhou merchants also bought more than one hundred pieces, and Hua factories also sold nearly one hundred pieces. The market for bleached and dyed fabrics was stable yesterday, with fall goods rising faster. The factory has already started selling inventory of woolen cloth and serge to customers on this street, and the market has continued to rise due to continued demand. Currently, Hongzhang Three Sheep serge has increased from 42.25 cents to the current market price of 46.5 cents, with very active sales. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants are busy packing and sending parcels day and night, and new sources are being purchased one after another. Transactions of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and other goods reached a total of 400 pieces. Guangdong merchants added more than 4,000 pieces of colored twill and 5,000 to 6,000 pieces of standard blue cloth and colored cloth.

Eastern Cloth

The rise of fine cloth and fine twill was too violent, and the reaction was also strong. Yesterday, due to the short sales in the market, the selling prices were chaotic. Fine cloth dropped by 20 cents per bolt, and fine twill dropped by 5 cents. However, dyeing and sales on this street are still lively, and transactions continue to reach a thousand pieces. Foreign firms did not open up, and the general consensus in the industry is still bullish.

Exports

On the 18th, 220 pieces of piece goods were transported to Tianjin, and 85 pieces were transported to Yantai.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Price Increases Stabilize

The sugar market trend remained firm yesterday. The association set the price for No. 24 coarse white, with goods in local warehouses rising another 10 cents, trading at 26.3 yuan. Transshipment goods rose by the same amount, at 18.15 yuan, with 200 bags sold. Taitoo "Che Bai B" mark, goods in the western warehouses became slightly tighter. Chao merchants opened the price for Huanggang Qing at 14.85 yuan, and the next grade at 14.65 yuan, and high-grade "Bannan" Qing at 14.2 yuan, with a total of two to three hundred bags traded.

### Medicinal Materials: Scarce Supplies from Sichuan and Yangtze River; "Banxia" Rises

Sichuan "Banxia," with traffic blocked in Sichuan and supplies relying only on postal deliveries, arrivals are extremely rare. The only substitute is Qingjiang goods, but the selling price must be 40 to 50 yuan lower. However, due to the long-term lack of arrivals, the market has gradually risen. Currently, Qingjiang selected grade is 130 yuan, and mixed grade is 115 to 120 yuan. Used "Banxia" is already priced as high as 180 yuan.

23 tons of gallnut were transported to France and Germany yesterday.

### Hardware: Wire Sales Still Active

Wire trading has been very smooth recently due to purchases from foreign nail factories and construction gangs. Unfortunately, new goods have not yet been loaded, resulting in concerns about shortages in the market. Therefore, the standard is firm, and small-flower-patterned wire is selling for 15.4 yuan per "dan," which is 20 to 50 cents higher than the previous market price. It was found yesterday that iron shops such as North Suzhou Road opened up more than 200 tons. As for a type of head-end goods, it has also been very firm recently due to the thinness of the market goods, and the market atmosphere is also very strong. The market price is quoted at 12 to 13 yuan per "dan." It was found yesterday that as many as six to seven hundred "dan" were traded, purchased by construction gangs, and retail transactions at stores are still good.

To all newspaper offices throughout the country, for the perusal of compatriots throughout the country. The War of Resistance has entered its final stage, and final victory is in sight.

### Japanese Warships Harass Zhenhai, Reportedly Fired Over Ten Shells, Escaped After Fortified Response

It is reported that Zhenhai Harbor was shelled by Japanese warships again at 2:00 PM on the 15th, firing over ten shells. After the forts responded with several shots, the Japanese ships hurriedly left the waters of Qili Island outside the harbor. In addition, Japanese warships also came to the waters of Longshan outside Zhenhai Harbor a month ago, firing two shots before escaping. This news has not been confirmed in Shanghai. In addition, Japanese warships have also been spotted in the waters of Damao Mountain off Chuanshan in Dinghai County and have now left.

### General Headquarters Approves Shipment of Wheat to Ningbo, Ende Ship Released Directly to Ningbo Yesterday, Passengers from the Liberpool Transferred Back to Homeland by the Hanna, Portuguese Ships Still Detained, No Progress

The Italian Sino-Italian Shipping Company, previously commissioned by the German Taifeng Flour Mill in Ningbo, was transporting American wheat to Ningbo to help the people's food supply. The first batch of wheat, totaling 2,000 tons, had been loaded and was about to set sail when the port of Zhenhai was blocked, making it impossible to ship. The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and others requested the Ningbo Defense Command to facilitate imports. Yesterday afternoon, a telegram came from Ningbo, stating that the wheat transportation case had been approved by the General Headquarters. The original telegram is as follows: (omitted above) "Approved the Chamber of Commerce to notify Taifeng Factory that the Commander-in-Chief has ordered the opening of the Taifeng Factory to import purchased wheat.

It is reported that a part of them were planning to go to Ningbo via Chuanshan, and the ship will return to Shanghai after arriving in Dinghai and will be changed to the Shanghai-Ningbo route.

Tang Xue San Ships Continue to Unload Goods

In addition to more than 600 pieces of fresh eggs that had been completely unloaded the day before, foreign miscellaneous goods, north-south goods, etc., were also unloaded yesterday, but due to the lack of large barges, they could not be unloaded all at once. As for the other detained merchant ships, there has been no progress in negotiations, and the goods are still not allowed to be unloaded. It is reported that all Portuguese merchants have expressed extreme indignation at this.

No News of Detained Portuguese Ships

Rickshaw Rent Increase Dispute

Rickshaw Owners Petition for Rent Increase, Authorities Have Not Yet Officially Accepted

The Zi Lin Report states that a dispute has arisen between rickshaw owners in Shanghai. The rickshaw owners have petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council for a 20% increase in fares. The rickshaw pullers are not willing to be left behind and have also listed several reasons to demand a 30% fare reduction. Both parties are closely watching the official reaction to this movement. The rickshaw owners have recently held several meetings to discuss the issue of rent increases and have petitioned the Municipal Council, but the Municipal Council has not yet officially accepted this petition. Many rickshaw pullers have formed a group and petitioned the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association to help them get a fare reduction.

### Cattle, Sheep and Fresh Pork Industries Sternly Refuse to Participate in the Puppet "Market" – Those Who Participate Privately Have Been Warned – A City-Wide Strike Will Occur if the Environment Worsens

Apart from the temporary location of the puppet "Livestock Market" at 52 Yuezhou Road in the Public Concession, the General Office is also renting 40 Suzhou Road North. Since the "Market" opened on the 15th of this month, the cattle and sheep, fresh pork, chicken and duck, and other industries have firmly opposed and refused to participate. Therefore, transactions are impossible. Although the Japanese puppets are using a few shameless merchants to prop up the market, it remains deserted from morning till night and business is difficult. According to a reporter from the Modern News Agency, the general manager of the puppet "Market" is a puppet official, and the deputy manager is a Chinese named Wang Zhiqiang. When asked, various trade associations claimed that there was no such person among their members.

Attempting to Compile Exorbitant Commissions

It is also learned that the purpose of the Japanese puppets in organizing the puppet "Market" this time is entirely to attempt to control transportation and sales. They forcibly require inland merchants to transport all purchased livestock to Shanghai on Russian or Japanese ships. Goods must be sold through the "Market" before they can be picked up, and exorbitant commissions will be charged: ten yuan per head of cattle, two yuan per pig, and one dime per chicken, duck, or goose. The viciousness of their extortion methods is no different from scraping the bone for marrow or draining the pond to catch all the fish.

All Resolved to Not Participate

All livestock industry colleagues have a very firm attitude towards the puppet "Livestock Market." In addition to the fresh pork industry in the city having issued a joint declaration expressing their vow to never yield, it is heard that the cattle and sheep industry colleagues are also unanimously and strongly opposed, and have stated that if the environment worsens, they will decide to go on a city-wide strike. They would rather sacrifice business than bow to the Japanese puppets. It is also heard that some scoundrels in the industry participated privately. They have received warnings from patriotic organizations urging them to withdraw as soon as possible. The chicken and duck industry has also expressed the same sentiment. Furthermore, the fresh pork industry has identified a small number of member firms who have participated, and are currently discussing measures to deal with them.

Fresh Pork Transported to Shanghai Forced to Pay Fees

According to the New Sound News Agency, the Changshun and other 50 fresh pork businesses in Shanghai, after issuing a joint declaration and taking an oath, declaring their position to never participate in any illegal organization, yesterday, hundreds of fresh pigs transported to Shanghai by train were detained by the so-called "Livestock Market" in Hongkou and extorted for subsidies. Pig merchants, because fresh pigs are perishable goods and cannot be delayed, were forced to pay one yuan and one dime per head. The market issued a certificate stating that the said number of fresh pigs had completed the correct procedures and requested that military police along the way verify and release them, etc. However, there was no mention of the amount of money received, nor the name of the responsible person. Now, after being oppressed in this way, fresh pork merchants are extremely indignant and unanimously resolutely oppose it. Some have decided not to transport fresh pigs to Shanghai anymore. If so, there is a danger that the city's meat supply will be cut off.

Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council

Commends the Shanghai Volunteer Corps

Sacrificing Their Own Time, Enthusiastically Serving the Public

Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, F.C. Maitland, inspected the Public Concession Shanghai Volunteer Corps last Sunday, and expressed his appreciation for the spirit of the members at all levels. Maitland has sent a letter to the commander of the corps, Xiang Peiyi, stating that "All members of the Volunteer Corps sacrifice their own time for the benefit of the public and enthusiastically serve the public, for which the public should be grateful."

### Trucks End-to-End, Post Office Parcels Piled Up Like Mountains – More and More Are Sent to Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan – Post Office Staff Work Through the Night

According to the Shanghai Times, the number of parcels received by the Shanghai General Post Office yesterday (the 17th) for shipment to Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces was unprecedented. This is because goods on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway have been congested and unable to be transported for 40 days. At the same time, a large number of parcels sent from home and abroad have also arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Transportation Department of the Post Office was extremely busy. Hundreds of post office staff and coolies were busy checking parcels, moving them into post office warehouses, and loading them onto trucks.

Parcel Trucks

were end-to-end, driving from the warehouse to the Jianghai Customs, where customs inspectors inspected the parcels before loading them onto ships bound for Haiphong. Thousands of parcels were piled up around the entrance to the General Office, blocking the road. The amount of mail piled up on both sides of Suzhou Road North between Sichuan Road Bridge and Jiangxi Road Bridge was continuous, showing the sheer volume of postal items. According to inquiries at the Parcel Department yesterday, these parcels contain educational supplies, Chinese medicinal materials, cotton fabrics, cosmetics, and foreign textbooks for university

students in the interior.

An employee in the Parcel Department said that the demand for stationery and other educational supplies in various inland cities is very high. A school exercise book that can be purchased for one dime in Shanghai costs five dimes in Chongqing. The price of ink in Chongqing, Kunming, and Guiyang is also very expensive. A small bottle of ordinary domestic ink retails for about five dimes. Although the Chinese government prohibits the transport of luxury goods such as cosmetics, a large number of cosmetics are waiting to be transported to Kunming and distributed to other cities in the interior. However, most of the parcels are cotton fabrics such as towels and bed blankets.

Shipment to Haiphong

was halted for 40 days and resumed yesterday. As of yesterday evening, customs officers had inspected approximately 8,000 parcels. Given the large number of parcels still stored in the post office warehouse, it is heard that the staff of the Parcel Department and the Transportation Department may work until midnight every night for over a week to ship these parcels out. However, local merchants still deliver more parcels to the post office for shipment to the interior every day. Currently, only a few ships sail directly from Shanghai to Haiphong, each ship limited to carrying 1,000 parcels. However,

larger ships

can carry about 2,000 parcels each time. The Haiphong post office is quite small and, after the fall of Guangzhou, is unable to cope with the large volume of freight transiting through Vietnam. Moreover, the railway from Haiphong to Hanoi to Kunming is a single track and can only transport a few hundred tons of goods per day, further increasing the difficulty. It is heard that the Haiphong postal authorities have requested the Shanghai postal authorities to telegraph in advance the number of parcels shipped to that location each day to avoid railway traffic

congestion.

According to a rough estimate by Parcel Department personnel, the number of parcels stored in the post office engine room is between 50,000 and 100,000. It is expected that local merchants will deliver even more parcels to the post office for shipment. Parcels sent to Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces have already been shipped out yesterday, and a large number of parcels sent from home and abroad have also been shipped into the post office and stored in warehouses.

### Puppet Troops in Tangkou Mutiny – Guerrilla Forces Seize Eight Machine Guns – More Than 200 Puppet Troops Act as Internal Allies in Combat

At 6:00 AM on the 14th of this month, more than 1,000 Chinese guerrilla soldiers detoured from Punan to Lujiahui and contacted the local guerrilla forces. They attacked the puppet First Army garrison in Tangkou in four routes, passing through Zhagang and other places. The Chinese army advanced to Tangkou at 8:00 AM and liaised in advance with a mutinying unit of the puppet "army."

Firing Guns as a Signal

Internal and external attacks were coordinated. Upon reaching the destination, more than 200 puppet "soldiers" surrendered to the Chinese army and captured the three battalion commanders of the puppet "army." More than 200 puppet "soldiers" attempted to resist stubbornly and were killed. The Japanese puppets in Zhoupu Yangsi Bridge rushed to the rescue, but unexpectedly were completely surrounded by the Chinese army.

Fierce Fighting on Both Sides

lasted for a day and night. By 5:00 AM on the 15th, the Japanese puppet army was about to be completely annihilated, so they requested reinforcements from all sides. Even the bandit "puppet" Xu Hongfa's troops were urgently deployed to support them with 300 men. Japanese warships in the Pujiang River indiscriminately fired artillery shells and even landed marines to assist in the battle, finally rescuing the remnants. The fighting ceased at about 7:00 AM. In this battle, the guerrilla forces captured

140 Rifles

eight light machine guns, and captured dozens of puppet "battalion commanders" and squad leaders. Because the guerrilla forces had no fortifications to defend, they moved to the area south of Luhui, near Tairibashi and Jinhuibashi, to hold their ground. At dawn yesterday morning, the Japanese army dispatched 70-80 soldiers, covered by warships, to

land in Zhagang,

Blockading Old Zhagang (leading to Luhui New Market) and Jinhui Port (leading to Jinhui Bridge) waterways. Therefore, the boats sailing to Zhagang New Market and Jinhui Bridge yesterday morning were forced to return upon arriving at the mouth of Zhagang. Transportation between Shangzhaqi, Xinshangjin, and Jinhui was completely cut off.

### Claiming to Be the "Patriotic National Salvation Corps" – Intimidating Foreign Business Newspaper – Many English, American, and Chinese Newspapers Received These Letters – The Wording Was Intimidating and the Content Was Absurd

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, four English and two American Chinese-language newspapers each received threatening letters this morning (the 18th) from a group claiming to be the "Chinese Youth Patriotic National Salvation Corps." These "patriotic elements" intend to use bombs and bullets as weapons against the newspapers and said they are willing to perish together with the newspaper staff. The six newspapers are the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, the Shanghai Evening Star, the Wenhui Bao, and the Huamei Bao. The Wenhui Bao has published two editorials and

received two letters.

The Huamei Bao is the same. Miles, the publisher of the Huamei Bao, has received similar threats many times in the past two years and is no longer surprised. After receiving the letters, the newspapers immediately reported to the police departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession, who are currently investigating the matter. In the past year or two, Shanghai has seen more than one act of terrorists opposing newspapers that are not ideologically pro-Japanese, so these letters will be taken seriously. The case of Chen Guodong, the head of the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury newspaper vendors, being

shot and killed

on Dagu Road at 7:30 PM yesterday, does not seem to have any political meaning because Chen has no connection to politics. However, in September 1937, Chen received letters criticizing him for "selling anti-Japanese newspapers," which may have some connection to the activities of these terrorists. The letter received by a certain English newspaper this morning is as follows: To all newspaper publishers: Since the Incident, members of the media have been unable to break free from the shackles of their thinking, leading to deeper and deeper misunderstandings. In fact, the Kuomintang, under the guise of the Three Principles of the People, has seized political power and manipulated the people, disregarding their hardships and sacrificing the interests of the country to the Western powers as a skill to exploit the people's blood and sweat. None of the promises made at the beginning of the revolution have been fulfilled. As a result, communism, socialism, and other ideologies have taken the opportunity to rise. The Soviet Union's incitement of our country's youth is nothing more than to communize East Asia and disrupt its peace. We patriotic elements, in view of this, have risen up to resist Japan and save our compatriots from the depths of misery, so that our country can complete a splendid and brilliant new nation and strive to maintain permanent independence in the world. However, the media, not understanding the truth, is calling a deer a horse and putting Zhang's hat on Li's head. If you continue to spread absurd remarks and anesthetize our compatriots, it will only be like carrying firewood to put out a fire and harming our people. If you do not change your true colors and comments, our vanguard of national salvation will definitely use force to suppress you. Bombs and bullets will come together. We national salvation elements are willing to perish together with the staff of your newspaper. Don't blame us for not warning you in advance. This is to inform you in advance and wait for your awakening. Sincerely, the Chinese Youth Patriotic National Salvation Corps, April 17, 28th year of the Republic of China.

### Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings Through the Ages – Only Today and Tomorrow – Replacing Works – There are Rare Treasures

Since the opening of the Chinese Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Through the Ages on the fourth floor of the Great New World Department Store, it has been an unprecedented success. However, due to the small venue, the audience is extremely crowded and perspiring heavily. Manager Cai of the Great New World, in view of this, has specially increased sponsorship, specially expanding the venue so that the association can increase displays and add seats for the audience to rest. Since yesterday, the association has replaced more than one hundred valuable works, and the number of new and old viewers has doubled. The association has specially increased the number of staff to provide hospitality, which is very busy. Among the works replaced, there are many rare treasures not listed in the catalog, such as Liang Kai's "Sleeping Ape" from the Five Dynasties, with inscriptions by Liao Ying of the Song Dynasty. Ye Gongchuo praised it as Liang Fengzi's best work, making it the most valuable. It is heard that the exhibition period is scheduled to end on the 20th, so there are only today and tomorrow for the exhibition. It is expected that the venue will be unprecedentedly lively, and those who generally love art will definitely not miss this last opportunity.

### The Kwangtung and Flandre Have Been Repaired and Resumed Sailing – The Kwangtung Will Arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd – The Flandre Will Arrive in Shanghai in Early Next Month

The Kwangtung, a mail ship on the British company Eurasia Route, left Shanghai for Europe on the 28th of last month. At about 9:00 AM on the 30th, while traveling in the waters between Shantou and Hong Kong, it collided with the French postal company Flandre, which was coming to Shanghai, due to heavy fog. Both ships were severely damaged. The Kwangtung sailed to Hong Kong for repairs, and the Flandre also returned to Hong Kong to enter the dock. This has been recorded in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the goods and passengers transported to Europe by the Kwangtung have been transferred to the Stretley (transliteration) for transport to Europe. The ship has now been repaired and is scheduled to come to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 20th and arrive at the port on the 23rd. It will replace the Stretley on the 25th to return to Europe from Shanghai. It is heard that the Flandre will also be repaired and will be able to leave the dock to come to Shanghai next month. It is now scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Marseilles on May 8. Due to the ship schedule, the trip to Japan has been cancelled.

The Memorial Service for Wang Yiting Was Held Yesterday

Leaders from All Walks of Life Came to Pay Their Respects

After the death of Mr. Wang Yiting, the former Chairman of the Central Disaster Relief Preparatory Fund Custody Committee, last year, the Huzhou natives in Shanghai and various charitable organizations held memorial services one after another. Yesterday, his family held a memorial service at the Buddhist Jingye Society on Hart Road. Leaders from all walks of life, friends of his lifetime, and all members of the Wang Qinda Permanent Memorial Association, including Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Wu Yunzhai, Xie Jiaqian, Lu Jiesun, Guan Jiongzhi, Gu Junyang, Chen Lengseng, and Zhu Zigan, all went to pay their respects. Plain cars and white horses were prepared to the utmost of mourning.

### Contradictory and Bizarre – A Fake Communist Letter – The Letterhead Was Found to Be Made in Japan – The Content Said That Britain and France Were Aiding Japan

According to the Continental News, yesterday (the 17th), reporters from various newspapers received a letter in the name of a fake Communist party, directly attacking Britain and France. Last night, when the Japanese side received reporters from various newspapers, it discussed the similarity between the letter and the anti-British and anti-French articles in the newspapers in the Japanese-occupied areas. It was claimed that the Japanese authorities were unaware of this matter and even requested to see the letter. A reporter mentioned a similar section and then said that this may be a joke. However, he heard paper experts claim that the paper used for the letter was manufactured in Japan. This letter is three pages long and contains several sentences stating that Britain and France do not want China to unite, that a certain British munitions factory has secretly aided Japan with the government's permission, that France has also signed a secret agreement with Japan to control parts of Yunnan and Guangxi, and that it allows Japan to act freely in Hainan Island. The letter ends with slogans such as "Down with Japanese imperialism!" and "Down with all imperialism!"

### Two Residences of Wang Jingwei – Being Actively Arranged – Reliable Sources Said That Wang Has Not Come to Shanghai

The mystery of Wang Jingwei's arrival in Shanghai has not been confirmed as of yesterday. According to a reliable source, Wang has left Hanoi, but has not come to Shanghai. However, his two residences on Route Frelupt and Anhsi Temple Road in the French Concession are indeed being actively arranged. Various fellow-countrymen associations continued to hold a dinner party at Tianle Guobing in Hankou Road last night, which was convened by the Shaoxing and Zhenjiang fellow-countrymen associations. Representatives of more than 50 people from Ningbo, Sichuan, Jiujiang, Wenzhou, Wujiang, Jiangning, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Rufou, Guangdong, Kunshan, Zhenjiang, Shaoxing, Taixian, Baoshan, Jiading, Yangshu, Chaozhou, Chening Zhenhai and other fellow-countrymen associations attended. During the meeting, they exchanged disaster relief opinions in detail and unanimously decided to promote fundraising for disaster relief. Yang Gexian, a centenarian, delivered a speech, expressing that the consumer cooperatives for the victims planned to sell calligraphy and painting to raise shares, and said that he had not drunk alcohol for more than 30 years, and was willing to drink a glass today to wish everyone a long life and to encourage them to work hard for disaster relief.

Dongtie Exhibition

Since the planning of the Ancient and Modern Dongtie Exhibition to benefit the victims was started by famous Shanghai celebrities Lin Kanghou, Jian Banghou, and Xu Jichu, it has been enthusiastically supported by all walks of life. Recently, Wang Yizhi and Li Zhaoshi, secretaries of the Dutch Embassy, mailed Zhou Bangjun, the initiator of the association, a letter with a joint war for the Dutch princess' wedding anniversary, invitations to meet with diplomatic personnel from various countries, and poetry, which can be described as exquisite. The Mayor's invitation from the British Red Cross, the Mussolini invitation from overseas Chinese in Italy, and various invitations from Chinese business associations in Nanyang, are all available for the United States and all countries. The spring festival couplets are dazzling and cannot be obtained suddenly. If there is such Dongtie, it can be sent to the Preparatory Office as soon as possible.

The Travel Industry's Disaster Relief Donation

The disaster relief donation for the hotel industry in the city in March ended on the 16th of this month, totaling 22,200,200,000.92 yuan, of which the Oriental Hotel donated the most, totaling 1,548.65 yuan, followed by the China Hotel, totaling 1,216.15 yuan, which has been reported to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association.

The Silver and Money Industry

The members of the silver and money industry in the city organized the Silver and Money Industry Consumer Cooperative and recently held a second shareholding campaign. By the 15th, a total of 863 members had been recruited, with a total of 2211 shares, and it had received the support of senior colleagues Xu Jikou and Lin Kanghou. All work is progressing smoothly, and the silver and money industry is still continuing to recruit participants, and it will be established soon.

### Yang Qi, President of the Second Special District Court, Took Office Yesterday – Jin Baojun, Head of the Clerk, Resigned – Zhou Daren Was Appointed by the Ministry of Justice

Yang Qi, the President of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court, went to the court at 9:00 AM yesterday to officially take office, and Yang Peng, the President of the Gao San branch court who was temporarily acting as the President of the Second Special Court, handed over the seal and all documents and records. The former head of the clerk, Wu Shijun, had also sent a telegram to the Ministry of Justice requesting to resign, which was approved. Another telegram appointed Zhou Daren to come to Shanghai to take the position of Head Clerk. Zhou was appointed to come to Shanghai with President Yang Qi and also arrived at the court at 9:00 AM yesterday to take office. After taking office, Yang Qi is still requesting instructions from the Ministry of Justice in Chongqing regarding the date of the swearing-in ceremony, and will schedule it later. After taking office, Yang also met with his subordinates and instructed them to continue to work as usual and not to make any changes for the time being. The new Head Clerk, Zhou Daren, served as the Presiding Judge of the First Special Court in the city in 1920, and after the January 28th Incident, he was transferred to the position of President of the Hebei Xingtai District Court for four years, and then transferred to the position of Judge of the Supreme Court. After the outbreak of the August 13th War of Resistance, the National Government and the Supreme Court moved west to Chongqing, but Zhou did not go. Now he has been appointed by the Ministry to take on a new position.

### The Annual Meeting of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China – Emphasizes the Development of Southwest China (Continued) – Believes That the Chinese People's Persuasion and Working Characteristics – Their Harvest Is Enough to Offset the Greatest Tragedy – The Bank's Profits Have Decreased Due to the Impact of the Sino-Japanese War

National Trade

The circulation of funds should not be biased towards the current war between the two major Eastern countries, but in this situation, it would be inhumane not to express deep sympathy for the plight of the Chinese people, many of whom are friends of the Bank. Although the current situation in China presents countless scenes of tragedy and chaos, a development is underway that fills China and the world with hope. I would like to talk about the efforts to establish a new economic plan in the western provinces of China, and the immigration to this underdeveloped area with abundant natural resources. It is estimated that thousands of Chinese people, including merchants and professionals, have now moved to the western frontier. Initially, the problem of finding suitable work for these people seemed unsolvable, but thanks to the enthusiastic efforts and planning of the responsible authorities, I have no hesitation in believing that the Chinese people's adaptability and hard-working characteristics are sufficient to offset the losses caused by one of the greatest tragedies in history with a surplus. Since the beginning of this century, friends of China have repeatedly expressed their hope to the Chinese authorities to open up the wealthy western provinces, to connect Yunnan and Myanmar with trading waterways and to trade with various countries, but this has never been achieved. Now, under the threat of force, China is automatically seeking a raw material outlet across the Burmese border, and significant progress has been made in the construction of trunk roads. These roads connect the important cities of the Republic of China with Myanmar and the navigable points of the Irrawaddy River.

The Shanghai Situation

The situation in Shanghai has not changed significantly from what I saw a year ago and is no different from what the general public knows. Foreign trade there suffered more in 1938 than in other parts of China. Regarding the stability of Chinese currency, I commented on it a year ago. Due to the establishment of the puppet United Reserve Bank of Peiping and Tianjin and the issuance of new "puppet" currency in North China, the Chinese government's restriction on the sale of British pounds and other foreign currencies has been damaged. Although foreign exchange has a designated amount in a few months, the exchange rate from Shanghai to London has fallen rapidly, from one shilling and two pence twenty-five.

### The Southwest Opium Poppy Disappears; Fields are Planted with Grain; Broadcasting of Narcotics in Occupied Areas is the Opposite; Dr. Dyke, Upon Returning to Shanghai After a Pleasant Journey, Sighs and Speaks; The Entire Chinese People Unite to Support the Government

The Continental Press reports that Dr. Dyke, secretary of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, recently traveled through the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, a journey of two thousand miles, and has now returned to Shanghai. According to what he told reporters, the Japanese authorities in the occupied areas are currently cultivating the evils of narcotics, while the "free" China, directly managed by the National Government, is rapidly freeing its people from drug addiction. Throughout his journey, in what used to be the most famous opium poppy growing areas in China, he hardly saw a single red poppy flower. Only in some mountainous areas of Yunnan Province did he find poppies still being planted, likely because the government authorities there could not reach those areas, or they were not affected by the government's anti-drug education program. This shows that the achievements in the areas occupied by the invaders, such as Nanjing and other occupied cities, are the opposite of the achievements in the areas governed by China itself, like day and night. Five years ago, when Mr. Dyke was returning to New York, he traveled through western China and saw opium poppies everywhere in Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces. The smell of opium was noticeable in the streets, and this kind of narcotic was openly sold and smoked everywhere. Vendors selling narcotics were all prospering. But today, shops selling opium have all closed, and the smell is no longer detectable. The opium poppies in the fields have all been eradicated, replaced by new grains needed for life. Another change in West China that earned Mr. Dyke's praise was the huge construction projects now underway in the interior, which promise to promote agricultural development. Mr. Dyke also said that in Sichuan, he inspected the plans of the Provincial Agricultural Improvement Bureau. This bureau is managed by three agricultural experts who studied in the United States, and their work includes distributing improved seeds to farmers, teaching them new cultivation methods, eliminating plant diseases and pests, and developing new serums to treat livestock diseases. Currently, the bureau has two large stations near Chengdu, and they are making extensive use of the discoveries made in the laboratories of Jinling University and West China Union University. They also recruit hundreds of young farmers to the two stations for three months of training on a regular basis. The development of agriculture in Sichuan Province owes much to the efforts of these people. Before Dr. Dyke arrived in Chongqing, he entered Yunnan Province from Burma via the newly built Yunnan-Burma Highway. It is said that this highway is a great achievement that overcame enormous difficulties, which is almost unbelievable. The workers used almost entirely indigenous tools and worked for twelve months to complete it. The quality of the project is quite good. There are still thousands of workers working on various parts of the highway, especially many workers working in the narrow mountain passes to improve it. At the same time, thousands of others are straightening out the curves and building bridges to make the highway more suitable. According to Dr. Dyke, the highway will be severely tested when the rainy season arrives in western Yunnan, and it seems that it should not be relied upon too much as a reliable route. However, given the insurmountable difficulties that have been overcome, and the tremendous achievements that have been made, it is not appropriate to rush to judgement before the event. While in Chongqing, Dr. Dyke and his traveling companion, Dr. Claypool, were invited to a tea party hosted by Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang. The Chairman and his wife expressed their gratitude for the assistance given by foreign friends and expressed their conviction that China would achieve final victory. Although Chairman Chiang, the leader of China, has to attend many meetings, he is still energetic and not at all tired. Dr. Dyke also praised the unity of the entire Chinese people, saying that the Chinese people have an optimistic and courageous spirit and fully support the National Government. The unity of the country shows no sign of cracking. It is reported that Dr. Dyke came to Shanghai briefly last November and then went to Madras, India to attend the International Missionary Conference. After the conferences were over, he traveled extensively in the Chinese interior for nearly half a year. He is scheduled to return to the United States next week on the Yu Shou. As for the eight foreign exchanges, from June of last year to the present, the exchange rate has remained the same. The market situation has only seen mild contractions and expansions. Maintaining the stability of Chinese currency and trade with the United Kingdom is extremely important. On March 8th, the Secretary of Finance announced the establishment of a currency stabilization fund of ten million pounds sterling. Because this bank was granted a guarantee by the British Treasury to compensate for losses, it participated in this effort. Its establishment is undoubtedly intended for this purpose, and it is welcomed. Other than indirectly, this amount is unrelated to North China. This issue will cause the British, American, and French governments to lodge serious protests with Japan. As mentioned previously, because the Shanghai foreign exchange rate has been able to maintain a relatively stable basis since June of last year, foreign assistance has only been normal and intermittent in nature. Although the situation still has some unstable signs, we have good reason to hope that this stabilization fund will be effective. I have already given you a brief report on the impact of the damage to the trade in the major areas where this bank has branches.

The Main Reason

I would like to offer a simple suggestion on a matter that I believe will have a significant impact on international trade in the future. This is the Anglo-American Trade Agreement. I would like to call this agreement the British Empire-American Trade Agreement, because its text stipulates that it is not only about trade between the United States and Great Britain. This is an effort by two major countries to improve the management of goods trade, simplify it to encourage trade development, and seek the actual benefits of all parties involved. Our government has given the Export Credits Guarantee Department more power so that it can provide extensive assistance to our country's export trade. I very much welcome this decision by the government. If the global situation can become stable, the improvement of world trade and the increase in raw material prices will also improve the living standards of the eastern countries that we are very concerned about, which will not be difficult to achieve, etc. The Chairman's report and the 1938 accounts were unanimously approved by the attendees. The directors and auditors whose terms had expired were quickly re-appointed, and a vote of thanks was passed to the Chairman, directors, managers, and staff for their good work. A special meeting was then held to present the plan to transform the bank's charter to the attendees, which was also unanimously passed, and the meeting adjourned.

The Commercial Press

Salary Restoration Measures

Original salaries restored for those below 30 yuan, universal 10% increase for those above 30 yuan

Since the salary restoration movement at The Commercial Press last year, initial negotiations have repeatedly yielded little progress. In order to achieve their demands, the Mutual Aid Society of the Press sent three representatives to Hong Kong at the end of January this year to meet with the general manager of the Press and explain the difficult situation of the staff, requesting salary restoration. After several discussions, they finally obtained the general manager's understanding, who agreed to find ways to restore discounts during the spring sales in order to alleviate the staff's difficulties. The representatives were convinced of the general manager's sincere attitude and returned to Shanghai to await the actual results. It was recently heard that the company officially announced the salary restoration measures on the 17th, stipulating that from April, monthly salaries below 30 yuan would be restored to their original levels, and those above 30 yuan would receive a universal increase of 10%. Thus, the salary restoration movement that had lasted for several months came to an end. The Society believes that its decision to demand salary restoration was deeply supported by all sectors of society and has sent letters of gratitude to the Public Works Department, the International Labour Organization's China Branch, and various agencies.

Ministry of Economic Affairs, Lu Declares

Silk Fabrics Not Banned for Transport

Lace Also Exempt from Transport Ban

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously sent a telegram to the Ministry of Economic Affairs requesting permission for silk satin being blocked from transport to Shanghai. The Ministry responded with a telegram stating, "Upon investigation, silk fabrics have not been designated as prohibited goods and are therefore not subject to the transport ban. As for the two items prohibited for transport, hemp, cotton, and their products, lace and other hemp and cotton fabrics are also not included and should be exempt from the transport ban." In addition to sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance ordering the customs to comply, a telegram is hereby sent for your information. Ministry of Economic Affairs, seal.

### The Great Achievements of Father Jacquinot (III) by Zhao Erqian

Father Jacquinot's life is simple. Besides prayer and work, he seems to do nothing else. He wears the black robe worn by priests, and on his head, he wears the small hat that Frenchmen like to wear, the Buney, with a small anchor fixed to the front. On the left lapel hangs the emblem of the International Red Cross, and in his hand, he carries a gold-edged leather-bound breviary. Apart from that, he has nothing else. Since the Paris government awarded him the Legion of Honor, he has fastened a red, white, and blue silk ribbon on his button, indicating that he has received the honor of Chevalier. He has large eyes, a pair of large ears, and a thick mustache hanging on his mouth, showing a smiling and benevolent appearance. His nose is prominent and hooked downwards, which the Chinese call a dragon falcon, and foreigners say he looks like a Jew. His body is tall and majestic, much like an Anglo-American rather than a Latin. In terms of temperament, he is a kind-hearted, approachable, planning, courageous, and very determined person. He has very little free time, cherishing every moment. In addition to refugee affairs, he also gives speeches, attends meetings, and preaches. When he presides over and announces a meeting or discusses refugee issues, he presses his left arm tightly on the table and speaks eloquently, expressing his own views in an orderly and well-organized manner. His attitude seems a bit autocratic, but in fact, what he proposes is exactly the solution that everyone wants to say but has not yet formed, so everyone wholeheartedly agrees and asks him to implement it. Every Sunday, he often preaches in the Catholic Church, urging the audience to extend their love for God to love for others, sacrificing the small self to achieve the greater self. His words are sincere and his language is moving, often ending with charitable work and refugee issues. Afterwards, he is in the reception room, receiving guests with a smile, kindly and benevolently. Regardless of Chinese or foreign, noble or lowly, old or young, male or female, everyone can get a few words from him that make people feel a kind of comfort in their hearts. He is so relaxed, chatting and laughing, without any signs of fatigue, dealing with people in a way that transcends worldly concerns, forgetting his own week's fatigue and exhaustion, making you resolve to see him again. This priest is not only a magnet for attracting friends but also understands the psychology and needs of each individual. I once saw him tightly hold the hands of a newly married couple and say, "Are you good to her? Are you good to him? I hope you come often." His words were kind, like a loving mother caring about the happiness of her children. Another person who fled to the concession wanted to know the situation of his property in Hongkou. He asked Father Jacquinot to find out. The next day, Father Jacquinot returned and took out a piece of broken tile from his pocket, proving that everything this gentleman owned had become ashes and rubble. In short, Father Jacquinot is a comfort to the distressed, a savior to the poor, and with him, the difficult problems of human form and spirit are largely solved.

After Mr. Jacquinot disappeared and arrived in Shanghai, he made a statement saying that he had traveled in China for a long time and regarded China as his second hometown. His enthusiasm for loving China is no less than that of the Chinese people. The donations he raised in the United States have reached US$700,000, and all expenses are covered by the fundraisers, so not a penny will be used from the donations. This spirit of "all drops return to the public" is truly thought-provoking and worthy of emulation. He is not only "a friend of China" and "the father of refugees" but also a patriotic "Chinese!"

### Shameless Youths Steal the Name of Patriotic Organizations; Hold Weapons to Intimidate, Extort, and Plunder; Search Businesses and Confiscate "Enemy Loans"; Repeated Offenses, Two Courts Investigate Separately

The youths Huang Xin, Liu Fuqiu, Huang Chuanwen, Hua Minxiang, Zhang Ronggao, Zhang Caiyi, Jiang Bofang, Fei Guishun, Jin Huiquan, etc., have all received considerable education, and most of them are former classmates of the Beigong School in Zhabei. However, Huang and others associated with the wrong people and specialized in low-level behavior, resulting in all of them being subject to legal sanctions for committing fraud and obtaining property. After their release from prison, the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, and Huang and others saw an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. They borrowed names such as the "Iron-Blooded Youth Eradication Corps" and the "National Salvation Youth Service Society," made badges, seals, and receipts, and went to various woolen and dye businesses within the jurisdiction of the Old Zhabei General Police Station, claiming to be

Investigating Enemy Loans

They conducted arbitrary inspections. If they believed that the goods of the business were slightly suspicious, they would take them away. Although they issued receipts after taking the goods, the general businesses, because the goods taken away were either of unclear origin or were indeed enemy goods, all endured in silence. Huang and others sold or pawned the goods they obtained, or distributed them to make new clothes. The money they obtained was used for pleasure. Huang and others knew that the businesses had hidden illnesses and

Dared Not Speak Out

Therefore, they were bold and reckless, and the number of crimes they committed was innumerable. Recently, Chief Detective Yun Agen and Detective Chen Yonggui of the Old Zhabei Police Station obtained clues and supervised detectives Wang Shusen, Gao Yong'an, Shan Zhaoxian, etc., in rooms 25 and 1204 of the Great Shanghai Hotel, arresting Huang and others and a woman, Lu Qunying (also known as Wang Xiaomei). They confiscated a pistol, four bullets, seven "Iron-Blooded Eradication Youth Corps" badges, one "National Salvation Youth Service Society" seal, and

Nine Receipt Books

It was found that Huang and others had used weapons to rob property in the following places: (1) Gongtai Woolen Shop at 263 Fuzhou Road, robbed of fabrics worth 531 yuan; (2) Chen Xinda Dye Shop at 20, Lane 237, Guangdong Road, robbed of 250 yuan in cash; (3) Qingshun Cotton Cloth Shop at 4, Lane 207, Ningbo Road, robbed of 500 yuan worth of cotton cloth; (4) Renchang Woolen Shop at 268 Tianjin Road, robbed of 100 yuan worth of fabric; (5) Huacheng Cotton Cloth Shop at 21, Lane 796, Beijing Road, robbed of 700 yuan worth of fabric; (6) Rongtai Woolen Shop at 10, Lane 457, Ningbo Road, robbed of 1,300 yuan worth of woolen fabric; (7) Cai Hongji Hardware Shop at 6, Lane 542, Ningbo Road, robbed of 1,000 yuan worth of

Loans and Other Cases

Part of the goods were recovered, as well as gold and diamond rings that Huang and others had pawned. It was also found that Liang Cuoli, the owner of Guangxinfeng Shop on Guangdong Road, and Chen Quanlin, who lived at 11, Lane 32, Qipu Road, had received stolen goods from Huang and others at low prices. Therefore, they were all prosecuted in the First Special Court. Yesterday afternoon, judge Feng Jude of the First Criminal Court heard the case. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Yue Junwei to defend them. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted Huang and others for robbery and Jin Huiquan, Chen Quanlin, and Liang Cuoli for

Receiving Stolen Goods

At the same time, it was stated that the defendants took advantage of the unspeakable pain of various businesses and seized the opportunity to rob them. They also carried weapons and borrowed the name of patriotic organizations to achieve their purpose of robbing property, which was particularly abhorrent and should be severely punished according to law. Then, the case was presented, which lasted for more than an hour. After the court questioned each defendant, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned to a later date. The defendants were returned to custody. It is heard that Huang and others also committed seven similar cases in the French Concession. Therefore, after the First Special Court finishes the hearing, the Second Special Court has also requested that the defendants be transferred for investigation and interrogation.

### Case of Japanese Police Insulting British Woman; Strong Protest Will Be Lodged; Demand for 95,000 Yuan in Compensation; Lawyer of the Senior Evening News Appointed to Handle

The English-language North China Daily News reports that Mrs. Davis, a British woman, was insulted by a Japanese Consulate police officer on the Garden Bridge yesterday (the 17th). Mr. Davis has now hired a lawyer from the Senior Evening News. It is heard that he will demand 95,000 yuan in compensation for medical expenses and the mental suffering of Mrs. Davis. It is also heard that the British Consul-General is currently meeting with a lawyer from the Senior Evening News to hear the details and may lodge a strong protest because of this matter. Mrs. Davis may be admitted to a mental hospital to treat the trauma to her nervous system. Mr. Davis is currently discussing the matter further with his lawyer. According to Mrs. Davis, she was stopped by a Japanese Consulate police officer when she passed the Garden Bridge yesterday. The police officer said that she did not bow to the sentry. Mrs. Davis replied that although she was Japanese, she had married a British man, so she was also British. The Japanese police officer was very angry and dragged Mrs. Davis into a small room behind the sentry box on the bridge and mocked her, saying, "You think you are superior to the Japanese. Marrying a British man does not make you omnipotent." Mr. Davis said that his wife had always sympathized with the Japanese, but now she has suffered this blow, and her sympathy has been greatly diminished.

### Sleeping at Anhe Temple Last Night, Detectives Caught Bandits in a Fierce Gunfight, Both Sides Fired Thirty or Forty Shots, Three Bandits Were Captured and Suspects Were Arrested. The Homeowner Was Strict and There Were No Losses

At approximately 10:30 last night, four bandits wearing short clothes and carrying guns suddenly went to the residence of the Yan family at 8 Anhe Temple Road in the Western District to rob them. The owner, Yan Xingfang, and others were not yet asleep. When they saw that the intruders were not friendly, they immediately secretly pressed the doorbell button and reported to the police departments of the Public and French Concessions. As a result, detectives quickly gathered. The bandits in the house suddenly heard a lot of voices outside and knew that things were not going well. They had no time to rob and turned around to flee, but because detectives from both concessions had surrounded the area, they opened fire first, and the detectives returned fire. The two sides fought fiercely for a long time, firing a total of thirty to forty shots. Three bandits were shot down and captured, and taken back to the police station. The detectives searched around after the incident and arrested sixteen suspects in the vicinity, who were also taken to the police station for interrogation. The homeowner suffered no losses.

Charity Lottery Tickets Increasingly Trusted

Salesmen Set Up Throughout Shanghai; Ticket Purchases at Branch Offices are Enthusiastic

The ninth period of the French Charity Lottery to benefit refugees will be drawn on May 3. As the date of the draw approaches, the number of buyers is increasing. It is also learned that since the general sales office, the Dagong Enterprise Company branch office, sold the second prize ticket number 28931 in the seventh period and the first prize ticket number 31607 in the eighth period, the number of people buying tickets from the company's branch office has become even more enthusiastic. Therefore, to facilitate ticket purchases by ladies, the branch office will extend its business hours from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM starting today. Also, because the lottery tickets are increasingly trusted, the number of sales businesses has increased to 250, which have been set up throughout the two concessions of Shanghai.

### Five Notorious Robbers Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Another Offender Sentenced to Eight Years in Prison

Last month, on the 19th, Xie Zhiguang, a Chinese detective of the Dixiwei Road Police Station, and Zhao Lianbi, a detective, arrested six notorious robbers, Xu Yongquan, Wang Yushan, Zhu Yunlong, Shen Yougen, Chen Haibin, and Jiang Xianghong, in various places such as Haig Road and Yuyuan Road. Four pistols and thirty-two bullets were seized. It was found that they had colluded with Li Arei, who was still at large, to rob the homes of Yao Jiafei and Pan Ximan, Chinese detectives at 339 Daxilu Road, and Liang Weiming at 7, Lane 156, Yidingpan Road, taking property and two pistols. On the 11th of last month, they broke into the home of Wang Zhiyue at 39, Lane 189, Kainer Road, and kidnapped Zhang Zhisan and took him away, obtaining 7,000 yuan in ransom. The case was sent to the First Special Court. After the interrogation was completed, judge Xiao Peishen of the Second Criminal Court announced the verdict yesterday morning. Xu Yongquan, Wang Yushan, Zhu Yunlong, Yao Yougen, and Chen Haibin were sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping for ransom and robbery, and were deprived of their civil rights for life. Jiang Xianghong was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. The pistols and bullets were confiscated.

### After the Fake "Section Chief" Wang Xianming Was Killed; The Corpse's Wife Signed and Received the Body for Burial; One Knife Wound to the Chest Was the Fatal Wound

Wang Xianming, a fake "Chief of the First Section of the Shanghai Municipal Government" from Anhui (a pseudonym of Wang Huanzhang), was 52 years old this year. He lived with his wife, Mrs. Yao (43 years old from Shaoxing), at 71, Lane 190, Mett Herst Road in the western district of Shanghai. Every morning, he went to the fake "Municipal Government" in the city center to work and returned home when he finished his errands in the evening. He usually kept a low profile and had very little contact with the outside world. At 7:30 PM on the 17th, he was suddenly lured by patriotic volunteers to outside the back door of 8890 Huagenei Road, French Concession, next to a garbage can in Hongyun Lane. He was stabbed violently in the heart with a sharp knife and died on the spot. Residents in the lane discovered the body and called the police. After inspecting the scene, they reported to the French Police Station, which sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. A murder weapon (a seven-inch long sharp knife) and notes were found next to the body and taken back to the police station. The corpse was taken to the morgue for examination. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the French police station found the corpse's family that night and notified the corpse's wife, Wang Yao, to come to the station. Yesterday, the case was reported to prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, who, accompanied by a forensic doctor, went to the morgue of the Public Works Department Hospital on Tallas Road at 11:00 AM to examine the corpse. After the examination, they sat in the courtroom. The detective reported the investigation after the incident. The corpse's wife, Wang Yao, applied to receive the corpse for burial. The official ruled that Wang Huancao, that is, Wang Xianming, was indeed stabbed to death. The corpse was handed over to Wang Yao for burial. The sharp knife was still handed over to the original detective to be taken back to the police station for investigation.

(Another report) Yesterday's newspaper reported that the fake "clerk of the First Section of the Municipal Government," Wang Xianming, was killed. According to news from the fake staff, the deceased's real name was Wang Huanzhang, 51 years old, from Anhui. He was the accounting director of the First Section of the fake Municipal Government, with a monthly salary of 140 yuan. Wang was originally an employee of the former Unified Taxation Bureau. Since becoming the fake "director," he had made many enemies because he was manipulating the economy. Therefore, the fake staff speculate that the murder was due to a private feud. The "Chinese Eradication Corps" note found next to the body was intended to shift the target.

### Japanese Side Raises Old Issue; Demands Prevention of Terrorist Activities; Originates from the Killing of Xi Shitai

The North China Daily News reports that the Japanese Consulate General issued a press release at 5:30 PM yesterday (the 17th), stating that the Japanese Consulate authorities yesterday submitted a proposal to the Public Concession Public Works Department regarding the assassination of Dr. Xi Shitai, the "Secretary of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Police Bureau," requesting the implementation of more stringent measures to prevent terrorist crimes in the Public Concession. The press release stated as follows: Japanese Consul General Miura, due to the assassination of Dr. Xi Shitai on April 11, visited Public Works Department Director-General Fanning at 3:45 PM, accompanied by Terazaki, and submitted a proposal regarding the aforementioned unfortunate incident. Furthermore, Miura requested that the understanding reached between the Japanese authorities and the Public Works Department regarding preventing the activities of terrorists in the Public Concession be strictly implemented in the future.

Ewo Cotton Mill

Expands Dyeing and Bleaching Department

Ewo Cotton Mill, managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., has a long history and is the pioneer of foreign-owned cotton mills in China. Due to its perfect management and the right people in charge, it has had profits every year. In 1938, it even exceeded all previous records, with a net profit of over 6 million yuan. It is heard that the original stock price of five taels has risen to a peak of over 20 yuan. As the mill's business is developing rapidly, it is expanding its original dyeing and bleaching department, adding factory buildings and purchasing a large number of machines. It has also hired Mr. Zhou Jiajun as the engineer of the department and Mr. Dong Jiufeng to be in charge of business affairs. Mr. Zhou was previously an engineer at the Qingfeng Factory and has rich knowledge and experience. He is a well-known talent in the dyeing and bleaching industry. Mr. Dong also has a long-standing reputation in the cotton cloth industry and has close relationships with various customers. With the right assistants, the excellent results of the factory can be assured. The new product, "Yizhichun" bleached cloth, has already started selling, and the remaining products will be launched one after another.



### America and the Pacific

— Mao Lie

If Chamberlain's appeasement policy toward Germany and Italy can be considered a lion's roar, then Roosevelt's demand to Hitler and Mussolini for guarantees not to invade other countries' territories for ten years can be considered a bolt from the blue. Under this thunderous sound, of course, some people are flustered, deliberately pretending to be nonchalant, unwilling to show weakness after all.

What kind of repercussions this giant sound will have in Europe, we will soon hear, so let's put it aside for now. However, what follows this giant sound is a fleet like a cloud formation, entering the Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic. What impact this has on the Far Eastern countries on the Pacific side, I think, is what we should pay the most attention to at present.

According to the newspapers of the past two days, Pittman, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, has repeatedly advocated sanctions against Japan. This time, the movement of the fleet is quite sufficient as a backing for this proposal. Senator William King's remarks are even more blatant, believing that the U.S. Navy's movement aims to prevent Japan from coveting the Philippines or the Dutch East Indies. Other "authoritative sources" believe that Japan's second attack target is Hong Kong, and the U.S. fleet's return to the Pacific can make Japan slightly restrain its ambitions. Therefore, the Tokyo Reuters dispatch stated that "the naval circles here are greatly surprised," which shows that it is not a casual performance.

According to my guess, the alliance of democratic countries has been completed, and what they are dealing with is not only Germany and Italy in Europe, but Japan in the Far East must also be included. As for the method of dealing with them, it seems that they have been assigned their respective responsibilities: in Europe, if Germany and Italy launch an attack, then Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries will surround and strike hard, while the United States will provide support in terms of arms and economy; in the Far East, if Japan takes another step forward, then the United States will impose sanctions nearby, while the colonies of Britain and France will provide convenience in various aspects. In other words, on the east coast of the Atlantic, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are the main players, and the United States is the secondary player; on the west coast of the Pacific, the United States is the main player, and Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are the secondary players, thus solving the various fascist countries separately.

If a world war ultimately and unfortunately breaks out, my guess will probably not be too far from the truth. Because European countries cannot reach the Far East, they have no choice but to entrust the affairs of the western Pacific to the United States, which has a superior position and all kinds of power, which is inevitable in the situation.

Of course, the Soviet Union will not stand idly by in the Far East. However, its special responsibility seems to be on the continent, unlike the United States, which is specifically responsible for the Pacific, so we still have to look forward to the United States' performance in the Pacific.

### Reunion

— Bei Qiong

The sky, like a widow, wore a sullen face, strangely stuffy.

——"Report! The enemy army is passing through Zhujiazhuang to the west and seems to be advancing here."

A young peddler said breathlessly.

——"How many people?"

——"More than two hundred!"

——"Humph!"

The peddler left, leaving behind a temporary silence; afterwards, Battalion Commander Feng ordered: Gather the troops and resist!

Zhang Xiaosan and Zhao Ming were machine gunners.

Zhang Xiaosan looked at the black muzzle of the gun, which seemed to have a different kind of mystery:

"Mom, help me today, old brother!"

Zhao Ming looked at Zhang Xiaosan and smiled. Xiaosan felt embarrassed and said casually:

"Isn't that right? It all depends on it to drive the devils back to their hometown!"

"Don't make a sound, Xiaosan!"

"Da da da—"

The enemy was again firing bullets, and a wisp of light smoke floated in the air.

A cluster of enemies rushed towards here.

The command from above came: "Open fire!"

Zhang Xiaosan's machine gun muzzle spat out flames.

"Mom, these dead ghosts!"

Several enemies fell, but still rushed towards here, vaguely emitting a cry.

"—Brothers, —we are one family…"

"We don't fight our own people—ah!"

"—Brothers, stop firing!"

"—We are here to surrender—…"

Zhang Xiaosan heard it, Zhao Ming heard it, and the ordinary brothers all heard it, thinking in their hearts: "How strange!"

"Da da da…"

The enemies fell continuously, and behind the enemies, dense sparks also flashed.

The command from above came: "Stop firing!"

The enemies got closer and closer, and this side shouted

"Lay down your guns or we'll open fire!"

One gun after another fell to the ground, with sparks following behind the enemies.

"Compatriots! Welcome!"

"Brothers, we have returned to the embrace of our mother."

The enemy—no, now they are brothers on the same battle line! That captain shook our Battalion Commander Feng's hand, and the hot blood of patriotism flowed in the palm of their hands…

Zhang Xiaosan opened his mouth in surprise, looking at the dark-faced captain, his heart like a cauldron of oil, frying an exciting and fantastic idea.

"Big brother!" Zhang Xiaosan suddenly shouted.

The dark-faced captain turned his head, his eyes fixed on Zhang Xiaosan, his wide lips trembling:

"Xiaosan, you're here!"

They embraced, tears of excitement flowing, blood cells of loyalty flowing in their blood vessels.

Zhang Xiaosan counted in his heart: seven years, seven years of separation, and today we meet on the battlefield!

The enemy army was firing cannons to vent their anger, and finally, they were immersed in a bloody battle again…

### Mr. Lu

— Xiao Xu

Mr. Lu is over there again expressing his profound opinions! His head, shaking back and forth, the blue veins on his forehead protruding:

"Alas! The Chinese people of today are really terrible: um: so I say: everyone over the age of ten should die: yes: should all die:" He deliberately repeated the last sentence. His head shook triumphantly a couple more times.

"Then what about you? Should you die too? That would be a pity!" Someone was teasing him in jest.

"Um: that: that: that: of course: let my children live: and wait for them to transform China:" His face flushed even redder.

"Ha: but your two daughters: when they ask people for candy, their ability is no less than those bureaucrats who were good at fleecing the people in the past!"

"Um: that: that:"

"Hahaha:" Causing a burst of laughter.

Mr. Lu is only in his thirties, but he always likes to express this kind of pedantic nonsense. Sometimes, if his colleagues ask him:

"Then what about our old principal? Should he die too?"

He would say contemptuously: "Oh! Of course! To be honest: these fifty or sixty-year-old geezers are no good: Look at those traitors in the two puppet governments, aren't they all fifty or sixty years old?"

"But: Mr. Lu: how old is your respected father?"

"Ah:… that… that" Then there was another burst of laughter.

Mr. Lu's respected father is already over sixty, but he still left home with great difficulty, following the government to the west to serve the country; but Mr. Lu himself said as soon as the government moved to Hankou:

"Um… I should resign!… My family is still in Shanghai…" So he ran back! Leaving his old father alone there.

When people said that he should go to the inland to serve the country and take care of his old father, his face would flush red again and he would stammer:

"Um: that: that: there is also a lot of work in Shanghai: Moreover: I still have a family…

### Don't Follow Him!

### The Meaning of Life

— Qiang Tou Cao

In the process of time, due to the ever-changing external things, constantly stimulating and reacting, life naturally changes its content; in essence, local changes in quantity increase or decrease, and at a certain stage, it forms the death and rebirth of the entire quality.

The true meaning of life lies in creation. But creation is just a necessary means to complete the enjoyment of "created value." Therefore, to keep enjoying, you must first keep creating. This way, life will not be wasted meaninglessly.

Those who are stingy with life are cowards. Those who waste life are madmen. Those who do not know what life is are idiots. Those who recognize life as an illusion are ghosts.

If you are a warrior at the forefront of an era, then you should cherish life, hold it tightly, and not let go for a moment; indulge in faith, and ideals. Sometimes you should also stake your life on it, and die for it!

### After-Dinner Chat

— Editor

This week is National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. Although we are not publishing a special issue, we welcome such articles and will try our best to publish them. However, the best submissions are no more than 800 words.

### Elegance and Vulgarity

— Mo Xie

In the past, the elegant scholar Ni Yunlin was captured by Zhang Shixin in Taihu Lake one day and beaten to near death because he refused to paint for Zhang Shixin. However, he did not say a word while being beaten. Someone asked him the reason, and he said: Once I open my mouth, it becomes vulgar.

Unbelievable, such an elegant scholar, not even caring for his life, is truly rare. However, isn't there a hint of excessive elegance in such affectation? Because in my opinion, not opening your mouth can only be considered tough and unyielding, which is a good man, unrelated to elegance. If the intention is to take this as elegance, then it is too elegant and becomes vulgar.

Too elegant becomes vulgar, just like what the Scholars said, "Too elegant becomes too vulgar." Often, general calligraphers and painters, at the drop of a hat, drink wine and admire flowers, chant poems and write prose, claiming to be elegant, which made Wu Jingzi greatly ridicule them, and it is still a topic of conversation to this day.

Speaking of this kind of elegance, it seems that the remaining charm still exists today, or it has even intensified, with everything being elegant and nothing being vulgar. Needless to say, even the elegant seals, aliases, and pen names of a few people have exhausted the spectacle of elegance, making people sigh at the ultimate in elegance. At one time, names were always represented by flowers, birds, insects, and fish, and accompanied by mournful and sorrowful adjectives. This can be said to be a soft-style elegance. Now, it has finally changed, and all use □□□□, □口口口 and other words to name themselves. This may be said to be a hard-style.

I am not saying that these names are not elegant at all. On the contrary, I admit their elegance. However, once one person initiates it, many people follow suit, and any elegant thing becomes unbearably vulgar, just like Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty was an elegant person with many elegant deeds, while people like Tang Bohu and Zhang Mengjin of the Ming Dynasty, imitating Handan, acting affectedly, made people want to vomit.

It is certainly not easy to define elegance and vulgarity. However, I say, there seems to be some scope here, in addition to the initiator being elegant and the follower being vulgar, there is also: the intentional is vulgar, and the unintentional is elegant. The vulgarity of Ni Yunlin, I say, is because of his intention. He was originally a person from the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties, which coincided with what the Carnal Prayer Mat said, that every Yuan person had an alias, so he was named Yunlinzi, which is one of the symbols of his vulgarity. As for his deliberately liking cleanliness, he was merely learning from Mi Yuanzhang, and only made his vulgarity reek to the nose. What Party Discipline did by writing poems in Beijing and Hanoi can be seen in the same light: pretending to be elegant, vulgar, vulgar, vulgar!

Mo Junli's "Posing" — imitating Gao Junerji's elegance — is a portrait of these elegant people. I want to collect this material, but I am afraid that there are countless examples from ancient times to the present, which can be loaded with carts and measured with dou and peck, and fill the building with sweat-inducing bamboo slips — using two "zhi" characters, the literary air becomes elegant.

However, elegant affairs are only for scholars, and illiterate dullards have no share; therefore, since there is the too elegant of scholars turning into vulgarity, there is also the too vulgar of dullards turning into elegance. Party Taiwei's gold-selling account, with lamb wine, is this clear proof, and Liangshan Black Whirlwind's opening mouth "old man" and closing mouth "iron ox" are really charming and lovely, and definitely not vulgar. Even A Q under Lu Xun's pen, a few sounds of "I want…" I also consider him the number one elegant person of modern times. Why? It's just because of their pure innocence, unintentional in elegance, and what they say and do, without seeing the ancients before or the comers after, but naturally wonderfully unique throughout the ages, so vulgar that it is too elegant.

Among the scholars, Huang Shanguo had some reason: when he arrived in Xuanzhou, someone asked him to write calligraphy, and he never refused anyone who asked; someone felt sorry for him because he gave it to vulgar people, and he laughed and said, "Bring me a non-vulgar person to see." This statement is truly extremely happy! Conversely, who is an elegant person? Who is not a vulgar person? Compared to this, we can also see some of the truth about elegance and vulgarity.

I often hear people say that "an article should be done in a way that both the elegant and the vulgar can appreciate it" in order to be a wonderful article. I don't quite believe this, because the elegant can appreciate it, but the vulgar may not be able to appreciate it, and what the vulgar can appreciate, the elegant may not necessarily be able to appreciate. Therefore, I think, maybe "elegance and vulgarity cannot appreciate together" is a wonderful article. As for my non-wonderful article, which is difficult to be elegant and difficult to be harmonious with vulgarity, I can only say "elegance and vulgarity cannot appreciate together."

Spring and Autumn

### "The World of Tomorrow"

The 1939 New York World's Fair will open on April 30 and close on October 30. During this six-month period, the anticipated number of visitors will be no less than 50 million, and the number of tourists coming from overseas alone will be more than 3 million. The venue is located in the newly reclaimed lake and swamp area along Flushing Bay on Long Island, about three and a half miles long and more than 1,200 acres wide. The construction project took two years and cost 165 million yuan. A total of 1,500 units participated in the exhibition, including

sixty-two countries, a grand occasion shown in previous exhibitions. According to the authorities in the meeting, this meeting has a very valuable contribution to the promotion of international goodwill. One significant difference between this exhibition and previous exhibitions is that the previous exhibitions mostly focused on the display of past products, while this meeting attempts to predict the future. Therefore, its official name is

The World of Tomorrow. The various buildings of the branch, and what is displayed in them, all strive to meet this point. The various buildings in the meeting are its most obvious feature. Most of the designs adopt the "functional style", and the use of each building is expressed in bold lines. In terms of color, the three bright and eye-catching colors of blue, red, and yellow are used. The exterior of larger buildings is mostly built with colored walls. There is a central point in the meeting where you can overlook the entire venue. There are two types of

unique buildings: one is a luminous sphere with a diameter of 200 feet, supported by water columns shot from the pool below; the other is a spire up to 700 feet high. All 17 miles of streets, 34 miles of pedestrian walkways, and eight major areas in the venue are centered on this point and spread out in all directions. Each major area has a different color tone, and the color becomes thicker the farther it is from the center of the venue, so visitors can determine their location based on the color of the surrounding buildings. Visitors can also take a moving ladder into the interior of the luminous sphere and climb the two slowly rotating platforms inside,

the city of tomorrow arranged there. You can have a rough idea of ​​the future industrial city situation and see its dawn, dusk and different scenes at night. Beautiful pictures are engraved on the top, showing the progress of mankind and civilization, and you can listen to the singing of more than a thousand people. The largest building in the meeting should be the

Road Building, where the "Scottish Coronation" locomotive that once ran in the United States will be lined up. Poland, the Soviet Union, France, Switzerland, and Italy have also brought the latest model trains for exhibition at the meeting. There is a

circular theater in the building that can accommodate 4,000 people and will perform the transportation history of the United States from the carriage era of the past to the streamline locomotive of today. The automobile manufacturing companies have spared no expense to collect the most amazing exhibits. It is said that a certain company has spent 10 million yuan on construction alone, and the area occupied is only 300,000 square feet. However, there is no doubt that this house is one of the giants in the venue. It was designed by the famous theater architect Zidis and built a very vivid prototype, named "The Great Road and Horizon of Tomorrow", which is one-third of a mile long. Visitors can sit on moving chairs and see the future of the highway system. Another

A large automobile company built an elevated highway more than half a mile long, surrounding the building. Visitors will be on this road and have a panoramic view of the entire venue. There are four major buildings in the center of the transportation area: automobiles, railways, aviation, and navy. On both sides of the entrance to the Navy Great Summer, there are realistic ship bows built. The names of the other districts are "Government", "Production", "Distribution", "Transportation", "Commercial System", "Food", "Clothing Decoration" and "Public Interests", all of which are distributed on all sides from the center of the venue. In addition, there is the main avenue in the venue, named "Constitutional Avenue", which starts from the center of the venue and goes straight to the International Lake in front of the Federal Building, which is half a mile long. Next Sunday, President Roosevelt will deliver his opening speech on the stone steps of the building. On both wings of the Federal Building are

two international halls, including many small houses, which are the exhibition halls of the sixty-two countries. Only six countries have built their own pavilions. Among them, the British one is the most magnificent, with a magnificent bronze gate leading to the two halls of "Glory" and "Achievements". In addition, there are metal halls, displaying exhibits related to engineering, civil halls, and a theater. Canada also has its own building, displaying its mineral, agricultural, and forestry products. The Irish architecture mainly uses glass and metal as materials. Australia, New Silun, and South Rhodesia Island also occupy a place in the International Hall. The total investment of foreign governments is about

25 million yuan. There are restaurants from twenty-four countries in the foreign area, which can accommodate 43,000 diners. The most valuable building in the meeting, in terms of its content, should be the 500 famous paintings exhibited in the art gallery, with a total value of 30 million yuan; the gems exhibited in the treasure display hall are also worth 5 million yuan. It is said that many magnificent buildings in the venue will only have two places that will last forever: one is the New York Building, because the mayor intends to keep it for the city hall this summer, and it may be changed to a second

Medison Park in the future; the other is a water circular theater in Fountain Lake that can accommodate 10,000 people. During the meeting, Ms. Holm, the former world sports swimming champion, and others will perform amazing water skills every day, and various beautiful fireworks will be set off there at night. The entertainment area in the meeting covers an area of ​​280 acres. The other parts of the venue are closed at 10 o'clock every night, and this area will be extended to 2 o'clock in the morning. There are various fascinating creative amusement, and another area is designated as a

children's playground. According to current estimates, the average cost per person for visitors from outside New York is 100 yuan, which will cost approximately 150 million yuan. The distribution of its uses is as follows: entertainment 32.5 million yuan, food and drink 32.5 million yuan, accommodation 30 million yuan, shopping 20 million yuan, city transportation 15 million yuan, personnel 7.5 million yuan, transportation 1.5 million yuan; however, the authorities also give visitors various preferential treatments. For example, those who want to visit the exhibitions in New York and San Francisco will have special fare reductions. The railway company also announced a special round-trip fare for those who visit the two meetings, and stipulated that the round-trip fare around the United States for a week will only cost 90 yuan, and the public bus will be even cheaper at 70 yuan (Reuters 16 New York electric).

### "Public Affairs" and "Private Friendship"

— Xin Liang

There is probably no need for the author to explain in detail the two terms "public affairs" and "private friendship". Readers can understand them clearly. The so-called "public affairs" specifically refers to the duties performed by general state government public institutions and public groups such as foreign firms, banks, merchants, and shops; therefore, in fact, we can also call "public affairs" "public duties". The so-called "private friendship" naturally refers to matters related to individuals in general or private feelings. Directly from the words of these two terms, we should know that "public affairs" and "private friendship" are two completely different things. We cannot use "public affairs" to discuss "private friendship", nor can we use "private friendship" to discuss "public affairs".

When we are "handling public affairs," we must have several qualities such as caution, prudence, enthusiasm, diligence, and loyalty. Especially people who are generally called "civil servants," they embody the spirit of the country and inspire all their spirit. At the very least, they should fulfill their responsibilities and everything they should do. Therefore, it can also be said that we must have a concept of "serving the public" and "sacrificing for the public" for "public affairs."

Here, please don't misunderstand. We don't need loyalty or enthusiasm for "private friendship." However, in fact, if we are a little careless with "private friendship," it really doesn't matter much, because the influence of "private friendship" is limited to the scope of private individuals. Conversely, if we are casual about "public affairs," then it will not only affect individuals, but also easily affect a large group of "the public." Therefore, we would rather use the methods and thoughts of "handling public affairs" to deal with "private friendship," but we must never use the feelings of "private friendship" to deal with "public affairs." However, in fact, there are countless people who ignore the true meaning of these few sentences and often combine "public affairs" and "private friendship." They will say: "Don't you even give me this face? To hell with 'public affairs' or not, you should help me with this one favor!" And the so-called "civil servants" will also answer with answers like "What's the matter!" So, in this situation, the larger ones succeed in actions that mislead the country and the people, and the smaller ones have evil things such as theft, robbery, and embezzlement... In short, people in general value "private friendship" too much, and shatter the dignity of "public affairs" into pieces.

Now, I want to point out that these habits of "private friendship" and "public affairs" are not acceptable: especially when our motherland is in a difficult career, may I ask, should we neglect "public affairs" for the sake of some face relationship, and cause great harm to the general public? Therefore, here, I sincerely hope that every Chinese national can extensively promote the spirit of "sacrificing for the public." We must know that today is not a time to value "feelings" or "private friendship." We should focus on "public affairs", work for "the public" and for "the country", and earnestly do some work in the war of resistance!

### "A Decisive Battle"

— Yang Mei

The War of Resistance has now lasted twenty-one months. Although Japan has relied on the superiority of its military equipment to achieve victories in form, it has only gained a few lines of communication and a few cities. Vast areas of land are still in the hands of the Chinese army, and the front line is unusually long and scattered. This violates the military taboo of deep incursions. If a full-scale counter-offensive is launched, and all areas are ambushed, communication will be cut off, the head and tail cannot support each other, it will inevitably lead to the result of collapse. However, when Japan launched the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, it originally wanted to gain some small advantages, but it never expected to receive the most fatal retaliation of "long-term resistance." As the war has progressed to the present, it has sunk deeper and deeper into the mire, and its predicament is fully exposed. Its regular army, reserve army, and Korean and Taiwanese troops have all been deployed to the front lines to fight, and it still feels that it is not enough. In its own "royal paradise," it keeps running into Chinese troops, gaining this piece and losing that piece, becoming dizzy and exhausted. It can be seen that the collapse of the Japanese army is not far away. We can get stronger proof from the following telegram.

According to a recent report in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Major General Sakura Yoshi, commander of the Japanese army in Central China, declared: "Please let the Chinese government send elite troops to the Central Plains for a decisive battle, and stop scurrying around, losing national dignity."

Major General Sakura Yoshi's declaration coincides with the words of Ando, commander of the Japanese army in South China, on December 19 last year, "I wish Chairman Chiang would come to Guangdong as a soldier for a final battle." They echo each other, showing that they have reached a dead end and are not far from collapse!

The French-language Shanghai Japanese Daily once said that after General Joffre was defeated in Belgium during the European War, he retreated completely and eventually achieved an unprecedented victory on the Marne River. This is an accurate and irrefutable argument. The victories of the counter-offensive in various parts of Central China in the past few days are like breaking bamboo. This is the prelude to the transformation from defeat to victory in the second stage of the War of Resistance!

From this, we know that Sakura Yoshi's declaration is nothing more than a wail before collapse.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter 8: Is it Illusion or Reality, Playing a Part? Should We Go or Stop? Home is Everywhere

When Zhu Ai-ren received Wu Junsu's phone call, she discussed with the two Miss He's, should we go or not? When they were appraising things in Suzhou, Wu Junsu had already made an appointment, and they had promised her, "We will definitely come! We will definitely come!" How can they say they won't go now? Moreover, He Liyu and the others also liked to watch school plays. When they were in America, they had also acted in school. Zhu Ai-ren was really busy with medical affairs and had no time for this, but it wasn't that she didn't like entertainment. Their original plan was to go to Freedom Village on Sunday morning. Wu Junsu's call was about a play on Saturday night. Saturday night was originally for rest and entertainment, and wouldn't interfere with work. But after watching the play, would they return to Anle Town late at night? Wu Junsu would definitely keep them there and not let them return. When asked, Wu Junsu indeed said on the phone: "Everything is prepared for you. If you don't mind the neglect, just stay at my place. Moreover, I have already invited Sister Yun. She is also staying here with me. We can have a long night's talk. I hope you come earlier and have dinner at my place. After dinner, we can go to the play." She had made such an arrangement on the phone, it seemed that they couldn't refuse. They calculated that they could only arrive in Suzhou on Saturday afternoon and stay at Wu Junsu's place. Then, on Sunday, they could go from Suzhou to Freedom Village, which wouldn't be a problem. So, they agreed to Wu Junsu that they would definitely come on Saturday afternoon. Wu Junsu was of course happy and urged them to come for dinner and not be too late. The next day was Saturday. Zhu Ai-ren finished the day's work at the hospital. At about four o'clock in the afternoon, they still took Zhu Ai-ren's car and came to Soochow University in Suzhou. When they arrived in Suzhou, it was still early, but the setting sun was already hanging over the treetops. They found Wu Junsu's residence. It turned out that Wu Junsu's family all lived in Shanghai, but she lived near the school alone. Because many small Western-style houses were built around Soochow University. These small Western-style houses all had gardens. The school had built these houses for the faculty to live in. The houses were three stories high, not very large, but comfortable enough for a small family to live in. People who worked at Soochow University, some rented a house together, and some occupied a house alone. Although they also charged them some rent, it was very low, almost only half price. All the equipment was also very complete, such as electric lights, telephones, water pipes, radiators, etc., everything was available. This was the school's preferential treatment for these teachers.

### The Upside-Down Theater: A Changing Profession for Actors (Part 1)

— Nanqiang Beidiaoren

As the saying goes, "A restless horse changes professions ten times." Another saying goes, "Every profession produces a champion." The change of profession I am talking about is not about people in the Peking opera world abandoning acting and engaging in other industries, but about changing roles within the sheng (male), dan (female), jing (painted-face male), and chou (clown) roles in the acting world. I will not talk about those who have gone far, but will pick a few who are currently in the limelight to talk about.

Li Guichun, formerly called Xiao Dazi, originally sang Qinqiang laosheng (old male role). Because he had been singing bangzi (clapper opera) for half his life and couldn't sing it well, he changed to erhuang (a type of opera aria). He was proficient in both civil and military roles, but because he was too rough, he was not valued by connoisseurs.

Bai Yukun started as a wudan (female martial role), with the stage name Xiao Jiangzhou. Later, he changed to wusheng (male martial role). His spear skills had traces of his wudan training. Later, he also sang laosheng arias.

Han Jinkui, currently the backstage manager of the Golden Grand Theater, is a disciple of Zhang Guotai. He started as a heitou (painted-face male role), called Xiao Jinkui. After his voice broke, he changed to xiaochou (clown role) and changed his name to the current one.

Wu Guifen, currently the backstage director of the Xiao Guang Sai Theater, is a disciple of Dong Dechun (i.e., Dong Zhiyang's father). He started as a xusheng (bearded male role), named Wu Yuqing, with the stage name Xiao Guifen. Later, he changed to wusheng, but was not popular. He then changed back to laosheng and now also plays laodan (old female role) and xiaochou.

Cai Shusen, formerly named Xiao Yifang, sang xusheng arias. After his voice broke, he went north and joined the Fu Liancheng troupe, changing to wusheng. He was known for his performance in "The Leopard of Money." Recently, he has been proficient in both civil and military roles, but he doesn't perform many wusheng plays, and is still known for his aria plays and hongsheng (red-faced male role) plays.

Liu Kunrong used to be a bangzi huadan (female role), called Bai Xuanfeng. Later, he changed to wusheng, then xusheng, and then xiaosheng (young male role) and hualian (painted-face role). He is currently with the Grand Theater.

Mao Yunke originally sang laosheng, and also played xiaosheng and hualian. Later, he played huadan (female role), wusheng, and laodan. Recently, as he has gotten older, he has returned to playing male roles.

Zhao Junyu started as a xusheng and also played huamian (painted-face). He was called Da Da Kuiguan. After his voice broke, he changed to wusheng, then xiaosheng and qingyi (serious female role) and huadan. Although he is now playing female roles, he still plays xiaosheng roles. He recently performed in Kunming with Zhao Ruquan.

Li Qinxian is a famous modern teacher, also named Qin Xuan. He is a disciple of Lü Yueqiao. He sang heitou under the name "Hai'er Hong." After his voice broke, he learned qingyi from Wu Yuehua. Now, because of his age, he makes a living by teaching students.

Wang Heyun is currently with the Grand Theater. He originally learned wudan and later changed to wu jing (martial painted-face role).

Ni Jinli originally learned xiaosheng. His fan skills were quite impressive. Later, he changed to wu jing and is now with the Tianchan Theater.

He Runchu, a disciple of Shao Jizhou, studied with the famous amateur actor Xu Heizhen. He originally sang xusheng with his brother He Yixin (i.e., the father of He Yurong, the female xusheng actress at the Great World Qiankun Theater, who is now deceased). Later, he changed to laodan and was taught by Ren Changhai. He has been with the Grand Theater for a long time.

Yao Yufu originally sang xusheng and later changed to huashan (female role). People only know that he was Mei Lanfang's long-time partner, but who knows that he started as a laosheng? He is now in the old capital.

Xiao Yang Yuelou originally sang xusheng, known for "Li Ling's Monument" and "Wenzhao Pass." After his voice broke, he changed to huadan.

Liu Zhenting originally sang erhuang huadan, stage name Zijin Xian, and was the son-in-law of the famous painted-face actor Liu Yongchun. Later, he changed to xusheng, then gradually changed to xiaosheng and laodan. Zhao Ruquan recruited him for the continuous performance of "The Case of Peng Gong" at the Samsung Stage, and changed his name to the current one. He is now with the Grand Theater.

Wang Fengqing originally sang xiaosheng and later changed to xusheng, following the Gui Fen style. He is now living in the old capital and rarely performs on stage due to his age.

### Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat

— Yanran

In "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat," in addition to implying the snobbery of the social environment and the difficulty of making a living, its gags are also very capable of making the general audience laugh until their stomachs hurt.

For example, when Mr. Wang was teaching at a girls' middle school, he actually read aloud the "Classic of Filial Piety for Women" and recited the "Three Obediences and Four Virtues for Women: at home, obey your father; when married, obey your husband; when your husband dies, obey your son..." The rotten tune actually put all the girls in the classroom to sleep. When the principal came in, he woke up as if from a dream and realized that the students had all fallen asleep. This shows that education must grasp the needs of the times in order to arouse students' interest.

In the scene where Mr. Wang has difficulty making a living and wants to commit suicide, he hangs a rope from the beam, then puts it under his chin, kicks away the stool under his feet, and makes various poses while his body is swaying in the air. In this scene, the audience really burst into laughter.

In the face of utter despair, Mr. Wang suddenly receives a letter from his friend Xiao Chen, introducing him to be the secretary of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. This really made him extremely happy. He even jumped up and down in the room with laughter, jumping around several times, and constantly singing ditties in his mouth. The vivid expression truly described the joy of an unemployed person once he gets a job.

When he walked into the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the usher was initially snobbish, then respectful, and finally, because he lost his letter of introduction and could not produce any real evidence, he showed a snobbish face again and tried to drive him out. This back-and-forth performance thoroughly exposed the snobbery of people's hearts and the fickleness of the world. While we can't help but laugh, we should also regard it as social philosophy.

Throughout the play, Tang Jie's portrayal of Mr. Wang can be said to be the most energetic. You Guangzhao's portrayal of the usher is also just right, full of humor. The expressions of the other actors can also be said to be quite successful.

In short, we should not only regard this film as a humorous film, but sometimes also as a social film. Because it really contains a lot of life philosophy and worldly experience.

Mr. Wang (Tang Jie) said: "Screenwriter, director, and leading actor, I do it all! People say I have 'a way to make money.' Heavens! Actually, it's 'hard to eat!'"

### After Hu Guang's Plea, the "Mulan Joins the Army" Negotiation is Resolved

— Yu Sheng

Moving to the New Light Theater Starting on the 21st

MGM Once Sent a Letter of Ultimatum to Hu Guang

The Hua Cheng Film Studio and the Hu Guang Grand Theater recently had a sudden negotiation. The reason was that Hua Cheng's debut work, "Mulan Joins the Army," was still selling more than 2,200 yuan per day. The contract between Hua Cheng and Hu Guang stated that the film could only be withdrawn and stopped showing if the daily ticket sales were less than 1,000 yuan. However, Hu Guang also had a contract with MGM. Because "Mulan Joins the Army" had been showing for more than two months, MGM's films had been piling up since coming down from the Da Guangming Theater, with six or seven films in stock, resulting in no small losses. Recently, MGM even sent a letter of ultimatum to Hu Guang, stating that if MGM's films were not scheduled quickly, then in addition to tearing up the contract, Hu Guang would have to compensate for a loss of 60,000 yuan. As a result, the Hu Guang authorities felt very difficult and had to shorten the showing period of "Mulan Joins the Army," scheduled to end on the 20th, and at the same time published farewell commemorative words in the advertisement. Hua Cheng believed that Hu Guang had violated the contract because it was not yet time to withdraw the film according to the contract, so it filed a negotiation with Hu Guang and published a warning in the newspaper. Hu Guang found it difficult to resolve this, so it specially consulted with the Hua Cheng authorities. It is said that as a result of Hu Guang's sincere plea, Hua Cheng, taking into account Hu Guang's predicament, had accepted Hu Guang's request. "Mulan Joins the Army" was decided to be shown until the 20th, and starting on the 21st, it would be screened at the New Light Grand Theater, thus bringing the negotiation to a conclusion. As a result, Hu Guang also scheduled to change to Western films starting on the 20th? The first film is "Sweethearts" starring Jeanette MacDonald.

The New Light Grand Theater has recently been showing the humorous film "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat," directed and starring Tang Jie, which has been selling very well. However, because "Mulan Joins the Army" is coming, it has to "give way" temporarily and re-screen "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat" after "Mulan Joins the Army" has finished showing. Some people say: This is "Hua Mulan eating Mr. Pang Wang." One

### Entertainment News

The 34th installment of "Journey to the West" at the Xin Ji Grand Theater has been started by Zhang Baiyun. The other day, backstage manager Liu Kunrong, Zhang Yipeng, Liu Zhenting, Liu Fenghai and others held a big meeting to discuss the plot.

◇ The famous painted-face actor Li Kechang went to the Great World with friends the other night and visited Zhang Luo, Wang Daigong and other old friends backstage at the Lianyou Society. He said that he had not returned to his hometown for three years and planned to resign from the Golden Theater and return north.

◇ Gu Wuwei is scheduled to return to Hong Kong today. According to him, he may go to Chongqing, otherwise he may resume film work.

◇ The clown Yang Yushan, due to being stimulated, became mentally disordered and left a note and ran away. Now Yang Jingren has found him on Danshui Road. He had tried to commit suicide and was saved by someone. He was fortunate to be reborn. This drastic measure was caused by worries about the times.

◇ Chen Dabei's "Pipa Record" has been more than half filmed by Xinhua Company. Now Chen is writing a complete "Xi Shi," with Yuan Meiyun designated to play Xi Shi and Jin Yan to play Fan Li, with extremely grand scenes.

◇ The Lianyou Drama Society's public performance of "Inevitably Affectionate" by He Jinglu has been very popular with the audience. Now He Jun will continue to arrange the second installment, but change the name of the play to "The Death of an Actress," the plot of which is more tense and moving than "Inevitably Affectionate."

### "Mysterious Lady": A Unique Style

In the past, Zheng Zhengqiu's "Sister Flowers" was continuously screened at the New Light Theater for dozens of days and did not decline. Filmmakers gathered to study it. At that time, many "bitter films" were successively released, but scarcity makes the heart grow fonder. When there are too many things, the audience also feels bored. This is exactly the same as the current costume films. After the war, due to the difficulty of finding material, domestic films had to lean towards historical dramas and stage plays, which gradually made the audience feel bitter. We believe that if we want to improve domestic films, we should abandon the consistent style to the extreme. If "Shadow City Record" is known for its new style and is praised by movie fans, then the new film "Mysterious Lady," according to writer-director Wen Yimin, is a unique work of recent times, and the whole play is full of emotion and the performance is quite desolate. We are tired of seeing old tricks, and we have a deeper expectation for this "Mysterious Lady." It is also said that the film will be released soon.

A Textual Research on the Plot of "Four Jinshi"

Several days ago, I received a letter from a reader asking me to write a simple explanation of the story of each play so that readers can be more easily interested. He said that most of our country's plays are based on "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "The States of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty," "Water Margin," "The Case of Peng Gong," "The Little Five Righteous Men," and other novels. The above books are all well known, so there is no need to explain them. If the "Four Jinshi" has too many characters on stage and the plot is very complicated, those who are familiar with this play can certainly understand the whole story, but for the sake of readers who do not often set foot in the theater, I will briefly describe the story of the play so that they can understand the meaning of this article. In the future, if I encounter similar plots, I will also describe their outlines.

During the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, there were four jinshi (successful candidates in the highest imperial examinations) named Mao, Gu, Tian, and Liu, all of whom were on the same list. At that time, Yan Song monopolized power, and they had not been sent out to serve as officials for a long time. So they went to Shuangta Temple to swear an oath before Emperor Wenchang, vowing to be honest and upright officials. Later, they were recommended by their teacher Hai Rui, and they were successively sent out to serve as officials. Liu was appointed as the magistrate of Shangcai County, Henan Province, and Gu Du was appointed as the commissioner of Ruguang Road, Henan Province, and concurrently managed the main hall of Xinyang Prefecture. Mao Peng was specially appointed as the inspector of Henan Province, but Tian Lun, although he was also appointed as the inspector of Jiangxi Province, had not yet received his credentials to take office, so he lived alone in his hometown. At that time, there was a wealthy household named Yao Tingchun in Shangcai County, whose wife, née Tian, was unusually fierce. Tian was the elder sister of the jinshi Tian. Because she was angry that her parents-in-law favored her nephew Tingmei, she plotted to poison Tingmei and tricked his sister-in-law Yang Suzhen into selling herself as a wife to Yang Chun, a foreigner. Yang learned the whole story and acted righteously to help Suzhen avenge her grievances and became sworn siblings. At that time, Inspector Mao happened to be passing through Liulin disguised as a fortune teller, so he wrote a petition for Suzhen and told her to appeal to a higher court, because Mao knew that Magistrate Liu would be partial to Tian because of their fellow student relationship. The two siblings planned to go to the Ruguang Road court together to file a complaint, but they were separated on the way. Suzhen was fortunate enough to be rescued by Song Shijie, who adopted her as his goddaughter. Song was a famous litigator, so he went to the Road court to appeal. Gu Du was quite honest and upright at first, but later he received a secret letter from Tian Lun asking for his help. Although he wanted to refuse, the three hundred taels of silver in the letter was taken away by his secretary. Since Gu had no money to return, he suddenly changed his original intention and made a wrongful judgment, scolding Shijie in the court and throwing Suzhen into prison. Unexpectedly, Shijie had learned the truth about Tian and Gu's bribery from the secret letter brought by the scribe in his inn the day before, and had secretly recorded the words in the letter on his clothes. Now that he saw Gu suddenly overturned the previous case, he knew that he had been bribed, so he appealed again to Inspector Mao. At this point, the evidence was complete, and Mao sentenced the three jinshi Tian, Gu, and Liu, and née Tian, to death.
