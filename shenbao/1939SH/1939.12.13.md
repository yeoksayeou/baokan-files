Chongqing: Four brothers, Wang Quanyang, Wang Quanchun, Wang Dagou, and Wang Yuangen, all from Fen Shui County, Zhejiang Province, were all drawn as Class A conscripts. They decided to undergo short-term military training. According to regulations, half of the four brothers should enlist in the army. However, based on the order of the lottery numbers, it would take months or even years before they would be conscripted. However, the conscripts, led by Wang Quanyang, were filled with righteous indignation and specifically went to the county government to volunteer, requesting to be sent to the front lines. After being inspected and deemed qualified by the county government, they were transferred to temporary training and ordered to be treated well.

### A Glimpse of the Achievements of the Chinese Army's Demolition Team

Editorial

### A Bird's-Eye View of the Guangdong-Guangxi War

The Japanese army captured Nanning and advanced north in two directions, one along the Yongbin Highway towards Binyang and the other along the Yongwu Highway towards Wuming. On the Yongbin line, the Chinese and Japanese armies are stalemated between Yongning and Qitang. On the Yongwu line, they are stalemated between Yongning and Gaofengao. Although the full-scale battle has yet to unfold, observers predict that the most intense war will be fought in the mountains of Guangxi. Both China and Japan have dispatched reinforcements to the front and have deployed their lines in preparation for an offensive. Therefore, the Japanese occupation of Nanning is the beginning of the southern Guangxi war, not the completion of its war aim. From Beihai and the Qinzhou Bay, where the Japanese landed, to Nanning is less than 100 miles; utilizing the power of their army, navy, and air force, they could easily advance, but north of Nanning, it would be difficult to penetrate deep. The center of military gravity is in the suburbs of Nanning, but the military maneuvering of both sides and the mutual restraint between them causes ripples to spread across both Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. On the Yuehan Railway line, the Japanese remotely echo southern Guangdong, attempting to invade Yinzhanao from Lubaohua County, opening up the Yuehan Railway, moving north towards Hunan, and west towards Guangxi. This strategy has been crushed by the Chinese army. In the West River area, the Japanese wanted to pass through Zhaoqing Gorge from Sanshui and move north towards Cangwu to reinforce Nanning, but the Japanese army has never crossed the Sanshui line. As for eastern Guangdong, the Japanese used puppet troops to move from Chenghai to Huanggang, which belongs to Raoping, crossing Fenshui Pass and attacking Zhaoan in southern Fujian. Zhaoan was once occupied by the Japanese and puppet troops, but after strenuous counterattacks by the Chinese army and intercepting the enemy along the way, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Chenghai. Currently, the Chinese armies in Guangdong and Fujian have established contact. There is no trace of the Japanese army in the Fenshui Pass area on the border between Guangdong and Fujian. The Japanese utilization of bandits and puppets to invade Fujian, supposing they advanced along the highway and occupied the important towns of Zhangzhou in southern Fujian, based on the lack of naval activity in northern Fujian, appears to be pending. Therefore, the actual purpose of the Japanese is likely to support the war in southern Guangxi and divert the attention of the Chinese army, while the main purpose is not in southern Fujian.

The above is regarding the actions of the Japanese army. As for the Chinese army, it is also responding tit-for-tat and standing up against them. The main strategy of the Chinese army is to turn the rear of the Japanese army into the front. The area occupied by the Japanese army from Qinzhou Bay to Nanning is a narrow corridor. Although Qinzhou and Fangcheng have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, the Leizhou Peninsula and Lingshan County still have strong Chinese armies stationed there. If these troops are dispatched to the rear of the Japanese army, there will surely come a day when the Japanese corridor is cut off. Currently, a strong branch of the Chinese army in Lingshan, western Guangdong, is moving east, hoping to cut off the highway and recapture Qinzhou County. They have now recovered Xiaodong on the Guangdong-Guangxi border. Another strong branch of the Chinese army set off from Hepu and is advancing towards Qinzhou County. The two armies joined forces to attack and have now approached the suburbs of Qinzhou County. Regardless of whether this force can capture Qinzhou and Fangcheng in one fell swoop, cutting off the Japanese army's rear, these troops, by traveling back and forth behind the Japanese army and destroying transportation lines, will surely exhaust the Japanese army. The loss of one city or place is not enough to determine the overall situation. The loss of Nanning is just an empty city, with no manpower or material resources left. Since the Japanese army entered Nanning, they have had heavy troops counterattacking in front and an ambushing army in the rear. Not only will the Japanese army fail to achieve its goal of cutting off the Guangxi-Vietnam transportation line, but it will also be impossible to maintain transportation to and from its own front and rear. Therefore, it is no different than climbing a tree to catch fish for the Japanese army to penetrate deep into Guangxi, breaking through the Kunlun Pass, a strategic region, on the Yongbin line to the north, moving south along the highway to seize Longzhou, cutting off the Guangxi-Vietnam line, and invading Yunnan along Baise in the west to cut off the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Japanese Prime Minister Abe recently gave a speech at a banquet in Osaka, saying that Chiang Kai-shek commands at least 240 divisions and that there are also one million guerrillas rampaging everywhere. He then urged the nation to prepare for a war lasting five to ten years. This means that although Japan has obtained Nanning, it has not gained any decisive strategic significance. On the contrary, it has taken a risk, further stretching the battle lines and adding another layer of difficulty to its troop deployment and supply. If China, in the Guangxi-South Campaign, uses a strong military force to hold the strategic area of Kunlun Pass on the Yongbin road, and sends troops from various places in southern Guangdong to the rear of the Japanese army, then the Japanese army, venturing deep, will be destined to fail. General Bai Chongxi's remarks yesterday that Nanning can be recovered and the Japanese army annihilated at any time are indeed possible and are definitely not just boasting!

### League of Nations Cables Soviet Union, Requests Ceasefire, Enters Conciliatory Negotiations, Dispatches Representatives to Attend the General Assembly, and Hopes to Submit a Reply Today

Geneva: The Swedish representative recently suggested to the League of Nations General Assembly that a telegram be sent to the Soviet government requesting it to dispatch representatives to the meeting on the 13th of this month to discuss the application submitted by Finland. The Committee on Finnish Affairs organized by the General Assembly then unanimously resolved to send a telegram to the Soviet government requesting it to cease hostilities and dispatch representatives to attend the General Assembly on the 13th of this month in order to conduct peace talks with Finland under the auspices of the League of Nations, and hoped that the Soviet Union would submit a response before the 13th of this month. (11th Havas dispatch)

Geneva: The League of Nations General Assembly today designated 13 countries to form a committee on the Soviet-Finnish dispute, without inviting China to participate. After the committee was established, it immediately accepted the British proposal to send a telegram to the Soviet government requesting it to immediately cease the war and send representatives to Geneva so that it could negotiate with Finland under the mediation of the League of Nations. When the British put forward this proposal, the French representative immediately expressed his approval. The committee also requested the Soviet Union to reply within 24 hours. Soviet semi-official sources here said that the committee's telegram was tantamount to an ultimatum. (12th Special dispatch)

Geneva: The League of Nations General Assembly reconvened last night. Chairman Norwegian representative Hambro stated that all representatives must be prepared to meet at any time, day or night, in order to deal with the situation after receiving the Soviet Union's reply. Before the meeting, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Denmark sent a letter to the chairman stating that because the League of Nations General Assembly was convened specifically for a certain designated political event, it did not intend to participate in discussions on other political issues. (12th Reuters dispatch)

Geneva: Gu Weijun, the chief Chinese representative to the League of Nations, said today that Britain and France both agree that China should be re-elected as a member of the League of Nations Council. According to the League of Nations charter, those elected as council members must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly. However, this General Assembly intends to simplify the original procedure, and China's re-election as a council member is almost certain. This morning, the General Assembly appointed Hu Shize, the Chinese Minister to Switzerland, as one of the nine members of the Review Committee, which was beyond general expectations. The press circles of various countries here said that this matter is sufficient to indicate that the League of Nations' sympathy for China has not changed. Regarding the expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League, opinions are divided. South American countries strongly advocate the expulsion of the Soviet Union, while Scandinavian countries only advocate condemning the Soviet Union and providing practical assistance to Finland. Britain agrees with the views of the Scandinavian countries, and France's attitude is the same as Britain's. Britain believes that expelling the Soviet Union will promote close cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany and reduce the effectiveness of the Allied blockade policy. The Finnish representative also does not want to expel the Soviet Union, so that the Soviet Union and Finland can still hold negotiations or be mediated by other countries. (12th Special dispatch)

### Finnish Representative's Speech Requests Practical Assistance

Geneva: The League of Nations General Assembly held its second meeting at 4:45 pm this afternoon to discuss the application submitted by the Finnish government and immediately decided to accept it. Holsti, the representative of the country, then delivered a speech amidst warm applause from representatives of various countries, recounting the period from the beginning of the Soviet army's invasion on the 30th of last month until the Finnish government submitted its application, and explaining what the country expected from the League of Nations. He said, "In the past, the Soviet Union condemned all acts of aggression by other countries, but now it has resolutely sent troops to invade our territory. The people of our entire country are now willing to support the government and resist. What we seek is not only the sympathy of various countries but also practical assistance. Our country's strength alone cannot resist the Soviet army. Finland is not only fighting for its own survival but also for the highest ideals of all nations in the world. Based on this position, we call on all countries to provide material assistance." The General Assembly then designated representatives from 13 countries, Britain, France, Uruguay, Bolivia, South Ireland, Egypt, Portugal, Venezuela, Siam, Sweden, Norway, Canada, and India, to form a committee to study this application. (11th Havas dispatch)

### Committee Drafts Report Advocating Reconciliation

Geneva: The Committee on Finnish Affairs under the League of Nations General Assembly continued to hold meetings this morning, with Portuguese representative Damate as chairman. It immediately discussed the draft report that the General Assembly's presidium was about to submit to the General Assembly. The content detailed the course of events in which the Soviet Union and Finland engaged in hostile acts, and its conclusion supported the Swedish proposal, advocating for reconciliation between the two sides. This draft report will first seek the opinions of Finland before being submitted to the General Assembly for review. In addition, the committee is also drafting another report on the diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Finland and various legal issues, and is scheduled to hold another meeting at 5:30 pm today. (12th Havas dispatch)

### British Newspapers Express Sympathy for China's Situation

London: Today, the newspapers here expressed sympathy for China's position in Geneva and the Chinese representative's decision to abstain from voting on the Soviet-Finnish dispute. The News Chronicle reported that many countries are forced by circumstances to only consider their own interests and are unable to uphold justice. China has no reason to sympathize with aggression, but it is inconvenient to offend the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union's continued assistance to China's war of resistance is extremely important. The League of Nations can now only condemn the Soviet Union in clear terms and urge all member states to assist Finland. Although the League of Nations cannot implement military force today, it can unite the attitudes of various countries so that one day an international organization can be created with the power to take decisive action against acts of aggression, no matter where they occur. (12th Reuters dispatch)

### American Newspaper Hopes

New York. Today, all newspapers here prominently published the League of Nations' telegram to the Soviet Union and reports of Finnish victories in resistance. The New York Tribune reported that the League of Nations, after most of its most important members withdrew, now has a new atmosphere, as member states can unite dramatically. The New York Times said that even if the League of Nations cannot make any united expression, countries will still be able to ensure that Finland receives all necessary supplies. The American people greatly admire Finland's struggle for freedom and its noble international character, and believe that ways can be found to provide prompt assistance. (Reuters, 12th)

### British and French Public Opinion

London. The Finnish Committee of the League of Nations Assembly has telegraphed the Soviet government, requesting it to cease hostilities, conduct peace talks with Finland, and send representatives to the Assembly. This matter has been commented on by various newspapers here, asserting that the Soviet government will definitely refuse to accept, and the League of Nations will not necessarily impose sanctions on that country, but will only unanimously pass a resolution in the Executive Council to condemn it. (Havas, 12th)

Paris. The request from the Finnish Committee of the League of Nations Assembly to the Soviet Union to cease hostilities has been commented on by various newspapers here. There are no high expectations about how the Soviet government will respond. The right-wing Le Petit Parisien stated, "If the Soviet government does not remain silent, it will submit an arrogant reply." The moderate L'Ordre stated that if the League of Nations were to announce the Soviet Union's expulsion, it would only strengthen the collusion between Hitler and Stalin. The leader of the Socialist Party, former Prime Minister Léon Blum, also published an article in Le Populaire, stating, "The Soviet Union's invasion of Finland must be judged. If the attitudes of Britain and France show any softening, their prestige will be swept away. However, what Finland requests is practical assistance, which cannot be satisfied by empty condemnation." (Havas, 12th)

### Soviet Indifference

Moscow. This morning, Soviet newspapers completely ignored yesterday's League of Nations resolution. (Haitong, 12th)

### Italian Newspaper Ridicule

Rome. Italy's notification of its withdrawal from the League of Nations was sent on December 11, 1937, so it only takes effect today. Various newspapers here wrote articles yesterday discussing this matter, ridiculing the declining power of the League of Nations and the current Assembly. The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia stated that no one will regret the League of Nations losing its form, as the League had long lost its credibility. Il Giornale d'Italia commented that the League of Nations convening an assembly to discuss the issues of "aggression" and "sanctions" at this time is truly a twist of fate for the League. Needless to say, the current League of Nations Assembly will not have any results. (Haitong, 12th)

### Soviet Troops Continue to Advance, Finnish Defense Line Remains Intact

London. According to recent news obtained here, although battles are very fierce in front of the Finnish Mannerheim Line, the main front line remains intact. It is also reported that the number of Swedes volunteering to join the Finnish army has reached a thousand, and many have crossed the border into Finnish territory. (Reuters, 12th)

Helsinki. A Reuters special correspondent learned that Finland has only used reserve troops to resist the Soviet army so far. The elite Finnish troops are stationed behind the front line, ready to move to any location where the defense is weak. Due to a slight lack of ammunition, the Finnish army is sufficient to repel the Soviet army's attacks, but cannot engage in long-range counter-bombardment with the Soviet army. They only shoot when they are confident of hitting the target. (Reuters, 12th)

Moscow. The Leningrad Military District issued the following war report yesterday: "On December 11, Soviet troops continued to make progress on all fronts, occupying the town of Pitkyaranta on the north shore of Lake Ladoga (the terminus of the railway to Sortavala) and the villages of Silpola and Murila in the Viipuri area. The air force was inactive due to heavy low clouds." (TASS, 12th)

### Finland Releases White Paper, Announces Contents of Negotiations

Helsinki. Finland today released a white paper, disclosing for the first time the complete Soviet demands and Finnish counter-proposals, totaling thirteen documents. The demands made by the Soviet Union include: (1) Leasing the Hanko Peninsula for thirty years to establish a naval base, whose batteries, together with the batteries of the Estonian port of Paldiski, could effectively block the Gulf of Finland; (2) The right to station troops on the Hanko Peninsula; (3) Finland's cession of Hogland and other islands, as well as land on the Karelian Isthmus. The Soviet Union would provide twice the amount of territory in exchange; (4) Strengthening the Soviet-Finnish non-aggression pact and not joining any alliance hostile to the other party; (5) Mutual cancellation of the defenses of the Åland Islands, provided that no other major power participates. Finland was prepared to accept most of the above conditions, but stated that it was impossible to agree to the Soviet Union establishing a naval base on the Hanko Peninsula. The Soviet side insisted that the Hanko Peninsula was the minimum defense for Leningrad, but was willing to reduce the number of troops stationed on the island. Finland declared its determination to maintain its territorial integrity, and stated that the land proposed by the Soviet Union for exchange was not of equal value to what it demanded, and that Finland was unwilling to allow foreign countries to establish military bases on its territory. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov replied that this debate was groundless. (Reuters, 12th)

The steel and concrete used to build bunkers, forts, and shelters could build a wall one meter high and 700 kilometers long. This great project was completed by mobilizing a million soldiers for three months. In terms of the materials used, 16,500,000 square meters of barbed wire were used, weighing 65,000 tons, and 700,000 cubic meters of steel and concrete, and 4,500,000 cubic meters of soil were excavated.

### United States Adopts Cautious Attitude Towards Soviet Union, Deeply Fears Impact on Far East Situation, Hoover Leads Aid to Finland Movement

Washington. The United States Department of State is currently taking an unusually silent attitude toward the Soviet-Finnish conflict. Political figures are paying close attention to this matter, pointing out that the United States clearly sympathizes with Britain and France, and that Finland's $10 million loan is not for military purposes, but to purchase food and other goods from the United States. According to officials in the Department of the Army, Finland's plan to purchase military aircraft and arms from the United States has failed, because the arms factories replied that they had too many outstanding orders and could not sign new contracts. In fact, it is believed that this was at the behest of the Department of the Army. The reason why the United States adopted this attitude towards Finland is clearly because it does not want to worsen US-Soviet relations. Political figures in Washington believe that if the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union deteriorates, the United States' position in China will inevitably weaken. Washington political figures generally believe that after Britain's political withdrawal, the United States is the only representative of capitalist countries in the Far East to deal with Japan. Therefore, in order to maintain its huge interests in the Far East, it is unwilling to adopt a clear anti-Soviet policy. (Haitong, 12th)

(United Press, 12th)

New York. Former Republican President Hoover recently issued a statement advocating that December 17 be designated as "Finland Day," with people from all walks of life donating to relieve civilians in Finland. In addition, various newspapers commented on the Finnish issue, saying that countries may not impose collective sanctions on the Soviet Union, but may individually assist Finland. The Democratic New York Times stated that we should provide material assistance to Finland and allow it to purchase artillery and aircraft in the United States. The Republican New York Herald Tribune stated, "The League of Nations' actions this time are extremely swift and are carried out in a unanimous spirit. Since the establishment of the League of Nations, this is the first time. Whether it will be effective remains to be proven by facts. In short, Geneva has now discovered a new international atmosphere, dealing with limited problems with limited functions. Its future development has various possibilities.

### Japan's Weakness Displayed in Modern Warfare, Backwardness of Arms Industry Technology, Reliance on United States for Many Raw Materials

Washington. According to a report released today by Hu Dongyuan, a researcher at the China Economic Research Association, Japan's arms production is insufficient, so it has greatly increased its purchases of steel industry machinery in the United States. This steel industry machinery now ranks third among Japan's major imports, which are also inputs for military supplies. In other words, the first is kerosene and its by-products, and the second is scrap iron and scrap steel. According to Hu, Japan is trying its best to purchase this steel industry production machinery, which clearly shows that Japan is not only a country lacking raw materials, but also a country with the most backward technology and productivity among the leading countries in the modern world. Due to the backwardness of Japan's industrial technology status, Japan's arms production cannot be expanded, and at the same time, it affects its ability to engage in modern warfare. In order to overcome this weakness, Japan has been doing its best to develop its heavy industry in recent years. In Japan's efforts to develop its heavy industry and arms industry, American machinery is the most important. In addition, in recent years, the United States' exports to Japan have mostly been military raw materials, and the goods used in peacetime have become increasingly scarce. For example, in the first eight months of 1937, military supplies accounted for 53 percent of US goods exported to Japan, increasing to 64 percent in 1938, and to 71 percent in the first eight months of 1939. The main items were kerosene and oils, iron, scrap steel, industrial production machinery, copper, automobiles and their parts, iron blocks, aircraft and their parts, and other steel items.

### Amount of Japanese Banknotes Issued Exceeds 5 Billion, Military Notes Not Included

Tokyo. After careful investigation, "Asahi Shimbun" stated today that the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan and other banknotes linked to the Japanese yen in East Asia totaled 4,044,000,000 yen as of the end of November, compared to 2,946,000,000 yen in the same month in 1938. It is estimated that the total number of banknotes issued by various banks at the end of October this year, the Bank of Japan reached 3,650,000,000 yen, the Bank of Korea 420,000,000 yen, the Bank of Taiwan 170,000,000 yen, the Central Bank of "Manchukuo" 670,000,000 yen, the North China United Reserve Bank 367,000,000 yen, and the Inner Mongolia Bank 54,000,000 yen, totaling 5,331,000,000 yen. The military notes issued in various parts of China are not included. All of these banknotes are backed by the Bank of Japan's gold reserves. The above total is an increase of 1,370,000,000 yen compared to December 1938, and an increase of 2,198,000,000 yen compared to December 1937. (Reuters, 12th)

### Japanese Military Dissatisfaction with Cabinet: Difficult Road Ahead for Resolving the China Incident

Tokyo – Regarding the resolution of the China Incident and domestic policies, the Japanese Army, which has always actively supported the Abe Cabinet, is now showing concern and a slight level of dissatisfaction towards the Cabinet's attitude of avoiding the establishment of a Ministry of Trade and the abolition of the order guaranteeing the status of civil servants, thereby increasing the difficulties for the Japanese government. According to the independent newspaper "Miyako Shimbun," the Army fears that the Cabinet is showing "increasingly insufficient ability" to resolve various crucial domestic problems and the China Incident, as well as to adjust complex disputes with third countries. Therefore, it is expected that Minister of the Army Shunroku Hata will likely "engage in strong negotiations with the Cabinet" and urge a more proactive attitude in implementing the policies pursued by the Cabinet.

### Third Round of US-Japan Talks Imminent: Grew Receives Instructions

Washington – After carefully reviewing the Japanese proposals for US-Japan negotiations, the US State Department appears to have instructed Ambassador Grew in Japan that a third meeting between Nomura and Grew will be held soon. As for the content of the second meeting on the 4th of this month, the State Department believes that the Japanese side has shown sincerity in its willingness to adjust US-Japan relations, which the US fully acknowledges. While the Japanese side has indicated its willingness to compensate for damages to American property in China, the US is most concerned about Japan's future guarantee of American rights and interests in China, a point on which the Japanese side has made no promises. This is a matter of deep concern for the US. However, it is still hoped that the talks will continue so that the positions of both sides can gradually converge. (Domei News Agency, 11th)

### Japanese Authorities Focus on Air Defense: Underground Air Raid Shelters Planned for Three Major Cities

### German Cargo on Japanese Ship Still in Dutch Port: UK-Japan Negotiations Ongoing, Spain Protests Blockade to France

The Hague – The Japanese cargo ship "Sanyo Maru" (8,000 tons), carrying a shipment of German goods, was originally scheduled to set sail from Rotterdam on the 9th of this month, passing through the naval blockade of Britain and France to return to its home country. However, it received a telegram from Tokyo postponing its departure. According to well-informed sources here, British and Japanese authorities are negotiating the issue of blockading German exports. The "Sanyo Maru" must wait until the negotiations are concluded before setting sail. Rumors that Japanese authorities intend to use this ship to attempt to break through the blockade line of Britain and France are inaccurate. The cargo on the ship was purchased by importers from neutral countries on October 27, before Britain and France announced the blockade of German exports. Therefore, it is not subject to detention. It is evident that the ship can pass through the blockade line of Britain and France at any time before January 1 of next year, the deadline set by Britain and France, without causing any disputes. Therefore, what remains to be resolved in the negotiations between British and Japanese authorities are some crucial details. (Havas, 11th)

### Authorities Begin Thorough Investigation of Grain Hoarding in Warehouses: Special Branch of the Police Department Has Begun Operations: Flat-Price Sale of Foreign Rice Likely to Proceed Early: Japanese Side Claims Cooperation with Both Concessions to Control Rice Prices

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council issued announcements on the 10th, banning the hoarding of rice and grain and raising market prices within the concessions. If anyone violates the aforementioned behavior, the authorities will not provide protection, or even expel them, and confiscate their stockpiles. Yesterday, it was learned that the Public Concession Police Department has handed over the investigation and enforcement of this matter to the Special Branch. However, it has been decided to avoid all public publicity. A senior official of the Police Department stated yesterday that the Police Department is determined to strictly and calmly implement this new duty to alleviate the food shortage of the Chinese people within the concession. The decision not to publicize is not to be construed as a relaxation of duties. As for speculation that investigators and rice merchants will become more involved in matters, this is unfounded. Those who are criticized in the announcement are only unscrupulous merchants who hoard, and it has nothing to do with legitimate rice merchants. Hoarders are not necessarily all rice merchants. There are manipulators here who are not only not rice merchants, but not even merchants, yet they hoard rice for profit, causing rice prices to skyrocket. All such people are on the radar of the Police Department investigators. The Police Department's actions this time will not be to adopt high-handed tactics, and only those who are stubborn and refuse to comply with the warnings of the authorities of the two concessions will be subject to warnings. Therefore, the Police Department has decided not to publicize too much in order to avoid unnecessary difficulties, but to seek truth from facts in order to achieve the goal of suppressing rice prices. All sectors of society, for the sake of public interest, should report to the police authorities of the French Concession and the Public Concession if they are aware of any hoarding, speculation, or monopoly of rice and grain, so that they can be prosecuted and assisted in the investigation. This is what is hoped for.

Japanese Side Claims Assistance to Authorities

The North-China Daily News reported that an official of the Municipal Council told reporters yesterday (the 11th) that after the announcement warning rice speculators and hoarders was published, there had been no developments, and no one had reported illegal profiteers to the Municipal Council in accordance with the regulations of the announcement. Therefore, the authorities have not taken any action against rice merchants such as expelling them from the two concessions or confiscating their rice stockpiles. There are some obstacles to the import of rice into the city, but rice is still being transported from occupied areas and Saigon. It is too early to predict what will happen in the future and can only wait and see. According to a Japanese Army spokesperson yesterday, the Japanese Army authorities will fully cooperate with the efforts of the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession to control rice prices. The Japanese Army authorities will take action to increase the amount of rice imported into Shanghai and help resolve the situation.

Secret Surveillance of Warehouses Within the Concession

The concession authorities believe that the high rice prices have a major impact on the security of the city. Therefore, in addition to jointly issuing an announcement by the two concessions to stop hoarding, speculation, and monopolization of rice and grain, the Food and Fuel Supply Committee of the Municipal Council has had significant developments after days of consultations, taking decisive measures against those who manipulate food for profit. It is heard that they have now begun investigating the rice, flour, soybean oil, and other goods hoarded in various warehouses, and have secretly dispatched police to monitor several warehouses that are manipulating rice prices for profit. Once evidence is obtained, they will be punished. It is heard that many citizens have reported unscrupulous merchants to the authorities in recent days, which is very helpful to the authorities in punishing unscrupulous merchants.

Large Households Sell Off, Market Trends Stabilize

A reporter from the Datong News Agency yesterday asked a leader in the rice industry about the impact of the joint announcement by the two concessions to punish rice prices on hoarders and manipulators. According to him, the most effective aspect of the joint announcement by the two concessions is that it can cause large households to sell off one after another. The reason why Shanghai rice prices have reached unprecedented highs is that large households have absorbed the rice and grain transported to Shanghai and stored it in warehouses, waiting for a good price to sell, resulting in rising rice prices. Since the announcement by the two concessions, large rice-hoarding households, under the watchful eyes of the public, are deeply afraid of being severely punished and have no choice but to sell off as soon as possible. This allows the rice and grain transported to Shanghai to be fully supplied to the market for open buying and selling, without being manipulated by profiteers, and without being hoarded for higher prices.

Consultations on Early Flat-Price Sales and Application for Legal Foreign Exchange to Order Foreign Rice for Flat-Price Sales: The Most Effective Way to Suppress Rice Prices. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Yu Qiaqing stated that he intends to consult with the financial community within two or three days to actively carry out this matter. According to the opinion of Zhang Nianxuan, Chairman of the Rice Guild, the quality of the rice for this flat-price sale should be lower than the previous one, because rice of very good quality is more expensive, which is contrary to the purpose of helping the common people. The method of selling flat-price rice should be changed to be sold by each rice shop, which can allow the common people to buy locally and avoid crowding.

Reasons for Rice and Grain Not Being Able to Be Transported to Shanghai

According to foreign sources, the reasons why the rice-producing areas of the Sūcháng area of Jiangsu Province cannot transport rice to Shanghai are as follows: (1) There are more than one million Japanese troops in the occupied areas, and the amount of rice and grain they need each month is quite alarming and must be supplied in large quantities. (2) Rice grains have been continuously transported from Central China to Japan this year, affecting the source and making it impossible to transport large quantities to Shanghai. On the 1st of this month, another 400,000 bags of rice grains were transported to Osaka, Japan by ship. It is said that the rice was procured by the Japanese military. The above two points are the key to the lack of increase in the source of rice and grain.

Integrity and Shame Movement Issues Loyalty Announcement

The Integrity and Shame Movement initiated by all sectors of the city is now in its second day. In addition to distributing declarations to schools, groups, shops, factories, and residential areas, continuing to explain the meaning of the Integrity and Shame Movement, and promoting various corrective actions, it is particularly concerned about the fact that unscrupulous merchants in the city are hoarding rice, causing rice prices to rise, which greatly affects people's food and social security. It has issued a loyalty announcement to hoarders and rice merchants, urging them to lower rice prices in order to maintain people's food supply.

### New Kaihe Iron Gate Open for the Second Day: Great Crowd of People Entering and Exiting: People Flock to Visit: Separate Entry and Exit, Good Order

After the opening of the New Kaihe Iron Gate, yesterday was the second day. Among the residents of the Nanshi district entering and exiting, there were those who had been away from their hometowns for two years since the war. Some residents were previously limited by permits and could not enter. Now that the French Concession authorities have opened it up, they are all flocking to it. Therefore, the number of people entering and exiting Nanshi in the past two days has been very crowded. The number of French Concession tram passengers going to the 16th Pier has increased several times. It is heard that the opening has resulted in relatively good order.

Separate Entry and Exit

According to a Datong News Agency reporter who visited the New Kaihe Iron Gate yesterday morning, residents entering Nanshi from the concession or entering the concession from Nanshi were in an endless stream. In order to relieve the congestion, the French Police Department opened the small doors on both sides of the iron gate at the same time, in addition to closing the central iron gate. Those entering the concession from Nanshi must enter from the small door on the north side, and those entering Nanshi from the concession must exit from the small door on the south side.

Strict Inspection

Although the French Concession does not require permits for residents entering and exiting the iron gate, the Japanese soldiers and "Dad Road Police" standing outside the Minguo Road iron gate must have a "Nanshi Resident Permit" to be allowed to pass, and the inspection is very strict. The above-mentioned permit is printed with the words "Shanghai Special Service Agency Nanshi Branch" and the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government Nanshi District Office." At the same time, residents holding a "Pudong Resident Permit" can also enter and exit, while those holding a "Hongkou Resident Permit" are standing near the iron gate. It seems that these people are worried about whether the Hongkou "Permit" is also valid here, so they dare not try it lightly, fearing that once they are inside, they will not be able to return to the concession.

Good Order

Regarding the traffic of military vehicles, in the one hour that the Datong News Agency reporter silently observed, none were seen. Because the central iron gate is closed, and only the small doors on both sides are used, it seems difficult for vehicles to pass. It is likely that the central iron gate will be opened temporarily. There are many detectives stationed at the entrance of the small door on the north side by the French Police Department, so the order is very good. The Datong News Agency reporter then went to the Laobeimen and Nanyang Bridge iron gates to inspect, and they were still closed. It has been said that the Nanyang Bridge iron gate would be opened yesterday, but it has been proven that this is not true. According to reliable news obtained by the Xinsheng News Agency, the Xinbeimen iron gate will be opened first. The authorities have also stipulated that the New Kaihe Iron Gate will be used as an exit, and the Xinbeimen iron gate will be changed to an entrance in order to avoid affecting order. As for the sampans selling ferries on the Huangpu River, no one is taking care of them.

Vehicle Permit

The Wenshihai Daily reported on the 11th that in the past, anyone taking the New Kaihe Iron Gate from Nanshi to enter the French Concession was required to have a permit from the French Concession. It is now heard that this permit has been temporarily cancelled from December 11th. However, it is heard that the entry and exit of trucks through the New Kaihe Iron Gate is still handled as usual.

### Puppet Tax Bureau Promotes "Stamp Duty": Foreign Merchants Firmly Oppose: Establishes "Inspection Office at Customs" to Inspect Goods: Forces Goods Tax Payment Certificates to Affix Fake Stamps: Import and Export Firms Unanimously Refuse

Since Shanghai fell, the Jianghai Customs has been forced to change hands, taxes are collected in "Huaxing Coupons," and the tax collectors of the Central Bank have been forced to withdraw, with customs revenue being intercepted by Japan and stored in the Yokohama Specie Bank. Now, the "Sūzhèwǎn Tax Administration" has established an "Inspection Office at Customs" to promote its fake "Stamp Duty." Details are recorded below:

Puppet Bureau Establishes Inspection Office at Customs

After the tax collection office of the Central Bank in the Jianghai Customs Building was illegally taken over by personnel from the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank, the tax collectors of the Central Bank have all withdrawn. All customs revenue of the Jianghai Customs is handled by personnel from the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank. Now, the "Sūzhèwǎn Tax Administration" has established an inspection office at the tax collection office yesterday to carry out its so-called inspection of various consolidated tax goods for import and export, and to promote the "Reformed Government's" "Stamp Duty Stamps." It is heard that the inspection will be implemented from the 13th of this month, and personnel will begin working at the same time.

Attempt to Promote Fake "Stamp Duty"

The announcement of the "Sūzhèwǎn Tax Administration" states that "in order to make an announcement, the former Sūzhèwǎn Consolidated Tax Bureau had an office established at the customs, which was temporarily suspended due to the incident. Now, "this bureau" has agreed with the Jianghai Customs authorities to re-establish the "Inspection Office at Customs" in order to supervise various consolidated tax goods for import and export. The office will begin working on the 13th of this month. After that, all holders of the Customs Import Tax Payment Certificate and the Customs Export and Transit Tax Payment Certificate must purchase a two-fen stamp for each certificate from the "Inspection Office" and affix it to the certificate as proof for inspection."

Foreign Merchants Firmly Oppose Affixing

Yesterday, the reporter learned from relevant sources that after the Sūzhèwǎn Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to withdraw, the affixing of stamps to the Customs Import and Export and Transit Tax Payment Certificates was temporarily suspended, and each import and export merchant affixed their own stamps. The establishment of the "Inspection Office" by the puppet "Sūzhèwǎn Tax Bureau," although stipulating that each stamp is two fen, which is less than the previous four fen per stamp, is aimed at promoting its so-called "Reformed Stamps." After the issuance of the "Reformed Stamps," all sectors have uniformly refused them, resulting in no results to speak of. The foreign merchants in this port have expressed their firm opposition to this matter.

### Sincere Company Strike Resolved: Negotiations Settled Yesterday; Management Promises a Concrete Response by the 20th; All Branches to Resume Business This Morning

Over 700 junior and mid-level employees of the Nanjing Road Sincere Company's main and branch stores went on strike two days ago due to their proposed requests for improved treatment not being adopted by the authorities. During this peak winter sales season, the company suffered significant losses, and the employees themselves were also under considerable mental distress. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department dispatched Gu Bingyuan and Gao Yangen to once again negotiate a settlement with the company's management. At 8:00 PM, they reconvened with employee representatives Shen Zhilan, Wang Wei, Zhu Gongliang, Wu Mingquan, Wan Chunsheng, and Bao Beihong for tripartite discussions. A joint resolution was reached regarding the four demands put forth by the employees: (1) The request to reinstate three days of supplementary work will now be converted into a subsidy fee. If other companies increase supplementary work hours in the future, this practice will be followed. (2) A uniform subsidy of five yuan can be granted, but the exact amount must await instructions from the Hong Kong headquarters. (3) The year-end distribution of dividends will also be subject to instructions from the Hong Kong headquarters. (4) Regarding job security, the company does not offer absolute guarantees. A consensus was reached in the tripartite talks to provide a concrete response no later than the 20th of this month. With this, the strike at the company was fully resolved, and all branches resumed operations this morning. According to a company representative who spoke to a Datong News Agency reporter last night, the company is grateful for the condolences and gifts of various items from all sectors of society during the strike. They will strive to live up to public expectations.

### Telegraph Bureau Employees Demand Pay Raise

Messengers at the Great Northern Telegraph Company (Danish), the Great Eastern Telegraph Company (British), and the Pacific Telegraph Company (American), located on Edward Road, jointly submitted a petition to the three companies yesterday. They pointed out that since the three companies withdrew from the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the International Wireless Radio Station, business has increased severalfold, and the companies have all made profits. Furthermore, prices are rising daily, making life difficult. Therefore, they requested that the three companies consider increasing salaries and providing rice subsidies. It is reported that the company authorities will provide a satisfactory response to all messenger requests within a few days.

### Fake Police Cross Border, Intercepted by Police; Mistakenly Enter Robison Road; Depart After Persuasion

According to the English-language *China Press*, a team of police officers from the Dadao (Greater Shanghai Municipality) Police First Unit mistakenly went down Robison Road yesterday (the 11th) morning and were intercepted by police officers from the Public Concession. Onlookers expected a conflict to arise, but no dispute occurred. Subsequently, patrols from the U.S. Marine Corps repeatedly patrolled the area to guide any other errant Dadao police officers. Initially, the armed Dadao police team was not stopped at the large iron gate on the Public Concession border, a quarter of a mile west of Jessfield Road. They were only stopped and dissuaded by police officers stationed near the post after proceeding down Robison Road. The Dadao police officers left several minutes later. Because Robison Road is within their defense zone, the U.S. Marine Corps sent troops to assist the police, repeatedly patrolling in front of the iron gate on Robison Road. No incidents occurred.

### Rumor: Fake Court to Prosecute Two Chinese Detectives; "Crimes" Allegedly to Be Announced Tomorrow

According to the English-language *China Press*, the Japanese-run *New Shenbao* reported today (the 12th) that the "prosecutor" of the "Shanghai West Branch of the Local Court," under Japanese protection, has prepared indictments against two Chinese detectives from the Public Concession who were arrested by Japanese soldiers. The full text will be announced tomorrow. However, the specific crimes of which the two detectives are accused have not been disclosed. (Note: The two Chinese detectives are numbers 1210 and 1650.) They were detained by the Japanese on Robison Road on the 19th of last month, along with Western detective Eagar and a female inspector. However, Eagar and the female inspector were released after being detained for five hours.

### Sale of "Military Currency" on Suzhou Creek Apparently Directed Behind the Scenes; Conducted by Those with Financial Resources; Increased Activity Recently, Deserving Attention

According to the *North-China Daily News*, since the Japanese forcibly implemented the use of military currency in the occupied areas of Central China, those exchanging military currency on the bridges over Suzhou Creek have become increasingly active. There are clearly individuals directing this behind the scenes, but reporters have been unable to identify them. It is reported that both Chinese and Japanese individuals associated with the new political regime are closely monitoring the exchange of military currency. A reporter who visited the North Sichuan Road Bridge yesterday observed that these exchangers were

Conducting Frequent Transactions

Using legal tender to exchange, with a premium ranging from 25 to 40 cents. These individuals stood at the head of the bridge, like ticket collectors, asking those crossing into the interior if they had military currency. This is because trains, buses, and Japanese stores in the occupied areas only accept military currency. The exchange rate is 1.32 yuan in legal tender for one yuan of Japanese military currency. In essence, Chinese people holding legal tender and entering the occupied interior will

Suffer Losses

However, these military currency exchangers can hardly be described as illegal profiteers, as they are like other small vendors, earning a meager profit to make a living. According to investigations, these exchangers earn 5 to 7 cents per yuan exchanged, depending on the size of the transaction. If someone exchanges several yuan of military currency, the exchange rate may be 1.40 yuan in legal tender. If the amount exchanged is large, the exchange rate may decrease to 1.30 yuan in legal tender. Exchange shops on Sichuan Road do not exchange small amounts of military currency, only conducting

Large Transactions

For example, exchanging 1,000 yuan of military currency requires over 1,200 yuan in legal tender. There are approximately 50 individuals exchanging military currency on the bridge. These individuals admit that there are individuals with greater financial resources directing them behind the scenes, but they are unwilling to reveal the names of these individuals. They have been engaged in this small-scale business for several months, but have become more active recently because the Japanese are forcing the circulation of military currency in the occupied areas, requiring travelers to use this type of paper money to purchase train tickets, etc. These individuals also exchange smaller denominations of military currency and warn travelers not to use military currency in areas controlled by guerrillas.

### Returned Overseas Chinese Unable to Find Work; Travel Back to Native Place Together by Ship

A total of over 300 Zhejiang natives, who were overseas Chinese returning home after losing their jobs due to the impact of the European war, have arrived in Shanghai in succession. A portion of them had already left for Ningbo in batches by ship last month, to return to their hometowns. It is now learned that over eighty of them originally planned to find employment in Shanghai, but after a month of trying various methods, they were unable to obtain any suitable jobs. Furthermore, most of them were staying in hotels, incurring significant daily expenses. Therefore, they boarded the *Haifu* and *Haida* ships together the day before yesterday to go to Ningbo, and then return to their hometowns in Wenzhou and Qingtian.

### Public Works Department Budget Deficit; Studying Ways to Make Up; Tax Increase Inevitable but Not Yet Determined; Details of Loans Can Only Be Announced at Year-End

According to the English-language *China Press*, Stirling Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told reporters this morning (the 12th) that as a result of the Public Works Department's estimated deficit of over six million yuan this year, an increase in taxes in the Public Concession would soon be necessary. Fessenden stated that he was referring to the Public Works Department's treasurer's report, which contained everything. The full report on the Public Works Department's financial situation for this year was being published at this time

To Inform the Public of the Situation. The Public Works Department's Finance Committee would soon prepare the financial report and budget for the next year and would attempt to obtain assistance from the treasurer to resolve the difficulties. A significant deficit would inevitably lead to an increase in taxes within the Public Concession, but this was something the Finance Committee would study. It would be wrong for him to predict the committee's decisions. The reporter pointed out that the detailed report on the Public Works Department's

Debt Report

Was not included in this year's budget financial report. Fessenden claimed that he had nothing to say about the Public Works Department's loans. The Public Works Department considered loans to be "fixed" debt and therefore had not published detailed reports on loans. The details of the Bureau's loans would only be announced at the end of the year. Fessenden then reiterated his belief that as a result of this year's significant deficit, the

Solution

Was only to increase taxes, but this matter would be decided by the Finance Committee after the treasurer of the Public Works Department made recommendations. The item regarding "Eastern District Revival" in the budget financial report did not refer to the Public Works Department's recent sale of its buildings and properties in the northern part of the Public Concession, but only referred to residents returning to the area to rebuild houses and residences.

### Memorial Service for Ma Xiangbo Postponed; Preparatory Committee Resolved Yesterday; Postponed Until Saturday Next Month

The Shanghai Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for Ma Xiangbo has been actively carrying out memorial activities since its establishment on the 8th of last month. The memorial service was originally scheduled to be held on the 29th of this month, but due to the complexity of the affairs, it was feared that it would not be possible to hold it on that day. In order to redetermine the date of the memorial service and the method of carrying it out, the committee held a joint meeting of all groups at the Banking Club at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than 40 representatives from each group attended and elected Li Wenjie as chairman. First, Mr. Li reported on the establishment of the committee, the committee's rules and regulations, organizational system, and the names of the members of each group. Then, the meeting began. It was resolved that: (1) The memorial service would not be held on December 29th and would be postponed until the next month, with a date to be determined among the three Saturdays. The venue would be contacted immediately. (2) To raise funds for the memorial service, letters would first be sent to various agencies and organizations inviting them to participate, with donations to be made by each agency and organization. Any shortfall would be raised by the preparatory committee members themselves, but limited to 10 yuan. (3) The budget for the assembly would be determined after the funds had been raised, with economy as the guiding principle. (4) The layout of the venue, memorial service program, etc., would be decided separately. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

### Vietnam Government Requisitioning Vehicles

The Shanghai-Kunming joint transportation operated by the local Sino-French Express Company used to transit through Saigon, Annam. Due to the recent expansion of its business, a new route was opened via Tourane, and an office was set up to accept passengers and goods in Shanghai, which would then be transported to Kunming via Tourane. However, the company recently received a telegram from Saigon stating that all transportation vehicles in Tourane had been requisitioned by the Vietnamese government and that no passenger vehicles could pass through. Therefore, this newly opened route cannot be opened in the near future. All passengers and goods transported from Shanghai to Kunming can only transit through Saigon, so passenger and cargo bookings for the French mail ship *Dumont d'Urville*, which is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 15th of this month, have become even more crowded.

### Chairperson of the Professional Women's Club, Mao Liying, Shot Yesterday; Shot by Assailant on Nanjing Road Near Sichuan Road Last Night; Three Bullets Hit; One in the Abdomen, Condition Critical

Near No. 120 Alley near the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, at around 7:00 PM yesterday, a woman was seen walking out of the alley. The woman was wearing leather shoes and fashionable clothes. As she walked out of the alley and prepared to walk west, a young man in a suit suddenly jumped out of hiding, quickly caught up with her, and walked ahead of her. Unexpectedly, after walking only a few steps, the young man suddenly turned around,

Revealing a Fierce Expression,

Blocking her path. The woman was caught off guard and screamed in alarm. At that moment, the young man took out a pistol from his coat and fired three shots at her, then fled. Nearby police officers heard the alarm and reported it to the police station, which dispatched detectives to search for him. However, the young assailant was already gone. Detective No. 12 rushed the wounded woman to Renji Hospital for treatment. After examination by the hospital's doctor, it was discovered that a bullet had struck the woman's abdomen, but had not passed through. One bullet had struck her leg, and another her foot. Due to significant blood loss, her

Condition is Extremely Critical.

As for her name, it is said to be Mao Liying, age 28, from Ningbo. She currently resides in the Qixiu Girls' School on Avenue Joffre and serves as the chairperson of the Professional Women's Club in the city. The motives behind the attack are difficult to speculate. The police are taking this matter very seriously and are actively investigating. According to an investigation conducted by this newspaper's reporter after the incident, it was learned that the victim had previously worked at the Customs and taught at a school. Because she is still unmarried and frugal, her

Personal Life

Is Quite Comfortable. She usually does not frequent social events, but is committed to promoting women's careers. The charity sale recently held by the Professional Women's Club was promoted by Mao and others. Unfortunately, it was disrupted by villains at the time, but with the help of the police, it was finally completed. Later, a certain publication once falsely accused her of being a communist, but Mao ignored it. She usually does not participate in political activities. This unfortunate incident is very puzzling.

### Wave of Strikes in Northern District Factories

The wave of strikes by workers in factories in the area north of Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession, demanding pay raises, is raging. The Xiangmao Soap Factory, located at No. 2310 Yangshupu Road, began its strike on the 11th, which has not yet been resolved. Yesterday, four more factories also experienced strike waves: the Mifeng Woolen Mill (British) at No. 400 Poyang Road, the China Paper Products Company (American) at No. 273 Haizhou Road, and the "Chinese Workers Welfare Association" of Yangshupu. Their activities have intensified in recent days.

According to the *North-China Daily News*, 700 Chinese employees of the British-owned China Soap Company's factory on Yangshupu Road went on strike due to the rising prices in the city and demands for increased wages. They did not enter the factory for work yesterday (the 11th) morning at 7:00 AM, causing the factory to be closed all day yesterday.

### Former Polish Consul General to China Killed in Bombing; Dr. Kretzschmar Injured During Siege of Warsaw

According to the English-language *China Press*, Dr. Kretzschmar, who lived in China for 15 years, served as a counselor at the Polish Embassy and the Polish Consul General, died in Warsaw during the siege of the city. The city has not yet received definite details of his death, but one report said that Dr. Kretzschmar was injured and died when a shell exploded. The fate of his wife and daughter is unknown, but it is said that they left Warsaw before the outbreak of war. Dr. Kretzschmar was well-known in Shanghai. In addition to his regular duties, he also taught law at Aurora University and handled consular affairs very competently, which was highly regarded by the foreign community. In his youth, Dr. Kretzschmar studied at the University of Paris and the University of Fribourg. After entering the School of Oriental Languages, he became fluent in both Chinese and Japanese. He was recalled from Shanghai to Poland on November 2, 1938.

All those in charge, with the spirit of Christ, endured hardship and tirelessly canvassed for donations.

### Car on Hart Road Refuses Arrest and Flees Last Night; Detectives Ordered to Stop for Search; Occupants Open Fire and Speed Away; Stray Bullet from Five Shots Injures Passerby

Before 7:00 PM yesterday evening, the Jing'an Temple Police Station in charge of Hart Road near Edinburgh Road dispatched patrol detectives to conduct inspections in the nearby area. At around 7:15 PM, patrol detectives noticed a large black sedan speeding eastward. The detectives signaled for it to stop for a search. Unexpectedly, the driver of the car, upon seeing the detectives' signals, immediately turned off all the car's headlights, not only failing to slow down but also doubling its speed, rushing past the detectives' post. The occupants of the car then fired five shots at the detectives from the car. Fortunately, the detectives were scattered in different positions, so they were not hit. They also drew their guns and fired back at the car, but because the car was traveling so fast, they were unable to catch up with it and it escaped. They reported the details to the police station for investigation. At the time, a fishmonger from Shaoxing named Jin Yongquan, age 60, happened to be passing by and was injured in the leg by a stray bullet fired by the occupants of the car. He has been taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment by police car. The whereabouts of the car and its owner are currently under close investigation.

### Woman Carrying Child Killed by Car; Child Fortunately Unharmed

Yuan Huoying from Ningbo, who worked as a broker for the Japanese hardware trading company Longfu Hardware and Machinery at Room 304, No. 86 Guangdong Road, had a good reputation on weekdays. However, from June to July of this year, he went to various gambling dens in Shanghai West and gambled wildly, accumulating heavy debts. He then embezzled 13,380 yuan in payment for goods ordered by four Chinese firms, Huiyuanxiang, Yukang, Tongren, and Yuanchang, and secretly fled. The company's manager, Hiramoto Fukukatsu, reported this to the General Police Station, which issued a warrant for his arrest with a reward. Yuan suddenly surrendered to the police station a few days ago. After investigation by Chinese Detective Kang Zengxiang, he was detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, prosecuted him for occupational embezzlement under criminal law, while the plaintiff indicated that a settlement had been reached and requested leniency. Yuan also pleaded guilty and requested that he be allowed to start anew. Judge Xiao then sentenced Yuan to imprisonment for _ years, with a three-year suspended sentence.

### Swindle for Two Shi of Rice; Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment

Zhao Weizhen from Ningbo, 29 years old, previously an insurance agent, residing at No. 14, Xinyifang, Lane 614, Baishi Road in the Concession, swindled Liu Guang, the owner of the Xinfuzhou Restaurant at No. 618 Lane, out of one dan of top-quality white rice each time on two occasions in the afternoon of the 7th of this month, with each dan priced at 36 yuan. He instructed that the rice be delivered and he would pay. Liu believed him and sent an apprentice to deliver the rice. After Zhao received the rice, he promised to pay the next day. When the next day arrived, Zhao could not be found. Zhao only returned home the day before yesterday, and Liu learned of this and demanded payment for the rice. Zhao prevaricated, and Liu reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Zhao. It was discovered that he had committed a similar fraud before and had been prosecuted. He was taken into custody for investigation. Yesterday afternoon, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District. The police station's lawyer, Yuan Jiahong, stated the facts of the case and prosecuted him for fraud. The plaintiff, Liu Guang, also recounted the details of being swindled. When Zhao was questioned, he denied swindling the rice and claimed that the plaintiff had entrusted him to sell it on his behalf. All the white rice had been resold to a friend on Mei Bai Ke Road, but the money for the rice had not yet been collected. Judge Wu Kechou sentenced Zhao Weizhen to six months imprisonment for continuous fraudulent offenses to serve as a warning. He will be detained in the detention center during the appeal period.

### Intense Gunfire on Avenue Edward VII: Bandit Captured After Being Shot; Escaped from Robbery at a Restaurant on North Honan Road; Police Shot One Bandit Eleven Times; Bystander Killed by Bullet Piercing Chest

Yesterday around 6:15 PM, at a certain restaurant located at No. 106 North Honan Road, just as diners were bustling about, two bandits suddenly barged in to commit robbery. One of the bandits, dressed in a blue cloth jacket and black mandarin jacket, wearing black leather shoes, appeared calm and collected, much like a diner. Therefore, bystanders were not on guard. By the time the two bandits stepped inside the cashier's counter and

produced guns to threaten,

it was too late to escape. They were robbed of over thirty yuan in cash and fled towards Avenue Edward VII on Chekiang Road. An employee of the restaurant, unwilling to let them get away, quickly followed closely behind. Upon reaching the intersection of Avenue Edward VII, the employee ran towards traffic police post No. 2359 and reported the crime. Upon hearing the alarm, the officer immediately drew his gun and opened fire on the bandits. Simultaneously, French Concession police officers also

assisted in the encirclement.

Hearing the gunshots, the bandits fled west along Avenue Edward VII, also firing back to resist arrest. They fought and ran, attempting to turn into Rue de la Soeur. However, the police bullets came in a dense barrage. Apart from one bandit who escaped, the bandit dressed in the blue jacket was shot eleven times at the entrance of Rue de la Soeur and collapsed there, captured on the spot. The Public Concession immediately dispatched a vehicle to transport the wounded bandit to the hospital of the Municipal Council for treatment. Meanwhile, they

pursued the accomplice

for further investigation. All seized weapons were also taken to the police station for safekeeping. However, during the fierce battle between the police and the bandits, a passerby named Yin Weijun, having just left a friend's residence at No. 412 Great Shanghai Hotel, happened to be passing through the area and was unable to evade. A stray bullet pierced his heart, killing him at the entrance of Rue de la Soeur. His body has been sent to the coroner's office, and the deceased's family is being sought for identification and funeral arrangements.

### Truck Kills Pedestrian

Tan Fugen, a local driver for the Xiesheng Transportation Company, residing at No. 12 Youfu Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, was driving a cargo truck, license number F-1213, on Rue Lupan in the French Concession on the morning of the 29th of last month at 8:00 AM, heading south. In front of house number 82, he struck and ran over Yu Yutang, an elderly man from Ningbo in his sixties who was calling out to sell wood shavings. Yu suffered a crushed right foot and died despite medical treatment. The police detained Tan and handed him over to the Second Special Court for interrogation and further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Miao Qingbang continued the hearing at the First Criminal Court. The police prosecutor stated that the investigation was not yet complete and requested a two-week adjournment for further investigation before proceeding with the trial. The court verified the statement and adjourned the hearing to the 21st without questioning, ordering the defendant to be remanded in custody.

### Prank by Patrons: Cigarette Butts Hidden in Bedding

Last night, three patrons visited Han Zhuang at No. 6 Guian Lane, Rue Grolik in the French Concession. For some unknown reason, they suddenly had an argument with the prostitutes and left in displeasure. Before leaving, the three patrons hid their cigarette butts in the bedding on the bed. After the customers left, the maid cleaned the room and discovered smoke coming from the bed. The mistress of Han Zhuang immediately chased after them and caught one of them near Avenue Joffre, handing him over to the police station on Rue Koukuei. After the police chief inquired about the situation, he sent a detective to retrieve the burned bedding from Han Zhuang for further verification.

### Accountant of International Hotel Arrested for Embezzling Large Sum of Money; Falsified Figures and Embezzled Over 40,000 Yuan; Squandered Funds with Bad Friends in Gambling Dens

Zhang Zhifei, a 22-year-old from Songjiang, residing at No. 1 Avenue Foch, joined the accounting department of the International Hotel on Bubbling Well Road four years ago, earning a monthly salary of 65 yuan. He was usually diligent in his work and was deeply trusted by the accounting director, Fang Yinting. However, recently, Zhang

suddenly changed his behavior.

He was listless during the day and often appeared drowsy. After detailed investigation by Fang, it was discovered that Zhang had embezzled as much as 43,000 yuan. Fang then reported to the Sinza Police Station, who dispatched Chinese detective Chen Baozhong and Western detective Batlai to the International Hotel to arrest Zhang Zhifei and detain him at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police prosecutor, Jiang Baolian, charged him with embezzlement and presented the case, stating that the International Hotel had dealings with the Four Banks Joint Savings Society downstairs, and that all

deposit procedures

had been handled by the defendant for several years. However, recently, the defendant had become involved with bad companions and indulged in gambling dens in Western Shanghai, resulting in substantial losses and leading to this large-scale embezzlement. The method of embezzlement involved the defendant receiving, for example, 3,671.14 yuan to deposit, but only depositing 671.14 yuan, pocketing the remaining 3,000 yuan. After the bank stamped the deposit book, the defendant would privately add the word "three thousand".

This behavior

continued from August 9th of this year until the 5th of this month, with successive embezzlements. Although the bank provided statements at the end of the month, these were also handled and altered by the defendant, so the scheme had not been discovered for several months. With this large sum of money, the defendant, in addition to renting room No. 620 at the Yangtze Hotel, would go to gambling dens such as the Hollywood and Asia Clubs in Western Shanghai every night, wagering thousands of yuan without hesitation, staying up all night, which resulted in a dazed state during the day. The

bank statement

for November was received the day before yesterday, and the defendant, in a moment of carelessness, failed to alter the total amount, leading to the discovery. A pass for the Asia Club and 87 yuan in cash were presented as evidence. When questioned, the defendant confessed to the embezzlement, claiming that it was due to a moment of confusion and associating with bad friends, resulting in the total loss of the money. Judge Xiao ordered Zhang to be remanded in custody for seven days pending further investigation.

### Social Miscellany

Car Fire: Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, at the intersection of Avenue Messimy and Avenue Foch in the French Concession, a Westerner was driving his own car when the engine suddenly caught fire. Flames erupted, and thick smoke filled the air. The fire was eventually extinguished after the fire brigade arrived.

Korean Trafficking Drugs: Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, two Koreans at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Avenue Montigny refused to be searched by Russian officers patrolling for the French Police. They were taken to the police station. It is said that one of them was found to be carrying drugs.

Thief Caught: Yesterday morning around 2:00 AM, a thief broke into a certain pharmacy at No. 231 Hongqiao Road, Xujiahui in the French Concession by digging a hole in the back wall, intending to commit theft. An employee, Mr. Jia, noticed and gave chase, shouting "robber!". A detective of the French police happened to be patrolling nearby and rushed to the scene upon hearing the shouts, immediately opening fire and pursuing the thief. Three shots were fired, one of which struck the thief's left foot, the bullet passing through. He fell to the ground in pain and was captured. He identified himself as Xu Asi, from Jiangbei, 30 years old, and confessed to the attempted theft.

Stray Bullet Injures Person: Fan Jichang, a 19-year-old from Chongming, was walking along Avenue Haig in Western Shanghai yesterday afternoon when a stray bullet suddenly struck his left leg, causing him to fall to the ground injured. He was taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory issued the following weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: North China and the Yellow Sea will be clear and cold, with light and variable winds. The Yangtze River basin and this area will change from overcast to cloudy, with light northerly to easterly winds. The East China Sea will be overcast, with normal winter monsoon winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 49.5 degrees, and the lowest was 32.7 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 57.7 degrees, and the lowest was 48.6 degrees.

### Overview of This Year's Unified University Entrance Examination (3) - Overview by Section Chief Huang Longxian of the Ministry of Education

(5) Scoring Standards

Grading and scoring are just as important as setting the questions in assessing exam performance. The Unified Entrance Examination Committee is not directly responsible for the grading and scoring; rather, it is handled by each admission district. However, the Unified Entrance Examination Committee first establishes grading and scoring standards to ensure a relatively consistent approach across all districts. Due to the large number of districts, vast geographical area, numerous exam papers, and difficult transportation, this approach is necessary. This year, there were a total of 20,006 examinees. Each examinee had at least seven exam papers, resulting in a total of over 140,000 exam papers. For distant examination districts such as Shanghai and Yanping, the transportation time would be at least one month. If each grader could review a maximum of 100 exam papers per day, it would take 140 people ten days to review 140,000 exam papers. Centralized grading is not feasible due to transportation, time, and personnel constraints. Therefore, regional grading is necessary. As the examination method is not new, establishing highly objective standards for grading and scoring is difficult. Thus, only a few relatively objective principles were established: (1) In addition to setting the questions, the question-setting committee must also establish a grading standard for each question, outlining the possible scenarios for each question, such as fully correct, partially correct, incorrect, or excellent, good, average, below average, and poor, and specifying the corresponding score for each category. The total score is based on 100 points. (2) The exam questions for each subject must be graded question by question by the grading committee, in accordance with the scoring standards outlined in the previous section. (3) Separate standards are established for physical education practical tests. Although these three regulations seem simple, they cover the important principles. In addition, regional grading is not a problem in examination districts with national universities. In areas without national universities, examination districts must be established for practical reasons, such as Lanzhou, Enshi, Taihe, Yongkang, Qujiang, and Zhenping, with Nanzheng, Chongqing, Guilin, and the Zhejiang University branch campus serving as their grading districts. This eliminates any potential difficulties.

(6) Regulations for Recommendation and Preferential Treatment

In addition to examination-based admission, the Unified Entrance Examination also adopts a recommendation system. I explained the reasons for this in the previous section. Last year, students recommended for admission without examination were limited to the top 15% of high school graduation exam passers. Graduates of national high schools were limited to those with "A" grades (overall average score of 80 or above). If the number of students with "A" grades exceeded 15% of the high school graduates in that school, the top 15% of students with the highest scores would be recommended. The regulations are stricter this year: those in the top 10% of high school graduation exams are eligible, a decrease of 5% from last year. The recommendation of outstanding national high school graduates for admission without examination has been completely abolished. However, this year, in addition to provinces with graduation exams being able to recommend students for admission without examination according to regulations, preparatory classes and provinces in occupied areas can also recommend students. Preparatory classes can recommend the top 25% of students with the best grades. Provinces in occupied areas can recommend 20% of their high school graduates this year. The original purpose of establishing preparatory classes was to provide students who did not participate in or were not admitted to the Unified Entrance Examination last year with the opportunity for preparatory studies. They are a type of preparatory school between high school and university, similar to the university preparatory courses of the past, but not actually university preparatory courses, because university preparatory courses allow students to enter university without further examination. Students from preparatory classes must still pass an entrance examination to enter university. Students completing the preparatory class program do not have special qualifications, but they have one year more training than high school graduates, so a system of recommendation for admission without examination is necessary. Due to the special circumstances in occupied areas and the difficulty of taking the examination, a system of recommendation is also necessary and essential. In addition, there are two types of preferential treatment this year: one for students from Mongolia and Tibet, and one for overseas Chinese students. Mongolia and Tibet are located in border areas, and the academic level of students there is naturally not comparable to students from the interior. Overseas Chinese students receive education abroad that differs from that of the motherland. Preferential treatment and lenient admission must be adopted for these students in examinations. This is already mandated by law.

(7) Restrictions on Equivalent Educational Qualifications

The admission of students with equivalent educational qualifications by universities is a new regulation that started last year. Equivalent educational qualification naturally means having academic ability equivalent to that of a high school graduate. In other words, it means that although one has not graduated from high school, their academic ability is equal to that of a high school graduate. It is not a matter of qualifications, but of level. Before the promulgation of the University Organization Law, taking the university entrance examination with equivalent educational qualifications was permitted by law. However, the examination methods were not strict enough, leading to abuse. Therefore, this regulation was abolished, and examinations relied solely on qualifications. Many talented students were inevitably buried due to this restriction. Therefore, the Unified Entrance Examination last year granted special permission for those with equivalent educational qualifications to register for the examination, but stipulated that the number of admitted students could not exceed 10% of the total number of admitted students. The regulations are even stricter this year: students with equivalent educational qualifications must submit a detailed resume when registering for the examination, and the number of admitted students cannot exceed 10% of the total number of admitted students. Furthermore, admission is limited to the top half of the total ranking of admitted students in each district. Although the admission percentage remains the same at 10%, the method is much stricter.

In addition to the seven points mentioned above, there are two more important matters: the admission standards and the allocation method. These two are the backbone of the Unified Entrance Examination and will be discussed in separate sections later. To summarize, the differences between this year's Unified Entrance Examination and last year's are: (1) There are more examination districts and locations this year, and the distribution is more widespread. (2) More schools are participating in the examination, including the various institutions in Shanghai. (3) The exam questions are unified. (4) The proportion of recommendations is smaller. (5) The limit on equivalent educational qualifications is stricter. (6) Students from Mongolia and Tibet and overseas Chinese students will be admitted leniently. (7) There are more applicants, and the percentage of admissions is smaller. (8) Allocation considers both preferences and performance, as well as region, adopting the established methods of last year. The Unified Entrance Examination is an innovation, and we must thank the efforts of last year's organizers for providing such a well-established precedent to follow.

### Ministry of Education Has Not Recently Sent Personnel to Shanghai to Inspect Education; Official Statement of Facts

(Chongqing Air Mail) Recently, rumors circulated in Shanghai that the Ministry of Education had sent personnel to inspect education at all levels of schools and social education, and to complete and submit survey forms, as well as register unemployed teachers and staff. The Ministry of Education has denied all of these claims. According to an official, the Ministry of Education has assigned personnel to be fully responsible for educational affairs in Shanghai, maintaining regular contact with the heads of various schools. Any routine inspections by Ministry personnel are conducted with proper credentials and accompanied by official notification for the completion of forms. There has been absolutely no recent dispatch of additional personnel to conduct inspections, order the completion of survey forms, or register unemployed teachers and staff. The recent rumors circulating in Shanghai appear to be deliberate attempts to sow confusion.

### Grain Prices: Japanese Side Reportedly Willing to Cooperatively Eliminate Rice Panic with Concession Authorities; If Supply Sources Are Truly Unimpeded... Rice Prices Can Drop; Hoping... Price Limits Are Strictly Enforced... Differentiated According to Grade

Yesterday, although only a dozen or so trucks arrived from various domestic suppliers, the market, since the implementation of price controls, should be difficult to manipulate on the whole. At the opening of the morning market, both buyers and sellers were eager to sell, and hoarders and speculators continued to release their previously hoarded goods. The market was flooded with returned goods, and transactions were scarce, causing prices to fall steadily. Approaching midday, regardless of whether it was early rice or glutinous rice, prices fell sharply, with losses exceeding one yuan. Until almost noon, after the various goods had been thoroughly discounted, local shops took the opportunity to inquire, and the situation gradually became more active, with prices rising step by step. However, the result was that the prices in the morning market had already been thoroughly discounted, and although there was a slight rebound, they were still down by three or four cents to five or six cents compared to the previous market. The recent surge in rice prices in Shanghai is due to unscrupulous collusion and mutual exploitation. Rice prices in the suburbs of Shanghai are generally no more than twenty-two or twenty-three yuan (in places like North Bridge, Caohejing, etc.). Therefore, some people use bicycles to transport rice, carrying four or five pecks each time, and making two or three trips back and forth, with profits exceeding ten yuan. This has aroused the Japanese side's concern, resulting in the detention of more than four hundred of these bicycles the day before yesterday (see yesterday's newspaper). It is also heard that a large number of rice boats have been detained in Minhang, with masts like a forest, unable to proceed. If this rice can still supply the Shanghai market, it will be difficult for manipulators, even with strong backing. Now it is heard that a Japanese spokesperson has expressed a willingness to do their best to assist the two concession authorities in resolving the speculation in rice and other grains, and has also stated that the Japanese army, in order to show its sincerity in cooperation, will transport a large quantity of rice to Shanghai in the coming days to balance the uneven market prices until the rice panic in this port is completely resolved. This is what is reported in the French-language Japanese newspaper. If this is the case, the source of rice and other grains in Shanghai should not be hindered, and there is great hope for a drop in rice prices. However, it is essential to have strict management of the market to prevent unscrupulous elements from causing trouble. There are rumors in the market that a small number of unscrupulous merchants are selling rice at the controlled price while demanding as much as fifty-four yuan for better-grade rice. It should be known that the controlled price refers to the top-grade rice. Medium-grade rice should be priced differently, but differentiated pricing depends on the efforts of those enforcing the regulations and the determination of the industry to rectify itself. This newspaper already discussed this in yesterday's editorial.

During the strict enforcement of price limits, some hoarders sought to sell off their stock of early Indica rice in the morning, and the supply from the Yangtze River has not been interrupted, so the market sentiment has gradually stabilized. In the morning market, prices once fell by one and a half yuan, but later, shops took advantage of the small drop to absorb the supply, and the market rebounded. In the end, prices were down by about one yuan. Early Indica rice was sold at thirty-seven yuan, with second-grade rice at thirty-six yuan, totaling 2,000 bags.

In addition to a new shipment of foreign rice, there are more than 40,000 bags that are expected to arrive today, and both firms and merchants are releasing their stock. The morning market saw a sharp drop of more than one and a half yuan, but prices rebounded slightly after small-scale sales. Statistics show that 3,000 bags of spot goods were sold, with Saigon rice priced at thirty-seven and a half yuan, with second-grade rice at thirty-six yuan, and broken rice at thirty-three yuan. Returned goods from the road amounted to 400 to 500 tons, with original packages initially opening at forty-four yuan, then rebounding to forty-four and a half yuan. Forward orders were not placed. According to a telegram from foreign merchants, even second-grade rice would cost forty-four to forty-five yuan.

### Manipulating Food Prices: Focus on Flour

Since rice prices were controlled, hoarders temporarily had no opportunity to exploit rice, and have shifted their manipulation to flour, which has the same value as rice. This has been the case for several days. Yesterday, factory prices continued to increase, with second-grade flour changing to eight yuan and five cents, an increase of one cent from before. Although various factories are increasing the price to customers by three or four cents, they are still reluctant to sell, so the price of returned goods in the market is becoming increasingly high. Green Cannon and Dongfeng flour have already risen to eight yuan and nine cents and nine yuan, respectively. However, the situation eased somewhat in the afternoon, as the concession authorities have been strictly cracking down on rice hoarding, causing speculators to be wary. It is heard that Japanese factories are holding back their newly hoarded flour to observe the market. Phoenix brand flour for December has rebounded to eight yuan, one cent, seven or eight cents, and for January, it has also decreased slightly to eight yuan, five cents, six or seven cents.

Wheat prices are rising even more sharply, as the source of supply is frequently blocked, and those holding goods are deliberately hoarding them for higher prices. Factories and hoarders are eager to purchase, making the market even more brisk. Fufeng factory purchased 2,000 bags of wheat from Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuhu, reaching a new high price of fourteen yuan and two cents. Market transactions also amounted to more than twenty truckloads. Suzhou wheat was priced at fourteen yuan and seven cents, Danyang wheat at fourteen yuan, and Changzhou wheat at thirteen yuan and nine cents.

### Finance: Ministry of Finance Advises Against Further Trading; Gold Market Has Many Selling Off at Inflated Prices; However, Hong Kong Banks Are Still Buying

The cash gold "烚赤" grey market trended weaker yesterday. This was because foreign exchange rates were easing, and reports said that the Ministry of Finance specially telegraphed the four major banks and the municipal chamber of commerce, instructing them to immediately forward the advice to jewelers in Shanghai not to continue private buying and selling. Therefore, some investors who had bet on rising prices, in light of such an environment, temporarily had the idea of selling off. As a result, there were quite a few chips in the market. Fortunately, the Hong Kong banks did not change their consistent style of entering the market to buy, and the major bullish investors still had good intentions, taking the opportunity to buy more when prices were low. Therefore, the result was only a drop of twenty-four yuan. The morning opening price fell by thirty-four yuan to four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan due to the influence of the relatively weak foreign exchange market. Subsequently, the Hong Kong banks and a certain money exchange business successively bought aggressively, once reaching four thousand one hundred and seventy-five yuan. At noon, the foreign exchange market eased again, and the Hong Kong banks had also stopped buying, so the noon closing price was only four thousand one hundred and fifty-eight yuan. The afternoon situation was flat, and the closing price was four thousand one hundred and sixty yuan. There were few large transactions throughout the day, but the volume was still more than 2,000 taels. Jewelers reduced the price of gold jewelry by five yuan, and customs gold, etc., remained unchanged.

"烚赤" dropped twenty-four yuan

In the morning, the initial opening price for each "bar" (ten taels) fell by thirty-four yuan because the foreign exchange market eased after opening. Jewelers and money exchange businesses competed to press down prices to sell, extending to the 9:35 am opening of the "烚赤" market, dropping by thirty-four yuan. A money exchange sold one tael to a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. Subsequently, under selling pressure, it dropped another ten yuan, reaching a low of four thousand one hundred and forty yuan. Some gold shops and securities businesses absorbed some of this. Later, as foreign exchange stopped easing and recovered slightly, sellers gradually decreased, and prices gradually rose back to four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. At this time, Hong Kong banks suddenly began to buy, entrusting a jeweler and a gold shop to buy on their behalf, so the price rose by another ten yuan. During this period, some gold shops and securities businesses took the opportunity to sell off a lot of their holdings, realizing profits. Thereafter, as foreign exchange recovered slightly, and a certain money exchange had a strong appetite for buying, the price rose another ten yuan. A securities business sold twenty taels to a jeweler for four thousand one hundred and seventy-five yuan. Then, as the foreign exchange market hardened, buyers gradually decreased, and jewelers and money exchange businesses frequently sold, dropping back to four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. At noon, a gold shop came back to buy, raising the price by five yuan. A gold shop bought twenty taels from a money exchange for four thousand one hundred and sixty yuan. Subsequently, a jeweler sold twenty taels to a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and fifty-eight yuan, which was the noon closing price. The initial opening price in the afternoon fell by eight yuan because the foreign exchange market was hardening. A cash gold shop sold ten taels to a money exchange for four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. Later, Hong Kong banks bought a hundred and several tens of taels, pulling the price up by fourteen yuan. A money exchange bought ten taels from a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and sixty-four yuan. After that, Hong Kong banks stopped their activity, and jewelers still had a selling appetite, dropping back to four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. Later, a gold shop bought several tens of taels, immediately bringing the price back up by ten yuan. A gold shop bought twenty taels from a money exchange for four thousand one hundred and sixty yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, the price dropped twenty-four yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by only thirty-five yuan throughout the day. Cash gold shops sold their own brand of gold at a price a few yuan higher than the "烚赤" price, but the purchase price had to be reduced by twenty yuan. The current price of standard gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed price, with few transactions.

The price of jewelry fell by five yuan

The initial selling price of gold jewelry in jewelry stores was still four hundred and twenty-five yuan for Da Tong Heng. The price was reduced by five yuan at 9:38 am, and there were no changes after that. In the end, Da Tong Heng changed the price to four hundred and twenty yuan. The price of new shops was the same as the above price, with the purchase price reduced by fifteen yuan or so.

### Foreign Exchange Market: Few Buyers

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no changes in the listed prices of HSBC. The trend in the gray market for British and American exchange rates was easing, but it was still able to hold steady, because a certain HSBC bank and others had bought large amounts. As a result, the exchange rates only eased by .0625 and .15625. In the morning, the sharp rise of one cent in the exchange rate between the US and British currencies caused the market opening to indicate a flat pound and an easing dollar. Subsequently, as Hong Kong brokers first dumped stock, and then the Chinese cotton yarn and flower traders sold off their holdings, the market weakened at 9:20, already showing a loose price of 4 辦士 5 625 and 7 yuan 50 cents. Some foreign banks such as HSBC absorbed a lot of the holdings. Before long, importers saw an opportunity and began to buy, so the situation recovered slightly, once having shouted out prices of 4 辦士 5 1625 and 7 yuan 40625, but few transactions at the higher prices were heard. Then, as buyers disappeared and foreign banks had a willingness to supply, it was again unable to hold and began to weaken again. By the noon close, the exchange rates were 4 辦士 5 46875 and 7 yuan 46875. In the afternoon, the market situation continued to be slightly tighter in silence, as foreign banks such as Hua Bi and Hong Kong Telegraph had stock to sell. As a result, the market closed at 4 辦士 5 625 and 7 yuan 50 cents. As for futures trading, although there were still people opening positions, the underlying trend was still the same as the spot market.

HSBC's settlements turned slightly steadier

In the morning, the prices for both near-term and far-term London big bars were up 1.875. The price of silver in New York remained flat. The price of raw gold in London was unchanged. The exchange rates between British currency and American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The American currency was up two cents against the British currency, unchanged against the Shanghai currency, and up 1.75 cents against the French currency. The listed prices for various currencies at the Central Bank remained the same. The opening selling prices for spot currencies at banks in the morning were 4 辦士半 for British currency and 7 yuan 375 for American currency, with British currency flat and American currency down .03125 compared to the previous close, due to the increase in exchange rates. After the opening, Hong Kong Telegraph first dumped stock, and at the same time, Chinese cotton yarn and flower traders also came to compete to sell, so the market immediately showed easing. Hong Kong Telegraph and Chinese traders sold spot British currency at 4 辦士 5 3125 and 5625 and spot American currency at 7 yuan 4375 to a certain bank and HSBC, and the American currency for this month at 7 yuan 50 cents. The HSBC listing revealed no changes. The silver equalization tax revealed a increase of one cent. After that, the selling pressure subsided, so the situation stabilized. Before long, importers suddenly came to buy, causing the market situation to recover slightly. Foreign firms settled spot British currency at 4 辦士 5 3225 and spot American currency at 7 yuan 4375. Afterwards, the prices were shouted down to 4 辦士 5 1625 and 7 yuan 40625, but no transactions were heard. Then, as foreign banks' willingness to sell increased, and the buyers had disappeared, the situation again became tighter. An American bank dumped the American currency for this month at 7 yuan 50 cents to HSBC. Until the afternoon, the banks' selling prices for spot currencies were 4 辦士 5 46875 for British currency and 7 yuan 46875 for American currency, with British currency down .046875 and American currency up .09375 compared to the morning opening prices.

British and American closing prices continued to show easing

Trading in the later market was still very scarce, but the situation continued to show a slight easing. A certain Chinese bank sold American currency notes at 7 yuan 50 cents to a money exchange, and then Hua Bi also sold the American currency for this month at 7 yuan 50 cents to the same industry. At the same time, it was heard that Hong Kong Telegraph also sold spot American currency at 7 yuan 50 cents to foreign banks. There was very little trading in British currency. Afterwards, the situation became even more silent. Until the evening close, the banks' selling prices for spot currencies were 4 辦士 5 625 for British currency and 7 yuan 50 cents for American currency. The prices for the current month were 4 辦士 5 46875 for British currency and 7 yuan 46875 for American currency, and the prices for January were 4 辦士 5 3125 for British currency and 7 yuan 375 for American currency.

Yesterday, the supply of British and American gold coins and gold notes was relatively abundant, and the market was weak. The evening market price of American gold notes fell to 13 yuan 34 cents. The supply of Hong Kong notes and French francs was abundant, and market prices fell. There was little demand for new Dutch notes, and the market price was weak. The price of Canadian notes was also low. There was a strong demand for Japanese gold notes, and the market price was strong. The evening market price was 1 yuan 25 cents. The price of Korean notes was also strong, and the evening market price was 1 yuan 13 cents 5 li.

The rate continued to decline slightly in the afternoon to 45 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan 50 cents from the previous day. The call loan rate of the Money Industry Association was still 15 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities: Large Numbers of Rubber Shares Taken for Profits; Domestic Debt Still Stagnant

The situation in the gray market for securities remained quiet and wait-and-see yesterday. Transactions among the various groups were even scarcer. However, the underlying environment has changed significantly, and although there may be a day of breakout, the trend of government bonds yesterday did not break free from the inherent pattern of recent days. Market prices still rose and fell within a range of 5 to 10 cents, and the stagnation remained unchanged. Therefore, the result was still a mix of highs and lows, ranging from 5 to 20 cents, with a total turnover of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. A brief summary is provided below.

In stock trading, 50 shares of the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange were traded at a price of 10 yuan. The Public Industry Association reported that stock trading, with a few exceptions, was almost entirely dominated by rubber shares. The opening market situation was extremely enthusiastic, and large numbers of investors immediately took profits, encountering a setback in the upward trend. Afterwards, the trend became firmer again, with buyers crowding at prices slightly lower than the highest price of the day. The most popular shares were various low-priced shares, such as Chen's, Karen Dan, Di Bang, and Li Pai. The highest-priced shares were Langezhi shares. Interest in industrial shares remained minimal. Only International Trust, Shanghai Silver Company, Ruirong, and Xiangtai Lumber were relatively active. Xiangtai Lumber shares have now risen to 34 yuan.

London, November 11th - Today, the listed prices of stocks of various Far East companies of British merchants were generally stable. Only the unrecorded shares of the Kaiping Coal Mine continued to fall by 6 pence, to a price of 17 shillings.

London, November 11th - The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt fell in four categories today. The Anglo-French loan (issued in British currency) fell sharply by £5, to a price of £45. The Rehabilitation Loan (issued in British currency) fell by £3, to a price of £35. The Crisp Loan and the Jinghu Railway each fell by £2, with the former at £25 and the latter at £18. The rest remained unchanged.

### Cotton Yarn and Cotton: Eager to Sell Off Holdings; Yarn Prices Plunge; 20-Count Yarn Drops Another 10 Yuan

The yarn market continued to be weak and scattered. This was because the inventory of 20-count cotton yarn was too high. After several days of rising prices, those who had profited could earn tens of yuan, and they have already sold off their holdings to realize profits. As a result, the situation eased, and selling pressure became even greater. The market could not hold up and tended to fall. However, in the overseas cotton market, Indian cotton has stabilized, but American cotton is advancing all the way. However, given the former situation, the human spirit could not be aroused. However, the high cost of raw materials will inevitably increase future costs.

At the opening of the spot yarn market in the morning, some scalpers were shouting prices to each other. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 735 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan from the previous day, with 10 bales traded. As soon as this price opened, there were many people seeking to sell, but no one was willing to accept the offer, and the market rapidly declined. Later, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was slightly weaker, and human sentiment became more relaxed. The market fell straight to 718 yuan at the close. Afterwards, there was a slight rebound. It was found that 2,030 bales were traded in half a day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 11 yuan, Double Earth fell by 10 yuan, and Heavenly Maiden fell by 10 yuan. Xinyu Factory opened 600 bales of 20-count Double Earth for this month at 710 yuan, and 600 bales for the next month at 725 yuan. Today, 60 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 30 pieces were shipped to Haikou. The amount of yarn purchased by various groups is listed below:

Same Trade 1,690 bales, Hong Kong 50 bales, Yunnan 20 bales

Inland 200 bales, Jiangxi 60 bales, Total 2,030 bales

### US Cotton Export Subsidies Reduced to 20 Pounds: Shanghai Factory Activity Is Sluggish

Transactions in local cotton were slightly calmer. Factories still showed no activity, and human sentiment was relatively flat. Because yarn prices could not rise actively and the trend was not broad, factories were unwilling to buy raw materials. However, with foreign cotton so expensive, local cotton was still cheaper, so although transactions among the same industry decreased, few people were bearish on the market price. The price of white-wrapped cotton was roughly the same as the previous day. Sudanese cotton, which is the raw material for spinning 32-count yarn, was sold for 226 yuan. The asking price for Brazilian cotton, which is the raw material for spinning 42-count yarn, was 250 yuan in the market. The source of cotton from Northern Jiangsu was quiet again. Only 849 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock, and 3,670 bales arrived from Beisha. Today, 120 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. The current situation of cotton is listed below:

Chongtong 162.00 yuan, 152 bales purchased by the same industry

Tongzhou 167.10 yuan, also 66 bales

Fine velvet in bales 182.00 yuan, also 100 bales

Tongzhou 166.00 yuan, also 532 bales

Also 165.50 yuan, also 231 bales

Also 168.00 yuan, also 222 bales

Hangzhou burlap 155.00 yuan, also 185 bales

Chongtong 162.00 yuan, also 200 bales

Tongzhou 167.10 yuan, also 200 bales

Sudan 226.00 yuan, also 200 pieces

Changyinsha 156.00 yuan, also 100 bales

Fire weed bales 157.50 yuan, also 100 bales

Also white bales 158.50 yuan, also 180 bales

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton in New York was exceptionally strong because overseas cotton merchants were competing to buy. Export subsidies were becoming increasingly depleted. Yesterday, US Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wells also announced a reduction of 20 pounds in export subsidies. The remaining amount that can be subsidized for US cotton exports is now only 20 pounds. It is widely believed that this remaining 20 pounds will also be eliminated in the very near future. According to Agriculture Secretary Wallace, since July 27, cotton sold under the export subsidy program has reached 5.7 million bales. Wallace also predicted that the cotton inventory on August 1, 1940, would be 2 million bales less than the previous year. In the New York market, cotton prices rose another 20 pounds due to competition among buyers. The Indian cotton market was flat. Egyptian cotton rose by more than 100 pounds. Liverpool rose by more than 20 pence.

In Shanghai, the trading of foreign cotton in terms of forward orders was becoming increasingly quiet due to the US government's repeated reductions in export subsidies and the soaring cotton market. All parties were holding a wait-and-see attitude. However, the same industry, because of the goods previously ordered, was earning huge profits and was eager to sell their holdings. Therefore, their selling prices were much cheaper than those of foreign firms. The factory delivery prices converted to US dollars at 7 yuan 4375 for yesterday's cotton market are as follows:

20-count US Metlin 234.95 yuan

20-count also, lower grade 230.50 yuan

32-count also 242.15 yuan

32-count also, lower grade 235.90 yuan

42-count also 245.75 yuan

42-count also, lower grade 227.70 yuan

### Sugar Market: Green and Red Sugar Rise by 1-2 Yuan

The market for domestic green and red sugar was even tighter yesterday. Huanggang green sugar rose nearly 2 yuan again, with several hundred bales traded at 42.5 yuan. Cotton red sugar also rose by about 1 yuan, with over 200 bales offered at 44 to 42.3 yuan. Several hundred bales of Huizhou white sugar were offered at 54 yuan, 400 bales of ordinary Hainan red sugar were offered at 33 yuan, 200 bales of Dongxiang red sugar were offered at 42 yuan, and several hundred bales of Han red sugar were offered at 41 yuan for the high grade and 37 yuan for the second grade. The exchange's listed price for 24 coarse white sugar was not much different. Wooden warehouse goods were 57.5 yuan, up 50 cents. New foreign warehouse goods were 58.5 yuan to 58.3 yuan, and old goods were 58 yuan to 57.5 yuan. Transshipment goods were still 49 yuan.

Dutch red sugar was unchanged, domestic ice sugar was up 50 cents, grade 1 was 67.5 yuan, grade 2 was 67 yuan, and Jingming ice was 69 yuan.

Domestic products from Jiangbei Juegang House have also arrived, with good quality goods selling for 160 yuan to 170 yuan, which is quite brisk.

### Suggestions for Implementing Family Winter Protection

— Xing

The north wind roars, the climate is bitterly cold, and the mercury in the thermometer has retreated to its lowest point. Thick clothes have all been moved out of the wardrobe and put on. The withered leaves hanging on the treetops are also falling one by one with the wind, and everything on earth symbolizes the severity of the season.

Theft and fire are the most rampant during this severe winter season. To avoid these unfortunate events, precise prevention is necessary. Therefore, the author would like to suggest the implementation of this family winter protection movement, so that the residents of each house can raise the spirit of mutual assistance and jointly bear the responsibility for family safety. This will not only avoid all unexpected losses and unfortunate encounters for oneself, but also cultivate good disciplined habits!

### Suggestions for Fire Prevention

In the bedroom: (1) Do not place coal stoves, wind stoves, kerosene stoves, etc. In this severe winter, many people are greedy for warmth and move coal stoves into the bedroom. As a result, unfortunate events of carbon monoxide poisoning and fires have been repeatedly reported in the past. These two unfortunate encounters can lead to the meaningless sacrifice of life. (2) When lying in bed, smoking cigarettes should be absolutely prohibited. If you are momentarily careless and the cigarette butt falls on the quilt, even this spark can become a prairie fire and become uncontrollable. (3) Matches, lit candle stubs, kerosene lamps, etc., should all be placed in fixed and safe places. If there are extremely flammable objects (such as celluloid toys, oiled paper, cotton, etc.), they should be isolated from them. (4) Wastepaper baskets and spittoons should not be placed in the same place. In case a cigarette butt is mistakenly thrown into the wastepaper basket, it can easily cause a fire. (5) Do not place any miscellaneous items at the entrance of the room. In case of a sudden incident, this will not obstruct entry and exit. This point should also be noted.

In the kitchen: (1) Coal balls should be stored in wooden boxes, and firewood should be stacked in a suitable place, and both must be kept away from stoves and oil spills. When not needed, do not place them near the stove. (2) Small pieces of wood and wood shavings for starting fires should be placed in a safe place. (3) Check whether there are any leaks or smoke coming out of the chimney on the stove. Whether there is any ash from the stove left on the ground. Before going to bed at night, carefully and completely extinguish the embers in the stove. (4) Coal stoves must be placed in designated places. Do not place one here and one there, or even one at the door of the room. Thin foreign pine room boards, scorched by coal fire for a long time, are dry and extremely flammable, which is very dangerous. To put it simply, coal stoves or wind stoves should not be placed in any place other than the kitchen. (5) If there is a stove in the room, always check the red coal cinders to prevent them from falling on the floor. Before going to bed, also extinguish the burning coal in the stove. (6) Always pay attention to exposed electrical wires and switches, whether they are damaged, to avoid electric leakage and fire, and the danger of electric shock. (To be continued)

### A Group Snatching Cotton

— Hu Di

At the intersection of Tongfu Road, several cargo trucks loaded with cotton bales stopped at the traffic lights. At this moment, a group of vagrants hiding under an advertising board on the street corner darted out like rabbits. Waiting for the traffic lights to change, they used the most agile movements to snatch the snow-white cotton from behind and beside the trucks. The porters sitting on the cotton bales waved their rattan whips around, but this method of expulsion was ineffective. They all knew how to avoid the direction of the whips. Even if they were unfortunately hit hard, they could win more spoils in that moment of opportunity because they could take advantage of the gap when the porters retracted their whips to grab as much as possible.

Passersby on the street corner were captivated by this scene and stopped to watch. However, when the third cargo truck passed the police post, a cotton-snatching man was pulled down by a porter using a rope tied around his neck, like the "Binding Immortal Rope" in "Investiture of the Gods." The man seemed to have completely lost consciousness and was dragged along as the truck accelerated. This even more exciting scene made the onlookers applaud, and some even surged forward, like Roman kings appreciating the brave warriors in the arena being wounded by cruel weapons.

However, the truck had already stopped ahead. Several porters jumped out of the truck, punched the man a few times, scolded him a few times, and then drove away again. This ending may have disappointed the audience. The defeated warrior, unexpectedly, quickly got up, without touching the skin on his neck torn by the rope, nor wiping the bloodstains on his face. He bent down, only to pick up the cotton that he had lost on the road during the battle. He moved so nimbly, filling his waist pockets before striding back to his position – under the advertising board on the street corner. None of his companions paid attention to whether he was injured or not, only patted him on the shoulder to celebrate his victory. Then, everyone put the cotton in a large paper bag and sat down in a sunny place to rest, looking like they were waiting for their second expedition.

After this scene ended, one of the spectators expressed his opinion, saying, "Why don't the police ask or care?"

Yes, this is robbery! But we still remember the news of people deliberately robbing passers-by of their wallets because they had no way to make a living and were willing to go to jail. This group of homeless vagrants, with ropes tied around their necks, being dragged by cars, and being beaten by porters with fists and feet, did not care, and what they fought for with their lives was only less than half a kilogram of cotton. The law can only "turn a deaf ear" to these people.

However, this is a hidden worry of society, and this abnormally developed city is forcing them to embark on a more dangerous path. Only when people are well-fed and clothed will they know shame. It is useless to shake your head and sigh, especially in an era when even being well-fed and clothed does not guarantee that one knows shame!

Chapter 18: Discussing Economic Prosperity and Reviving Old Markets; Narrating Marriage Seizures and Tracing Back to Old Customs

Now Wu Junsuo knew that Jin Danyun wanted her to go, not just to be a bridesmaid, but perhaps for other reasons. Apart from the Wu sisters and Shao Huihua, who all had families in Shanghai and didn't need to worry about accommodation, the He sisters and Zhu Airen didn't have families in Shanghai and would have to stay in a hotel. The He sisters were originally from a wealthy family and could choose to stay in the largest hotel in Shanghai, but they knew that Zhu Airen was thrifty and didn't like staying in big hotels. Therefore, they discussed choosing a mid-range hotel that was hygienic. They decided to choose a large room and live together. Although Jin Danyun had called Zhu Airen and booked many rooms for them at the Grand Hotel, asking them to stay there as well, they thought it would be less free and preferred to find their own hotel. So, these six people arrived in Shanghai. Zhu Airen rarely came to Shanghai, and she would definitely drive to the train station to pick them up. Unfortunately, she was too busy today, not only having to entertain Chinese relatives and friends but also a group of foreign friends attending the wedding, all of whom she had to entertain herself. Although Mrs. Sulia was taking on the responsibility of hosting, Mrs. Sulia's own daughter was not yet married. Now that she had come to China, she treated Jin Danyun like a Chinese daughter. However, although Mrs. Sulia was a wealthy American, the new couple, Lin Jiancheng and Yu Danyun, both advocated thriftiness and tried to save money wherever possible. Therefore, their new home was just a not-so-spacious house. It was a three-story building, and the house was very modern, located in the western district of Shanghai. The house was built according to Lin Jiancheng's design. There were several houses in this row, each with a different architectural style. In the past, when building houses, foreign-style houses were often referred to as French, German, or Anglo-American. Now, there was no longer the concept of imitating different countries' styles. Architectural engineers designed the plans themselves, as long as they met the conditions of cleanliness, hygiene, comfort, and beauty, regardless of the country's style. Although the house was not large, the courtyard was still spacious. People cannot live without flowers and trees, so flowers and trees were also planted. Because modern houses are often standardized and all have the same style, Yu Danyun found that style somewhat annoying, so Lin Jiancheng pleased his wife and selected several houses with different styles and asked her to choose one.

### An Interview with Photographer Xu Ming

— Yinyan

I once happened to see a very magnificent photograph in a British magazine published in London, "The Amateur Photographer." The main subject was a giant ship, and the angle and lighting were beautiful and eye-catching. The caption stated that it was a work by Hsu Ming shagai. It is rare to see works by Chinese photographers in foreign photography publications. Suddenly, I saw that it was a work from Shanghai, and the Pinyin clearly indicated that it was a Chinese person. However, this name was not only unheard of in China, but also could not be found in any photography organization. At the time, I could only wonder in my heart. One evening, I went to Jing'an Temple Road for something and happened to step into a Suzhou candy store to buy some things. On the clean glass counter, I found a pleasing photograph of pine trees and white clouds, which was taken very well. The technique had the same majestic momentum as the one published in the previous magazine. I suspected that it came from the same hand, and carefully inquired with the clerk, only to learn that it was made by their boss, Mr. Xu, but they only knew that his name was "Wenxi" and not Hsu Ming.

Under my sincere request to meet him, Mr. Xu did come out. We exchanged business cards and learned that the Chinese name of this internationally renowned photographer was "Xu Ming." Wenxi was his alias. Because of our shared interests, we had a very投機 chat.

He is a young man around twenty-five or six years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang. His eyes are bright, thin, and energetic, and his pronunciation is loud and his speech is very straightforward. After we talked for an hour, we became good friends.

He has been fond of photography for four or five years. In the past two years, he has participated in major international salons and has won numerous awards and medals. He is recognized internationally as a new artist and has joined the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain for further research.

Mr. Xu has also been selected by the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain as an Associate member of "Artistic Mastery." This degree requires both qualifications and academics and is not easy to be elected. He is the first person in China to achieve this honor.

### An Open Letter From Loretta Young to a British Magazine

Loretta Young can truly be considered one of the leading stars in Hollywood today. Her new work, "Eternally Yours," has just finished screening at the Nanjing Grand Theater in this city. Ladies from all walks of life have expressed great admiration for her moving performance in the film. She once wrote an open letter to a British magazine.

At the beginning, she said: "From the letters of fans, I know that the general audience is always looking forward to seeing today's red stars being able to shoot more films and give them a deeper impression. But this is impossible, because when an actor is filming a movie, he often works all day and all night, so after a movie is made, he must get a short period of rest. For this reason, many actors only shoot three movies a year, and I, at most, shoot no more than eight."

Then, she talked a bit about her private affairs, saying: "I now live in Bel Air, which not many people know, so I can avoid a lot of unnecessary disputes. During the filming process, I pay special attention to my clothes, because there are often many photojournalists around me. During holidays, I travel around; but my itinerary is mysterious, otherwise, I am afraid I will suffer unexpected encounters."

Next, she talked about the minimum conditions that an actor should possess:

"First, do not ignore the opinions and wishes of the audience, otherwise, you will not get their support, and your reputation will inevitably decline. Second, whether it is every move, every word, especially female actors, should pay attention to everything. Because there are often many idlers who like to use us to spread rumors or create something out of nothing."

Finally, she said: "A person should dress decently, but not too luxuriously; if you have nothing to do, you may want to run outside, but you cannot overdo it; in the process of life, pride and waste are the two most undesirable things. Everywhere we should have an attitude of compassion and tolerance."

In conclusion, she gave a warning to fans: "In your eyes, you often think that the life and work of an actor who dedicates himself to the screen is meaningless. I will use practical spirit to eliminate this sentence."

### Wang Chen in Northern Shaanxi

— Pei Fei

Wang Chen, everyone knows that she is the wife of "Tiger" Zheng Junli.

Wang Chen is from Suzhou, but she grew up in Shanghai. After graduating from Qixiu Girls' High School, she went to Jiangwan Shanghai Business College.

Her acquaintance with Junli was very accidental. It was in the Republic of China in the fourth year, a week before the second public performance of "The Government Inspector" by the Shanghai Amateur Drama Association, Junli was rehearsing at the Jincheng Grand Theater, and a Miss Qu (?) (a friend of Gu Menghu) brought Wang Chen to visit. She casually introduced them; who would have thought that just this "meeting" would sow the seeds of love between them, and they would quickly get married on the 25th of October of the following year in the West Hall on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA?

After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, this newly married couple left their old home in Shanghai and joined the National Salvation Drama Troupe. From Wuxi through Suzhou to Nanjing and Hankou, and later to Chongqing, they never left the position of theater workers from beginning to end.

Recently, a friend's letter from the interior mentioned their recent situation, saying that Wang Chen had recently entered the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region College and was discussing the theory of national salvation with Li Lin (former Mingxing actress) every day, looking very hardworking; her husband Junli was in Lanzhou, and after staying for a few days, he would probably return to Chongqing.

### Guan Dayuan plays (Huang Zhong)

### Li Hongchun plays (Guan Gong)

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

Guan Dayuan is good at performing old plays such as Yong'an Palace and Hanyang Yuan.

The plot of the play is probably about Liu Bei's defeat by Cao Cao in the battle of Runan. Fortunately, Sun Qian intervened, so he went to rely on Liu Biao, the governor of Jingzhou. Biao treated him very well, but he was bewitched by the words of his successor, Mrs. Cai, and sent Bei to Xinye. Later, Biao became seriously ill and summoned him again, entrusting him with matters after his death. Cao Cao knew that Bei would eventually be a threat to him, so he openly made peace while secretly raising troops. Bei received the letter and rushed back to Xinye, realizing that he could not match the enemy in strength, so he led the old, young, and people to abandon the city and flee. When passing through Jingzhou, Liu Biao had already died. The defending generals Cai Mao and Zhang Yun had advised Biao's second son, Cong, to surrender to Cao Cao upon hearing of Cao Cao's arrival. Bei could not help but grieve greatly for failing the heavy trust. He passed through the Hanyang Plain east of Xiangyang City, visited Liu Biao's tomb, and wrote an eulogy to mourn him. The above is a brief description of the play. This play includes Xipi Daoban, Yuanban, Liushui, and Fanxipi, etc. People say that Liu Bei is a hero, accustomed to being hypocritical and buying people's hearts. Therefore, Cao Cao occupies the right time, Sun Quan gets the geographical advantage, and Liu Bei gets the people's support, thus forming a three-legged situation. However, Bei's weeping for Liu Biao is actually weeping for the people to see. Therefore, the lyrics of Fanxipi include a set of words to buy people's hearts: "It is truly regrettable, the good people of Fancheng and Xinye, watching them one by one, supporting the old and carrying the young, climbing mountains and wading through water, embarking on the journey, I am so heartbroken!..." When the people heard it, they would of course rather die than leave this benevolent lord. Therefore, the actor who plays this play must first be able to express Liu Bei's love for the people like his own children to be considered to have grasped the true meaning of the play. Although the name of the play is "Crying for Liu Biao," the main point is still on the people. Because Liu's deep popularity with the people started with this, the performer must know this. Dayuan came to Shanghai and showed his beauty to the people. I very much hope that he can perform this kind of old play that is about to be lost, and I expect it will be very popular. (159)
