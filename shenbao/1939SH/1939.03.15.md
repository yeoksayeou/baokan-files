Editorial

### On the Reporting of Guerrilla Warfare Zones

People like to call Shanghai an isolated island, because its land transportation is frequently cut off, and only ships can navigate the seas, which is indeed similar to an isolated island. Furthermore, with the obstruction of human affairs around it, the situation appears even more isolated. The news industry relies on a wide population and smooth transportation as its basic conditions. Shanghai is particularly isolated, and the news industry is facing great difficulties. The difficulty lies in the industry itself, which is seeking its own way out, but this is not enough to be used as material for newspaper discussion. However, there is one thing that is a product of the current special state, and I would like to ask those who care about newspapers to cooperate.

What is this matter? The descriptions that readers pay the most attention to are war reports. War reports come from the war zone, which is divided into two categories: one is the extended front war zone, and the other is the vast guerrilla war zone. The front war zone is a line or a point, while the guerrilla war zone is a plane or even a three-dimensional space. Speaking of the line, it stretches from northern Shanxi in the north to Hainan in the south. Among them, eastern Hebei, southern Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and western Zhejiang are all points, which are very extensive. Speaking of the guerrilla war zone, the area between Jiangsu and Zhejiang is centered on Taihu Lake, Pudong is centered on Nanhui, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are centered on Tongchonghai, and northern Anhui is centered on Hongze Lake. Furthermore, from eastern Shandong, southern Hebei, and northern Henan to Suiyuan, Rehe, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, it is extremely vast. The war reports from the front war zone are transmitted from the front line to the rear, converging in Chongqing, and broadcast at home and abroad, which is fast, detailed, and accurate. The isolated island is the same as Washington, London, and Hong Kong, and also the same as Chongqing. It has never lagged behind due to the special state. However, there are great difficulties in the war reports about the guerrilla war zone.

Reporters cannot go deep into the guerrilla war zone to conduct interviews in person, and there are many reasons for this. Or they have gone deep, or the original news network has not been completely destroyed, but the information obtained from the interviews still cannot be regularly supplied to the newspapers. Therefore, newspapers must find another way to collect war reports from the guerrilla war zone. For more than a year, the newspapers have published a lot of guerrilla reports, which were not easy to obtain. However, because the interviews and supply cannot be fully in line with the normal track, problems inevitably arise in terms of speed, detail, and preparation from time to time. Especially because the society's expectations are high, it often spurs and blames them. Several points are listed as examples: First, guerrilla warfare in various regions has many arduous and outstanding innovations. People with lofty ideals have fallen one after another, succeeding or sacrificing themselves. Their people and their deeds are enough to be announced to the world and future generations. How should we promote them as much as possible to praise the martyrs and inspire future generations? However, they are ignored by the newspapers, and their loyal bones rot with the grass and trees, and their names are buried and not revealed. If they dedicate themselves to the country and nation, and are nameless heroes, they will sacrifice themselves for the country and be at peace with themselves. They only hope that the War of Resistance will be won and the country will be built, and they can smile in the afterlife. Why should they compete for fame for a hundred generations? However, are the vigorous and heroic deeds not the ideal objects for newspapers to draw material from? Why are they not recorded? Second, some traitors have internal conflicts, and their plans are exposed. They are noisy and disturbing, and even the chickens and dogs are uneasy. Or rogues steal and commit crimes, or private feuds are sought after, and they engage in fighting and weapons. The villages are full of false alarms. Or gunshots are heard in the middle of the night, and it is not known where they come from. Or robbery happens on the road, and it is not known where they go. The pursuit of the truth is just the arrogance and abuse of power. However, the newspapers are ignorant of the truth, and they promote their words and say that the guerrillas attacked, fought fiercely, annihilated the enemy, punished the traitors, and returned with great success and retreat with the whole division. Those who do not know the truth only see that the situation remains the same, and they will lament the futility of their efforts. Those who know the reality take one example as a hundred, and think that such guerrilla warfare can not be short-lived? The isolated island is close to the Taihu Lake guerrilla area, and also separated from Nanhui and Tongchonghai by the river. It is more convenient to see and hear, and there are more records. However, according to those who come from these places, the inaccuracies in the guerrilla reports recorded in various newspapers are also 20-30%.

All these accusations are gradually becoming ashamed of by the reporters, and they are also the responsibilities that the newspapers will never shirk. How should we make the vigorous and heroic deeds recorded and published in the future? How should we make all kinds of false rumors disappear from the newspapers? This is what the reporters should strive for. However, with the blockade of Shanghai's return, and the fact that the news agency is inferior to peacetime, we have to expect those who are enlightened. In this second phase of the War of Resistance, guerrilla tactics are becoming more and more important, and the number of guerrilla units has greatly increased. The recent Chongqing telecommunications have also proved that its organization and command have sound and unified methods. Therefore, it is not only the attention and needs of newspaper readers to make rapid, detailed, and accurate propaganda for the reality of the guerrilla area, but also to cherish the guerrilla units and promote the necessary functions of guerrilla warfare. Since the propaganda promotes its functions, it is necessary to commend its merits. Since the propaganda cherishes its troops, it is necessary to distinguish the true from the false, and to expose the rogues who take advantage of the name of guerrilla warfare to commit evils, in order to correct the vision of the general public. This kind of effort is the newspaper's unshirkable responsibility, but we firmly believe that if people from all walks of life give reporters more help, the effect will be even greater. For example, people in the Taihu Lake area will never allow the merits of the Taihu Lake guerrillas to be buried and not revealed, and will not sit idly by and watch the situation of the Taihu Lake guerrillas being misrepresented, and will not allow the traitors, bandits, and local bullies in the Taihu Lake area to defile the reputation of the guerrillas. Extrapolating to other places, it is the same everywhere. This is not only a question of the truth of the newspaper news, but also a way to promote the functions of guerrilla warfare, which is also a way to accelerate the achievement of the second phase of the War of Resistance.

### Generalissimo Chiang Sends Telegram Congratulating the Opening of the Third Council of the Academia Sinica. When Enemy Countries Become a Problem, Scholars Should Redouble Their Efforts to Wipe Out Humiliation and Strengthen Themselves. Academic Research Should Grasp the Needs of the Times.

(Kunming) Generalissimo Chiang sent a telegram of congratulations to the Third Council of the Academia Sinica, which read: "To President Cai of the Academia Sinica in Kunming and all gentlemen, the Third Council of the Academia Sinica is meeting in Kunming, bringing together leaders from the academic circles of the country to review the achievements of past specialized research, determine the direction of future academic advancement, and gather ideas and insights to benefit the country. Zhongzheng believes that a country on this earth cannot be established without learning. Now that the country is in the midst of foreign troubles from enemy countries, scholars should redouble their efforts to wipe out humiliation and strengthen themselves. Resistance and national construction rely on the succession of experts and the tireless efforts of the academic community. Their contributions are no less than the blood sacrifices of soldiers on the battlefield. Speaking of the extreme of invention and creation, it is often the source of military victory, and it often starts from the slightest and achieves far-reaching results. The invention of one thing and one principle is enough to reverse the entire war situation and change the future of human life. The past achievements in academic history are clear, and why would the descendants of the Yellow Emperor be willing to lag behind others? The so-called academics cannot be limited to one style. Pure science and applied science are like the roots and branches, each with its own wonderful use. Humanities and natural sciences are also like the hands, feet, ears, and eyes, which cannot be neglected. It is ignorant to distinguish their importance. Now that the country is in this extraordinary situation, to overcome the enemy and win victory, we must give priority to benefiting the war. To imitate and build, we must give priority to revival and construction. It is not a time for academic leisure and entertainment, but a time for people with aspirations to generously serve the country. The order of urgency should be established and used as a model. Only by making a real contribution to the current national economy can we establish the position of our country's academics in the world. Zhongzheng also believes that in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, all academics that can stand out and be remembered forever are due to grasping the needs of the times, which can satisfy the minds of the majority of people. Now the world is turbulent, and the tide is urgent. It is up to no one else to help the falling and rescue the drowning. I hope that you gentlemen will examine the needs of the country and the people, explore the origins of world education and human heart, and formulate strategies to promote the glory of our culture and promote the great cause of our revolution. I offer my thoughts, and my words do not fully express my meaning. I wish your conference success. Chiang Kai-shek." (Fourteenth day dispatch)

### Foreign Observers Discuss the General Situation between China and Japan: The Great Powers are Determined to Aid China, Japan is Provoking a World War

(Chongqing) According to a foreign military observer, since the news of US aid to China with huge sums of money came out, it has caused an uproar in Japan from top to bottom. All kinds of absurd behaviors are due to the Tokyo authorities' unclear understanding of the situation. At this time, the great powers' aid to China is a proper move. If they continue to stand idly by, their own interests will be stripped away. In other words, it is simply giving it to Japan. Since the start of the war of aggression against China, Japan has been threatening the interests of the great powers in China step by step, such as the issue of opening the Yangtze River, which has been delayed for various reasons. Therefore, the remarks of the Tokyo side are just bluster. In fact, Japan has no ability to stop the great powers from aiding China, and the countries aiding China will never stop aiding because of Japan's opposition. The observer finally said that according to the current situation, Japan knows that the war of aggression against China will end indefinitely, so it is enraged and recklessly acts in China, while the great powers will always be the backing of China, which is beyond doubt. However, when Japan is financially exhausted, it will join its two European allies at all costs and will not hesitate to provoke World War II. (Fourteenth day Express News Agency dispatch)

This protest by the United States is taking the same action as Britain. It is said that the content of the note is roughly the same as the one sent to Japan by the United States on October 6. According to information revealed by U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles, the United States has repeatedly protested because Japan's plan in North China endangers U.S. interests and violates U.S. treaty rights. Furthermore, American merchants in North China have been affected by Japan's currency system and export regulations, causing American commerce there to suffer a "fatal blow." Therefore, they petitioned the State Department last week for protection, and the State Department, based on this, once again protested to Japan. (Associated Press dispatch on the 14th)

(Washington) Under Secretary of State Welles stated today that the United States has protested to Japan against the new currency plan implemented in North China, and especially opposes the forced circulation of Japanese currency to exclude Chinese legal tender. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th) (London) British Under Secretary of State Butler announced in the House of Commons today that Britain will negotiate with Japan, stating that the currency regulations recently promulgated by Japan in North China greatly hinder the legitimate commercial interests of the British. The so-called Chinese Provisional Government has announced that from March 11, twelve special commodities will not be allowed to be exported unless foreign exchange is sold at a price of 14 pence using "Federal Reserve" banknotes. These twelve commodities account for the main part of North China's export trade. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)

(London) The Chinese government and Sandgrouse Aircraft Ltd. signed a contract at the Chinese Embassy this afternoon. China has ordered 200 three-and-a-half-ton trucks and 100 seven-ton trucks. The latter are all equipped with eight-ton trailers. The total value will be £2,230,011, including parts and repair equipment worth approximately £30,884. Payment of the loan is guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee Department. All of these trucks will be delivered in Rangoon. The first batch of light trucks will be delivered within four weeks, and the first batch of heavy trucks will be delivered within eight weeks. (Reuters on the 14th) (London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced in the House of Commons today that he will submit a bill tomorrow to complete the Sino-British financial agreement and assist China's stabilization fund. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)

(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, opposition Labour Party member Bellenger asked Foreign Secretary Simon whether the operation of the Chinese legal tender balance fund was the same as that of the British exchange balance fund, and whether the British government had consulted other countries regarding the Chinese legal tender balance fund, as if Britain, France, and the United States had consulted each other in accordance with the monetary agreement. Foreign Secretary Simon immediately replied, "I intend to submit the necessary legal bill tomorrow, at which time it can be submitted for discussion." Bellenger then asked, "I will wait for this bill, but I don't know if the Chancellor can agree to answer my questions when he submits this bill." The Chancellor replied again, "It may be necessary to issue a statement regarding the operation of the Chinese legal tender balance fund." (Havas dispatch on the 14th)

### Tianjin Concessions Threatened; Britain to Protest to Japan Again

(London) London has received intelligence that there is a pro-Japanese terrorist committee outside the British and French concessions in Tianjin, whose purpose is to carry out terrorist acts in the concessions and then escape outside the boundaries. It is expected that the British government will continue to protest to Japan regarding the installation of an electric fence in Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)

### British House of Commons Discusses the Resumption of Navigation on the Yangtze River; The British Government Contacts the Naval Commander and Attaches Importance to the Current Situation in the Tianjin Concessions

(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Conservative Party member Moreing asked whether the government had devised a safe and rapid way for more than 100 British expatriates in Hankou, China, to travel to Shanghai, and for a large number of expatriates in Shanghai to travel to Hankou for business reasons. Under Secretary of State Butler of the Foreign Office immediately replied, "The Foreign Office is actively considering this situation." Moreing also asked, "Is the Foreign Office aware that the Japanese army does not allow British ships to sail on the Yangtze River and does not allow British expatriates to board Japanese ships? Regarding the restoration of navigation on the Yangtze River to protect the legitimate business of Britain and other countries, does the Foreign Office intend to contact the commander of the British fleet in China to take appropriate measures?" Under Secretary of State Butler replied again, "This matter is of great importance, and the Foreign Office has indeed consulted with the commander of the fleet in China." (Havas dispatch on the 13th) (London) Under Secretary of State Butler made a statement on the situation in Tianjin in the House of Commons today, stating that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie sent a note to the Japanese Foreign Minister on March 4, explaining the legitimate attitude adopted by the British authorities in Tianjin and requesting the Japanese government to pay attention to the various actions taken against the British concession in Tianjin, and to issue instructions as soon as possible to urge the local Japanese authorities to adopt a more moderate attitude. Labour Party member Noel-Baker asked if it was true that the British concession in Tianjin had gradually become a Japanese detention center. Butler replied that it was not true, but the seriousness of the situation was not lessened by this answer. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th) (London) Under Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Britain has submitted 22 protests to the Japanese government regarding cases of damage to British people or their property, of which the Japanese side has apologized for nine cases, compensated for four cases, and agreed to compensate for three cases. A member asked whether the British government had received a reply after sending a note to the Japanese government on the issue of the open door policy in China. Butler replied that the British government, in view of the Japanese government's formal declaration, issued a note stating the British government's attitude towards the situation in the Far East, and has not yet received a reply. The question of when to reply is of course a matter for the Japanese government to decide. Butler later mentioned the bombing of the Robertson Hospital in Xi'an, saying that the hospital was directly hit by Japanese aircraft three times, destroying the dissecting room, the X-ray department, the machine room, and two hospital buildings. All of these buildings had two British flags as identification. One Chinese nurse died, but no foreigners were injured. The British government immediately protested to the Japanese government and reserved the right to demand compensation. A member also asked whether the Japanese side had requested 32 positions in the Guangzhou Customs. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax was aware of this request, but had not yet indicated acceptance. However, in any case, the British government has made it clear that the current changes in the personnel of the Chinese Customs are only temporary measures, and must be reconsidered when the war ends. Butler also said that the new bridge over the Hai River between the Italian and Japanese concessions in Tianjin has been completed and opened to traffic on March 10. However, this bridge is upstream of the British and French concessions, so it seems that there is no need to find a way to deal with it. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)

### British Foreign Secretary's Speech: Expanding Military Preparations Without Forgetting Peace; Funding for Social Undertakings Still Exceeds Military Spending, and Journalists are Advised to Record Things Carefully

(London) British Foreign Secretary Halifax gave a speech in Sunderland last night, stating that the figures for Britain's rearmament are so large and have been so widely publicized in newspapers that the huge sums of money that the country spends on social undertakings each year are sometimes overshadowed by them, so they are not noticed by the general public. In the total amount of this year's budget, national defense accounts for 26.8%, while social undertakings account for 29.6%. Even at this time of unprecedentedly large military expenditure, the expenditure on social undertakings still exceeds many other items. Even in the estimated figures for next year's budget, the expenditure allocated for social undertakings exceeds the total amount of public debt (excluding the various public debts used for the military buildup program) by £28,000,000. Therefore, it cannot be said that the government is exploiting the health and daily lives of the British people and wasting taxpayers' money on cannons, warships, and airplanes. If we ignore the expenditure on strengthening military preparations, we will suffer the consequences ourselves. Since we are enthusiastic about improving the living conditions of the people, we must guarantee their safety and give the country sufficient strength to protect their rights and interests and maintain their independence. At present, in addition to the events that are currently happening, the air is often filled with alarming rumors of impending disasters. He feared that the people of the country would not carefully distinguish between facts and rumors. There are some people who, for whatever reason, like to spread rumors or spread distortions. This is why the responsibility of the press is so great. Britain has complete freedom of speech, and this responsibility is even greater. He wanted to appeal to editors, reporters, and readers of newspapers to give close consideration to all news concerning the ambitions of foreign governments. Distorting or sensationalizing foreign news not only endangers oneself, but can also lead to the failure of the goals of various political parties. As far as the government is concerned, its actions are not influenced by irresponsible speculation, but it will continue to take any necessary steps while continuing to pursue peace to ensure that the country has the strength and self-confidence required by its position and environment. The government will devote itself to this, because it is confident that it can make as great a contribution as any other country to the creation of a better world. While faithfully fulfilling its primary responsibility to the people of the country, the government will also not neglect the opportunity to sincerely engage with other governments to eliminate misunderstandings and suspicions and strengthen the forces of peace. Halifax then recounted the international situation, saying that in his opinion, if Britain had not maintained its consistent policy on major international disputes in the past few years, there would have been a serious risk of triggering a European war each time. Some have said that the British government's actions on Minorca were an intervention in the Spanish Civil War, but this is not the case. Actions to facilitate discussions between the two sides did not detract from Britain's neutrality. Britain did this to save lives. At that time, the Nationalist forces had decided to attack Minorca, and the island's defenders did not have the opportunity to effectively resist or obtain assistance. As a result, the people were subjected to more suffering. The British warship did not intervene or mediate, but was ordered to transport Spanish negotiators. Useless sacrifices were thus avoided. The British government has made a contribution to peace and humanity, which both sides admired. As for Britain's recognition of the Nationalist government, it was not an endorsement of its political system, but because it was obeyed by the majority of the people in that country, it was an authority that other governments had to have official relations with.

### The Situation in Spain is Chaotic; Madrid Returns to Normal

(London) Under Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today that the situation in central Spain remains extremely chaotic, and the British government has not contacted either the Republican or Nationalist sides to negotiate peace terms. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th) Madrid: Madrid has fully returned to normal today. In addition to the tram service, which was restored yesterday, the subway coming from the west has also reopened. Shops have reopened, and women are lined up outside bakeries waiting to buy bread, as they have not been able to get bread for three or four days. Theaters and cinemas have also reopened. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th) Madrid: Colonel Casado recently told a Reuters reporter that reports that the Communist Party had launched an uprising in Cartagena were completely unfounded. The areas under the control of the Republican government are now completely peaceful. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)

### Reports of Czechoslovakia's Dissolution are Rushed

(Berlin) Newspapers recently used large headlines to publish news of "The Complete Dissolution of Czechoslovakia." Observers familiar with the situation expect that the independent state of Slovakia will be directly controlled by Germany, and Germany will make up for the budget deficit. As for the Czech core territory, namely Bohemia and Moravia, it will be temporarily occupied by German troops until the Germans in those provinces can enjoy all kinds of rights. In addition, Carpathian Ruthenia will be ceded to Hungary, regardless of whether the Ukrainian people resist. Although German officials are quite secretive about this, Hungary's advance into the province has probably been approved by the German government. In short, the situation in Europe will become more tense due to the Mediterranean issue and the colonial issue. The German government is eager to seek the sympathy of Poland and Hungary. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)

(Berlin) Regarding the situation in Czechoslovakia, external reports state that the German government has presented the country with an ultimatum. Official sources here say they know nothing about it. It is rumored that Germany has been mobilizing troops on the border of Czechoslovakia. Although this has been denied, it is still widely rumored. Observers are currently commenting that the German government has been greatly disappointed with the attitude of the Czechoslovak government since June, and has now decided to change the situation created by the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration (the arbitration on the demarcation of the border between Czechoslovakia and Hungary), and will take decisive measures to change the current federal system. If the province of Slovakia declares independence, then Carpathian Ukraine will be completely separated from other parts of Czechoslovakia and will not be able to exist independently. It is only possible to cede it to Hungary. If so, Poland will not have to fear the Pan-Ukrainian movement, and Poland's desire to be connected to Hungarian territory can be fulfilled. (Havas dispatch on the 13th) (Berlin) The situation in Czechoslovakia was recently commented on by people close to the German Foreign Ministry, saying that the domestic situation in the country is extremely chaotic. The faction of former President Benes, encouraged by U.S. President Roosevelt, wants to take back the autonomy rights previously granted to the Slovak and Ukrainian peoples. The Czechs have not yet understood the lessons they have learned in June, which can be seen from this. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)

### Stalin's Report (Continued, Part 3)

"In terms of production technology and the speed of industrial development, we have surpassed the major capitalist countries, which is very good, but still not enough. We must also surpass them economically. We can do this, and we must do it. Only by economically surpassing other major capitalist countries can our country have a large number of consumer goods and products, allowing us to transition from the first stage of communism to the second.

Agriculture has also steadily increased during this period. This increase is not only reflected in the increase in agricultural products, but also in the increase in socialist agriculture and the reduction in private agriculture. The grain production of collective farms increased from 7.5 million hectares in 1933 to 9.2 million hectares in 1938. Private production decreased from 5.7 million hectares in 1933 to 600,000 hectares in 1938. Collective farms now include 18.8 million farm households, accounting for 93.50% of the total. This number does not include collective fishing grounds and collective handicrafts. This proves that collective farms have become strong and stable, and the socialist system is the most suitable farm system for our country.

Stalin then listed figures to illustrate the cultivated area and equipment of collective farms, electric plows, harvesters, and other machines of state farms. The number of electric plows used was 210,900 in 1933, 276,400 in 1934, 360,300 in 1935, 422,700 in 1936, 454,500 in 1937, and 483,500 in 1938, an increase of more than 100% in six years. The number of harvesters in 1933 was 25,400, and in 1938 it was 153,500, an increase of more than 500%.

Stalin said that our country's agriculture is consistently ranked first in the world, being the most mechanized agriculture in the world, and therefore has the largest market in the world. At the same time, it also uses the most machines compared to other countries.

The progress of industry and agriculture is accompanied by the development of domestic trade.

The business of national and collective trade increased by 178%, and the retail sales of collective farms increased by 112%.

The progress of workers and peasants will lead to an increase in the standard of living, and this is indeed the case.

The phenomena of unemployment, homeless farmers wandering and starving to death, and begging for relief no longer exist. This period has long passed. Today, we may as well ask collective farms to produce at least 1.5 million young collective farmers each year for industrial production. Collective farms are very wealthy, and it should be remembered that without their assistance, our country's industry would be difficult to develop. And if industry does not develop, the industrial products needed by farmers cannot be satisfied. With the full development of their skills, they should be able to supply a part of their labor force for industrial use. The use of this labor force in industry will be a great gain for the national economy. The country's total revenue was 48.5 billion rubles in 1933 and 105 billion rubles in 1938. The number of workers and employees was more than 22 million in 1933 and 28 million in 1938. The annual salaries of workers and employees increased from 24.953 billion rubles in 1933 to 92.425 billion rubles in 1938. "In 1933, the average annual salary per industrial worker was 1,513 rubles, which increased to 3,447 rubles in 1938. In 1933, the total cash income of collective farms was 5,661.9 million rubles, which increased to 14,180.1 million rubles in 1937. In 1933, each collective farmer in the grain area received 61 poods of grain, which increased to 144 poods in 1937, excluding emergency reserve seeds, fodder for special livestock, grain taxes, and in-kind goods for remuneration of machine tractor station work." The expenditure on special items and cultural development in the national budget increased from 5,839.9 million rubles in 1933 to 35,202.5 million rubles in 1938. The cultural development of the people during this period is equivalent to a cultural revolution. The popularization of applied national languages and compulsory primary education have been implemented nationwide. The number of schools at all levels has increased countless times, and the number of students has also increased significantly. The number of specialized talents who have received university education is increasing day by day. A new Soviet intelligentsia has been produced and consolidated. The emergence of this new socialist, people's intelligentsia is the most important achievement of our country's cultural revolution.

"In addition, one of the most important achievements during this period is the further consolidation of the domestic status and the further consolidation of the Soviet regime. The characteristic that distinguishes Soviet society from any capitalist society at present is that there are no conflicting or opposing classes within it, the exploiting classes have been eliminated, and the workers, peasants, and intellectuals who constitute this society live and work on the basis of mutual harmony and cooperation. It is on this basis that various forces such as the moral and political unity of Soviet society, the friendship of all nationalities, and Soviet patriotism are able to develop. It is on this basis that the Soviet Constitution, passed in November 1936, and the thorough democratization of the elections of the highest organs in the country were produced. Due to this purity and internal unity, the rear and front lines of the Red Army in wartime will be stronger than any country. This is what those abroad who prefer armed conflict must remember."

"Some foreign newspaper spokespersons have spread absurd rumors, claiming that the purge of spies, assassins, and saboteurs such as Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Yakir, Tukhachevsky, Rosenholz, and Bukharin from Soviet organizations has 'weakened the strength of the Soviet regime' and caused turmoil. This kind of nonsense is laughable. In common sense, shouldn't the purge of such spies, assassins, and saboteurs from Soviet organizations make those organizations stronger? Even the Lake Khasan incident cannot prove that purging spies and saboteurs is the best way to strengthen the aforementioned organizations." (To be continued)

### Czech President and Foreign Minister Fly to Berlin Together; Slovak Leader Visits Hitler to Seek Assistance

Czech Capital: President Hácha has flown to Berlin with Foreign Minister Chvalkovský to meet with Führer Hitler. (Havas, March 14)

(Berlin) Former Prime Minister Tiso of the Slovak Province of Czechoslovakia, accompanied by former Minister of Transport Ďurčanský and German Party leader Karmasin of the Slovak Province, paid homage to Führer Hitler at 5:00 PM today to discuss the situation in Czechoslovakia. According to a communiqué issued afterwards, "Führer Hitler, together with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, received Slovak Prime Minister Tiso and Minister of Transport Ďurčanský this afternoon and held talks on current issues." Observers here commented that the new government of the Slovak Province has not yet been recognized by Germany, as can be seen from the wording of the communiqué. In addition, the German government is expected to send a note to the Czech government demanding two things: (1) the restoration of the Tiso cabinet; and (2) the dismissal of Czech central government cabinet members responsible for the incident, especially Defense Minister General Jansa and Czech Autonomous Government Prime Minister and Interior Minister Fiala. (Havas, March 13) Bratislava: The Slovak Autonomous Party in this city held a demonstration near the Carlton Hotel this afternoon, demanding independence for the province. About 1,500 people participated. The party's 200-member defense force also participated in uniform, attracting much attention. Party leader Sano Mach delivered a speech, stating that "The central government's sudden order on the 10th of this month to reorganize the autonomous government of this province is inappropriate. If the relationship between the Czech and Slovak peoples is to be thoroughly resolved, there is no other way but Slovak independence." In addition, an explosion occurred near the office of the Aza Newspaper, but there were no casualties. Police are patrolling all major thoroughfares to maintain order. The city is generally peaceful. (Havas, March 13)

Bratislava: A bomb explosion occurred in front of the city hall of this city at 10:15 PM, killing six people. (Havas, March 13) (Berlin) A certain official here told a Reuters reporter that Germany had not presented an ultimatum to the Czech government and had not had any direct contact with the Czech government. (Reuters, March 14)

### Soviet Communist Party Congress Discusses the Situation in Ukraine, All People of the Republic Support Stalin and Will Resolutely Strike Down Any Invaders

(Moscow) The 18th National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party continued yesterday. First, the secretary of the Central Executive Committee of the party, Khrushchev, delivered a speech explaining the national economic development and the cultural facilities of the Ukrainian Republic. "The people of the Ukrainian Republic have achieved unprecedented unity centered on the Communist Party and Stalin. Any fascist aggressors who dare to attack will inevitably encounter a powerful counterattack." The People's Commissar of Defense, General Voroshilov, then spoke, reporting on various measures taken by the government to strengthen national defense. All the representatives applauded warmly after hearing this, expressing their welcome. In addition, General Stern, commander of the First Far Eastern Army Group, also delivered a speech, detailing the combat situation of the Red Army during the Zhanggufeng Incident. (Havas dispatch from the 14th) (Moscow) Khrushchev said in his speech, "We have heard the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in the Congress. Soviet Ukraine is rich in infinite treasures, with countless coal, manganese, wheat, beet, cotton, etc. However, the greatest resource of Ukraine is still its freedom-loving people. In the past, various adventurers have attempted to enslave the Ukrainian people, but the fate of the German knights and Polish gentry will be a lesson for all such delusions in the future. The Ukrainian people have repelled such arrogance more than once, but they seem to have forgotten the past. Fascist bandits are now sending spies into our territory and buying traitors in the hope of realizing their dreams. They should know that we will thoroughly annihilate them, like poisonous insects and beasts." "During the Second Five-Year Plan, the production of pig iron in Ukraine has increased by two and a half times. The output of the Kirov Iron and Steel Plant alone is twice the total steel production of Poland. The steel produced in the entire Ukraine is equal to the sum of Japan, Italy, and Poland. The coal produced in Ukraine is also twice that of Poland. They should all seriously consider these facts. "Ninety-six point seven percent of Ukrainian farmers have joined collective farms, and the cultivated land of collective farms accounts for ninety-one point seven percent of the entire republic. Ukraine has sufficient agricultural machinery. In 1934, the cultivated land harvested by combine harvesters only accounted for two percent of the entire republic, but now it has reached fifty percent. The harvesting of beets has been mechanized. All of this has greatly shortened the time required to complete cultivation and made the actions of collective farmers easier. Animal husbandry has also developed. From 1924 to the present, cattle have increased by two times, sheep and goats have increased by more than two times, and pigs have almost tripled. The income of collective farmers has continued to increase. From 1934 to 1938, the cash income of farms increased to three and a half times, and the income distributed to farmers according to working days increased by more than five times. "We dare to declare to those fascist bandits who dream of Ukrainian wheat," "Don't dream of Ukrainian bread, because bread is what the Ukrainian people love. If you dare to intervene in our Soviet garden, we will respectfully greet you with our fists." "Ukrainian culture is also becoming increasingly prosperous. The funding for schools at all levels has increased from 14.1 million rubles in 1927 to 28.3 million rubles. The total salary of teachers has reached 11.06 million rubles. From 1933 to 1938, many schools have been added, especially middle schools, reaching 2,531, which is ten times that of 1932-33. The number of middle school students has also increased from 224,000 to 1,709,000 in the past five years." In 1914, Ukraine only had 19 higher education institutions with 26,000 students. Now, it has increased to 121 institutions with 122,000 students. During the First Five-Year Plan, a total of 39,000 specialized talents graduated from such schools, while during the Second Five-Year Plan, it reached 64,000. For hundreds of years, the Ukrainian people have fought with the Tsarist government for the right to study in their native language and develop their national culture. This aspiration was only realized after the victory of Lenin and Stalin's national policy. That is why the Ukrainian people shout "Long live Stalin!" (Warm applause). Now, the Ukrainian people are united as never before in supporting the Party and Stalin. All fascist aggressors will be crushed before this kind of unity. Once the Ukrainian people receive orders from the Party and the government, they will rise up to defend the socialist motherland. The unity of the Ukrainian people with the Russian nation and all the nations of the Soviet Union is a great and irresistible force. (TASS dispatch from the 14th)

### Population Increase and Transportation Inconvenience: Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces Are Planning to Regulate Food Supply

Guangxi Rice Prices Expected to Stabilize, Guangdong Province Decides to Establish a Grain Management Office

Hong Kong Correspondence: The grain issue is a major problem for Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The Liuzhou, Xunzhou, Wuzhou, and Yulin areas are known for surplus rice production. Every year, a large amount of grain and miscellaneous grains are produced, which, in addition to supplying the needs of the people in the entire area, is also exported in large quantities. The Guilin, Longzhou, and Baise areas have less production than the above areas, but if the weather is favorable, they can be self-sufficient in times of good harvests. In times of famine, they can rely on the transfer and assistance from the Liuzhou, Xunzhou, Wuzhou, and Yulin areas. The Guangxi provincial authorities often boast about their self-sufficiency policy, which is not without reason. However, since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, refugees from Hunan and Guangdong have flocked to Guangxi, resulting in a
sudden increase
of more than 2 million people in the population of Guangxi. The refugees from other provinces mostly reside between Guilin and Liuzhou. Guilin has historically been deficient in grain. Once the population increases dramatically, the demand for grain naturally exceeds the supply. As for the Longzhou and Baise areas above Nanning, the land is barren and not known for surplus rice production. In peaceful times, every spring, they feel a shortage of grain and must rely on continuous transportation and assistance from other areas. Now, with the tension of the war of resistance, the rivers and roads connecting the Guangdong border have all been destroyed. The policy of clearing the fields is strictly enforced, making grain transportation difficult. Even with assistance, the transportation costs are very high, which has led to a gradual increase in grain prices. According to the Guilin grain price report for this month, the price of good rice is 18 to 20 yuan per hundred pounds, and glutinous rice is 27 to 30 yuan per hundred pounds. The prices in Longzhou and Baise areas are about 10% to 15% lower than those in Guilin, and the prices in Xunzhou and Yulin areas are about 30% to 50% lower than those in Guilin. The huge difference in prices is due to the destruction of roads in various areas, the inconvenience of transportation, the increase in population, the shortage of production, and the slight drought in the upper reaches of the major rivers in the autumn. The people have little surplus grain in storage. The authorities are now
regulating the grain supply.
On the one hand, they are allocating huge sums of money and ships to purchase a large amount of grain from the Liuzhou, Wuzhou, and Yulin areas, transport it to the upper reaches for storage and sale, in order to suppress rice prices and prepare for famine. On the other hand, they are restricting wealthy people in various counties from hoarding grain and prohibiting rice merchants from monopolizing. However, looking at the overall grain problem in Guangxi, the shortage is only in a dozen remote counties. With some regulation by the authorities, the serious situation can be prevented from expanding. Moreover, farmers can still cultivate their land as usual, which makes it easier to maintain the grain supply than in other war zones. However, the situation is different in Guangdong Province. Many counties in the East, West, and North Rivers of Guangdong have been occupied by the Japanese army, causing chaos, traffic congestion, unrest for businesses, and insecurity for farmers. The grain problem is extremely serious. Currently, the price of rice in Guangzhou is only four and a half to five catties per one yuan of national currency. The rice prices in the occupied areas of Foshan, Chencun, Daliang, Guanshan, Jiujiang, and Sanshui are similar to those in Guangzhou. The grain prices in Zhaoqing, Jiangmen, and Siyi, which are adjacent to the war zone, are cheaper than those in the occupied areas, but still only about six and a half catties per yuan. Although Yingde and Shaoguan on the North River rely on
the import of Hunan rice,
the upper reaches of the North River are heavily garrisoned, and the demand for grain is higher than in other areas, so rice prices remain high. Chaozhou and Shantou and the East River can still transport foreign rice through the Youxia Port, which is connected to Hong Kong. However, the Chaozhou area lacks about 3 million piculs of rice every year, and the rice tax is too expensive, making the cost higher. Therefore, the supply of foreign rice is also difficult. Guangdong has always been a grain-deficient province. In normal times, it also relied on a large amount of imported foreign rice. Now, during the war of resistance, the coastal ports are often blockaded or harassed by Japanese warships, resulting in the interruption or reduction of foreign rice sources, which has put the entire province in a state of famine. Recently, it was reported that the chairman of the provincial government, Li Hanshun, ordered the abolition of the original Food Committee and the establishment of a Provincial Grain Management Office to comprehensively handle the grain affairs of the military and civilians in the province. At the moment when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is not yet in, the surplus rice areas in Guangdong have been emptied by unscrupulous merchants, and other areas are facing transportation difficulties due to traffic congestion. Grain prices are rising day by day, and the people are increasingly lacking food. It is hoped that those in charge of local affairs will urgently solve this serious problem.

### Japanese Warships Sail to Gaogang, Landing Unsuccessful

Taixian Correspondence: A Japanese warship sailed from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to Gaogang, Taixing on the morning of the 8th and docked in the river. At around 10 o'clock, a dozen Japanese soldiers landed in Gaogang. However, due to the strict defenses of the Chinese army, they returned to the warship at around 12 o'clock. In the afternoon, at around 3 o'clock, the warship moved to the west of Gaogang, but there was no further action. Also, on the morning of the 8th, Japanese troops in Yangzhou successively moved to Xishan, totaling more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops, and another 70 to 80 cavalry. On the 9th, they moved to Tianchang and Liuhe to strengthen defenses. Japanese troops in Xiannvmiao recently inspected the mail and detained and burned most of the mail sent from the post office to the un-occupied areas of the Chinese side.

### Situation in Northern Jiangsu Eases, Recapture of Siyang Reported

Part of the Puppet Army in Nantong Defects

Taixian Correspondence: Japanese troops in northern Jiangsu have repeatedly attempted to invade Huaiyin but have been bravely resisted and repelled by the Chinese army. In recent days, Japanese troops have again attempted to invade the south, repeatedly bombing Huaiyin. The long-distance telephone line between Qinghe and Taizhou was also damaged, and the situation suddenly became tense. One day, after a brave counterattack by a certain unit of the Chinese army, it was said that Siyang had been recaptured by the Chinese army. The long-distance telephone line between Qinghe and Taizhou has also been repaired and can resume normal communication, so the situation has eased again.

The guerrillas in northern Jiangsu have been reorganized by Gu Zhutong, and regular army units have been transferred to participate, and their momentum is growing. A few days ago, 300 puppet troops were causing disturbances in the countryside of Nantong. The people of various villages, fearing their power, fled to take refuge. When the puppet troops arrived at Jinsha Town, they were unexpectedly attacked by Chinese guerrillas. Troops from nearby towns also reportedly went to support the attack. The puppet troops were outnumbered and abandoned their guns and fled. Those who failed to escape from the town were captured, and a portion of the puppet troops defected and surrendered, shouting slogans such as "Long live the Republic of China."

### The Devastated Jiangnan and Jiangbei: Many Cultural Relics in Jiangnan Have Been Reduced to Ashes, Northern Jiangsu Still Has a Clean Land

The suffering of the Jiangnan area of Jiangsu Province after its fall has been seen in various newspapers. The reporter will now record the recent situation in various counties as follows:

Changshu Scenery

In Changshu, Jiangnan, the people are very wealthy. It is not uncommon for ordinary families to have assets of 30,000 to 100,000 yuan. Therefore, all the houses that were damaged by the war in the urban area have been gradually repaired. Factories and shops have also resumed business one after another, with the cloth factories being the most prosperous. This abnormal development is due to their purchase of large quantities of foreign yarn in Shanghai, which they transport to Qincheng by car. Under the control of the Japanese army, they recruit workers to dye and weave, and then transport them to Shanghai for sale. There are dozens of such factories in the urban area of Changshu. Although the interest is good, the transportation of goods by car from Shanghai to Changshu is sometimes attacked by guerrillas, which makes these merchants who intend to make a fortune from the national crisis somewhat fearful. Otherwise, Changshu's factories will occupy the top spot in Jiangnan. At the same time, the "special goods" business in Changshu is also developing abnormally due to the unimpeded flow.

Jiangyin Status

Jiangyin is located 100 li northwest of Changshu, bordering the Yangtze River. The city is fortified and the people are simple. The primary rural sideline is cloth making. The goods are now transported to Shanghai, mostly sold to Ningbo and Shaoxing, and as far as the Nanyang Islands. Those transported to Jiangbei are sold to Tongzhou and Yangzhou, as well as Dongtai, Yancheng, and Xinghua. Cotton is produced in the Dongxiang Shazhou area. In previous years, the price was about 12 yuan per package. Although the harvest was poor this year, the price of cotton is twice that of previous years. Moreover, because there is no obstruction to the cultivation, the people's lives are not in panic. The western countryside lacks rural sidelines and relies only on agricultural products and small businesses for a living. Therefore, financial flow is slower than in the eastern countryside, and people's lives are also more difficult. Education and other undertakings are not as developed as in the eastern countryside. At present, the urban area of Jiangyin has become a dead city. In addition to some merchants who are officials in the puppet organization, the rest are effectively hiding in the city.

Changzhou and Wuxi After the Disaster

Suzhou and Wuxi counties have always been known as areas with developed industry and commerce. On average, people's lives are better than in other places. In Wuxi, except for some people who set up shops in the urban and rural areas to engage in small businesses, most of the people in the rural areas who have some farmland are living in seclusion and eating their savings. In the Wujin area, the guerrillas in the northwest countryside have been organized for a long time and are in order. There are also many people who sell cattle, sheep, and livestock. In the southern countryside, such as the area east of Lake Gehu, rice production is famous. Japanese troops are stationed in the urban area of Yixing, and the Chinese army uses the mountains as a stronghold, with strict defenses. Many merchants in Chengjiang, Wuxi, and Wujin venture to the area to collect and sell rice, because the interest is higher. Therefore, since last year, the traffic has been constant. They concentrate their exports, mostly in Donglai Town, Dongxiang, Jiangyin, and transport them to Shanghai. Gaochun relies on the danger of Lake Shijiu in the north and Lake Gucheng in the south. A large Chinese army is gathered, waiting for an opportunity to attack.

Yangzhou in Stalemate

Yangzhou fell on December 15, 1937. Patriotic people rose up one after another, and the fighting has been deadlocked in the Zhaoguan Dam and Xiannvmiao area. In such an environment, the people have successively infiltrated various places to engage in organization, and the various organizations related to the puppet side in the city have gradually faded away and disappeared invisibly. By the end of February 1938, there was a fierce battle near the bridge. The two sides are still in a stalemate.

Recent Situation in Tongzhou and Rugao

Tongzhou fell on March 17, 1938, and Rugao continued to fall on the 19th. The Japanese army's attack on Nantong did not involve a particularly fierce battle, so the slaughter and burning were less than in other counties in Jiangnan. Due to the fall of Nantong, the neighboring counties were alarmed. In order to prevent themselves from encountering the same situation, the people of northern Jiangsu became more aroused. This resulted in the Japanese army, which had already invaded Nantong, Rugao and other places, only being able to occupy one urban area and unable to develop further.

Jingjiang Situation

Jingjiang fell, and the puppet magistrate of the county, Yuan Luchen, due to the threat of the Chinese army from three sides, and the Japanese army's defense was not very solid, and the city was small and low, in order to protect himself, recruited more than 100 bandits and filled the ranks of the puppet army. Jingjiang City is 18 li from Bajiang Port on the river, all of which are cobblestone roads. There are several to dozens of Japanese troops stationed at Bajiang Port, inspecting travelers. At present, small skirmishes of guerrillas occur from time to time in the Jiangbei Huangqiao, Jijiashi, and Guanglingzhen areas. The source of the Japanese troops is Jingjiang.

Taixian is Crowded

The refugees who have been repeatedly displaced have mostly gathered in Taixian. According to statistics at the end of February 1939, in addition to the refugees who have been repatriated, there are still more than 9,000 people living in the refugee camps. Therefore, the population of Taixian suddenly increased by more than 30,000 people during this period. The accents heard on the streets are mostly from Jiangnan, such as Wujin, Jiangyin, and Wuxi counties. There are also many from Danyang, Zhenjiang, and Changshu. In the 1,000 li water village north of Taixian and south of Xinghua, there are many homeless people.

People's Livelihood in Northern Jiangsu

As for the people's livelihood in northern Jiangsu, it is very simple. Except for a few people in the towns who specialize in commerce, most of them rely on coolie labor and agriculture for a living. Some of the people in the counties near the river work as coolies in the Jiangnan counties, some rely on small boats to travel to various places to do small business, and some grow crops at home. Their agricultural products include reeds from the mud flats, radishes, soybeans, and yellow beans. Rice and wheat are second. Their daily food, such as millet and yellow radishes, is quite simple. In the 1,000 li water village north of Taixian and south of Xinghua, most families raise ducks, because they are easier to raise. The duck eggs sold in Shanghai are mostly transported from there. In March and April of last year, due to the closure of Tiangong Port, eggs could not be transported out. The Lower River area produces a lot of rice. After the battle in Xiannvmiao, Yangzhou, the rice market has invisibly shifted to Datong. Because of the abundance of agricultural products in the Lower River area, people's lives are better than in other places. Because of the good life, people's thoughts tend to be stable. From Yancheng to Dongtai, there are many salt workers. Because the rainfall is relatively sparse, and the water in the Yuehe River contains a lot of alkali, which is bitter and difficult to drink, the wealthier households place large vats under the eaves to collect rainwater for drinking. This is a general description of the people's livelihood in Jiangbei.

### Pan American Giant Aircraft Arrives in Hong Kong, Will Officially Open Soon

Can Accommodate 72 People with Restaurant, Bedroom, and Other Facilities

Hong Kong Correspondence: The new Boeing 74 passenger giant aircraft of Pan American Airlines has arrived in Hong Kong on a trial flight from the United States. Despite the wind resistance in Kandia, it arrived safely in Hong Kong on the 3rd after departing from the Philippines. At one time, the officers, gentry, Chinese and Western ladies and gentlemen of Hong Kong went to visit. It is verified that this arrival of the aircraft in Hong Kong has added a valuable page to the history of Pacific aviation. Its beauty and comfort, the magnificent decoration and the unprecedented size of the aircraft, are all considered to be era-making works. The arrival of the aircraft in Hong Kong and its facilities are recorded as follows:

Slow Descent

The type aircraft took off from Little Luzon at 7:39 a.m. on the 3rd. When it was about to arrive in Hong Kong, it suddenly encountered thick fog, which was inconvenient for travel. It was forced to retreat. After slightly clearing the sky, it continued to fly and arrived in Hong Kong airspace at about 1 p.m. At this time, the airport clock rang loudly, and the spectators waiting on the coast of Kai Tak knew that the plane had arrived. Looking into the distance, this aerial monster had appeared on the low air above the sea. It was shaped like a fish, and then flew west along the coast, circling Hong Kong Island for a week, and then landed. At this time, it was 2:10 p.m. After the plane docked at the sea, the personnel on the plane landed in an orderly manner. Chinese and foreign photographers scrambled to take pictures, and the audience frequently congratulated the captain. The surroundings were filled with joyful air.

Captain Talks

The reporter interviewed Captain Qiao Fu at the Kai Tak Pier. According to the interview, the weather was quite good along the way, but it encountered fog when it was approaching Hong Kong. The average speed was 160 miles per hour, and the altitude was about 8,000 feet. When it was approaching Hong Kong, it turned back due to fog and then continued to fly to Hong Kong. It took off from Manila at 7:30 a.m. If it had not encountered fog, it would have arrived in Hong Kong at 11:30 a.m. It is verified that the aircraft did not carry passengers on this trip. In addition to the crew, there were 24 technicians. The aircraft is scheduled to return to the United States the next day, and will officially open to Hong Kong on the 23rd.

Interior Furnishings

The aircraft has two decks and 18 rooms, covered with luxurious carpets. The four sides have sofas and chairs against the walls, and the luxurious equipment is just like the residence of a wealthy man on Park Avenue in New York. Install two wings and fly in the air. Walking along the escalator into the Boeing plane, you first step onto the deck. The deck was originally for guests to get on and off, but the deck below is an oil storage pool, storing 1,500 gallons of oil. Open the horizontal door, and three steps down is the restaurant, with an area of 10 and a half feet wide and 12 feet long. All the furniture and utensils have colored patterns. The walls are silver-colored and equipped with "living block" curtains. There are five dining tables, and 14 people can dine at the same time. If the restaurant is not used for dining, it can be used as a meeting and entertainment. At the same time, if the aircraft does not take long-distance flights and changes to short-distance flights, the living room can be converted into a bedroom when there are more passengers. At this time, the whole aircraft can accommodate 40 passengers. There are two lanes in front and behind the restaurant, leading to the bedroom. There are three bedrooms, with a volume of 7 and a half feet wide, 12 feet long, and 7 feet high. The room is equipped with soundproof panels, so there is no need to worry about aircraft noise. The front and rear bedrooms can accommodate 10 guests. Each berth has its own electric light for reading, a ventilator, an electric bell clothes rack, etc., and they are all close to the windows that can look outside. On the left side of the stern is a four-person bedroom, next to the ladies' dressing room. There is a washbasin on the left of the door, a large mirror, hot and cold water taps, and a table for toothbrushes. There are two rows of dressing tables leaning against the outside. Going back to the last part of the passenger department, you can reach the most famous "honeymoon room".

### Foreign Reporters' Description of the Japanese Army's Plight

Anti-War Thought Spreads, Internal Turmoil and Unease

According to the New York, USA, communication, the February issue of The Commentator here recently published an article written by Mr. Hauser entitled (The Day the Daydream Awoke), which describes the author's personal observations of the plight of Japanese soldiers in Japan and the phenomenon of spreading anti-war thought and internal turmoil. It first mentions a wounded soldier who was sent back to China from the front. Because the soldier had broken his legs and arms, he was placed in a bass bucket. The soldier sought death but failed, so he bit his tongue and committed suicide. The Japanese newspapers absolutely prohibited the publication of this news, but almost everyone in the country, from Hokkaido to Kagoshima, knew about this. Secondly, it describes the tragic situation of Japanese soldiers going on expeditions and the control of war news in the country. What the general public sees in the newspapers every day are reports such as □□部队, 在□□少尉之下, 于口晚口晨之前, 由阵地前进, 至口口占领有城 之城, 使敌受重大损失, 我无死伤之类电讯, and no one knows what □□ represents. Once, a soldier on the front line in China wrote to his relatives and friends about the situation on the battlefield and the suffering of food shortages, which was confiscated by the authorities, resulting in what is called "front-line mail" that cannot reach the recipients. There is also the strange thing about the so-called condolence bag. The military department, in order to encourage the soldiers on the front line, sent whiskey, cigarettes, soap, toothbrushes, books and other items to the front line for condolences. In the condolence bag, there were anonymous letters of anti-revolutionary revolution, advising the soldiers to stop fighting and return home to support their wives and children. This was done by college students. Because it was discovered by the police, the condolence bag was also strictly prohibited. The reasons for the mutiny of the Japanese army on the Yangtze River front line in China are roughly as follows: the Japanese army is insufficient in strength, and the wounded soldiers have not recovered, and they are reopened on the front line. Therefore, the wounds have not healed, and the medical officers are repeatedly pressing them to return to the front line. In the Yangtze River area, the Japanese army suffered particularly heavy losses. This situation can be seen everywhere. Thirdly, it describes the illegal acts of the Japanese army in the occupied areas, such as rape, burning, killing, looting, torture, etc., and the strong resistance of the villagers in the occupied counties of China, and the situation of conscription rebellion. He also describes the disheveled and embarrassed situation of the Japanese soldiers who returned to Japan in Shimonoseki and Osaka, and the uneasy state of mind. He predicted that the Japanese would be exhausted, and under the high tide of the warlords, a great revolution would inevitably break out in the near future. When the author was in Tokyo, he visited the largest army hospital, so the situation described is very true.

### Promoting Forestry in Jiangxi Province

Nanchang Correspondence: Forests are crucial to the nation and an indispensable factor for national defense. Jiangxi's forestry has always been well-developed. Since the war of resistance, attention has been paid to practical uses such as national defense, military use, and transportation. Vigorous efforts have been made to promote seedling cultivation and protection. Nurseries and demonstration forests have been established in southern and western Jiangxi to carry out forestry promotion by district, aiming for universal development throughout the province. The indexes for tree planting, promotion, and seedling cultivation in various nurseries and forest farms in the past four years are as follows: A. Tree planting: 1,130,540 trees in the 24th year of the Republic, 1,889,243 trees in the 25th year, 9,217,730 trees in the 26th year, and 1,076,500 trees in the 27th year. B. Promotion of forest seeds: 516 shi sheng in the 24th year, 6,267 shi sheng in the 26th year, and 3,075 shi sheng in the 27th year. C. Promotion of seedlings and forests: 2,232 trees in the 24th year, 4,465,350 trees in the 25th year, 18,096,653 trees in the 26th year, and 9,294,838 trees in the 27th year. In the 28th year, a total of 19,520,756 seedlings were cultivated. The province's future forestry development policies include: 1. In addition to managing state-owned forests, attention will be paid to local forestry, encouraging private afforestation, promoting cooperative afforestation, and promoting afforestation in rural areas, townships, and Baojia systems. 2. Conduct surveys of forests and wasteland, and then focus on cultivating firs, larches, and other species suitable for building aircraft materials, as well as military timber.

### Chinese Troops Recapture Sijing

Japanese Lieutenant Kawano Wounded

Songjiang Correspondence: After driving the Japanese troops from Zhangyan and other places, the loyal and patriotic National Salvation Army of the Chinese side, led by Ding Xishan, led his troops to the Dama Mountain and Xiaokun Mountain area, where they joined forces with the guerrillas and attacked Songjiang. When they reached the vicinity of Chenjing Bridge, they engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese garrison Kawano unit in Sijing for about two hours. The Japanese army was completely defeated and in a terrible state, with heavy casualties along the way. Lieutenant Kawano was hit by several bullets and was carried away by Japanese soldiers. Taking advantage of the victory, Ding's troops recaptured Sijing and are now preparing to attack Songjiang as a group. At the same time, the Japanese Nakajima unit in Nanqiao has been repeatedly attacked by the mobile unit of Chuan Shengchang, which is active in the Qianjiaqiao area, and is extremely panicked. In addition, Nanqiao has no defenses, so it has withdrawn to the outskirts of Shanghai.

### Second Anti-Japanese Propaganda Week: Education Sector Propaganda Day Today

Educational Organizations Issue Declarations to Strive for the Three Principles of the People Education

Today is the fourth day of the Anti-Japanese Propaganda Week held by the Shanghai Special City Party Department leading all sectors of society. Educational organizations in the city have issued a declaration and sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, expressing their support for the Chairman's instructions at the National Education Conference. The following is a verbatim record:

Declaration of the Education Sector: Today is the Education Sector Propaganda Day of the first week of the second phase of the Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai. We feel that the task of the Anti-Japanese War in the later stage is even more arduous than in the previous stage, because education is a sharp weapon for resisting Japan and building the country. To resist Japan and build the country, the people must have a clear awareness, a firm determination, unified action, and lasting strength. All of this comes from education. At this time when the Anti-Japanese War is entering its second phase, the responsibilities that our Shanghai education sector should fulfill are even greater. We must base ourselves on the principles of the Three Principles of the People education, support Chairman Chiang's instructions at the Third National Education Conference, and support the declaration of the National Education Conference, so as to conduct an in-depth review of education in Shanghai in the future, study ways to improve and strengthen it, and adapt it to the needs of resisting Japan and building the country.

(1) Absolutely adhere to the educational purpose of the Three Principles of the People. Chairman Chiang instructed us at the National Education Conference, saying, "The revolutionary Three Principles of the People should be the highest standard for our country's education, and the program for resisting Japan and building the country should be implemented. The new vitality of modern countries is composed of three elements: education, economy, and military force. Education is the foundation of all undertakings." We educators should deeply understand and sincerely abide by this guidance and enlightenment from the highest leader. The education sector in Shanghai unanimously takes the Three Principles of the People as a common belief. We should make the will of all students in the city as strong as steel, and the spirit of all young people as fiery as flames. Through the power of education, we should promote and encourage the revolutionary spirit of the people in the city, and increase the revolutionary enthusiasm for loving the motherland, so as to win the final victory of our nation and country.

(2) Absolutely support the declaration of the National Education Conference. The Third National Education Conference was held in Chongqing, the seat of the National Government, during this period of incursion by the enemy, and a declaration was issued to raise academic standards and meet the needs of resisting Japan and building the country. Based on the enlightenment of the Premier and the supreme leader, detailed and specific instructions were given on various aspects of higher education, secondary education, elementary education, normal education, and social education, in order to meet the needs of resisting Japan. After seeing the progress of this conference, we should work harder and actively forge ahead. In addition to adhering to the Three Principles of the People as the highest principle of education, we must absolutely support the declaration and resolutions of this National Education Conference. We must know that the success of resisting Japan and building the country depends on the efforts of our education sector, and we must not hesitate to make sacrifices.

(3) Absolutely support the leader's instructions at the National Education Conference. Chairman Chiang personally delivered instructions at the Third National Education Conference, explaining that the meeting was being held during a period of active resistance against Japan and national reconstruction. The mission and task of the meeting were to review the current situation in the education sector, study ways to improve or remedy it, solve the current difficult problems in education, and elaborate that the development of the economy and the enhancement of military power are based on education as the general hub, using the spirit of frugality and hard work to expand the effect of education, strengthen the will to resist Japan and build the country, and establish our spirit of actively building the country. It is necessary to create all students to have the awareness and ability to defend the country, defend themselves, govern themselves, and govern the country, so that education and military administration are integrated under the Three Principles of the People, united in one heart and one mind, and work hard for the Chinese revolution. We sincerely support the leader's instructions, and the national education sector should work together to promote the Three Principles of the People education, strengthen the national spirit and will to resist Japan, and strive for the final victory.

Finally, all of us in the education sector in the city should solemnly pledge today to strive to the end for the education of the Three Principles of the People.

### Overview of Border Education Conducted by Various Ministries and Commissions

Subsidizing School Funds in Border Areas and Establishing Middle Schools in Xining, Suzhou, Yunnan, and Guizhou

(Chongqing Correspondence) Border education was already roughly established before the war. The relocation of educational and cultural institutions to the interior after the war is the best opportunity to promote the development of border education. The following is a brief description of the border education conducted by various ministries and commissions over the years:

Ministry of Education: In order to actively promote border education, the Ministry of Education coordinated the work of various related agencies, formulated an overall implementation plan, convened a discussion on border education issues, and adopted the "Plan for Promoting Education in Border Provinces." The plan is divided into nine chapters: Chapter 1: Guiding Principles and Operating Principles; Chapter 2: Training and Further Education of Teachers; Chapter 3: Compilation of Teaching Materials; Chapter 4: Elementary Education; Chapter 5: Secondary Education; Chapter 6: Higher Education; Chapter 7: Social Education; Chapter 8: Encouraging Learning and Regional Supervision System; Chapter 9: Estimation of Funding. The entire plan contains concrete measures for border education facilities. In the future, the promotion of border education will adopt a system of simultaneous advancement by the central and local governments. Starting from the 28th year, a number of national normal schools, vocational schools, middle schools, and border experimental elementary schools will be established as centers for promotion. In addition, measures for treating Mongolian and Tibetan students and issuing subsidies have been revised separately. The Ministry of Education also believes that "Border Production Education" urgently needs to be emphasized, that "Communicating Chinese and Tibetan Culture" should be planned, and that "Organizing Border Inspection Groups to Engage in the Investigation and Research of Practical Border Issues" should be discussed and implemented with various experts. The entire border education should be considered as a whole. A border education committee has been organized to discuss and handle matters at any time. The Ministry of Education has established a Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Department. Over the years, it has subsidized school funds in border areas annually and subsidized Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui students to study in specialized schools and above in the interior, and has compiled various bilingual textbooks in Chinese, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui for teaching purposes.

Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission: In addition to jointly discussing border education plans and allocating Mongolian education funds with the Ministry of Education over the years, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission also runs the Beijing Mongolian and Tibetan School and the Mongolian and Tibetan Political Training Class.

Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee: The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board of Trustees established a science museum in Suzhou and runs middle schools in Xining, Suzhou, Yunnan, and Guizhou to help the development of border education.

In addition, the Central Political School has an affiliated Mongolian and Tibetan School and has established branch schools in various places. The Central Organization Department has also established border vocational schools to seek the implementation of production education.

### Standing Committee Meeting of the Education Group Fundraising Association

Set a Deadline for Ending Fundraising Procedures and Organize a Production Education Committee

The Standing Committee of the Fundraising Committee of the Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road. Yao Huiquan, Du Zuowen, Chen Jicheng, Xi Yushu, Chen Heqin, Wang Dagang, Zhao Chuanjia, Zhang Lingfei, Xu Renguang, Feng Shuhua, Feng Yixian, Jin Tongyin, Zhang Rongzhen, Chai Zifei, Lin Buji, Liu Chongben, Xu Peihang, Xue Zheng, Wu Zhiqian, Gu Yinqian, Ni Fengmei, Huang Zhongsu, Chen Xuanshan, Zhang Zhonghuan, Zhong Yiming, Yin Yiwen, Tao Guangchuan, Qian Weizong, Meng Jiancheng, Yu Chuanding, Cui Jianwu, Zhou Zefu, Shi Jiuyun, Gu Huiren, Sun Xiaolou, Ge Youren, Liang Zhongyuan, and others attended, presided over by Xi Yushu. Chairman Xi reported that the association's campaign to raise funds for refugee production education and promote the Charity Medal fundraising campaign began on the first of this month and will last until the tenth. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of all sectors, the association has achieved its set goals, which is very gratifying. The Shen Bao newspaper donated all the Charity Medals, worth more than 2,000 yuan. From the beginning of the preparations to the present, the personnel have been assisted voluntarily by colleagues from the Chinese Education Department of the Public Concession, the Shanghai Private Middle School, and the Public Trust Accounting Firm. The Shanghai Bank's head office and branches have helped to issue badges and collect donations, which is extremely laborious. All of these are deeply admirable. All necessary administrative expenses and the purchase of prizes have also been generously donated by major bookstores such as the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Bookstore. Therefore, the association has not used a single cent of the Charity Medal donations. Although the association's fundraising campaign has come to an end, the education and cultural sectors will continue to promote thrift and disaster relief work as a social example. The following motions were then discussed: (1) According to Item 3 of the association's reward method, the schools with the top five Charity Medal numbers will receive a plaque from the association's chairman in addition to the association's Charity Certificate. According to Item 4, the schools with the Charity Medal numbers ranking from sixth to tenth will receive a silver shield from the association's chairman in addition to the association's Charity Certificate. Because there are many schools with excellent fundraising results, it is proposed to expand the scope of rewards without limiting the number of places. It was resolved that all schools that raise more than 1,000 yuan will be awarded a plaque from the association's chairman, and those who raise more than 1,000 yuan will be awarded a silver shield from the chairman. (2) Regarding the proposal to set a deadline for ending fundraising procedures, it was resolved that fundraising and medal donations will be cut off uniformly on the 16th of this month (Thursday), and all schools should submit their donations by the 18th of this month (Saturday). (3) Regarding the proposal to organize a production education committee, it was resolved that Chen Heqin, Sun Xiaolou, and Yao Huiquan will be appointed as members to draft the organization and planning outline. (4) Regarding the proposal to review the association's donations, it was resolved that after all fundraising procedures have been completed, Wang Sifang, Wang Haifan, Bei Zuyi, and Shen Xuejun, standing members of the Accountants Association, and Xu Yinghao, a supervisory committee member, will be invited to review and announce the results. (5) It is the greatest joy to do good deeds. Now that the fundraising campaign is over, it is proposed to issue a closing declaration. It was resolved that Committee Member Chen Xuanshan will draft the declaration.

### Public Announcement by the Municipal Council Regarding Numerous Rumors: Content of Agreements Released Yesterday; Exercise of Authority Based on Land Regulations, Actual Searches Conducted by the Police Department

Rumors of Japanese Military Police Establishing Offices in Police Stations are Baseless. The Municipal Council Information Office announced: Recent reports in the press regarding the agreements reached between the Council's Police Department and the Japanese Military Police have contained inaccuracies. In light of this, the Council believes it is appropriate to publicly disclose a summary of the negotiations.

Established Policy: Regarding acts of terror and violence occurring within the International Settlement, the Japanese authorities engaged in negotiations with the Council between February 22nd and March 3rd. The Council's position is outlined below: (1) Regarding anti-Japanese terrorist incidents, the Council has implemented the emergency measures announced on July 19, 1938, and is prepared to continue to do so. (2) Any proposal for a police agency other than the Council's Police Department to act independently within the International Settlement is unacceptable to the Council. The Council's police powers and responsibilities under the Land Regulations cannot be transferred to others without the approval of the relevant countries. However, the Council stated that it is prepared to continue to welcome cooperation from the Japanese Military Police and consular police in investigating terrorist activities. Any cooperation must be implemented with the consent of the Council's Police Commissioner and after consultation with him. (3) Prior to the commencement of these negotiations, the Council, in fulfilling its responsibility to prevent acts of violence, had already implemented searches of people entering the International Settlement by waterway. The Council is prepared to intensify these measures, and is also prepared to continue inviting Japanese plainclothes inspectors to be present during searches. (4) During this municipal year, the Council has newly recruited 45 police officers for the Japanese division of the Police Department. The Council has sought to recruit an additional 33 personnel from Japan to fill the quota stipulated in the budget. This has also been explained by the Council. (5) The Council stated that searches of important locations within the International Settlement are a normal and continuous function of the Council's Police Department. This work is currently being intensified.

Cooperation Methods: The Council's Police Commissioner held talks with Japanese officials to formulate detailed methods for implementing the aforementioned cooperation. The following points were decided during the talks: (1) Regarding the search of people entering the International Settlement by waterway, the Council's Police Department welcomes the cooperation of the Japanese Military Police and consular police, but the actual searches must be carried out by the Council's Police Department. (2) If the Japanese authorities receive information regarding the location of terrorists within the Settlement and provide concrete reasons, and the Council's Police Department believes that the reasons given are sufficient to justify restricting traffic in a certain area in order to conduct a search, then the Council's Police Department is prepared to cooperate in this way. (3) The Japanese side suggested establishing a mixed group within the existing Criminal Division organization, consisting of a senior Japanese police officer and several selected Japanese staff. The Council's Police Commissioner is prepared to give sympathetic consideration to this proposal. The proposed group must be integrated with the existing overall organization of the Police Department and become part of the Detective Division of Police Headquarters, under the command of the head of that division. The function of this group is to enable the Japanese authorities to have rapid liaison when necessary in the work of suppressing terrorists. (4) If a person is arrested for a terrorist incident based on information provided by the Japanese authorities, the Council's Police Department is prepared to generally provide facilities for interrogation if the Japanese side wishes to do so, but the Police Department reserves the right to handle each case individually. All difficult cases will be discussed by the two police agencies.

Certain newspapers have stated that the Japanese Military Police will establish offices in the various police stations of the Council's Police Department, or that Japanese Military Police will be stationed in the various police stations of the Council's Police Department. These reports are without foundation. In addition, there is another report stating that the Police Commissioner has agreed to place Chinese police officers under the supervision of the Japanese Military Police, which is also completely unfounded.

### Japanese Authorities Arbitrarily Arrest Chinese: Political Kidnappings; Police Department Completely Unaware in Advance, Japanese Personnel Absolutely Not Allowed to Act Freely

The Continental Times reports that yesterday evening (the 11th), the Japanese side hosted reporters from various newspapers, and the embassy spokesperson, in answering questions, refused to comment on whether plainclothes Japanese military police had applied to the Municipal Council or obtained permission from the Council to take independent action in the International Settlement. It is rumored that since the 7th of this month, the Municipal Council's Police Department has arrested eight Chinese and handed them over to the Japanese authorities. Yesterday, the police authorities denied this, stating that there have been no incidents of this nature this year. However, the Police Department is aware of the illegal actions of plainclothes Japanese individuals who have kidnapped several Chinese in various locations within the International Settlement. It is understood that the number reaches eight or nine people, and it is generally believed that these are political kidnappings. It is reported that the Japanese side took this action without the permission or consent of the International Settlement Police Department, as the Police Department was completely unaware in advance and only learned of the kidnappings after they occurred. It is also rumored that the Police Department and the Japanese authorities recently reached an agreement stipulating that personnel appointed by the Japanese side may act freely. A police officer firmly denied this, stating that the Japanese military police have more freedom of action on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek because an agreement on different work arrangements has not yet been reached. The Municipal Council's Police Department only has the power to arrest people on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, so plainclothes Japanese individuals arresting people on the south bank would violate any agreement reached between the Japanese side and the Police Department after the Chinese army moved west.

### Chen Guangfu

Rumors of Succession as President of the Bank of China Are Incorrect. Yesterday, there were rumors that Chen Guangfu would succeed as President of the Central Bank. Yesterday, this reporter specifically visited someone close to Mr. Chen, who stated that Mr. Chen has been ill recently and is currently resting during his trip to the United States. He is also on leave from his position as General Manager of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank. The rumor of him succeeding as President of the Central Bank is not true.

### Relief Association Discourages Refugees from Returning to Their Hometowns

Maximally Receiving and Introducing Employment; Party and Police Organs Resolutely Discourage. In view of the fact that refugees fleeing from war zones in various places have been residing for a long time and facing livelihood difficulties, and that many poor people intend to return to their hometowns to make a living, the National Government, in order to correct this erroneous thinking, has specifically instructed the Relief Committee to resolutely discourage this and to find ways to provide refugees with stability in their lives, so as to directly alleviate the suffering of refugees in occupied areas and indirectly promote the development of the war of resistance. It is now understood that after receiving the order, the Relief Committee has formulated four measures: (1) Each province and city will establish as many shelters as possible to receive refugees fleeing from war zones. (2) Provincial and municipal governments will handle registration and engage in employment referrals for refugees. (3) Party headquarters at all levels will expose the tragic situation in occupied areas so that the public is aware of it. (4) Military and police forces in various locations will resolutely discourage refugees from returning to their hometowns at various transportation hubs. Circulars have been sent to each province and city to be relayed and followed.

### Hong Kong: Prices of All Goods Soar

Pork at Thirty-Two Dollars per Picul; Chicken at Two Dollars and Twenty Cents per Catty

Since the fall of Guangzhou, the cost of living in Hong Kong has risen due to transportation disruptions, causing the prices of all goods to soar. However, since the Japanese army occupied Hainan Island, trade with Hong Kong has been greatly affected. The price of pork has risen from 24 Hong Kong dollars per picul to 32 dollars. The price of chicken and duck has also risen from 80 cents per catty to 2 dollars and 25 cents in Hong Kong currency.

### Municipal Council Promotes Traffic Safety

Safety Week to Be Held; Meeting Scheduled for the 21st

Due to the high number of traffic accidents in the International Settlement, the Traffic Department of the Municipal Council plans to hold a "Safety First" week in the near future to reduce accidents. It is hoped that various organizations concerned with this plan will provide assistance and cooperation. A meeting is scheduled for the 21st of this month at the Police Club on the eighth floor of the Central Police Station on Fourth Avenue, and representatives from various agencies are invited to attend.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Launches Tea Industry Loans

Totaling Ten Million Yuan; The Zhejiang Provincial Government considers that Zhejiang Province produces a very large amount of tea annually. Since unified control of sales was implemented last year, both production and sales have increased. Now that spring has arrived, it is the season for tea farmers and merchants to process tea leaves. In order to support and develop increased production, the government has borrowed ten million yuan from the Zhejiang Local Bank for tea industry loans. The Local Bank has already agreed to lend five million yuan, and the remainder will be allocated by other banks. The Zhejiang Provincial Government plans to allocate the funds to the Wartime Trade Association and the Tea Sales Office for lending.

### Interference in Flag Hanging Incident: City Party Headquarters Expresses Solemnly; Has Reported to Central Government for Negotiation

Regarding the interference by the French Concession authorities in the public's hanging of flags on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, which aroused public indignation and caused several disturbances, according to reports in the Continental Daily News and the English-language China Press, the French Concession authorities' interference in the hanging of flags was due to a notice issued to the public by the Shanghai City Party Headquarters, stating that flag hanging of a political nature would be interfered with. Regarding this matter, the Shanghai City Party Headquarters issued a statement yesterday, stating: Since the fall of Shanghai, the patriotism of the entire citizenry and their support for the national policy of resisting Japan have become even more pronounced. Every time there is a commemorative festival, the city is filled with national flags. This strong and unyielding spirit of the people is powerful evidence that our war of resistance will surely be victorious and our nation will surely be built. Before and after the westward movement of the National Army, the Party Headquarters has always issued instructions on commemorative methods for each commemorative festival so that the public can follow them uniformly, not only on this anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. The authorities' interference this time has aroused public indignation and caused several disturbances, which is deeply regrettable. According to the reports in the Continental Daily News and the English-language China Press, the reason why the authorities interfered with the public's hanging of flags was because it was of a political nature. This statement is very strange. It should be understood that the national flag is a symbol representing the nation, and is itself of a political nature. Interfering with a country's citizens hanging their national flag is tantamount to insulting that country. As for the so-called "pre-existing regulations," the citizens of Shanghai have never heard of them before. The true intention of the authorities in interfering with the hanging of flags is unknown. The Party Headquarters has telegraphed this matter to the Central Government and requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate.

### National Spiritual Mobilization: All Sectors Exert Themselves to Promote It; Pledge to Conscientiously Abide by National Covenant; Thrift Committee Earnestly Hopes Fellow Citizens Will Correct Their Lives

President Chiang, concurrently Chairman of the National Defense Supreme Council, recognizing the importance of National Spiritual Mobilization, previously formulated the Outline for National Spiritual Mobilization, which was presented to and passed by the Fifth Central Plenary Session and the Second National Political Council. On the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, President Chiang telegraphed the entire country to announce its implementation. All sectors in this city have expressed extreme support for the spirit of mobilization outline and implementation measures, and are currently gathering to discuss actively promoting it in order to achieve practical results, and will automatically pledge to abide by the National Covenant. The Thrift Movement Committee of this city also issued a letter to fellow citizens of the entire city yesterday. The details are recorded separately below. All Sectors Gather to Discuss Actively Promoting: After President Chiang telegraphed the entire country on the day of Sun Yat-sen's death to announce the implementation of National Spiritual Mobilization, all sectors in this city, after respectfully reading it, were extraordinarily excited. The Shanghai City Party Headquarters is currently drafting detailed implementation measures and will lead the citizens of the entire city to implement it consistently. At the same time, various organizations, agencies, trade associations, labor unions, etc., are also automatically gathering to discuss actively promoting measures, determined to uphold the supreme principles of nationalism and national supremacy, and to concentrate will, concentrate strength, and fight together with military first and victory first as the sole guiding principles. As for the education and youth sectors, they are organizing a National Spiritual Mobilization Coordination Association to be responsible for presiding over and executing the affairs.

Pledge to Abide by the National Covenant: Furthermore, according to a reporter from the Modern Society, after inquiring with various trade organizations, all sectors in this city have decided to automatically convene their members separately to hold oath-taking ceremonies for the twelve items of the National Covenant within the National Spiritual Mobilization. Other schools, shops, and households will all be convened by their respective principals, shop owners, and parents to hold oath-taking ceremonies. The text of the Covenant and the oath are recorded below: "Covenant": 1. Not to violate the Three Principles of the People; 2. Not to violate government laws and regulations; 3. Not to violate the interests of the nation and the people; 4. Not to be a traitor or a submissive subject of the enemy country; 5. Not to participate in traitor organizations; 6. Not to be an officer or soldier of the enemy army or traitors; 7. Not to guide the enemy or traitors; 8. Not to gather information for the enemy or traitors; 9. Not to work for the enemy or traitors; 10. Not to use banknotes from enemy or traitor banks; 11. Not to buy enemy goods; 12. Not to sell food or any items to the enemy or traitors. "Oath": We all take our conscience, swear to abide by the National Covenant, absolutely support the leadership of President Chiang, do our best to serve the country, and if there is any breach of the oath, we are willing to accept the punishment of the government. Respectfully sworn.

Thrift Committee's Letter to Fellow Citizens: Regarding President Chiang's announcement of the implementation of National Spiritual Mobilization, the Thrift Movement Committee of this city issued a letter to fellow citizens of the entire city yesterday, stating: President Chiang, in order to invigorate the national spirit, personally drafted the Outline and Measures for National Spiritual Mobilization, and on the day of Sun Yat-sen's death, telegraphed the entire country to announce its implementation. This committee dares to earnestly address fellow citizens of the entire city once again on the point of correcting lives and practicing thrift. Our country's war of resistance against Japan has entered the second stage. Although the date of final victory is not far off, there are many things that require our greatest efforts. At a time when the flames of the enemy have not been extinguished and the mountains and rivers are broken, it is a time for the entire nation to lie on firewood and taste gall, endure hardship, and temper themselves. However, people in isolated islands, due to the influence of the adverse environment, are mostly accustomed to extravagant and decadent lives, which has a profound and significant impact on the future of the war of resistance. In the past year, through the loud appeals of enthusiastic people from all sectors, advocating thrift and disaster relief, although there has been good progress on the surface, it is still far from what we hope for in reality. If we look at the thrift practices of the aggressor countries, members of the royal family do not add new clothes, government officials do not ride in cars, police and students do not wear leather shoes, and all other aspects of life enjoyment are subject to strict restrictions. Even the lions and tigers in the zoo eat fish instead of meat. Although it is said that the enemy country's economy has shown signs of collapse, the spirit of hard work and endurance of its people is indeed worthy of our emulation. Now, at the time of National Spiritual Mobilization, this committee earnestly hopes that fellow citizens of the entire city will fulfill the following items: (1) Rectify daily life and stop all improper entertainment; (2) Prohibit extravagance, waste, and all meaningless squandering; (3) Purchase domestic goods as much as possible and limit the consumption of imported goods; (4) Reduce life enjoyment, strictly implement universal austerity, and contribute the proceeds of thrift to the government, thereby enriching the strength of the war of resistance and striving for final victory. Fellow citizens of the entire city, the bandits have not been eliminated, and the national disaster is serious. Why not rise up quickly and avoid being devoured by the tiger? May we encourage each other to strive together!

### Chinese Courts in the French Concession: Agreement Extended Indefinitely; Explicit Stipulation in Exchange of Notes Between Foreign Minister Luo and French Ambassador to China

Special Court No. 1 Agreement Also Extended as Usual; The establishment of courts at all levels by the National Government of the Republic of China in the French Concession of Shanghai is based on an agreement signed by the Chinese and French governments in Nanjing on July 28, 1931. The agreement was effective from July 31 of that year to April 1, 1933. At the expiration date, both parties agreed to extend it for three years. The extension period was extended again after it expired. Recently, there have been rumors that the term of the extended extension will expire at the end of this month. A reporter from the Shanghai Guangshe Newspaper obtained reliable information from judicial circles yesterday that after the Chinese and French governments signed the agreement on July 28, 1933, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan of the National Government and French Ambassador to China Mr. Wei exchanged notes in March 1933 regarding the agreement, and there was no objection to the agreement, and it should be extended indefinitely. According to the note, the agreement is still extended indefinitely, and the rumors from outside are purely fabricated. As for Special Court No. 1, based on the precedents of repeated extensions on April 1, 1933, and April 1, 1936, it will of course be extended again for three years from April 1 this year.

### Japanese Side Still Unwilling to Open the Yangtze River

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily News on the 14th, the Japanese Navy spokesperson stated at a press conference yesterday that the blockade of the Yangtze River is related to "military needs." Once these "needs" cease to exist, navigation on the Yangtze River can be opened. When a foreign reporter asked when these "needs" might cease, the spokesperson replied that this period could not be predicted. However, among the so-called "needs," a distinction should be made between the "needs" of the army and the "needs" of the navy. As far as the navy is concerned, if the situation permits, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River may be opened in part for international navigation.

### Puppet Municipal Government: Indiscriminate Exactions

Also Launches "Business Registration"; "Protection" Only Available After Paying Fees

The puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government," due to the unusually active guerrilla forces of the Chinese army in the suburbs, has recruited several hundred puppet police officers to strengthen security. However, the expenses for this are insufficient, so it has to find other ways to make up the shortfall. The puppet "Social Affairs Bureau" has established so-called "Provisional Rules for Business Registration," consisting of 34 articles, stipulating that all businesses must register with the puppet "Police Bureau." Those with capital of 1,000 yuan pay a fee of one yuan, those with up to 10,000 yuan pay two yuan, those with up to 100,000 yuan pay five yuan, and those with more than 100,000 yuan add five yuan for every 100,000 yuan. "Protection" is only available after registering and paying the fee. Therefore, all industries in the occupied areas are suffering oppression and resentment.

### Yanglinkou: Attack on Japanese Warship

Over Ten Thousand Sets of Military Uniforms Unloaded and Distributed for Use by Various Units; A Japanese No. 3 transport ship, carrying over ten thousand sets of military uniforms, departed from Shanghai and sailed to Yanglinkou. Because the water was shallow, it could not sail further and was anchored there. The night before last (the 12th), it was suddenly attacked by the guerrilla force of Cai Jinqi, who killed six Japanese soldiers and disarmed the rest. The over ten thousand sets of military uniforms were unloaded and distributed for use by various units. By the time a large Japanese force arrived, the unit had already left.

### Shanghai Rice Prices Gradually Stabilizing: Price Evaluation Committee Established Today; Suppressing Backdoor Deals, Investigating Speculative Manipulation, Vigorously Clearing Sources, Food Supply in Shanghai Not a Concern

After the Soybean and Rice Industry and seven other groups decided to organize a Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee, the committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting today at 2:00 PM. A resolution will be made to evaluate prices based on the previously agreed price limit. The Rice Market Management Committee has earnestly enforced the price limit, suppressed backdoor deals, and thoroughly investigated speculative manipulation. Since yesterday, market prices have gradually stabilized, and speculators have gradually disappeared. The details are recorded below.

Committee Meeting to Evaluate Rice Prices: The Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee, jointly formed by the Soybean and Rice, Rice Store, Rice Milling, and Rice Grain Dealers Associations, as well as the Rice Transport Merchants United Benefit Association, Changshu Guild Hall, and Nanbang Guild Hall, was notified yesterday by Fu Qian’geng, the convener designated by the Soybean and Rice Industry, that the first committee meeting will be held at the Shanghai Commercial Company on Hankou Road at 2:00 PM today to announce its establishment. It was also resolved to evaluate Shanghai rice prices based on the previously agreed price limit, that is, first-grade white rice must not exceed 14 yuan. The rice prices of the middle grade shall be valued accordingly. Subsequently, all passenger lines and firms must comply with this evaluated price; however, the commission for buying and selling may be added separately, at 12 cents per picul.

Suppressing Backdoor Deals and Investigating Manipulation: The Soybean and Rice Market Management Committee has earnestly enforced the 14-yuan price limit and suppressed illegal backdoor transactions, thoroughly investigating hoarding and speculative manipulation. If any violations of the above circumstances are discovered, a report will be submitted to the association for sanctions. At the same time, the Rice Transport Merchants United Benefit Association has advised rice merchants to make every effort to clear sources, to take the overall situation into account, to maintain the food supply, and to not stop selling due to rising rice prices in the production area. It is reported that various firms and merchants have agreed to cooperate with each other to maintain the Shanghai food supply and stabilize market prices.

Market Rice Prices Gradually Stabilizing: Since yesterday, due to the earnest enforcement of the price limit by various rice industry groups, speculators have gradually disappeared. Hoarders, fearing being discovered and punished, have sold part of their stocks at the limited price. As a result, market prices have gradually stabilized and backdoor deals have gradually decreased. As for the amount of goods arriving recently, it has increased compared to last week, at approximately 5,000 to 6,000 bags per day. It is estimated that the current stock in Shanghai is approximately 600,000 bags, which is sufficient for three months. Therefore, there is temporarily no concern about a shortage of the overall food supply. Even when the new crop is not yet available, the situation will not be too serious.

### Public Celebration Date Set for Ma Xiangbo's Centenary Birthday

Scheduled for April 6 at the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association; Since the fellow countrymen of Zhen, Dan, Jin, Li, and Yang counties began preparing for a public celebration of Mr. Ma Xiangbo's centenary birthday, participants from all sides have been very enthusiastic. Including He Dekui and hundreds of others, the association has now decided to hold the birthday celebration ceremony at the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association on April 6.

### Puppet "Ministry of Communications" Attempts to Print Puppet "Stamps" Fails

After the puppet "Reformed Government," under Japanese prompting, declared its "establishment" in Nanjing on March 28 of last year, all the clowns who donned official hats were scheming and plotting against each other, exhausting their ability to extort in order to fill their own pockets, causing the people's burden to increase and their suffering to be unbearable. Recently, the puppet "Ministry of Communications," in order to attempt to open up a path to wealth, planned to print puppet "stamps" itself. After several discussions, because the "puppet government" is a puppet organization and is not recognized by various countries, the Universal Postal Union has decided not to agree to the issuance of puppet "stamps." It is now understood that the puppet "Ministry of Communications" knows it cannot overcome the difficulties, and the plan to issue puppet "stamps" cannot be realized after all.

### The Serious State of the Shanghai Battlefield: "Pacification Troops" Retreat from West Shanghai, Chinese Forces Begin Encirclement in South Pudong

A mainland news report states that yesterday (the 13th), according to Chinese and Japanese sources, fierce fighting has been occurring in the Shanghai area for the past seven days, involving a considerable number of troops. This confirms earlier reports that guerrilla forces were stepping up their activities in most parts of Shanghai. The area closest to the city where fighting has taken place is Hongqiao. Regular Chinese troops, displaying strength and dispersed tactics, attacked Japanese forces stationed in the area from midnight until dawn yesterday, then withdrew in good order, without any losses.

Despite the Japanese military spokesman telling reporters last night that he had no knowledge of the fighting in Hongqiao and that he believed no fighting had occurred, inquiries among Hongqiao residents revealed that the sound of gunfire, which did not cease from midnight until 7:00 AM, was certainly not target practice. Yesterday afternoon, a Hongqiao resident told a reporter that both sides must have used machine guns, and he believed that hand grenades had also been used during the attack. This indicates that the two armies must have been very close to each other. According to Chinese sources, the attack was particularly focused on striking the "Great Way Pacification Army" which was close to Shanghai. This is a team of Han traitors sent from Nanjing to replace the Japanese garrison that was suffering from fatigue. Last night, a Japanese military spokesman reported on the fighting that had occurred in the past week, which further confirmed recent Chinese reports of active guerrilla forces in the Shanghai area. Although the detailed reports of casualties from the Chinese and Japanese sides differed, the large number of troops involved indicated that the fighting was undoubtedly serious. According to a Japanese military spokesman last night, Japanese forces and 1,000 Chinese irregular troops were engaged in a full day of intense fighting.

Fighting began on Friday when Japanese forces occupied Nanhui in Pudong. This was because 200 guerrillas active in the northeast of Nanhui began to move towards Nanhui at dawn on Friday. At that time, there were also 300 guerrillas in Nanhui. When the Japanese army lined up to attack, another 500 guerrillas set out from Datuan, about six kilometers south of Nanhui, to attack. After the Japanese army engaged them, they attacked Nanhui again and occupied it at 4:00 PM. The spokesman exaggerated the Japanese losses as one dead and three wounded. On Saturday morning, Japanese forces fought with a Chinese army team of about 200 people at Tanzhiqiao, 20 kilometers southeast of Nanhui. The spokesman said that there were no Japanese casualties. At 9:00 AM on Tuesday, Japanese forces clashed with about 300 guerrillas 10 kilometers south of Fengxian. There was also fighting near Qingpu Baihe Port (transliteration) west of Shanghai on Friday. Fighting also broke out on Chongming Island on the same day. The spokesman continued,

From January 21 to February 20, Japanese troops stationed in the Suzhou area fought with Chinese troops and guerrillas a total of 61 times. The Japanese army had 11 dead and 19 wounded. In addition, about 700 Chinese guerrillas active in Jurong and Danyang have been fighting with the Japanese army since the 6th of this month, and the fighting is still ongoing. These Chinese troops belong to the New Fourth Route Army and carry mortars and other military equipment.

According to Xiandai News Agency, because gunshots have been heard frequently in the West Shanghai area recently, the Japanese army is extremely fearful and has sent a large number of soldiers to reinforce the defenses. They are stationed in the Singapore Road Gonda Cotton Mill, the Robertson Road Xihe Cotton Mill, and the Toyota Cotton Mill. In addition to setting up barbed wire around them, they are also busy building watchtowers and defensive sandbag bunkers. Their state of anxiety is increasingly symbolic of being mired in a quagmire and unable to extricate themselves.

The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the Hongqiao area, where guerrillas were active the night before last (the 12th), has now returned to peace and tranquility. The "Pacification Army" was transferred out of the area yesterday, and was replaced by Japanese forces and the "Great Way Police" to garrison the area.

According to people from South Pudong, since the weather has cleared up, the fighting in the Fengxian-Songjiang area has expanded. The Japanese army has been reinforcing from Minhang and Songjiang in North Pudong across the river, attempting to connect Nanqiao, Zhuangxing, Shengzimiao, Tinglin, Hougang, and Songyin, which stretch 40 miles from east to west, into a line, maintaining a stronghold 20 miles deep from the Huangpu River, and then trying to advance to the southeast. Guerrillas and regular troops are cooperating here, launching large-scale counterattacks for days. Artillery fire fills the sky as they advance valiantly through a rain of bullets, having cut the Japanese army into three sections, tightly surrounding them. Nanqiao has been recovered, the retreat of the Japanese army in Tinglin has been cut off, and their situation is dangerous. The Japanese army in Hougang has all retreated back to Songyin, so Hougang has returned to Chinese hands. The extent of damage on both sides is still difficult to determine.

### Japanese Tax Police Arrest Landing Passengers: A Young Passenger on the "Moffat" is Deemed an "Anti-Japanese Element"

The German shipping company Reiss & Co.'s "Moffat" vessel arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo at about 1:00 PM on the 10th and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf. As a young male passenger, dressed in a Western suit and wearing a large hat, one wearing a yellow wool coat, a cabin passenger from Dinghai Shenjiamen, and the other wearing a herringbone coat, named Qiu Ahua, disembarked, they were successively stopped by the Japanese tax police of the Jianghai Customs, who arbitrarily searched them. An envelope from the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Association was found in the yellow-coated passenger's pocket, and a list of books, all anti-Japanese books, was found on Qiu's person, causing the Japanese police to become hostile and deeming him an "anti-Japanese element", and arresting him. The passenger from Dinghai was released on bail by a senior official of the Jianghai Customs, while Qiu Ahua was sent to the Japanese military headquarters. It is reported that Qiu is 25 years old, from Hengxi in South Yin County, and had studied in Japan for two months. He returned to China due to the outbreak of the war of resistance. He was illegally arrested on this trip from Ningbo to Shanghai. His life and safety are a matter of great concern.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Decides to Establish Economic Hubs in Various Provinces: Plans to Connect Factories Relocated to Sichuan, Promote Agriculture, and Establish Training Courses

Weng Wenhao, the Minister of Economic Affairs, has many plans for economic construction in the rear. Recently, in addition to gradually implementing the various implementation measures of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Extraordinary Periods promulgated last year, he has also decided to establish economic hubs to increase production, and has formulated various implementation measures. The details are recorded below.

Regarding ways to connect factories relocated to Sichuan, the Ministry believes that to implement economic management, supply and demand must be matched to speak of control. At present, unified methods have been planned for the management of tungsten, antimony, and tin mines. Since the implementation, it has been beneficial to national resources and the interests of investing merchants. In addition, although the more than 300 factories relocated to Sichuan have different businesses, their raw material supply, production, and sales have all been connected. The government encourages domestic products, society promotes them, transportation is assisted as much as possible, and economic barriers can be solidified. Therefore, in addition to necessities, the rear provinces have no difficulty in supply and demand for domestic products.

Regarding developing the economy and establishing economic hubs, the Ministry, to further develop production, has recently planned to increase raw materials and equipment for various mines and factories, and has formulated measures to encourage the production of liquid fuels. To support the rise of small industries in the interior, it is working on the establishment of ten economic hubs, which will be geographically distributed in Hunan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Gansu, Qinghai, Kangding, and other provinces, to unify the pace and enable various small industries to assist their development based on their location and environment.

Regarding promoting agriculture and establishing training courses, the Ministry has more than 70,000 cooperatives and mutual aid societies in the rear provinces, more than 80 treasuries have been established, and more than 120 warehouses have been built. To increase production and develop agriculture in the rear, it has been decided to pay attention to cultivating agricultural talents. It is preparing to open a training course for agricultural extension workers in Chongqing, with each training session scheduled to last for half a year. After consulting with Jinling University on the training steps, the university will be responsible for the training.

### Nephew Accuses Maternal Uncle: Liu Yingcen Attempts to Embezzle Property, Two Nephews Sue, Court Orders Reconciliation

Liu Yingcen, a native of Suzhou and the principal of Peichu Elementary School on Haifang Road, had an older sister who married Shen Jinwen, a native of Yangzhou who worked in banking. They had two sons, the elder named Jiezhi and the younger named Yizhi. Jinwen died of illness in 1914. Ms. Liu remained a widow to raise her sons, and she also died of illness in the winter of 1922. At that time, Jiezhi and his brother were still young, so their maternal uncle, Liu Yingcen, handled the funeral arrangements for them and sorted out and kept safe the clothing and belongings left by their sister. He told his two nephews that he would hand them over when they grew up and gave them a booklet recording the types and amounts of the inherited property to show his impartiality. After the August 13th Incident, Jiezhi and Yizhi lost their jobs one after another. For more than a year, their livelihood became increasingly difficult. Recently, they recalled what their uncle had said in their childhood and learned that Liu was now the principal of a school and was in a good situation. So they brought the booklet written by Liu Xiang's relative to Shanghai from their hometown to claim the inheritance of their parents, worth more than a thousand gold. Unexpectedly, Liu did not consider the affection, and gave them a cold shoulder. Regarding the property he had kept safe, he initially evaded the issue, and then, realizing that his nephews had solid evidence, it was very difficult for him to embezzle it. He had to admit it, but said that all the property had been used up by him, and it was difficult to return it. However, he made no indication of how to compensate them. Therefore, the two Shens hired a lawyer from Qianyuan to sue their maternal uncle Liu Yingcen for embezzlement of property in the First Special District Court, requesting punishment in accordance with Article 335, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and ordering him to return the original property or compensate for the price. Yesterday, under the trial of Judge Dai, considering that the plaintiff and defendant were nephews and uncles, it was not appropriate to harm their relationship, so he advised them to resolve the matter peacefully. Both parties were moved by the advice, and the court ordered them to withdraw and mediate themselves, and adjourned the case for further investigation.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Bans Firecrackers

At a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Defense Committee on the 6th of this month, it was decided to recommend to the Council that from May 1st of this year until further notice, the storage, possession, sale, or manufacture of firecrackers be prohibited in the concession. In the future, if the situation permits the lifting of the ban, the Council will order firecracker businesses to apply for licenses. This proposal has been approved by the Council's Board of Directors.

### Man Commits Suicide Due to Unemployment

Xu Taisheng, a young man living at No. 110, Lane 411, Dagu Road in the Public Concession, was 27 years old. Recently, due to financial difficulties and poverty, unable to support himself, he suddenly had a dark thought at 8:58 last night and secretly swallowed raw opium and poisonous liquid to commit suicide. His family members noticed and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that he had been poisoned too deeply, and his life was in danger.

### Case of New Fourth Army Pay Being Robbed: Witnesses Jia Genbao and Others Testify; The Course of Events of Commander Liang's Murder; Liang Ziqiu's Plea for Amnesty is "Cut Down by the Roots"

Liang Zuocheng, the commander of the New Fourth Army and a native of Guangdong, was traveling through Qiaoxiang Village in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, in December of the previous year with three guards, his sixteen-year-old son, and 327,000 yuan in pay. They were stopped by dozens of local bandits armed with weapons. As a result, Commander Liang, his son, and five guards were killed, and the pay was robbed and spent. Later, the army commander Ye Ting sent troops to arrest the bandit leaders Da Yuanlin, and his accomplices Chen Youfa, Qiao Detai, Qiao Yikun, Zhang Bingquan, and five other bandits. They were interrogated by Commander Ye and found to be true, and were all executed by shooting. Last year, Chinese Detective Shang Wu of the Huizhong Police Station received a report from informant Gao Binghui and arrested accomplices in the case at Beishan West Road, Shandong Road, and other places: Dai Hongfu (also known as Jigeng), Chen Heshang (i.e., the son of Chen Youfa, who had already been executed), Chen Bosheng, Qiao Changjin, Chen Qiaosheng and six other people. They were sent to the First Special District Court. After investigation by the police station, Chen Qiaosheng was found to be irrelevant and was released on bail. The four people, Dai Hongchang and others, were questioned several times and overturned and denied their previous confessions to the police station that they had obtained 150 yuan after the incident. They were ordered to be returned to prison pending review and decision by the Supreme Court's branch. Yesterday, the police station summoned Jia Baogen, Zhang Heshang, and Shen Zhigao, all natives of Jurong who worked as waiters in a bathhouse on Jiujiang Road. When Commander Liang was murdered by bandits in Qiaoxiang Village, Jurong County, Yi Zhi and others were involved. When the four defendants, Dai Hongfu and others, were escorted to the Third Criminal Court, lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station said that informant Gao Binghui had returned to his hometown last winter, fell ill and died. Now there are three witnesses, Jia Dougen and others, to testify in court, please question them. The court warned the parties that the case was of great importance, and they should not testify casually, but must be based on the facts. They were ordered to make a declaration, and Jia Baogen returned to his hometown to avoid the war after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. His home was only two miles away from Qiaoxiang Village. He knew that Commander Liang was killed between November 16 of the previous year in the lunar calendar. At that time, Commander Liang and his son and soldiers, a total of five people, passed through the area and were seen by a large number of bandits, i.e., the defendants, carrying a bag of flour containing hundreds of thousands of banknotes. They pointed out that they were criminals. Commander Liang stated that he was a formal military officer and that the banknotes were for the payment of troops 50 miles away in Maoshan. Moreover, Commander Liang and his guards were all wearing military uniforms. They ignored it and said that no matter who the officer was, he could not pass with such a large amount of money. They tied up Commander Liang, his son, and two soldiers. Commander Liang was willing to give all the banknotes as a reward to them, and release him and the soldiers to go to Maoshan and then come back to pick up his son. They refused. So at 4:00 PM that afternoon, they brought Commander Liang and his group to the mud tomb site in the back garden near the village. The defendant Dai Hongfu took out a box cannon and handed it to the defendant Qiao Changjin, who first killed Commander Liang and the three guards, and then killed Liang's sixteen-year-old son. I witnessed it all, and the defendants Chen Heshang and Chen Bosheng were also there with guns and other weapons, etc. Witness Zhang Heshang testified that he returned to his hometown in September of the previous year due to the war. That afternoon, he learned that Commander Liang and others had been murdered by bandits, i.e., the defendants. I went to the scene to see that Commander Liang and three soldiers had been killed with box cannons. However, Liang's son was asking if they could spare his life. Unexpectedly, Da Yuanlin (he was the village chief), the leader who had been arrested and executed, said that to cut the grass and eliminate the roots, he would also kill him, otherwise Qiaoxiang Village would not be safe. The defendant Qiao Changjin killed him, etc. According to Shen Zhigao's testimony, he was in his home in Shen Tie Village, three miles away from Qiaoxiang Village. On that day, in the afternoon, he also saw Commander Liang and others at the scene of the murder, holding a large piece of paper written by Yi Shu, stating that he was a formal military officer from Guangdong, who had made meritorious service in the battle in Zhabei, Shanghai, etc. The large amount of banknotes was to be sent to Maoshan to pay the soldiers under his command. Unexpectedly, the leader Da Yuanlin refused and tore up the paper. The defendant Dai Hongfu gave the box cannon to the defendant Qiao Changjin, who killed Commander Liang and others. The defendants Chen Heshang and Chen Bosheng were also at the scene, etc. When questioned, the defendants all firmly denied it. Judge Huang Risheng ruled that they should be returned to prison and reconsidered at a later date.

### Lawsuit Over Jewelry Merchant's Inheritance

Investigation to be Conducted at the Bank, Hearing Rescheduled for the 20th. Zhang Ou, the elderly mother of the late wealthy jewelry merchant Zhang Bingweng of Shanghai, is 76 years old and lives in the Continental Fang on Luban Road. Recently, she entrusted lawyers Ge Zhitan and Sun Deji to file a lawsuit in the Second Branch of the Shanghai Special District Court, accusing her son Bingxin's concubines, Zhang Qin and Zhang Dai, along with his adopted son Zhang Haoqiu and real estate tycoon Huang Ruisheng, of colluding to steal jewelry, jade articles, emeralds, and real estate stock certificates in the Salt Industry Bank safe deposit box, all sealed in suitcases, and accused Huang of receiving stolen goods and abandoning his elders, etc. After repeated hearings by Magistrate Miao Qingbang, Huang Ruisheng received a court summons, felt stimulated, and fell ill, and passed away on the 1st of this month. The defendants Qin, Dai, and Zhang Haoqiu, etc., separately hired lawyers to defend them, and were ordered to reschedule the hearing for further investigation. Details have been recorded in this newspaper several times. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Miao continued to hear the case in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff Zhang Ou was represented by lawyers Ge and Sun due to her old age and illness, and the defendants also arrived with their lawyers. After the court briefly questioned the defendants, it summoned witnesses Kong Runlin, Zhu Xianghe, Huang Songtao, Liu Qianzhen, Feng Hanchu, and Liu Chenggui to be questioned one by one. According to Kong, Zhang Bingxin was my mentor. After Zhang's death, I copied and recorded all his inherited jewelry and the assets in the safe deposit box into five copies. Later, Tu Zhengfu wrote a seal and sealed the suitcase. I was not present when the box was opened for analysis later. The remaining witnesses, Zhu Xianghe and others, only proved the valuation. At this point in the hearing, the court considered it necessary to investigate at the bank and ordered that the hearing be rescheduled to the 20th.

### Selling a Truck, Preparing to Get Married, Unexpectedly Shot Dead

Shan Jinshun (age 41), a native of Tongzhou, lived at No. 422, Seymour Road. Recently, because he wanted to marry a certain woman, he had no money to pay the various expenses. Therefore, he entrusted his fellow villager Zhou Miao, the driver, to drive his own No. 3565 truck, valued at 1,500 yuan, to Hongkou on the 11th to sell it to someone. Unexpectedly, the price was not suitable and the deal did not go through. Previously, he had discussed it with his younger brothers Shan Jinshan and Shan Jinfu. That night, his two younger brothers invited their fellow villager Xu Susheng from No. 14, Qingyuli, Doule An Road, to gather and discuss the matter. Xu then contacted someone to sell it. Shan Jinshun and the driver Zhou Miao went to dinner in the truck. Shan drank too much alcohol and often did not return at night. The next morning, he was shot dead with a handgun at the entrance of No. 14, Lane 309, Wuchang Road. The murderer could not be found. The other day, Liu Zhongcheng, a Chinese detective from the Yangshupu Police Station, learned of the sale of the car and arrested Zhou Miaokai, Xu Liansheng, Shan Jinshan, Shan Yufu and four other people one after another and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, explained the course of events and requested detention for further investigation. Judge Huang questioned the defendants and ordered them to be returned to prison for further investigation.

### Two Women Take Poison, One Dies

Two women took poison in Room 224 of the Zhongnan Hotel on Edward Road on the night before last. One was named Zhu Xiuzhen and the other was surnamed Chuan, whose name was unknown. They were both discovered by a hotel waiter and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper.

Her body will be sent to the Coroner's Office for examination. According to the deceased's family, they have been found. The reason for the double suicide is still under investigation. The condition of the woman surnamed Chuan has improved slightly, but the danger has not passed.

### Younger Brother Steals Property and Cuts His Older Sister, Further Investigation Pending

Mao Yongkang, a native of Ningbo living at No. 175, Lane 195, Lanweiai Road in the French Concession, made a living selling chickens and ducks. His wife, Lu, was 31 years old, a native of Jiashan. She had a younger brother, Lu Wenzhong, also known as Ronghua, 22 years old, who usually ate and lived at Mao's house and did nothing. On November 13 of last year, while his older sister Lu was out, Lu Wenzhong sneaked into the room and stole a pair of gold bracelets, a gold lock, and 150 yuan in cash, all belonging to his older sister. He escaped and did not return. When Lu discovered it, there was no way to recover it. Until 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month, Lu Wenzhong suddenly came back. His older sister, Lu, asked where the gold jewelry and cash were. He claimed that he had not spent it. He had found a job at Ruikai Foreign Firm at No. 130, Renji Road, and had given 200 yuan as a deposit. The remaining money and jewelry were all in the firm. He still stayed at Mao's house that night. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 AM on the 4th, as soon as Mao Lu got up to go to the toilet, Lu Wenzhong suddenly rushed into the room with a kitchen knife and, without asking why, slashed his older sister Lu on the head. She was slashed on the back of her hand because she reached out to block it. She shouted loudly and someone twisted Lu and arrested him, and he was sent to the police station for interrogation and detention at the Second Special District Court. It has been filed for investigation and further interrogation. Yesterday, President Liao rescheduled the case for one week for further investigation and prosecution. The court approved it. Without questioning him, he approved that it be rescheduled for seven days and re-interrogated. The defendant was returned to prison.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Concert

### Dismissed Chinese Detective Arrested for Drug Trafficking a Second Time After Release from Prison

Zhang Guilin, a native of Tianjin, 40 years old, lived at No. 11, Rixinli, Jinshenfu Road. He was formerly Chinese Detective No. 80 of the French Concession Police Station. He was dismissed for committing a crime. Later, he sold morphine outside and was discovered by Detective Sui Wenzhi a year ago, and sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. He was sentenced to three and a half years in prison and was serving his sentence. Because the prison released prisoners, he was released on parole. Unexpectedly, Zhang still engaged in his old business. He is now secretly selling morphine at the home of a woman from Jiangyin, Li Lou (30 years old), in the pavilion room at No. 1 in the same lane. She was hired to be an associate. Recently, Sui Wenzhi, a detective from the French Concession Police Station, found out about it and rushed there the other day, arresting Zhang and Li together and confiscating 35 packets of morphine and the money earned. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Second Special District Court and a request was made to detain him and to prosecute the case after further investigation. President Liao presided over a hearing in the First Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be detained pending further investigation and interrogation.

### Refugee Population Statistics

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department on the 12th of this month, after investigation, the department verified that 53 refugee shelters housed a total of 43,775 refugees.

### Lu Xihou and His Wife Sue the Shanghai Municipal Council for Violating Land Regulations, Forcibly Relocating Them, and Insulting Them: The Plaintiff Wins After Two Years of Litigation

Lu Xihou and his wife sued the Shanghai Consular Court, accusing the Shanghai Municipal Council of forcibly relocating them and insulting them. A judgment has now been announced and the plaintiffs, Mr. and Mrs. Lu, have won. The defendant will compensate Lu Xihou for nominal losses, totaling one yuan in national currency, and will bear the litigation and lawyer's fees, and compensate Lu's wife for damages suffered, totaling 300 yuan in national currency. The case was heard by US Consul General Gauss, British Consul General Phillips, and Japanese Consul General Miura. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Roger, and the defendant was represented by the Gao Shi Law Firm. After Commissioner Lang took the testimony of both parties on November 30 and December 1 last year, the judgment was announced today. The case arose in 1937, when the Municipal Council, in order to widen the road, acquired the property where the plaintiffs lived (the land number was 10027) and ordered them to move out before June 30 of that year. On July 1, the Municipal Council Police Station was ordered to carry out the eviction and demolish the house to build the road. Lu's wife came out to obstruct it and was detained in the Chengdu Road Police Station for about an hour before being released. When the Consular Court ruled on the case, it stated that Lu Xihou was a Chinese citizen, and only Chinese courts had jurisdiction over forced relocation. However, the Municipal Council did not obtain an order from the competent court when implementing it, which was inconsistent with the provisions of the land regulations. Moreover, Lu's wife was expelled from the house for no reason and was insulted at the time, so it ordered that the plaintiff be compensated for losses.

### Southwestern Journey Jottings (Part 1)

— Shell Factory

Since the outbreak of war, the southwestern provinces have become our base for resistance and national reconstruction, and the nation's hub. There have been many accounts of various places in the Southwest scattered in newspapers and magazines, but in the current situation, everything is changing day by day. Therefore, it is truly difficult to write a reliable record that can help travelers as a reference. Yesterday, a friend working for a certain travel agency returned to Shanghai after investigating various places in the Southwest. He reported on his journey and all the experiences one should have when going to the Southwest now. Not only is it the latest report and relatively close to the facts, but he also spoke very clearly about the common sense one should know based on his experience. I think this kind of report is much better than ordinary works that only record itineraries and en route conditions. Moreover, this kind of practical experience is what most people need to know. The following is my friend's report: I departed from Hong Kong on September 21st of last year, first arriving at Wuzhou. Transportation between Hong Kong and Wuzhou is convenient by ship. (Since the fall of Guangdong, this route has been suspended, but when the overall situation recovers in the future, this line will still be the main traffic artery from Hong Kong to Guangxi.) The ship's facilities were very good, and the food was also palatable. The city streets of Wuzhou were quite well-organized. At that time, because there were frequent air raid alerts, the market during the day was not as lively as it was at night. The people of Guangxi province all wore short clothes and cloth shoes, and they were all barefoot, even when entertaining guests. This kind of honest and frugal folk custom is truly admirable. Accommodation and food in Wuzhou are manageable, but cleanliness and hygiene have not yet become widespread. The Wuzhou bus station is in Rongxu, a town across the river from Wuzhou. The round trip river crossing uses electric boats, which takes a little more than an hour, which is quite convenient.

On the 25th, at dawn, I departed from Wuzhou for Liuzhou. Upon arriving in Rongxu, I bought a ticket and boarded the bus. All the seats were numbered, so passengers could sit in their assigned seats. Being able to buy a ticket guarantees you a seat, which is a very good system. The road surface on this section was very flat, and that evening, I arrived in Yulin, a stopover between Wuzhou and Liuzhou where passengers must disembark and stay in a hotel. However, the station is not responsible for passengers' luggage after they disembark; you must manage it yourself. Furthermore, after disembarking, you must go to the station to register your number for the next day's bus. These procedures are quite inconvenient for single travelers, so single travelers should be sure to bring as little luggage as possible. The next morning, the bus departed at 7:00 AM. We had lunch in Rong County midway, and arrived in Liuzhou at 6:00 PM. The Liuzhou authorities were very strict about inspecting luggage. Several students traveling with me had brought a deck of playing cards to pass the time on the journey. Unexpectedly, after they were discovered during inspection, they were deemed gambling tools. Although they explained, it was ultimately ineffective, and they were fined twenty yuan. Therefore, travelers entering Guangxi must not bring such entertainment items to avoid being fined.

Liuzhou is divided into north and south banks. All the marketplaces are on the north bank, and the city of Liuzhou is also located on the north bank. However, the bus station is located on the south bank. For the convenience of travelers, although hotels and restaurants are also located near the station, they are not as lively as those on the north bank. As for the overall situation of the market, it is not as prosperous as Wuzhou.

The houses in both Wuzhou and Liuzhou are very special. All the walls have iron hooks nailed into them. When I first saw them, I was very puzzled. Later, after inquiring with the locals, I learned that Wuzhou and Liuzhou often experience major floods. When the flood arrives, the houses are submerged in water, and residents enter and exit entirely by boat, entering and exiting through the windows. These iron hooks are prepared for relying on boats and climbing out during floods.

It was not easy to buy bus tickets from Liuzhou to Guiyang. I originally wanted to depart on the 28th, but I ended up being delayed until October 1st before I bought a ticket and departed from Liuzhou.

The highway north from Liuzhou belongs to the Southwest Highway Administration. The first meal stop was Yishan, where the travelers had a good meal. Zhejiang University is located here, and it is also famous because Mr. Jiang Baili died of illness here. The Yishan Special Canteen is run by the China Travel Service. The vegetables are cooked very deliciously. I heard that chickens are very cheap here, but pork is not plentiful. After the meal, the bus departed, and that evening, we arrived at Hechi—the first overnight stop. Although Hechi is also a county, it only has one straight street and doesn't even have a county seat. It's not even as lively as a town in the Jiangnan region! This street is called Fengyi Street and is made of earth. The Hechi Hostel established by the China Travel Service is located on this street, no more than half a li from the bus station. The palm-mat beds it provides are said to be the only comfortable beds of their kind in the interior. What I especially can't forget is that the hostel also has bathing facilities. A bath only costs twenty cents, but it greatly reduced the fatigue from the journey.

On the morning of October 2nd, we left Hechi. We had lunch midway at Liuzhai. After the meal, we continued on our way and could reach Dushan in the evening. The section of highway from Liuzhai to Dushan can be said to be the worst section of the Southwest Highway, and it was extremely bumpy along the way. Dushan is the second overnight stop between Liuzhou and Guiyang. There are no good hotels locally. Fortunately, the China Travel Service has set up more than a dozen improved berths in the Xie'an Hotel, so we could barely stay there. Unfortunately, there were too few berths and not enough to meet the needs of the travelers.

The next day, we departed from Dushan and first arrived at Machangping. This place is a meeting and meal stop for the eastern and southern routes of the Southwest Highway. The canteen specially run by the local Southeast Inn for the travel agency can be considered to have the best food on the entire route. I had a satisfying lunch here. That afternoon, at 5:00 PM, we reached Guiyang.

Guiyang is the capital of Guizhou province and is now considered a hub for passenger and freight transport and a center of transportation. Therefore, the general headquarters of the Southwest Highway Transportation Administration is also located here. Guizhou has always been known for its poverty, but since the outbreak of war, more and more merchants from various places have come to Guizhou, so the market is much better than before. The facilities in the local hotels are all very basic. The best environment and facilities are in the Guiyang Hostel, commissioned by the provincial government to be run by the travel agency next to the provincial library on Cotton Alley Street in the city. The only drawback is that there are not many rooms, and guests often have to go without.

On October 12th, I departed from Guiyang, first heading to Chongqing. On the first day, we had lunch at Wujiangdu. The current of the Wujiang River is very rapid. Highway buses also need to cross the river by boat. When we crossed the river, because it was autumn, the water was still calm, and there was no danger. I heard that when spring arrives, the water becomes extremely turbulent, and the danger of crossing the river is very great. We stayed overnight in Tongzi in the evening. Although Tongzi is a small place, it has electric lights because it is the hometown of Mr. Zhou Xicheng. The travel agency also runs a hostel here, which is very clean and well-arranged, and it also prepares a type of Chinese-style Western food, which is very flavorful.

We departed early the next morning, and soon entered Sichuan province. We had lunch at Songkan at noon. After the meal, we boarded the bus again, and that night, we stayed in Qijiang. This place in Qijiang is extremely simple. After searching for a long time, we couldn't find a good hotel. Later, we stopped at a relatively large hotel. The beds there were made of bamboo planks, covered with a layer of straw mat, and there were no pillows. A cotton quilt was both narrow and short, and a woolen blanket was both torn and dirty. Before I could even close my eyes, mosquitoes and bedbugs came to attack me one after another. For people who are tired after a long journey, how painful it is to not be able to get a good night's sleep! In this hopeless environment, I came up with a passive way to resist. I bought several large sheets of tung oil paper to spread underneath to ward off bedbugs, and used a large bed sheet to cover myself from head to toe to control mosquitoes. Surprisingly, I slept soundly through the night and was not attacked. From this experience, it can be seen that when traveling to the interior these days, a large bed sheet and two sheets of tung oil paper are indispensable companions!

### Steamship Company Manager Accused of Fraud

Ruan Wende, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 1, Bulinli, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, French Concession, 32 years old, recently retained a lawyer as his agent and filed a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court against Zhang Shuchun and Lin Changxiang for fraud and obtaining property. He requested an investigation and also filed a related civil suit. According to the statement, the plaintiff was introduced by the defendants and Qian Hongting in November of last year to work as a compradore on the Daxiship, operated by the Jiangyun Steamship Company managed by the defendants. It was stipulated that the monthly salary would be 80 yuan, and he was instructed to pay a security deposit of 300 yuan, which was received by the defendants and a receipt was issued. Unexpectedly, when the ship arrived in Shanghai on December 16, the plaintiff led two colleagues, intending to board the ship to work. To his surprise, the defendants suddenly refused and instead commissioned Qian Hongting to disembark. The plaintiff negotiated with them, and they agreed that he could board the ship to work when the next ship arrived. However, the Daxiship returned to Shanghai from the port on the 26th of the same month and was immediately disbanded. The plaintiff then demanded the return of the security deposit, but the defendants repeatedly evaded the issue and showed no sincerity in returning the money. Only then did he realize that he had been deceived. He requested the court to investigate and punish the defendants in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law and to recover the security deposit of 300 yuan that he had paid. The court accepted the case. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Liquan opened a hearing and summoned the defendants. The plaintiff arrived with his lawyer and stated the previous situation. The defendants also arrived with their defense lawyers, Wan Weijian and Xu Jianjie. They stated that the ship had indeed sailed and that a receipt had been issued for the money received. Furthermore, when the ship was sailing, the plaintiff sent Yu Wenxing to work on board. They argued that the case was purely civil in nature and requested a clear investigation. The court examined the arguments and, finding that the facts were clear, ordered a debate and then announced the conclusion of the hearing, scheduling the judgment for the 17th.

### Attempted Assassination of Hua Runquan Sentenced to Two and a Half Years

Tang Yuqing, a local resident, was previously arrested for shooting at Hua Runquan in the elevator of the Enterprise Building at No. 33 Sichuan Road, but missing. Police officers recovered a pistol and more than ten bullets abandoned by Tang et al. at the scene. The case was handed over to the First Special Court, and the interrogation had been completed, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the judge hearing the case announced the judgment in criminal court. The Chinese text stated: Tang Yuqing is sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment for the crime of attempted murder. The pistol and bullets are to be confiscated.

### Specializing in Stealing from Prostitutes, Sentenced to Two Years and Eight Months

The rogue Lin Genbao does not engage in honest work and makes a living by cheating women out of their property. Recently, he repeatedly hired prostitutes, intoxicated them with alcohol, and stole the jewelry they wore and the money in their wallets. The victims included Sister Chen of Shunfeng and Zhao Huifang of Yang Guifei. He was arrested by Detective Wang Shanqing of the Lao Zha Police Station and sent to the First Special Court. Attorney Ru Bao-yi of the police station prosecuted him according to law. The interrogation has been completed. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide announced the judgment in the First Criminal Court, sentencing Lin Genbao to two years and eight months of imprisonment to punish evil and serve as a warning to others.

### Chu Minyi and Others Give Farewell Banquet for Overseas Chinese Inspection Group

They Will Report Back to Siam and Exert Efforts to Promote National Goods

Chu Minyi and Xie Zhongfu hosted a farewell banquet yesterday for the Siamese Overseas Chinese Inspection Group. Six overseas Chinese, including Wu Jijiu, attended, along with Lin Kanghou and others as guests of honor. The group expressed satisfaction with the Shanghai National Goods Factory Union's arrangement for General Manager Ma Xishen to accompany them on visits to various member factories and expressed their gratitude. They stated that overseas Chinese compatriots love their motherland and that after reporting on the visit to Siam, the compatriots would be willing to purchase goods produced by various national goods factories in the future, and sales would inevitably increase.

### Incidents of Robbery

At around 7:00 PM yesterday evening, a residence with the surname of a certain family at No. 4, Lane 509, Fujian Road (i.e., Shilu), was suddenly broken into by five robbers while the men and women in the house were sitting at the table for dinner. Two robbers carried firearms and ordered everyone to remain silent. They ransacked the place and searched everywhere, stealing a total of more than two thousand yuan. The victims provided a detailed list of the stolen items and reported the incident to the Lao Zha Police Station, requesting an investigation.

At around 10:00 PM last night, a certain watch store at No. 519 Zhejiang Road was about to close when three robbers from Fujian suddenly broke in to rob it. Only one of the robbers was carrying a firearm. However, at that time, an apprentice of the store was lingering outside and witnessed the group entering. Seeing their suspicious behavior, he went to the nearby police post at No. 441 to report the incident and shouted for help to catch the robbers. The robbers heard this and panicked. They did not have time to rob anything and turned around to flee. However, the police officer at post No. 441 had already arrived and grabbed the robber at the rear, arresting him on the spot. He was immediately taken to the police station for investigation, and the remaining accomplices were being pursued. The watch store suffered no losses as a result.

At around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, a woman was walking along Haizhou Road in Pudong when she was suddenly stopped by four robbers. One robber pulled out a gun and threatened her, stealing more than one hundred yuan in legal tender from her pocket. They fled in different directions. The incident was reported to the Yangshupu Police Station for investigation.

### Fire Incidents

At 10:10 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in a bungalow at No. 33, Lane 343, Yangzho Rd., Pudong. Thick smoke filled the air. Upon receiving the news, the fire brigade immediately dispatched vehicles and extinguished the fire. As a result, one bungalow was burned down. At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen of the foreign manager's residence at No. 1, Foreign Apartment, No. 351 Albert Road. Upon receiving the news, the fire brigade immediately dispatched vehicles to put out the fire and extinguished it quickly. The damage was minimal. The cause of the fire was reportedly due to the carelessness of the chief steward.

A fire was reported at around 9:04 PM last night at a residence at No. 495, Maqi Road, Chedaijiao, Hongqiao. The flames were raging and unapproachable. It immediately spread to the neighboring houses at No. 496, No. 497, and No. 498. The fire brigade dispatched hose wagons and worked hard to put out the fire, which was extinguished at around 10:30 PM. As a result, four bungalows were burned down.

### Continuation of Vocational Training for Male and Female Refugee Trainees

The Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center at No. 1200, Gordons Road, Xinzha, is the only organization in this city that provides production opportunities for refugees. Since its establishment more than a year ago, its various products, such as Chinese and Western furniture, various lacquerware, educational toys, embroidery of various sizes, towels, soap, etc., have been well received by the society. The National Government Relief and Rehabilitation Commission has repeatedly sent personnel to inspect it and has found the results to be excellent and has issued a commendation order. It is now heard that the first batch of refugee trainees at the center has completed their training and has successively left the center for employment. The center is now continuing to admit the second batch of refugee trainees. Any male or female refugees who are interested in learning a trade may apply for admission to the center with a guarantor. This is truly good news for the refugees.

### Daily Necessities for Citizens: Vegetable Prices Rise, Fuel Prices Fall

Scarce Vegetable Sources, Fuel Supply Exceeds Demand

The daily necessities for citizens, such as vegetables and fuel, have recently experienced some fluctuations. The reason for this is due to traffic congestion and erratic weather. However, poor citizens are finding that their income is not enough to cover their expenses, and they are all complaining bitterly. Here is a detailed account of the situation:

Vegetables: The various vegetables needed by citizens are transported to Shanghai for sale from the suburbs of Shanghai and the Ningbo production area. Although shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo has been smooth recently, and vegetables from Ningbo are arriving in a steady stream, suburban vegetable vendors are finding it difficult to purchase vegetables due to the changing situation. Furthermore, due to continuous rain, the roads are muddy, so most vegetable vendors are unable to transport vegetables. As a result, the supply is scarce and prices have risen. Small vegetable markets mainly sell chives, rape, and bok choy. The prices of fresh fish such as small yellow croaker have also risen. Purchasers are all complaining bitterly, and their burden has increased.

Fuel: The supply of white coal has been scarce in recent days, with only Hebei white coal being sold on the market. However, the origin of this white coal is questionable, so some coal merchants refuse to sell it on commission. Fortunately, the severe winter has passed, and usage is decreasing daily, so there is no cause for panic. Coal balls and coal have been shipped in large quantities in recent days, and prices have fallen slightly. A reporter from Xin Sheng She learned from the firewood and charcoal industry yesterday that although the fuel supply has been intermittent due to traffic congestion, the firewood and charcoal dealers have sent personnel to the Wenzhou production area to purchase firewood and charcoal. Once shipping is smooth, they will find ways to transport it to Shanghai. Therefore, although transportation is sometimes interrupted, the price can still be stabilized.

### Citizens Form Fundraising Committee, Hold Team Leader Meeting

Submit Fundraising Results and Assign Sponsorship Numbers to Commence Within Days

The Citizens' Group Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association will hold its second team leader meeting tomorrow at 3:00 PM at the Central Vegetable Market on Fourth Malu to submit the results of the third round of fundraising and to discuss continuing to promote fundraising work. All 130-plus team leaders and deputy team leaders of the association will participate, and the chairman and secretary-general of the association will be invited to attend and provide guidance. The assignment of refugee sponsorship numbers and the distribution of refugee photographs and thank-you letters have been delayed until now because the Dunxin Road Reception Center has not yet completed its intake of refugees. The process is now being actively carried out and is nearing completion. It is heard that distribution to the philanthropists who have sponsored refugees will begin within days. In addition, the association has released statistics on sponsorship households, showing that as of the end of February, a total of 8,109 households have been sponsored, including 310 households sponsoring 5 people for more than six months, 228 households sponsoring 10 people for more than six months, and 28 households sponsoring 50 people for more than six months.

### Central Savings Association Holds Lottery Today

The Central Savings Association holds a lottery every month on the 15th according to its regulations. The 36th lottery will be held today at 2:00 PM at the association's office at No. 2 Tianjin Road. The special prize money has reached more than 26,000 yuan. There are 26 prizes each for the first, second, third, and fourth prizes, as well as many consolation prizes and last-digit prizes. Those who wish to save can still pay to join the association before 11:00 AM today. The association will issue a temporary receipt with a number, which will entitle them to the generous lottery privileges.

### Women Applying to Be Postal Workers Have No Hope for Now

Due to the Inconvenience of Transferring to Other Locations

The Shanghai Postal Administration will henceforth focus on hiring men for postal worker positions. The opportunity for women to participate will be very limited. However, there is still a possibility for them to be hired as postal assistants. This is because female postal workers are not as easily transferred as men. However, this restriction may not be satisfactory to women who aspire to become postal workers. But given the current situation, women applying to be postal workers will have to wait for now.

### Puppet Municipal Government Levies "Ship Tax"

The revenue of the puppet "municipal government" has been cut off, and it is experiencing financial difficulties. It is actively engaged in extortion to make up for the deficit. The puppet "Finance Bureau" has now established puppet "ship tax collection offices" in the puppet "Public Works Bureau's" Pudong and Hongqiao puppet "Ship Management Sub-Offices" to levy a puppet "ship tax." This was implemented simultaneously starting yesterday. Fearing that civilian boat owners would evade the puppet "tax," they have also dispatched sampans to board ships in the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek to forcibly collect the tax. The puppet officials are like wolves and tigers and are unreasonable. The puppet "tax" amount is very large and is levied quarterly. The planned rates are 1.20 yuan per quarter for paddle boats, 0.90 yuan for sampans, 1.75 yuan for cargo ships under 20 tons, 3.75 yuan for cargo ships under 40 tons, 8.50 yuan for cargo ships under 60 tons, 10.20 yuan for cargo ships under 80 tons, and 12 yuan for cargo ships over 80 tons.

### British Rear Admiral Inspects Lower Yangtze River

The North China Daily News reports that British Rear Admiral Holt of the Yangtze River Fleet left Shanghai yesterday (the 13th) aboard the British warship HMS Scorpion for Wuhu downstream to anchor for about three days. The ship will then sail to Wuhu and remain there for several days before returning to Shanghai. According to British naval personnel, this trip is a routine inspection.

### 法租界消防隊　副隊長返法

According to the French Shanghai Daily News on the 14th, the deputy captain of the French Concession Fire Brigade, a sergeant, has returned to France on leave for recuperation.  Recently, the captain of the brigade, Luo Yiai, held a farewell ceremony for firefighters at Gujiazhai Park. In the evening, a tea party was held at the French General Association as a send-off.  It is also reported that among those who recently returned to their country on the French mail ship "Arashon" were Han Lishi, the manager of the Annam Tokyo Coal Company, and Dr. Jia Lun, a representative of the International Red Cross.

Expanding the Solicitation of Preferential Treatment for Manufacturers.  The Shanghai Municipal Primary School Education Personnel Consumer Cooperative has been established for nearly two months.  It has secured its address at Room 405, 4th Floor, No. 210 Jiujiang Road and is scheduled to open for business on March 16.  The goods operated will be temporarily limited to books, stationery, living materials, and daily necessities. Because the cooperative does not aim to make profits, the prices of goods are lower than the market prices. Now the cooperative is engaged in expanding contacts with manufacturers in order to obtain special preferential treatment. It is hoped that all manufacturers will enthusiastically support and participate in the success. The cooperative especially welcomes those who can proactively contact them.

Shaoxing natives Zhang Tianjue, Luo Lican, Zhu Xinpei, Huang Yantang, Liu Zhifang, Hu Hanzhu, etc., believe that there are many Shaoxing compatriots in Shanghai, but there is little contact on weekdays, so they organized the Jujishe Dinner Party. The publishing committee of the society has specially produced a "Shaoxing News," which specializes in publishing local news, so that people can know the news of their hometown. The newspaper is edited by Hu Hanzhu and has now been published.  Report of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall.  The Shanghai Charity Group Tongren Fuyuan Hall's various charitable activities in February: distribution of alimony for widows, elderly, and disabled (one yuan per person); support for orphans (eight jiao per person); a total of 552.80 national currency yuan; 209 large coffins provided; 452 small coffins provided; 55 large corpses collected in the South City; 29 small corpses collected; 4 large corpses collected by the Salvation Bureau; 5 small corpses collected; 1,739 large and small corpses collected by the French Concession Branch Hall; 72 large corpses inspected by the corpse examination office; 165 small corpses inspected; 492 large and small corpses buried in the Pubei Beicai Cemetery; bodies, large and small, without coffins, collected at the Hongqiao Temporary Cemetery, were cremated by the Health Department of the French Public Works Bureau.

### The Merit of Cold

— Ji Qian

When the weather is cold and the ground is freezing, with ice and snow covering the roads, adding more cotton clothes does not provide warmth, and fingers drop and skin cracks, trees, flowers, crops, and even all kinds of birds and animals inevitably freeze to death, and humans also get sick and die from the cold. Therefore, many blame the harm caused by the cold. However, from the perspective of animal evolution, cold actually has a great merit.

(1) The Emergence of Warm-Blooded Animals
Approximately 200 million years ago (Mesozoic Era), there were many reptiles, and their bodies were also large. Various dinosaurs and flying reptiles were their representatives. The Earth underwent major changes, and ice ages appeared. The temperature dropped extremely low, making it difficult for various large reptiles to survive, and they gradually became extinct. However, some species that were good at adapting to the environment were able to increase the speed of their metabolism due to the excessive cold. Their body temperature rose, gradually changing from cold-blooded to warm-blooded, allowing them to maintain the vitality of their lives without becoming stiff and withered. Because of their agile physical activities, they were unwilling to be invaded by the cold on the ground, so they began to raise their bodies, moving away from the ground, unlike ordinary reptiles that kept their abdomen close to the ground. Through continuous evolution over a long period, birds and mammals eventually appeared.

(2) The Evolution of Animal Behavior
Mammals 60 million years ago (Cenozoic Era) were large-bodied and slow-moving, such as the large armadillo, the large tree shrew, and the elephant, which could live in temperate climates. During this era, there were four ice ages, and the threat of severe cold was even greater than before. Slow-moving animals could not escape in time and froze to death, leading to extinction. At that time, there were also smaller, faster-moving animals such as camels, rhinoceroses, elephants, and horses that could escape unharmed. Over time, they evolved into the species we have today.

(3) The Dawn of Human Culture
The theory that humans descended from apes is a scientific fact and there is no room for disagreement. During the most recent period (Pleistocene epoch), humans had already appeared in the world, and their lives were no different from those of other primates (apes, monkeys, and humans all belong to this category). They lived in forests, mostly living in trees. Later, the forests on the Earth were destroyed by glaciers, and primates migrated from north to south to avoid the severe cold, while glaciers also moved from north to south. When the forest areas were completely destroyed, primitive humans were forced to abandon their forest life and eagerly sought what they could eat and what they could wear to avoid the desperation of hunger and cold, in order to overcome nature and not be困 by the climate. Living in an icy and snowy environment, the threat of the environment became even greater. Humans, having evolved from primates, were superior to all apes, and their innate wisdom had to be used to the fullest. As their wisdom was used more and more, it evolved more and more. First, they invented the use of fire to reduce the invasion of cold. Then, they were able to drive various animals, eat their meat, and wear their skins to increase their ability to resist cold. They further controlled nature and created primitive culture.

### From Horse Racing Photography to Sound Films

— Dan

It is said that in 1871, a senator from California named Stanford made a bet with someone, saying that a horse running fast would never have all four feet off the ground at the same time. Another Englishman, named Muybridge, placed many cameras along the side of the race track, using electrical contact to photograph the running horse. He proved that a running horse always had one foot on the ground. This incident indicated the possibility of moving pictures.

In 1880, Muybridge created a "zoopraxiscope" in San Francisco, which could project images from glass plates onto a screen. Later, he discussed with Edison about combining his zoopraxiscope with the phonograph. By 1883, he was abroad, often discussing this matter with Marey of the French Academy.

Marey was the first to use continuous film, although the credit for making continuous film as perfect as it is today must go to Eastman of the United States.

In 1893, Lumière created the first film projector. By 1896, Edison also invented his kinetoscope. These machines are the models for today's greatly improved movie cameras.

The earliest films were silent, and the plot and dialogue of the characters were indicated by subtitles. However, people at the time believed that silent films were just a transitional product, and sound films were definitely expected.

Sound films also came about through gradual improvements. At first, there was only musical accompaniment, then one or two songs or a segment of speech were interspersed into the film, and finally there were films with complete sound and dialogue.

How are these sound films made? There are two methods: One is easy to understand, because it uses the phonograph that we are familiar with. The difficulty of this method lies in how to make the rotation speed of the phonograph and the speed of the film completely consistent. After much research and experimentation, this problem was solved. The method is as follows: one or several microphones are used to make the sound waves cause fluctuations in the current. The current that fluctuates with the sound from the microphone is then introduced into a set of vacuum tube amplifiers, which amplify it sufficiently to drive the recorder. Then, this current is introduced into the recorder, which turns it into mechanical vibrations and records it on a soft wax disc. The camera and the turntable holding the wax disc are driven by two synchronous AC motors, which have equal speeds from beginning to end, so the action and speech are completely synchronized.

When playing the movie, this wax disc is placed on a turntable connected to the projector and driven by the same motor. The phonograph record and the film begin to play simultaneously. As the needle passes through the grooves in the wax disc, it causes a small magnet to vibrate, creating a weak current whose fluctuations are the same as the current in the microphone during filming. This current is then amplified and introduced into a loudspeaker, so the original sound is emitted. The above is the "Vitaphone" method.

Another method is to record sound on the edge of continuous film, which is the so-called "Movietone" method. In this method, as in the first method, the vibrations of the sound are first converted into current fluctuations in the microphone and amplified. Then, this amplified current is introduced into a glow discharge vacuum tube, whose light intensity depends on the fluctuations of the introduced current. This changing light, after passing through a narrow slit, is focused on the edge of the film by a set of lenses. Therefore, when the film is developed, not only does it show a set of pictures of the scene, but there is also a set of simultaneous sound pictures on both sides. These sound pictures are a series of lines of varying darkness or length, which correspond to the sound emitted by the microphone.

When using this method to project sound films, the film is passed through a film projector equipped with a sound attachment. In this attachment, a beam of light shines through the part of the film where the sound has been recorded, and the intensity and frequency of the light coming out of it vary according to the sound track. This changing light beam is projected onto a strange device that can sense light and generate electricity, called a photoelectric tube. As a result, a fluctuating current equivalent to the original sound is generated in the tube. This current is amplified and introduced into a powerful loudspeaker close to the back of the screen, emitting a sound that is synchronized with the action in the film.

### The Parachute Jump Tower at the New York World's Fair

— Yuan

Everyone Can Try It

Now is a period of advancement in aviation technology, and countries are sparing no effort in promoting the aviation industry.

Towers for practicing parachuting are gradually being adopted by the aviation industry to give beginner pilots some experience with parachuting. Therefore, the International Parachute Practice Association has built a parachute jump tower at this World's Fair to give visitors a chance to try it out, in order to attract public attention.

Aviators need sufficient experience to suddenly jump out of an airplane when the parachute is not open. The tower has, of course, minimized all the normal dangers of parachuting, and there is no need to teach passengers how to pull the rope or move the mechanism to make the parachute open automatically.

The parachute on the tower is 32 feet in diameter, and it is kept permanently open by a large metal ring. The person trying it is strapped into a two-person seat suspended under the parachute, which is very stable and comfortable. When a mechanism is flipped, the parachute descends. When the parachute descends, it is prevented from swinging because the edges are limited by vertical steel cables. Furthermore, because of a special device that absorbs vibrations, there is no shock when landing. After the parachute reaches the ground, it can be pulled back to the top of the tower for another person to try.

The tower has a total of eleven parachutes, which are all available at any time. Each ascent or descent takes about one and a half minutes. Although the person trying it cannot get the full experience of parachuting from an airplane, they can at least get a novel experience and get a chance to overlook the entire field from a height of 250 feet. The entire tower weighs 170 pounds, but its construction is so clever that it can be dismantled and used elsewhere.

The parachute jump tower at the World's Fair for people to try.

### Large and Small Conveniences

— Qiaoxia Ke

What I want to talk about is defecation and urination, cough, it really is a stinky article!

In the past, there was a self-proclaimed talented scholar who chanted seven characters: "Looking from afar, the city wall is like sawtooths," and thought it was amazing. Therefore, he thought that Yan Yuan was the only person among the ancients who was like him, so he thought of his short life and cried bitterly. His neighbor ran over to ask the reason and comforted him, saying that Yan Yuan was drowned because the lower path was blocked. Your feet can let out good farts, so there is no worry about your life.

Whether defecation or urination is blocked, if it exceeds a certain degree, there is indeed a risk of death. Therefore, large and small conveniences are very important to life. Now, let's talk casually about the knowledge of the imperial examination about the two conveniences. We think that defecation is always transformed from the things that are eaten. That's right, but it's not entirely true, and it's bound to cause misunderstanding. Try asking a few midwifery ladies, they can tell you that newborn babies often poop a pile of feces. This dung comes from the womb, so it is called meconium. The fetus has never eaten yellow rice, green vegetables, or even European and American dishes in the mother's womb. This dung is transformed from the fetus's own things. So if you want to say it all, you should say that part of the defecation comes from external food, and another part of the defecation comes from internal things. If we think about it again, we won't misunderstand that all the things that are eaten are transformed into defecation, because in this way, we are eating in vain. Children eat milk to grow meat. How can they grow bigger day by day if they are completely transformed into defecation? The most annoying thing about defecation is that special woody fragrance. We can't help but ask, if we eat fragrant things, why do we poop out stinky things? Where is the transformation? It turns out that after digestion, what comes next when passing through the intestinal tract is putrefaction. There is not much difference in principle between this "transformation" and that "transformation." In herbivorous animals, putrefaction helps digestion. However, putrefaction produces stinky things, so people have to cover their noses and sigh. However, I have to declare one thing: a certain stinky substance in feces has the fragrance of jasmine when it is in a pure state, and some hair tonics even use it. Now we have to call urination. Try to think of the human body as a coal-burning stove—this is an inappropriate analogy, but it is still useful—then, the chimney and the door under the stove together are the lungs, the semi-coked coal lumps containing gravel are defecation, and the ashes left after burning are urination. People who walk past the "No Urinating" sign and urinate more often hum the old tune of "stinky and unbearable," but this is no longer the true color of urination. Urination has the fragrance of freshly cooked meat soup when it first comes out. If you don't believe it, please compare it with each other. In ancient times, there was a method of drinking children's urine in our country. I don't know what it was based on at that time. Now I know that in certain situations, urination (not necessarily children's urine) contains other valuable things related to health besides ashes. Its name is called hormone, which can be said to be a modern tonic, with the same popularity as vitamins. So eating urination, although it is unavoidable to be a bit old-fashioned, as long as you eat it properly, it is harmless.

The talk box must end; since the content of large and small conveniences is mainly residual coal and ashes, we know that poor output will inevitably hinder combustion, and blocked output will cause the stove to go out. Wasn't the famous Yan Yuan also short-lived because of the blocked lower path? But I must solemnly declare that this is what the talented scholar's neighbor said.

### Burying Modern History

— Yu Shang

Leaving it to Archaeologists 5,000 Years from Now

The 1939 New York World's Fair, which is about to open, has buried a memorial tube made of special materials 50 feet deep under the Westinghouse display building in order to preserve an accurate record of modern life, that is, various items representing the present era, for 5,000 years. Its outer shell weighs 800 pounds and is made of a copper alloy called Cupaloy.

Various commemorative items—including the recipe for making Cupaloy—are sealed in a six-foot-long inner tube. This tube is made of heat-resistant glass, and the air inside the tube is evacuated and replaced with inert gas as a preservative. After sealing, it is wrapped with glass tape and covered with waterproof material, and then placed inside the Cupaloy outer tube, and the outer tube is sealed tightly.

The Cupaloy alloy is made of copper, chromium, and a small amount of silver. It is as hard as copper. It is the result of five years of research by scientists at Westinghouse Electric Company. These researchers found that mixing silver into copper-chromium can increase the strength of copper and chromium. They believe that this outer shell can resist the erosion of seawater seeping into the New York foundation for 5,000 years. Once copper is etched, it is covered with a protective film, which can prevent the internal metal from being further eroded by seawater. Scientists believe that the presence of chromium in this copper alloy can increase the protective effect of this film.

Milk Can Be Made into Wine

The Danish milk industry has a by-product when making milk, namely the water in the milk, which is produced in large quantities, but has not been utilized. They have been working hard to study how to turn this discarded liquid into a useful food. One recent result of the research is that a fine wine can be made from the water in milk. Although this method is still in the experimental stage, if milk sheds all over Denmark adopt this method, based on the possible results now, 1.5 million Danish kroner can be obtained each year.

Fertilizers Can Preserve Beets

Beet growers and sugar producers often pile up beets, causing them to rot and suffer losses. According to recent test results, using phosphate as a fertilizer to cultivate beets can not only increase production but also increase the potential to resist decay. Beets grown from soil lacking phosphate decay three to five times more than those grown from soil with adequate phosphate.

Sweaty Odor Also Has Uses

The sweaty odor excreted by the human body now also has uses in industry. Human sebacic acid is an important component in human sweaty odor. Scientists are now synthesizing it into an important raw material with a wide range of uses. It can be used to make plasticizers to soften plastics, and it can also be used to make a new resin to produce a fiber that is far superior to ordinary rayon. Capric acid is related to the sweaty odor on goats, just like sebacic acid is related to the human body. Since it was synthesized into an industrial raw material recently, it has also had many important uses.

The products made from this acid do not necessarily have the same odor. Many products not only have no odor but also have a fragrance.

Radio Ultrashort Waves Can Bend

Radio ultrashort waves have always been thought to travel in straight lines like light, but according to a recent report from the California Institute of Technology in the United States, ultrashort waves can actually bend around the Earth's surface, so scientists' dreams of using ultrashort waves to create secret wartime signals have been dealt a major blow. Professors Potapenko and Epstein of the institute have recently completed their preliminary research, indicating that 5-meter and 1-meter long radio waves can be received at sea 18 miles apart.

### Seeing Off Students "Throwing Down the Pen to Join the Army"

— Mao Lie

More than ten students from Fudan and Datong Universities in this city have already set off for the interior to serve the country the day before yesterday. They truly put into practice the saying "throwing down the pen to join the army."

However, we know that Ban Dingyuan's motive for "throwing down the pen to join the army" was "to achieve merit in foreign lands and obtain a noble title," focusing entirely on personal gain. But our departing gentlemen are focused entirely on the independence and freedom of the nation and people. Compared to Ban, this "throwing down the pen to join the army" has more meaning. We have always admired Ban Dingyuan, considering him ambitious in his youth, so how can we not solemnly pay our respects to these ten-odd students serving the nation and wish them an early triumphant return!

I do not know these ten-odd loyal and courageous youths, nor do I know what their living environment is like in Shanghai. But the newspaper says they are all "sons of wealthy families," which arouses my boundless respect and admiration even more.

I have seen many "sons of wealthy families" in Shanghai. Generally speaking, their attitude is frivolous; they frequent dance halls and brothels; they do not read books, and even when they are in school, they are just going through the motions; they do not know about the world or the country, they only know about fine wine and women; they are not promising young people, but rather dregs of a patriarchal society, spoiled young masters; they are simply not human, but walking corpses! ... I have completely despaired of them, believing that China would be better off without this group of treasures—forgive me for not being able to say that sentence.

Now, these ten-odd "sons of wealthy families" have finally earned a breath of fresh air for others of their status, giving me hope again from despair. Therefore, personally, I am even more grateful to these ten-odd young people. I must pay them solemn respect and wish them an early triumphant return.

The turbulence of the times is still ceaselessly ongoing, and there must be many more who will be inspired to rise up! I do not necessarily advocate that all young students in Shanghai should go to the interior to serve the country like these ten-odd students—if everyone were willing to do so, of course, that would be the best—but I believe that every sensible young student can think for themselves whether or not to embark on this glorious path; if they want to, I hope they will go without hesitation! If they don't want to, then they should also lead a serious life in Shanghai and seek other ways to serve the country, instead of being confused and decadent!

These ten-odd students are the first batch to set off this year. I hope to use my worn-out pen to see off a second, third, and even countless more batches like this soon.

### Song of Dawn

— Li Chen

In the winding mountains, the highway climbs over them, sometimes high, sometimes low: the tortuous river intersects with it, forming a small plain.

Asking about the time, it was a few months after the storm. Under the coercion of death and cold, no breath of life could be found here. The villages, near and far, had turned to ashes. Standing on the bridge, one could see the distance without obstruction; the naked wilderness spread out silently. The wilderness road, symbolizing the terror of death, stretched into the boundless distance, longer and longer.

By the bridge with barbed wire, there appeared two puppet-like soldiers. To break the silence, the short, fat one was humming a song randomly; the other, tall and thin, stood aside, his eyes darting around like a rat's. "Bring your gun and compare it with mine!"

The short, fat one suddenly ordered loudly. The other person, as if waking from a dream, slowly took down his gun.

"Hehe, it's more than an inch shorter than mine!" When the two guns were placed together, his bloated body moved around like a drunkard. Then, he laughed "victoriously": "Haha, how can the guns of subjugated people be any good?"

The insulted man frowned in anguish, and then he thought of home. "Hehe, the gun of the subjugated…" The laughter rang out greedily again.

He finally made up his mind. He felt that this was a good opportunity when he saw the arrogant face and the short gun on his body.

"Bang!"

Just like a full tire deflating, the result of the arrogant glutton was lying stiff on the ground forever!

The sunset dyed the azure blue sky with various colors of clouds. Under the crimson sunlight, the lazy earth was covered with a layer of shadows. The tall and thin man, holding two "German-made" long guns, walked down the bridge vigorously.

"Go down!" With a forceful kick of his big leather boots, the short, fat body rolled down into the river. Then he hummed:

I feel that I should do this, parents, wife,… the death of the whole family. How can it stop me! Wake up, dead wilderness! Spring is waiting for your waking yawns! This is the eve of dawn. If you don't go to greet it, you will miss it forever!

He had already climbed up the hillside, his eyes shining with a green light, gazing into the distance, "After crossing that mountain, it should be the headquarters of the guerrillas!" he thought.

The approaching night closed in from all directions, making the earth even more silent. However, he was not alone, because the song of victory accompanied him on his way.

Half an hour ago, he was still a scourge of the earth; and now? He was already the earth's nanny!

### Must Speak

— Geng Zhi

In a certain place, at a certain time, or to a certain person, if speaking is inappropriate, it is called a "slip of the tongue." The result of a slip of the tongue can even cause "disaster from the mouth," so it can be seen that speaking must be careful. Confucius said, "Speak after considering the time." This "time" makes great sense, and can include time, place, and person. He was "a sage who knew the times," and the "time" of speaking probably helped him become a "sage" quite a bit.

But now some people do not study these things, and even violate these important elements of speaking, but not only will they not cause "disaster," they can still become "celebrities," "scholars," or "tycoons" in a certain field. After all, "those who come later surpass those who came before," and perhaps the ancients are not as good as the present people in this regard.

There is a certain celebrity who, when he was not successful, would always go on stage or stand up to speak whenever there was a public gathering, regardless of how many people were there, who they were, or what they were discussing. Sometimes his words were endless, and he could speak for one or two hours, making people feel confused, but sometimes they were extremely simple, only these few sentences: "Today, I am very happy to be able to meet you all. Today, I am very happy to be able to meet you all."

He was very bold, and even in gatherings of Europeans and Americans, he would solemnly go on stage or stand up, and repeatedly say in a solemn and forceful tone, "Ladies and Gentlemen Ladies and Gentlemen." After saying it a few times, with nothing further to say, he would bow or nod and walk down from the microphone or sit down with composure.

It is said that there are many people who speak everywhere like this, although some are more clever than this celebrity, and indeed speak more fluently, or have some meaning in what they say. As for what their purpose is, I think everyone can guess, it is nothing more than wanting to stand out.

In fact, there are many ways to stand out, and it is not necessary to "must speak" like this. This can be said to be the hardline faction, and there is also a softline faction that makes people believe him without realizing it. The "must speak" of the softline faction is like this!

In Mr. A's place, he must mention Mr. B, whose status, reputation, and influence are similar to Mr. A's, and seems to casually mention that Mr. B and he have some close relationship, or work together, or have intimate conversations, or engage in the same kind of entertainment. In Mr. B's place, he can naturally say grandly how he had been at Mr. A's place, with exaggerated descriptions and dazzling details, all of which are relevant to the topic. Similarly, in Mr. C's place and even Mr. X's place, he can consistently use the same kind of "must" speak. Over time, these gentlemen will all consider him "Old So-and-so," "Brother So-and-so," "one of us," or "a very familiar person." The magic is beyond words, and he will surely stand out.

However, the skill of the softline faction is more difficult than that of the hardline faction, although the success of the softline faction is faster and greater. He can no longer be as "incoherent" or "irrelevant" as the hardline faction. In addition to having a composed attitude and a very good appearance, he must have tactful language that can win the favor of the person he is talking to. He must have some "three-legged cat" knowledge of the three religions and nine streams, the hundred schools of thought, and when he speaks, it seems to make sense, as if it were a very important matter. Otherwise, if he opens his mouth and shows his throat, the Mr. So-and-so across from him will "look at him in a different light."

However, the softline faction and the hardline faction still have one thing in common, which serves as the vanguard of "must speak," and that is a thick skin. "With great courage and a thick face, you can go anywhere," that is what it means.

"A lady does not speak, but when she speaks, she hits the mark"; "When speaking, one must praise Yao and Shun"; "Words must be trustworthy." If "must speak" is reversed to become such "speak must," then the world will truly be at peace!

### Late Night Soliloquy

— Liu Lan

Life and education have shaped me into a somewhat reserved person, which has brought me countless long and dark days. The door to happiness seems to be permanently closed to me, and I have never found the key to open paradise. In the shadow of sentimentality, I live alone, and my childhood world is decorated with extreme coldness.

There is often a trace of sorrow planted deep in my heart, and a hint of melancholy locked in the depths of my soul, but I always keep them tightly sealed, preventing others from peeking. In fact, it is for the sake of others. I know that happiness is not easily shared, but sorrow can be easily infected. So why add to people's troubles?

In the quiet midnight, I ponder in silence, finally opening the brocade box of memory, like a wealthy guest, playing with the jewelry of the past. Unfortunately, most of them are dull and colorless, without dazzling brilliance. I flip through them again and again, but in the end, I cannot help but sigh and quietly put them away.

When I reach old age, when I am about to reach the end of my life, it would be so sad to look back on the road I have taken and find it so desolate and lonely, I think. I have neither rolled around in storms nor entered and left in the flames of war, but have only been trapped in my personal quagmire, doing a few somersaults. Is human life so ordinary, and is my life going to end just like this? I ask.

Optimists say, "The world is a stage, and life is a drama." But I disagree with this view. Destiny is kneaded in our own hands, and people are not destined to play certain roles. But I am often destroyed by pain, enduring the grinding of time, and the yawns and sighs in the courtyard take away my youth.

The words of a friend strike my mind like lightning: "The fate that lies before our generation of young people is tragic enough. Like myself, I have suffered from the destruction of feudal forces since I was very young, planting a negative mentality, and I have long understood sadness and sorrow. But now I am resisting fate, accompanying everyone in striving for the liberation of the nation. Struggle is painful, but it also has joy. Difficult destiny will increase our spirit of non-compromise. Quickly raise your fighting arm and hold up the banner of resistance." I begin to try to raise that arm—I feel heavy, but in the end, I will finally raise it, right?

In the distance, a cock crows, and dawn is approaching.

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

Hepu Town has fallen. After the fall of Hepu Town, the first person to become active was Tu Dong Yang Yue Liang. He felt that now was the time for him to regain his lost position and rise to replace Town Chief Chen. Fortunately, he was divinely inspired to paste a piece of red paper on a white bamboo cloth, which he actually made into a flag. He then led a few shady characters, calling himself a representative of the "Maintenance Society," and, carrying the flag, came out to welcome the X Army.

He was confident that in this way, the position of chairman of the "Maintenance Society" would surely fall into his hands. Who knew that One-Eyed Li glanced at him from the side, whispered a few words to the translator, and the translator said a few more words to a monkey-faced officer named Ali Ada. The officer glared and shouted, and several X Army soldiers grabbed him like eagles grabbing chickens. Yang Yueliang was so scared that he kept shouting "Innocent!" One-Eyed Li smiled coldly and ordered him to lead the way to capture the entire family of Commander Ye.

Commander Ye's entire family had already boarded a boat, and at this moment, with a favorable wind and water, they were already ten miles away. One-Eyed Li, unable to vent his anger, ordered his men to set fire to Commander Ye's house, burning it to the ground.

As if it had become a convention, whenever the × Army arrived at a place, they would carry out a large-scale burning, killing, raping, and looting. Now that Hepu Town had fallen into their hands, it was naturally impossible to escape this calamity. Thus, the idyllic paradise of Hepu Town quickly turned into a dark and gloomy hell, and the civilians who had not escaped all tasted the unprecedented suffering of the human world.

Yang Yueliang was taken back to his own home. His high-rise building, although spared from the shelling, was occupied as the headquarters of the X Army. At this time, he not only dared not harbor the illusion of becoming the chairman of the "Maintenance Society," but he did not even want to reclaim his house. He only hoped that the X Army would be merciful and release him, so that he could find a way to transport the silver hidden in his house and escape to another place, to live a peaceful life.

Who knew that even this minimum hope would not be satisfied. One-Eyed Li, as soon as he opened his mouth, demanded that he pay 100,000 yuan to the X Army as military expenses. (33)

Spring and Autumn

### Afraid of the Little Wife

— Fo

Nothing much to talk about, let's talk about being afraid of the little wife. "This place only discusses romance, it is okay to sleep and smoke cigarettes." In this day and age, in addition to dusting one's shoulders off, sleeping, and eating, practicing the three major principles, please don't say anything. "Eat more, talk less" is originally the philosophy of life for preserving oneself wisely, seeking good fortune and avoiding bad fortune. If you don't know what's good for you and still want to talk nonsense, maybe you will commit the sin of erotic thoughts like in Dream of the Red Chamber, so it is okay to talk about the way of husband and wife.

The day before yesterday, I saw a topic on the supplement of a certain newspaper, "Afraid of the Wife," but because smoking a cigarette was important, I didn't read the article carefully, which is a pity. This topic is quite interesting. I think wives can always be talked about, it doesn't violate the laws of the boudoir, and being afraid of the wife is even more okay, but the topic seems too outdated. In fact, it is not outdated. There is heaven and then there are all things, there are all things and then there are men and women, there are men and women and then there are husband and wife. Since the establishment of the rites of the Duke of Zhou, the system of husband and wife has been established, and "the three cardinal guides and the five constant virtues, the grand classics of propriety," have been established as an immutable law for thousands of years, so before the rites of the Duke of Zhou are abolished, it is still worth talking about.

Within the family, the republican system cannot be implemented, and fascism arises in response to the trend. It is either the husband's autocracy or the wife's tyranny. Being afraid of the wife and seeking quiet is originally a virtue of obeying the wife's authority in the family. The principle of the three obediences and four virtues does not necessarily belong to women, but also applies to men. Recently, women's rights are rampant and they are still singing that they are not men's playthings, which is really a injustice. Men are really women's playthings, how can women be men's playthings! Since the beginning of history, I don't know how many anecdotes about being afraid of the wife have been spread. The ancient teachings say, "If there is a virtuous wife in the family, the husband will not suffer misfortune." Assuming that a man can obey his wife's orders in everything, even if it doesn't mean that you have to be afraid of your wife to get rich, it will guarantee that you will be broad-minded and happy in everything. I think this saying is extremely reasonable. Assuming that a man is not afraid of his wife, he is really hopeless. The men I fear most are those who gesticulate at home, act recklessly, and treat their wives like servants, the so-called "fierce at the threshold," but when they go out, they dare not speak up to friends and relatives, and bow their heads in submission. I despise this kind of person the most. On the contrary, those who obey every order at home, prostrate themselves under high heels, greatly fearing their wives, but when they go out, no one buys their account, the so-called "subjected to one person, superior to ten thousand," this kind of person is worthy of admiration.

I very much agree with being afraid of the wife, but I absolutely do not agree with being afraid of the little wife. Between husband and wife, there must have been mutual love, and there must have been vows of eternal love. Now, seeing the old and faded wife and the flamboyant little wife, they go to favor the little wife and put the old wife out of their minds, even listening to the little wife and abusing the original wife, the so-called "only seeing the new person smile, not hearing the old person cry," evolving into a tragedy of favoring concubines and abusing wives. Such facts are often seen in society, how can it be said? Therefore, I do not approve of being afraid of the little wife, but I greatly approve of being afraid of the old wife.

### A Record of the Jingwu Athletic Association

— Simon

Established for thirty years, with tens of thousands of members, a wide range of activities, and also established academic classes, etc.

We all know that there is a Jingwu Athletic Association in Shanghai. Before the outbreak of the war, at grand commemorative festivals and amusement parks, we would sometimes see male and female members of the Jingwu Athletic Association performing martial arts, and their profound attainments had unique features. Recently, the Jingwu Athletic Association is recruiting members again; therefore, I want to write about the general situation of the association below:

The Jingwu Athletic Association was established two years before the Republic of China. However, in the short history of thirty years, it has expanded from Shanghai to various provinces, and even the South Seas Islands have branches. The number of members has expanded from a few to tens of thousands. The development of the association can be said to be very rapid, right? In the past thirty years, it has held nineteen large-scale member solicitation conferences, and this recruitment is the thirtieth time.

The main goal of the Jingwu Athletic Association is to enable people in general professional circles to pay a small membership fee and have the opportunity to exercise their bodies, sweeping away the nickname "sick man of East Asia," which is a very good intention. We only need to see that the members of the association, whether male or female, who study martial arts, all have strong bodies, and it is not difficult to see what kind of contributions the association has made to the country and the nation in the past thirty years.

Anyone who joins the Jingwu Athletic Association as a member can enjoy all the facilities of the association, such as bathrooms, libraries, billiard rooms, various indoor sports, and outdoor sports. Renting dormitories can also reduce the rent, and joining various research-oriented academic associations can also reduce membership fees. They can also participate in various group activities, such as travel and visits. Before "August 13th," the headquarters of the Jingwu Athletic Association was on North Sichuan Road. To make it convenient for general members, several branch associations were set up in Nanshi, Zhabei, and the central concession, so that members could practice Taijiquan and various martial arts and national arts nearby. However, after "August 13th," North Sichuan Road became a dead city, and the headquarters of the Jingwu Athletic Association moved to the upper floors of the mainland market—Cishu Building—so that the association's affairs would not be interrupted.

The current headquarters is the former branch association in the Special Zone, on the third floor of the mainland market. Although the location is not large, if you walk in, you can see many young people playing table tennis, playing billiards, and chatting there. There is also a place, a long and narrow side, with some thick carpets and weapons piled on the floor, which is where members practice national arts every morning. In the big city, there is luxury and debauchery everywhere, and this corner of the market has such a group that exercises the body and mind of young people, which people who have not been there do not know, right?

In the eyes of the general public, perhaps the Jingwu Athletic Association is a group concentrated on martial arts, but the fact is not so. The Jingwu Athletic Association currently has a wide range of activities, including national arts classes, Taijiquan research groups, wrestling classes, Western boxing classes, table tennis teams, tennis teams, swimming teams, libraries, Mandarin Sunday classes, Mandarin crash courses, Chinese shorthand classes, calligraphy classes, drama classes, Peking opera classes, Cantonese opera classes, and cartoon classes. It can be seen that this group emphasizes both literary and martial arts, and not only advocates martial arts, but also activities in various aspects such as sports, language, and art, and members who join can join the above various classes according to their personal preferences to study everything!

Scene Ten

(Four flag bearers enter, followed by four armored soldiers, sounding Jiang lips, announcing their names) We are Zhang Xian, Wang Gui, Xu Qing, and Niu Gao. Greetings! The marshal ascends the tent, and we are here to serve on either side. (The adjutant enters, followed by Yue, leading) With unwavering loyalty, we protect the magnificent land of the Song Dynasty. (Opening verse) Courage soars through the heavens, vowing to repay the emperor's debt. Eliminating the Yuan villains to restore the imperial carriage, I seek no grand title. I am Yue Fei, Military Commissioner of Qingyuan, Regional Pacifier of Hubei Road Jingxiang Tanzhou, and Viscount of Wuchang County. Jin Wuzhu has joined forces with Liu Yu, and they have already seized Luzhou. His Majesty has bestowed a personal edict, ordering me to lead troops to recover it. Now, encamped outside Luzhou City, I challenged the Jin soldiers earlier, but they kept their gates tightly shut and ignored me. What is to be done? (Xiao Sheng enters with four henchmen, singing) Through wind and dust, we hasten forward, unknowingly arriving at Yue's camp. (Speaks) I am Fan Xizhou. I heard that Yue's army is encamped outside Luzhou City, so I traveled thousands of miles with my brothers. Fearing General Han's pursuit of the remaining Fan clan members, I changed my name to He Chengxin and came to offer my services! Who's at the gate? (Adjutant) Who is causing a commotion here? (Xiao Sheng) We are here to join the army. (Adjutant) Reporting, there are those seeking to join the army outside the gate. (Yue) Bring them into the tent. (Adjutant) You are summoned into the tent, be cautious! (Xiao Sheng) Understood! (Says with henchmen) Greetings, Marshal. (Yue) Rise. You have come to join the army? (Xiao Sheng) Indeed. (Yue) What skills do you possess? (Xiao Sheng) I, He Chengxin, can scale walls and climb ladders. Even a hundred-foot city wall can be scaled in an instant, taking the enemy by surprise. These are my trusted confidants, who have all learned my skills and are brave and skilled in battle. I beg you to accept us. (Yue) You have come at the right time. Here is a command arrow. I order you to climb the city wall at the third watch tonight and open the gate to welcome our army, without fail. I will send troops to assist you. After the success, you will be promoted. (Xiao Sheng) Understood! (Exits with four henchmen) (Yue) Wang Gui, listen to my command! He Chengxin is newly arrived, and although his appearance seems honest, there may be deception. Therefore, I order you to dispatch a small team to assist He Chengxin in his success at the third watch tonight, thereby monitoring him, without fail! (Wang) Understood! (Exits) (Yue) Niu Gao, Xu Qing, listen to my command! I order you to be the vanguard, leading two thousand soldiers, to attack Luzhou City at the third watch. (Niu, Xu) Understood! (Exits) (Yue) Zhang Xian, listen to my command! I order you to lead two thousand soldiers and lie in ambush in the Shouzhou area to ambush the enemy soldiers. (Zhang) Understood! (Exits) (Yue) Close the gate. (Music plays, Yue exits with four flag bearers and adjutant)

Scene Eleven (Jin Wuzhu and Liu Yu, wearing crooked hats and barefoot, enter) (Jin) Oh dear! I was sleeping soundly in the middle of the night when the Southerners descended from the sky. They opened the city gate, and a large army surged in. I don't know how many soldiers and weapons our army lost. I escaped from the city and managed to save my old life. Old Liu, how could you not have taken precautions? You deserve to die! (Liu) Yes, yes, yes! (Aside) If you haven't been a traitor, you don't know the suffering of being a traitor; once you've been a traitor, the grandson of a bitch wants to be a traitor again! Everything has gone wrong, so I deserve to be scolded. (To Jin) Next time, I will definitely be careful! (Jin) Heh heh! Being careful is already too late! Let's flee to Shouzhou for our lives. (Liu, aside) Let me also pay him a few compliments. (To Jin) Didn't Your Highness once say that you would reach Lin'an in seven days and annex China in three months? How could a small Luzhou be lost in an instant? (Jin) This – words cannot be spoken like that. We must make the Southerners kneel before us. Fighting for three or five years is not a problem, even ten or a hundred years, we must fight on. (Liu) Your Highness changes direction so quickly! (Xiao Sheng and henchmen rush in) Halt! Are you Jin Wuzhu and the puppet Liu Yu, who sells out the country for glory? Take my spear! (They fight, Jin and Liu flee, Xiao Sheng and henchmen chase after them. Xiao Sheng enters again) I chased and killed all the way, beheading more than eighty heads. Just as I was about to end the life of the chief culprit, they escaped. I must report back to the commander! (Exits)

### The Young Mistress's Fan

— Si Hua

Hua Xin Production, China United Distribution, Xin Guang Premiere. "The Young Mistress's Fan" is a very famous stage play, and like "Sunrise," it has been brought to the screen without embellishment amidst a shortage of scripts.

Although this is an early work, it does not address the most pressing issues we face today; however, the aspects it reflects still exist. Superficially, society seems to have undergone significant changes, but feudal dregs have not been eliminated! — Men destroying women's chastity while denouncing their lack of shame is still a common occurrence. Oscar Wilde wrote "The Young Mistress's Fan" with emotional, poignant, and satirical tones to refute this erroneous notion.

Does the character played by Lu Luming in the play deserve our scorn? Society will undoubtedly attack her extravagant lifestyle. However, Wilde points out that this is the selfishness of a male-dominated society and the cruel punishment inflicted on women. Why did Lu Luming run away? It was because of her husband's infidelity. She did not want an unfaithful husband and resolutely left for her own happiness. Then why didn't she become a virtuous woman after leaving her husband? It was not her own willingness to degenerate; it was society! — A group of devils surrounded her, forcing her to lead such an absurd life, like the characters played by Sun Jingyou and Guang Zhaoguan. They had mocked her, but then desperately demanded her company. She also wanted to improve herself, but the "reputation" created by feudal concepts prevented her from moving forward. For the sake of "reputation," her husband did not have the courage to take her back; for the sake of "reputation," she could not even be close to her own daughter. Isn't this the cruelty of feudal society?

Wilde wrote the character of Lu Luming with the greatest sympathy. When we see her unwilling to let her own daughter follow in her footsteps, enduring all the insults from her daughter, we are almost moved to tears.

The film adaptation of "The Young Mistress's Fan" is not much different from the stage version; even the era has not been changed.

The director has made much more progress than in "Feng Qiu Huang," which proves that the quality of the script is of great importance. I think the best scene he handled was when Lu Luming went to her daughter's banquet, entered, and naturally reached out to take Mei Xi's arm, followed by close-ups of everyone whispering, and then Mei Xi introduced Lu Luming to Yuan Meiyun (her daughter), and she collapsed dejectedly, her fan slipping from her hand. These shots were very provocative. As for the scene where Lu Luming persuaded Yuan Meiyun to go home, although it was very touching, it was ultimately due to the quality of the script. In small details, such as the scene where Lu Luming and Mei Xi talked in the garden, and the scene where Liu Qiong and Yuan Meiyun talked in the garden, the director seemed to want to prove that there were "visitors" in the garden, so there were extras walking behind the main actors; in fact, it was not necessary in the plot, and it detracted from the atmosphere.

Lu Luming's performance this time was very good, but her movements were still stiff. Yuan Meiyun's performance in the scenes after being awakened by Lu Luming was very lively. Mei Xi was only better in the scenes where he was hiding his contact with Lu Luming from Yuan Meiyun; some other scenes lacked flexibility. Liu Qiong and Chuan William also gave good performances.

### After the Rain, Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Six: Praising One Person as a Talent, Three Talents Rising Together; Narrating Friendship, Two Gentlemen Meet with Heroes

It is said that Zhu Airen went to Suzhou and picked up the two young ladies, He Shuangyu and He Liyu, asking them whether they would stay in the Women and Children's Hospital or go to Freedom Village. The two young ladies discussed it and said, "We are willing to stay in your hospital. Although Freedom Village is quiet, you cannot accompany us, and it will make you worry about both places. Instead, you will have to come to Freedom Village to take care of us, which makes us uneasy. Staying in the hospital for a few days will also allow us to visit and see the hard work of your service. But don't let us disturb your work there." Zhu Airen said, "Although you are staying in the hospital, the place where we live is in a separate residence, but it is very close to the hospital. If you don't want to see patients, you don't have to see them. But our hospital is different from other hospitals. Other hospitals are of course full of patients. Although we are called a hospital, most of the people inside are not patients. Think about how a pregnant woman is not a patient, and the babies born are not patients. Although some pregnant women are sick and some babies are sick, those who are well cared for are in the minority. Especially those babies, it is really lovely to see them. If you see those little angels, you will also find them lovely. Since that is the case, you should stay in the hospital for a few days first, and then go to Freedom Village for a few days. Because we also want to set up a small branch in Freedom Village." He Liyu said, "That would be great! But we are afraid that we will disturb your work after we come." Zhu Airen said, "Definitely not! My work also has a fixed time. I start inspecting the wards and the pregnant women's rooms at 9:00 a.m. and finish around 11:00 a.m. In the afternoon, I go to inspect the nurseries and the children's wards at 2:00 p.m. and finish around 4:00 p.m. There are many gaps in between, and I can come to accompany you, and I also come back to the mansion to eat, so how can it hinder my work? But when I am working, you are free to play and do not necessarily need me to accompany you." From Suzhou to Freedom Village, or to Zhu Airen's Women and Children's Hospital, there is a very good highway. These highways have a wide and solid surface. Because Suzhou has a highway bureau that is responsible for the highways everywhere, and if there is any damage, it is repaired immediately. This place is called a water town, so naturally there are many bridges along the way. Many of them are highways built before the war, and the bridges are not very strong. Now, all the newly built bridges and those that have been repaired and rebuilt have been replaced with iron bridges, in order to make it a permanent solution. (61)

### Thoughts on Watching a Movie

— Yu Tang

It was the anniversary of the death of the Premier, and the weather was lovely. The car passed by a newly opened movie theater, and a huge half-mast flag was flying on the roof, making a loud noise in the wind. A large "Sold Out" sign was already hanging at the entrance, but people were still pouring in like a tide, revealing a contradiction that often made people feel both amused and sad. "O distressed people – don't hesitate, quickly find a comfortable seat. Watching a movie once in a while is not a heinous crime," I consoled myself and strolled into Nanjing.

The film was "Miracle of Love," starring Leon Baramu and Liu Yali Si, which tells the story of how a young doctor used heart medicine in addition to medicine to heal a woman's heartache. I don't want to describe the story in detail here, wasting space. Although I am satisfied with the acting skills of several leading actors, I can't write any film reviews because I am not an expert. On the one hand, because this film tells a story that is similar to my profession, I had two thoughts after watching it.

First, European and American films strive to be realistic when describing characters, places, and props of a particular profession. Places such as hospitals, train stations, post offices, and police stations, and all related characters and props, are not neglected even in the most minor details. In this regard, domestic films should admit that they are far behind. Leaving aside other things, take the hospitals that can often be seen in films. In the past, the hospital scenes in several domestic films were not only crude and simplified, failing to be realistic, but even the clothing and movements of the doctors and nurses inside, as well as the medical props, were full of errors. To the general public, perhaps as long as they see someone wearing a white coat, they think they are a doctor, and someone wearing a white hat, they think they are a nurse. And putting a few flasks and test tubes randomly, they think they are a laboratory, but in the eyes of experts, it is inevitable to find many inexcusable irrationalities. In order to improve the level of domestic films, I hope that directors will not be ashamed to ask questions and hire an expert in that profession for consultation when they encounter descriptions of places, characters, and props of a particular profession. Because a film is not only for thousands of people to watch, but also needs to be prepared to open up the foreign market, it should not be a laughing stock.

Second, what this film reveals to the audience is that a doctor should put diagnosis first and treatment second when seeing a patient. Before a definitive diagnosis is made for a disease, one should not make wild guesses or prescribe medicine indiscriminately to please the patient. Because most patients do not seek accurate diagnosis, but only seek prompt treatment. Like the intern in this film, because he was willing to focus on this point, he won the favor of a famous diagnostician. Although he offended the dean and lost the favor of the patient because of this, the expert was willing to pass on his life's skills to him alone, and said that even among a thousand doctors, it is difficult to cultivate a diagnostician. There are many people in the medical community who have seen this film, and hearing this should make many people feel ashamed.

### Entertainment Tidbits

Xin Ji Great Stage's new drama, "Thirty-Three Chapters of Journey to the West," features the performance of Zhang Yipeng, with "Hitting Wan Nianchun with a Head-On Blow" as the main act. Now, the segment of the Plum Blossom Demon advocating the Northern School has been added. The content depicts the Plum Demon bewitching the people and Wan Nianchun worshiping her as a godmother, colluding with each other. They are eventually eliminated one by one by Sun Wukong. The plot is in full swing, and the scriptwriter Zhang Baiyun is currently working on it.

Gu Naigen of the Tianchan Stage will establish an advertising department to promote the theater's affairs, and will hire twenty consultants to guide everything. Preparations have already begun. Zhang Erpeng, the martial arts actor of the Carde Grand Theater, has been very popular with the audience since he performed the entire "Yue Yun." Erpeng is now rehearsing the sequel to "Yue Yun," which will be performed in the coming days. He will leave the theater at the end of this month when his contract expires.

During the rest period of the Japanese performances at the Gong Stage, the child actor Xiao Xiaoshentong (i.e., Ma Jinlin) is learning from the civil and martial arts actor Li Ruilai. After Li taught him the play "Phoenix Mountain," he is now teaching him the play "Killing the Four Gates." The actor is practicing very diligently.

Yesterday, the Taishan Cantonese Opera Troupe continued to perform at the Empress Theater, with mediocre business. Now, Dong Tianwei of the Xingxing Film and Drama Society is in contact with Yang Hongzhi, the owner of the theater, to have the Chunchan Drama Society, which is run by the society, perform plays at the theater every Saturday and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. The terms have been agreed upon, and a trial performance will be held first on Sunday (the 19th).

Anyone who has seen "If I Were King" and "The Private Life of Louis XIV" will probably never forget the superb acting skills of the leading actor, Colman. Colman will soon star in a historical film about the life of Lord Kitchener of England, a general who led the British army against a powerful enemy during the European War in 1914. The female lead has not yet been selected, because this is a pure action film, and the female lead's position is not very important.

Old comedian Charlie Chaplin is already fifty years old this year. His birthday is on April 2nd, and although the date is still far away, the gifts sent to him by movie fans from all over the world have already piled up like mountains. It is expected that his birthday celebration will be very lively!

Shirley Temple's new film "The Little Princess" is about to be completed. The production company has promised her a reward of US$100,000. Shirley plans to take a trip to England immediately after filming.

Hollywood has recently planned to shoot several detective films with the London Scotland Yard as the theme. In order to make them realistic, except for the unimportant interior scenes, which will be filmed in Hollywood, the rest will be filmed directly in England. It is expected that the required capital will be very large.

Little Fan Pengke will star in "The Three Musketeers" by French writer Alexandre Dumas. The actors must have the ability to jump and run. Playing such a role will surely give the audience great satisfaction.

### Shanghai Drama Society's Public Performance of "Marriage"

### Liang Sisters Compete as Emperors and Empresses in Singapore for Advertising

— (Ge)

After the Liang Saizhen and Saizhu sisters left Hong Kong to dance in Singapore, we received a report from a friend saying that the sisters' business is very prosperous, and the number of people who admire their cheongsams is increasing day by day. Recently, the New World Dance Hall, to which the two sisters belong, hosted an advertising costume dance competition. More than forty businesses participated, each represented by a dancer, wearing specially made costumes of the businesses they represented, holding a beauty contest and competing for the championship. The Liang sisters represented the Singapore Star Island Daily, wearing costumes with the demeanor of crowned emperors and empresses. Baozhen played the empress, wearing a crown made of the newspaper's star emblem, wearing a white brocade robe, with a red ribbon on her shoulder, with the words "Star Island Daily" in English inlaid with white gemstones. She was dignified and gorgeous, just like an empress. Because Baozhu had a masculine air, she dressed as an emperor, wearing an exquisite crown, wearing a purple imperial robe, with a red ribbon on her shoulder, with the words "Star Island Daily" in Chinese inlaid with white gemstones. She wore gold-painted leather shoes, looking like a Western supreme ruler. Behind the two of them, there were more than ten feet of tassels, inlaid with gold stars. At the end of the tassels, four Indian children, wearing military uniforms and white scarves, each with a gold star inserted on their heads, supported the emperor and empress's tassels. When the entire line was arranged, it was a grand sight. Before the competition started, the dance party continued as usual, with many guests. The Liang sisters had already absorbed the attention of all the dancers in the audience. After the competition, the Liang sisters sang a song each to entertain the guests, and there was a roar of cheers. The dancers were as if they were in a dream.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (120)

— Xu Muyun

The "Chain of Plots" is a group performance in martial arts plays.

The Yellow family's miscalculation was not the end of the story. The imperial horse was never returned, and when the deadline arrived, the entire Tianba family was sentenced to be beheaded. Even if Tianba was lucky enough to defeat Dou Erdun, if he returned to the mountain and killed the imperial horse, fleeing far away and not fulfilling his promise to go to the capital to file a lawsuit, then the entire Tianba family would still not survive. Guangzu thought about it and devised a brilliant plan to steal the knife and the hook, making Dou Erdun voluntarily surrender due to his virtue and awe. He could not figure out how high Tianba's skills were, so he could peacefully resolve the situation and save the lives of the entire Tianba family. This shows his careful consideration, especially his courageous character. Tian Shuang was extremely fortunate to have such a good assistant. At the same time, it allowed people today to value the word "righteousness" more.

When Yang Xiaolou was in his prime, I saw him perform this play with Li Dezhong as Dou Erdun, and Wang Changlin as Zhu Guangzu. Both Li and Wang were versatile characters, and their singing, speaking, and acting were extremely skilled. There were several very good moves in "Stealing the Horse" and "Stealing the Hook." In his later years, Xiaolou used Jin Shaoshan and Hao Shouchen as Dou Erdun, and Wang Changlin taught Xiaoshan to play Zhu Guangzu. Although Jin and Hao had bright voices, one was too ethereal and the other was too fiery, and neither of them had a foundation in martial arts, so they were naturally not as good as Li's down-to-earth performance. Bian Shidengyang, who taught Xiaoshan, was an amateur who became a professional, but he did work very hard after joining Changlin's school and received Wang's true teachings. After Changlin passed away, he was considered the best martial arts clown, but unfortunately, he died of hemoptysis four years ago at the age of only fifty-something. Now, there are still people who can perform "Chain of Plots" in the semi-pure and two-row roles, but there is a real lack of talent for the opening and jumping roles. Wang Fushan is Wang Changlin's son, but his abilities are too mediocre, not as good as Ye Shengzhang in the north or Lu Qingyuan in the south. Ma Fulu had been working hard to practice martial arts a few years ago, and he could perform a few martial arts clown plays in the future, but he was not persistent. He was too fond of mahjong when there were no plays, which was also because he was too popular, too lazy, and had too much income, so he did not seek to improve. I really hope that he can do well and not be arrogant because of his popularity. He is likely to be the choice for a versatile civil and martial arts clown in the future.

### Securities Market for Public Bonds Expands; Prices See Rebound Yesterday

The securities grey market saw an upward trend again yesterday, transforming the situation. Those who sold on the 20th the day before yesterday actually turned to buying yesterday. Only Dafeng & Co. showed some activity on the bullish side, attracting some attention, but buyers still dominated. There was no significant news. The method for collecting cash is indeed a reality, but with some limitations. Most parties are unwilling to easily sell, resulting in a shortage of shares. Although market prices are bound to have some fluctuations, the upward trend may be unstoppable. The high prices of the previous days may easily be surpassed. In short, confidence is extremely strong, and the trend is more likely to rise than fall. The market scope is gradually expanding, and price fluctuations will naturally occur from time to time.

Yesterday's trading saw No. 5 and No. 35 buying in, and Lianhe & Co. also absorbed a considerable amount. On the selling side, No. 38, Tongkang & Co., and Dafeng & Co. sold relatively little. Retail investors also sold more than they bought. Before noon, prices were slightly better by 2.5 to 5.5 jiao. In the afternoon, No. 20 and No. 40 saw a surge in buying, with No. 20 maintaining its consistent style. No. 40 shared the same view as No. 20. Others such as No. 7 and Mai Da also made purchases. Dafeng & Co. still sold the most, and Fuda also sold a considerable amount. Retail investors still sold more than they bought, and because demand exceeded supply, prices continued to rise slowly but steadily. Series Wu broke through the 50 yuan barrier again, and prices improved by another 3 jiao. The final result was slightly better by 5.5 to 8.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.1 million. A concise table is listed below:

Bond Type  Highest  Lowest  Closing Price  Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 57.80  57.45  57.80  Up 0.60

Unified B 51.60  51.00  51.60  Up 0.85

Unified C 51.05  50.70  51.05  Up 0.55

### Finance Gold Prices Stable with a Weak Tone

Yesterday's spot gold grey market suddenly turned dull, lacking any excitement. The market hovered between 2,095 yuan and 2,098 yuan throughout the morning, mainly due to large investors watching. Although securities firms bought more than they sold in the middle, the market sentiment weakened due to the hard trend of foreign exchange, so cash dealers and some money exchange businesses successively sold, leading to a final weakening of the market price. However, in the afternoon, the securities firms suddenly wanted to buy back, but the buyers were scarce, so although the price was called down to the border of 2,090 yuan, it was still difficult to find a counterpart. As a result, the nominal drop was 2 yuan, but in reality, it fell by 8 yuan. The trading volume was not high throughout the day, about 500 taels in the morning, and nothing was done in the afternoon. Jewelry gold remained unchanged. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold consistently declined slightly.

### Spot Gold Only Slightly Down Two Yuan

From the morning, each bar of ten taels had no trading activity at first. It was not until 9:45 that securities firms sold 30 taels to money exchange businesses at an opening price of 2,097 yuan, one yuan lower than the previous closing price. After opening, securities firms suddenly stopped selling and aggressively bought, taking in 50 taels from money exchange businesses at the same price of 97 yuan. Another 50 taels each were taken in from jewelry stores and cash dealers at 98 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank also took in 50 taels from cash dealers at the same price. Shortly after, the potential trend of foreign exchange reported a hardening, so the bank immediately resold 50 taels to jewelry stores at 97 yuan. Money exchange businesses said they sold 50 taels to securities firms at 95 yuan. Later, securities firms suddenly resold 50 taels to jewelry stores at 97 yuan. In a moment, they bought back 50 taels from money exchange businesses at 95 yuan. Later, money exchange businesses traded 50 taels among themselves at 96 yuan. By this time, it was already past 11:30. After this, supply and demand became scarce, and the price remained stagnant. It extended to noon without any trading activity, so the closing price at noon was still 96 yuan. Although foreign exchange was quite stagnant in the afternoon, the securities firms suddenly wanted to buy back, and the price was directly called down to 90 yuan for sale, but it was still difficult to find a counterpart, so no trading was done. However, a certain money exchange business had few ins and outs in the retail market, with only dozens of taels sold to local customers at 91 yuan. Based on the noon closing price of 2,096 yuan, the result was a nominal drop of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The selling price of cash dealers' own brand gold was 2,100 yuan, and the buying price was 2,085 yuan. The current margin gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading activity.

### Jewelry Gold Exchange Price Unchanged

The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged. Datong Hang still suspended at 213 yuan, and Xintong Hang was still at 211 yuan, buying in at 205 yuan.

### Pure Gold Down Half a Penny

A London cable on the 13th stated that British pure gold shrank by half a penny per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 2 and a half pence. As a result, the Central Bank's Chinese cash buying price also dropped to 1,209 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold did not change, remaining at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also decreased by 4 jiao, reaching 1,205 yuan and 2 jiao.

### British Gold Pound Demand Still Strong

Yesterday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate did not move. The foreign exchange market was relatively stable at first, but the demand then became scarce. Hong Kong cables were thrown out quite a bit, and Jardine Matheson and Sassoon & Co. sold to make profits. Bank absorption was not smooth, and market prices tended to loosen. Afternoon trading was even scarcer, and the market was stagnant. Spot gold opened firm, but as foreign exchange loosened, gold dealers and money exchange businesses stopped in their tracks. Long positions were liquidated for profit, and the market tended to soften. In the afternoon, retail investors continued to sell, but buyers were very scarce, and it was difficult to find a counterpart. Trading was sparse, and the momentum was very weak. Foreign currency British gold pounds had strong demand, with wealthy people purchasing over 400 pieces. British-American gold notes were not actively absorbed, and trading was sparse. Various currencies slightly declined in small amounts. Association transactions were extremely rare, with only Chen Tai selling 500 US dollar notes for Huitong. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold notes rise by 5 fen, American gold pounds fall by 1 jiao, American dollar notes fall by 5 li, French francs fall by 5 hao, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Discount Rate Holds Steady

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts started high and returned at the end. Per 1,000 yuan, it once carried on the momentum from the previous day, reaching 51 yuan, but soon saw a return. At noon, it was 50 yuan and 2.5 jiao, and in the afternoon, it was 50 yuan, with no difference from the previous day.

### Sassoon and Jardine Matheson Sold, Foreign Exchange Turned Looser Again

Although "North China United Bank," Tianjin and Beijing speculators, and major foreign firms were buying in the foreign exchange market yesterday, Western banks were willing to supply, and Western firm Sassoon, Chinese firms, and Jardine Matheson & Co. started selling, leading to a slight loosening of potential. However, there were few changes in the middle, and trading turned quiet. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, supply and demand were evenly matched, with no difference.

At the start of the morning, the London big bar silver was unchanged in the near and far term, and the New York silver price also remained stagnant. London's raw gold shrank by half a penny, the British-American exchange rate was large at 9 hao, the British-French rate rose by 3 centimes, the British-Shanghai rate dropped by 0.0625, the American-British rate was still level, the American-French rate increased by 0.0625, and the American-Shanghai rate fell by 8 fen. The central listed rates for various exchanges remained the same. The banks' opening selling prices in the morning were 8 pence and 265625 for British exchange and 16 yuan and 15625 for American exchange, with no difference from the previous closing. After opening, foreign firms first came to settle with HSBC, Chartered Bank, and Banque Belge pour l'Étranger for British exchange at 8 pence and 25, and also for American exchange at 16 yuan and 125, showing a slight softening. The HSBC listing and the announcement of the silver equalization tax showed no increase or decrease. After this, although "North China United Bank" and Tianjin and Beijing speculators secretly bought in, Western firms Sassoon, Chinese firms, and Jardine Matheson & Co. vigorously sold, leading to a loosening of the downward trend. Sassoon, Jardine Matheson & Co., and Chinese firms sold favorable British exchange to foreign banks at 8 pence and 265625, and American exchange at 16 yuan and 1875. Subsequently, Sassoon sold favorable British exchange to foreign banks at 8 pence and 296875. At that time, the American exchange rate also hardened to 16 yuan and 21875. Near noon, Chinese firms sold Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms at 55 yuan and a half, and the trend gradually flattened. The banks' selling prices at noon were 8 pence and 28125 for British exchange and 16 yuan and 1875 for American exchange.

The situation in the afternoon market was quiet, with only foreign firms settling with HSBC for British exchange at 8 pence and 28125. Later, a certain bank settled for American exchange with Banque Belge pour l'Étranger at 16 yuan and 1875, so the situation was quite stagnant. Extending to the late close, the banks' selling prices were 8 pence and 28125 for British exchange and 16 yuan and 1875 for American exchange. As a result, compared to the previous day, British exchange loosened by 0.015625, American exchange increased by 0.03125, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was unchanged.

### Indian Silver Weak, British Silver Level

A London cable on the 13th stated that the silver market was quiet and stagnant. After closing, there were only a few purchases according to the listing. The big bar silver was unchanged in the near and far term. The New York silver and American silver prices remained stagnant. A Bombay cable stated that Indian silver was weak in the current term, with the spot price unchanged, and the near and far terms shrank by 3 annas.

### Grains Japonica and Indica Rice Hoarders Both Sell

Market Prices Slightly Down Two or Three Jiao

Yesterday's source of rice, including the river and lower reaches, arrived on the 14th, with 6,000 to 7,000 packages transported by car. Since the overall situation turned lax, the arrival of rice yesterday was exuberant, and confidence grew weaker. Hoarders mostly launched sales, leading to a lower market, but there were many who took advantage of the low prices to pull in. However, the appetite was particularly harsh. As a result, the prices of both northern and southern japonica rice and thin rice all fell by two or three jiao. The decline in river and lower reaches rice was particularly severe, with a continued decline of four or five jiao. Except for Du Yangjian's scarce goods, which depreciated slightly by a jiao, the prices of port spikes also fell by two or three jiao due to the influence of guest spikes. Yuan hoarders also sold back, resulting in a cut of more than three jiao.

The guest indica rice market has entered the right track, with clear distinctions between high and low grades. Guest hoarders feared further losses and sought to sell, while actual sales were weak on both local and guest sides, and the market declined by two or three jiao. After the decline, the local demand for guest rice was still active, so the transaction volume was over 2,000 packages. Top-grade Nanjing indica rice only opened at 13.10 yuan, with large market Beijing indica and high Wu indica uniformly opening at 13 yuan, and mid-grade Wu indica already lowered to 12.12 yuan.

Yesterday, 3,300 packages of rice arrived from Hong Kong and were transferred to Tianjin.

### Flour Domestic Sales Suddenly Rise

Flour guest dealers' transactions had no special development, but scattered sales were still active. Northern gangs were restrained by foreign flour and did not make large purchases. Southern gangs also disliked the high prices, and transactions were not exuberant. However, yesterday, Changzhou and Wuxi in the inland suddenly came to Shanghai to purchase flour, because the local population gradually increased, and the demand was more complex, and confidence was also boosted a lot. The overall market was managed by northern and southern gangs and inland gangs, each handling 20,000 to 30,000 packages. Local retail sales were about 7,000 packages. No. 2 flour mill price was 4.70 yuan, and No. 3, No. 4 flour, and miscellaneous brands of flour were slightly different, and the market gradually became stable. Yesterday, 8,000 packages of exported flour were transported to Yantai, 7,000 packages to Tianjin, 3,000 packages from Hong Kong were transferred to Tianjin, and 5,000 packages were transferred to Yantai. Today, there are still 22,000 packages of flour and 2,000 bags of bran to be transported to Shantou.

In addition to a newly arrived ship of factory-set foreign wheat, the source of the wheat market still felt lacking. Because each producing area was controlled by a certain party, the source of whole tickets was almost hopeless. The sales channels of each factory have also invisibly stopped. Yesterday, it was heard that about one or two hundred packages were sent to the factory, priced at 6.80 yuan to 7 yuan. Due to the high grade of wheat, the selling price was slightly different. Transactions in the official market still had no single package traded.

### Yarn Cotton Yarn Production Seems Surplus, Multiple Parties Try Hard to Raise Prices: Ultimately Difficult to Sustain

The yarn market initially rose and then weakened, and the trend still did not deviate from the hovering state, because actual demand was not smooth. The factory output greatly increased compared to before, because the newly created small-scale model factories had already started production, so based on the market situation, there was a daily feeling that supply exceeded demand. Although multiple parties tried their best to maintain and raise prices, they were ultimately difficult to stabilize, but the idea of general wealthy people absorbing was not cut off. There were many who came to pull in on a fall, and there were also many who spit out on a rise, so the force of rotation was extraordinarily tenuous. In the afternoon, buyers became active again, and the market image turned better again. This state can be said to be like this every day, with mornings being weak and the market returning to stability in the afternoon, with an increase of one or two yuan.

In the current yarn situation, the morning opening price carried on the strong momentum of the previous afternoon, and the market called out uniformly higher prices, with the opening price increasing by 5 jiao. The price of 20-count Tiannv was 395 yuan, but the opening price of Shuangma was the same as the previous day. After a short time, a certain party came to sell again. At the same time, the guest dealers' business was not exuberant, and the market price suddenly tended to decline, decreasing step by step. The price of 20-count Shuangma was 391 yuan, and the warehouse receipt was done at 388 yuan, a drop of 3.5 yuan compared to the opening price. Then, taking advantage of the low price, buyers came in again, and it rebounded slightly. By the closing price, Shuangma was 392 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 389 yuan. In the afternoon, inland gangs had some needs, but when buying yarn from Zhenhua Factory, multiple parties came to take action, and the market state was slightly higher. It remains to be seen what will happen tomorrow morning, and then the actual demand will be used as the basis for advancement and retreat. The statistics of the total purchase volume of various gangs throughout the day were 2,060 packages, and the market price of 20-count Shuangma fell by one yuan compared to the previous day. Other yarn markets also showed weakness. Zhenhua Factory opened 160 packages of 16-count Shuanglong at 315 yuan, and 150 packages of 12-count Shuanglong at 312 yuan smoothly. Yesterday, 60 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Yantai, 290 pieces to Tianjin, and today there are still 250 pieces to be transported to Shantou and 60 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount of transactions for each gang is recorded on the left:

Same Trade 1,305  Shantou 10

Inland 370  Xiamen 15

Sichuan 60  Hong Kong 60

Wenzhou 140  Tianjin 50

Jiangxi 20  Ningbo 10

Yunnan 20  Total 2,060

The opening of the Japanese yarn market once saw a tense situation, jumping four or five yuan. It was said that the northern Tianjin gang had business, and confidence was strong. Then, long positions emerged, and it fell back again. As a result, it still rose by more than 2.3 yuan. The current yarn price for 20-count Suigetsu was 336 yuan, and the current yarn price for 20-count Blue Phoenix was around 329 yuan.

### Machine-Ginned Cotton Breaks Through the 70 Yuan Barrier

The local cotton business remained as dull as ever. The factory side had absolutely no action, because the goods were scarce, and the called price was particularly high, and it was rising step by step. New peaks emerged one after another. Machine-ginned cotton broke through the 70 yuan barrier again, reaching 70.075 yuan. Tongzhou cotton was still the same high price as the previous day. There was no source from northern Jiangsu. 3,600 packages of Yao cotton arrived. The current cotton trading is recorded on the left:

Tong Cotton 77.20 Yuan Xingde 600 Packages  Exchange

Dezi 89.00 Same Trade 200 Pieces  Again

Machine-Ginned 70.75 Again 200 Packages  Cash

Changyin 79.25 Again 500 Packages  Exchange

The market price of foreign cotton: New York opened in the morning and rose by one to three points. In the middle, it weakened due to the lack of new developments in agricultural legislation in Washington. Later, due to overseas cotton merchants purchasing and short covering, it closed at the highest price. As a result, it rose by two to eight points. The Indian cotton market was quite firm. Yesterday, including forecasts, it rose by another rupee. Yesterday, Indian cotton stopped trading for a day due to the death of a broker. However, according to the telegram received from Mahaqiang in the evening of the previous day, the white broach for April and May was 157 rupees, and Egyptian cotton fell by ten points. Yesterday, the exchange rate tightened, and the converted legal tender cotton prices all rose. American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 9 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by 4 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 8 jiao.

The Shanghai market for foreign cotton trading was extraordinarily quiet. Neither Chinese nor foreign factories had any transactions. Because yarn prices were depressed and the current transport of Indian cotton was difficult, they temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The cotton prices for yesterday are listed below:

Raw Materials Category  Delivery to Factory Including Tax

60-Count Egyptian Cotton High Grade 12.30

Again Again Medium Grade 108.40

80-Count Again High Grade 136.65

### Sugar Market Taikoo Crystal White Opens at 4,200 Bags, Negotiations for Green Raw Sugar Gradually Approaching

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The association's planned market for No. 24 Dutch coarse white was quoted at the original price, and the transshipped goods fell by 1.5 jiao, with more than 400 bags transacted at 16.5 yuan. Dutch red cargo was at 16.75 yuan, with dozens of bags planned out. The Taikoo crystal white market trend was more firm. Grade B cargo was still planned at 24.7 jiao, and futures rose by 5 fen, opening at 4,200 bags, with the price for immediate shipment at HK$9.45, and April at 9.55. The price negotiations for national sugar green raw sugar were gradually approaching, and hundreds of bags should be able to open today. More than a hundred bags of ordinary Shimen sliced green sugar opened at 11.8 jiao. The Jinan ship arrived with 700 pieces of Taikoo sugar, 583 bags of green sugar, and 160 bags of red sugar. Another 1,500 bags came from Holland.

### Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Beans Unanimously Soft

Yesterday, both future and spot yellow beans showed a soft trend. Due to seasonal factors, Du beans and sand yellow beans had weak arrivals and sales. Large-volume trading usually relied on car beans, but in this environment, they inevitably approached Lien beans. However, recently, the sales channel was slack and the market trend softened, so Lien beans were restrained. It is estimated that seven cars of Dalian beans will be delivered in April, priced at 8.30 yuan, a decrease of 2 fen compared to the previous market. On the spot market, the Guang gang purchased 500 packages of Chongming sand yellow beans at 8.50 yuan to 8.35 yuan, 70 packages of Pinghu medium-grain Du beans at 9.65 yuan, and one car of Dalian spot beans at 8.40 yuan. Yesterday, 11 tons of beans were transported to Singapore.

### Oil Cakes Spot Soybean Oil Rises Another 4 Jiao

Futures Cake Foreign Firm's Intention to Dump is Strong

The oil market still did not escape the rotation, and peanut oil was tight after first being flat due to unsettled confidence. 50 pieces of open warehouse oil were opened, with the price at the original market price of 29.2 jiao. 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 29 yuan and 30 yuan. Soybean oil had few arrivals and continued sales. Spot oil rose by 4 jiao, and futures oil turned up by two or three jiao under the addition of speculators. The overall market estimated the opening of 200 loads of spot oil from this factory, 100 pieces of Yanqi, 100 pieces of big and small baskets of Lianqi, 300 barrels of Dalian spot oil, 500 barrels of March futures oil, 100 barrels of March next, 1,300 or 400 barrels of April futures oil, and 50 barrels of 500 shares. Spot cake Ningbo gang bought 300 pieces of Dayou Wang brand cake, priced at 3.26 yuan, a rise of 2 fen. 1,000 pieces of inland Jiangbei small cake, the market was loose because the goods were abundant and the cargo holders were loose to sell, opening at the original market price of 6.1 fen. Dalian April and May futures cakes, the foreign firm's intention to dump was strong, and the hoarders took the opportunity to kill and enter, and the market fell by four or five fen compared to the previous market, opening 24,000 pieces at 3.15 yuan to 3.20 yuan.

### Piece Goods Fine Cloth Expensive

Coarse Cloth Steady

National cloth white goods, fine cloth, fine twill, and products from the Yong'an, Shenxin, and Xinyu factories, continued to have good demand from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi gang. The cheap and quick-handed goods on the market were gradually sold out. The factory market price of Shenxin Fugui fine cloth was 13 yuan, and fine twill was 12 yuan, insisting on not loosening, so the price of quick-handed goods was also sold tighter and tighter. Yesterday, the market price of fine cloth was 12.75 yuan to 12.9 jiao, and fine twill was 11.85 yuan to 9 jiao, with more than 200 pieces purchased by the bank gang and the Yongshaoou gang. Yong'an Dapeng fine cloth had a stock shortage, and few transactions were made. The sub-brand Red Dapeng sold at 13 yuan, a rise of 2 jiao compared to the previous market. The market price of Fugui fine cloth and fine twill rose by 1 jiao per piece in the later market. However, the products from the Tianjin Hengyuan Factory and various single-weaving factories had no increase or decrease in the selling price. Transactions of coarse cloth were light, and prices were flat. The selling price of bleached and dyed cloth had few changes. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi gang had a more complex need, and 300 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached material, poplin, foreign yarn, and colored cloth were transacted.

Dong cloth white goods rose in the morning and weakened in the afternoon, and the market trend has shown a turning point. The highest market price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth sold over 11.85 yuan per piece, and then returned to 11.8 yuan, Caiqiu 12 yuan, and Feiyu 11.9 yuan. The Tianjin gang entered more than 400 packages of fine cloth. The Qingdao gang entered a total of three or four hundred pieces in the past two days. The sale of dyed blanks on this street was still strong, and another 700 pieces were entered.

### Silk and Tea The Decline in Raw Silk Prices Comes to an End

The Shanghai Market's Confidence Gradually Stabilizes

The overseas silk market has seen a sharp decline in Japanese silk prices over the past two weeks. Spot silk prices have plummeted from 1,055 yuan directly to the 1,000 yuan mark, reaching 960 yuan (recorded in the morning market on March 11). This has had a significant impact on the American, French, and local markets, resulting in a situation where there were offers but no buyers. As of yesterday, silk prices in various ports gradually showed signs of stabilization, and it appears that the price decline has come to an end. Yesterday, Yokohama spot prices rebounded by 15 yuan, and forward prices rose by 9 yuan. New York spot prices opened at original levels for near-term contracts, while forward contracts rose by 2 cents. Most other Chinese and Japanese spot silk prices remained stable, with only Lyon showing continued weakness. Japanese silk prices fell by 3.5%, Shanghai silk A grade fell by 2.5%, and B grade fell by 2%.

The lowest price for Shanghai's White Factory B grade silk briefly returned to 1,720 yuan, but due to scattered transactions, it was difficult to record. Yesterday, confidence gradually stabilized. Although foreign and domestic sales are still not active, silk prices are already rising. British and French firms have made some inquiries, but few transactions have been concluded. The New York Shanghai silk price is still opening at $2.14, which is still about 100 yuan away from the Shanghai price. Yesterday, 30 bales of Indian silk were traded, with firm prices. No domestic sales were reported. Yesterday, 179 bales of Hu silk were shipped to Europe, and 11 tons of Japanese tea were shipped to London.

### Imports and Exports Significant Imports of Dutch Goods from Southeast Asia

Yesterday, 35,880 packages of beeswax, 3,000 packages of tapioca starch, 1,010 pieces of coconut oil (soap-making raw material), 1,420 pieces of teak planks, 650 boxes of rubber, 1,250 pieces of hide, and 116 barrels of kerosene were imported from the Dutch East Indies.

### Metals The Rising Trend of "Hui Si" Iron Has Not Weakened

Since the overseas price of 200-pound American "Hui Si" iron soared, buyers in the local market have been very crowded. The standard price has risen sharply, with old steel mills quoting 57 yuan per case and new steel mills selling for 56 yuan, both 1 yuan higher than the previous market. Recently, due to strong buying interest, even as overseas prices have softened, the rising trend has not weakened. Yesterday, there were transactions from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other regions. Local factories also made some sales, offering more than 500 cases. The market price in the local area was between 57 yuan and 57.67 yuan, while buyers from other regions were still offering 56.7 yuan. According to overseas prices, the recent price per case is 7.23 gold yuan, about 0.278 yuan lower than the previous price. It is rumored that some industry players have made deals, but only for a hundred tons or so.

### The Transformations of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce Over the Past Year

— Hui (Continued)

(5) Transfers of Ownership

Transfers of ownership in industry and commerce mostly occur when businesses are unable to sustain themselves or are unwilling to continue operating, while simultaneously, newcomers are interested and willing to take over. The result is the transfer of ownership. What distinguishes this from liquidation is that there is a successor, so the transfer of ownership is also a significant transformation in industry and commerce. Over the past year, there have been 873 such transfers of industrial and commercial firms. Of these, only 131 were factories, while 742 were commercial firms. Among the 873 transferred industrial and commercial firms, the food and beverage industry accounted for the most, with 298 firms. This is likely due to the abnormal development of consumer industries after becoming an isolated island! The next largest categories were clothing (117 firms) and daily necessities (116 firms). After becoming an isolated island, people from various regions considered it a haven, and the population grew continuously as a result, expanding compared to pre-war levels. Naturally, the demand for clothing and daily necessities was urgent, and these two industries thrived accordingly. Undoubtedly, the variations also increased. Next were the fuel and hygiene industries, each with 47 firms; metal and electrical, 43 firms; travel, 27 firms; medicine, 25 firms; culture, 22 firms; entertainment, 18 firms; transportation, 15 firms; decoration, 13 firms; construction, 10 firms; finance and public utilities, each with 5 firms; special industries, 2 firms; and 63 firms with unspecified industries.

Comparing the number of transfers of 873 industrial and commercial firms across different months, March had the highest number with 92 firms, followed by September with 86 firms, October with 80 firms, April and May each with 78 firms, June with 77 firms, December with 75 firms, November with 74 firms, July with 67 firms, June with 59 firms, August with 56 firms, and January at the bottom with 51 firms. This shows that the number of changes in each month follows the commercial season. A table listing the number of firms by industry for each month is shown below:
