Chongqing: All parts of China are overjoyed at the victory of the Chinese army in Changsha. A mass parade is being held here to celebrate the victory. Many Chinese people believe that this is the greatest victory of the Chinese side in the War of Resistance, and its importance and scope far exceed the victory of Taierzhuang. Today, military news received here claims that the Chinese army advanced several tens of miles in forty-eight hours in pursuit of the defeated Japanese army. News was also received here that the Japanese army is currently transferring elite units of the Kwantung Army from the three northeastern provinces to Hankou to reinforce. However, it is still unknown whether the Japanese army will decide to attack Changsha or begin to peep into Yichang. It is believed that the current stage of the Changsha campaign is about to end. Some details of the Chinese plan can now be disclosed. It is said that this plan was the result of careful preparation by some of China's most outstanding strategists. These strategists, with clever tactics and the strong morale of the Chinese army, achieved this extraordinary victory. When the Japanese army prepared to attack Changsha, the Chinese side deliberately announced that it would not fight east of the Yuehan Railway and would abandon Changsha. At the same time, the roads and railways near Changsha were systematically and thoroughly destroyed. The elite Chinese army units were stationed in the mountains east of the railway, and particularly strong units were concentrated north of Pingjiang. When the Japanese army moved south towards Changsha, they cut off the railway approaching the rear of the Japanese army and guarded the Chinese army near Dongting Lake and the railway front, moving into the mountains on both sides of the railway and road. When the Japanese army rushed towards Changsha, because the roads and railways had been destroyed by the Chinese army, they left heavy artillery and tanks behind and divided into small teams to rush towards Changsha. This rash action by the Japanese army soon proved to be very costly, as small teams of Japanese soldiers were ambushed and annihilated, and the main force was surrounded in the mountains. The Japanese army had to abandon the invasion of Changsha and flee back, while being attacked by the Chinese army along the way. Most of the Chinese army are from Hunan Province and are very familiar with the local situation and terrain. All circles of Chinese people here praised General Xue Yue, commander-in-chief of the Changsha battlefield, and General Guan Linzheng, commander of the forward troops. The Chinese Army's "Sweeping Report" criticized the situation of the war and said that victory was important economically. It is said that the area around the lakes and swamps in Hunan Province produces 120 million dan of rice and grains annually, and the food supply for the western and northwestern parts of China depends on this. (7th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing: Residents throughout the city set off firecrackers because of the great victory of the Chinese army in northern Hunan, and the sound resounded throughout the city. This great victory of the Chinese side has dealt a great blow to the Japanese army and shattered their dream of advancing westward. The Japanese side divided the attack on Changsha into three routes, and the momentum was fierce. At first, it was indeed a serious threat to Changsha. However, the Chinese side's front line from Pingjiang through Xinqiang, Miluo, Yingtian to Xiangyin can be counterattacked at any time, or strategically retreated at any time. Therefore, when the Chinese side waited for the Japanese army to rush into its frontal position, it withdrew strong troops to the mountains of the Mufu Mountains and made surprise attacks on the flanks of the southward Japanese army. At the same time, strong and powerful troops were left on the front to deal with them, cutting the Japanese army into countless small groups and annihilating them. According to the Chinese military authorities, the Japanese army's defeat this time was even worse than the defeat in central Hubei. One of the reasons for the Japanese army's defeat this time was that the left wing of the Japanese army acted too slowly. The left wing of the Japanese army originally departed from Xiushui Tonggu in Jiangxi, but because of unfavorable marching, it delayed the opportunity, giving the Chinese army ample time to solve the central and left Japanese armies. (7th Associated Press dispatch)

As a result of the Chinese army's counterattack, the Japanese army has suffered at least 10,000 casualties. (7th Reuters) Hengyang: All circles in Hunan Province believe that the Chinese army's great victory in northern Hunan and northern Jiangxi is of great importance to the overall war situation. All circles in Hunan Province have decided to hold a provincial celebration meeting on the 9th of this month and send telegrams to the whole country to hold it together. (7th dispatch)

A certain place in Hubei: A reporter from the Central News Agency paid a visit to General × in a certain place on the front line yesterday morning. Although the general was busy with military affairs, he received him and spoke frankly about the war situation. The general, with his transcendent strategy and ingenious calculations, led to this great victory in northern Hunan and northern Jiangxi. Now, with his permission, his remarks are published as follows: In March of this year, when the Chinese army was fighting in Nanchang and the situation in Hunan was tense, I reported on the military situation in the Changsha All Circles Joint Memorial Weekly and firmly pointed out two key points: (1) From a geographical point of view, Poyang Lake is in northeastern Jiangxi, and Dongting Lake is in northeastern Hunan. The Jiugong Mufu Mountains span the two provinces. From Nanchang to Jiujiang and from Changsha to Yueyang, they are all lake and swamp areas. The Japanese army entering deep into the hinterland is no different from throwing themselves into a trap. We can use the mountains and lakes to create a favorable situation for encircling and annihilating the Japanese army. (2) From the perspective of the overall war situation in the country, we are national revolutionary soldiers and will not worry about the sacrifice of all lives and property, and will not be afraid of the Japanese artillery fire invasion. Moreover, we are afraid that the Japanese will not come to invade Hunan and Jiangxi with heavy troops. The more the Japanese come to invade, the more opportunities we have to gather and annihilate the Japanese army. This is most beneficial to the overall situation of our national war of resistance. Sure enough, since the Japanese army occupied Nanchang, it has not only gained more than it lost militarily, politically, and economically, but has also been exhausted and at a loss for a long time. Until recently, the Japanese army suffered from international isolation and domestic anti-war strikes. At the same time, in view of the fact that they have continued to fight with the Chinese army in northern Hunan, southern Hubei, and northern Jiangxi for several months, they have not achieved any results and cannot survive. They had to make a final struggle to peek at Changsha. This time, the Japanese knew that if they did not concentrate heavy troops to attack Changsha, they would be wiped out. Therefore, starting from September 14, they dispatched six or seven divisions of the army and thousands of naval landing troops, and used a large number of Japanese aircraft and poison gas to launch a bloody battle with the Chinese army. The Chinese army soldiers sprinkled loyal and patriotic blood on the sacred land of national resistance, supporting every inch of the country's territory, and making the Japanese army pay the greatest price and inflict a major blow on the Japanese army. Now the Japanese army is blindly running around in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, trapped in a heavy siege, and it is no different from throwing themselves into a trap and speeding up their defeat and destruction. This is exactly a good opportunity for us to annihilate the Japanese army, and we will surely cause the Japanese army to suffer an unprecedented defeat. However, at this time, there are several important meanings that comrades and compatriots must pay attention to and rise up to implement. First, adhere to the national policy and strategy of resisting the war and building the country. The fundamental purpose of our war of resistance is to seek the eternal survival of the nation and to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. This sacred and arduous mission requires the unity of the whole country, the willingness to make the greatest sacrifices, and a protracted war to control the enemy's lifeline and win the final victory. We can only resolutely, under the leadership of the wise and sacred President, embrace the determination to break the boat and carry out the task of resisting the war to the end, without wavering our will due to any difficulties and hardships, in order to drive out the Japanese army and save the nation. Second, do our best to destroy the Japanese puppet organizations. The enemy's consistent conspiracy is to use puppet organizations as a tool of aggression, the purpose of which is to deceive our people and make them slaves without realizing it. Every one of our people must not forget the blood debts, strictly abide by the National Covenant, stand in the position of the country and the nation, inspire loyalty and righteousness, and defend the territory and sovereignty, and give the enemy puppets a head-on blow everywhere, in order to smash the enemy's conspiracy and eliminate the puppet organizations. Third, all wartime work must be carried out regularly and without interruption. At this critical moment of the War of Resistance, all wartime organizations should be doubly strict, and all wartime work should be doubly intense. All comrades and compatriots should be more loyal and strengthen their spiritual mobilization. All rear production, and the recent launch of the winter clothing fundraising campaign, must be carried out with all efforts to achieve the task of the national war of resistance. In short, our responsibility is not only to defend Hunan and Jiangxi, but also to defend China, not only to drive the Japanese army out of Hunan and Jiangxi, but also to drive the Japanese army out of Chinese territory. I command my armed comrades to vow to live and die with the land we defend, and even if there is one soldier left, we will fight to the end. I hope that my loyal and patriotic comrades and compatriots will not be arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat, be firm and calm, indomitable, and make persistent efforts to turn Hunan and Jiangxi into the graveyard of the Japanese army, and strive for the final victory of the War of Resistance to ensure the eternal survival and independence of the Chinese nation.

### New Understanding of the Battle Situation in Northern Hunan

The battle in northern Hunan has come to an end recently, and it can be said that China has achieved a great victory surpassing the Battle of Taierzhuang. After a long period of silence in the frontline war, just as the Double Ten Festival of the 28th year is approaching, this good news of victory is like adding glorious celebration materials to China's National Day. Imagine how every Chinese soldier and civilian should rejoice and be encouraged!

The so-called new offensive of the Japanese army has been rumored for a long time. Even before the outbreak of the European War, there were messages about the main attack, the auxiliary attack, the guerrilla attack, and the feint attack flying between China and Japan. Although the Japanese army would never announce in advance where they would attack, it was probably a strategic necessity for them to launch a large-scale offensive in September and October. What's more, since the European War had already broken out in early September, and the complicated relations between international countries were not yet very clear, it was indeed the most appropriate opportunity for the Japanese army to take a new offensive. Generally speaking, the direction of the Japanese army's offensive at the current stage is no more than two: one is to spy on the northwest, and the other is to open up the Yuehan Railway. However, due to the relationship between the front line and the military strength, it is impossible to advance on both roads at the same time, and the outer line of Wuhan is not consolidated. It is impossible to easily risk trying either of these two roads. The so-called Shanxi "mopping-up" battle more than two months ago was obviously a preparation for attacking the northwest; but this preparation work failed, and there is no certainty of attacking the northwest at present. In this battle in northern Hunan, the Japanese army's goal was to capture Changsha, which was obviously carrying out the second attempt, hoping to achieve the initial goal of opening up the Yuehan Railway; moreover, Changsha is fundamentally one of the important strongholds on the periphery of Wuhan. Therefore, even if the Yuehan Railway cannot be opened up in the future, capturing Changsha is still a necessary measure to defend Wuhan. Therefore, this time the Japanese army used elite army divisions such as Saito Iye, Amakasu, Fujita, and Ogisu, combined with naval landing troops, totaling hundreds of thousands, and launched the most fierce offensive from western Jiangxi and northern Hunan at the same time, attempting to occupy Changsha in a short period of time. This shows the importance they attached to this decisive battle. Unexpectedly, the north and south of the Miluo River have always been places where the loyal spirit of Qu Lingjun, the great Chinese national poet, has been widely deepened. This time, it has gathered and annihilated two or three thousand Japanese soldiers, creating a glorious battle record in the history of the nation. Although it cannot be said that China's war of resistance has laid the foundation for victory, the Japanese offensive has been frustrated, and the military strategy that has been prepared for a long time has been shattered, which is certain and undeniable. The national spirit of China should not be underestimated, and the strength of China's war of resistance is growing. In this battle in northern Hunan, the Japanese army should also be taught a lesson from the facts.

Leaving aside the military point of view, it is rumored that the Japanese army's attack on Changsha this time has another political function; although we do not need to speculate on what content the Japanese political function has, any political function has also failed in this decisive battle, or at least cannot be carried out smoothly, which is also undoubtedly obvious.

As for the Chinese side, although the battle in northern Hunan is just one of countless large and small battles in the process of the War of Resistance, and it is also one of many victorious battles; but judging from the nature of this decisive battle, there are also several characteristics that can be recognized: First, Changsha is located on the Dongting Plain. Moreover, it is close to Dongting Lake, and it is very easy to be attacked by the opponent's naval, land, and air forces at the same time. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall situation of the War of Resistance, this place has the possibility of being abandoned; however, this time the Chinese army actually broke the geographical restrictions with heroic bloody battles, not only did it not face the crisis of the enemy approaching the city, but also won a great victory, driving the Japanese army back to the old trenches of the Xinqiang River more than ten months ago, which cannot be denied is a great turning point in the military of the War of Resistance; Moreover, it can also prove that the final victory that has always been called for is not just empty words, but in fact there is a possibility of being realized in advance. Second, since the outbreak of the European War a month ago, the international assistance that China has received is inevitably affected to some extent; however, the Chinese government has repeatedly stated that the War of Resistance is mainly based on self-reliance and will not focus on international assistance. Now it has won a very large victory under such an international environment, which not only confirms that the authorities' statement is not just a consolation, but also enough to encourage the people of the whole country to increase their courage and strengthen their self-confidence, which is of great significance in the continued process of the War of Resistance in the future. Third, since China abandoned Wuhan and Guangzhou, the anti-Japanese army has been thoroughly reorganized, and in the southwest, it has stored very rich new military strength. Whether in terms of personnel or weapons, this battle in northern Hunan can be said to be a "small test of skills" for the new military strength in the southwest. Perhaps the Japanese army also has the meaning of testing the new military strength, but China has indeed won a lot of victories, which shows that the sentence that China's anti-Japanese strength has increased is not a dishonored check, and of course it also has infinite significance in the grasp of the final victory. Fourth, the Japanese army often uses the so-called cone-shaped tactics when attacking an important location, breaking through on the front. In order to avoid sacrifices, the Chinese army often avoids the real and takes the false, and changes to the method of encirclement to attack its sides and backs, but as a result, due to the disparity in military strength, the Japanese army's cone-shaped tactics still work. This time, the Japanese army attacked Changsha and still followed the old trick. The main force advanced fiercely southward along the Yuehan Railway, but the Chinese army's flanking surprise attack tactics unexpectedly worked miraculously, which shows that the situation has changed. From a military and technical point of view, it has gradually turned to the stage favorable to the Chinese army.

In short, the Japanese army regards occupying a large city as an imaginary victory in the war against China. At present, even this kind of illusion is not easy to obtain, which should be a time for them to deeply and keenly reflect!

### The Soviet Union Asks Lithuania for the Right to Station Troops at Sea and Air, and Senior Officials of Latvia are to Revisit Moscow to Negotiate the Conclusion of a New Trade Agreement

The country's newspapers have recently published hostile editorials on German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow, and its foreign policy also has an anti-German tendency. However, for the sake of laying a solid foundation for peace in Southeastern Europe, the Black Sea region, and the Mediterranean coast, the country's current policy urgently needs to be clarified."

### Under the Threat of Aggression, Britain and France Will Not Lightly Speak of Peace; Hitler's Suggestions Are Vague and Do Not Help the Overall Situation; British Government Sternly Refutes Slanderous Remarks About Poland; Chamberlain Will Formally Clarify His Attitude

Paris: The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee met this afternoon, and Prime Minister Daladier attended and delivered a speech with impassioned words, stating, "The goal of Britain and France in going to war is to stop aggression. Regarding France's current foreign policy, I have explained it to the National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee on the 4th of this month. In short, what Britain and France seek is peace based on respect for the rule of law. Therefore, anyone who seeks hegemony in Europe is not allowed. This kind of peace can only be achieved under the condition of respecting the freedom and rights of all nations. Britain and France will not stop fighting until this goal is achieved." (Havas, 6th)

London: Well-informed sources here recently announced that Prime Minister Chamberlain is expected to make a statement to the House of Commons early next week regarding the "suggestions" made by German leader Hitler yesterday. However, the date has not yet been determined. It is likely that he will first deliver a brief speech on Monday (the 9th of this month), and then elaborate on it on Wednesday (the 11th of this month), thereby clearly explaining Britain's attitude. From now until then, the British government will exchange views with the French government and the governments of the various dominions. As for the content of Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, it can be glimpsed from the semi-official commentary here. In other words, Hitler's speech yesterday did not contain a basis for negotiation. It is evident that Prime Minister Chamberlain will firmly reject the suggestions made by the German side in the name of the British government, the governments of the various dominions, and the French government. (Havas, 7th)

London: The British government has recently issued a statement refuting the various points made in Hitler's speech, stating that the full text of Hitler's speech in parliament only arrived in London this afternoon, so it has not been studied in detail. The speech is divided into two parts. The first part recounts past events, many of which are contrary to the truth. This point is well known to the people of this country and the world. For example, Hitler's claim that the German side used humane methods in the Polish war has been proven inaccurate by the discussions in the British Parliament and the reports of the British ambassador in Warsaw. Hitler's claim that the Czech people voluntarily requested to be incorporated into German territory does not need to be refuted. Hitler's claim that an Englishman in 1598 spoke of the Poles as cruel and lacking moral concepts, proving that Poland lacks any historical, cultural, or moral basis as a nation, is completely contrary to Hitler's words in parliament on May 21, 1935: "We recognize Poland as a great and patriotic nation-state." Hitler also said that for many years, other countries have imposed on German foreign policy purposes that could only exist in children's imaginations. If other countries have misunderstood Germany, it must have originated from Hitler's openly ambition to dominate the world as stated in "Mein Kampf," as well as Hitler's words and deeds since taking office. Hitler has repeatedly said that the current war was caused by Britain. In fact, Germany has created a dangerous situation in the past two years, while the British government has always worked hard to preserve peace. This fact is universally recognized. The second part of Hitler's speech contains several of what Hitler calls peace proposals. In their current form, these proposals are mostly vague and do not contain any suggestions as to how Germany will compensate for the damage it has inflicted on other countries. However, the British government, as the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have previously announced, will carefully study this proposal together with the Dominion governments and the French government. But two things must be remembered: (1) A peace proposal cannot be considered acceptable unless it effectively removes Europe from the danger of aggression. (2) The guarantees previously given by the German government have proven to be worthless. Therefore, the trust on which the necessary foundations for peace are based today is not just empty words.

### Hitler's Speech Is Not the Final Suggestion; The Door to Diplomatic Negotiations Is Said to Be Open; If Rejected, He Will Not Shrink from a Fight

Berlin: Senior Nazi officials claimed last night that if Britain and France feel that Hitler's peace suggestions to the German parliament should be expanded, then Chancellor Hitler would be very willing to do so. After Chancellor Hitler addressed the German parliament, senior Nazi officials hurriedly clarified to foreign journalists that the peace terms outlined by Hitler were not the final suggestions of the German side. The German peace offensive has not stopped. A powerful source in Germany claimed that Chancellor Hitler's "moderate tone" and his disarmament suggestions will elicit a beneficial response from the United States. Chancellor Hitler and other Nazi leaders expressed disappointment at the initial reaction of Britain and France. Nazi officials solemnly declared that regardless of the attitude of Britain and France, Chancellor Hitler does not intend to wait for a complete answer. A German leader claimed, "The European situation is about to be revealed." He said that if Hitler's peace suggestions are rejected, then the German army, navy, and air force will launch a large-scale attack on the Allied forces in the west. (Associated Press, 7th)

Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry, in answering the question of what diplomatic steps Germany will take to promote peace, declared today, "A straightforward question also requires a straightforward answer." He pointed out that Hitler has stated that Germany cannot take any further action in the current situation, and that the door to negotiations through normal diplomatic channels is now open without obstruction. (Haitong, 7th)

Berlin: Political circles here attach great importance to Hitler's speech in parliament, believing that Hitler is preparing to engage in diplomatic discussions in order to build peace in Europe. According to general observation, although the procedures for conducting diplomatic discussions have not been announced, the path to reaching an understanding still exists. Since Germany has made suggestions, all parties can make motions and exchange opinions. Regarding the issue of ethnic minorities, the official has not yet issued a document. Currently, there are 650,000 Germans in Hungary, 700,000 Germans in Yugoslavia, 800,000 in Romania, 60,000 Germans in both Lithuania and Latvia, fewer in Estonia, and about 120,000 Germans in eastern Galicia and Ukraine. The Soviet Union and Germany seem to have a plan for cooperation in solving the problem of ethnic minorities. As for the colonial issue, authoritative sources solemnly stated that this is a legitimate and immovable requirement of German foreign policy and has nothing to do with the current disputes or war. Although the colonial issue can be slightly delayed, it must not be ignored. (Haitong, 7th)

### A Glimpse of British and French Newspaper Commentary

London: The "Daily Herald" today criticized Hitler's speech yesterday, saying that if Hitler wants peace, he can express it through action, not just empty words, because his words are of little credibility. Hitler can withdraw his troops in Poland and agree to place the restoration of Poland and Czechoslovakia on the agenda of the proposed great power conference. On this basis, there is a possibility of a real conference. If the conference is only to confirm the gains of his aggression, then there is no peace to speak of. Our principles for joining the war are firm and unshakable by empty promises or threats. (Reuters, 7th)

Paris: The newspapers here are very indifferent to the speech delivered yesterday by German leader Hitler, or they express it in a sarcastic tone, and they all believe that Hitler is at a loss and does not know what to do. The "Radical Socialist Party Business News" said that the German leader Hitler has fallen into a dilemma, so he is equivocating. If he puts forward concrete suggestions, he will be rejected by Britain and France, but because the German people have already been bound, he has to mention peace suggestions. Also, because Germany has no allies to rely on, it does not dare to openly threaten democratic countries. As for the establishment of a military alliance treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union, it is absolutely impossible. Stalin has probably explained this to him, and Hitler did not mention it at all." The moderate "Order News" said, "The German leader Hitler advocated convening an international conference, saying that it must be thoroughly prepared in advance. In fact, the method of preparation has been explained in detail by Chamberlain, Daladier, and Halifax. What is the method? It is to eliminate National Socialism. Now, if you want to give an answer to the German leader Hitler, you only need to reiterate the previous proposal." The radical "Socialist Party New Era News" said, "Hitler once said that he does not care about international public opinion, but only cares about German domestic public opinion. This can be said to be shameless, but in fact, the so-called domestic public opinion is just the opinion expressed by him personally." The right-wing "Little Parisian News" said, "The German leader Hitler implicitly advocates a ceasefire first, and then talks. Other than that, there is no concrete suggestion... The German people know that the current war will lead to poverty and a terrible crisis, so the German leader Hitler is eager to end the war to comfort them." The right-wing "Era News" said, "We have heard what the German leader Hitler said five or six times, and we are already very familiar with it... This speech is extremely ordinary and is probably aimed at domestic audiences." The "Paris Echo" said, "The first part of this speech is extremely hateful. If the speaker had any sense of shame, this part alone would be enough to ruin his reputation." (Havas, 7th)

### Different Reactions to Hitler's Speech in Various Countries; American Newspapers Said That Vicious Arguments Do Not Help Peace; Suspicion of Germany Remains Among Neutral Countries; Soviet Union Is Satisfied, Rome's Sympathy Is Expected

Washington

The "Washington Star" criticized Hitler's speech, saying that peace is no closer as a result of this kind of malicious argument. "The New York Post" said that Hitler's new arguments, with grand words and both promises and threats, are unlikely to be the basis for order in Europe. All sectors here believe that the United States cannot endorse the kind of peace proposed by Hitler, because the United States not only refuses to recognize the fate of Czechoslovakia, but also refuses to recognize the partition of Poland. A peace settlement that makes these two countries vassals of Germany will not be welcomed by the United States. Hitler's remarks about the Soviet Union are entirely wishful thinking, and it seems that German-Soviet relations are actually more friendly, and his remarks about Italy are even more vague, with no mention of Mussolini's military obligations to Hitler. Hitler's demand for the restoration of colonies will be a major step for Britain, but what will Hitler give in return? Other than his guarantee of peaceful intentions, there is no compensation, and this guarantee has already been broken by Germany more than once. A detailed analysis of Hitler's speech does not reveal that Hitler is making any concessions in exchange for his demands. What he seeks is extravagant, and what he is willing to give is nothing. It is known that peace, Germany will greatly benefit from it. However, even if Hitler obtains this great benefit, it seems that he will still not be able to get along with other countries. American senators are not interested in Hitler's speech and believe that it will not have much impact on the progress of the US Neutrality Act debate. President Roosevelt told reporters at his Hyde Park in New York today that he has not yet had the opportunity to read Hitler's speech. (Reuters, 7th)

Rome

Italian people are very supportive of Hitler's speech. Hitler's suggestion to convene an international conference to eliminate political, commercial and military problems related to the interests of the world is praised by people here. Political and diplomatic circles in Rome are waiting for the reaction of Britain and France to the various suggestions for resolving the dispute. Italian newspapers believe that Hitler's speech is another step towards peace. For the sake of saving Europe, Hitler's suggestion is the only way out. (Haitong, 7th)

Rome: Italian authoritative sources believe that Hitler's speech is strongly worded, substantive, and constructive. (Reuters, 7th)

Moscow

Although the official did not criticize Hitler's speech, there is reason to believe that people here are satisfied with this speech, especially with the firm guarantee of peace in Eastern Europe and the fact that the Soviet Union and Germany independently decided the fate of Poland. The German leader did not mention possible Soviet assistance in the European war, which can be regarded as another sign that the Soviet Union will remain neutral if possible. (Reuters, 7th)

Moscow: The speech given by German leader Hitler yesterday was also broadcast here. Political figures in Moscow initially commented that Hitler's peace suggestions were accurate and clear, and also based on the spirit of the Soviet-German agreement. All circles paid special attention to the cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany in transforming the order of Eastern Europe. Moscow newspapers have not yet published comments today, but they will be available tomorrow. (Haitong, 7th)

Neutral Countries

Paris: The various neutral countries responded to the speech given yesterday by German leader Hitler with extreme suspicion. This can be seen in the newspapers. The main points are as follows:

(1) The Dutch newspaper "Maasbode" stated that "Leader Hitler already feels that the bet he has made is very large and shows embarrassment. As for the attack on Poland, it is surprising that a great nation like Germany would impose this kind of argument on a defeated enemy."

(2) Swiss newspapers generally said that "this speech is not credible." The "Bern Defender" stated that "this is not a peace suggestion, but only a self-defense by the country to the people of the world. Leader Hitler has already tied himself up."

(3) The Romanian capital's "Universal News" stated that "Hitler is eager to end the war as soon as possible, and his feelings are overflowing." Other newspapers said that the content of the speech did not contain concrete peace suggestions.

(4) Newspapers in the Yugoslavian capital generally said that it is difficult for the two Allied countries, Britain and France, to trust Hitler, and Hitler's remarks are also difficult for those countries to believe.

(5) Newspapers in the Bulgarian capital stated that Hitler did not make concrete peace suggestions.

(6) Turkish newspapers commented extensively. The semi-official "Ulus" newspaper stated that Hitler's suggestions "should not be accepted. Germany has not given an inch and is still greedy. Now, the guarantees it provides to France are almost the same as those it provided to Czechoslovakia and Poland." (Havas, 7th)

Tokyo

Japanese newspapers criticized Hitler's speech, believing that Britain and France may not seriously consider the German leader's peace suggestions. "Dokuritsu News" said that it is doubtful whether Britain and France will accept the international conference. It is expected that Britain and France will continue to fight until Poland is restored to its satisfaction. "Daily News" said that Chamberlain has repeatedly expressed distrust of Hitler and does not need to accept the suggestion now. (Reuters, 7th)

Tokyo: Today's "Japan Times" criticized Hitler's speech, saying that Germany has now completed its occupation of Poland. If peace can be established on the basis of this accomplished fact, it will be a great victory for Germany. In his speech, Hitler announced that if Britain and France reject Germany's peace construction, they will bear the responsibility for prolonging the European war. This declaration may stimulate the German people to fight Britain and France with redoubled efforts, but what we worry about is that this declaration may not be able to shake the established goals of the Allied countries. Now that things have come to this point, even great politicians cannot end the European war in a short period of time. Some events beyond human power will drive the European war to a painful conclusion. (Reuters)

### Roosevelt Ignores Hastening to Mediate the European Situation; Must First Obtain the Consent and Guarantee of Britain and France

Washington: According to Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, President Roosevelt is willing to do his part for peace in Europe when the time is ripe. However, the president can only take action when the warring parties have a clear expression of willingness to coordinate. Before this intention of the warring countries is expressed, any expression by the president will be regarded by the warring countries as an intrusive intervention. Only when the conditions are met will President Roosevelt be willing to act as a mediator. (Associated Press, 7th)

Washington: Government officials here are unwilling to criticize reports from Berlin that the United States and other neutral countries will support Hitler's peaceful posture. Observers here believe that this news is not reliable. Unless Britain and France are willing to use Hitler's suggestions as the basis for negotiations, the United States will not act arbitrarily, and what the United States can do is only friendly mediation. (Associated Press, 7th)

Berlin: According to General Goering's organ, "Essen National News," the United States may be able to support Hitler's peace suggestions, and the Soviet Union may also be able to make efforts for European peace. In order to promote peace, Germany is very willing to accept a ceasefire in order to convene an international conference to engage in peace negotiations. Germany is willing to accept the current situation in Europe. Germany's future demands are only on the return of the colonies. It also said that Mussolini, Franco, and the Pope will soon launch a peace movement. As for President Roosevelt, because he is the leader of a neutral country, he is most suitable as a mediator. (Associated Press, 7th)

### Hitler's Speech Has No Impact on the US; No Change in General Sentiment in the US Senate

Washington - Hitler's speech in the German Reichstag yesterday had no impact on the US congressional debate on amending the Neutrality Act. Nebraska Republican Senator Norris said, "I have no trust in Hitler. He has lied too many times. Every time he gains something, he claims he has no further territorial ambitions." Prominent isolationist Bora said, "We don't believe either side's words." The youngest isolationist Senator Holt said, "This is just another European problem. No matter how they solve it, it will only lay a foundation for the next great war." Utah Democratic Senator King said he firmly believes that the Soviet Union and Germany will cooperate to destroy all democratic countries. (Associated Press, 7th)

Washington - According to Dow Jones News Service, the informal poll of senators' sentiments shows that senators have not changed their opinions since the Senate began debating the government's Neutrality Act amendments, including repealing the arms embargo, on Monday. If the Senate were to vote today, the count would be 55 in favor of repeal, 31 against, and 10 abstaining or absent. (Reuters, 7th)

Washington - Yesterday, the Pittman Bill was introduced in the US Senate for discussion. Isolationists spoke out in opposition. For example, Senator Danahey stated that if the Pittman Bill were passed, various dangers could arise and said that this bill runs counter to US neutrality. (Haitong Electric, 7th)

### Japanese Government Recalls Ambassador to Germany

Tokyo - The Japanese government announced yesterday the recall of Lieutenant General Hiroshi Oshima, the Japanese ambassador to Germany. This move is another blow by the Japanese government to those who advocate Japan joining the Rome-Berlin Axis. Well-informed sources claim that Lieutenant General Hiroshi Oshima was the strongest advocate for concluding a military alliance with Germany and Italy. His replacement will be Saburo Kurusu, the Japanese ambassador to Belgium. It is widely believed that Kurusu belongs to the faction of the Japanese diplomatic corps that is inclined towards democratic countries. His appointment can be seen as a sharp rebuke to the young officers in Japan who advocate concluding a military alliance with the European Axis powers. (Associated Press, 7th)

### Japan Purchases Large Quantities of Kerosene from the US

Green Cedar City, USA - California's four major kerosene companies, namely General Kerosene Company, United Kerosene Company, Richfield Kerosene Company, and Mobil Kerosene Company, have recently signed a contract with the Japanese government to supply the country's navy with more than 3 million barrels of kerosene. This kerosene will be shipped from here in batches over the next three months. (Havas, 7th)

### US Sends Warship to Protect Merchant Ships; USS Iroquois Warned by Germany

Washington - The Navy Committee announced yesterday that the crew of the USS Iroquois had received instructions from the White House to navigate with extra caution. Presidential Secretary Early confirmed yesterday that German Admiral Raeder had his naval attaché sign the warning he sent to the US. Another report said that Admiral Raeder obtained this information from Ireland, but this could not be confirmed. Admiral Raeder warned the US government that the USS Iroquois, carrying American citizens back to the US, would suffer the same fate as the Athena, being bombed by the British or French. President Roosevelt said in a speech at Hyde Park that providing military escort to the Iroquois would not be set as a precedent, and that the same protection would be provided for every American vessel. (Associated Press, 7th)

London - An official statement issued here today stated that the British Admiralty has taken note of Berlin's statement that the American ship Iroquois will also be sunk in circumstances similar to those encountered by the Athena. It was found that those rescued from the Athena, which was sunk by a German submarine, clearly witnessed the German submarine. There were no British submarines within hundreds of miles at the time. Therefore, the German government's current statement makes Britain understand and measure the criminal psychology of the National Socialist leaders even more clearly. However, it is surprising that naval officers of the German Imperial era, such as the current head of the German Navy, Admiral Raeder, are willing to associate with them and demean their reputation. (Reuters, 6th)

Hyde Park, New York - President Roosevelt told reporters here today that the US dispatching naval vessels to protect the American ship Iroquois (according to the commander-in-chief of the German Navy, the ship will be bombed when approaching the United States) is a good example of the US Navy patrol operating in the Atlantic. When asked if this was a precedent for warships escorting other American ships, President Roosevelt replied "Yes" and said that neutral patrol ships are already at sea, so protecting the Iroquois is even easier. According to reports, the Iroquois is carrying 584 American passengers from Europe. (Reuters, 6th)

### Mexican Mechanics Repair Submarine, Violating Neutral Rights

Mexico City - It is rumored that two skilled mechanics from the postal ship Columbus have been away from the ship for two days repairing the diesel engine of a submarine near the coast. Although the Mexican authorities have removed the ship's radio equipment, it is believed that the ship may still have a small one. If the above incident is confirmed, the ship will be in violation of neutral rights and will be forced to leave overseas within 24 hours. (Reuters, 7th)

### Japanese Aircraft Preparing for Round-the-World Flight

Tokyo - According to news here today, the Japanese monoplane "Nippon" is currently making a round-the-world goodwill flight.

It was originally scheduled to fly via Madrid to Paris, London, and Rome. It is now planned to take off from Dakar and fly via Agadir, Casablanca, and Seville in Morocco to Rome.

Green Cedar City, USA - A total of 250 of the latest fighter planes ordered by Britain and France from the United States will be manufactured and stored in warehouses before the end of this year. After the arms embargo clause in the current Neutrality Act is repealed, they will be shipped to these countries one after another. These aircraft are worth a total of $33 million. Manufacturers have received advance notices from agents, asking them to continue manufacturing as usual and wait for the special session of Congress to amend the current Neutrality Act. (Havas, 7th)

### US Far East Trade Volume Sharply Increased Compared to Before

New York - Within two weeks of the outbreak of the European war, the number of long-distance telephone calls between the United States and the Far East has increased by 50% compared to before. This can be regarded as a sign of extraordinary prosperity in trade. As for long-distance telephone calls and telegrams between Europe and the United States, although they are strictly checked by the authorities in certain European countries, their turnover has more than doubled compared to before the war. The turnover of domestic telegrams in the United States has also increased by 25% to 30%. In addition, the turnover of long-distance telephone calls between the United States and South American countries has more than doubled compared to before. All of these are good phenomena from a commercial standpoint. (Havas, 7th)

### Internal Strife in Japanese Foreign Ministry; Nomura Compromise Plan Adopted, Accepts Subordinate's Suggestions

Tokyo - The Japanese government has decided to appoint Foreign Minister Nomura with full authority to handle the turmoil in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Foreign Minister hopes to find a way to resolve it peacefully. The opinions of various newspapers and the public have gradually become more critical of the lack of discipline of the resigning personnel. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the attitude of the young officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is regrettable and praised Prime Minister Abe and Foreign Minister Nomura for insisting that the cabinet's plan should not be changed. The Miyako Shimbun stated that this dispute is actually a struggle for power and said that the whole country will support the Foreign Minister's decisive handling of this turmoil. Some observers here believe that Foreign Minister Nomura will not resign because of this incident, but the positions of Gaima Masano, and other senior officials will inevitably be shaken. (Reuters, 7th)

Tokyo - More than 300 lower-ranking officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted their resignations in opposition to the Foreign Minister's decision to establish a Ministry of Trade. At the same time, they also sent 18 representatives to meet with Foreign Minister Nomura. It is heard that Nomura, in order to calm the situation, has submitted a compromise plan to the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and encouraged them to abide by the discipline of civil servants. It is said that although this compromise plan has accommodated the opinions of the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the establishment of the Ministry of Trade will still not be changed. According to officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, matters relating to diplomatic negotiations should be under the control of the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but now the cabinet has decided that they should be under the control of the Ministry of Trade. Therefore, the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believe that it violates precedent. However, it is heard that the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may be able to accept this compromise plan. (Associated Press, 7th)

### France Will Organize Light Infantry Units

Beijing - Today's Peking Morning Post reported that France will organize light infantry units, and some prisoners will also be incorporated into this unit to go to the front line to atone for their crimes.

For goods transported to Mediterranean ports (except Alexandria and Port Said), the previous charge was 8 yuan, but now it has been reduced to 4 yuan. The war risk insurance premium for goods transported by Japanese-American merchant ships will be reduced by half. (Reuters, 7th)

### German Troops on the Western Front Begin Fierce Counteroffensive; Attempt to Recapture the Warndt Forest Area; British Expeditionary Force Continues to Arrive in France

Paris - Yesterday, in order to respond to Prime Minister Hitler's address to the German Reichstag, the German army on the Western Front launched a fierce counteroffensive against the French army, attempting to drive out the French army within the range of the German artillery in the "Siegfried" line southwest of Saarbrucken. The German army launched an attack on the French outposts, concentrating their efforts on the French positions on the south bank of the Saar River between Saarlouis and Saarbrucken. Germany attempted to destroy the French artillery on the small hill of Paulus in Saarlouis, but the French army resisted fiercely. The German army also attempted to reoccupy the Warndt Forest area before the French army consolidated the Bati there. French authorities stated yesterday that after German troops arrived by train from Bohemia, Moravia, and Poland in the Black Forest, they rushed to the "Siegfried" front opposite the Saar area. They had anticipated that the German army would launch a large-scale counteroffensive in an attempt to recover the lost territory. (Associated Press, 7th)

London - British Expeditionary Force troops are currently traveling day and night to France to fight alongside the Allied French forces on the front lines. These troops have not encountered any obstacles or casualties while crossing the English Channel. This is all due to the proper dispatch of the transportation department. Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned this when he reported to the House of Commons yesterday on the first month of combat after the start of the war. In addition, the authorities have heard that domestic reporters will be allowed to accompany the expeditionary force to the front lines in the short term to report on the war. (Havas, 6th)

Paris - General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 65, stating, "Our outpost units had contact in many places on the front line today. Enemy units attacked our positions northwest of Wissembourg and were repulsed." (Havas, 6th)

Paris - General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 66, stating, "Both sides' scouting units were at certain places on the front line, it is permitted to reconnoiter southwest of Saarbrucken." (Havas, 7th)

Paris - The view held by military observers here that the future offensive of the German army on the Western Front will be launched on the front of the Maginot Line seems to be gaining strength. As winter is approaching rapidly, Hitler will not attempt to break through the muddy plains of Flanders or invade Switzerland and create new enemies for himself. Although the French army occupies a large area of German territory, and no German soldiers are in French territory, this point has a negative impact on the vanity of Germany. Hitler, motivated by prestige, may attack the area between the Rhine and the Moselle. The French army has fortified the recently captured points in this area. The German army must first break through this terrible obstacle before it can reach the main fortifications of the Maginot Line. According to the Reuters military reporter, after France repeatedly launched surprise attacks, it has now estimated the forest of Bogue. The strategic importance of this forest cannot be overestimated. The French army has also advanced to the wooded highlands around Wasch and Zierges, all of which are highlands that can serve as the main positions overlooking the Saar River. The rumor that Germany has giant new tanks may be an exaggeration. All countries have tested cruiser-type tanks, and British cruiser-type tanks may be better than those of other countries. However, these heavy weapons must be equipped with towing seats, so their practicality is reduced accordingly. The recent French battle report stated, "Light infantry is quite active in many parts of the front, and the enemy's attack on a French sentry position in the area west of Wissembourg has been repulsed. British Commander-in-Chief Sir Ironside and Air Chief Marshal Newell met with French General Gamelin, General Vuillemin, and General Georges today to discuss current combat methods. This decisive meeting reiterated the complete consensus of opinions between the two commanders. (Reuters, 7th)

Berlin - The German High Command issued an official bulletin today stating that the enemy's forward activities on the Western Front have been repelled. French reconnaissance planes attempted to cross the Rhine River in the afternoon and were driven back by German fighter planes. One was shot down in Godesberg, and another was forced to land in the town of Usk. The four people in the plane, including a lieutenant colonel staff officer, were captured. The German Air Force suffered no losses. (Haitong Electric, 7th)

### British and French Air Forces Cooperate Smoothly

Paris - Air Chief Marshal Newall of the British Air Force made a statement to the press here this morning, stating that since the beginning of the war, British Air Force units have been stationed at various bases in France for several weeks. British bombers and fighters have also arrived one after another, almost every day. Some of them operate independently, while others cooperate with the French Air Force. This is the same smooth cooperation as between the two countries' navies and armies. The British troops have been warmly received by the French residents wherever they have gone, which is deeply appreciated. The British planes that have arrived in France are actually the advance units of the British Expeditionary Force. The activities of the British planes will be considered and allowed for the press to visit. In addition, the staff offices of the British and French armies and air forces recently held a meeting to discuss the details of combat operations, so that the efficiency of cooperation between the two sides can reach its peak. From now on, meetings will be held frequently. (Havas, 7th)

### Fierce Battle at Chen Village, Lingshou, Hebei

Luoyang - The long-dormant war situation in central Hebei saw a major victory for the Chinese army near Lingshou at the end of last month. A bloody battle lasting three days and nights resulted in the annihilation of over 2,000 Japanese soldiers, a feat rarely seen in recent campaigns in central Hebei. The Japanese troops of the Kuwata unit, numbering over 1,700, stationed in Chen Village northwest of Lingshou, were encircled and fiercely attacked by a certain Chinese unit in a mobile maneuver on the morning of September 27th. After a day and night of intense fighting, the Japanese troops, unable to withstand the onslaught, retreated towards Gaojia Village and the area east and southeast of Sijia Village (both located southeast of Chen Village). The Chinese army pursued them relentlessly, preventing any escape, and surrounded the Japanese troops again at Gaojia Village. After another day and night of fighting, on the morning of the 29th, over 400 Japanese soldiers from Ciyu and over 200 from Xingtang attempted to reinforce the besieged troops via different routes, but were ambushed by the Chinese forces in advance and annihilated midway. The Japanese then dispatched several aircraft to cover their breakout, but the Chinese army lured them to the Nanshan area and, after a bloody half-day battle, completely annihilated them. In this battle, in addition to capturing over 500 rifles and pistols, 23 light and heavy machine guns, and a large quantity of other military supplies, over 50-60 Japanese and puppet soldiers were captured alive. The Japanese troops in Shijiazhuang, Lingshou, Jingxing, and other places are reportedly in extreme panic upon hearing of this successive defeat. (7th dispatch)

### Japanese Troops in Shandong Province Transferred to Central China to Participate in the Invasion of Hunan; Over 2,000 Have Withdrawn Successively; Passenger Ticket Sales Suspended on the Jiaoji Railway

Qingdao Correspondence - After the outbreak of the battle in northern Hunan, the Japanese troops originally stationed in Shandong Province to carry out the so-called "mopping-up of guerrilla areas" were ordered to concentrate in Central China, intending to participate in the invasion of Changsha. In recent days, over 2,000 Japanese troops have withdrawn successively from Shijiu. Many Japanese warships have arrived in Qingdao, carrying Japanese troops out of the port daily, in varying numbers. Passenger ticket sales on the Jiaoji Railway have been suspended. There is also talk that the Qingdao Customs may cease operations. The Chinese army in southeastern Shandong is becoming increasingly active. The Japanese troops within the territory of Pingdu in Shandong have been annihilated, making it, along with the three counties of Laiyang, Haiyang, and Qixia, a complete area of eastern Shandong. One day, a train carrying Japanese soldiers heading east on the Jiaoji Railway was blown up by Chinese guerrillas while passing through Zhoucun, killing and wounding 70-80 Japanese soldiers.

### Chinese Army in Guangdong Province Attacks Shenzhen; Shenzhen Has Long Been Surrounded; Fighting is Quite Intense

Hong Kong Correspondence - The Chinese army in Guangdong Province has long been preparing to attack the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line, launching an offensive against Shenzhen and Nantou in its southern section starting on the night of September 30th. From 10 p.m. that night, intense artillery fire, dense gunfire, and hand grenade explosions were heard from the border area. According to a cook who escaped from the Japanese side in Shenzhen after being captured, multiple Chinese plainclothes soldiers suddenly appeared in Shenzhen around 10 p.m. that night. One group launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops, all carrying hand grenades and pistols, putting the Japanese in a very embarrassing situation, causing them to flee in disarray. Another group immediately set fires everywhere as a signal, and the Chinese counter-attacking forces began to move, bombarding Shenzhen with artillery and attacking the Japanese troops there simultaneously. It is also said that the total number of Japanese troops in Shenzhen is around 1,500.

During the Chinese army's attack on Shenzhen, another unit attacked Nantou, simultaneously cutting off the communication lines between the Japanese troops in Nantou and Shenzhen. All bridges on the highway from Shenzhen to Nantou were destroyed to prevent Japanese troops in Nantou from reinforcing Shenzhen. During this period, the Chinese army surrounded Shenzhen and launched a fierce attack on the area, forcing a small number of Japanese troops in Shatoujiao to withdraw. It is said that there were no Japanese troops in Shatoujiao on the 1st of this month, but the exact situation inland is still unknown. According to someone who observed the battle situation on a hilltop on the New Territories border on the morning of the 1st, around 2 p.m. in the afternoon, five Japanese aircraft were seen circling outside Shenzhen and dropping bombs. Each bomb explosion caused smoke and earth to rise from the ground, reaching several dozen feet high, with extremely loud explosions. The explosions of the shells fired by the Chinese army at the Japanese troops were also clearly visible. The artillery battle between the two sides was extremely fierce, with one shell fired every minute. On that day, Japanese aircraft dropped as many as a hundred bombs. Based on the locations where the Japanese aircraft dropped their bombs, it appears that the Chinese attacking forces have approached the vicinity of Shenzhen, and the fighting is becoming increasingly intense.

The British border is currently guarded by Indian troops. When Japanese aircraft approach the British border, the British army is on high alert. The Indian troops prohibit nearby residents from approaching the border and drive away those watching from the hilltops.

### Anti-British Movement Another Step by the Japanese Army in North China; Churches and Hospitals Are Devastated; British Staff Members Are Also Detained

According to a Reuters dispatch from Peiping dated September 27th in the English-language "China Press," four staff members of the English church hospital in Hejian were killed by Japanese soldiers, two nurses were raped, and three British staff members were also detained by Japanese soldiers. Two church hospitals in Hejian and Datong in Shanxi Province have been forcibly taken over by Japanese soldiers. These attacks are another step in the anti-British movement instigated by the Japanese in North China. Many churches and hospitals have withdrawn due to the anti-British movement endangering the lives of staff and patients. A large number of churches and hospitals in parts of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces have been forced to close. Only a few congregations are still operating. Two English church schools in Peiping have also been forced to close due to the anti-British movement.

### Eighth Route Army Recovers Anguo and Boye Counties; 10,000 Japanese Troops Rushed to Reinforce, but Were Ambushed

According to a Reuters dispatch from Baoding dated September 29th in the English-language "China Press," the Eighth Route Army intensified its operations, defeating the Japanese army last night and recovering the two major cities of Anguo and Boye, located 260 miles from Peiping. According to visitors from the battlefront, the Eighth Route Army moves unpredictably. The troops fought fiercely with the Japanese garrison in the area for three days, killing at least 700 Japanese soldiers and wounding 1,200. The fighting is still ongoing. 10,000 Japanese troops from Baoding and Dingxian rushed to reinforce, but were intercepted by the Eighth Route Army and divided into two sections before being ambushed. No fewer than fourteen Japanese trucks were burned in Hancun, not far from Anguo. The Eighth Route Army attacked Anguo directly from three sides. Only a few of the 2,000 Japanese troops stationed in the city managed to break through and flee to Baoding and Dingxian.

### Chinese Army in Jiaxing Briefly Reached the City Walls; Japanese Troops Strictly Search Passengers at the Railway Station and Wharf

Jiaxing Correspondence - The Chinese army, which arrived here from the south bank of the Qiantang River a few days ago, launched a fierce attack on the city in conjunction with the garrison from ××. A fierce battle took place with the Japanese troops in the Nanyan area (only two li from the city). After an hour of intense fighting, the Japanese troops, due to their weak forces, retreated into the city. The Chinese army advanced to the vicinity of the railway station. Subsequently, due to the arrival of Japanese reinforcements, the Chinese army retreated. To defend against the Chinese army, the Japanese troops have recently deployed soldiers to strictly search passengers at the train and boat wharfs. A man named Xu Ziqiao, who has been engaged in the grain business in Tangwan Town, recently gathered silk merchants in Shanghai to set up a factory in Tangwan to purchase cocoons due to the silkworm season. Xu traveled between Jiaxing and Shanghai to manage the business. However, a few days ago, when he brought over a thousand yuan from Shanghai to Jiaxing, he was intercepted and searched by Japanese soldiers at the railway station. The Japanese soldiers pointed out that the occupation listed on Xu's "Good Citizen Certificate" and "Pass" did not match, so he was arrested and repeatedly tortured, resulting in serious injuries. Subsequently, with the help of relatives and friends, a large sum of money was spent to secure his release. Because the troops of Xu Pucheng, the puppet pacification commander, had not been paid for three months, they have been defecting to the Chinese army authorities in ×××, bringing their weapons with them. Yesterday, six puppet soldiers surrendered with twelve rifles and were settled by a high-ranking officer who also rewarded them with 100 yuan in cash each.

The Japanese authorities here have recently sent traitorous merchants to various rice shops disguised as brokers to purchase new rice in order to replenish Japan's food shortage, causing rice prices to rise daily. It is said that the Chinese army authorities have ordered the garrisons in various places to strictly prohibit the import of agricultural products into the occupied areas.

Education News

### Ministry of Education Announces Revised School System Chart

(Special Chongqing Dispatch) The school system was first announced by the Ministry of Education in the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922) and amended by the National Education Conference in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928). At the National Education Conference in March of this year, the Ministry of Education, taking into account practical needs, revised the school system. The revised resolution was passed. The main points of this resolution were published in this newspaper. The Ministry of Education has announced the revised school system chart and related explanations, which are extracted below:

(A) Revised School System Chart I

(B) Various Resolutions and Explanations

(1) Within the secondary education stage, in addition to the existing 3-3 system secondary schools, a six-year secondary school will be established, without separation of junior and senior high school. Its curriculum will be determined separately. To encourage talented students from poor families to receive education, the six-year secondary school should provide more scholarships.

(Explanation) The original purpose of establishing secondary schools was primarily for further education, but the current 3-3 system secondary school cannot fully meet this requirement. In fact, many students entering junior and senior high school do not consider whether they can continue their education after graduation, resulting in a serious problem of what to do after graduation. In order to take into account practical needs, a six-year integrated secondary school is established, specifically for preparing for further education. Students in the original 3-3 system secondary school who cannot continue their education will be given various types of training so that they can find employment after graduation (see the Secondary Education Improvement Plan for details).

(2) In addition to establishing simple normal school courses, the original 3-3 system junior high school may also establish simple vocational courses to recruit junior high school graduates.

(3) Within the higher education stage, in addition to the existing two-year and three-year vocational schools, a five-year vocational school will be established, mainly focusing on art and music. It will recruit junior high school graduates and students with equivalent academic qualifications. (Explanation) The current vocational schools recruit high school graduates and students with equivalent academic qualifications, but in fact, because most high school graduates go on to universities, recruitment is difficult. However, junior high school graduates who want to receive vocational training have no schools to enter. In order to increase the function of vocational schools and meet practical needs, a five-year vocational school will be established to recruit junior high school graduates and students with equivalent academic qualifications, providing them with five years of integrated vocational training.

### Key Points for Implementing Required and Elective Courses for Various Departments of Universities Recently Announced by the Ministry of Education

(Special Chongqing Dispatch) The Ministry of Education recently announced the key points for implementing the table of required and elective courses for various departments of universities. The original text is as follows:

(1) The Ministry-approved table of required and elective courses for various departments of universities should be implemented by all institutions starting from the second year of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939). At the end of the academic year, they should submit the teaching syllabus for each course set up in accordance with the table. In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), the third and fourth grades should, as far as possible, refer to the Ministry-approved course table to set up required and elective courses.

(2) Departments composed of two combined disciplines, such as mathematics and physics, history and geography, philosophy and psychology, history and sociology, political science and economics, etc., may be taught in groups, with common and group-specific required and elective courses. Each institution should refer to the previously issued course tables for each department and submit them to the Ministry for approval.

(3) For departments for which required and elective course tables have not yet been promulgated, such as journalism, surveying, railway management, etc., each institution should formulate temporary course tables and submit them to the Ministry for approval.

(4) Party principles, physical education, and military training are, of course, required courses. In addition to setting them up in the first year, all departments from the second year onwards must still set up physical education and military training courses in accordance with the regulations.

(5) Students in the departments of the Colleges of Arts, Sciences, Commerce, and Agriculture, and the three departments of Political Science, Economics, and Sociology of the College of Law must complete at least 132 credits. Students in the departments of the College of Engineering and the Department of Law of the College of Law must complete at least 142 credits before they can graduate. If necessary, they may take additional credits, but the additional credits for the departments of the Colleges of Arts, Sciences, Commerce, and Agriculture, and the three departments of Political Science, Economics, and Sociology of the College of Law must not exceed ten credits, and the additional credits for the departments of the College of Engineering and the Department of Law of the College of Law must not exceed eight credits.

(6) The academic year and semester for the required courses listed in the required course table may be adjusted by each institution for convenience in scheduling, unless the order of the contents cannot be changed due to their sequential nature.

(7) The number of credits for each course listed in the required course table is the minimum and must not be reduced. Each institution may increase the number of credits depending on the available personnel and facilities.

(8) If necessary, each institution may, in addition to the Ministry-approved required courses for each department, add departmental or group-specific required courses, taking into account practical needs and available facilities, but this must be submitted to the Ministry for approval.

(9) The academic year, semester, and credits for the elective courses in each department may be changed by each institution for convenience in scheduling.

(10) Each institution may set up its own elective courses in addition to the Ministry-approved elective courses, but they must not exceed one-quarter of the total credits for elective courses in that department, and this must be submitted to the Ministry for approval.

(11) At the beginning of each academic year, each institution should, in accordance with the Ministry-approved course table, list the names, credits, and semesters of the required and elective courses set up in each department and report them to the Ministry for record.

(12) After the promulgation of the Ministry-approved course table, each institution must implement it. Graduating students who have not completed the required courses and met the required number of credits for each course will not be allowed to graduate.

### Lacks Wins Against North Xitong

In a friendly soccer match, Lacks played against North Xitong. The game started at 2:30 p.m. yesterday at Yiyuan, and lasted for 70 minutes. North Xitong had just been promoted from Group B to Group A this season, and their experience was relatively poor. The center back was Parker, a former star of the French Business Association.

This season was his first appearance, and his footwork was unfamiliar.

Lacks' performance also lacked coordination. Star player Fafan only played for half the game. In the first half, Lacks took a 2-1 lead. In the end, Lacks defeated North Xitong 5-3.

St. Portuguese Ties Three Goals Each

In another friendly match, St. Francis played against Portugal.

The game was held at the American Middle School yesterday afternoon. In the first half, Portugal took a 3-2 lead. In the second half, St. Francis scored one goal, while Portugal scored none. The result was a 3-3 draw. The reserve teams of St. Francis and Lacks competed at the same time at the Jinke Middle School Stadium. As a result, Francis won against Lacks. In the first half, the score was 1-0, with the St. team leading. This afternoon at 3 p.m., Lido will play against West Force again. There will still be a double match at the Zhendan Stadium.

There are still four soccer friendly matches to be played today. Lido will play against West Force at 3 p.m. at the Zhendan Stadium. The two teams played a match before, and the result was a 1-1 draw, so they can be called evenly matched. This time they have decided to meet again. Lido, riding the momentum of yesterday's victory over East Celle, will definitely be able to defeat the enemy. It is expected that the battle will be more intense than before. Before the game, the West Police team will play against the Sookel team. The West Police team is making its first appearance this season, but they should be able to handle the mediocre Sookel team with ease. Tickets are the same as yesterday, still selling for 7 cents (including refugee donation). At 10:30 a.m., the French Business Association will play against St. Francis. The French Business Association has few people this season and is likely not an opponent for the St. team. At 3:15 p.m., the Lacks reserve team will play against McKell at Nie Zhongcheng Middle School Stadium. Today's schedule is as follows:

St. Francis vs. French Business Association 10:30 a.m. Yiyuan

### Finance Export Trade Increases, Foreign Exchange Gradually Loosens

Foreign Exchange Market Yesterday: HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The unofficial exchange rates for British and American currencies remained stable, mainly because of the recent major victories of the Chinese army at the front lines, and reports of military victories near Nanchang. Therefore, many parties were cautious. Telegrams from Hong Kong and Sassoon successively offered to sell foreign exchange. Additionally, according to recent customs statistics, there were large exports of silk, tea, and eggs, leading to more sellers offering foreign exchange. However, foreign banks like HSBC had good appetite for absorbing these offers, so the market's loosening trend was缓和. The highest buying price for British gold by major banks was 士 five six two five at 四辦, and for US dollars it was seven yuan six two five. However, the afternoon closing prices were 士 five one five six two five at 四辦, and seven yuan five six two five, respectively. Consequently, the British rate was looser than the American rate, influenced by the continued slight decrease of one and a half points in the US-to-UK exchange rate. The trends for October and November were mixed, but overall, they were slightly extended. According to the afternoon closing prices, the distance between British gold for October and November was 〇七八一二五, and the difference for US dollars was 一五六二五, approximately equal to a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of only 二分 one 釐. However, in reality, it was difficult for arbitrageurs to profit. Trading was flat throughout the day.

Sassoon Continues to Offer

Early in the morning, London's main market saw a sharp increase of 一辦士 three five in both near and far-term rates. New York silver prices rose 一二五. London bullion remained stable. Exchange rates for British currency against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. US currency decreased by 一分 half against British currency, remained unchanged against Shanghai currency, and decreased slightly by 一二五 against French currency. Central Bank listed rates for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling prices in the morning: British gold at 士 four six eight seven five at 四辦, and US dollars at seven yuan half, with no gains or losses compared to the previous closing. After opening, Hong Kong first sent a telegram offering to sell, and Western merchant Sassoon followed suit. Therefore, the situation was stable with a firm undertone. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegram and Sassoon sold spot British gold at 士 half at 四辦, and spot US dollars at seven yuan five three 一二五 and five six 二五 to a certain bank. Later, after HSBC's listed rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced at 大七分, foreign firms pawned off spot US dollars at seven yuan five three 一二五 to a certain bank. However, exporters frequently offered to sell soon after, so the situation was stable with a firm undertone. It is estimated that exporters sold spot British gold at 士 half and five six 二五 at 四辦, and sold spot US dollars from seven yuan five six 二五 to six 二五 to foreign banks like Chase Bank and Banque de l'Indochine. Subsequently, the selling trend gradually subsided, causing the situation to become increasingly calm.

British gold for this month was 士 half at 四辦, and US dollars at seven yuan five three 一二五. British gold for November was 士 four three seven five at 四辦, and US dollars at seven yuan four 〇六 二五.

### Gold Market: Hong Kong Gang Still Absorbing

Yesterday, the cash gold market initially showed signs of weakness in the unofficial market. Although the foreign exchange trend slightly loosened in the morning, and news of victories near Nanchang spread throughout the market, the gold price remained unmoved and even rose. However, there were major underlying reasons for this. The Hong Kong gang relentlessly purchased from morning to noon, indicating strong supporting power. Throughout the day, the market opened slightly weak at four thousand and fifty-five yuan due to the firm foreign exchange rate. Although the foreign exchange rate loosened later, a certain bullion shop and a money exchange business, acting on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, aggressively purchased, pushing the price up to a peak of four thousand and sixty-seven yuan at one point. The market closed at four thousand and sixty-six yuan, a gain of six yuan compared to the previous day. However, a certain gold firm took the opportunity to sell on behalf of multiple parties, causing a temporary pullback. Ultimately, demand exceeded supply, so it was difficult to maintain. The market was closed in the afternoon due to Saturday. It was reported that unofficial trading was still taking place. The market sentiment suddenly shifted due to the rumor that Mr. Soong was appointed as the ambassador to the United States, which was widely believed to greatly support China's finances. This caused the Hong Kong gang's appetite to turn sluggish, and the situation became unsustainable. It was reported that the price had fallen back to within the four thousand and fifty yuan range. Trading was still active for half the day, with approximately eight or nine hundred taels traded. The price of gold ornaments in bullion shops remained unchanged throughout the day. The prices of customs gold and other gold remained stable.

The Fluctuations of Refined Gold Were Only Twelve Yuan

Since the morning, for each bar (ten taels), the market initially showed slight weakness due to the firm foreign exchange rate, opening down by five yuan. Securities firms sold twenty taels to gold firms for four thousand and fifty-five yuan. After the opening, the market became stable as the Hong Kong gang became active. Bullion shops took in thirty taels from money exchange businesses and securities firms took in ten taels from gold firms, all at four thousand and fifty-eight yuan. Soon after, securities firms sold back twenty taels to a certain bullion shop for four thousand and fifty-seven yuan. At the time, a certain money exchange business took in over two hundred taels from fellow businesses and bullion shops for four thousand and fifty-eight yuan and sixty yuan. Simultaneously, a certain bullion shop also took in thirty taels from fellow businesses for four thousand and sixty yuan. Although the Hong Kong gang's buying remained strong, the market price slightly declined as a certain gold firm tended to sell on behalf of clients, and the foreign exchange rate continued to loosen. Bullion shops sold twenty taels to securities firms for a price of four thousand and fifty-nine yuan. A certain gold firm forcefully sold over a hundred taels to a certain bullion shop, with the price falling from four thousand and fifty-eight yuan to fifty-six yuan. Subsequently, the willingness of sellers gradually waned, and a certain money exchange business resumed buying on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, so the situation turned upward again, rebounding by four yuan. A certain bullion shop took in ten taels from gold firms, with the price being four thousand and sixty yuan. Immediately following this, the price rose by another three yuan, and a certain money exchange business took in twenty taels from bullion shops for a price of four thousand and sixty-three yuan. Later, bullion shops and money exchange businesses frequently offered to sell, temporarily pushing the price down to four thousand and fifty-nine yuan. However, a certain bullion shop soon began buying again, and gold firms slightly followed suit, immediately raising the price by seven yuan. A certain bullion shop took in ten taels from money exchange businesses, with the price being four thousand and sixty-six yuan. As cash gold firms sold actively, the price fell back by four yuan. Money exchange businesses traded ten taels amongst themselves for four thousand and sixty-two yuan. At noon, as a certain bullion shop began buying again, the market sentiment turned firm again, raising the price by five yuan. A certain bullion shop took in twenty taels from cash gold firms, with the price being four thousand and sixty-seven yuan. Following this, money exchange businesses took in ten taels from securities firms, with the closing price being four thousand and sixty-six yuan. As a result, the price gained six yuan compared to the previous day. The fluctuations were only twelve yuan for half the day. The selling price of the cash gold firms' branded gold was ten yuan higher than the price of refined gold, and the buying price was approximately thirty yuan lower. The cash price was over fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.

Gold Ornaments in Bullion Shops Remained Unchanged

The exchange rate for gold ornaments in bullion shops, per tael, rarely fluctuated with refined gold, so it remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang listed at four hundred and ten yuan, the same price as Xin Tong Hang. The buying price was approximately twenty yuan lower.

### Main Market Soared— 一便士 Two Five—

London, 6th: The main market silver market saw Indian and speculative buyers, with limited supply, leading to a sharp increase of 一辦士 two five in both near and far-term rates. The market situation was flat. There were no major transactions after closing. Also, according to a New York telegram, the price of American silver rose 一二五, with the spot price at three 角 five 分 一二五. Also, according to a Bombay telegram, both current and future Indian silver prices rose sharply by 一羅比 〇五安那. The market situation was flat, with a total of fifty contracts traded.

### Discount Rate Declines

Yesterday, the discount rate for accepted drafts suddenly declined. In the morning, it was still around seventy yuan per thousand, but it suddenly fell to sixty-seven yuan and fifty cents in the afternoon, two yuan and a half lower than the previous day. The interbank lending rate quoted by the Money Industry Association was 一角 nine 分 for both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Foreign Currencies Fall One After Another

Yesterday, foreign currencies, after repeated selling by exporters in the exchange market, found it increasingly difficult to rebound. The sentiment among fellow businesses was also pessimistic, leading to active selling with a sense of oversupply. As a result, the British gold pound fell by 五角, the British gold note decreased by 三角, and US notes decreased slightly by 一角 half. Hong Kong notes fell by 二分, the French franc note decreased by 二厘, and the Canadian note decreased by 一角. The Japanese gold note and the Korean note saw a severe decline, with the former decreasing by slightly 二分 and the latter also decreasing by 一分 five 厘.

### Securities: Northern Hunan Battle Improves, Domestic Bonds Surge, Foreign Stocks Also Active

Yesterday, the securities unofficial market continued to show a strong trend, with prices rising steadily in both the morning and afternoon. Since the news of the improved battle situation in Northern Hunan, the sentiment of the bulls has risen, not only unwilling to sell but also adding positions. There were few scattered retail investors taking profits. The trend was stronger in the afternoon. Class A bonds pierced through fifty-five yuan, Class B bonds pierced through forty-eight yuan, Class C and E bonds both broke through the seven-yuan mark, and Class D bonds, due to the upcoming lottery, broke through both the six-yuan and seven-yuan marks. The situation was excellent. All parties believed that Class C, D, and E bonds would soon break through the fifty-yuan mark. Yesterday morning, the prices were firm, rising by 三五角. The news was even better in the afternoon, and all bonds broke through the one-yuan mark. Class C bonds, due to the lottery on the ninth, were priced based on the ex-lottery price starting from the ninth. Yesterday afternoon, there were two markets, with the price difference between the cum-lottery and ex-lottery prices being around half a yuan. The market price resulted in a continued increase of 六角 to 一元二角. The total transaction volume was approximately one million yuan. A summary table is listed below.

Stock Transactions: Fifty shares of the Bank of China were traded at a price of fifty-three yuan.

The Industry Association also reported that the activity in the stock market yesterday did not diminish, and new high prices appeared for various well-known stocks. It seems that a considerable amount of capital has flowed into the market recently, likely due to the reduced scope of speculation in other markets, leading people to join the stock market. Taking the exchange market as an example, the difference between near and far-term rates was previously very large, offering arbitrageurs a very high interest rate. However, the exchange rate has gradually converged, and there is no longer much attraction. The large amount of capital used for arbitrage at that time has now been diverted to various industrial stocks, which is to be expected.

London, 6th: Today's listed prices for British merchant Far East company stocks still included several types such as the Shanghai Waterworks, with stable prices and no changes.

London, 6th: Today's foreign prices for Chinese stocks still included four types such as Sino-French and American gold, with stable listed prices and no changes.

Lever Brothers Declares Dividend

Lever Brothers (China) Limited, a British merchant company in this city, decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay an interim dividend for 1939 starting from October 13th, at one yuan in national currency per share.

### Grains: Domestic Rice Rises and Then Returns to Flat, Customer purchases five thousand bags

The declining trend in the rice market has stabilized. Over four thousand bags of goods arrived from Qingjiao and Sujia via train, and there were reports of shortages along the river. Therefore, after the decline, the local stores took action, leading to a tightening of the early market, with prices rising by more than half a yuan. However, given the sharp fluctuations in the market recently, businesses were inevitably wary, so the market loosened again in the afternoon, resulting in a situation that was initially tight and then soft. The closing prices were: Zhente Changxi broken rice at forty-one yuan to forty yuan, middle grade at thirty-five yuan, and lower grade at thirty-three yuan; Changzhou white broken rice at thirty-eight yuan, middle grade at thirty-four yuan five yuan; new glutinous rice at three yuan thirteen yuan; Su Tong Kun broken glutinous rice at thirty-three yuan four yuan, new glutinous rice at thirty-one yuan two yuan; Qingjiao Lvzhong at thirty-two yuan, Mizhong at thirty-one yuan to thirty yuan, Fengjia Baige at thirty yuan to twenty-eight yuan and a half; Songjiang thin broken rice at thirty-three yuan four yuan, special Yangjian at twenty-five yuan, Jiaowei at twenty-three yuan, special Lujian at twenty-six yuan, lower grade at twenty-four yuan and a half, Jiangbei Jian at twenty yuan, Jiaowei at nineteen yuan and a half, Wuhu white Jian at twenty yuan zero six jiao, middle grade at twenty yuan to nineteen yuan and a half, Jiaowei at eighteen yuan eight jiao to eighteen yuan and a half, 砶jian at eighteen yuan to seventeen yuan and a half, Chen bian yuan at thirty-two yuan three yuan, new yuan at thirty yuan to twenty-nine yuan seven jiao. The total trading volume was over seven thousand bags.

Another report: The customer glutinous rice market has stabilized. After repeated sharp declines in rice prices, vendors found the costs high and transportation unprofitable, so future sources may decrease. There were also reports that the procurement permits in Jiangbei would expire on the 11th of this month and would not be extended, so the market sentiment returned to flat. Since customer glutinous rice prices were low, 砶 rice at eighteen yuan and machine rice at nineteen yuan suited the needs of the countryside, inland, and the city. The trading volume increased to over five thousand bags, and the high prices of various grades immediately increased by 二三角. However, over six thousand bags of Wuhu rice arrived yesterday.

### Flour: Customer Sales Sharply Decrease, Wheat Shows Low Supply and Demand, Inventory Around 400,000 Bags

Flour: Yesterday's spot flour trading was even more flat. Customer sales have sharply decreased because of the current difficulties in stacking flour in factories and warehouses and the issue of additional loss fees. Customers can only purchase based on shipping availability. Small-scale retail trading in the city has also decreased. However, factories still require the original plate price of seven yuan and are unwilling to loosen it, so the sellers seeking to sell recycled goods are not as eager as in the previous two days. It is reported that the price for old car brands is six yuan seven jiao half to seven yuan, and the prices for Bingshipai and Hong Lan Fuxin are six yuan six jiao seven jiao. The total number of bags traded by local customers was over two thousand bags. The market changes will depend on the beginning of next week.

Wheat: Yesterday, both the supply and demand for wheat were low. The sources from various regions totaled five to six thousand bags. Since the Shanghai market price declined, vendors have been decreasing daily. However, the production price is still high, and sellers are unwilling to sell cheaply. Yesterday's factory demand was flat. Outside speculators inquired slightly. The current wheat inventory is approximately four hundred thousand bags. With the voice of foreign wheat sources being unsustainable, the market is unlikely to decline, and will likely remain stable. Fuxin and Fufeng factories jointly handled a total of one thousand two hundred bags of Chang, Xi, Jing, Su, and other wheats, and scattered stockpiles absorbed three to four truckloads, priced at nine yuan eight jiao to nine yuan. The market was.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Reaches New High Price

Soybean oil has recently seen a lack of sources, stockpilers adding positions, and rumors spreading, leading to opportunists taking advantage of the situation and aggressively raising prices. As the market continues to move forward, it reached a new high price yesterday. Kobe oil opened at seventy-four yuan eight jiao, with eighty barrels traded. Dalian oil closed at seventy-three yuan five jiao, with a total of fifty barrels traded. Jiaozhou oil reached forty-seven yuan, with a total of one hundred and seventy pieces opened. Yantai oil was forty-seven yuan eight jiao for fifty pieces, Qingqi oil was forty-six yuan two jiao, with fifty pieces traded, and canned white oil was three hundred cans, priced at sixty-three yuan. For peanut oil, Hong Kong parties handled one thousand four hundred cans of Qingdao canned oil, priced at seventy-five yuan five jiao. The market is in a stable state, with no special changes.

### Coal: Hongji Coal Arrives Again with Over 2,000 Tons

Hongji coal has arrived continuously in recent days. Yesterday, another two thousand two hundred and forty tons arrived, transported by the Taikoo Company on the Suzhou ship. It was imported yesterday afternoon and docked at the wharf outside the French Concession.

### Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Too Sluggish, Yarn Market Lacks Momentum

The yarn market has begun to decline. The trends are disordered and inconsistent. Due to sluggish actual sales, weak market sentiment, and large amounts of unsupported settlements, the market is even more sluggish. However, major players still absorb when prices fall and do not release their holdings. As for customer groups and the Hong Kong group, the desire to buy cheap goods arises again when prices decline, so they are currently hesitant. The fundamental problem is that actual trading is too sluggish, and the ability to rise is weak. As for a large decline, it is also because the factory foundations are not loose, and there is an attitude of hesitation.

The atmosphere in the spot yarn market was very weak in the morning, and some were selling at lower prices. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma spot was 720 yuan, a large decrease of 20 yuan from the previous day. The warehouse receipt price was still flat, only slightly lower by 七八 yuan. Soon, buyers rushed in due to the low price, and the Guang group also came to pull in, jumping ten yuan to 735 yuan. The warehouse receipt price was 715 yuan. By the time of closing, there were rumors of improved military situation in Nanchang, and the market sentiment rose, rising another three or four yuan. The spot price for Shuangma was 742 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 720 yuan. The half-day trading statistics showed 945 bags traded. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by five jiao, Tiannv remained unchanged, Shuangdiqiu fell by one yuan, and Muyang fell by eleven yuan. The Shenxin factory opened with 550 bags of 10-count Tongzijun, priced at 590 yuan, and 200 bags of 32-count Tiannv, priced at 850 yuan. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below.

Hong Kong 130 Fellow businesses 595
Inland 220 Statistics 945
Previous Day's Trading 150 Total 1,695

### Tong Tai Cotton Fell by 3-4 Yuan

The cotton business's trading volume was still not weak. However, the selling price was affected by the temporary congestion of arrivals and declined. Whether this source can continue to be smooth is still a question. Today, the price of cotton fell by 二三 yuan for Tonghua and 三四 yuan for Taicanghua. Chinese factories have not changed their prices. However, Japanese factories are buying 400 pieces of Indian cotton. 5,698 packages of Tongdan flowers from Subei arrived, and 2,709 packages from Changyinsha arrived. The current situation of spot cotton is listed on the left.

New Tonghua 145.0 over 1,000 packages from fellow businesses
Taicanghua 142.0 and another 300 packages
Hui Sideng 180.0 Dakang 200 pieces
Pengjiapu 182.0 and another 200 pieces

In addition, foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has become very loose recently, and fellow businesses have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The factories are also relaxing their purchasing efforts due to rumors. However, the factory's inventory is not thick. The cost of transporting Indian cotton to China will increase by 20% next month. Currently, there are many Brazilian cotton arrivals in the market, and the price is very cheap, making it a good time to purchase cheap cotton. According to various opinions, exchange rates are unlikely to rise again in the future, so fellow businesses with inventory are unwilling to sell.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market rose in the morning due to purchases by fellow businesses. Liverpool's telegram reported a rise. The spot trading market has been very firm recently due to the increased demand from the Far East, and exporters have been quite active, also rising by over ten pounds. Later, the market suddenly fell back due to the emergence of long positions. As a result, the closing price was still up by 五六 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market was very quiet. The Egyptian cotton market fell by over ten pounds yesterday. Liverpool rose by five pence.

### Silk and Tea: Zhili Silk Sees Slight Trading, Selling Price Rises by Approximately 30 Yuan

Recently, the domestic silk market has been very quiet for white factory silk. Most silk factories in this city can now continue to operate without being affected by raw materials, accounting for a very small number of factories. Therefore, most of the spot goods are still held by the factories, waiting for a good price. Although Yokohama silk prices have reported a rise of 35 yuan, Shanghai silk trading has not yet started. The Zhili silk market once showed signs of prosperity the week before, but also due to the lack of inventory in the interior, and the even greater shortage of upper-grade silk, the Zhili silk trading for six numbers is also in a stalemate. Yesterday, only Zhili middle-grade and lower-grade silk were sold for 100+ loads, priced at 1,680 yuan, a rise of approximately 30 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate Indefinitely

There were not many foreign sugar transactions yesterday, and there was another decline. The association's market price was 1.40 for coarse white sugar, with local warehouses at 54.5 yuan and foreign warehouses initially at 55 yuan, then falling to 54.4 yuan. Re-export goods were still at 42.5 yuan. Taikoo's car white was down two jiao, with East Warehouse's B mark at 59 yuan, West Warehouse's C W mark at 58.8 yuan, C X mark at 58.3 yuan, D J mark at 57.8 yuan, H X mark at 57.3 yuan, and H mark's car red was down five jiao, at 42.7 yuan, He Red at 44 yuan, down two jiao. Local cotton white was down half a yuan, with Zhenji No. 1 at 55.5 yuan, No. 2 at 55 yuan, No. 3 at 54.5 yuan, and No. 4 at 54 yuan. Local ice was down one yuan, with No. 1 at 66.5 yuan and Jing Ming brand at 68 yuan. National Sugar Xinghua Red and White has not yet been reported, and there is still a lack of formal market, and it is bound to be difficult to be too high.

### Dried Goods: New Xingyuan Osmanthus Fruit Agreed Prices High

The new Xinghua goods of dried osmanthus fruit have been high in cost since their arrival, and have not loosened. Agreed prices have already been opened. The full price for the authentic brand is 168 yuan, the barrel is 167 yuan, the authentic second is 163 yuan, the third is 125 yuan, Xingji is 105 yuan, and the fourth round is 135 yuan. Cold-stored old goods differ by more than 10 yuan to 10 yuan. Old goods that have been baked again are reduced by another 11 to 12 yuan to 5 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Velvet Is the Only Strong Performer, Many Others Are Falling

National Cloth: Yesterday's market continued to fall. As the Hong Kong authorities added controls on foreign exchange, and exchange rates soared, Singapore and other places adopted the same measures, so the purchasing situation for the Hong Kong group and the Southeast Asian group was sluggish. The remaining locations reduced their purchases due to the falling market price, so trading was very quiet. The local street and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang inland groups had extremely prosperous trading due to the development of autumn sales, so velvet was the strongest among the current sales goods, and the market price rose by two jiao and a half to five jiao per piece. There is a shortage of spot goods, and the brushed factories are rushing to deliver goods day and night. Fine cloth and fine twill had little trading, and the price per piece fell by 二三角. Rough cloth and rough twill had over 200 packages purchased in this street, and the price fell by 五分 to 一角. There was extremely little trading in colored cloth and colored twill, and the wholesale shops were doing their best to sell off inventory, with no buying. Spring light-colored goods such as satin, plain crepe, and bleached twill were hoarded by customers from the Sichuan-Tianjin and Yangtze River groups, and the spot inventory was low, creating a great rarity.

Dongbu: The declining trend of white goods and fine twill has not ended. Yesterday, the price continued to fall by 二角半 to 五角 per piece. The spot price for 12-pound Longpiao fine cloth fell to 21.5 yuan per piece, Yanghe fine cloth was 21 yuan, and Longtou fine twill was 20.075 yuan. The market price is getting softer and the trend is becoming more stagnant. Customers rarely purchase, but fellow traders on this street are calm and still hoard when prices are low, so the total number of pieces traded throughout the day was approximately 六七 hundred pieces.

### The Japanese Army Feels Uneasy; A Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Derailed Again Yesterday; A Landmine Exploded in Chang'an, Xiashi; Dozens of Passengers Killed and Injured; Chinese Troops Reportedly Captured Zhapu

The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines have always been strongholds relied upon by the Japanese army as the lifeline of transportation. Recently, Chinese guerrillas have been active everywhere. Last month, the railway tracks at Zhaze and Henglin on the Shanghai-Nanjing line were destroyed. Earlier this month, another train derailed at Longtan. Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, there have been frequent encounters everywhere, making it impossible for the Japanese army to cope. Yesterday, a passenger train derailed again between Chang'an and Xiashi stations in Haiyan County. More than a dozen Japanese were killed or injured, and twenty to thirty Chinese passengers were killed or injured. In addition, Chinese troops attacked near Xin Feng and Changzhou stations on the Shanghai-Nanjing line. There are reports that Zhapu in Zhejiang Province has been captured by Chinese troops. The details are as follows:

Landmine Explosion

At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a regular passenger train heading from Hangzhou to Shanghai encountered a landmine planted by Chinese troops as it approached Chang'an Station and continued east towards Xiashi. With a loud bang, the locomotive and first- and second-class carriages at the front of the train immediately derailed. At that time, four vehicles were damaged. After most of the passengers were excessively shaken, clear sounds of rifles and machine guns were heard from near the railway tracks, continuing incessantly. A small number of Japanese troops stationed there rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese guerrillas. The gunfire gradually subsided after more than half an hour. The Chinese troops, having accomplished their mission, also withdrew.

Many Killed and Injured

While the two armies were engaged in fierce battle, most of the uninjured passengers on the train crawled into the dense woods to avoid stray bullets. When the Chinese troops withdrew, they saw five or six Japanese dead and more than a dozen injured. Several Chinese passengers were killed and more than twenty injured. Scattered items from the luggage car attached to the train were also scattered all over the ground. The injured passengers groaned and cried in pain. The Chinese troops also fought bravely, with one person sacrificing on the spot. Later, Hangzhou Railway Station heard the news and urgently sent mechanics and another passenger train to the scene of the accident to move the derailed vehicles to the side of the road and repair the tracks. The passengers changed trains one after another and continued east. They arrived in Shanghai from Chang'an with passengers at about 3:00 PM. The injured Chinese passengers have been sent to Japanese hospitals for treatment.

Frequent Good News

The guerrillas in the Jiangnan area are now launching a general offensive in October. There are more than 100,000 regular guerrilla troops fighting on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines.

Those on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, Xiashi, Jiaxing, and Pinghu, are all surrounded. The port of Zhapu has been recaptured, and all Japanese troops have withdrawn. Jiashan has been destroyed. Although it has been repaired, the entire area is controlled by guerrillas. There are daily reports of puppet troops in various places turning against the Japanese.

### A Charity Bazaar at an English Girls' School; More Than a Thousand People Attended; The Results Were Extremely Satisfactory

The charity bazaar to help the poor and sick at Renji Hospital was held at the English Girls' School on Haig Road yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM.

Unprecedented Grand Occasion

Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the English Girls' School was crowded with people. More than 900 Westerners and more than 100 Chinese attended, an unprecedented event after the war. The bazaar was set up in the school's classrooms.

The guests were all charitable, buying very enthusiastically regardless of the price of the items.

A Variety of Performances

The entertainments included Chinese string puppet shows, Peking Opera gongs and drums, which were very popular with Westerners, one-yuan lotteries, one-yuan raffles, and various children's games, which were participated in by purchasing tickets, such as ball throwing, toy digging in sand-filled wooden boxes, shadow puppetry, Beijing dough figurines, and sliding competitions. The school's playground was filled with chairs and tables for guests to use for refreshments. British women dressed as Scottish country girls, holding food to sell, wearing tall hats and long clothes, which added to the fun. A Western orchestra of more than thirty people played from time to time. The music was melodious. The guests dispersed happily at about 6:00 PM, and all returned fully loaded, with no one returning empty-handed.

Relief for the Poor and Sick

At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, Mrs. Mossa伯, the British Judge, and Mrs. Liu Wu Zhuosheng, the president of the Women's Auxiliary Association, gave speeches successively, explaining that the proceeds from this charity sale would be donated to the Women's Auxiliary Association to help the poor and needy Chinese who visit and are hospitalized at Renji Hospital. They hoped that the guests would be charitable and purchase enthusiastically.

A charity sale must be held every year. This year is the second time. Last year's charity sale raised more than 3,000 yuan. This time, because there were so many guests, the income is expected to be huge.

### The Japanese Army Actually Invaded AoJiang; Chinese Troops Fought Back and Repelled Them; Attempt to Block the Navigation Route of Pipa Mountain; The Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Forces Have Deployed Heavy Troops

According to reliable information from the shipping industry, after the Japanese side declared that military operations would be carried out in AoJiang, 30 miles south of Wenzhou, from the morning of the 6th, two Japanese warships sailed into the sea area of AoJiang Pipa Mountain at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. They put down four motorboats, carrying Japanese soldiers to invade the SanShaBu River bank. The local garrison rose up to fight back and fired with machine guns. After half an hour of fierce fighting, the Japanese boats could not hold on and fled back to the warships. As of last night, they had not invaded again, but the Japanese warships were still returning and staying, not leaving. Observing their purpose, they attempted to block the north-south navigation of AoJiang Pipa Mountain with obstacles. Along the coast of AoJiang, the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander has deployed heavy troops.

Japanese Planes Bomb; Minimal Damage

At 1:40 PM on September 25, Pingyang County in AoJiang was bombed by three Japanese planes. Four bombs were dropped on the banks of AoJiang, one of which was an incendiary bomb, which landed near the Chenfu Temple. Two bombs landed in Zhongbu and Shangbu, and another bomb landed in the Shengpinglou Restaurant. Fortunately, there was no major damage to the local area. The next day, three more Japanese planes circled and scouted the Jiang area. As for the blockade line of AoJiang, it is very solid, so it is by no means easy for the Japanese army to land at Gu'aotou and invade Pingyang. Moreover, the highways connecting Pingyang and Yongjia have long been destroyed.

Blessed to Arrive in Shanghai; Navigation Cut Off

The British Yilong Company's Shenyou Wheel loaded cargo from Gu'aotou on the 3rd and sailed to Shanghai, and it arrived only at 8:00 AM yesterday. The ship was fortunately peaceful along the way. In order to avoid danger, the shipping companies have decided to temporarily suspend navigation on this route.

### National Day Commemoration with Hanging Flags; Temporary Security Measures in the Concessions; Municipal Council and Various Agencies Closed; Police and Detectives in Both Concessions Strengthened Prevention

All sectors of the city will commemorate National Day the day after tomorrow. During this extraordinary period, in accordance with the Central Government's clear orders, there will be no extravagant celebrations and no ceremonies will be held. However, in order to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs for their great achievements in creating the republic and establishing the Republic of China, flags will be hung for one day in accordance with the arrangements of various groups and both governments. All agencies in the city, such as the Municipal Council, the Postal Bureau, the courts at all levels in the Special Zone, various schools, and various groups, will also close as usual to celebrate. At the same time, the police authorities in the rainy concessions, in order to prevent incidents and maintain law and order within the boundaries, will implement temporary security measures on that day. All police officers in the various police stations have been ordered to cooperate fully and to increase patrols to inspect pedestrians and vehicles on the roads. Prevention will be further strengthened in the areas beyond the boundaries of western Shanghai.

Security Measures Taken as Usual

The Shanghai Times reported that less than three weeks after the anniversary of the September 18th Shenyang Incident, the police and military authorities in both concessions were yesterday (the 6th) drafting plans for the security measures to be taken on Double Ten Day. It is heard that the security measures taken on Double Ten Day will be similar to those taken on July 7th and September 18th, and their scope will not be greater than that taken on August 13th this year.

Obstacles Set Up at Key Road Intersections

Although the complete plan for security measures has not yet been drafted, it is heard that barbed wire obstacles will be erected at the intersections of the roads around the city and connecting Edward Road and Avenue Foch. All personnel of the police departments of both concessions will not be allowed to take leave for 24 hours on that day. Foreign troops will cooperate with the police authorities of both concessions as usual to maintain law and order and to assume defense duties.

Merchant Corps and Garrison Troops Join the Alert

Members of the Russian detachment of the International Merchant Corps will serve in the Central and Old Zha districts and will add truck patrols. The British West Yorkshire Regiment, the East Surrey Regiment, the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment, and the Italian Marine Corps will all participate in the security plan in the Public Concession. In the French Concession, three French battalions will assist the police department in carrying out security.

### The Quick News Agency Chief Talks About the Photography Incident; The Japanese Reporter Was Too Bored; No Protest Planned

Two Japanese reporters from the Japanese-language Continental News and one Korean reporter suddenly sneaked to the front of the British Quick News Agency the night before yesterday to take pictures. After being discovered, they were arrested by the police and sent to the police station, and then released. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the reporter went to the Quick News Agency to meet with the president, Mr. 英眾弗利脫. Mr.弗利 said that the reporter from the Continental News was incredibly stupid. Why didn't they notify me in advance about what they wanted to do? If they had asked me to take pictures, I would have agreed. Why did they have to act out this comedy? The reporter asked, "Will you protest against this action by the Japanese?" Mr.弗利 replied, "Why bother? They have already made an excellent free advertisement for our company. I am satisfied." Mr.弗利 also said that people from the Continental News had visited our company three times in the past two days. The first time was the night before last, when the newspaper sent a representative to tell me not to pay the fees for the Continental News to people who were not sent by the newspaper. The second time was two hours before the invasion and photography, when a bill collector from the Continental News came to collect the newspaper fees from our newspaper. I wanted to prove that he was really sent by the newspaper, so I called to inquire, confirmed that it was correct, and paid the money. Then came the third action (photography). The two of them lit magnesium lights and quickly tried to take a picture, then ran away, but were arrested by the Central Police Station. I asked them why they invaded the area. They replied that they came to try to take a picture of an anti-Japanese telegraph machine.

### The Reason Why the Deyao Wheel Stopped Sailing; The Japanese Said There Were Guerrillas on Board; The Shipowner Said It Was a Debt Dispute

The Portuguese merchant Yihua Company's Deyao Wheel, which runs between Shanghai and Beisha, was detained by the Japanese-commanded puppet police at the Lujiazui River the day before yesterday morning after loading passengers and goods from Qinglonggang to Shanghai. It was taken to the fishing market to dock. It is learned that the Portuguese 利國, the superintendent of Yihua Company, had negotiated with the Japanese side yesterday morning. The reason given by the Japanese side for the detention was that guerrillas were mixed in among the crew, and they would only be released after the investigation was clear. According to the company's news, the passengers and goods on the ship have been unloaded at the fishing market and transferred to Shanghai. According to the shipowner's news, the ship has temporarily stopped sailing for one or two shifts due to a debt dispute. The rumors that it was detained are actually a misunderstanding.

### The Golden Gate Exposition Ends Early

The Universal Golden Gate Exposition, initiated by the mayor of San Francisco, USA, officially opened on Treasure Island on February 18 this year. Countries along the Pacific coast participated in the exhibition. Our government did not officially participate because it was during the war of resistance. Only Chinese merchants and overseas Chinese automatically participated in the name of manufacturers. The conference was originally scheduled for one year. Due to the shadow of the European War, the Universal Golden Gate Exposition was ended early on the 29th of this month.

### Charity Dance Competition

The Charity Dance Competition, organized by the Dance Hall Group Fundraising Committee of the Refugee Relief Association of this city, has been held successively in Yunshang, Paramount, Metropolitan, and other dance halls. The fourth decision is to hold it at the Lido Garden Dance Hall on Medhurst Road, starting at 4:00 PM today. Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng have been invited to give speeches. All the red stars of the dance industry and the members of the Women's Friendship Association are enthusiastically participating in the dance. There are also six Western famous song and dance performances, which are very grand and colorful. Tickets are two yuan per person, and all proceeds will be donated.

### Unfavorable Exchange Rate; Imports and Exports Are Declining; Opinions of U.S. Department of Commerce Personnel; It Is Also Difficult to Export Domestic Products Overseas

The Continental Daily News reported that the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office has received dozens of inquiries from Shanghai importers in the past two weeks, inquiring about news about German products. These products were previously shipped from Germany, but now, due to the war, they can no longer be obtained from Germany. In peacetime, this is a sign of the prosperity of U.S. exports. However, according to the opinion of personnel from the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office yesterday (the 6th), there is little hope for a large increase in trade between the two sides of the Pacific. The reason is that the unfavorable exchange rate makes it very expensive to ship overseas goods here and pay in foreign currencies. Therefore, only a small amount of goods can be shipped at a time, and orders will be placed again after the inventory is sold. The Chinese war has added more unfavorable factors to the import and export trade situation in this city. Although Chinese merchants who had prosperous trade during the last war hope that this trade will prosper again, they cannot now obtain Chinese products from the interior to export overseas. Japanese merchants, who had great success in trade with the United States during the previous war, are now hampered by their country's wartime needs.

### Indica Rice Enters the 20 Yuan Mark; Rice Prices Are Unclear; Purchase of Foreign Rice Suspended; 斛司 Asks to Inspect Rice, 米業 Refuses

Recently, the amount of rice transported to Shanghai from various places has increased compared to the previous month, and sales have become clearer, with a gradual increase in the bottom line. People's hearts are stable. At the rice shops and tea houses, sellers are suppressing prices to sell. People's hearts are looking small. Indica and japonica rice have all fallen in price. The market opened as usual at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Although there were many people who went to the market's public sample office to take samples, the transactions were quite light. Sales in this street are not good. Representatives of traveling merchants are offering prices to buy and sell. The selling price of 米業 is 17.5 yuan, and the top price of new Pudong rice is 32 yuan. The selling price of Wuhu rice has fallen into the price limit set by the former concession authorities.

Large Quantities of Indica and Japonica Rice Are About to Arrive in Shanghai

According to the news from the rice market yesterday morning, a large quantity of indica rice from Wuhu is about to arrive in Shanghai and will be available for sale within a few days. Regarding the joint purchase of Saigon foreign rice by various groups in this city, the Shanghai Accountants Association had previously notified all rice purchasers to postpone the purchase because the Saigon authorities prohibited the export of rice. According to inquiries, the source of domestic rice has increased, and rice prices are trending downward. The groups will temporarily suspend the purchase of foreign rice.

斛司 Asks to Open Bags and Inspect Rice

The total number of 斛司 in the city is more than 1,000. After the war, rice transported to Shanghai by people was changed from bulk to bagged, resulting in no rice for 斛司 to inspect, and they were unemployed. On December 15 last year, after a meeting of various rice industry groups, it was decided that for those who had passed the 斛司, the rice shops would deduct one cent per stone of 斛力 as relief. Recently, due to the increase in the cost of living, all relief measures are difficult to maintain a livelihood. Therefore, the rice industry travelers are required to deduct one cent of 斛力 from all rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains of foreign machine and Yangtze River origin, and to automatically open bags and inspect rice that is shipped and delivered from October 8. The Bean and Rice Industry Association stated that there was no custom of inspecting and deducting 力斛 from foreign machine goods and Yangtze River goods before the war. This request from 斛司 is difficult to accept, so it was rejected. The attitude of 斛司 is also very firm. Therefore, this matter may cause disputes. In order to prevent accidents, the police authorities of both concessions have decided to increase patrols to protect the shipment of rice from the various foreign docks from today.

### Puppet Police Held Drills in Residential Areas in Western Shanghai Yesterday; Even Trampling on Private Gardens; Philipps Expresses He Will Not Abandon Rights

Since the intrusion of puppet police into the area of roads built beyond the boundary, the situation has deteriorated. However, because the Municipal Council has always dealt with the various acts of overreach of the puppet police with perseverance, no major accidents have occurred. Recently, the Japanese and puppet police, in addition to actively organizing "special task forces" and "self-defense corps," have not been seen to continue to expand, and the mood of residents has been slightly stabilized, and the trend of migration has been slightly reduced. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter went to the area for a week-long inspection. It was learned that at about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a team of puppet police, 75 people, conducted drills near the residence of Baron Peck弗理司, the Swedish ambassador to Columbia Road in western Shanghai, and even invaded people's gardens, causing nearby residents to be frightened. In addition, the deployment of Japanese and puppet forces remains the same as before. As for the police, they are still in the border area, allowing strict inspection of pedestrians and vehicles at various key locations. After being briefly occupied by the Japanese and puppets at 99 Jessfield Road, they only stayed for a few days before withdrawing. The residents of the house have all moved back. At present, the puppet police in western Shanghai are starting to investigate household registrations, and at the same time, the puppet "Finance Bureau" has also started to handle property registration to achieve its attempt to gradually collect taxes and donations.

Blocking Traffic for Study

Yesterday afternoon, a large team of puppet police held a military exercise in the area of roads built beyond the boundary in western Shanghai. The reporter from 大中社 learned the details as follows: At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, more than 70 puppet police and Japanese military police, carrying rifles and machine guns, drove to the area between Columbia Road and Anhua Temple Road, blocking all traffic. Under the command of the Japanese military police, the puppet police began blank-firing exercises, firing hundreds of shots and charging back and forth. The vegetable gardens in the area were arbitrarily trampled on, and the area was a mess. The puppet police even crossed walls and fences and invaded people's gardens. At that time, the residents within a mile around were greatly frightened. The puppet police's study lasted for 30 minutes before they announced the lifting of the ban. However, after 3:00 PM, the puppet police were still stationed on the roads in the area.

Western Homeowners Are Very Angry

The English 大美 Evening News reported that 75 police officers opened machine guns and rifles near the residence of Swedish Ambassador柏克弗烈斯 and next to the Columbia Association this afternoon (the 7th), seemingly practicing combat. They also trampled through gardens in several private residences, causing neighbors to be in a state of anxiety. According to a phone call to "Mayor" 傳筱庵 to inquire, he claimed to know nothing about it. The reporter then obtained confirmation from homeowners in the area. According to these angry homeowners, there is plenty of space for exercises on the other side of Hongqiao Road.

The Rights and Interests of Western Shanghai Cannot Be Abandoned

The Chinese-language Linbao reported that Municipal Council President Philipps told reporters yesterday afternoon (the 6th) that the Municipal Council is not prepared to abandon any of its rights in the area outside the boundary of western Shanghai. The situation regarding police and other municipal matters in the area has been in a stalemate for a month. An impression has arisen in some quarters that the Municipal Council is gradually yielding to the pressure from the "Special Municipal Government," while 傳筱庵's large number of armed police and tax collectors are appearing in the area. In fact, the Municipal Council has spent huge sums in the area to build houses, repair roads, and engage in general municipal improvements. Therefore, it feels that since the Western District has already created all the necessary residential areas, the taxpayers who contributed to this improvement will be fully protected against encroachment, and the rights and interests of the Municipal Council in the area will also be carefully defended.

Police Force Has Indeed Increased

According to reporters, since the current state of emergency occurred, the Public Concession police force operating in the area of roads outside the boundary has almost tripled. Police officers who could be drawn from other districts have been transferred to protect residents west of Haig Road. Assistant Chief Inspector克 has taken all possible police precautions. As a result of these arrangements, before 4:00 PM this afternoon, there were three concession patrols at each intersection in the area, which increased to five from 4:00 PM to midnight. Police patrols have been increased to six people per team under the command of foreigners.

International Merchant Corps Continues to Patrol

In addition, armored vehicles of the International Merchant Corps are often seen patrolling together in pairs on roads outside the boundary. Roads outside the boundary are located within the defense area of the British and Italian armies. There is currently full cooperation between the Public Concession Police Department and the British and Italian garrisons. It is heard that Philipps and 傳筱庵 only held one meeting at Jiangwan nearly three weeks ago, and have not continued to meet. However, it is heard that the Public Concession authorities are quite willing to consider any suggestions put forward by the "Special Municipal Government" to resolve the current difficult situation.

The Puppet Government's Attitude Remains Strong and Stubborn

The English 大美 Evening News reported that Shanghai "Mayor"傅筱庵 told reporters yesterday afternoon (the 6th) that unless it is fully acknowledged that the roads outside the boundary in the Western District are located in the Chinese territory and should be governed by the Shanghai "Special Municipal Government," this problem cannot be compromised. The "Special Municipal Government" police force on the roads outside the boundary will gradually increase. The police problem cannot be delayed too long without being resolved. However, 傳氏 refused to respond to Municipal Council President Philipps' statement that "the Municipal Council's rights on the roads outside the boundary will not be abandoned automatically." 傳氏 also said that since he took office, gambling dens and other criminal places have been greatly reduced, most of which have closed down automatically due to "poor business," but he will do his best to curb them all. As far as gambling dens are concerned, the municipal government has never accepted money from gambling dens and other criminal places as "compensation."

### New Cotton from Beisha Shipped to Shanghai

This year's new cotton has already entered the market, and it is heard that the harvest is still abundant. Recently, it has been continuously shipped to Shanghai from Beisha in large quantities. Yesterday, the Taikoo Wulin Wheel and the Jardine Matheson Tonghe Wheel shipped 5,072 bales. There are also 400 to 500 bales on the Luan and Lisha wheels. Most of this cotton is sold to Japanese yarn mills.

### Export Settlement of Local Products: Aimed at Centralizing Foreign Exchange; Shanghai and Ningbo Chambers of Commerce Have Telegraphed to Request Remedies; Customs Prevents Private Export Through Misuse of Postal Parcels

After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Measures for the Settlement of Exported Goods and Receipt of Foreign Exchange Rate Differences," it stipulated that, except for tung oil, tea leaves, bristles, and minerals – the four categories related to barter trade, debt repayment, and raw material reserves – all other exported goods must be sold to the government for foreign exchange at the legal rate. At the same time, the government would provide the difference between the legal rate and the bank's listed price. Customs offices across the country have now been ordered to implement this. Therefore, local products transported to Shanghai from provinces such as Zhejiang and Fujian must be settled at the legal rate. Goods for domestic sale, regardless of type, must also be settled. Various industries have repeatedly requested the chambers of commerce to forward their requests to the government for remedies.

Two Chambers of Commerce Telegraph, Requesting Remedies

Now, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, recognizing that these measures hinder commercial sales and increase hardship for the people, have telegraphed both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, explaining the reasons for this settlement and requesting remedies to alleviate the difficulties faced by merchants in Jiangsu. A reporter from the "New Sound Society" learned yesterday from relevant sources that the government's current regulation on the settlement of local products aims to centralize foreign exchange, maintain the legal currency, stabilize finance, promote exports, and increase domestic production.

Foreign Exchange Difference Settlement Methods

As for the central bank's legal price, the British pound is set at one shilling and two and a half pence. The listed price of the British pound at the Bank of Communications is seven pence. The so-called "receiving the foreign exchange difference" is the difference between seven pence and one shilling and two and a half pence. The settling bank may charge the settling party the usual handling fee, but it is stipulated that it must not exceed three percent.

Preventing Export Through Misuse of Postal Parcels

The National Government's Ministry of Finance issued a circular to customs offices across the country stating that, in order to prevent export by falsely using postal parcels and evading foreign exchange, the fifth article of the "Implementation Measures for the Sale and Settlement of Foreign Exchange for Postal Parcels" previously drafted by this port was followed as directed by telegram Yu Zi No. 5989. However, upon investigation, the original fourth article stipulates that goods subject to foreign exchange settlement mailed abroad weighing less than three kilograms are treated as samples and are exempt from applying for foreign exchange settlement documents. Currently, because the scope of settlement has expanded, many lightweight but valuable items among foreign exchange goods may inevitably use this to evade foreign exchange. The original text of this article should be supplemented and explained to eliminate abuses.

Supplementary Explanation to Eliminate Abuses

That is, "Goods subject to foreign exchange settlement mailed abroad weighing less than three kilograms are treated as samples and are exempt from applying for foreign exchange settlement documents, but they must be forwarded through Hong Kong's Fuhua Company. The forwarding costs will be borne by the Trade Commission. Parcels weighing less than three kilograms but valued at more than fifty yuan must still be settled according to the regulations." In addition to ordering the Trade Commission to be informed and consulting the Ministry of Communications for reference and to instruct post offices across the country to strictly comply, and instructing all customs offices to comply, a joint telegram is sent for information.

### Japan Obstructs American Broadcasting; Japan Expresses Its Attitude; Details of Japan-US Radio Wave Regulations Unknown; If Joining an Agreement, Should Abide by Regulations

The Continental Daily reports that when Japanese representatives received journalists yesterday (the 6th), some inquired about the matter of a Japanese radio station with the call sign KZI allegedly interfering with shortwave broadcasts from the RCA radio station on the US West Coast. A spokesperson for the Japanese embassy responded that if Japan is a signatory to the 1932 Madrid International Telecommunications Convention which assigns radio wavelengths, it would naturally abide by the regulations of that convention. One journalist stated that the RCA radio station was assigned a frequency of 9530 kHz in 1928. The spokesperson stated that he was unaware that the KZI radio station had been granted permission to use the 9535 kHz frequency for broadcasting prior to 1928 and that the matter would need to be investigated. One journalist pointed out that the 1932 convention stipulates that the frequency assigned to a radio station should not be interfered with by other radio stations, and the broadcasting frequency of each radio station should not be within 10 kHz of another radio station's frequency. The embassy spokesperson replied that he knew nothing about the radio waves assigned to Japan and the US and therefore could not discuss the matter. However, if Japan is a signatory to the agreement, it would naturally abide by its regulations. An Associated Press dispatch from this port on the 7th stated that broadcasts from the American radio station on the West Coast to this city, which had previously been impossible to receive due to interference from Japan's KZI, showed significant improvement last night. Listeners in this city were able to receive the radio station's rebroadcast of Hitler's speech to the German Reichstag last night. The interference from the Japanese radio station began on October 1st when Japan established a radio station with a frequency five degrees different from that of the American radio station to broadcast to the Dutch East Indies. International radio regulations stipulate that the choice of radio station frequencies must not interfere with other radio stations, and should generally differ by ten degrees. Radio experts in this city believe that the West Coast radio station likely increased its power last night.

### Disaster Relief Donations to Continue for Another Year; Chamber of Commerce Has Been Ordered to Notify All Industries

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to various trade associations and major companies regarding the continuation of disaster relief donations from the business community for another year, stating: "Over the past year, the business community has enthusiastically contributed to disaster relief, exhausting their efforts and resources, which is evident to all, both Chinese and foreign. However, due to the unsettled situation, refugees displaced in Shanghai and sheltered in various reception centers are still difficult to return to their hometowns. It is absolutely unacceptable to stop aid halfway. In addition, rising prices have increased the cost of supplies by more than half compared to before. The relief responsibilities borne by various organizations have not only not lessened at this time but have actually increased. In these times of widespread hardship and distress, appealing to the fundamental principle of human mutual assistance, we must persevere through hardship and strive to fulfill our responsibilities, aiming to thoroughly save people and complete the work. All methods of donating one percent of industry salaries and a percentage of business profits for disaster relief will follow the original plan from last year, with a term of one year. From the date of expiration, the extension of one year should be implemented, so that relief funds can continue to be maintained without interruption. If there is hope for an early end to the refugee relief effort at that time, this donation can also be terminated early. We certainly do not want to burden the business community for a long time, which would violate our original intention. This is declared in advance."

### Citizens Should Use New Fractional Currency Notes Immediately; Do Not Collect Them Out of Curiosity and Hinder Circulation; Rumors of Tobacco Exchange Industry's Monopoly; Industry Denies

Since the Central Bank issued fractional currency notes, it was originally expected that the rampant situation of substitute vouchers on the market and the difficulties of merchants giving change would be resolved. However, it has been ten days since the Central Bank issued them, and substitute vouchers are still prevalent, while the newly issued fractional currency notes are rarely used. The reason for this is that some shops, not understanding the situation, are hoarding them, and citizens, finding them novel, are competing to collect them, which is causing this situation. The First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that although citizens are collecting these fractional notes out of curiosity, the result is hindering the circulation of the fractional notes, making it possible for various miscellaneous vouchers to continue to circulate. Therefore, they issued a notice yesterday to the branch federations urging citizens not to collect the fractional notes, to use them immediately upon receipt, and to circulate them in the market, so that the problem of the lack of small change in Shanghai can be resolved as soon as possible. The Federation also strictly ordered the member businesses of each branch federation that had previously issued substitute vouchers as a temporary measure to immediately recall them within a limited time, and to invalidate them after the deadline. All sectors of the city are paying close attention to the fact that streetcar substitute vouchers have not yet been fully recovered, fearing that if they circulate for too long, they will become tattered and blurred, causing considerable losses to the people, which will be a major obstacle to the widespread use of fractional currency notes. It is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions and the Central Bank will pay attention to this. As for the rumor that the Central Bank has severely criticized the tobacco exchange industry for monopolizing the fractional notes, the association has denied this, saying that the association distributes the notes to its members and there is no monopoly to speak of.

### Debts and Obligations Involving Counterfeit Money Deemed Invalid; Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Maintain Disaster Relief Efforts

The Ministry of Finance telegraphed all provincial and municipal governments and chambers of commerce stating that the puppet "Joint Reserve Bank" and "Huaxing Bank" established by the Japanese puppets in Tianjin and Shanghai are issuing counterfeit money. All our citizens, as well as the financial industry and other industries, should refuse to use it. This Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed instructions to comply, and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to consult the Judicial Yuan to instruct all levels of courts that any debts or obligations based on counterfeit money should be legally invalid. This is on record. Now, we have received Executive Yuan Directive Lü Zi No. 9534 of August 22, 1939, which states, "Noted. The case has been consulted with the Judicial Yuan, which responded with Zi Zi No. 16 of August 5, 1939, and has instructed the Ministry of Justice to comply and instructed the Supreme Court to take note." We are issuing this order to comply, and to forward it to all sectors, and to pay serious attention to it.

### Workers Refuse Gatekeeper's Inspection Upon Leaving Work and Assault Two Police Officers; Assaulting Workers Sentenced to Detention

The printing department of the German company Ru Lin Foreign Firm at No. 531 Pei Kai Er Road in Pudong has a customary practice of having gatekeepers and Indian police officers inspect workers upon leaving work to prevent theft of items. However, at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, during dismissal, gatekeeper and Indian police officer Lai La Xing and Chinese police officer Xiao Qunlong were performing their routine duties when suddenly one hundred and several dozen workers in the department resisted.

Refusing Inspection

They claimed that if inspection was required, then senior staff such as managers and executives should also be searched to ensure equality. At the same time, they used violence to assault the two police officers, causing significant injuries to the Indian police officer and tearing the Chinese police officer's uniform. After the Yulin Road Police Station received a report, they immediately ordered Chinese detective Liu Chushun and detective Wang Dongchen to

Rush to Arrest

Wang Shenggen, Wu Caigen, Zhao Guifu, Wang Songhe, Ding Yongzhang, Hang Baidi, Liu Xiaoyang, Hu Akang, Zhang Shunde, Wu Longgen, Pan Yongan, He Zhidao, and Li Zhengming – thirteen people – were arrested. Yesterday, they were brought to the First Special Court. Police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that, upon investigation, all the defendants in this case were members of the "Alliance" of the Pudong Dongchang Road, under the direction of a certain party. The "president" is Kong Qingxiang, and the "vice president" is the defendant Wang Shenggen in this case.

This Action

Was a clearly organized action and an intentional act of striking. The police station has already taken measures to stop it. Therefore, he requested that all defendants in this case be punished for assault. Under questioning by Judge Dai Rongduo, Wang Shenggen and the other twelve people were sentenced to fifteen days of detention each as a warning.

### Xinhua Printing House Ransacked by Thugs; Result: Two Lead Printing Plates Carried Away

The China News Agency reports that the Xinhua Printing House at No. 169 Avenue Edward VII, which specializes in printing various small newspapers, a total of six or seven, suddenly had a person resembling a certain type of person and four or five Chinese men and one woman arrive in a private car at the door of the printing house during busy working hours on the evening of the day before yesterday. They rushed in, and one or two of them seemed to be carrying weapons. They were menacing and beat anyone they saw. The workers, seeing the situation was bad, scattered and fled. The people claimed to be looking for a certain editor of a certain small newspaper. After being told that he was not there and repeated explanations, they carried two lead printing plates of a certain small newspaper that had already been typeset and drove away. Afterwards, after someone reported it to the police station, the police arrived at the scene, but they had already disappeared.

### Accomplice in Murder of Father An Arrested; Held for Joint Trial

The case of Father An being murdered in Xujiahui at the end of last month, in which the perpetrator Ju Bolv fled from Pudong and surrendered to the French Concession police station, was previously reported. The police station had escorted him to the Second Special Court and requested an extension of detention for investigation. It is now known that the French Concession police station arrested another accomplice in the case the day before yesterday, a local named Wang Guirong, who is over thirty years old. Because further investigation is still required, the French police station escorted Wang Guirong to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday morning to request detention. Judge Miao Qingbang sat in court and questioned him, ordering the defendant Wang Guirong to be detained and rescheduling the joint trial with Ju Bolv for October 15.

### Embezzlement of Compensation: Defendant Acquitted

The case of rice merchant Zhu Qiu Xiong being sued by rice merchant Yuan Zhonghou of Luxu in the First Criminal Court for embezzling military insurance compensation from the Central Trust Bureau was heard again yesterday morning by Judge Xiao Peishen in the First Criminal Court. He first questioned the defendant about the certification documents from the Yizhong Notary Office. He had not yet obtained them because the rice being transported at that time was lost en route. The Central Trust Bureau paid compensation as usual. Because the plaintiff claimed it was cash, while the defendant claimed the payment was made by check transferred through the Yizhong Notary Office, further investigation was required. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer, Li Wu, presented a reply from the Yizhong Notary Office in court, proving that the payment was indeed made by check. The defendant then stated that the rice sold by the plaintiff was indeed insured by him with the Central Trust Bureau for over 12,000 yuan. After the rice was damaged, he repeatedly negotiated and finally obtained the compensation. Later, the plaintiff's clerk, Ye, inquired with him, and he also said that the money had been compensated, but the plaintiff needed to find a guarantor to receive it. Because the plaintiff did not have a guarantor, it was not delivered. The money is currently stored in the Meixin Card Company. He then presented the passbook to the court to prove that he had not embezzled anything. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant intended to embezzle the compensation, and he repeatedly negotiated but the defendant always denied it. There is a recording of a telephone conversation between the plaintiff and defendant as evidence. After speaking, he played the recording in court. However, because the language was vague and the pronunciation was unclear, Judge Xiao ruled that the case was clear and began the debate. As a result, the defendant Zhu Qiu Xiong was acquitted in court.

### Chinese Medical Community Holds Memorial Service for Xu Banlong

Mr. Xu Banlong, a poet and medical expert from Wujiang, passed away on September 1. Those who knew him mourned his passing. Now, a memorial service is being organized by the Shanghai National Medicine Association, the National Medicine Society, the Chinese Medical College, the New China Medical College, the Chinese Medical College, the Chinese Medical College, the Chinese Medical College, the Qiqiu Society of the Medical Community, and the Wujiang Fellow Association and others. The preparations are complete, and it is scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 8th of this month at the Chinese Medical College at No. 177 Lane on Chongqing Road.

### Pocketbook Snatching on the Road; Arrest Made

Yesterday (the 7th) at around 10:00 AM, a young woman wearing a serge cheongsam was walking to the intersection of Guangdong Road and Fujian Road when she was suddenly approached by a robber wearing a black short shirt who snatched a patterned leather wallet from her hand and fled into Wangdaji Lane to the east. The young woman shouted for help, and someone intercepted the robber. Police arrived and found that the wallet contained 49 yuan in cash untouched. They took the robber and the wallet to the police station for questioning.

### National Government Issues Order on Thrift; Prevents Interference with Finance; Saving Material Resources and Financial Resources to Contribute to the Country; Striving to Prevent Interference with Financial Policy

After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the outline of measures to consolidate finance, wartime financial institutions are becoming more sound. The four banks – Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture – have established a joint office to complete the national financial network with all their strength. They are also encouraging savings, urging the opening of national construction savings, absorbing social idle funds, investing in productive industries, improving overseas remittance methods, spreading overseas remittance financial networks, replenishing foreign exchange, and purchasing materials in war zones to prevent them from being used by the Japanese. They are strengthening the collection of gold and silver and striving to develop mining to increase reserves. Internally, they are seeking to enrich and activate, and externally, they are seeking to resist aggression. However, it requires effort from below to support the financial policy, follow government laws and regulations, and then it can achieve results. Therefore, it has issued a circular to all provincial and municipal governments, instructing their subordinates to ensure that the people of the country save material resources and financial resources, and contribute their strength to the country for the sake of resistance and national construction. Anyone who interferes with the implementation of the government's financial policy should be prevented by officials and the public, and efforts should be made to cherish the people's strength, increase production, develop the economy, and develop transportation to achieve the government's goal of benefiting the country and the people. At the same time, they should publicize as much as possible, urge efforts, and the future of resistance and national construction is heavily dependent on it.

The Police Department

transferred the three people to the Japanese authorities this morning (the 7th) and accused them of armed robbery to the Japanese consulate police department. It is reported that the Western District Japanese military police believe that this case is not important as far as the military police team is concerned, so the authorities of the Tong Wen Academy and the Japanese consulate police department will jointly handle the matter.

### Chinese Medicine Practitioner Qin Bowen Sued for Rent Arrears

Verdict: Should Repay All Arrears

Qin Bowen, a well-known local Chinese medicine conditioning expert, had his clinic at No. 20 Zhenping Lane, Avenue Cardinal Foch, French Concession. In June of this year, Qin leased a house located at No. 3 An Village, the corner of Avenue Joffre, Rue Pere Huc, and Rue Auguste Boppe from Zhengda Company to establish a Western District branch of his Chinese medical sanatorium. The lease was long-term. In addition to paying a deposit, he still owed 4,000 yuan in national currency. Qin voluntarily used the lease rights to the house as collateral and signed another contract, limiting the payment to be made before August 1. However, after signing the contract, he has only paid 200 yuan in legal currency and a remittance of 300 yuan. After deducting the discount, the creditor actually received 261.5 yuan. He has not paid a penny of the remaining 3,538.5 yuan after the deadline. Therefore, the legal representative of Zhengda Company, Tong Tiyan, commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Qin to pay the rent, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay the arrears in one lump sum and to grant provisional execution. The case has been tried by Judge Yu Changzi, and the verdict was announced yesterday. The main text reads: "The defendant should repay the plaintiff 3,538.5 yuan in national currency, and from August 2 to the end of the execution, should repay late interest at an annual rate of 5%. The plaintiff's other claims are dismissed. The litigation costs, except for the portion of provisional execution, shall be borne by the defendant."

Children's Weekly

### On National Day

— Ying Dai

This newspaper resumed publication during the Double Festival last year, but in the blink of an eye, it's another National Day anniversary. Therefore, this year's National Day is the anniversary week of this newspaper's resumption of publication, and also the anniversary week of the Children's Weekly's resumption of publication. We celebrate Double Ten without holding a ceremony, both for this newspaper and for the Children's Weekly.

Every modern country has a National Day. Speaking of the National Day anniversaries of various countries around the world, February 16th is Lithuania's National Day, February 24th is Estonia's National Day, March 25th is Greece's National Day, April 15th is Spain's Republic Independence Day, May 17th is Norway's National Day, May 20th is Cuba's National Day, June 16th is Sweden's current King's birthday, July 1st is Canada's Dominion Day, July 4th is the United States' Independence Day, July 9th is Argentina's National Day, July 14th is France's Republic Day, July 28th is Peru's Independence Day, August 1st is Switzerland's Federal Government Founding Day, August 6th is Bolivia's Independence Day, August 11th is Germany's Constitution Implementation Day, August 20th is Hungary's National Day, August 25th is Uruguay's National Day, August 31st is the Netherlands' current Queen's birthday, September 16th is Mexico's Independence Day, September 18th is Chile's Independence Day, September 26th is Denmark's current King's birthday, October 5th is Portugal's National Day, October 28th is the Czech Republic's National Day, October 29th is Turkey's Republic Day, November 7th is the Soviet Union's Revolution Anniversary, November 9th is Poland's National Day, November 11th is Italy's current King's birthday, November 12th is Austria's National Day, and December 6th is Finland's Independence Day.

As mentioned above, countries around the world usually celebrate the founding of the nation, the establishment of a republic, or the day of independence, as well as the birthday of the monarch, as their National Day. On this day, the whole country celebrates and it is very lively. China's reason for setting Double Ten as National Day is to commemorate the success of the Xinhai Revolution. In the past, we also made grand celebrations on National Day. However, since "September 18th," the country has been in deep trouble, and ever since the outbreak of the war, for six or seven years until now, no ceremony is held on National Day. Having a country but not being able to celebrate makes everyone feel depressed. However, we can look forward to the day of final victory, when we will celebrate the first Double Ten Festival after China's revival with great enthusiasm!

### Double Ten's New Meaning Encourages Children

— Chi Qiang

This year is the 28th Double Ten Festival. Connecting them together, they look too much like a ladder. This should symbolize a ladder for us to climb onto the road to national construction.

Double Ten! Double Ten! One ten plus another ten.

Children! For the Double Ten National Day, you should use the "Double Ten" around you to create!

Children, think about it! Where exactly is the Double Ten around you? Maybe you're going to reach out to me instead. Don't ask me, use your hands to create, use your ten fingers to grasp firmly; your feet close to the motherland's mountains and rivers, ten toes supporting the foundation of the Chinese territory, this is originally the business of the "Guo Zi"—the little masters.

Let the dregs float up, let the filth flow, you still have to use "Double Ten" to destroy the old and rotten, I heard that clarification is not far away.

This time, I have seriously thought that the celebration of this Double Ten Festival should be entrusted to you to handle.

Your hands are clean enough, your feet are the most stable; celebrate Double Ten, nurture Double Ten celebrations, send the celebrated ones away and welcome them back, "constantly increasing"! "Constantly striving"! Only your "Double Ten" (hands and feet) can seamlessly connect with Double Ten and become one!

Children! Come, come, come, let us celebrate the Double Ten Festival today in advance, starting from the eleventh, you must create next year's Double Ten celebration! I offer this new meaning to encourage you!

### Short Story

The teacher asked on the platform: "Who can come up and write three new words?" Mingde said: "I can," the teacher said "jump," he wrote the word "jump"; the teacher said "kick," he wrote the word "kick." The teacher shook his head and said: "Wrong"! Mingde thought he heard wrong, so he didn't write. The teacher called other students to write, but they all wrote incorrectly. At this time, Yimin said: "I can write", the teacher said "jump" he wrote "jump"; the teacher said "follow" he wrote "kick"; the teacher shook his head and said: "Wrong"! So he wrote the word "wrong," and the teacher said: "You are right" (Ci Kai)

### The Great Hunt

— Bai Zheng

—Ming Er's Refugee Diary - Thirty-Seven—

November passed quickly again. Counting from the end of October when Ming Er arrived at that village, he had already spent a month living in a foreign land. The thin clothes Ming Er wore had also changed into thick padded clothes, which clearly indicated that it was late autumn and early winter.

Hunting was prevalent throughout the village at that time of year. Several older children in Ming Er's neighborhood went hunting in the mountains and fields almost every day, always bringing back some harvest. This aroused Ming Er's deep admiration—how interesting it is to shoot a gun; how happy it is to hit a wild rabbit with a "ping" sound; how glorious it is to bring back a large string of harvest, which can also show that my eyesight is not bad; and wild rabbit can also serve as a delicious dish for us. This series of fantasies surged in his heart, and finally he told his mother this idea, but was met with a rebuff, because hunting was a dangerous thing in her eyes, and it was not very suitable for Ming Er's health. The old woman cherished her son too much. One day, he asked his mother to agree to let him follow them to gain experience, and somehow he got her consent.

They shouldered earthen guns—very similar to the guns of the patrolmen Ming Er had seen, but smaller. The gun could only fire once each time. After firing a shot, gunpowder and iron pellets had to be reloaded, which was very troublesome, and the procedures were very complicated. When the gun's hammer was pulled, sparks splashed out with a "bang". If the ammunition was not loaded well, and the eyes were aimed at the gun, it would not be fun if sparks splashed into the eyes; so Ming Er didn't even dare to fire, and could only watch them play—then they whistled. Naturally, the dogs near the neighbor's house seemed to know what was happening, wagging their tails and gathering around. They pointed their hands, and the dogs immediately took the lead, chasing along the familiar road while sniffing. The older children who were hunting followed behind, and Ming Er also joined their group.

Their group of four or five people walked past the road where Ming Er cut grass, and then stepped onto an even narrower and winding path, and the surrounding dead grass wrapped around them even more tightly, often rubbing and squeezing against their clothes. Many dogs searched for their target in the weeds using their sharp sense of smell. At this time, they unknowingly left the path and spread out like a skirmish line. The grass grew over their heads, burying them deeply in the middle, serving as a good disguise, but the constant sound of grass and clothes rubbing was very detrimental to their mission. Everyone's guns were already loaded with ammunition, waiting for the command to pull the trigger. Sharp light beams shot out from their eyes like searchlights, running and jumping among the grass; and their ears seemed to have enlarged their auricles, gathering the sound of the dogs; their feet of course also followed the dogs' tracks, speeding up and adopting an encirclement offensive, shrinking the broad battlefield into a narrow range, preparing to concentrate on one point for a fierce attack, and intensified the encirclement. Those sensitive dogs were doing their reconnaissance work everywhere, sometimes sniffing at one point incessantly, which was the trace of the enemy—their target—so they desperately rushed over. Those creatures in the mountains and fields also had sentry lines laid out every five steps and posts every ten steps. At that time, an urgent alarm—the rustling of grass—meant that they were embracing non-resistance and fleeing in all directions. The scouting dog vanguard barked loudly, followed by a burst of gunfire. Clumsy life was shot and sacrificed, becoming food for the dogs. Although they were snatched away, a head had already become a delicious meal for the dogs, bloody and very cruel! This scene of the tragedy of the survival of the fittest etched very deep impressions in Ming Er's mind—hunting is ultimately an act of aggression based on the "strong bullying the weak"! We should resist the aggression of the strong for the innocent and weak!

### Historical Story Comic Strips

— Shou Ou

Regarding extracurricular reading materials for children, it is indeed a very serious issue, especially in Shanghai, where "comic strip" filled with mythological elements flood the streets, which requires more attention.

The so-called "comic strips" are mostly rented from small book stalls placed at the entrances of alleys. Both the illustrations and texts are extremely crude, the printing is also very bad, and the distortion and fabrication of meanings are self-evident; therefore, for children, there are truly a hundred disadvantages and no advantages. However, children who already know how to read have an unrestrainable desire just like adults, which is the hope to read some interesting books in addition to textbooks; therefore, it is not possible to force them not to rent these "comic strips." The only way is to divert their attention with other publications.

The person in charge of Chunjiang Bookstore started to compile and draw a set of "Historical Story Comic Strips" with this motivation, divided into ten volumes: (1) Yue Fei, (2) Fei Gongren, (3) Gou Jian, (4) Jing Ke, (5) Nie Zheng, (6) Hua Mulan, (7) Wen Tianxiang, (8) Shi Kefa, (9) Qin Liangyu, (10) Qi Jiguang. Just by looking at this list, we can know how valuable the meaning contained in these comic strips is. Now the first volume, Yue Fei, has been published, edited by the primary school education expert Qian Changling, and illustrated by the painter Hu Youfo. The text is so concise and clear, and the illustrations are so vivid and lively. At this time and in this place, it can really be regarded as the most valuable reading material for children.

### The Blue Dwarf (3)

— Ai Li

A Li thought for a while and then opened his mouth and said, "There's more, didn't we also find the cart pulled by the ox very strange at first? Now that we see strange things, we don't think they are strange anymore, because we are used to seeing them. Ah Li, isn't that so? Hey, Ah Li, come quickly and look, a woman is coming from the street over there, carrying a basket on her back, it's as big as a house, have you ever seen it?" Ah Li was very happy that he seemed to have forgotten the dwarf problem, so she accompanied him to look at the woman carrying the large blue basket.

Ah Li and Ah Li's uncle liked to travel the most, often going to those remote places, unlike other summer vacation travelers who always chose luxurious and lively places. This time, they were traveling in a small village in Germany, and had visited several porcelain factories and glass factories in the vicinity, and saw many novel things. This morning, they had gone to one of the largest porcelain factories and returned very happily, their minds filled with beautiful impressions such as the blue dwarf.

They were now in the best hall in the guest house, which their uncle had booked in advance, intending to stay there for a few days. Their aunt was very tired and was resting on a sofa. The two sisters and brothers sat on the wide windowsill, watching everything passing by on the street outside, which aroused their endless interest.

Hearing them talking incessantly, the aunt suddenly raised her eyes and asked, "What are you two always talking about over there? I seemed to have fallen asleep for a while, but I still heard your voices, like little birds chirping and calling non-stop." Ah Li asked nervously, "Aunt, have we disturbed you?" The aunt quickly said, "No, not at all, but you should come over and tell me what you were just talking about."

Hearing this, A Li immediately thought of the blue dwarf again, and said very seriously, "Aunt, maybe you can explain it more clearly than Ah Li. What I want to ask you is, is there really a country of dwarfs in the world? Are they a kind of fairy? Aunt, please explain it to me clearly." The aunt said very surprised, "A Li, are you talking about dwarfs? A country of dwarfs? What is going on?" Ah Li quickly told the aunt about the blue dwarf she had just mentioned; the aunt listened with great interest.

After Ah Li finished speaking, the aunt said to A Li, "We have seen too many strange things on this trip; we must get used to the unusual and not be overly alarmed. A Li, if you see a dwarf, treat them like ordinary people, call them "Sir," and give them a deep bow, and they will also be very kind and polite to you. Don't think of them as monsters or something like that, and make a joke."

As the aunt was saying this, the door of the living room opened, and their uncle had walked in. He was also a very kind and interesting person. As soon as A Li saw him, he forgot all about the blue dwarf problem and what his aunt had said. He immediately rushed to his uncle's side and asked many questions in a haphazard manner. Finally, he asked what kind of car he was planning to take when he continued traveling, whether it was a truck, and whether he could sit with the driver? (To be continued) Shen Bao Children's Weekly

### Establishing Children's Drama

— Cai Jin

In the past two years—the two years since Shanghai fell—we cannot deny that drama has been very prosperous during this period. Although the harvest may not be entirely satisfactory, it is true that the establishment of large and small drama troupes has at least caused a "boom." Although we cannot currently estimate the success in winning over audiences, there is no doubt that we have neglected the future masters—children. This responsibility should be shouldered not only by every drama worker but also by every person who loves children and culture. Therefore, today, it is necessary to propose the "need for children's drama" and we should make the greatest efforts to establish children's drama and open up a new field.

"Children's drama" is not a flat avenue, especially in the current situation. Dark forces are doing their best to oppress all cultural departments, but we cannot fail to explore and promote the road simply because it is too difficult and arduous; on the contrary, we should meet difficulties with perseverance. Under the condition that our purpose is not harmed, we should use techniques as much as possible to establish children's drama. This method is different from surrender, but rather a flexible combat method.

Doing a job is never something that one or two people or groups can accomplish. Therefore, if we want to "establish children's drama," we need cooperation and efforts from many parties. First, we need to ask colleagues in the drama industry to focus part of their attention on children's drama; second, we require writers of scripts to pay attention to the purpose of educating children, and they must try their best to display children's innocence, and must not restrict or educate children with hypocrisy and forcefulness; because child stars in Chinese movies often have this tendency, which should be especially pointed out. Also, the most important thing in creating scripts is to consider the level of acceptance of children, at least they must be able to understand and endure it, because their immature minds and small hearts do not understand much about society; third, we must do our best to discover and cultivate child actors, because we want to establish children's drama, and it should become children's own drama, and not someone else's. In other words, it is necessary to be autonomous.

This time, the Chinese Drama Research Association is performing children's drama at the Xindu Theater, which is very good news. Although some difficulties are inevitable due to time constraints, scripts and actors, I believe that diligent work will yield good results. At the same time, I hope that everyone will advocate and support children's drama, so that the ideal children's drama can be established as soon as possible.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Yun

Shanghai Should Establish a Theater for Kunqu, Qinqiang, and Peking Opera Performances

In my personal opinion, Shanghai should establish a medium-sized theater. The capital doesn't need to be too much, and the ticket prices shouldn't be too high. Kunqu, Qinqiang, and Peking Opera are combined into one troupe, and their main plays are performed in rotation every day. The plays are also arranged interchangeably, and the ticket price is at most five jiao. The show starts with excellent plays, and the time is about three to four hours. The "anmu" (program listing) is abolished, and tea is provided freely. All the roles that are not trendy but have a solid foundation can be recruited into the troupe. As for Bai Yunsheng, Hou Yongkui, Ma Xianglin, Tao Xianting, and their teams, etc., they only need to be added to the troupe and given some roles. It is much better than when they have problems even drinking porridge. They will definitely be willing to do it. It seems that outstanding talents for Qinqiang roles can still be selected from Tianjin or the Tianqiao area of ​​Beijing. Fortunately, there are not many martial arts plays in Bangzi Opera recently. If you only want to listen to singing plays, not only does the troupe not need many people, but the stage only uses three people who pull the "huhu" (two-stringed fiddle), beat the drums, and knock the clapper.

If this theater is realized, it is expected that the business will be very prosperous. On the audience side, they can listen to various types of dramas at extremely low prices, which will refresh their ears and eyes. At the same time, the actors of Kunqu, Qinqiang, and Peking Opera can also learn from each other, which will not only preserve drama but also bring hope for the balanced development of various local dramas in China. Those with ambition can try it. — (116)

### Wang Xiawen and Tang Ruoqing Arrive in Shanghai Together

— Hua

Proving That Previous Rumors Were Untrue, They Will Guest Star in Plays at a Certain Theater

The "China Traveling Theater" (Zhong Lü) 's long-term performances at the Carlton Theater have made indelible contributions to the revival of spoken drama in Shanghai. It has not only won over the audience of civilized plays but has also influenced the acting skills of civilized play practitioners. For example, Jiang Ming's "Lu Gui style" and Tang Ruoqing's dialogue cadence have now become the acting textbook for general clowns and female roles.

After the War of Resistance, they left Shanghai, and many unfortunate news came: such as the friction between Guang Huaiqiu and Jiang Ming, and the separation of Guang Ruoyu and Wang Xiawen. Now, the former news has been confirmed, but the two people who separated still each stick to their posts and work hard for the drama movement—Tang Huaiqiu is about to return to Shanghai, and Jiang Ming has joined the Dadi Film Company in Hong Kong. As for the latter, recent Shanghai newspapers have also seen records of this young couple going their separate ways; however, the day before yesterday, Tang Ruoqing and Wang Xiawen still returned to Shanghai very affectionately, which is indeed good news worth reporting to the audience who care about them.

They came back to Shanghai this time to accompany the "Zhong Lü" mother Wu Jing, because Wu Jing was not used to life in Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai to live for a long time. Tang Ruoqing and Wang Xiawen also took this opportunity to return and have a reunion with friends in Shanghai. The author met the couple somewhere yesterday, and when I told them the rumors, they smiled without answering. In fact, this return is the best answer to prove the rumors.

Their stay in Shanghai this time is very short, but they themselves cannot determine when they will leave. And some friends have already negotiated with Tang Ruoqing, inviting her to guest star in a play at a certain theater during this short period. Tang Ruoqing said that as long as time permits, she will definitely appear on stage. It is estimated that the chance of success is over 80 percent. Once the opportunity is ripe, the author will report their whereabouts at any time.
