### British Implementation of Naval Escorts to Protect Merchant Ships; Intensified Blockade to Ensure Maritime Superiority; Germany Announces Contraband Includes Food and Clothing, Etc.; Submarine Tactics Will Intensify Thereafter

London - Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today the implementation of a naval escort system to counter German submarines, stating that once the escort system is fully implemented, it will prove to be highly effective in determining the outcome of the war. Currently, the British light naval forces are participating in the struggle, and the main goal of the British Navy, as in the previous war, is to ensure freedom and security at sea. The German side has once again violated all the rules of naval warfare in this war, carrying out cruel actions against passenger merchant ships. Several British merchant ships have been sunk, and the losses are, of course, quite significant. This was expected, as when the war broke out, a large number of British merchant ships were scattered on the sea, sailing according to peacetime conditions. Germany had already deployed submarines and supply ships to strategic locations before the war, so it is no wonder that some British ships were attacked or nearly attacked by submarines before they could reach ports. However, we are now rapidly implementing the escort system, and its effectiveness is increasing daily. When the war first broke out, German ships at sea or in neutral or British and French ports, excluding Baltic ports, had a total tonnage of 1,105,000 tons. These ships have now completely disappeared from the high seas. Some have been seized, and most have taken refuge in neutral ports and cannot leave. Furthermore, the British fleet's control over contraband has greatly restricted the transportation of supplies needed by Germany by neutral ships. (Reuter's, 13th)

London - Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon. In addition to reporting on the joint meetings of the British and French Supreme Defense Council, he also announced that the government intends to establish a Merchant Shipping Department. However, in the current situation, it is still advisable to manage shipping temporarily under the Ministry of Commerce. He also stated that three Polish destroyers have been incorporated into the British fleet and are proving to be very effective. British warships are constantly bombarding enemy submarines, and significant progress has been made in eliminating submarines. Recalling the previous European war, our navy did not escort merchant ships until the summer of 1917. By the time of the armistice, a total of 16,500 merchant ships had been escorted, of which only 102 were sunk by submarines. Now that the government has quickly adopted escort measures, there is no reason to say that their effectiveness is less than it was twenty-two years ago. (Havas, 13th)

Berlin - The German government announced last night that the amended contraband regulations of the 12th of this month would be implemented from today. According to an official statement, Germany previously issued contraband regulations on August 28th, stipulating that unconditionally prohibited goods were limited to goods transported to enemy territory and directly used by the enemy's land, sea, and air forces. Now, the British contraband list is far more extensive than this limit, so the German government has no choice but to amend the regulations as well. Article 1 regarding unconditionally prohibited goods should be amended as follows: 1. Various military equipment and parts and components thereof; 2. Various munitions, bombs, torpedoes, mines, sea mines, landmines, and various bullets, shells, launchers, gunpowder, explosives, detonators, etc.; 3. Various warships, parts, and components thereof; 4. Various military aircraft and parts and aircraft engines; 5. Armored vehicles and armored trains; 6. Chemical warfare materials and various launching and explosive mechanisms; 7. Military uniforms and military equipment; 8. Communication and lighting equipment and parts thereof; 9. Transportation equipment and parts; 10. Various motors and heating materials; 11. Gold and silver coins and promissory notes; 12. Various machinery and materials for manufacturing the items stipulated in item 11. The regulations regarding conditionally prohibited goods will now amend Article 24 of August 28, 1939, as follows: Food, luxury goods, feed, clothing, and their production materials that meet the requirements of Article 24 are all contraband. (Haitong, 14th)

Berlin - Regarding the German amendment to the contraband regulations, the newspapers here have all written articles commenting on it, believing that it is a response to the British "piratical contraband policy." The newspapers emphasized that the scope of the British-announced contraband list proves that Britain has abandoned all international conventions and reverted to piratical methods. Hereafter, the food and clothing issues of the people of Italy, Spain, Yugoslavia, Greece, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries will be directly controlled by Britain. Under these circumstances, Germany has no choice but to amend the contraband regulations, even though it knows that neutral countries will inevitably be affected. However, the matter is a passive one, and there is no alternative. All countries should be able to ascertain who is responsible. (Haitong, 14th)

### Complete Halt of German Shipping; Supply of Adjacent Neutral Countries; Britain Demands Neutrality from South American Countries; France Also Pays Attention to the Status of European Countries

Paris - After the British and French navies implemented a blockade against Germany, the country's shipping has completely stopped. Hereafter, all supplies will have to rely on neighboring neutral countries. Diplomatic pressure has been applied to ensure that neutral countries supply the country with various goods as much as possible. It is reported that the relationship between the Slovak Republic and Hungary has become tense due to this. The Slovak Republic's army has been forced to join the German army in fighting Poland, and Hungary is also deploying troops on the border, refusing to allow German troops to pass through to attack Poland. French diplomatic circles are closely watching this matter and stated that according to international law, neutral countries must not take any measures to assist belligerent countries in increasing their war resources. Therefore, supplying certain contraband goods to belligerent countries is a violation of neutrality. (Havas, 13th)

London - The Information Department has just released a communiqué stating that, "In view of the possibility that the enemy may set up submarine bases on the coasts of Central and South American countries, the British government has instructed its envoys stationed in those countries today to request the governments of the countries in which they are stationed to take all necessary measures to avoid undermining neutrality." (Havas, 13th)

London - The Information Department has just released a communiqué stating that the Dutch ship "Groenlo," carrying a batch of goods to Düsseldorf, Germany, was intercepted by a British warship. Upon investigation, it was confirmed that there were contraband goods on board, and the ship was immediately advised to unload the goods at Downs Port in England. Once the unloading is completed, it will be allowed to proceed. In addition, although several American ships have been inspected by British warships, none have been detained. Among them, the "Black Osprey" was escorted to Weymouth Port by a British warship on the 6th of this month for inspection. However, because the 400-odd items of cargo showed no signs of being transported to Germany, it was immediately allowed to depart. (Havas, 13th)

New York - It is reported that a maritime radio station recently intercepted a radio call from the British ship Vancouver City (4,955 tons), stating that the ship had been hit by a torpedo and the crew were now taking to the lifeboats. The ship's location was somewhere near the English Channel south of Ireland. (Reuter's, 14th)

Copenhagen, Denmark - The Greek ship "Gantigo Hajatella" recently struck a German mine in the southeastern waters of Sweden and sank immediately. (Havas, 13th)

Rome - A British government plan to obstruct the economic and trade relations between Germany and neutral countries has aroused great resentment among Italian political and economic figures. Political figures here pointed out that if Britain implements the plan, Italian commercial and shipping interests will not be subject to its control. Regarding the joint exercises of the British and French navies in Egyptian territorial waters and the concentration of British and French naval fleets near Gibraltar, people here believe that the purpose is to threaten Italy. (Haitong, 14th)

Stockholm, Sweden - After the German government released the contraband list, political figures here commented on it, saying that the intention is to obstruct Sweden's export trade and then monopolize it, forcing it to be transported to Germany. (Havas, 14th)

Stockholm, Sweden - British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday and the French cabinet's reorganization into a wartime cabinet have been commented on by political figures here, who say that each of these countries is determined to fight until victory, regardless of how long it takes. This is another clear proof that the German propaganda machine once said that once its troops defeated Poland, it could proceed with peace talks. This plan has clearly failed, and the German side has now changed its course, trying to persuade neutral countries, telling them that the British-made contraband list is intended to harm the trade of neutral countries and should regard that country as a "common enemy." This has been unanimously opposed by the Swedish newspapers. The Daily News also stated that "This contraband list can only strike Germany, and other countries will not be affected in any way." (Havas, 14th)

### British Foreign Secretary Announces Air Force's Attitude Towards Germany; If Germany Bombs Undefended Areas of Poland, Britain Will Take the Same Measures

London - British Foreign Secretary Halifax declared in the Upper House today that if the German side implements its threat to bomb undefended towns and cities in Poland, the British government will not be bound by the instruction to British forces not to bomb undefended areas of Germany. The British government has this restriction on the condition that the enemy has the same restriction. If the enemy does not abide by this restriction, the British government will be completely free to take what action it deems appropriate. (The listeners cheered greatly.) Lord Strabolgi spoke on behalf of the Labour Party to support the government's attitude, saying that we certainly do not want to degenerate to the same barbaric level as Germany, but we also do not want to tie the hands of our military authorities, even if civilians suffer greatly as a result. Because the enemy has imposed a war in the skies upon us, we can only use free means to return what they have inflicted upon us to them, in order to destroy their economic and military power. At the beginning of his speech, the Foreign Secretary first recounted Britain's reply to President Roosevelt's appeal, saying that Britain's declaration of September 3rd, not to bomb undefended towns and cities, represents the opinion that the American and French governments have carefully considered. This morning, you have probably seen the news that the German government declared its intention to bomb undefended towns and villages in Poland to break the Polish civilians' resistance. Although this statement has not yet been officially confirmed, if it is true, it directly contradicts Hitler's previous statement in the German parliament that he did not want to wage war against women and children. Although belligerent countries have the right to kill the enemy, they ultimately have no reason to indiscriminately bombard civilians from the sea or sky. (Reuter's, 13th)

London - The German government has agreed to abide by the provisions of the 1925 Geneva Gas Protocol, prohibiting the use of toxic and asphyxiating gases and microbes in warfare. This was announced by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in the House of Lords today. It is said that when former British Ambassador to Berlin Sir Henderson collected his exit passport from the German government, he asked whether Germany would abide by the provisions of the Protocol. The German government has now delivered a reply through the Swiss Minister in Berlin, stating that it is determined to abide by the Protocol, as British interests in Germany are now represented by the Swiss Minister. The Foreign Secretary also said that the German government had stated that if Britain and France violated the Protocol, the German government would reserve full freedom of action. (Reuter's, 14th)

### Italy Decides to Resume Shipping to the Far East

Rome - The Italian Postal Shipping Company has decided to reopen merchant shipping routes to Shanghai and cargo shipping routes to India and the Far East. (Reuter's, 14th)

### Editorial

— America's Far East Policy

Yesterday's newspaper carried a Washington telegram from the United Press, stating that President Roosevelt, at a reception for reporters the day before yesterday, elaborated on America's current international policy, with three main points: one concerning the Far East, two concerning Canada, and three concerning the various countries, dependencies, and islands of the Americas. Among them, the second and third points can be regarded as preventive measures to politically isolate Europe from the war, and have their own profound significance. Therefore, since Canada decided, 'all have responded with positive reactions. Regarding the Far East, we deeply regret that our vision and hearing are not comprehensive enough to fully understand the details. However, those who have close interests in the Far East cannot help but be delighted upon hearing the United Press telegram. It is particularly comforting for the people of Shanghai that the news came at a time when the Shanghai concessions have repeatedly suffered adversity.

Judging from the joy and comfort of those who have heard the news, it can be known that America's policy has not yet been clearly understood by the general public. In fact, America places the greatest emphasis on the Americas in its international relations, followed by isolating itself from the Far East, and then from Europe. Regarding the Americas, it invariably expresses its willingness to take the lead in everything. Whether in power or out of power, the consensus is unanimous. If there is anyone who covets the Americas, even by a hair's breadth, America will immediately repel them, responding like an echo. Regarding Europe, it has both likes and dislikes, and is cautiously trying to avoid getting caught in the vortex. The isolationist faction, although relatively isolated, can still stand independently, and there is a reason for this. However, the difference between likes and dislikes, and the degree of isolation, wax and wane depending on the time and circumstances. Therefore, the angle of fluctuation in America's national policy regarding the European situation is the greatest. Regarding the Far East, it uses a fixed national policy as the standard for measuring everything. If it is in line with that national policy, it is supported; if it is not in line, it is abandoned. Britain, in the Tokyo negotiations, almost knelt, almost abandoned, is the most recent example. Therefore, when it comes to the United Press telegram, we do not need to investigate the details. To put it another way, President Roosevelt, no matter how many times he reiterates it, has not added to America's fixed national policy. President Roosevelt, if he remains silent and makes no expression, has not reduced America's fixed national policy. In other words, those who care about the Far East do not need to be comforted only when they hear something, nor do they need to worry only when they hear nothing.

International affairs should not be dominated or manipulated by any one country. Any one country in the international arena invariably has to gradually change or drastically change its international policies in response to changes in the environment. For example, the Soviet Union and Germany changed their policies to adapt to the environment, and those surrounding the Soviet Union and Germany changed their policies in response to the changes in the Soviet Union and Germany. Therefore, to say that a certain country's international policy is fixed and unchanging is probably not an accurate statement. Therefore, there are also strategists in the international arena who are resentful that the national policies of other countries are not in their favor, and who plan to shake them; threatening with coercion, enticing with benefits, deceiving and inciting with propaganda, and running around and scheming with the techniques of diplomats, are all commonplace. Given the complexity and drama of international transformations, is it not also possible for America's national policy to be changed? Given America's tremendous power, is America not a major target of international strategists? How can we be sure that its national policy is necessarily fixed? For example, yesterday America announced that it would convene a special session of Congress on the 21st of this month to discuss amendments to the Neutrality Act. Before yesterday, the convening of a special session was a question, and the timing of the convening was also a question. After the announcement of the convening, the amendment was also a question. All these decisions are related to national policy, and all questions are the subject of efforts by international strategists. Therefore, before the day of their resolution, it cannot be said that America's national policy is fixed and unshakable. This concerns America's European policy, and there is indeed room for shaking, but it is limited to the angle that is allowed. It takes isolation as one line of the angle, and benefiting Britain and France as another line of the angle. From absolute isolation to full support for Britain and France, the angles are different but all are allowed. It can be shaken. If one tries to shake it beyond this angle, to make America aid the warlike and aggressive Germany, then it is unthinkable! As for America's Far East policy, it is even less comparable to its European policy, and there is no considerable angle to allow for fluctuation. It takes maintaining the Nine-Power Treaty as a fixed policy. Under this policy: the note submitted to Japan on December 31 of last year is its positive action; the announcement on July 26 of this year to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is its side action. In addition, there are countless "small actions" in the political, diplomatic, economic, and military spheres, such as the sudden test flight of fourteen naval bombers from the US to Pearl Harbor between the US and Japan. All these, whether positive or side, whether large or small, whether announced or implied, all take its fixed policy as the scope. Taking last year's note as an example, Japan has not yet replied. Among the "strategists," some may initially see the lack of a reply as an opportunity to steal the sky and change the day, and believe that there is room for shaking. But when the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was abolished, they suddenly awakened to the fact that the illusion was not permanent. Why? At this point, they glimpsed the unshakeability of its national policy. Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that America's attitude toward the Far East is still like the note of several months ago. It is clear that the note is still there, and cannot be dismissed. The national policy is there, the great power is there, and there is nothing to discuss with America. What awaits other countries to consider for themselves is, will they quickly change course, and leave room for themselves? Or will they wait until they are at their wits' end, and expose their ugliness?

### German Land and Air Forces Launch Full-Scale Encirclement Operation Against Warsaw; Seizing Fortress, Cutting Off Baltic Railway; Fierce Artillery Battles Between French and German Armies on Western Front

Warsaw - According to observers here, Germany is using all its land and air forces to attack Poland. The fall of Limberg has caused Poland to lose its rich wheat fields and oil mines, and has cut off its transportation with neutral countries. The only remaining transportation is with the Soviet Union, but it is not very reliable. After the recent heavy rains, the ground is muddy, and the fate of the Polish soldiers is turning for the better. The conditions of the suburbs allow the vicinity of Warsaw to be particularly advantageous for the city's defenders. Germany has deployed seventy divisions to attack Poland. Military experts now believe that eleven divisions have been transferred from Poland to the Western front, or are in transit. Assuming Poland has 30 divisions, the German army still has the advantage. As for attacking on the Western front, to win, it is necessary to have at least a three-to-one advantage. The Saarbrücken coal mines are now useless to the Germans, as the French artillery has controlled all roads leading to the area. Observers also said that the British army's transport to France is a great demonstration of its military skill, as the weight of the mechanical equipment carried by the British army is at least thirty times greater than that of any army of the same size in the previous war. (Reuter's, 14th)

London - Judging from the latest war reports from both sides, the fierce battle between the Polish and German armies is underway, fighting for the historically famous Modlin Fortress, twenty miles northwest of Warsaw. The German side broadcast a message last night, stating that the Modlin Fortress, built by Napoleon, has been captured by the German army. At the same time, the Polish message stated that the German army's attack on the fortress has been repulsed, but admitted that the Polish army around Garusin, east of Warsaw, is gradually retreating due to the pressure of the German mechanized forces. There is a rumor that the German army near Annopol has already crossed the Vistula River. This morning, the mayor of Warsaw broadcast that those who should defend Warsaw are very enthusiastic, in order to stop the advance of the enemy and make Warsaw a turning point in the war. (Reuter's, 14th)

Berlin - The German High Command announced today that the German army is launching a general attack on several Polish divisions surrounding Kutno, and the plan to attack Warsaw has been completed. Another German army is advancing on the Modlin Fortress from the northwest. (Haitong, 14th)

London - Fierce fighting continues on the Eastern Front. It is reported that the Polish armies in Posen and Pomerania have joined forces near Kutno. The Polish army is still repelling the enemy near Warsaw. (Reuter's, 14th)

Warsaw - The General Headquarters has just issued a war report stating that, after a fierce counterattack by the Warsaw garrison today, the German army in the suburbs could not withstand it and has begun to retreat. The fighting is fierce in the Maki area northeast of Warsaw and along the railway line from Warsaw to Vilnius. Our cavalry took advantage of the victory to pursue and intercepted ten German tanks. In the area of Kutno and Lowicz, west of Warsaw, our army continued to attack and inflicted heavy damage on the German army. The German army northwest of Warsaw advanced along the Modlin-to-Zgierz railway, but was repulsed by our army. Near the Siedlce-to-Garwolin railway line northeast of Warsaw, the German army launched a fierce attack with motorized units, and our army has been forced to retreat. The German army crossed the Vistula River in the Janopol area and is being blocked by our army. The German army on the southern route attacked Lublin with motorized units and has been repulsed. Fighting is still underway in the area of Gdynia in the northern route. In addition, our army shot down thirty German planes today. (Havas, 13th)

London - According to a Warsaw radio broadcast, the people of Warsaw absolutely do not believe that the Polish capital is about to fall. Life there is gradually returning to normal. The courts continue to hold sessions, the Agricultural Bank is still operating, and the post office is still open. The people of Warsaw work together and protect each other like a large family. The German army is encountering difficulties in carrying out cleaning operations in western Poland, because the courageous Polish army is constantly active, taking advantage of various opportunities to harass them. (Reuter's, 14th)

Bucharest, Romania - According to refugees who fled from Poland to the Romanian border, the German army on the southern route has attacked Strokolczy (73 kilometers south of Lviv). The Polish railway line to Romania has been damaged in several places by German planes. Although the fighting near Lviv is very fierce, the city is still in the hands of the Polish army. (Havas, 14th)

Paris - The General Headquarters has just released War Report No. 20, stating, "Our army has consolidated the positions occupied in the past few days. Our navy is dealing with enemy submarine activity with strict measures. The air force is not very active due to bad weather." (Havas, 13th)

Paris - The General Headquarters has just released War Report No. 21, stating, "The enemy used heavy artillery to fiercely bombard our positions south of Saarbrücken yesterday." (Havas, 14th)

Berlin - It is admitted here that Saarbrücken and the area around Homburg have been invaded by strong French forces. (Reuter's, 14th)

Berlin - Several teams of French elite troops have rushed into German territory. Before the Siegfried Line, between Saarbrücken and Höhnbach, they are now being blocked by German-laid mines and defensive works and have been unable to advance straight in. (Haitong, 14th)

Paris - The Petit Parisien newspaper carries a communication from a military correspondent, stating that no inch of French territory has been trampled on by the German army. On the other hand, the French army has invaded German territory from the Rhine and Moselle fronts. The French army has advanced several kilometers in the area from northeast of Sarreguemines to north of Lauterbourg, and has also made considerable progress further east between the Sarre and Horn rivers. The two armies have clashed there. The French army's recent northward thrust from both banks of the Horn River has caused its front line to advance further. The enemy artillery is retaliating strongly, apparently to cover its infantry's retreat in order to occupy the battlefield works around Saarbrücken. (Reuter's, 14th)

### 格第尼亞港　昨已陷落
Gdynia Port Falls Yesterday

Berlin: According to official sources here, the mayor of Gdynia surrendered the city at 8:30 this morning. The Polish commander defending the city also surrendered. German troops entered the city at 10:15. Fighting continues north of the city. (September 14th, Associated Press)

### 教皇表示　待機恢復和平　如不可能則減輕兵
The Pope Expresses Willingness to Restore Peace, or Failing That, To Alleviate Warfare

Rome: The Pope stated in a speech today that he will seek every opportunity to establish an honorable peace for all parties, to prevent a great calamity befalling Europe. If this proves impossible, he will endeavor to alleviate the suffering of the war, urging all belligerent nations to abide by international treaties, not to harm civilians, to treat prisoners of war well, and to avoid the use of poison gas. (September 14th, Reuters)

Berlin: According to well-informed sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will formally appeal for peace to France within this week. Also, according to German sources, Pope Pius XII may simultaneously undertake mediation efforts, hoping to end the European war. However, the German side believes that the French government seems determined to fight to the end and may not accept Italy's peace appeal. (September 14th, Associated Press)

Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly declared his determination to maintain peace. Last night, he issued a special order specifying that the construction of the 1942 World's Fair site should continue without interruption. Furthermore, the Italian government has ordered that slogans written during the Italian military expedition to Abyssinia be preserved in all locations. Observers are paying close attention to this. (September 14th, Associated Press)

Berlin: Official sources here recently declared that contact between Germany and Italy is being maintained continuously. The report that the Italian ambassador, Attolico, is on the German front lines is untrue. However, the German military authorities have allowed Italian journalists to cover news in the war zone. When German troops crossed the Vistula River near Kulm, Poland, a few days ago, Führer Hitler personally inspected the site, and several Italian journalists were among those following him. (September 13th, Havas)

London: Various reports regarding peace talks in the current war abound. Well-informed sources here are paying close attention but state that the positions of the British and French governments have been clearly stated and are known throughout the world. Briefly, the British and French governments can only negotiate peace with a German government that respects good faith so that a permanent solution can be achieved without endless suspicion. Hitler's usual tactic is to apply brutal acts of aggression, one by one, to non-Germanic countries. Since this strategy has been seen through by everyone, good faith cannot be discussed with Hitler. Accordingly, as soon as a reliable government is established within Germany, the British government will, without hesitation, fulfill its previously reiterated promise and consult with its allies and other friendly nations on how to establish a fair and just peace in Europe and discuss the adjustment of economic relations among countries so that all can cooperate with each other to enjoy the world's resources. (September 13th, Havas)

### 波瀾駐美大使　沉痛演說
Polish Ambassador to the United States Delivers Solemn Speech

Paris: Polish Ambassador Łukasiewicz recently delivered a solemn speech at a banquet at the American Club, stating: "As Germany is currently using brutal means to invade Poland, with countless soldiers, women, children, and civilians dying in heaps, only the facts speak most eloquently. I wish to speak to you based on the facts. Previously, when the dispute between our country and Germany reached its most dangerous point, our government unconditionally accepted the proposal of U.S. President Roosevelt, agreeing to resolve the dispute through direct negotiations or mediation by neutral countries. Who knew that Germany would answer by invading our territory without a declaration of war? President Roosevelt then issued a call, requesting all belligerent nations not to use airplanes to bomb undefended cities, and Germany answered by bombing civilians, injuring and killing women and children. This is the real and cruel fact. Moreover, our country's involvement in this war is purely defensive in nature, to resist imperialist aggression and to protect Poland and to maintain all principles, without which all of humanity will be ruled by force and reduced to a state of slavery. We must resolutely defend our national independence and will not cease until the last German soldier leaves our territory. We have great confidence in the strength of our country and its allies."

### 德軍炸斷　西部鐵路　脫利爾平民撤退
German Troops Bomb Western Railway Line, Trier Civilians Evacuate

Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Capital: German military authorities recently bombed the railway line from Trier in the west to Metz, France. The site was near Schengen in Luxembourg, and fragments of the railway track fell within Schengen but did not injure anyone. (September 13th, Havas)

Brussels: The village of Schengen, at the southernmost tip of Luxembourg, was shaken last night by a terrible explosion. German forces had blown up the railway line crossing the border near the village. Metal fragments fell within Luxembourg but did not injure anyone. This railway is the main route between Trier and Metz. Trier is a famous and ancient town in the German Empire, while Metz is a fortified French town in Alsace-Lorraine, 48 miles away. According to the Volkszeitung, civilians are evacuating Trier. It is strange that there has been no fighting on that front yet. Trier is the seat of a Catholic bishop and has many Roman ruins, unmatched in Northern Europe. In the third and fourth centuries, Roman emperors often resided here. (September 14th, Reuters)

To avoid capture by British warships, the fishing boat loaded seawater, submerging its hull deep below the surface, and sailed at night, hiding among small islands during the day or entering the territorial waters of neutral countries. The success of the ship in evading British warships and navigating difficult waters has attracted attention from all sides. (September 14th, Haitong)

London: The Information Department stated on the 13th that, according to information from Rotterdam, Netherlands, the giant German vessel Bremen had changed to Italian nationality in the Atlantic Ocean and is now sailing to a port in that country. (September 13th, Allied)

### 波蘭飛機迭次　侵入蘇聯領空　多經蘇機驅逐出境　有若干架被迫降落
Polish Aircraft Repeatedly Invade Soviet Airspace, Mostly Driven Out by Soviet Aircraft, Several Forced to Land

Moscow: In the past few days, Polish aircraft have increasingly violated the Soviet border, and Polish aircraft have attempted to penetrate deep into Soviet territory. On September 12th, Polish military aircraft invaded the areas of Shabytivka in Ukraine and Zhydakvichy in Belarus. Soviet military aircraft immediately took off and drove the Polish aircraft out of the country. However, Polish aircraft continued to invade Soviet territory. Yesterday, Polish bombers invaded the border areas of Klyven and Yanpol in Ukraine. At that time, a Polish twin-engine aircraft was surrounded by Soviet aircraft and landed in Soviet territory. The personnel on board, including Commander Yudyuk and pilot Byedzyk, were detained. On the same day, three Polish bombers crossed the Belarusian border at Musso. Soviet fighter aircraft immediately took off and forced the Polish aircraft to land in Soviet territory. The 12 Polish personnel on board were detained. (September 14th, TASS)

Soviet Union Deploys Heavy Troops on Western Border, Intentions Mysterious and Unpredictable

London: According to those familiar with current events, the Soviet Union's mysterious military preparations have been underway for two weeks. Not only are the British and French governments unclear about the Soviet Union's intentions, but the German side is also greatly surprised. According to Moscow sources, the European part of the Soviet Union has fully entered a state of war. The number of armed young men has reached four million, and these troops are not only deployed on the Polish border but along the entire border from Finland to Romania. Heavy troops have been deployed. (September 14th, Reuters)

Moscow: Several passenger trains on the Moscow-Leningrad railway line, including the "Red Arrow Express," were suddenly suspended today. Many passengers carrying luggage spent the night at the station. This was due to frequent military transport, and many troop trains had not returned to their original stations. In recent days, many passenger trains departing from here to the west have also been suspended. In addition, there are 100 cannons at the Guskovo station near the capital, being loaded onto trains for shipment. Their caliber appears to be 155 millimeters. (September 14th, Havas)

### 眞理報論　波蘭現局　軍事失敗主因　在於國內矛盾
Pravda Discusses the Current Situation in Poland, Military Failure Mainly Due to Internal Contradictions

Moscow: Pravda published a commentary today analyzing the inside story and true causes of Poland's military failure. The newspaper stated that although the German-Polish war has only been going on for ten days, it can already be said that Poland has suffered a military defeat. This defeat has caused Poland to lose almost all of its political and economic centers. It is difficult to believe that this failure is purely due to the superiority of German military technology and organization, as well as the failure of Britain and France to provide Poland with effective assistance. In the German-Polish war, we have not been able to find any facts proving that the Polish army has ever given the German army strong resistance or any partial victories. All reports regarding the situation in Poland reveal that the entire Polish regime is gradually collapsing. These reports have proven Poland's weakness and incompetence, and it has been unable to recover from the initial military failure. So, what are the real causes of Poland's bankruptcy? First of all, the real cause of this failure is rooted in the internal weakness and contradictions of Poland. Poland is a country with countless ethnic groups. Purely Polish people only account for 60% of Poland's total population. The remaining 40% are composed of ethnic minorities (mostly Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Jewish). There are no fewer than eight million Ukrainians living in Poland, and there are also three million Belarusians. These two major ethnic minorities total eleven million people. To make all parties understand the importance of the status of Ukrainians and Belarusians in Poland, we should point out that the population of these two major ethnic minorities exceeds the combined population of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. From this point of view, the Polish authorities should immediately strengthen their relationship with these important ethnic minorities, should maintain their rights and interests, should grant them administrative autonomy, and should establish schools and other cultural institutions for them. It is obvious that a government that fails to grant the above-mentioned rights to ethnic minorities cannot strengthen internal unity and national strength. The Polish ruling class has in fact failed to make good use of this point and has not attempted to consolidate the national strength of a country containing many ethnic minorities based on this. On the contrary, Polish ruling figures have done everything they can to make their relationship with ethnic minorities increasingly worse. The policy of the Polish ruling class is to oppress ethnic minorities, especially Ukrainians and Belarusians. In western Ukraine and western Belarus, the people have been brutally exploited by Polish landlords. They have not only been subjected to oppression but have also been deprived of all rights. Although the Polish ruling class boasts of their love of freedom, they have in fact done everything they can to turn western Ukraine and western Belarus into colonies. The rights of the people there have been completely deprived. In this regard, Poland's policy is completely the same as the policy adopted by Imperial Russia. The Polish ruling class has implemented their policies, forcing Ukrainians and Belarusians to become Polonized. Western Ukraine and western Belarus have now become territories for Polish military colonial personnel. Although Poles are in the minority there, they have seized great power. The language has also been Polonized. All officials are Polish and do not recognize any language other than Polish. Non-Polish people are not allowed to hold government positions. The Polish authorities' method of ruling ethnic minorities is as follows: (1) suppression; (2) military tribunals; (3) white terror; (4) inciting divisions within ethnic minorities. The cultural institutions of Ukraine and Belarus have been almost completely destroyed. Polish legislation not only does not grant ethnic minorities autonomy but has also deprived them of the right to study in their own languages. This forced means of Polonizing Ukrainians and Belarusians is not only applied in schools, but Ukrainian and Belarusian literature, newspapers, and art have also suffered the same fate. As a result, Ukrainian and Belarusian culture has fallen into a state of decline. The above are all the true reasons why Poland has failed and cannot achieve internal unity. In fact, if the Polish army and ethnic minorities were united, they could still work hard to stop the advance of the opposing army. Ethnic minorities have not been able to and cannot become a reliable rear guard for Poland. This country, which contains many ethnic minorities, has failed to unite as a strong army due to the oppression of ethnic minorities. The above are all Poland's fundamental weaknesses and the true reasons for Poland's military failure." (September 14th, TASS)

Berlin: The German news agency deeply regrets the accidental shooting down of a Dutch aircraft outside Dutch territory. It issued a statement, stating, "We fully understand the Netherlands' determination to firmly maintain its neutrality and not be subjected to any infringement. We deeply regret the unfortunate incident of the sacrifice of a Dutch aircraft and the serious threat to the Dutch pilots. On the other hand, the pilot of the German reconnaissance plane is not to be blamed, as the incident occurred due to the various unfortunate circumstances that are inevitable during wartime." (September 14th, Haitong)

Berlin: The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating: "A German reconnaissance plane was flying near the Dutch island of Ameland when a Dutch plane suddenly pursued it. At that time, the German plane mistook it for an enemy plane and immediately shot it down. It was not until the Dutch plane landed that its nationality was identified. It then landed and rescued the four Dutch pilots. Fortunately, the pilots only suffered minor injuries. Afterwards, the Dutch side also admitted its mistake because it failed to identify the nationality of the German plane, causing the misunderstanding. In addition, another German plane was forced to land on Ameland due to engine damage. (September 13th, Havas)

The Hague, Netherlands: Officials recently announced that a German military seaplane landed in Dutch territorial waters off the coast of Ameland. It was immediately seized, and its pilot was detained. (September 13th, Havas)

Copenhagen, Denmark: A foreign aircraft flew over the Øresund Strait (between Sweden and Denmark) this morning.

### 義國保持　軸心政策
Italy Maintains Axis Policy

Rome: The Giornale d'Italia recently reviewed Italy's foreign policy, stating that its key points are five: (1) Italy continues to pursue the Axis policy and has not changed its course. Its reserved attitude toward the current war is because Italy is a "non-belligerent country" and must respect the international obligations it has previously accepted. (2) Italy's failure to join the war is because Mussolini does not want to waste manpower. German Führer Hitler also notified Prime Minister Mussolini that the country's strength is sufficient to win alone. (3) Italy has a strong military force and is now ready to fight. Mussolini will use it to join the scales at the appropriate time. (4) Fascist Italy does not want to be all things to all people but is moving forward on the right path. With this decision, Germany will surely win. When the time comes for the old plutocratic countries to be replaced by young and all-powerful countries, Italy will surely get its due share. (5) Italy will surely achieve its suspended goal. In essence, its demands for Tunis, Gibraltar, and the Suez Canal will be achieved. In short, the Italy under the leadership of Prime Minister Mussolini is not what it used to be. In the past, the Italian nation shed its blood all over the world so that other countries could enjoy civilization, freedom, and wealth, while it was willing to endure hardship. This is not what Italy is talking about today. (September 14th, Havas)

One newspaper stated that the new cabinet may not be permanent and may be reorganized again sooner or later to become a true wartime cabinet. The right-wing newspaper Le Temps stated, "It is an innovation for the Prime Minister to serve concurrently as head of national defense and foreign affairs. At a time when the government often makes important decisions and executes them quickly, this move is appropriate." (September 14th, Havas)

### British Intelligence Agency's Failure to Fulfill Duties Arouses Criticism from Parliamentarians

London - Today in the British House of Commons, there was considerable criticism of the newly established intelligence agency for its failure to promptly release important news. Prime Minister Chamberlain stated that the intelligence agency only began working after the outbreak of hostilities, and during times of military urgency, errors were inevitable, causing difficulties for newspapers. He expressed regret for such mistakes but was gratified by the cooperation of the newspapers with the government. The government is eager to provide the public with the most detailed information to eliminate their doubts, which is the principle the government intends to implement. Labour leader Greenwood stated that, looking back to last week, the intelligence agency only issued a very simple report after a delay regarding the glorious achievement of the British Air Force in bombing a German warship in the Kiel naval port, and never informed the public of the glorious significance of this operation. Two days later, the Prime Minister gave a detailed report on this air raid in the House of Commons, and then the intelligence agency gradually released the details of the operation. This operation proved the courage and determination of the British Air Force, and for the sake of encouraging the Air Force and the public, the details of this great undertaking by the British Air Force under dangerous conditions should have been announced as soon as possible. The Prime Minister had previously admitted the error and hoped for future improvements, but the news released from France on Monday night and early Tuesday morning regarding the arrival of British troops in France still left people speechless. The intelligence agency's handling of this news caused national panic and wasted unnecessary funds. Editorials in various newspapers used the term "chaotic," which was not surprising. This was the worst kind of chaos and should be explained in detail. If such situations are not prevented, they will greatly affect the national psyche and have more serious consequences for newspapers overseas, as the world is eager for news. If news cannot be obtained from Britain, rumors and propaganda will be adopted. The British side has not taken effective counter-measures, so Hitler's propaganda is now poisoning world opinion to the disadvantage of Britain, providing completely false ideas to neutral countries, obscuring the truth about Britain and overseas. Liberal Party leader Sinclair also said that the intelligence agency's handling of affairs was extremely chaotic and failed to fulfill its extremely important duties, resulting in the public at home and abroad receiving insufficient and delayed news. Home Secretary Hoare acknowledged in his reply that there had been misunderstandings and regrettable confusion on Monday night but said that arrangements had been reorganized and that each department had a senior official in the department all day long, maintaining close contact with each other. He believed that situations like Monday night would not happen again. As for the British Air Force's bombing of the German naval port, it was difficult to issue a public statement before the facts were verified, resulting in a slight delay. However, it has now been decided that general public statements can be issued quickly in the future, without waiting for all the details to be known. As for inspection, the government is willing to handle it on a cooperative basis. The government provides newspapers with certain general regulations, but newspapers do not have to send every news item through the inspection office. Responsible reporters can use telephones and wireless telephones to the United States. Inspectors are stationed in the telegraph office to work nearby, reviewing telegrams. Telegrams in clear code in various languages can now be passed by inspectors in the telegraph office who are proficient in various languages. Although important government telegrams still have priority, reporters' telegrams will not be delayed until after government telegrams have been sent. (Reuters, 14th)

### Air Raid Alert in Southern England

London - An air raid alert was issued today on the Sussex coast in southern England. Residents in the area took shelter in air raid shelters and remained extremely calm. The alert was lifted twenty minutes later. (Havas, 14th)

### Czech Army Stands Alone

Paris - Czech sources here declared today that the Czech troops organized in France will not be listed as foreign legions or volunteer forces, but formally as troops of the Allied nations, since the democratic nations have not legally recognized Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia. The Czech troops will establish their own command and headquarters, participating in the war under the supreme command of France. The command duties will be undertaken by the French military commission led by General Faucher, who has held the same position in Prague for many years. The political representative of the army will be the Czech provisional government led by former Czech President Beneš. The British and French governments are currently in negotiations regarding the recognition of this provisional government. (Reuters, 14th)

### Chinese Forces in Northern Henan Recover Wen County and Chongyi; Japanese Retreat Towards Qinyang; Chinese Forces Pursuing in Multiple Directions

Luoyang - The Japanese forces in northern Henan have been constantly active since occupying Wen County in February of this year. Since the 7th, the Chinese × unit has been active on the Qin-Chong and Qin-Bo highways, adopting a strategy of converging encirclement, vigorously attacking the Japanese forces in Wen County and Chongyi. After a week of bloody battles, they achieved successive victories, becoming unstoppable. On the evening of the 13th, they successively recovered Wen County and Chongyi, killing many Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese forces retreated towards Qinyang. The Chinese × unit is consoling the people while pursuing in multiple directions.

### Fierce Battles Unfold on the Hunan-Hubei Front

Miluo - The Japanese forces in northern Hunan are entrenched along Yanglousi via Zhongfang. Over the past three days, the Chinese forces have launched attacks on this line in several directions, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese forces in the vicinity of Zhongfang and Yanglousi. The Japanese forces have now been cut into several sections by the Chinese forces and are being encircled and annihilated separately.

### Sweep Away Newspaper Advocates for Centralized Political Power

Chongqing - This morning, the "Sweep Away" newspaper published an article strongly opposing the proposal for China to immediately establish a constitutional government. It argued that at this time of severe national crisis and nationwide resistance, it is necessary to concentrate power to ensure efficiency, speed, and secrecy. Constitutional rights are temporarily suspended during wartime, as is the case in various Western countries. The motivation behind this proposal is simply to establish laws allowing parties other than the Kuomintang to exist. However, such matters should be discussed after the war ends. (Reuters, 14th)

### Japanese Forces Prepare to Invade Shashi and Yichang; Secretly Plot to Cut Off Contact Between Shashi and Yichang; Chinese Side Fully Prepared

Chongqing - According to a certain Chinese official who recently returned here from the front lines in western Hubei, the situation there is very tense due to the Japanese side's preparations to attack Shashi and Yichang. Currently, the Japanese side is concentrating a large number of Japanese warships in Yuezhou, preparing to attack Shashi and Yichang along the Yangtze River. At the same time, the Japanese army is preparing to concentrate the forces of three divisions as the basis for a westward advance. Judging from the Japanese deployment, it seems they intend to launch a joint attack by land, air, and sea. The task of the Japanese navy is to break the blockade line between Yuezhou and Shashi, while the army advances along the land route. It is reported that the Japanese have already crossed the Han River in the Shayang area and are now attempting to occupy Shilipu, 30 miles north of Shashi, in order to cut off the contact between Shashi and Yichang, and also to cut off the contact between Yichang and the northwestern part of Hubei province, as Shilipu is the intersection of highways in various parts of Hubei province. According to the official, although Japanese aircraft constantly bomb the rear cities of the Chinese army in Hubei province, business is still as usual everywhere. At the same time, the Chinese military authorities in central Hubei are fully prepared for the Japanese offensive. (Associated Press, 14th)

### Changzhi and Changzi Under Siege

### Chinese Official Observation: U.S. Statement on Unchanged Far East Policy Intended to Warn Japanese Actions; U.S. Determined Not to Allow Japan to Seize Rights in China During European War Opportunity

Chongqing - President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull declared that there has been no change in the United States' Far East policy. It is believed here that this is a warning to Japanese actions aimed at establishing a "central government" and reducing the rights of foreigners. It is also a kind of support in response to the Japanese request for Britain and France to withdraw their troops from China. Chinese officials here believe that the United States will never allow Japan to take advantage of the European war opportunity to eliminate the rights of European countries in China. (Associated Press, 14th)

### Japanese Forces in Northern Jiangxi Attempt to Cross Jin River; Repelled

Dongxiang - Around Lainiaoshan, Jinggangling, and Mozishan northeast of Gaoyou City, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers, 30+ machine guns, and 10+ cannons have been constantly shelling the south bank of Jin River, attempting to cover infantry crossing the river and invading.

### Chinese Forces in Guangdong Province Recapture Dawangtou

Zhaoqing - This morning, Japanese forces from Jiangmen suddenly launched a fierce artillery attack on Lile Town, engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese forces until dusk. The Japanese retreated without success. (14th Dispatch)

Sihui - At Shenshi hour (3-5 PM) on the 11th, Japanese forces from the Zhongshan area divided into more than 300 troops, covered by dense artillery fire, attempting to attack Dawangtou. The Chinese defending forces rose up to meet the attack, resulting in a fierce battle. Eventually, due to the intense Japanese artillery fire, the Chinese army retreated slightly. By Haishi hour (9-11 PM), reinforcements arrived, and taking advantage of the Japanese forces' unstable footing, launched a large-scale counterattack, quickly recapturing Dawangtou, with many captured. (13th Dispatch)

### Soviet Union Denies Occupying Manchurian Territory

Moscow - According to a Reuters correspondent in Chongqing, an American journalist recently toured the "Man"Mongolian border area, pointing out that the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces had occupied most of the Manchurian region after winning the battle. TASS has been authorized to declare that the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces have not occupied, nor do they intend to occupy, an inch of "Manchurian" territory. The Reuters report is purely fabricated. (TASS, 18th)

Beiping - Local troop movements and news from the three northeastern provinces are now arousing various speculations. It is unknown whether the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in China will pay more attention to China or the Soviet Union. There are already many military empty cars running along the Pinghan Railway. The Japanese spokesperson here does not acknowledge it, perhaps wanting to transport troops back to Shanxi Province. At the same time, according to very reliable foreign sources, the Soviet forces broke through the Japanese main force on the Nomonhan front line a few days ago, and there is also news from Changchun that the Soviet army advanced five kilometers along the three-thousand-kilometer front. For this reason, people here generally predict that the Japanese will now take action again to restore the Mongolian border. (Reuters, 14th)

Beiping - According to local Chinese newspapers, the Japanese army has sent 45,000 Chinese laborers to Mongolia to strengthen the defense line in Inner Mongolia. Another 50,000 Chinese laborers will be sent to the area successively this month. Furthermore, according to reliable foreign sources, the Japanese army in Shanxi and Shandong has already withdrawn. (Associated Press, 14th)

### Military Spokesman Discusses War Situation on All Fronts in the Past Week: September 6th to September 12th

Chongqing - A military commission spokesman discussed the activities of Japanese forces on all fronts this week (September 6th to September 12th). After repeated attacks by our loyal and brave soldiers, they were repeatedly thwarted. Now, they have added a so-called "Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army," attempting to use institutional reforms to conceal the failure of the invasion of China. Regarding the progress of the operations, the important points are approximately as follows:

Shanxi Front: After our army in southeastern Shanxi recovered the important stronghold of Jincheng and killed more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers, they fled north through Gaoping to the Changzhi, Huguan, Changzi, and Lucheng area. Our officers and soldiers exerted even more courage and pursued in various directions. It is estimated that the central route, since recovering Gaoping last week, advanced north along the Baixin Highway, besieging Changzhi and successively recovering various strongholds, including Zizhang, Sudianzhen, and Xinyicun. The right wing thoroughly cleared out the remnants of the Japanese forces near Huguan and Lucheng, east of the Baixin Highway, tightly surrounding the county seats, and defeated the Japanese forces that invaded Wuxiang from Qin County, cutting off the road for reinforcements. Huguan County was recovered on the 9th. After recovering Baodianzhen and Tunliu County, the left wing continued to attack Changzi, successively recovering various strongholds west of the Baixin Highway, including Tangdong, Wangjiabao, Tufangcun, Hetoucun, Xidonghe, and Shitoucun, occupying the southwest passes, and the county seat was immediately recovered. In total, in this campaign, more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers were killed before and after. As for the Japanese forces who invaded western Shanxi along the Zhongli Highway, after being fiercely attacked head-on, they successively recovered places such as Jundu and Mucun, with more than 600 casualties. They are currently attacking Liulin.

Henan-Hubei Front: The Japanese army was extremely panicked after our army in eastern Henan attacked Qixian last week, occupying the east and west passes. They dispatched troops to reinforce Qianjiang in central Hubei for days, once infiltrating Yujiaqiao and shelling us. After our army crossed the river and launched a flanking attack, they did not dare to engage and fled back into the city. Furthermore, Japanese forces from the western side of the river were annihilated after our advance, with more than 100 horses killed. They retreated to Yaodi. The Japanese forces on the outskirts of Jingshan City were besieged by us for days, with more than half annihilated. Several attempts to break through failed and are still being surrounded and annihilated. As for the enemy in southern Hubei, they repeatedly attempted to infiltrate Shentangpu from Nanlinqiao for days, but were repelled by us, with more than 200 killed and wounded. On the 7th, our army attacked Jietouguan and recovered it, cutting off the connection between Nanlinqiao and Baini Bridge. Subsequently, our army divided its forces again and attacked Beigang, attacking between Linxiang and Yanglousi on the 10th, capturing many. On the 12th, they attacked the Japanese forces southeast of Baini Bridge, annihilating Japanese officer Kyu Ta-lang and more than 200 officers and soldiers. Overall, in southern Hubei, the Chinese and Japanese armies fought fiercely from north of the Xinqiang River to Nanlinqiao. Although the remnant Japanese forces struggled desperately, the Chinese officers and soldiers were brave and decisive, and took the upper hand everywhere. The Japanese army is now unable to move.

Chongqing - It has been found that imported goods that are necessary for the people's livelihood during the war of resistance are not on the embargo list. The Ministry of Finance has drafted tax reduction measures for imported goods and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for approval. Starting from September 2nd, all will be levied at one-third of the current tax rate. The National Government's order on September 1st regarding the tax reduction of essential goods for the people's livelihood is recorded as follows: According to the Executive Yuan's report, it is now noted that since the two years of the war of resistance, the people have endured hardships and made sacrifices. In order to provide the people with essential goods for their livelihood at a low price, detailed import tax reduction measures have been determined. All goods not embargoed in the measures for prohibiting the import of goods during the extraordinary period on July 1st of this year will be levied at one-third of the current import tax rate, effective from September 2nd, until the end of the war. After checking, it has been found that imported goods that are necessary for the people's livelihood are not on the embargo list. At this time of war of resistance, tax reductions can be granted. The proposed imposition of one-third of the current tax rate from September 2nd of this year until the end of the war is still feasible and should be approved for implementation. This order should be forwarded to be observed and implemented. (14th Dispatch)

### U.S. President Orders Convening of Special Session of Congress; Majority of Senators and Representatives Favor Repealing Arms Embargo Provision of Neutrality Act; Roosevelt Issues Statement on Prices

Washington - President Roosevelt has called a special session of Congress to convene on September 21, fulfilling his promise to find a way to repeal the arms embargo provision of the Neutrality Act after the outbreak of the European war. The President has again sent a telegram to the leaders of both Democratic and Republican parties in the House and Senate, asking them to gather at the White House on September 20 for an informal meeting. The President's decision to call a special session of Congress is the result of inquiring about the attitudes of individual members of Congress, as the President is now confident that there will be a majority in the House to support the repeal of the ban, and more than half of the Senate will support it. (Reuters, 14th)

Washington - The U.S. government does not intend to take any steps to curb rising prices for the time being, as can be seen from President Roosevelt's statements today. The President declared that cotton prices are still too low, and wheat can rise to at least $1.16 per bushel without harming consumers. He is now paying attention to the value of copper, as it is profitable to sell copper at $0.125 per pound, so he decided not to let it rise as it did during the last European war. (Reuters, 13th)

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday ordered the convening of a special session of Congress to be held on September 21. The administration will debate with isolationists regarding the amendment of the Neutrality Act at this meeting. The intention of the administration is to have Congress amend the arms embargo clause in the Neutrality Act, so that the United States can sell arms to the European belligerents on a cash-and-carry basis. The President will deliver a special speech at the special session of Congress, stating his position on amending the Neutrality Act. If the Neutrality Act can be amended according to the wishes of the administration, it will greatly benefit Britain and France, as their navies have almost completely driven German warships out of the high seas. The special session of Congress will see a fierce battle between the White House and the isolationists in Congress. Senator Borah and President Ni, who proposed changing the Supreme Court, launched a major attack. The President officially signed the order to convene a special session of Congress yesterday, with the time set for noon on September 21. In a conversation with the leaders of the two parties before the opening, the President will urge them to pay attention to the current world crisis. (Associated Press, 14th)

London - Members of the British Parliament today do not hide their joy at the U.S. President's calling of a special session of Congress. Government lawmakers believe that amending the Neutrality Act is a matter of U.S. internal affairs and are unwilling to express an opinion, but opposition lawmakers are free to discuss it without any reservations. According to Labour leader Greenwood, "The American public seems to have recognized the center of gravity of the world situation, and has understood the indirect relationship with the democratic countries." (Associated Press, 14th)

Washington - Prominent isolationist Senator Ni declared yesterday that it would be unthinkable if the United States participated in the affairs of European belligerent countries, and said that he welcomed the special session of Congress convened on September 21. The administration can defend all opinions. They believe that opposing the wishes of the administration is a pro-Hitler expression. Ni also said that isolationists will do everything possible to oppose any action by the government to associate with European belligerent countries. Isolationists will let the people of the country know "the direction in which Roosevelt's policies are leading." Other isolationists also expressed satisfaction with the decision to convene a special session of Congress, saying that this would allow a decision to be made on the Neutrality Act. Representative Rogers of Massachusetts said that she hoped that Congress would meet regularly before this world crisis passed. Other members of Congress said that various proposals, such as those concerning relief and prevention of espionage, will be put forward at this session. (Associated Press, 14th)

Washington - Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, it is believed here that if the cash-and-carry provision for abolishing the arms embargo is adopted, it will benefit Japan in the Far East. Therefore, when the cash-and-carry clause is passed, the Pittman proposal to sanction Japan must also be passed simultaneously. Otherwise, we can only abolish the entire U.S. Neutrality Act and adhere purely to international law as a guide, so that the United States can cope with both Europe and the Far East. (Associated Press, 14th)

### U.S. Navy Aircraft Squadron Ordered to Pearl Harbor; Long-Distance Flight Across Pacific

San Diego - Fourteen U.S. Navy bombers made a non-stop group flight from San Diego Bay to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii yesterday. This military movement was the result of secret orders, so few knew about it beforehand. The bomber squadron had a total of 95 personnel, led by Lieutenant Colonel Ingersoll. The last aircraft departed here at 3:30 PM, when the weather was quite clear and the wind direction was exceptionally favorable for navigation. According to naval officials, this flight was "extremely secret," so the aircraft could not report their location to their base by radio during the flight. (Associated Press, 14th)

### Japanese Government's Diplomatic Policy

Tokyo: The "Nichinichi Shimbun" newspaper today published an editorial discussing various aspects of Japan's diplomatic policy, and the Japanese government's decision to grant the Prime Minister the supreme authority to handle state affairs. The article stated that Britain is currently inquiring with Japan about the possibility of reopening the Tokyo Conference, but unless Britain declares its willingness to resolve the Tianjin economic dispute within two or three meetings, Japan does not see any benefit in reopening the conference. As for the Tianjin economic dispute, it arose from Japan's demand for the handover of Chinese silver stored in the Chinese-British Bank in the British Concession of Tianjin, and the prohibition of the circulation of Chinese legal tender. The article also mentioned Japanese-American relations, stating that some quarters in Japan are closely watching the attitude of the United States. There are rumors that the United States will increase its naval presence in Shanghai, which they see as a precursor to a hardening of American policy towards Japan. However, most Japanese people feel that the responsibility of jointly undertaking police duties in various areas of the Public Concession can be decided through meetings convened by the commanders of the various countries' troops stationed in Shanghai. The increase in the American naval presence in Shanghai is unlikely to become a major cause of friction between Japan and the United States. Furthermore, Japan hopes that the various problems arising from the United States' abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation can be resolved through a general adjustment of relations between the two countries. As for Italy and Germany, the Japanese government still recognizes the validity of the Anti-Comintern Pact. However, in Japanese diplomacy, the position of the Axis must be resolved in accordance with Japan's independent judgment. This is also due to the current relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany. The article concluded by stating that the Japanese government currently intends to adhere to a policy of non-intervention in the European war and to maintain Japan's strictly free hand in diplomacy.

### British Post Office Restricts Foreign Postal Money Orders

London: The Post Office announced today that people buying foreign money orders from post offices (including those sent to British Egypt, Sudan, Hong Kong, Canada, and Newfoundland) must not exceed ten pounds in face value, and must state the reason for buying the money order in advance.

### The Shift in the New International Situation on the Eve of the Outbreak of the European War by Uncle Di; A Review of Britain's Errors in Cunning Diplomatic Policies; The Inside Story of the Sudden Compromise Between Germany and the Soviet Union; Japan Suffers Germany's Absolute Abandonment

For the past few months, what has been worrying most enlightened and farsighted people in the Allied countries is the fundamental redivision of the international situation: the German-Italian-Spanish group dominating the European continent; France, stripped of all neighboring allies, having to rely solely on the other side of the English Channel, working closely with Britain, and then placing its greatest reliance on the United States far across the Atlantic; China and the Soviet Union in the Far East further joining hands. And the greatest prerequisite for all of this is undoubtedly the establishment of a detente between Germany and the Soviet Union; and as a result, the greatest prerequisite for this buffer relationship is undoubtedly the complete neutralization of all countries between the Arctic Ocean and the Black Sea. Among all the unfavorable international situations that one can imagine for Britain, this is probably the most unfavorable. However, under the Chamberlain cabinet's stubborn pursuit of its unique path, this is an inevitable outcome. Therefore, in recent months, their efforts to combat the "Chamberlain cabinet's line" can certainly be regarded as having been exerted to the greatest extent. However, in the end, because their strength was still insufficient to promote the early establishment of a British-French-Soviet military alliance, they disappointedly saw the building of a buffer zone between Germany and the Soviet Union amid Prime Minister Chamberlain's strong atmosphere of appeasement towards Germany.

The announcement of the "German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact" came like a bolt from the blue. The first to feel a major unease, presumably, was Japan in the Far East; the second most uneasy, of course, was Britain and France.

Britain's tension and anger in the past two days are, of course, needless to say. Some people attribute this to the Soviet Union's "betrayal" of Britain and France and the "peace front," while others attribute this to Germany's "betrayal" of its own ally Japan. And a very strange and glaring phenomenon is that some people are actually feeling sorry for Japan's grievances against Germany, which is a miracle that has never been seen before. Of course, that is only to vent their anger against Germany and the Soviet Union. Others believe that this is due to the error created by Polish Foreign Minister Beck. But they all have a difficult to express secret, that is, the major error of the "Chamberlain cabinet line." On this, everyone in Britain now can be said to be crystal clear. However, in order to avoid internal friction and cope with the current crisis, in the past two days, following the "German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact," all attacks on Prime Minister Chamberlain have suddenly ceased within Britain. Except for the Communist Party's newspapers, all British newspapers and opinion organs have also unified their arguments. In other words, it has entered a state of war. As seen from a wartime perspective, this is naturally good; but as seen from an emergency diplomatic measure before the outbreak of war, this contains a very serious crisis.

We must know that even though Germany and the Soviet Union have formally signed a "non-aggression pact," if they cannot completely neutralize all countries between them, then even with this pact, the buffer zone will still be empty talk. Among all the countries between the Arctic Ocean and the Black Sea, the most important one at the moment is, of course, only Poland. On Poland, the key to the overall victory or defeat of Britain and France against Germany and Italy in Europe's future contest is hanging. What is Poland's attitude towards Britain and France? The reporter has already said in a previous communication, and will not repeat it now. Speaking of this, every observer who loves Britain cannot help but regret the errors of the British government's diplomatic application to Poland in the past two or three months. Since the alliance has been announced, what should follow is always sincere acceptance. Then, may I ask, what are the secret contacts, guided by Prime Minister Chamberlain, constantly aiming to sacrifice Danzig to Germany, and the actions, led by Finance Minister Simon, vigorously sabotaging loans to Poland, for? Under such circumstances, can you be sure that Poland will not feel disheartened? Will it fully trust Britain and France?

Therefore, our original assumption was that the first action of Britain after the convening of the emergency parliamentary meeting should be to reorganize the current government, adding Churchill, Eden, Duff Cooper, and others to form an expanded cabinet. This has long been the unanimous request of all parties in Britain. Unexpectedly, the first action of yesterday's parliament was to instead grant the current cabinet full power for emergency measures.

Will the Chamberlain cabinet change its past style? Until this time, can Germany and Italy really believe that Britain and France will definitely rise up to aid Poland? Is Poland completely reassured by the aid of Britain and France? This series of questions is really the biggest key to the future European situation. Here, I still do not have definitive evidence that I can judge. However, my intention is to remind everyone to pay close attention to this life-and-death place.

Below, I intend to give a general objective review of the various aspects of this new international situation.

(1) Two Most Fundamental Changes

In recent years, everyone has become accustomed to two of the most fundamental explanations for the international situation: one is that, on the Soviet side, in order to prevent the formation of the "Anti-Communist Crusade," it has to be prepared at any time to join hands with all anti-aggression countries, even Britain and France. This is the origin of the Soviet Union's "collective security" slogan. The other is that, on the German side, in order to conceal its own expansion, it has to constantly advocate anti-communism and an attack on the Soviet Union. This has produced the so-called "Anti-Comintern Group." Therefore, the possibility of a German-Soviet detente is often immediately considered by everyone to be extremely difficult to achieve.

No matter what, a Soviet-German detente is absolutely impossible, right? - Those who think this way, like Chamberlain, dared to openly let go, on the one hand, secretly contacting Germany, instigating an attack on the Soviet Union, and at the same time, negotiating with the Soviet Union on the so-called "peace front limited to Europe;" on the other hand, uniting with various countries to prevent Hitler from expanding again, and at the same time, even though Japan and the Soviet Union have entered a state of semi-warfare in the Far East, Britain is still conducting what is called "Tokyo Negotiations" with Japan.

Some people had already warned people like Chamberlain: Isn't this promoting a Soviet-German detente? And these days, France has repeatedly sent warnings about this point.

In the end, it was this misbelief that the Soviet Union and Germany could hardly ease tensions that messed things up. They only kept in mind the "collective security" slogan and the international environment at the time of the "Anti-Comintern Group" organization, and ignored several of the biggest changes in the international situation in the past two or three years, which affected the fundamentals of the international situation.

The first is the success of China's resistance war. The second is the continuous and amazing expansion of Soviet strength.

The success of China's war of resistance is now beyond doubt. Except for some internal difficulties in China that still need to be overcome, from the perspective of the international environment, China's prospects are a bright road. Therefore, all countries have to consider their overall diplomatic policies in light of this new situation. First of all, of course, is the Soviet Union. Once the situation of China's war of resistance is stabilized, the danger of the Soviet Union being attacked from both east and west has been completely lifted. With such a friendly country as China sitting in its east, it can attack or defend against all enemies in Europe to the west. Therefore, compared to all international changes, it is watching China's war of resistance with the greatest concern. Last spring, when Special Envoy Sun Zhe-sheng passed through London, he said: "When China can defeat Japan alone, the Soviet Union will not move; but if the Chinese situation is very critical, the Soviet Union will definitely launch a joint attack on Japan." This is naturally not without basis.

As for Germany, since recalling its military advisors in China last year, Hitler had a very clear idea of the strength of China and Japan from their reports. These military advisors unanimously believed that Japan had no hope of winning; on the contrary, the front line would become longer and longer day by day, and the time would become longer and longer, and in the end, China would have a day of victory. After that, Germany had lost hope for the Japanese army's help, and the remaining contacts disappointed Germany one by one. Therefore, from Germany's point of view, Japan's value in the "Anti-Comintern Group" was decreasing day by day. (To be continued)

### Longzhou, Guangxi; Zhennanguan Was Tragically Bombed by Japanese Planes; Goods Worth Millions of Dollars Were Lost; Japanese Planes Flew from the Qinlian Sea Area

Longzhou Correspondence: Guangxi's export of products overseas has always taken Wuzhou as its concentration point, transporting them to Guangzhou or Hong Kong via the Xijiang River, and its imported goods are also the same. Since the Sanshui River Estuary was blocked by the Japanese army, the Xijiang River shipping has been completely suspended. Therefore, most of Guangxi's products have been changed to Longzhou Zhennanguan, taking the Dian-Viet Railway to Annan for export. Since the route of goods transportation has changed, the once barren and desolate Zhennanguan has suddenly become bustling. The Central Resources Committee, the Guangxi Trade Office, and other transportation companies have all set up offices there. Zhennanguan is the throat of Dian, Yue and Gui transportation, with highways leading in all directions. After the goods are concentrated in Zhennanguan, they can be transported to Chongqing, Guiyang, Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning and other places by highway. Hundreds of trucks transporting goods travel every day, weaving back and forth. The goods of various transportation companies, after being inspected by the Longzhou Customs, are re-inspected by the inspection office established by the local government and the Qian'ai checkpoint, checking the import and export of goods. Anyone exporting goods from Longzhou to Zhennanguan to take the train must go through three inspection procedures before they can pass. The same is true for imports. Recently, due to the prosperous entry and exit of goods from various transportation companies, the inspection procedures are cumbersome, resulting in the accumulation of goods around the checkpoint, like hills and mounds. Some unscrupulous officials take advantage of the opportunity for shippers to compete for priority, and then profit from it. If the shippers make gifts, the goods will be inspected as soon as they arrive, without any stagnation or difficulty. On the contrary, their goods will have to be piled up and waited for, and even after waiting for more than a week, they have not yet been inspected. Because there are too many goods piled up at each checkpoint, it has gradually attracted the attention of the Japanese. From the 14th to the 20th of last month, Japanese planes have been flying to bomb Zhennanguan and Longzhou, continuously for as many as six times. From the 25th to the 30th, there were three consecutive bombings. After Longzhou Zhennanguan was tragically bombed, most of the public goods stored were moved to Pingxiang and Ningming for storage. They were detected by Japanese planes again. On the 2nd of this month, Japanese planes flew to bomb Ningming and Pingxiang. According to investigation, the Japanese planes took off from the Qinlian Sea Area. There is currently a dragon-class aircraft carrier anchored in this sea area, which is responsible for flying to bomb Longzhou Zhennanguan. It can be seen that the Japanese army has paid attention to destroying China's transportation and resources. It is heard that recently, most of the goods imported from Zhennanguan are gasoline, kerosene, diesel, matches, flour, medicines, automobiles, and electrical materials and mechanical parts. The imported goods are tung oil, tea, tungsten, tin, anise oil, star anise, cinnamon, and cowhide, which are controlled by the Resources Committee Trade Office. The loss of this bombing is mainly in gasoline, tung oil, vehicles, tungsten, tin, and other goods. On the 15th of last month, the Longzhou Customs and the Zhennanguan Inspection Branch were completely bombed. An American customs officer was also injured and is now receiving treatment in Liangshan. The goods burned for more than 20 hours before being put out. The loss should be more than several million dollars. According to the opinions of local people, the reasons why the loss of public and private goods is so heavy are as follows: (1) There are too many imported and exported goods, and the inspectors have not been able to complete the inspection on time, and they are still stagnant and piled up; (2) Due to too few transportation trucks and ships, it is impossible to clear the accumulated goods; (3) The officials in charge of transportation failed to store the goods in a safe area in advance, and there were no good warehouses near the checkpoint. Due to the above reasons, the Japanese planes took advantage of the gap to bomb, and burned the goods that had been transported with difficulty, which is a pity.

### The Blood Debt of Min Province Suffering Tragic Bombing by Japanese Planes; As of July This Year, The Total Number of Dead and Wounded Reached More Than 1,000 People

Fuzhou Correspondence: In this province, Japanese planes have been wildly bombing repeatedly. The deaths and injuries of innocent civilians and property losses are urgently awaiting investigation. It is now heard that the Provincial Relief Association has reported the investigation of each county and district. As of the end of July this year, the statistics show that the rampant Japanese planes dropped 1,556 bombs, killing 344 people, wounding 516 people, and displacing more than 1,100 households due to the disaster. The property loss was 5,126,342 yuan. The counties of Fuzhou, Minhou, Lianjiang, Jinjiang, Tongan, and Longxi suffered the most severe losses. In Tai, Zhenhai, and Xiaocheng in Lianjiang alone, more than 400 houses were destroyed on July 23 alone, and more than 2,100 people were displaced, with property losses of 2 million. The remaining counties and districts that have not been reported are not included. The association has issued 77,200 yuan in air raid relief funds, and the amount that each county and district has drawn from the county relief fund in advance is not included.

The main points of compiling wartime supplementary teaching materials for primary and secondary schools are: "In terms of politics", (1) clarifying national policies, (2) unifying will, (3) invigorating the spirit of long-term war resistance, (4) increasing students' understanding of the national conditions and the current situation, (5) mobilizing the people's strength; "In terms of teaching", (1) adapting the role (for example, the civics subject must pay special attention to the Three Principles of the People, the Plan for National Reconstruction, the Outline for National Reconstruction, the National Duty, the Recognition of the Nation and Ethnicity, the Political, Economic and Social Conditions of the Country, the Current International Situation, and the Relationship Between Our Country and Other Countries. The national language should appropriately select legends that promote national consciousness, national morality, and exemplary personalities in history who became benevolent and took righteousness as teaching materials. History and geography must focus on the domestic part. Foreign history and geography can be reduced appropriately. History teaching must pay special attention to the past glory, anti-Japanese national heroes, and the historical facts of Japan's invasion of China since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 in the history of the country. Geography must pay attention to the evolution of the territory of past dynasties, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, the current national defense situation, and the recognition of the regions in each theater of war.), (2) supplementary role (supplementing what is insufficient, providing what is lacking, and changing what is modified), (3) unifying role, (4) counseling role. It is estimated that the wartime supplementary teaching materials compiled by the editorial office are limited to primary and secondary school subjects such as language and society. "In the middle school", there are Chinese, civics, history, and geography. "In the elementary school", there are Chinese, society, and common sense, totaling seven subjects. History and geography are limited to the country. The seven subjects compiled have selected wartime-related materials as teaching materials and have formulated 14 general outlines as follows: (1) Teaching materials related to the needs of the War of Resistance Period, (2) Teaching materials about historical stories of national heroes, etc., (3) Teaching materials about the situation of people suffering in various places during the War of Resistance Period, (4) Teaching materials about the situation of military and civilians resisting the war in various places, (5) Teaching materials about encouraging people to serve in the military, (6) Teaching materials about people in various places should respect and treat the wounded soldiers kindly, (7) Teaching materials about treating the families of soldiers on expedition preferentially, (8) Teaching materials about national defense, (9) Teaching materials about developing industries and increasing production, (10) Teaching materials about organizing and training the people, (11) Teaching materials about enhancing national consciousness and strengthening the national concept, (12) Teaching materials about supporting the government and leaders, (13) Teaching materials about enhancing scientific beliefs and improving the level of scientific knowledge, (14) Other teaching materials related to the Outline of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction,

### National Chongqing Merchant Marine College Registers Old Students in Shanghai

The Wusong Merchant Marine College of the Ministry of Communications was originally located in Wusong, Shanghai. It was temporarily suspended after the August 13th Incident. It was compared to this year's spring inquiry by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Communications to prepare for the establishment of a college, and it was approved by the Executive Yuan in January and changed to a national college. The school site is temporarily set in Chongqing, and a preparatory committee was organized to carry out everything. It is heard that the preparations have now been completed, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ship has been rented as a temporary school building. All the information has been published in this newspaper. It is recently learned that Director Wu of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education is temporarily serving as the president of the school, dividing the school into three departments: navigation, marine engineering, and shipbuilding. Forty or fifty old students of Wusong Merchant Marine College have reported to the Chongqing school. The new students will be recruited in Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces this month. The school authorities have also learned that there are many old students of Wusong Merchant Marine College residing in Shanghai, so they specially held a registration procedure at the Merchant Marine College Alumni Association (address is behind Weili Han Company on Simalu Bund on Sichuan Road).

In the senior singles of lawn tennis, Wang Wenzheng faced Lin Baohua in the semi-finals held at the French Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon.

### Finance: Calm Foreign Exchange Market; Cash Returning to Normal

Yesterday's cash speculation market was calm. The foreign exchange trend was peaceful, and many accounts tended to take profits immediately when the price was high and buy when the price was low. Therefore, the market price fluctuations gradually returned to normal. The difference between the morning and afternoon was less than 100 yuan. The situation was weak at first and then turned firm. Initially, the loosening of foreign exchange caused selling, and many bulls, including gold shops, securities firms, and retail investors, came out, causing the situation to be quite weak for a while, falling to a low of 3,975 yuan. Later, as traders turned from selling to buying, and the foreign exchange returned to normal, plus Hong Kong firms entrusted a certain currency exchange firm to buy on their behalf, the price returned to above 4,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the price once rose to a high of 4,065 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop sold on behalf of a wealthy businessman, and retail investors also took profits, causing the price to fall back to 4,040 yuan at the close.

A certain currency exchange firm bought a total of 30 taels from cash gold shops and other firms for 4,035 yuan.

Securities firms and silver shops sold a total of 40 taels to cash gold shops for 3,975 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop suddenly turned from selling to buying, and the market sentiment stabilized immediately, returning to 3,990 yuan.

Shortly after, the price increased by 25 yuan. Currency exchange firms traded 30 taels with each other for 4,020 yuan. At noon, the price fell slightly. A currency exchange firm sold 10 taels to the 　 firm for 4,010 yuan, which was the noon closing price.

Initially, Huabao Bank and other banks continued to sell, resulting in a slightly weaker potential situation. The British gold was 4 shillings and 625 points, and the American exchange was 6.6875 yuan. Later, the Western firm Sassoon absorbed some, so the situation returned to normal at noon.

This was due to the contraction of the British and American exchange rates. After the opening, the trend was peaceful, with no changes. When the HSBC's listed price was announced and did not change, and the silver balance tax was announced, the price increased sharply by 0.04 yuan. After that, Huabao Bank suddenly sold spot British gold at 4 shillings 0.3125 points and 0.0625 points to the foreign bank Maigali, and then sold spot American exchange at 6.65625 yuan and 6.6875 yuan to a certain bank of Datong.

### Cotton Yarn: Sales Slow, Speculators Sell and Re-mortgage Warehouse Receipts

The yarn market is becoming increasingly volatile, but most people are optimistic, as there is no hope for a drop in raw cotton prices and various sources of supply are blocked. Bull traders are holding tight to their goods and refuse to give up. However, actual demand is shifting towards a slump, and Hong Kong buyers have already purchased large quantities, their capacity being limited. As a result, the spot market for 20-count Double Horse yarn is particularly weak. Those holding goods wish to raise prices, but reality prevents it. Consequently, some are selling off spot goods and moving them into warehouse receipts. Another account states that spot goods previously reached a high of 785 yuan and have already risen to 790 yuan, exceeding the previously decided price. However, the price of warehouse receipts is still 10 to 20 yuan lower than the previous decision, so there is a bullish outlook on warehouse receipts, and goods are being re-mortgaged.

The morning opening for raw yarn was lively, with prices rising again. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 784-785 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 690 yuan, both rising by about 10 yuan. Shortly after, news came that Guangdong buyers were not doing business and purchasing was even slower, causing a sudden drop. Double Horse spot prices fell by 12-13 yuan. By the close of trading, prices had recovered, with spot prices at 780 yuan and warehouse receipt prices at 695 yuan. According to half-day trading statistics, 1,530 bales were traded. Xinhe Factory opened with 50 bales of 20-count Special Five Sons yarn at 660 yuan and 50 bales of 32-count Pine Deer yarn at 780 yuan. Today, 25 pieces of yarn were shipped to Yantai. The quantities purchased by various buyers are listed below:

Fellow traders: 860 Hong Kong: 205

Inland: 405 Fuzhou: 10

Ningbo: 50 Total: 1,530

### Tianjin Factories Purchase Cotton in Shanghai for Northern Transport; Cotton Prices Rise Another 5-6 Yuan

As for the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market opened in the morning with falling prices due to increased selling pressure from outside and arbitrage buying by southern buyers. Foreign cotton merchants also sold aggressively. The price of cotton fell and, by the close of trading, prices were down 16-17 points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market has been weak lately, with yesterday's prices, including forecasts, falling another 2 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 points, and Liverpool cotton fell by 25 pence.

In spot cotton transactions, foreign cotton accounts for the majority. Although native cotton is appearing on the market, sources of supply are obstructed. Only Tongzhou cotton is arriving smoothly, while other varieties are as rare as unicorns and phoenixes. The Hua cotton business has suddenly diminished. Factories, aware of this trend, are constantly searching for foreign cotton. It is reported that the Hengyuan and Beiyang factories in Tianjin, North China, are also purchasing cotton in Shanghai for transport to the north. Given this situation, the cotton market is firm, and prices have risen by another 5-6 yuan. Approximately 1,050 bales of cotton have arrived from northern Jiangsu. The current situation for spot cotton is listed below:

In other news, foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has become even more lively recently, with prices reaching new highs, surprising all parties. It is expected cotton prices will continue to rise because the stock of goods held by traders is nearly exhausted, leading to extremely tight prices. Brazilian cotton has reached a new high price of 230 yuan, White Rock cotton is nearly 170 yuan, and West Indian cotton is over 180 yuan.

### Grains: Rice Prices Continue to Rise; Special Tin Geng Reaches a High Price of 44 Yuan

Zhu Rice: No shipments are arriving from Hexia. It is reported that 15 shipments are on the way to Shanghai. More than 3,000 bags of wheeled bag rice from various places have arrived. People expect continued price increases, and sales in this market are quite good. Merchants are uniformly calling for higher prices, resulting in a slight increase of half a yuan for Gao Geng (glutinous rice) due to the high price of goods. The various Jian varieties continued to rise by about one yuan. Special Tin Geng is opening at 44 yuan, Gao is 42-43 yuan, next is 40 yuan. Su Tong Kun Geng is 42-40 yuan. Hexia early and late rice is out of stock and without a market. Original bags are opening at a high price of 40 yuan, settling at 38 yuan. Bian Yuan (literally "variable yuan", likely a type of rice) is selling well, also increasing by one yuan. Wuxi and other goods are opening at 36 yuan. Hong Kong glutinous rice is also opening at 36-35.5 yuan. New Jian Jiangbei goods are opening at 27.4-26.7 yuan. Chen Wu Jian is 27 yuan, and new Jian is 27 yuan. Jiaxing Kunshan and other new Yang Jian are 28-27.5 yuan. Trading volume is estimated to be no less than 7,000-8,000 bags.

Ke Xian: After rising and then leveling off the day before, the market opened yesterday with news that blocked rice boats had not yet been released, and that 2,000 bags of newly arrived Jiangbei new Xian rice had also been detained at Hongkou. Market sentiment immediately turned upward, and rice shops and retailers were extremely greedy, with prices of new and old Ke Xian rice rising sharply by about one yuan. The market remains firm. Yesterday, Jing Gao Xian reached 29 yuan, Jiangbei Xian was 27.5-26 yuan, and Wu Xian was 27.3-25.4 yuan.

### Flour: Sales to Outside Customers Decline; Wheat Arrives Daily

The current flour market situation continues to be stable. Factory prices remain at 7.2 yuan in cash, which is the retail price in this market. However, returned goods have become more sluggish than before due to cheap dumping by Japanese merchants, generally at 7.35-7.4 yuan. It is reported that Japanese factory goods are selling for only 6.7-6.8 yuan and can be exported, so some outside buyers are purchasing them. The future of local factory flour is inevitably affected. Yesterday, sales to northern and southern customers declined slightly, while stockpilers made some purchases. The price of foreign flour has been rising frequently at its source, and it has reached 8 yuan in Shanghai. The market situation is generally mixed. On the 15th, 16,500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin.

The supply of wheat remains abundant, with about 30,000 bags arriving. Shipments from Chuzhou and Wu Yi and other places have been arriving continuously, due to high prices attracting distant goods. Factories' purchases are gradually slowing down, and outside stockpilers are rarely inquiring. However, those holding goods remain firm in their intention to sell, so the market remains stable. A total of over 14,000 bags of wheat from Wuxi, Danyang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Chuzhou, Guandian, Dachang, Yangzhou, and Wuhu were offered for sale. In addition to 13,000 bags purchased by the Fu and Fu factories, the remainder was purchased by stockpilers. Prices were similar to the previous market.

350 bags of soybeans arrived from Beisha on the 14th, and 4,000 bags were shipped to Tianjin on the 15th. In addition, 500 pieces of raw oil arrived from Qingdao on the 14th.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Expected to Rebound Later

According to a Dutch telegram, the price of coarse white sugar for immediate shipment is small ○.45, at 9.15 Dutch guilders. The local trade association's price assessment was weak in the morning due to continued selling by stockpilers. Spot goods initially fell by 3 yuan, with local warehouse goods at 57 yuan, but later rebounded to 58.3 yuan. Foreign warehouse goods were initially at 56-57 yuan, then rose to 57.5-58.5 yuan, ending only 0.5 yuan higher than the previous day. Re-export goods were down 2-1 yuan, at 45-46 yuan. Taikoo Che Bai (literally "car white", likely a grade or brand of sugar) fell 2.5-1.5 yuan, with B-mark at 62.5-63.5 yuan. The market thinned out later, showing signs of rebound. H-mark Che Chi (literally "car red", likely a grade or brand of sugar) was 45.5-46 yuan, and Dutch spot goods were 47.5-48 yuan, with re-export goods at 40 yuan. Local Mian Bai (literally "cotton white", likely a grade or brand of sugar) was down 2 yuan, with Zhen Ji No. 1 at 58 yuan, No. 2 at 57.5 yuan, No. 3 at 57 yuan, and No. 4 at 56.5 yuan. Local No. 1 Bing (literally "ice", likely a grade or brand of sugar) was down 1 yuan, at 67.5 yuan, and Jing Ming Bing was 69 yuan. Due to certain controls, Hainan Red National Sugar, known for its exceptionally high quality and excellent packaging, is definitely being purchased. Zheng Mian Chi is quoted at 60 yuan, but the trade is settling at 57.5 yuan. According to Jianbang (likely a trade association or specific group of merchants) news, transportation between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu will be open soon, so Diao Qing sugar may arrive next week.

### Seafood: New Red Jade Sea Cucumber is Offered, Asking Price is Extremely High

The initial offering of new Red Jade Sea Cucumber is seen, and because costs are very high, the asking price is extremely high. Jade sea cucumber is as much as 70-80 yuan more expensive than in the spring. The details of the prices of each grade are published in the market price column.

### Piece Goods: Woolens Only Increase in Price, Never Decrease

Woolens and woolen fabrics are increasing in price across the board, regardless of whether they are men's or women's colors and materials. Sellers holding stock are treating them as rare commodities. This is because the cost of foreign goods has risen sharply due to foreign exchange appreciation, and shipments arriving later will be even scarcer. The factory prices of local Shanghai-woven goods, such as the Ewo, Yinfeng, and Zhanghua brands, all exceed current market selling prices. Looking at the recent variety of woolen goods, there is a serious risk that what is sold today cannot be restocked tomorrow, resulting in a situation where the price of all goods only increases and never decreases. The market for winter-demand overcoat woolens is particularly strong and rising.

### Price Increase Statistics for August

Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, the Japanese Naval authorities in Shanghai suddenly invited the British, American, and Italian commanders of the Shanghai garrisons to a meeting at the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters in Hongkou. Those attending included British Major General Simmons, International Settlement Commander Hongbei, American Major Fegan, and Italian Major Vival. Invited to attend as observers were Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Secretary-General Felippu, Chief of Police Bowen, and a French military representative. The Japanese side was represented by the commander of the Japanese Naval Forces in Shanghai and Shanghai Garrison Commander Sakurai. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. Western reporters inquired with the Japanese naval spokesperson about the content of the meeting, but the spokesperson stated, "Under orders, I am not allowed to reveal the reason for the meeting," but added that the meeting was "very important." According to reports from the Da Zhong News Agency, the meeting convened yesterday morning was to discuss adjusting the garrison territories of the various foreign forces in Shanghai. Therefore, the SMC Secretary-General, Chief of Police, and the French military representative were also invited to attend. However, there had been no prior contact between the foreign commanders and the Japanese side. During the meeting, the Japanese side suggested adjusting the defense zone of the Shanghai concessions. One foreign commander questioned how this adjustment would be made. The Japanese side did not provide a definitive answer at the time, only stating that a concrete plan for the adjustment would be submitted in writing to the foreign commanders in a few days. According to foreign sources, the Japanese side presented a simple but confidential plan, one aspect of which was most related to the British military zone north of the Suzhou Creek.

Meeting Convened to Present Plan

According to an Associated Press report from this city on the 14th, the Japanese Naval authorities in Shanghai convened a meeting today with the commanders of the British, Italian, and American garrisons in the city to discuss revising the current defense plan for the International Settlement. The French military authorities in Shanghai also sent a representative to attend as an observer. The Japanese side stated at the meeting that the current defense plan for the International Settlement was drafted in 1931 and revised once in 1934. This plan was designed to defend against unfavorable actions by the Chinese towards the concessions. Now that this threat has been removed by Japan, the current defense plan is obviously no longer suitable for use. The Japanese requested the commanders to express their opinions. As none of the commanders offered any suggestions, the Japanese side announced a brief recess.

Admiral Hepner to Arrive in Shanghai Today

However, after the recess, no suggestions were put forward. Therefore, the Japanese side had to declare the meeting closed. However, as the commanders were leaving, they indicated that the issue was open for discussion. The date for a renewed meeting has not yet been set. It is also reported that Admiral Hepner, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, has suddenly left Qingdao and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (i.e., today). It is feared that this is related to the Japanese proposal this morning.

### Two Conclusions Announced by the Japanese

According to a statement yesterday afternoon by the Japanese naval spokesperson in Shanghai, the meeting of the commanders of the foreign garrisons in Shanghai this morning reached two conclusions: (1) All parties unanimously agreed that the current defense plan for the International Settlement needed to be revised. (2) All parties agreed that the Japanese Marine Corps should draft a revised draft of the defense plan for the International Settlement as a basis for future discussions. According to the spokesperson, the Japanese side had no demands or concrete suggestions, and only wanted to discuss the fundamental principles of defense.

Britain, America, and Italy to Consult on Countermeasures

According to another report, when the Japanese Navy convened the meeting of the Shanghai garrison commanders yesterday, the Japanese naval representative stood up to state the reason for convening the meeting, saying, "The Shanghai garrison deployment plan was drafted in 1931 and revised in 1934. Since the Shanghai environment has changed, this plan should be revised. The garrison plan was established to prevent the Chinese side from invading the concessions. Now that this threat has been removed by the Japanese military, we should discuss and revise the plan." As for how it would be adjusted thereafter, the Japanese side did not immediately propose it at the time, but asked the commanders of the various countries to offer suggestions. However, the representatives made no indication. The Japanese military then announced a recess. After a while, the meeting was reconvened, and the representatives still made no suggestions. However, the British military leader acknowledged that it was possible to revise the garrison plan and announced the closure of the meeting. During the recess, the leaders of the British, American, and Italian garrisons exchanged opinions and agreed that the military staff of each country should meet to discuss and find a solution to revise the garrison plan. The date of the first meeting of the joint staff meeting has not yet been decided. The Japanese military, upon hearing the news, requested to participate in the meeting for open discussion. The foreign military leaders indicated that they would continue to discuss with the Japanese side after the military staff of each country had agreed on a plan.

Hepner's Arrival in Shanghai Attracts Attention

Admiral Hepner, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Asiatic Fleet, had only recently returned to Qingdao from Shanghai when he suddenly boarded the fast ship USS Isabel yesterday and rushed to Shanghai, scheduled to arrive today. This unexpected move has attracted considerable attention. Admiral Hepner was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the flagship USS Augusta at the end of this month. He received a telegram from Shanghai, hence this trip.

No Progress in Shanghai West Negotiations

According to reliable sources, negotiations between the Japanese Municipal Council and the Japanese Consulate regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries are ongoing, but with no progress. It is reported that one party to the negotiations is the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, and the other party is the Japanese Consulate. The content of the negotiations is being strictly guarded as a secret, and no release is allowed for the time being. SMC Chairman Fankling returned to Shanghai from Beidaihe yesterday morning and immediately went to the SMC to resume work, presumably because the serious situation in Shanghai requires his urgent return to preside over the response.

Britain and the United States Closely Cooperate to Respond

According to a business leader familiar with the situation of the SMC, who met with a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency yesterday, the focus of the concession issue is now on the United States. With Britain and France occupied with affairs in Europe, the United States has control of the decision-making power regarding the status of the Shanghai concessions. Its every move can truly influence everything. At a time when the Japanese military has begun to attack the concessions with force, US President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull issued statements at a reception for reporters, "Opposing any attempt to change the situation in the Far East by force." The implications are self-evident. It is now known that the consuls of Britain and the United States are maintaining close contact and have had repeated meetings regarding the negotiations over road construction beyond the boundaries, proving that the authorities of the two countries in Shanghai are determined to cooperate and respond to this situation. Most reprehensibly, the negotiations on this issue of road construction beyond the boundaries have historically been very complicated. When Wu Tiecheng was mayor, his secretary-general Yu Hongjun and former SMC director-general Feixindun repeatedly resolved the results of the negotiations, which were on the verge of resolution. For example, the police power and taxes of road construction beyond the boundaries had already been formulated with specific measures. However, due to the lack of sincerity of the SMC, our side failed. In the past, the SMC delayed in handing over the police power of road construction beyond the boundaries to the Chinese government. Now, it has begun negotiations with the Japanese side, intending to make concessions to a puppet government that has not been recognized by the world. I fear that this will add another stain to the history of British diplomacy.

Situation in Shanghai West is Tense and Relaxed by Turns

A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency patrolled the Shanghai West area again last night. The details are recorded below.

Replenishment of Defense Has Never Been Interfered With

The giant building at No. 448 Haig Road (west end of Difeng Road), after being occupied by Japanese military police and puppet police on the 13th, the family of the owner, Mr. Lin, had completely moved out yesterday. Four puppet police are still stationed in front of the main gate, and another door has been opened to the west of the main gate, which is wider than the original main gate. More than ten Japanese and puppet police are now working hard to build it. It is speculated that its purpose is to provide a watchtower for the Japanese military police. Regarding this action by the Japanese and puppet police, the police department has not been heard of any response measures.

Japanese Officers Occupy Civilian Houses

At the No. 31 Reception Center of the Cilian Branch at No. 11 Jessfield Road, four puppet police were still stationed in front, and most of the Japanese and puppet police stationed inside were transferred elsewhere yesterday, leaving only ten people. Yesterday at noon, a Japanese officer opened the room of the director of the reception center without permission and had a meal in the room. At that time, the wife of the director came from outside and suspected that a refugee on duty had opened it without permission, and scolded her face to face. The sound was heard by the Japanese officer, who was immediately furious and planned to drive out the director and others. Negotiations are currently underway.

British Soldiers on Guard on Yu Garden Road

Six puppet police are still stationed in front of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank staff dormitory at No. 1760 Jing An Temple Road. The Japanese military police and puppet police coming and going are still frequent, but there is no change. At Siming Villa, Zhongshi New Village, and Qianjia Lane opposite Yuguang Village on Yu Garden Road, there are two puppet police stationed at the entrances, and the situation is the same as the day before. Near Zhaofeng Park, plainclothes puppet police occasionally inquire about the names and populations of residents, but no other unfortunate incidents have occurred. Two British soldiers with guns are stationed in front of the giant building at No. 769, which attracts the attention of pedestrians.

Part of the Puppet Police Has Been Withdrawn

Puppet police are still stationed at the intersection of Kangjiaqiao and Jinjia Lane. However, the puppet police stationed in the area of Kangjiaqiao Jinsitu Temple have been withdrawn. The fortress in front of the west district command of the Japanese military police at Malu Bridge (intersection of Kena Road) is still under construction yesterday. The sandbags in front of the puppet police branch were being rebuilt yesterday, and a awning was added on top.

Setting Up Telephones, Armed Patrols

In the Caojiadu area, along Robinson Road, Japanese engineers were busy setting up military telephones on existing telephone poles from military trucks. The Japanese military police and puppet police were also frequently traveling back and forth on military trucks. Armed puppet police were still patrolling in formation on various roads, but the freedom of residents has not been violated yet.

### Japan Attributes All Actions to "Self-Defense," Claims Every Treaty Includes Self-Defense, Disregards US Statement

The Continental Daily News reported that when the Japanese side entertained reporters yesterday (the 13th), one asked whether there were any indications that Japan would take the self-defense measures it was requesting in the Nine-Power Treaty. A spokesman for the Japanese embassy replied that this depended on future developments.

Inability to Predict Future Events

The spokesman went on to say, regarding US Secretary of State Hull's statement that the United States would oppose any unilateral attempt to use force to eliminate American rights in China and the Far East, that it was not possible to say at this time what events would occur here in the future. This issue involves international law, but every treaty contains the right of all parties to take self-defense measures.

Disregards Hull's Statement

The "Manchurian Incident" was a prominent example of Japan invoking this right, as is the current Chinese "Incident." The Japanese authorities are now disregarding Hull's statement because the United States has held this attitude since the "Manchurian Incident." The United States' non-recognition of "Manchukuo" is in accordance with its position of not recognizing the unilateral use of force by other countries to change any treaty. The right of self-defense is recognized by leading American jurists in general, such as Supreme Court Chief Justice Hughes, who believes that the right of self-defense is "stronger than the treaty itself."

Vague About Tense Situation

One questioner asked whether the Japanese side felt there was any reason for the United States to reiterate its previous statement at this time. The embassy spokesman replied that the US authorities may believe that the general situation in Shanghai and the Far East is very tense. One questioner asked whether the spokesman also believed that the situation in Shanghai was "very tense." The spokesman gave a vague answer, saying that it was purely a matter of degree, and that opinions differed on the degree of tension.

Japanese Policy of Individual Negotiations

Regarding the use of the term "unilateral," the spokesman said that the Japanese government has a firm policy of not engaging in discussions or negotiations with other countries to resolve various issues related to China. For example, the Tianjin issue was discussed only between Britain and Japan because it involved Britain. The Japanese government adheres strictly to the policy of discussing only with the British those issues that concern them. The spokesman reiterated the Nine-Power Treaty, emphasizing that the meaning of the right of self-defense is not to eliminate, but to amend. The Kellogg-Briand Pact stipulates that the relevant countries have the right of self-defense. Japan's resort to "self-defense measures" does not conflict with the Pact.

### German Merchants Not Discriminated Against

Due to the outbreak of the European Second War, the ships of the German Rickmers Line's Shanghai branch, which traveled between Germany and the Far East, were completely suspended, and business plummeted. Coupled with the high rent in Shanghai, the company moved yesterday from its original location at No. 9 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession to No. 620 in the International Settlement in order to reduce its scope and save expenses. It was rumored that the company's decision to move was due to friendly advice from the French Concession authorities. The German Consulate General declared to a Da Zhong News Agency reporter yesterday that this statement was not true and that the French Concession authorities had never advised German merchants to move out of the French Concession.

### The Smokestacks of Warring Nations' Ships Repainted Black

Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the ships of the warring nations have been under the command of their respective navies. The ships of the British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire in this city were once prevented from sailing by the navy but resumed operations the next day. However, the Chinese and English ship names and flags on both sides of the ships have been painted over. It has recently been reported that the smokestacks of Jardine Matheson's ships, which are red, have also been repainted black. The blue smokestacks of the Blue Funnel Line's ships will also be repainted black. The smokestacks of Butterfield & Swire's ships are black, so it is unknown whether they will be changed in the future.

### Financial Circles Await Orders to Commence Construction of National Savings Bonds, Encouraging National Thrift, Government Guarantees Principal and Interest

Following the Ministry of Finance's promulgation of the Outline of Measures for Consolidating Finance, it stipulated that banks should be urged to actively handle savings deposits in accordance with laws and regulations, and invest their savings in productive enterprises. In addition, it promulgated the Regulations on National Savings Bonds for Promoting Thrift, designating the Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau to issue them in two types, A and B.

Type A is purchased by saving the face amount, and interest and dividends are given at maturity. Type B pays interest in advance upon purchase of the savings bonds, and the face amount is paid at maturity. The savings bonds are divided into six denominations: five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan, and are available in both registered and bearer forms.

The weekly interest rate is 6 to 6.5 percent. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired yesterday at the Shanghai branches of the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau of the Central Trust Bureau, etc. regarding the commencement of the construction of national savings bonds. They will proceed in accordance with the orders from the head office/bureau, etc. The accounting of their issuing banks/bureaus is independent, and in addition to the assets invested in savings deposits as the first

guarantee reserve and being directly responsible to the depositors by the issuing banks/bureaus, the safety of their principal and interest is guaranteed by the government. The use of the savings deposits will be in: (1) productive enterprises related to national defense; (2) land reclamation and construction of water conservancy to develop agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry; (3) development of industry and mining; (4) transportation undertakings; (5) joint production and marketing undertakings; (6) other construction undertakings related to the economy. The investment in each of the aforementioned undertakings must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval.

### The General Association of Charity Unions Will Soon Close Down, The Number of Refugees the Difficult Shelter Can Hold is Full, Further Measures Will Be Considered After Building New Houses

The United Relief Association of Charitable Organizations for Disaster Relief Committee for Refugees in War Zones (hereinafter referred to as the General Association of Charity Unions), located within the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road in this city, was established during the August 13th Shanghai Battle and has been in existence for over two years. At its peak, the association housed over 100,000 male and female refugees, with over 60 shelters. Recently, the number of refugees has gradually decreased, and the shelters have been making every effort to merge and close down. Currently, there are only 14 shelters, housing a total of 18,711 refugees. Recently, due to various reasons, there have been reports that the association will soon close down. A "Liquidation Committee" has been established and is currently meticulously discussing the resettlement of these more than 10,000 refugees. Once a proper solution is found, the General Association of Charity Unions will be closed down. In addition, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has announced that all shelters are full of refugees and, in addition to finding new empty land to build houses, has specifically notified various charitable organizations that they will stop accepting refugees from today. Further arrangements for accommodating refugees will be considered after the houses are built.

### A Hurricane Has Arisen Again in the Pacific Ocean, It is Still Far from Shanghai and Its Course is Unclear, The Huangpu River Will Experience High Tides Starting Today

According to news from the Observatory, a new hurricane has formed over the Pacific Ocean. However, it is currently far from Shanghai, so its direction and trajectory are unknown. In addition, the Huangpu River experienced a high tide at midnight this morning, and there will be another high tide this afternoon, which will continue until the 20th before returning to normal. During the high tide period, shops and businesses in low-lying roads must not relax their flood prevention efforts to avoid losses.

### The Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Bowen, Denies the Allegation of Exclusively Employing Japanese, Anyone with Competence Can Fill Important Positions, The Nationality of the Person is Not Considered

The Continental News reports that the Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Bowen, denied yesterday (the 13th) that he had said he intended to recruit "capable Japanese" to fill vacancies left by the British and did not intend to hire people from other countries, as reported by the Japanese "Continental News." However, he stated that the rest of the report was true. According to the "Continental News," a reporter from the newspaper visited Bowen on Tuesday and asked about the British and Japanese police officers in the police department. Bowen replied that there was no deliberate discrimination against the Japanese. Anyone with the ability to properly perform the duties of the position can fill important positions, regardless of the person's nationality.

The Police Department Follows the Board's Opinion

Regarding the regulation that allows British police to use hand-held machine guns but prohibits Japanese police from using them, he believes that it is not discrimination, but a matter of procedure. It is now planned to train Japanese police to use these weapons. The reporter asked about the attitude of the "Municipal Government" towards the request to manage roads outside the Settlement. Bowen said that this issue is very important and he cannot answer immediately. The attitude of the Police Department will depend on the decision of the Shanghai Municipal Council, not on his personal opinion. The Police Department will follow the policy determined by the Shanghai Municipal Council and is responsible for maintaining the policing power of the roads outside the Western District.

Hope for Cooperation from the Japanese

Bowen also stated that he knew nothing about the maintenance costs of the four-line isolated army in the detention camp of the Public Concession, or the seizure of German property in the Public Concession by the British authorities. The peace and order of the Public Concession should be maintained, which is the common responsibility of all countries that make up the Concession. In view of the current "dark situation" in Europe, he hopes that the Japanese will actively cooperate to maintain the peace and order of the Public Concession. No friction has been found between the British and Japanese in the Shanghai Municipal Council, and everything seems to be proceeding smoothly. He also hopes that the British and Japanese will cooperate with each other on issues that affect the general problems of the Public Concession.

### Although the War Has Begun in Europe, Donations for China Relief Have Not Decreased, It is Expected that Various Countries Will Donate Enthusiastically Next Month, Flood Victims in Various Places Urgently Need Assistance

The Continental News reports that a reporter met yesterday (the 13th) with several people who have been engaged in relief work for a long time. According to their views, although the war has begun in Europe, it is still expected that various countries will continue to provide economic assistance in the middle of next month to carry out relief work throughout China. They do not believe that the relief funds donated will be reduced because of the resumption of war in Europe. It is reported that several groups are now redoubling their efforts to raise funds to pay for relief work in China. One of these groups is the American Church Committee, which raised more than US$250,000 for relief funds in China last year and is currently conducting a fundraising campaign for US$1 million to be used for relief next year. According to a member of the American Relief Fund Committee in China, even funds from the United Kingdom will not be completely stopped. According to the committee's recent communication with the British office, the council believes that the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations can be expected to continue to donate

However, the amount must be smaller than last year. According to the British relief fund donations, the Mayor of London initiated the fund, originally named the London Mayor's Fund. Later, the scope of the group was greatly expanded and received donations for relief funds in China throughout the United Kingdom. Canada and Australia are major donors in the British Commonwealth of Nations. According to well-informed sources, the two Commonwealth of Nations will continue to work hard to raise relief funds in China. The only foreign relief group here that will end its affairs in a month or two is the American Relief Civilian Committee in China organized under the auspices of the American Red Cross. Yesterday, a senior member of the committee stated that the US$200,000 sent by the American Red Cross will soon be exhausted. It is expected that the American Red Cross will not re-allocate funds here. According to a relief worker, a large amount of funds will be needed this year. There are floods in North China, one-third of Hebei Province,

and 12 million people who have become impoverished and in urgent need of relief. As winter approaches, the Yellow River will continue to flow south from the breach. It is expected that the areas most affected will be the Huai River basin in Anhui and northern Jiangsu. In addition, there are millions of people who have become impoverished due to the war. If the Japanese army launches a large-scale invasion in October, the number of displaced people will inevitably increase greatly. The American Church Committee is now handling relief matters and is most satisfactory. Most of the relief funds are raised in the United States.

### The Rice Merchants' Association Decides to Start Selling Rice at Controlled Prices Tomorrow, The Specified Time Will Last Until All Rice is Sold, Preparations at Five Locations in the Two Concessions Have Been Completed

After more than 18,000 bags of foreign rice ordered from Saigon by various groups such as Yu Qiaqing arrived in Shanghai, 10,000 bags were used to relieve refugees and 8,000 bags were used for selling rice at controlled prices. The Rice Merchants' Association was entrusted with the handling of the sale of rice at controlled prices. After the association appointed personnel to each of the locations for selling rice at controlled prices, all preparations have now been completed. A meeting of the committees for selling rice at controlled prices was specially convened at 3:00 pm yesterday, attended by Zhang Nianxuan, Pan Jibin, Lu Wenshao, Qu Zhenhua, Shi Hongxun, Cheng Bingzhang, Huang Ruyuan, Ge Peiyuan, Chen Shaolian, Xia Tongfu, Su Boxun, Jiang Qiusheng, etc. Zhang Nianxuan chaired the meeting, reported on the preparations in each location, and decided to start selling rice at controlled prices from the 16th of this month. The time is from 8:00 am to 11:00 am and 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm every day, until all 8,000 bags are sold. All measures will be handled in accordance with the agreement previously reached with Yu Qiaqing. In addition, it was decided that the meals of the personnel selling rice at controlled prices and all necessary documents during the period of selling rice at controlled prices will be announced by the association today so that the public is aware of them. It is also heard that the total number of foreign rice ordered by the group has reached 12,000 bags as of yesterday. It is scheduled that the initiators, Yu Qiaqing, etc., will convene a meeting of all those who ordered the rice this week to discuss the ordering method, and there is also a proposal to request more foreign exchange to expand the scope of selling rice at controlled prices.

### Raw Materials for People's Livelihood and Daily Use and Industry are Specially Allowed to be Imported and Transshipped, Special Permits Must Be Obtained, Divided into Special Use and Commercial Sale, Goods Ordered in the Past and in Transit Are Also Permitted

After the promulgation of the Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Periods, 234 tariff rules, such as luxuries and non-essential goods, are uniformly prohibited from import or transshipment. As for the articles for the people's livelihood and daily use or raw materials belonging to the industry, it is allowed to apply to the Ministry for a special permit to allow import and transshipment. The details are as follows:

The Ministry Orders Special Permission to Import and Transship

The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Director-General of Customs, stating that if the foreign goods that have been embargoed were indeed ordered or shipped before the promulgation of the embargo order, or the goods transshipped are articles for the people's livelihood and daily use or raw materials belonging to the industry, which are needed in various parts of the rear, and the foreign exchange has been raised for the prices of the goods, it may be allowed to submit documents to the Ministry in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Measures for Applying for Import Permits for Items Prohibited from Import during Extraordinary Periods and to apply to the Ministry for the issuance of import permits to report and transport the goods for import. If the transported goods cannot be submitted for inspection of the import permit, they should still be prohibited from import. The customs offices in various places have been ordered to comply.

Regulations on Applying for a Special Permit

Divided into two types: special-use permits and commercial sale permits. (1) Special-use regulations: For government agencies to regulate the market prices in the rear, they must purchase or entrust businesses to purchase certain embargoed items on their behalf. Government agencies, private organizations, and individuals have a real need for embargoed items for scientific, industrial, medical, health, charitable relief, educational, and cultural purposes. (2) Commercial sale regulations: Sugar, kerosene, gasoline, etc. The purchaser should first clearly state the type, name, brand, and country of import and quantity of the goods to be transported. After the Ministry has reviewed and approved them, a special permit will be issued.

### Unified Class C Public Bonds, Regular Lottery Draw, Bonds Due at the End of the Month Will Be Paid, However, the Telegraph Administration Public Bond May Be Delayed

The public bonds due at the end of September include, in addition to the Jin Chang type, which the Four Banks have agreed to discount, and Shanghai will pay in six installments of remittance bills. (1) The 24th Year of the Republic of China Telegraph Administration Public Bond, issued in October of the 24th year, with a fixed amount of 10 million yuan in national currency. This will be repaid 400,000 yuan in 16 installments. (2) The Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bond, issued in October of the 25th year, with a fixed amount of 12 million yuan in national currency. This will be repaid 2.4 million yuan in 6 installments. (3) The Guangdong-Hong Kong River Dredging Project US Dollar Public Bond, issued in April of the 16th year, with a fixed amount of US$2 million. This will be repaid US$40,000 in 5 installments. The above three types of payment methods will be announced by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications. It is heard that the Telegraph Administration may be delayed. As for the public bond to be drawn for repayment of principal at 10:00 am on October 9th, it is the Unified Class C Bond of the 25th year of the Republic of China, with 8 draws totaling 2.8 million yuan for repayment of principal. The payment date is January 31st of next year. As for the Shanghai Coupon Market (i.e., the black market), because the government's maintenance of bond credibility has remained unchanged, it has gained the trust of bondholders. Therefore, the purchase is booming, and the prices of unified bonds are becoming more stable, with ups and downs of only 5 cents to several corners.

### British Warship Intercepts a Japanese Ship, The Japanese Side Expresses, No Intention to File a Protest

The Shanghai Times reports that when the Japanese side entertained reporters yesterday (the 13th), or asked about the reported interception of a Japanese ship by a British warship near Taiwan, the Japanese authorities had already filed a protest with the United Kingdom. A Japanese naval spokesman replied that warships of belligerent countries have the right to intercept ships of neutral countries on the high seas during wartime. The Japanese side has never and does not intend to file a protest. Since the United Kingdom has declared war, Japan recognizes the right of the United Kingdom to intercept ships of neutral countries on the high seas and search for contraband in accordance with international law. However, considering that the place where the Japanese ship was intercepted is very close to Taiwan, and there are no German territories or ports nearby, British warships may not have a great necessity to exercise their rights.

### The Fake Side's Tax Revenue, Friction is Increasing, The "New Government" Does Not Cooperate

Since Shao Shijun was appointed as the "Director of the Three Provinces Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui" under the control of the Japanese side, he has extorted various taxes, and the amount is very large. The "New Government" believes that the bureau is not subject to the control of the "Ministry of Finance" and has been unusually wrangling against it. In recent months, the friction between the two sides has been increasing. According to a certain source obtained by the reporter, the "New Government" has now decided to adopt a non-cooperative approach and regards all "branches" set up by the "Tax Bureau" in various places as illegal, saying that they have not been approved by the "New Government." On the one hand, it also ordered the people not to pay taxes to the "branches" set up by the "Tax Bureau." If they pay taxes, they will be punished. Therefore, the merchants and people in the inland are at a loss for a while and do not know what to do.

### Cases of True Cholera are Gradually Decreasing

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently reported that according to a report from the Chief of the Health Department, the average number of cases of true cholera in the Concession is three per day in a certain week, which should be considered an epidemic. The above average number of cases is consistent with the standards set by the Concession, but in terms of the number of residents in the Concession, it can be said that the number is not large, and the reported number of daily occurrences has in fact gradually decreased. From this, it can be seen that the cholera situation this year is still mild and has only just reached the level of an epidemic.

### British Ships Transport Grain to Tianjin, The Water in Tianjin Dries Up and There is Panic About Food, Special Transportation of Flour and Miscellaneous Grains for Relief

Tianjin is the center of the Northern Ocean route and the commercial center of North China, so the business communities of various countries attach great importance to it. Since the "July 7th Incident", the business of foreign businessmen in North China has been greatly affected, and shipping has also been hit. In July of this year, the British Concession in Tianjin was blockaded by the Japanese army, causing British ships to be unable to transport goods to Tianjin. Later, it was slightly eased, and suddenly there was a major flood, and shipping was suspended. It has been nearly a month. It is heard that the water level has slightly receded recently, but there is extreme panic about food there. Today, a British ship went to Tianjin, transporting more than 16,000 bags of flour and more than 4,000 bags of miscellaneous grains such as beans, which is the first shipment of goods to Tianjin by a British ship after the flood.

### Italian Postal Service Ship Seeking Profits and Raising Firewood, No Longer Coming to Shanghai, Conte Biancamano is Scheduled to Return to Europe on the 24th

The Italian Postal Service ship Giulio Cesare has been in Shanghai for half a month and started to raise anchor and return to Europe yesterday morning. The ship originally came to Shanghai this time to replace the Conte Rosso's schedule, so it will not come again next time. In addition, the company's Conte Biancamano came to Shanghai from Genoa on the 12th of this month and docked at the Gonghexiang Pier in Hongkou. Passengers and cargo have been unloaded. According to the schedule, it should have returned to Europe yesterday. Since yesterday's schedule has been operated by the Giulio Cesare to return to Europe, the ship must be slightly delayed in Shanghai. This morning, it sailed to the Wusongkou for temporary anchorage, and it will return to the pier on the 21st to load cargo, and is scheduled to depart for Europe on the 24th.

### Various Factories and Groups Send Wang Gongquan to Nanyang

Since the outbreak of the European War, the source of imported goods has been scarce, and it is the time for the development of the national goods industry.

He set off on the Chinina Mail ship yesterday (14th). Wang Gongquan is the assistant manager of Tianxiang Yubao Factory and is a well-known figure in the national goods industry.

### The Achievements of the Special Service Brigade of the Wuxi West District Self-Defense Force

According to a visitor from Wuxi, Zhou Hanliang, the captain of the special service brigade of the Wuxi West District Self-Defense Force, gathered strong men and organized a people's self-defense force since the fall of Wuxi. The authorities specially appointed him as the captain of the brigade. Zhou deeply believes that the responsibility is great and there is no complacency in his mind. A Japanese envoy named Hu Jugen, led the Japanese army to Bai Village in April and May to spy on the Chinese military situation. As a result, three of Zhou's friends were killed and seven were captured alive. However, Hu was still not satisfied and recently went to Bridge to inquire about Zhou's whereabouts, but did not gain anything. Later, Zhou heard about it and was very angry. On the night of "August 13th," he led his team to Beicang to take over the Tingxinji opium den. Hu was playing the Xiao and stopped the drinking. Zhou then ordered to fire and killed Hu. Also last month, Zhou led his team to attack the Japanese troops in Luoshe. Seven Japanese soldiers were killed and two were injured. Zhou's side sacrificed team members Ma Tianxiang and Wang Wenzhong, and injured Han Qingshan. Recently, Zhou joined forces with the regular army of the 52nd Division and destroyed four or five miles of highway near Meiyuan. In addition, Jiang Liuchun, the pseudo-district chief of Kaiyuan Township, illegally organized a district office, relied on his power to bully others, forcibly issued more than 20,000 good citizen certificates, and levied a strong field tax with cruel means, causing the people to live in misery. Zhou heard about it and sent a team to arrest him. It was originally intended to escort him to the higher authorities, but Jiang thought he had no face to see anyone and committed suicide by drowning himself in a water tank. Also last month, the Huazhong Company organized by the Japanese and puppets transported a boat of silkworm cocoons, worth 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. On the way through Shuanghe, it happened that Inspector Cao was sent by the higher authorities to track down and went to Zhou's team to burn them all. Zhou has recently been encouraging his troops to attack and control the city at any time.

### The Zhenjiang Association Opposes the Construction of Houses for Rent at the Yizhong Cemetery

The Lüban Road Jingjiang Association's Tuyang Yizhong Cemetery in the French Concession has more than seven acres of land. Recently, the association suddenly engaged in picking up bones and reburying them, intending to build houses for rent. The Zhenjiang Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the association and related groups yesterday, expressing its opposition and suggesting that it be rebuilt into schools or hospitals and other public welfare undertakings. The original letter is as follows: "Dear Sir/Madam, After investigation, the Tuyang Yizhong Cemetery on Lüban Road in the French Concession has more than seven acres of land. After several disputes, it has been barren for a long time and it is a pity to abandon it. Those who know it are sick of it. Fortunately, the elders have spared no great effort to rectify it, pick up bones and rebury them, and gradually become clear. The construction of houses and the handling of public undertakings are actively underway. I admire the elders' enthusiasm for public welfare and benefiting the villagers. However, it was recently heard that someone suggested that the base be used to build houses for rent to generate profits. The news came as a surprise. Tuyang Yizhong was originally established by the sages of our village for the public welfare of the villagers in Shanghai and has been in existence for decades. Now that we are using this barren base to relocate the old tomb, it still seems appropriate to carry out public welfare undertakings, which is not only worthy of the dead, but also benefits the living, and is particularly important and in line with the spirit of the sages who established the Yizhong in the past. However, there are thousands of public welfare undertakings, and we have to distinguish between priorities. I think that the most urgent needs at present are two, and I will briefly describe them as follows. Please take note of them: (1) Since our village fell two years ago, no less than hundreds of thousands of villagers have come to Shanghai to seek refuge. The education of our villagers' children cannot be solved due to economic limitations. The number of out-of-school youths is large. If this continues, it will not only be a loss to our village, but also a great hidden worry to the country. Therefore, it is an urgent task to set up schools to educate the children of our villagers. Now that the elders have moved the Yizhong Cemetery, how about using the base to build a school to accommodate out-of-school youths from our village free of charge? Moreover, raising children and teaching them is the most important task at present, and cultivating talents is also a happy event in the world. The elders support education and love the youth, and I am sure they will be happy to agree with this proposal. This is the first. (2) There are many hospitals in Shanghai, but most of them are commercial in nature, and ordinary people often cannot get their benefits. Among the villagers in Shanghai, there are more small and medium-sized villagers than other籍, and I often see them concealing their illnesses and refusing to seek medical treatment, which eventually leads to major problems that cannot be cured. The reason for this is that medical treatment in Shanghai is expensive, and it costs several yuan at a time. Ordinary people are struggling to make a living, let alone seek medical treatment. It is estimated that countless people have died because of this, and it is a pity to let them die. If we can use the Yizhong Cemetery's base to build a large-scale hospital to provide free medical treatment for the poor villagers, then saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda, and benefiting the people is something that the elders are willing to advocate. This is the second. The above two items seem to be able to choose one to implement, so that all villagers in Shanghai can benefit from it. As for the expenses for opening and construction, although the amount is large, the Zhenjiang groups in Shanghai can be responsible for raising funds, so that everyone can work together to achieve success as soon as possible. Moreover, after checking, this place has always been the land of the Yizhong Cemetery for many years. If it is now rebuilt into houses, I am afraid it is not appropriate. It is better to use it to build public buildings such as schools or hospitals, which seems to be more appropriate. Moreover, building houses for rent is no different from profit-making, and I am afraid it will repeat the mistakes of the Jingjiang Association in the past, which I think will not be adopted by the wise elders. If this happens unfortunately, our association will not dare to agree for the sake of the villagers' interests and will be in an opposing position. I am sincerely worried, and I offer my humble opinion in the hope that it will be adopted and implemented. I look forward to it very much."

### New Development of Mardi Motor Company, New Repair Station and Showroom Open

The American-owned Mardi Motor Company, in order to improve service efficiency, has added the Packard and Flier automobile repair station and showroom at 640 Foch Road, which has now been completed and opened today. Mr. Mardi, the general manager of the company, expressed his feelings, saying that the Mardi Motor Company, relying on the cooperation of his colleagues, has developed from a small-scale company to an automobile company with a sound organization and the best service efficiency after 19 years of hard work.

However, what is unique is the new repair station. Its scale and equipment are not only the best in Shanghai, but also comparable to those in the United States. The latest testing and repair machines and high-pressure lubrication machines, etc., are amazing in their ingenuity. Mr. Mardi is also proud of this, and said that all human errors can be avoided in the future. In the past, testing and repair were based on guesswork or experimentation. Now, the most sophisticated machines are available, based entirely on science, so the work is better, the time is shorter, and it is more economical. The company's Chrysler and Windmill showroom is located at the corner of Sichuan Road and Edward Road, the repair station is located at 408 Pushi Road, and there is also an assembly yard at 115 Daxi Road.

### Pseudo Commander-in-Chief Han Jun Shot and Fled, Two Suspects Arrested, Gunman Still at Large

Han Jun, a Shandong native currently stationed in Caohejing Town, Xuhui, as the "Police Brigade" Commander-in-Chief of the so-called "Shanghai Special Municipality," is 53 years old. Originally from the military, on June 22nd of this year, he took his beloved concubine, a woman from Yangzhou, and rented apartment number 39 in the Lushan Apartments at number 7, Lane 313, San Yi Li, Julai Road, French Concession (east of Rue de Sainte-Marie). Han used the pseudonym Zhang Yuntao, registering it in the apartment's circular register and guest card, and has been staying there for over two months. He travels by car daily, and has many visitors. However, the other residents of the apartment were unaware of Han's status as a rising star, and mostly paid him no attention. Yesterday, at 11:15 AM, Han, wearing a gray silk long gown, left the apartment with two friends, walked out of San Yi Li Lane, and arrived in front of the Yuan Chang Porcelain Shop at number 210 across the street. As he was about to step into the car parked there, a man wearing a white undershirt and black silk pants suddenly rushed out from the roadside and shot at Han with a pistol, firing four shots in quick succession. Several other people were acting as lookouts. Han was shot twice in the back, on the left and right sides, but still managed to escape into the car. His chauffeur drove off at full speed, heading west. The San Yi Li gatekeeper, hearing the gunshots and seeing what had happened, immediately blew his whistle to summon the patrolmen. However, the gunman and the lookouts fled in different directions, east and west, amidst the whistle blasts. Several patrolmen bravely gave chase in both directions. At the corner of Avenue Albert, the gunman managed to escape, but two suspects were apprehended. One of them had been shot in the shoulder. They were taken back to the police station for questioning. Han's concubine, who was staying in the Lushan Apartments, disappeared after the incident. The police sent detectives to guard the apartment. After a while, Wang Jun (44 years old), a Jiangbei native who claimed to be Han's adjutant, arrived, unaware of what had happened. He addressed Han as Commander-in-Chief, and was subsequently taken to the police station by the detectives for questioning. Because the victim had disappeared, the French police contacted all hospitals, but found no trace of him. It is rumored that Han, badly wounded, sought treatment at a Hongkou hospital. The French police are currently sending detectives out to investigate the cause of the shooting and to apprehend the perpetrators for interrogation.

### Morphine Den Uncovered

The detective chief of the Xinzha police station recently received a tip that a morphine trafficking operation was being conducted at number 45, Meixingli, Lane 714, Jinjiazhai, Chengdu Road, selling heroin and other drugs. Yesterday (the 14th) at 4:30 PM, he secretly dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They apprehended a Mai woman selling morphine and a buyer in the stove room of the house, and also found a large bag of morphine. They were all taken to the police station for detention and interrogation.

### Morphine Criminal Sentenced

Xin Yujing and Li Guoxing from Shandong recently engaged in secret morphine injections for profit at number 20, Yuanfangli, East Broadway Road. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month at 6:00 PM, detectives from the Huishan police station discovered this and arrested Xin and Li at the address. They were quickly sent to the First Special District Court along with 36 small packets of morphine. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the trial yesterday morning and sentenced Xin Yujing and Li Guoxing to twelve years of imprisonment each, and the drugs were confiscated.

### Prostitute Sold into Bondage, Pimp Organized Gang Kidnapping, Pimp and Accomplices Arrested After Reporting to Police

Li Fengying, a woman from Taizhou, is currently 20 years old. In May of this year, she was sold for 150 yuan into a brothel run by Xu Yan, a woman from Taizhou, at number 38, Siming Inn, West Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, to work as a prostitute for a term of two years, with a contract signed. From then on, Li fell into the abyss. Every night, Xu Yan would send her to the Great World amusement park to solicit customers. However, a Shaoxing man named Shi Chengrong, who worked as a tea server foreman on the eighth floor of the Great New Company rooftop garden, frequented Xu Yan's establishment and became acquainted with Li Fengying. They fell in love at first sight and promised to marry each other. They then discussed a plan to redeem her. On the 5th of this month, Shi paid 150 yuan to Xu Yan to redeem Li and they moved into a rented house to live together. At around 9:00 PM the night before last, Shi, Li, and a woman named Sun Wang went to the Mingxing Theater on Park Road and Qingdao Road to watch a movie. Upon exiting, they were suddenly ambushed by Xu Yan and a dozen others, who had hired a car to wait. As soon as Li Fengying appeared, they rushed forward, snatched Li onto the car, and sped away. Shi reported this to the Xinzha police station, who dispatched detective Yang Peizhang, together with detectives from the French police, to number 38, Siming Inn, where they arrested Xu Yan and found Li Fengying in room 54 upstairs. They were all taken to the police station. Subsequently, Yang Axiang, a Suzhou native, was arrested at number 123, Shanhai Pass Road. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit according to the law, stating that accomplices Bao Tingyu and others were still at large and requesting a postponement. After a brief interrogation of Li Fengying and the defendants Xu Yan and Yang Axiang, the presiding judge ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.

### Case Continued for Further Review: Bicycle Shop Owner Rapes Young Girl, Shameless Couple Arrested

Lu He, a young woman from Jiangbei (17 years old), residing in room number 8, number 93, Lane 1173, Seymour Road, had a relationship with Ji Xilin (29 years old), a Shanghai native who owned the Diefei Bicycle Shop at number 113, Route Cardinal Mercier. Despite already having a wife and children, Ji was still having an affair with Lu. Ji, known for his lustful nature, was not satisfied and asked Lu to find him a virgin to satisfy his desires. Lu's roommate, Ju Guangtao, a Yangzhou native, had a daughter named Xiuying, who was only 14 years old and had not yet experienced intimacy. On the afternoon of the 21st of last month at 8:00 PM, Lu lured Xiuying to room number 119, Andong Inn, number 131, Hubei Road, under the pretext of taking her out to play. Ji soon arrived and attempted to rape Xiuying, but because of her young age and incomplete development, Ji was unable to achieve his goal. However, Xiuying sustained injuries to her lower body. After being threatened by Lu and Ji, Xiuying did not dare to say anything when she returned home. It was not until the day before yesterday that her mother, Ju Chen, discovered bloodstains on her daughter's pants and questioned her. Xiuying finally revealed the truth. Ju Chen then confronted Lu and reported the incident to the Laozha police station. Detective Xue Youwen arrested Ji and sent Xiuying to the hospital. The examination confirmed that her lower body had been sexually assaulted three weeks prior. Yesterday morning, Ji and Lu were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed charges of rape under Article 231 of the Criminal Law. Judge Feng Shide announced that the hearing was closed to the public and ordered them to be detained for further investigation.

### Chen Weida's Home Robbed, Masked Robbers Identified by Maid, Shop Clerk from Broadway Mansions Arrested as Suspect

The home of Chen Weida, a wealthy Shanghai businessman and Catholic believer residing at number 13, Lane 170, Route Lafayette, was broken into by four robbers wearing visored caps on the morning of the 6th of this month at 7:30 AM. They stole cash and valuables worth over 1,000 yuan and fled the scene. Chen reported the incident to the police and requested an investigation. On the afternoon of the 12th at 5:00 PM, Chen's maid, Wang Abao, was out shopping and encountered Shao Zuoting (28 years old, short stature), a Ningbo native working as a shop clerk at number 11, Broadway Mansions, Broadway Road, at the tram stop at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Vegetable Market Road. She identified him as one of the robbers present at the scene. She cried for help, and Shao was arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court and requested to be detained for investigation and further questioning. Chen Weida, accompanied by his daughter Chen Bangqian (22 years old) and the maid Wang Abao, appeared in court. According to Wang, the first three robbers had already gone upstairs, and she could not clearly identify them. However, she was very clear about the defendant. "He pushed me into the young lady's room, pinned me to the bed, pressed a pillow over my face, and threatened me with a knife. At the time, he was wearing a visored cap," she stated. Shao Zuoting testified that he worked as a shop clerk at Broadway Mansions. That afternoon, he went to his relatives' house at number 5, San Yu Li, to see his wife. Because his wife was out and his relatives were women taking a bath, and the room was small and not suitable for waiting, he went outside and waited at the tram stop when he was identified as a robber. He claimed to be clueless and requested a thorough investigation. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Miao ordered a postponement until the 23rd for further questioning and ordered Shao to be detained.

### Bi Haomin Accused of Brandishing Gun to Intimidate Bank Employee Over Property Seizure

Zhang Lingyun (23 years old, Wuxian native), an employee of the Yongcheng Bank at number 241, Zhonghui Building, Avenue Edward VII, recently hired lawyer Sun Shi'an to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against Bi Haomin (29 years old, Zhejiang native), the younger brother of jockey Bi Haoqing of the Pao Ma Ting, who owns the Bide Xing Raincoat Company at number 35, Rue Lupan,

Accusing him of using a gun to intimidate and coerce him into performing an unlawful act, and requesting his arrest and prosecution. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff worked at the Yongcheng Bank in Zhonghui Building. On the 4th of this month, the bank filed a lawsuit to recover a debt, and the court ruled to seize the movable property in the house at number 1310, Ma Jili, owned by the debtor Mao Wenlong, for sale as collateral. However, at 2:00 PM that afternoon, a man claiming to be Li Linshu, accompanied by the defendant, arrived and claimed that the house had been leased from Mao by Li,

And should not be sealed. They demanded that it be unsealed immediately. The plaintiff asked where Mao Wenlong had moved to, but the defendant replied that he did not know, only the address of Zhang Yimei, the witness for the lease transfer. He demanded that the plaintiff go with him to inquire about Mao's address. However, after leaving the bank, the defendant forced the plaintiff into his car and drove him to the Tongren Law Firm on Beijing Road, where he took out blank legal papers and forced the plaintiff to sign an order to unseal the property. The plaintiff refused under the pretext of resisting, and returned to the bank. Shortly afterwards, the defendant brought Zhang Yimei to the bank, demanding that the property be unsealed immediately. The plaintiff explained that if the seizure was erroneous, there were legal remedies, and he could not rashly sign the unsealing order under duress. Upon hearing this, the defendant became enraged and, without regard for the circumstances, pulled out a pistol and aimed it at the plaintiff's chest, threatening to shoot him and kill him if he did not unseal the property immediately. Fortunately, Li Linshu and Zhu Huimin, an employee of the British Embassy, were present and, fearing a major incident, dragged the defendant out, preventing any harm from coming to the plaintiff. The defendant's act of using a gun to intimidate and force him to sign the unsealing order constitutes a violation of Articles 204 and 305 of the Criminal Law. The court accepted the lawsuit, and Judge Wu Kechou summoned him for questioning yesterday. After the plaintiff recounted the incident, the defendant hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Xiao Zichuan from the Tongren Law Firm to defend him. He testified that he had a gun, but did not take it out to intimidate the plaintiff. After reviewing the testimonies, the court ordered the defendant to post bail and postponed the hearing for further investigation.

### Yu Shunqing Commits Murder Out of Shame and Rage, Charged with Murder

Yu Shunqing, a 57-year-old Jiangbei man who runs a food stall at number 424, Haifang Road, is elderly and nearly blind, and prone to suspicion. His daughter-in-law is somewhat attractive and has a frivolous nature. She often flirts with Zhou Zhaifang, a Ningbo native who runs a steamed bun shop across from the tiger stove. Yu Shunqing mistakenly believed that they were having an affair and became extremely angry, wanting to take drastic action to quell the rage in his heart. At 4:30 AM the day before yesterday, taking advantage of Zhou's sound sleep, Yu Shunqing, wielding a kitchen knife, rushed into the steamed bun shop across the street and, without regard for the circumstances, attacked Zhou, mistakenly injuring his nephew Zhou Haosheng in the face. As a result, Zhaifang was also stabbed in the head and back, and cried for help. Detectives from the Gordon Road police station arrived after hearing the alarm, arrested Yu Shunqing, and took him and the kitchen knife to the police station for detention. The injured Zhou Zhaifang and his nephew Zhou Haosheng were taken to the Majiong Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the suspect Yu was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court.

Random Notes on Artists

### Film and Theater Impressions and More (Part 1)

— Recorded by Leng Fang

—As Told by Movie Star Lu Luming—

Editor's Note: Lu Luming is known as a "Fitness Star," and is dedicated to both stage and film arts, with many years of tireless effort, not favoring one over the other, a truly commendable dedication. In recent years, her fame has overflowed the art scene, gracing both the stage and screen, showing a clear and outstanding presence. Yet, she remains humble and eager to improve. With such a professional attitude, her future is undoubtedly limitless.

I am a deeply passionate lover of film and theater. Six years ago, I came to Shanghai from the North and entered the film and theater industry. Although I have acted in many stage plays and films, I still consider myself a small student. I work hard and carefully in my daily acting work, only aiming to improve. My sole purpose is to succeed in becoming a true actor.

Brief Personal History

My ancestral home is Guangdong Province, but... I grew up in Shenyang. My father was a construction engineer and was always working there, until I was nine years old, when we moved to Tianjin, where we lived for ten years. During this time, I studied for many years at a local church school called "Sacred Achievement." Unfortunately, my father passed away suddenly when I was fifteen years old, leaving behind my mother and me!

Past Experiences in Film

Thinking back on my past experiences in film, almost ten years have passed without realizing it. I remember that in 1930, the Lianhua Film Company opened its fifth branch in Beijing and was recruiting actors. At the time, I was filled with enthusiasm for film and went to apply. Fortunately, I was accepted and began studying at their training school. The director of the school was the senior dramatist Mr. Hou Yao. There were over a hundred male and female students, including Ms. Bai Yang (then known as Yang Junli), Ms. Liu Li, and Mr. Yin Xiucen (the fat one), all of whom were my classmates. The training period was set for six months. We had daily classes and also busily filmed a movie called "New Grievances in the Forbidden City" as a practical exercise. Now that I think about it, it's really funny. The movie had only outdoor scenes; there were no indoor scenes at all—because, apart from one camera, there was no other equipment. Every day, a group of us filmed on Longevity Hill under the scorching sun, applying thick makeup on our faces. Our skin was painfully sunburned. It was really pitiful. "Is this what making movies is like?" We had never even seen a studio or lighting. Everyone was just working hard without really understanding what was going on. Later, after the six-month training period ended, "New Grievances in the Forbidden City" was completed, and Lianhua's fifth branch was immediately closed down. It just dissipated like clouds and wind and disintegrated.

### Hukwang to Show "Aviation Hero"

— Another New Soviet Film

The veteran Soviet directors rarely release new works these days because they are taking on the task of training and guiding new directors. For example, we have rarely seen new works from Eisenstein, Pudovkin, etc. Even if they produce a new film, they will definitely use an assistant director to give the younger generation a chance to learn. Pudovkin's new work, "Aviation Hero," is being assisted by Torer.

The sequel to "Peter the Great," which was originally scheduled to be shown at Hukwang, has reportedly been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. Pudovkin's "Aviation Hero" will be shown first, starting on the 16th of this month. This film showcases the strength of the Soviet air force and the government's attention to the aviation industry.

Stalin and Molotov also play a role in this film. They are seen shaking hands with the aviation heroes at a welcome reception.

On the other hand, the theme of this film also illustrates that great achievements are made by ordinary people, and great people are nurtured by ordinary people.

Following "Sunrise," the Lafai Theater's "Wild" has also encountered special curfew regulations in the concession. Therefore, it plans to only show daytime performances starting on the 16th, with nighttime performances being suspended.

### Casual Sketches of the Entertainment World

— Written by Dong Yun, Illustrated by Xiu Yan

(15) Spoken Drama

The difference between spoken drama and Peking opera is like the difference between Western painting and traditional Chinese painting. Peking opera is about conveying the spirit, while spoken drama is closer to realism. In Peking opera, things like "Farewell to the Kiln," "Visiting the Prison," "Closing the Door," and "Riding a Horse" don't necessarily have to be real, but they must be expressed through gestures and movements. Spoken drama is not like that at all. It's a real performance, not a substitution. Therefore, when it comes to genuine and moving moments, Peking opera cannot compare to spoken drama.

The predecessor of spoken drama was "Civilized Drama."

Statement: This piece should have been switched with the "Civilized Drama" (16th) published on the 10th. Readers should take note.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Story of Wang Keqin's Separation and Reunion with Zhang Xun

Zhang Xun saw that his subordinates were so united, and that they couldn't bear to part with the long braid left over from the Qing Dynasty (all of Zhang's soldiers had long, loose braids, usually covered with black gauze), he knew that they were all expressing their sympathy with him. That's why he boldly dared to go north. But when he decided to lead the entire army away from Xuzhou, Zhang Wensheng was deeply afraid that his teacher would be deceived this time, so he advised him not to go, not to take risks. Who would have thought that the ill-fated Kang the Sage would persuade the Braided Marshal to be convinced, thinking that with such a talented person planning strategies, how could he be deceived? Therefore, he ignored him and took all the officers out of the east gate of Xuzhou and boarded the train. Seeing that he was determined to leave and could not be dissuaded, Zhang Wensheng asked to stay behind to guard Xuhai and other places, and strongly requested that half of the army be divided and placed under his command to secure the important base. Who knew that Zhang still would not listen, and scolded Wensheng while ordering the train to start. At this time, seeing that there was nothing he could do, Wensheng lay across the tracks in front of the train, preventing it from starting, and wept bitterly, begging him to leave half of the soldiers in Xuzhou. No one could lift him, and the Braided Marshal himself came to drag him, but he would not budge. The two scolded and dragged each other, entangled endlessly. In the end, he agreed to Wensheng's request, ordering him and Bai Baoshan to each guard Xuzhou and Hai in the name of garrison commanders, dividing half of the army to them. Only then was the Braided Marshal able to set off. Later, although the restoration failed, and the Braided Marshal fled into the Dutch embassy in the Dongjiaomin Lane, the government authorities did not dare to publicly resolve the issue of him and his entire Anwu Army, because his old troops were still stationed in Xuhai. Afterwards, they first promoted Zhang Wensheng to Governor of Anhui and transferred him away from Xuzhou. Chen Diaoyuan was then ordered to use swift, unexpected methods to disarm the infantry led by Chen Dexiu overnight, incorporating the more elite troops into Chen's army, and Chen took over as the garrison commander of Xuzhou. In this way, the once-dreaded Braided Army all cut their braids and disappeared, which shows that Zhang Wensheng was not only the Braided Marshal's scolding friend, but also his great benefactor.

### Let Everyone Have Some Food

— Liu Lang

After reading the declaration of the "A Bowl of Rice" campaign by Mr. Roosevelt, President of the United American Relief Association for Chinese Refugees, a multitude of feelings arose, and I felt compelled to speak out.

Americans are willing to eat one less bowl of rice to save our Chinese refugees. However, looking back at Shanghai, the wealthy not only refuse to eat one less bowl of rice but also snatch the rice of many others to feed themselves alone. Despite the steady flow of rice into Shanghai, rice prices continue to rise. Many people have already been forced to give up their rice bowls and turn to making flour, which they are not accustomed to. But flour prices have also soared, forcing many more to become refugees. We can imagine that the bellies of the wealthy are becoming exceptionally full, while the people are becoming increasingly hungry and weak. We seem to see the wealthy opening their bloody mouths to suck the blood of the poor, and we seem to see people lying starving in the streets.

In Mr. Roosevelt's declaration, he also noted the importance of medicine for refugees. How could he not? Young masters and mistresses living in garden villas often feel aches and pains and regularly take good tonics; therefore, it is to be expected that refugees cramped in refugee shelters, which resemble black hells, would suffer from a multitude of diseases. Originally, refugee shelters, due to financial difficulties, could only be perfunctory in dealing with the minor ailments of refugees. Naturally, it is common for minor illnesses to turn into major illnesses, and for major illnesses to lead to death, but "financial difficulties" are ultimately "understandable." But now? With the outbreak of the European war, the wealthy see the opportunity to get rich from the First World War returning, and they are all vying to buy foreign goods, especially Western medicine, because taking medicine when sick is inevitable, and even if medicine prices skyrocket, they are not afraid that patients will not buy it, so profits are guaranteed. Therefore, although Western medicine stocks are sufficient, they are hoarding and speculating, and some medicines are difficult to obtain even at high prices. For the wealthy, who have plenty of money to buy medicine, they naturally don't care. But for those in the middle and lower classes, it is very difficult to get sick; as for refugees, they can only sit and wait for death.

As for using the excuse of refugee relief to exploit and profit from it, it is also a common occurrence. But look at Mr. Roosevelt's declaration for the "A Bowl of Rice" campaign: "All proceeds from this "A Bowl of Rice" campaign will be used for Chinese refugees, and the association's office expenses will not be paid from the donations." How can this be compared to our great philanthropists who organize relief groups to place relatives and friends, falsely report expenses, and pay salaries in name only!

Although these phenomena are colorful, they can be summarized in only one point: the wealthy hate the poor! The reason is simple: the poor are not only of no benefit to them but also harmful to them (such as the harm to their freedom from kidnapping). Therefore, the death of refugees (or the poor) is deserved! If they all die, they can live and work in peace. As for whether the poor are impoverished because they are exploited, or whether they can still obtain cheap labor after the poor die, and whether their products have a large outlet, they are too impatient to think about it. If anyone sees Mr. Roosevelt's second "A Bowl of Rice" campaign, they will definitely want to respond; in fact, it is unnecessary. First, in such chaotic times, almost everyone has trouble feeding themselves, how can they eat less? Second, the wealthy are unwilling to eat less. Third, the establishment of an association only adds a new expense.

Simply put, let's beg the wealthy masters not to steal other people's food, and let everyone have some food!

### Electric Light (Poetry Talk on Machinery)

— Ru Hui

While sorting through old newspapers, I inadvertently found a news item in the "Shen Bao" of September 30th, Guangxu Year 8 (1882), entitled "Prohibition of Electric Lights." The content stated that the use of electric lights in this port had been reported by Dao Xian Shao Inspector to the English Co-Trial Officer Chen Prefect, who had found that there were several Chinese merchants using them and requested instructions for handling the matter. Chen Prefect had ordered the constables to notify each household with the local security guards to prohibit electric lights to avoid accidents. It is said that the shopkeepers also felt that electric lights were not suitable for use, so they all complied with the order.

Looking at it now, this is certainly an amusing incident. But at that time, the sea ban had only recently been lifted, and China had just come into contact with Western civilization. The Chinese people's surprise and apprehension towards the "monster" of electric lights was also understandable.

Therefore, I thought of some poems about "electric lights" at that time. The most wonderful one is found in Volume 1 of the "Flower Cluster Tower Poetry Collection" attached to the "Zi Lin Hu Bao," in the "Shen Jiang Miscellaneous Poems" by Sao Lu Shan Ren: Electricity turns light into a work of nature, Shining red on the streets at night, New travelers are greatly surprised, How can the bright moon be in the rain?

People who saw electric lights for the first time, looking at them from afar, thought they were a bright moon, but because they were in the rain, they couldn't help but be suspicious. This satire is quite humorous. This is just like the later cartoonists depicting a villager lighting a dry tobacco pipe on an electric light, just as interesting. Ye Wenqin's "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Words" also has a poem with a similar artistic conception to Sao Lu Shan Ren's poem: The sea market clearly shows a sleepless sky, Electric lights and gas lights compete in beauty, It's hard to recognize the round moon, No need to say tonight is the Lantern Festival.

At the same time, Su Kanghou's "New Shanghai Bamboo Branch Words" also says: No need to hold candles in this scenic spot, The round pearl is brighter than the moon, Why waste money to buy it, A city that never sleeps opens on the sea.

From these three poems, we can all see how people at that time looked at "electric lights" with surprise. But why is this so? There is no understanding at all, only surprise. However, it is not that no one understands. This can be seen in Wu Rongsen's "Three Poems on Current Affairs," one of which is "Electric Light": Newly made silver lamp shines brightly, Low-hanging electricity glows brightly, Burning flowers compete with the Hengchun tree, Entering the room is like a city that never sleeps.

### People Content to Live in Hell

— Weakling

One night, I returned home close to midnight. In this slum area on the edge of the French Concession, it was rare to see dim lights within a hundred steps. Fumbling into my own home, I lit a wax candle on the table, and looking at my shadow reflected on the wall, I suddenly felt like I was living in hell. My heart, which had been calm for a long time, could not help but be filled with thoughts like tangled hemp; but just like tangled hemp, with a thousand threads and ten thousand strands, I didn't know where to start. Suddenly, I heard a faint conversation outside the window. Who, of those who work at sunrise and rest at sunset, would still be wasting their precious sleep time?

Outside the window of the bedroom was the end of the alley. I looked out through the crack in the window and saw two dark figures curled up in the corner of the wall. In between them, a wax candle was burning. By the faint light, I could see clearly that they were rag pickers from the alley. But at this late hour, they still had the mood to chat, unaware that after dawn, they would not be able to sleep peacefully in this free lodging. At the same time, I chuckled at myself, why was I also wandering alone in my humble room? But since the demon of slumber had been driven away, I might as well light a cigarette and have a long night's talk with them, separated by a window.

I leaned closer to the window, and when I saw clearly what they were doing, I almost bled from my eyes. — These two homeless people, whose lives were not guaranteed, were burning and smoking a potent drug over the flame...

The surrounding area of the "Isolated Island" has been surrounded by a poisonous mist, and this soft aggression policy is killing an unknown number of people! It is admirable that the concession authorities are making every effort to clear the spread of this poisonous flame, but people who do not cherish themselves are throwing themselves into the net. — Even these two homeless people whose lives are not guaranteed!

Dawn is approaching, let these people who are content to live in hell perish under the sun!

### Two Draft Letters

— Zhang Feng

Respectfully, Feng has recently resigned from teaching at school and returned to her old profession, studying Chinese medicine, in order to settle her body and mind after the myriad calamities. As the poem says:

Not because I love the blue mat for its purity, I entrust myself to simple writings before death, I eat my own labor for more than half a hundred years, I close my door and tire of thanking the worthies of the time.

My party is irrelevant, and I am also wasted talent, Circling the branches, I regret not choosing, I endure hunger and seek union to go to immortality, Treading the island, I sing and go back and forth.

### After the Rain, Blue Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Sixteen: Planning with Medicine to Create Scholars is Like an Itch; Thinking Extensively, Saving and Curing to Entrust Children to Something

Now Dr. Lao Tong has a new plan. She traveled to the interior of China last year, to provinces such as Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi. Dr. Lao Zhang is a devout religious person, and their church has branches everywhere in the interior of China, all establishing hospitals of a religious nature. Therefore, Dr. Lao Zhang is not afraid of not being entertained when she goes to the interior. But when she went there to see, the sanitation facilities in the interior of China were really too poor. Local sanitary administration has only been slightly improved in recent years, and before that, it could be said to be equal to zero. Although the people in the churches in the interior have also run several charitable hospitals, they are really very simple. In several secluded counties, they don't know what sanitation is called at all. In some places, it is difficult to see the water surface all year round, and the people do not know how to bathe. In some places, it is said that a person only bathes twice in their life. The first time is when they are just born, crying as they fall to the ground, and take a bath; the second time is on the night before they get married, and they also take a bath. Apart from that, there is never a day to bathe, even after death, they only wipe the body, (no need to bathe.) Sure enough, the water in that place is precious, and the people's cultivation of inertia is also a reason, right? Moreover, the people's ignorance and stubbornness is also the biggest obstacle. Just take one place in the interior that Dr. Lao Zhang went to. Seeing girls of seventeen or eighteen walking, they still walk with that kind of unsteady gait. Looking at their feet again, they all have some deformities, because they were all bound from childhood. Thinking that Chinese women have been unbinding their feet for fifty years, how can there still be girls of seventeen or eighteen with bound feet? In fact, the interior of China was isolated from the outside world in the past. In the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, girls with bound feet have long disappeared, but in those inland areas with closed customs, little girls still have their feet bound at the age of five or six. What is most ridiculous and lamentable is that in some places near the Yi Miao, the Yi Miao women walk barefoot, not binding their feet. But Han women mostly bind their feet. When asked about the reason, they think that the Han are noble and different from the Yi Miao, so they must bind their feet. This kind of ignorance and ridiculousness continued until five or six years before Ding Chou, when the Ministry of Interior sent many female staff members to various places in the interior to investigate. In any place where there are women under the age of ten with bound feet, the local officials will be punished, and the parents of that family will also be guilty. All those who have been bound are forced to unbind them all. But those girls, pitifully, had their foot bones broken by their ignorant and cruel parents. Although they are liberated, walking is still somewhat different. (182)
