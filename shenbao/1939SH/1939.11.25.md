### China's Resistance Strength Greatly Enhanced; Hu Shih Speaks in America

Chongqing. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih gave a speech at the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China last night, stating in part that the strength and morale of China's resistance are now greatly enhanced compared to the beginning of the war. Therefore, China can continue to fight Japan for many years to come. As for Japan, due to the mistakes of its ruling military clique, its economic structure has been severely affected by the war. At the same time, the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact has made Japan's policy towards China even more hesitant and directionless. All of these are beneficial to China.

Editorial

### Sanction Speculation in Rice

In Shanghai recently, prices of everything have risen, especially rice, oil, firewood, and charcoal. This is all caused by the unscrupulous behavior of speculators, and also due to the failure of the concession authorities and social organizations to correct the situation. The population is said to be five million. To entrust the livelihood of five million people to the hands of speculative merchants is extremely dangerous. To knowingly allow this danger to persist without sanctioning it is something that is rare throughout history, except in today's Shanghai.

Among the five million residents, a small number are foreigners. Their income is either based on their national currency or calculated in legal tender with a separate exchange rate compensation. A small number are wealthy families, and a small number are highly paid. All of these are indifferent to the unreasonable rise in prices. However, for the vast majority of the working class, whose monthly income is mostly between twenty or thirty yuan to one hundred yuan, who can afford the high cost of rice? A family of several people who consume three or four sheng of rice a day, with a monthly income of thirty or forty yuan, can barely afford to buy rice. Besides rice, what will they use to pay for rent, clothing, oil, salt, vegetables, firewood, charcoal, and other essential daily expenses? Moreover, the lower the income, the greater the need for rice, as there is no other way to fill their stomachs. Therefore, in wartime, there are often special agencies to manage civilian food supplies, responsible for regulation and price stabilization to stabilize people's livelihood, with penalties for violators. Even in Chongqing, there is a Price Assessment Committee to determine a maximum standard price for rice, coal, and oil, which must be strictly followed. Price increases are not allowed without special permission. Violators are subject to fines of up to one thousand yuan or imprisonment of up to one year. Therefore, even if unscrupulous merchants want to hoard and speculate, they are afraid to do so. Shanghai is not without well-organized organizations and agencies, but in terms of the market and people's livelihood, it is in a state of anarchy. As a result, unscrupulous merchants manipulate the market as they please. The daring of these unscrupulous merchants to manipulate the market has gradually deepened. First, they try it out, and if they succeed in their trickery, they take another step. If there is no interference, they take another step. As a result, their courage grows, their power expands, their manipulation becomes stronger, and their harm becomes wider and more severe. Unscrupulous merchants are hateful, but the authorities turn a blind eye. They cannot escape their serious responsibility for failing to interfere. Some say that unscrupulous merchants have a hundred tricks up their sleeves. If interfered with, they will grandly oppose it, secretly threaten those in between, and sabotage it. If opposition fails and sabotage is ineffective, they will passively resist. Therefore, interference is futile. But we do not believe that unscrupulous merchants are the masters of Shanghai! Nor do we believe that the authority of Shanghai's various organizations and agencies cannot be exercised against unscrupulous merchants! Things must rot from within before insects can breed. Unscrupulous merchants are indeed vermin, but is it not because the authoritative organizations and agencies have failed to address the problem?

Effective interference lies in sanctions. Sanctions must be preceded by investigation. In addition to investigation, there should be rewards for reporting violations. We believe that the concession authorities bear a heavy responsibility and wield great power in the concession. They should transcend the realm of unscrupulous merchants, directly investigate the truth, and, under the premise of resident welfare and internal security, use all possible methods to exert direct and indirect pressure. With regard to rice, in addition to investigating the amount of rice in storage and the daily amount arriving in port and its purchase price, they should investigate the hoarding, mortgage, manipulation, and other situations, and investigate the names of the business owners. Crimes must be punished. If the law cannot punish them, at least detain and interrogate them frequently. Furthermore, take away all the conveniences of their business, residence, and life. Expose them without giving them face. The minimum goal is to prevent unscrupulous merchants from speculating in rice and to prevent financial institutions from supporting the speculation of unscrupulous merchants in rice!

### US Government Attitude Resolute; No Possibility of Renewing US-Japan Commercial Treaty; Japanese Diplomacy Feels Extremely Distressed; Soviet-Japanese Negotiations to be Held in Soviet Capital

Tokyo. At a reception for journalists held here today by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, US-Japan relations were again the subject of questions from reporters. When asked why Japan did not use the same "swiftness" it had shown in starting consultations to readjust relations with the Soviet Union to begin negotiations with the United States with the same objective, the spokesman replied that Japan was eager to maintain good neighborly relations with all countries. If conditions were favorable, it would begin negotiations to readjust relations with the United States and other foreign countries. There was no preconceived notion of which should come first. Negotiations between the United States and Japan to conclude a new commercial treaty are not currently underway. When striving to resolve international events, it is necessary to resolve the China incident. If both sides are keen to reach a compromise, it does not matter which side initiates the effort. When asked about the approximately six hundred pending cases involving the United States and Japan in China, the spokesman said that Japan had never ignored these cases. Although the large-scale war in China had made it extremely difficult for the two countries to find a solution, informal talks between US and Japanese diplomats on this matter are currently underway. Those with deep foresight in both the United States and Japan are eager to prevent the situation between the two countries from being harmed by the worst-case scenario. When asked whether Japan was prepared to grant most-favored-nation treatment to other countries in China after the establishment of a "new central government of China," the spokesman replied that Japan would fully respect foreign interests in China, but everything would depend on developments. (24th Reuters Telegram)

Moscow. Regarding the conclusion of a commercial treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan, it is understood from well-informed sources that negotiations will begin around the end of December. Because the Japanese embassy in the Soviet Union does not have a commercial attache, Japan has proposed that the negotiations take place in Tokyo, while the Soviet Union has requested that the negotiations take place in Moscow. To date, Japan has reportedly acquiesced to the Soviet request. It is understood that the Soviet Union and Japan have not yet concluded a commercial treaty, and if these negotiations are successful, it will be the first time. (23rd Havas Telegram)

### Oxford University Professor Urges British, French, and Soviet Cooperation to Help China Against Japan; Only in This Way Can the Trust of the United States Be Obtained

London. The Manchester Guardian today published a letter from Hughes, a tutor of Chinese at Oxford University, which stated in part that the Far East is where Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have common interests. Since the interests of the three countries are now absolutely incompatible with the aims of Japanese imperialism, they should cooperate practically and provide practical assistance to China. In this way, the trust of the United States can be obtained, and the United States can also be induced to participate in this good work. Then, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can turn to Japan and make it understand the need for the four countries to come forward to mediate in order to establish an appropriate solution to China. Although in this solution, Japanese ambitious people will lose face, Japanese merchants can once again see the Chinese as rational people and still trade with those who are not unforgivable.

### Dong Xianguang Warns Borah

Chongqing. Chinese Vice Minister of Propaganda Dong Xianguang issued a statement today warning Senator Borah, a leader of the American isolationist faction, not to sacrifice American principles for "blood money" by refusing to abandon trade relations with Japan. "The Chinese people hope that Borah will not overemphasize commerce and profit and sacrifice the principles that the American government has always valued. In today's world, unless democratic countries, under the leadership of the United States, adhere to their principles of collective security against aggression, there will be a catastrophe even greater than today's. Even today, to continue selling arms and raw materials for military use to Japan to allow it to invade China and massacre countless innocent Chinese people in order to obtain its 'blood money' cannot be said to be a clear-headed decision." (24th United Press Telegram)

Washington. Under Secretary of State Welles stated this Wednesday that if Japan does not correct its treatment of Americans and commerce in China, the State Department will not continue to negotiate a new commercial treaty with Japan. Isolationist leader Republican Senator Borah expressed dissatisfaction with this, saying, "Trade between the United States and Japan is progressing. We should not easily abandon this business without sufficient reason." (24th United Press Telegram)

### This Year's Higher Civil Service Examinations; Examinees' Performance Ordinary; National Language Skills Poor, Thinking Unclear; Reduce Admission Standards to Show Flexibility

Chongqing. The results of the wartime Higher Civil Service Examinations have been released. The reporter believes that this year's Higher Civil Service Examinations have been changed to preliminary examinations and re-examinations, and training has been added, which is a pioneering initiative. It is of great importance to the country to encourage talent and assist in the future of national construction. The reporter specially visited Shen Shiyuan, Deputy Chairman of the Examination Committee, to ask for his impressions of this examination. According to his statement, although there were occasional good papers, in general, the quality was very ordinary. For example, national language skills were extremely poor, thinking was unclear, and there were many unexpected jokes in the history and geography of our country. There was also a lack of specialized research on the teachings of the President. Other subjects also inevitably had flaws. The reason for this may be due to the relocation of schools and the fact that examinees were running around in displacement and were unable to purchase reference books. The situation was not without its special circumstances. However, learning is not achieved in a day, and the teachings of the President are the foundation of learning and being a person. To be a Chinese person and to be ignorant of common questions about the history and geography of our country is a matter of great concern for cultural progress and national self-awareness. This examination has made it even more apparent that secondary education in the past has been messy and impractical, and university education has been focused on novelty rather than nurturing the fundamentals. It seems that there is a need for revision and correction. In addition, advanced intellectuals should be strict in guiding young people and should not follow the popular trend and forget their roots. If the fundamentals are neglected, even if one has a specialty to be commended, it will not be enough to win the selection of national talent. According to the original evaluation results of this examination, the number of people passing each category was only more than twenty. After consultation with President Dai, the admission standards were lowered, and those with a total average score of 50 or more were given additional points during the review. After reporting to the Examination Committee, a total of 143 people passed. There were no outstanding grades on the entire list. It is estimated that 11 out of every 100 candidates were admitted, which is a higher ratio than in previous Higher Civil Service Examinations. This shows that the evaluation of grades is based on standards, and the admission is intended to show encouragement and progress, and its intention is very profound. President Dai, based on the aim of cherishing young people and broadly planning their future, selected more than 100 people with a score of 45 or more as alternates. The training and future employment methods will be stipulated separately. I personally hope that the students admitted this time will be aware of the inadequacy of their learning, understand the difficulty of the national situation, and work hard to improve their moral character and learning during the training, and strive to repay the country, and that they will have good results in the next re-examination.

### The Accounting Department will convene an Accounting Conference; a preparatory meeting was held yesterday

Chongqing: The Accounting Department was established in April of the 20th year of the Republic of China. It is in charge of national budget, accounting, and statistical affairs.

### Germany Decides to Strengthen Retaliatory Actions Against British and French Blockade Policies; Another British Minesweeper Sunk; Simon Says Full Effort to Cope with Mine Warfare

The Hague: German sources are said to have told reporters from neutral country newspapers stationed in Berlin that "We will intensify mine warfare to retaliate against Britain's blockade of German export trade. Germany will lay mines along the British coast. This action does not violate international law. The Hague Convention prohibits the laying of mines in shipping lanes and enemy ports, but the British government has armed merchant ships and uses warships to escort them, making these ports into war zones." (24th Reuters dispatch)

Berlin: The "German Foreign Policy Review" advises neutral countries to stay away from combat areas in the future. As the mouthpiece of the German government, this warning to neutral countries indicates that Germany intends to take retaliatory actions to strengthen its blockade measures against Britain. (24th Huitong dispatch)

Berlin: The "German General Review" published a lengthy article detailing the military weaknesses of Britain, saying that Britain is surrounded by the sea, and all trade must pass through the sea. Even if Britain takes the measure of warships escorting merchant ships, it still cannot provide adequate protection. Britain has always spent huge sums to build a large navy. In times of war, if a strong enemy fights on the sea, Britain can use its large number of warships to subdue the enemy. However, the situation is different today. Naval warfare has new weapons to adapt to the situation, compete in wisdom, and show ingenuity. Even though Britain has many warships, it can do nothing. (24th Huitong dispatch)

London: Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon declared in the House of Commons yesterday that Germany's "secret placement of magnetic mines" in British waters constitutes a new crisis, and that the British government will use all means to prevent it. (23rd Havas dispatch)

London: It is now learned that several German aircraft flying low over the Thames Estuary on Wednesday night dropped mines by parachute. It is also reported that German seaplanes flying along the east coast of Britain are engaged in laying magnetic mines. According to opinions in the shipping industry, the recent repeated losses of ships must be due to this. Observers reported seeing objects falling from enemy aircraft into the sea, and once saw a German seaplane stopping on the sea, observing its function, which was clearly to lay mines or to have contact with German submarines. It is reported that Germany now has a type of seaplane with special equipment that can carry light mines with very strong explosive power. A floating mine was recently discovered near the Thames Estuary, which was detonated by the British using a rifle. It is reported that experts here predict that Britain also has powerful weapons to counter this. (24th Reuters dispatch)

London: The Admiralty announced that the minesweeper "Aragonite" (315 tons) was destroyed by a mine yesterday and sank immediately, injuring four sailors. (23rd Reuters dispatch)

London: It has just been learned that the British ship "Darino" (1,351 tons) was sunk by a German submarine on the 19th of this month. Eleven crew members who escaped danger have landed in a port in eastern England. The whereabouts of the other sixteen are unknown. In addition, the British fishing boat "Surbain" (387 tons) was also shelled and sunk by a German submarine in the Scottish sea on the 21st of this month. Only seven of the twelve crew members were rescued. (21st, 22nd Havas dispatch)

### Netherlands Protests; Britain Says It Was Unexpected; Interests of Neutral Countries Will Be Fully Considered; Sweden Also Protests Against German Mine Laying

London: Regarding Britain's blockade of German export trade, well-informed sources here recently declared that King George VI is scheduled to issue an order on the 28th of this month, authorizing the competent authorities to confiscate German export goods when they are intercepted. As for Germany's claim that this British action violates international law, responsible people here recently retorted, "This retaliatory measure is permitted by the 1856 Paris Convention." (24th Havas dispatch)

London: The Dutch government has negotiated with the British government to oppose Britain's commercial retaliatory actions against German mine warfare. The Dutch ambassador to Britain stated to the British Foreign Office yesterday that the retaliatory measures proposed by Britain would cause special harm to neutral countries that receive or transport German goods. Responsible parties in London commented that the Dutch action was unexpected because the Netherlands did not say a word about the German plan to cause greater damage to neutral country shipping, but only disagreed with the British action that was purely limited to German goods. Churchill's "The World Crisis" mentions the same method in the last war, saying, "What neutral countries should recognize is that it is impossible and not for the benefit of neutral countries to maintain a situation in which, on the one hand, they want to maintain the various rights of exploitable naval powers, and on the other hand, they allow naval weak countries to abuse their power. The above situation is especially applicable today, because neutral country trade has been greatly damaged as a result of German mine warfare. This British action is just its response. The wider the scope of Germany's ability to support the war, the greater the losses suffered by neutral country ships and sailors. The Allied retaliation is appropriate to shorten the time for German political destruction of world trade. The German government must have anticipated that the British government would stop the transportation of German goods on the high seas, but the British government, in order to take care of the interests of neutral countries, was forced to do so only today. Responsible parties here also said that Germany's propaganda on the North Sea mine laying is inconsistent. Four kinds of propaganda were issued at the same time, such as (1) the mines were laid by the British; (2) the ship sinking incidents in the past few days were German naval victories; (3) even if the mines were laid by the German side, international law allows mine laying to control enemy ships, and there is no need to announce it when military needs require it; (4) severely damage the enemy at key points on overseas shipping lanes. This is Germany's goal in the war. As for how mines can distinguish enemy ships from neutral ships in overseas shipping lanes, German propaganda has never explained it." (24th Reuters dispatch)

Brussels: The Belgian government has decided to negotiate with Britain and France to oppose their retaliatory actions against German mine warfare. The newspapers of the Liberal Party and the Socialist Party in Belgium commented on the British decision, believing that the countermeasures against German naval warfare methods were not blameworthy, but the Catholic Party newspapers did not comment. The Socialist Party newspaper published in Ghent said that protests from neutral countries to the British government were inevitable, but protests should also be made against German naval warfare methods. The Belgian Labour Party newspaper "The People" said that no one can deny that the war makes neutral countries feel inconvenient, but Britain has not sunk neutral country ships or abandoned their passengers and crew at sea to float or sink.

Copenhagen: Reports say that after the German government decided to lay mines in Swedish territorial waters, the Swedish government protested to Germany today. The German government will send representatives to Stockholm to negotiate this issue. (24th Havas dispatch)

### Britain in Negotiations with Denmark and the Netherlands

London: There was a previous saying that the Dutch wartime trade delegation planned to return to the country to ask the government for instructions. Today, it was announced in official circles that the Dutch delegation will remain in London. (24th Reuters dispatch)

### Germany and Denmark Conduct Business Negotiations

Copenhagen: "Tidende" published an editorial today commenting on the German-Danish business negotiations. The article stated that the German-Danish business negotiations began here today. Both sides conducted the negotiations in a moderate attitude and based on reasonable principles. Representatives from Germany and Denmark often complete agreements that satisfy both parties in each business negotiation. This negotiation will naturally also achieve satisfactory results, so that the business relationship between Germany and Denmark will continue to proceed smoothly in a friendly spirit.

### The "Terukuni Maru" Ship Sinking Incident; Which Country Should Be Held Responsible; A Thorough Investigation is Still Pending

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters today that the Japanese government cannot say for sure what kind of action it will take regarding the sinking of the "Terukuni Maru." It was clear that the ship struck a moored mine. Because the accident happened in broad daylight and the weather was clear with good visibility, if it were a floating mine, it would have been visible from two miles away. Smaller ships had passed through the area before the "Terukuni Maru" and did not encounter any misfortune. The Japanese ship weighed more than 12,000 tons and had a deeper draft, so it suffered this disaster. Therefore, it can be determined that it must be a moored mine. According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," the government is now meticulously collecting all information and other necessary materials so that the responsibility for this unfortunate incident can be determined. If the Japanese government blames Germany, it would be tantamount to accusing Germany of indiscriminately using mine warfare against ships of neutral countries. If the government attributes the responsibility for this matter to Britain, it would be tantamount to accusing Britain of laying mines outside designated areas in order to obstruct the commerce of neutral countries. The result of the Japanese government's investigation will be one of the two. It is equivalent to issuing a declaration to please one belligerent country and offend the other. This could lead to Japan being drawn into the vortex of war, even though it has declared its non-intervention in the European war. The newspaper ended by saying that the Cabinet meeting will mention the responsibility for the sinking of the "Terukuni Maru" and will also maintain close contact with other neutral countries, especially Italy.

### Germany Plans to Obtain Raw Material Supplies from Various Neutral Countries; Various Negotiations have Suffered Setbacks

Paris: Germany is negotiating with various neutral countries to obtain raw material supplies, but various negotiations have suffered setbacks. The diplomatic community here is paying close attention to this. Talks between Germany and Norway began on November 16 and were suspended on the 21st after only reaching a preliminary stage. Norway did not accept Germany's proposed method of recruiting Norway to join the German system and reduce its trade with Britain. Negotiations between Germany and Sweden have not been resumed for the same reason. Negotiations between Germany and Romania have yielded some results, but they are still far from what Germany had hoped for. It is reported that the Soviet Union does not allow Romanian goods to be transported to Germany via Ukraine, so Germany feels even more embarrassed. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Stockholm: Responsible parties say that Sweden's exports to Germany in September of this year decreased slightly compared to the same month last year. Rumors that American goods were transported from Sweden to Germany have been disproved. (24th Reuters dispatch)

### Air Battles on the Western Front; Britain Also Lost Two Aircraft; Artillery Battles are Also More Intense Than Before

London: The British Air Ministry issued a communiqué stating that the British Air Force in France shot down seven enemy aircraft on Thursday. There were no casualties among British Air Force personnel, but two aircraft were damaged. (24th Reuters dispatch)

London: A Reuters reporter with the British Air Force on the Western Front cabled that seven British aircraft pilots shot down seven German aircraft in air battles on the Western Front yesterday. The British Air Force Command in France has confirmed that four German Dornier twin-engine monoplane bombers were shot down southeast of Fécamp, and another three crashed near Châlons, Saint-Avold, and Spincourt in the Meuse River area. It is still awaiting confirmation whether one of them was lost with us. It is generally believed that the aircraft crashed behind the German front line. The circumstances of the downed German aircraft found are as follows: British machine gun fire forced a Dornier aircraft to descend near Fécamp. The German pilot landed the aircraft straight into a deep gorge. After landing, the pilot and observer exited the aircraft and dragged out a severely injured gunner. A local villager ran across the fields with only a cane, wanting to prevent them from burning the aircraft, but the observer pointed a pistol at him, making it impossible. The pilot was then able to set the aircraft on fire. Another German aircraft crashed near Châlons, about 20 miles from the air combat site. However, there was only a pilot in the aircraft, and he was not injured. He has now been captured. The other two crew members jumped out with parachutes, one dead and one injured. Another aircraft was found ten miles outside the air combat site. Its machine gun was destroyed. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Paris: The news that eight German aircraft were shot down when a German aircraft group attacked a certain place in France has been completely confirmed. The responsible authorities have carefully inspected the enemy aircraft that crashed within the territory, which does match the number of eight. The surviving enemy pilots have all been captured. The German aircraft that came to attack this time were of two types. One is the Dornier 17, which has a maximum speed of 440 kilometers per hour, can carry 1,200 kilograms of bombs, and can climb to an altitude of 7,000 meters. The aircraft is also equipped with a camera. Once the authorities develop the film, they can determine what mission each of these aircraft was carrying out. The other is the Heinkel, which has a maximum speed of 456 kilometers per hour, can carry 3,000 kilograms of bombs, and can climb to an altitude of 8,000 meters. The aircraft is also equipped with three machine guns. (24th Havas dispatch)

Paris: It is reported that a German aircraft was shot down off the northeast coast of France yesterday morning. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Berlin: The German High Command announced at noon today that trench warfare and reconnaissance activities on the Western Front are becoming more active. The Air Force continued to fly reconnaissance missions into French airspace, and many air battles occurred. A British aircraft was shot down near Verdun, and another was shot down near Saarbrücken. German anti-aircraft guns also shot down a French aircraft near Zweibrücken. In addition, according to the captain of a German submarine, a British cruiser was hit by a German submarine in the Firth of Forth and has been severely damaged. (24th Huitong dispatch)

Paris: According to news here today, another German submarine was sunk by a French ship. A French survey ship glimpsed a torpedo coming through the sea under the moonlight, so it quickly turned its wheels to avoid it and rushed towards the German submarine at maximum speed, dropping depth charges. The submarine never rose again. Including this one, French fleets have sunk three German submarines in recent days. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Paris: The General Headquarters issued a war report yesterday stating that a French destroyer had sunk two German submarines in the past three days. The Navy Department also issued a communiqué today detailing the events. A French seaplane discovered a German submarine on the surface of the sea somewhere. The submarine immediately sank into the water, and the aircraft dropped a buoy where it sank and notified the ships patrolling the sea in the area. The destroyer "Sirocco No. 1" (1,500 tons) rushed to the scene after hearing the news and dropped two batches of underwater bombs at the location of the buoy. Before long, the German submarine was seen floating up, its hull extremely tilted. After ten seconds, it sank. Three days later, the "Sirocco" was patrolling the same area at night and spotted a German submarine sailing on the surface of the sea in the hazy moonlight. It immediately opened fire on it. After the submarine sank, it dropped multiple underwater bombs. The German submarine floated up once and sank in an instant, and oil stains floated up. (23rd Havas dispatch)

### German Submarine Hits British Cruiser

Berlin: Regarding the German submarine hitting the British cruiser "Belfast" in the Firth of Forth in Scotland, the German News Agency commented today that on the 22nd of this month, several American news agencies and the New York Times published news of the German submarine hitting a British cruiser. The news came from London, and there is no doubt that the British Admiralty knew about it. However, since reporters from neutral countries have learned about it from authoritative sources, why hasn't the Admiralty officially announced it? The German News Agency also said, "The 'Belfast' is a newly built warship, having only served for three months, and is equipped with the latest anti-torpedo devices. The anchorage is also strictly protected by mine nets and special observation posts on the coast." (24th Huitong dispatch)

I would like to declare that although our country is currently in difficult and troubled circumstances, we firmly believe that we will overcome the difficulties and become stronger and more transparent. With this goal in mind, we should concentrate our efforts and accomplish great deeds. At this moment, what we cannot ignore is that our 24 million compatriots are in a deep and fiery environment, fighting hard against the enemy. We are responsible to them and must not disappoint them." At this point, all cabinet members stood in silence for one minute to mourn the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves to defend their country. (23rd Havas dispatch)

### Border Kidnapping Incident: Netherlands Protests to Germany, Calling it a Violation of Territory; The Munich Case Remains a Mystery

The Hague: Regarding the kidnapping of two British nationals, Best and Stevens, by Germans in the Dutch border town of Venlo, the Dutch government has sent a note to Germany protesting the violation of territory. The German government has also responded. It is generally believed here that this case could seriously affect relations between the Netherlands and Germany. The "Commercial Gazette" reports that two Dutch citizens were also abducted along with Best and Stevens. According to German political police, one of them is a Dutch army lieutenant named Klop. Although his identity card had a photo, he used more than one name. From this statement, it can be seen that the German political police are falsely accusing these Dutch citizens of being involved in British espionage. (Havas News Agency, 24th)

London: Regarding the bombing in Munich, Germany, news was released yesterday stating that two British spies, Best and Stevens, were involved and had been arrested. In fact, these men were abducted by Germans in the Dutch border town of Venlo (near the German border) on the 9th of last month and have since been held in Berlin. As for the so-called principal offender, Elser, he has been detained in the Dachau concentration camp since 1937. He was released to the Swiss border only a week ago, but was immediately arrested again and accused of being the principal offender in the Munich bombing, which was then heavily publicized. (Havas News Agency, 24th)

London: According to news from the German-Hungarian border from high-ranking National Socialist Party organs, the German government claims that Elser, who confessed to receiving money from the British intelligence service to plant a bomb in a Munich beer cellar, was still imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp a week ago. He and another prisoner were taken to the Swiss border, but after reaching the border, they were taken back to Munich. Then, the Germans widely announced in newspapers that the main culprit in the beer cellar bombing had been arrested. The person who was taken to the border with Elser and then back to Munich was named Büchelrz. It is likely that this person will be one of the figures in the case when Elser is prosecuted. (Reuters News Agency, 24th)

Amsterdam: Regarding the shooting incident involving a Dutch car near Venlo on the German-Dutch border on October 9th, a semi-official statement has just been issued. It stated that there were two British people in the Dutch car, who presented credentials indicating that they had permission to contact Germans to explore the possibility of peace negotiations. Because the Netherlands maintained neutrality, the Dutch authorities sent a Dutch military officer to accompany the British to monitor them. According to Dutch sources, when the car stopped at the border and the two passengers got out, they were suddenly shot at by six people. As a result, one person was killed and one seriously injured. Then, a car came from German territory, pulling the Dutch car, the two wounded men, and everyone else in the car into German territory. The "Dian Wen Bao" stated the main points of the matter, saying, "This happened in Dutch territory, which is beyond doubt. The person who carried out the sniper attack left behind a handgun, bullets, blood stains, and footprints. These Germans are in fact undermining Dutch neutrality and committing crimes punishable by severe penalties under Dutch law. It is a fact that two Dutch and two foreign nationals were abducted from Dutch territory into German territory. At least one of them has been killed in Dutch territory." Reuters has learned that after this incident, well-informed sources here believe that one of the two British men who has been killed is Captain Stevens. It remains to be seen how the Germans will handle his interrogation. It is noted that Captain Stevens was the head of the passport office at the British consulate and had traveled to Venlo a few months ago to handle German immigration matters. (Reuters News Agency, 24th)

Berlin: The official here announced last night a statement disclosing the activities of the British intelligence service. It briefly stated that from November 1937 to 1938, the British intelligence service carried out sabotage operations against many ships, damaging several ships and injuring crew members. The damaged ships included those of Germany, Italy, and Japan. According to Captain Stevens' report and German official investigations, the following facts have now been discovered: the main perpetrator of the ship sabotage was the German exile Pottush, and the instigator was the British intelligence service. Pottush was arrested in December 1938 after German police officers made a request to police officers in a neutral country, but he was released after British authorities intervened in the case. At that time, Pottush had already been detained because the Danzig court had sentenced him to imprisonment on June 29, 1939, for being a British spy. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

### Japan Greatly Lacks Agricultural and Industrial Workers; Trained Soldiers Assist in Harvesting

Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of the Army, in view of the shortage of agricultural and industrial workers in Japan since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, yesterday had no choice but to order the demobilization of a large portion of the troops in the country. This week, the Ministry of the Army announced for the second time the demobilization of soldiers who are currently undergoing training, to help farmers in Hokkaido and other regions with the harvest. The Ministry of the Army also authorized the division commanders in the Kansai and Kyushu regions to shorten the training period of soldiers who are to be demobilized or to extend their training period until after the harvest.

### New Cabinet Established in Romania; Prime Minister Tatarescu

Bucharest: After the Ajegeanu cabinet resigned yesterday, former Ambassador to France Tatarescu formed a new cabinet within a few hours. The new cabinet members were sworn in to King Carol II at an imperial conference in the afternoon of the same day. From 1933 to 1937, Tatarescu repeatedly served as cabinet minister and prime minister, as well as serving as a royal advisor and ambassador to France. He stayed in France for a year and a half and only returned to the country this summer. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

Bucharest: King Carol of Romania ordered former Prime Minister Tatarescu to organize a new cabinet to succeed Ajegeanu, who resigned yesterday. It is expected that Tatarescu's cabinet formation work will be completed today. In addition to members of his own Liberal Party, the cabinet will include members of other parties. It is generally believed that Tatarescu's cabinet formation is to ensure Romania's neutrality and a strong policy of independence. During the recent trade negotiations between Germany and Romania, the suggestions put forward by the German side, regardless of Germany's demands to obtain exclusive rights to Romania's exports, may not be accepted by Tatarescu now that he is in power. (Reuters News Agency, 24th)

Bucharest: The Romanian Ajegeanu cabinet resigned yesterday after disagreements arose following the arrival of a German trade delegation in Bucharest. Former Prime Minister Tatarescu has now formed a new cabinet. Tatarescu is the leader of the National Liberal Party, which is composed of conservatives and nationalists. Under the leadership of the late Bratianu from 1919 to 1928, the party held the highest political power. During the last World War, the party supported the Allied countries and opposed the neutral policy of Prime Minister Machiloman. The downfall of the Ajegeanu cabinet was triggered by the resignation of the Minister of National Economy, Butzoyu. Butzoyu discovered that the German trade methods and demands were incompatible with Romania's current foreign trade system, so he requested the government to adopt a new system that would benefit the people. The government refused to accept it, and Butzoyu resigned. It is heard that the German delegation gained very little from this trip and has now returned to Berlin. (Reuters News Agency, 24th)

### The Soviet Union Makes Three Demands to Finland; Undermining Neutral Status; Finland Decides it is Difficult to Accept

Helsinki: Finnish Prime Minister Kajander stated last night that the Finnish government believes that it is impossible to accept the Soviet Union's recent proposals, because accepting them would simply undermine Finland's neutrality and hand over first-class defensive fortifications to a foreign country. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union's demands include: (1) a mutual assistance treaty, (2) ceding Finnish territory in the Leningrad region in exchange for a portion of Karelia, and (3) ceding certain islands in the Gulf of Finland as Soviet naval bases. (Reuters News Agency, 24th)

Helsinki: After the Finnish government received verbal attacks from the Moscow Radio Station, government leaders convened a special meeting last night to discuss the current situation and plan countermeasures. The speech broadcast by Moscow Radio condemned Finland for not reaching an understanding with the Soviet Union to resolve the disputes between the two countries. According to semi-official sources, the Finnish government decided last night to follow a peaceful path to resolve the disputes between Finland and the Soviet Union. It is expected that the Soviet Union will issue another invitation, inviting Finland to continue negotiations. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

### Zhangjia Donates 10,000 Yuan to Comfort Soldiers

Chongqing: National Government Committee member Zhangjia Hutuktu is the only surviving religious leader among the four major Mongolian-Tibetan religious leaders (the Dalai Lama, Panchen Lama, and Jebtsundamba Khutuktu have all passed away). He enjoys the faith and worship of Mongolian officials and civilians. After the start of the "August 13th" Chinese National Self-Defense War, the Living Buddha resolutely left Mount Wutai for Beijing, then from Beijing to Hankou to Chongqing to Chengdu, always expressing solidarity with the country. The movable property, Buddhist implements, and Buddhist implements stored over the generations in the major temples under the jurisdiction of the Living Buddha in Rehe, Duolun, Beiping, and Mount Wutai have suffered losses of no less than millions, but the Living Buddha does not care about this. This time, he came to Chongqing to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and, concerned about the hardships of the soldiers fighting on the front lines, he will donate 10,000 yuan to comfort them, as a sign of respect. The soldiers on the front lines will surely be encouraged by this news, and Mongolian and Tibetan officials and civilians will also be inspired to unite more strongly. The impact will not only be this material encouragement. The Living Buddha flew back to Chengdu the morning before yesterday. (News Agency, 24th)

### Severe Coal Shortage in Tianjin Concessions; US Consul Protests to Japan

Tianjin: US Consul in Tianjin, Galtway, today, at the request of the American Chamber of Commerce in Tianjin, protested to the Japanese side regarding the severe coal shortage in the British and French concessions, believing that this method is not only greatly uncomfortable but also hinders trade. US Consul in Tianjin, Galtway, reported the coal shortage situation in Tianjin Concessions to the US State Department last week, and said that in the area controlled by the Japanese near the Tianjin Concessions, there are a large number of coal reserves. According to Mr. Galtway, he has discussed and negotiated with Japanese officials on this matter every day, but there has been no result.

### Japanese Troops Attempt to Occupy Southeast Township of Jiangyin; Fierce Battle for Three Days, Unsuccessful

Changyinsha Correspondence: The southeast township area of the county is guarded by the Chinese army's Yuan unit. The Japanese army has repeatedly attacked, but has ultimately been unsuccessful. A month ago, after the Zhizi-Nebu unit suffered heavy losses in the Zhutang area, it wanted to retaliate. On the 14th of this month, it joined forces with the Wu Teng and Sanzhai units, dividing into three routes—east, south, and west—under the command of Tanaka, intending to surround Guonan Township. However, the Chinese army was already prepared. A fierce battle broke out in Huashi Shayang. The Japanese army used airplanes to drop dozens of small bombs in Houteng Yangku, killing and wounding more than ten people and destroying several civilian houses. On the 15th and 16th, the Chinese and Japanese armies were still in a stalemate in the southeast township. The Japanese army's purpose in occupying the southeast township was to collect land taxes, but it was resisted by the Chinese army, and it became just a dream.

### Fierce Battle of Japanese Airplanes Attacking Chengdu; Leader of the Japanese Air Force Shot Down; King of Japanese Bombing Also Killed

Chengdu Aviation News: At noon on November 4th, 54 Japanese airplanes, divided into two batches, attacked Chengdu. The Chinese Air Force's Divine Eagle Team heard the alarm and immediately took off to intercept them. A fierce battle broke out in the northern suburbs of the city. After blindly dropping bombs in the wilderness, the Japanese airplanes fled in panic. The Chinese Air Force squadron pursued them fiercely, first destroying the leading airplane of the second batch of 27 Japanese airplanes, and then hitting many more Japanese airplanes, achieving a great victory and returning safely. Apart from Squadron Leader Cen suffering minor injuries, everyone else was safe. According to reports from the air defense observation posts, 18 Japanese airplanes did not leave Sichuan that day. Three Japanese airplane wreckage were found, but the rest have not yet been discovered. Colonel Okuda, known as the "King of Bombing" in the Japanese Air Force, came to China this spring and repeatedly led Japanese airplanes to bomb Liangshan, Chongqing, and Chengdu. This time, he was killed by the Chinese Air Force. As for the Japanese airplane wreckage and captured Japanese Air Force personnel that have been found, they were transported to Chengdu on the 9th and are being exhibited in Shaocheng Park. The battle situation of the 4th is recorded as follows:

Air Combat Situation

On the morning of November 4th, the continuous rain had just cleared, and the autumn sky was exceptionally clear. At 9:08 AM, the air defense observation post suddenly issued an advance warning that 54 Japanese airplanes, divided into two large formations, each with 27 airplanes, had invaded Sichuan territory from the northeast of Sichuan. At 10:00 AM, the Japanese airplanes reached [illegible], and Chengdu also issued an air raid alarm. At this time, all the citizens of the city had completely taken refuge in safe places. Aviation Committee Director Zhou Zhirou and Air Defense Commander Deng Xihou went to a certain place to command the Chinese Air Force and the警戒 units to prepare for battle. At 10:40 AM, the emergency alarm was issued. The Chinese Air Force [illegible] unit had already taken off and formed a formation at an altitude of 10,000 feet, waiting in strict formation. At 11:00 AM, the first batch of Japanese airplanes, due to the brave charge of the Chinese Air Force, could not sneak into the city air and blindly dropped bombs in the suburbs of a small county near Chengdu before fleeing in panic. The second batch of 27 Japanese airplanes took the opportunity to sneak into the suburbs of Chengdu. The Chinese Divine Eagle Team had already seen them and immediately launched a fierce attack, surrounding them from all sides. Another Divine Eagle suddenly pounced into the Japanese airplane formation from high altitude and then turned to shoot at the left and right sides of the Japanese team. The battle was extremely fierce, and the Japanese airplane's ladder-shaped formation was disrupted, so they dared not linger and fled east in panic. The Chinese ground air defense anti-aircraft guns also spewed out angry flames to bombard the Japanese airplanes. The Chinese Air Force pursued even more bravely until a considerable distance before returning safely. At 12:05 PM, the alarm was lifted.

Japanese Airplane Crashes into River

When the first batch of Japanese airplanes attacked Chengdu, the Chinese anti-aircraft artillery team fired all their guns, hitting a Japanese airplane. The fuel tank caught fire and fell near Zhonghechang in Huayang County. Another airplane fell at Yuantong Temple at the junction of Huayang and Renshou Counties. In addition, two more Japanese airplanes destroyed by the Chinese Air Force crashed. One crashed at Guanyin Temple in Renshou County, and the other crashed in Jianyang. When the second batch of Japanese airplanes fled east, their leading airplane was shot down by the Chinese Air Force. The wreckage of the airplane crashed in the territory of Zhongjiang County. The fuselage was completely destroyed, and the seven aviation officers and soldiers on board were all burned to death. Only four machine guns and several pistols were left. There were also several Japanese Air Force personnel captured from the Japanese airplane that crashed in Renshou.

King of Bombing

Documents found on the bodies of the Japanese Air Force personnel proved that one of them was Colonel Okuda. According to the Japanese, the four great kings of fighter planes were Bai Xiangdingnan, Chaotian Liangping, Limoto Minjing, and Southwest Township Maoshang. From the Shanghai-Nanjing Battle to the Wuhan Battle, all have been wiped out by the Chinese Air Force. This last surviving Okuda, Kikuwara Colonel, is known as the "King of Bombing" in the Japanese Air Force. He came to China this spring and led teams to bomb Chongqing, Chengdu, Liangshan, and other places. Chengdu suffered a brutal bombing on June 2nd, which was also led by Okuda. This time, he was shot down, and the people of Chengdu all celebrated and rejoiced. Furthermore, from the wreckage of the Japanese airplane, it was identified as being manufactured in August of the Showa 14th year (1928 of the Republic of China), which further proves the great achievements of the Chinese Air Force's resistance war over the past three years. Not only have the Japanese Air Force personnel suffered heavy casualties, but the Japanese airplanes have also been exhausted. Okuda was 44 years old and the commander of the Japanese Naval Air Force. He was appointed as a second lieutenant candidate in the Taisho 3rd year and promoted to second lieutenant the following year. He was appointed as a major in the Taisho 15th year and promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Showa 6th year and colonel in the 12th year. He served as the chief of the first section of the general affairs department of the naval aviation department of the naval headquarters and as a member of the technical conference, and other important positions.

Casualty Investigation

When the Japanese airplanes invaded the suburbs of Chengdu, they were fiercely intercepted by the Chinese Air Force and were unable to invade the city air. They blindly dropped many bombs in the suburbs of [illegible] and [illegible], destroying dozens of thatched houses and killing and wounding a dozen civilians. In addition, in the suburbs of a certain small county near Chengdu, they dropped many bombs at [illegible] and other places, destroying several thatched houses. The rest landed in the wilderness. Several civilians were injured by stray bullets outside the New East Gate. After the alarm was lifted, the Provincial Capital Air Raid Emergency Relief Office immediately dispatched a survey team led by team leader Sun Qunyi to rush to the bombed areas to investigate, and the rescue team and stretcher team were dispatched separately for rescue.

All Sectors Comfort the Troops

The news of the great victory in the air battle spread, and the citizens were overjoyed. On the morning of the 5th, people from all walks of life sent representatives carrying flowers, food, and banners to the Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery team's bases to comfort them separately. They also cheered and celebrated the victory of the Chinese Air Force along the way. The Sichuan Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League and the Sichuan Provincial Mobilization Committee's Rural Service Group also sent representatives with flowers to comfort them on the afternoon of the 6th. Deputy Squadron Leader Wang of the [illegible] Squadron of the 4th Air Battle introduced the officers and soldiers of the air battle on that day to meet, and squadron leaders Xie Ma described the detailed process of defeating the Japanese airplanes on that day. The representatives warmly comforted the officers and soldiers who participated in the battle and wished them good health. In the afternoon, they sent personnel to Renji Hospital to comfort Squadron Leader Cen, who was injured in the air battle that day. Furthermore, people from all walks of life in Chengdu held a grand ceremony to comfort the Air Force and present flags on the 10th. In the afternoon, party, government, and military agencies in the Sichuan provincial capital also sent representatives to comfort the Air Force.

Squadron Leader Interview

At 3:30 PM on the 6th, the reporter visited Squadron Leader Cen at Renji Hospital. At that time, a foreign doctor was examining his scars. His spirits were very high. He then talked about the battle on the 4th and the injuries he sustained. He said, "After we received intelligence that enemy airplanes were attacking Chengdu that day, we immediately took off to警戒. When the team of airplanes I was leading had been airborne for 35 minutes, we encountered the enemy airplanes. Before the enemy airplanes had even begun to drop bombs, I directed my wingmen to launch a fierce attack on the enemy in the city air. Because the enemy airplanes' firepower was very dense, when I carried out several surprise attacks and the enemy airplanes were about to flee, my airplane unexpectedly had a small problem. Immediately, I smelled a foul odor surrounding me. I knew that if I persisted any longer, I would be forced to land, so I flew the airplane back. When approaching the airfield, I was forced to land. Fortunately, I was only slightly injured in the 機身, and the skin under my right eye was slightly injured, but it's not serious." Squadron Leader Cen is 28 years old this year, from Enping County, Guangdong. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he has participated in the Air Force. He has participated in the Shanghai, Poking, Hankou, and recent Chongqing and Lanzhou battles. (November 9th)

### Suzhou Rice Prices Soar: Japanese Control Outbound Shipments, Rice Merchants Hoard for High Prices

Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese Special Service Unit in Suzhou City, under the guise of "adjusting agricultural products," established a materials exchange and controlled food supplies. Due to soaring rice prices, they once strictly prohibited it, allowing farmers to freely transport and sell their rice. However, recently, due to too many "absorbing households" in the city, such as Longmao outside Qimen, which alone imported over two thousand piculs, and other firms like Sanfeng, Zhaoyuan, Xiechang, and Yuanda, which also imported large quantities, market prices have skyrocketed. High-quality winter rice is priced at 24.6 yuan, old winter rice at 24.3 yuan, second-grade winter rice at 24 yuan, old high-quality white rice at 24.2 yuan, new high-quality white rice at 24 yuan, new second-grade rice at 23.7 yuan, new medium-grade indica rice at 24 yuan, and new fragrant pearl rice at 14.7 yuan. High-quality white rice is priced at 26.6 yuan. The reason for the soaring rice prices is that farmers in rice-producing areas who want to transport rice out are being intercepted by guerrillas and not allowed to do so. Rice merchants, seeing the high rice prices in Shanghai, believe that they can still profit by transporting rice from Suzhou. Some obtain export permits under Japanese merchant banners to transport Suzhou rice to Shanghai. Now, Guangshu, the director of the Japanese Special Service Agency's management department, has banned rice exports, while still subjecting it to the control of the materials exchange. Therefore, the amount of rice transported to Shanghai has decreased sharply in recent days.

### Funing Puppet Troops Revolt, Eight Japanese Soldiers Killed

Funing Communication: After Funing fell this spring, the Japanese army used Zhu Baoyuan and over a hundred others as guides, disturbing various towns and villages in the surrounding areas. Yesterday, eight Japanese soldiers, along with Zhu and others, went to the Haligang area in Dongxiang, attempting to suppress the Chinese army. However, Zhu, unable to endure the usual oppression by the Japanese army, seized the opportunity to take over a hundred rifles and several heavy and light machine guns. Upon arriving at the port, they immediately revolted, killing all eight Japanese soldiers. They then took the weapons and contacted Huang Gongzheng, the battalion commander of the county's regular army, to cooperate. County Magistrate Xiong Yanghe then appointed Zhu as a battalion commander. The Japanese army stationed in Chenjiayang Tongyang Port, upon hearing this, were furious and burned down most of the civilian houses in the town and along the riverbanks in Liutang and other places. When they tried to return to the city, they were intercepted by the Chinese army and retreated to Hexing Town. Yesterday, they retreated to the estuary of Sheyang Lake. The Japanese army in Funing City is now quite panicked.

### Ministry of Education Launches Intellectuals to Conduct Mass Education, Requests Central Government to Order Provincial and Municipal Party Departments to Assist

### Shanghai: A Glimpse of Talent Supply and Demand Two Years After the War (V)

— Pan Wen'an, Zheng Wenhan, Shen Guanglie

Only 14.65% of jobs offer 11 to 20 yuan, less than half of those seeking such pay, and lower than the previous year. The same is true for 21 to 30 yuan. The percentage for 31 to 40 yuan is even lower, while 41 to 50 yuan surprisingly accounts for 25.01%. This unique situation is due to several inland transportation companies needing a large number of drivers, but there are too few job seekers with this ability, so less than 2% are successfully hired (see Tables 7 and 10). 51 to 60 yuan accounts for 1.22%, 61 to 70 yuan accounts for 3.6%, and opportunities above 71 yuan are extremely rare, totaling only 0.6%. Opportunities for commission-based compensation account for 22.44% of total compensation. This type of compensation depends entirely on sales ability, which benefits the employing organization the more people there are, but very few job seekers believe they have sales ability (see Table 3). This type of compensation is practically worse than a salary of less than 10 yuan for them. In general, the compensation offered by employers is still lower than the compensation sought by job seekers, which on the one hand shows the decline of the isolated island economy, and on the other hand can help prove why some opportunities are not taken. The most opportunities for talent recruitment are still commercial in nature, with the most common position being salesperson, but most of these positions are calculated on a commission basis, except for a few who are paid a salary. There are very few people willing to take the job and have sales ability, so most of these opportunities are missed. The next most common position is trainee, with extremely low pay, usually only providing room and board and a small allowance for shoes and socks. The next most common opportunities are for salespersons, managers, clerks, bookkeepers, accountants, etc., but there are not many of these opportunities. Compared with the previous year, the percentage has decreased significantly. This year it accounts for less than 39% of the total opportunities (the previous year accounted for 59.6%). The next most numerous opportunities for talent recruitment are in transportation, accounting for 29.55%, a newly emerging opportunity this year. Detailed breakdowns include drivers, telegraphers, and combined telegraph report operators, with better pay and most service organizations located inland. There are also considerable opportunities for skilled workers, such as auto repair, sand casting, planer, lathe, and weaving. Educational and literary talents tend to be teachers in primary and secondary schools, tutors, and clerks. Opportunities for industrial and engineering talents are even rarer than in the previous year. Large-scale industries have moved inland, so opportunities have naturally decreased.

Talent Recruitment Compensation Classification (Table 8)

Supply and Demand Comparison

The above discussion can give a general picture of the overall situation of talent supply and demand. The number of job seekers and job opportunities are not very different and seem to be able to adapt to each other. However, in reality, what are the achievements? According to the statistics in Tables 7 and 8, there are 2,027 job opportunities, and only 637 people were successfully placed, less than one-third of the job opportunities, and even lower compared to the total number of job seekers, only slightly more than one-fourth. The number is extremely small. The main reasons for the analysis are: Firstly, few job seekers have specialized skills, and they cannot adapt to the arrival of opportunities. Secondly, the duties required for the job do not meet the needs of job seekers, such as salespersons and drivers. Thirdly, the compensation given by employers is excessively low, far less than the general level before the war, and the required education level and experience are excessively high. It is no wonder that the situation of mismatch between supply and demand has increased.

Male 556 87.30

Female 81 12.70

Total 637 100.00

### Ministry of Education Adds Fourth Drama Troupe

(Chongqing Aviation News) The Ministry of Education has attached great importance to drama education in recent years, such as selecting and compiling drama selections, reviewing and approving banned Peking opera repertoires, designating the National Drama School to study our country's inherent drama, and the Shandong Provincial Drama Theater to focus on studying opera.

### Finance: Rumors Spread, Gold Prices Rise Alarmingly Again, Exchange Rate Unexpectedly Weak, Rise Feels More Powerful, Closing at a High of 3,800 Yuan

Yesterday, the cash scalping dark market saw prices soar following the sharp contraction of the exchange rate, breaking through the 3,800 yuan mark. The recent vigorous gold market was even more prosperous. Operators were both happy and worried, as the rise came unexpectedly quickly. The market opened steadily in the morning, slightly lower by three yuan, at 3,730 yuan. Shortly after, the exchange rate was reported to be slightly weak. A certain money exchange business took the lead in buying, and the price reached 3,750 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange rate turned soft, pawnshops rushed to sell, and securities firms also sold, a certain gold firm also sold off, and although a certain money exchange business still had demand, it felt insufficient, and the market fell to a low of 3,710 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange rate stopped falling and gradually stabilized. Hong Kong gangs suddenly became active, and the noon closing was pulled up by more than ten yuan, closing at 3,728 yuan. The afternoon started flat, but the underlying trend was firm. As late as 2:30 pm, rumors spread, and the exchange rate contracted. A certain bank searched and bought aggressively, gold firms continued to absorb, securities firms also switched from selling to buying, and Hong Kong gangs were even more active. Although cash firms, pawnshops, and retail investors who made profits took the opportunity to supply, the supply was less than the demand, and the price soared to 3,380 yuan. In an instant, because sellers were hard to find, the price jumped another 40 yuan, closing at a high of 3,820 yuan. Trading was very active, with as many as three to four thousand taels. The initial price of gold ornaments in pawnshops was set, and then raised by five yuan. Customs gold prices remained flat.

Scalping Soars by 87 Yuan

Since the early hours of the morning, each tael (ten liang), the initial situation was still flat. The cash firm first sold 20 taels to the money exchange business for 3,730 yuan, which was three yuan lower than the previous day. Shortly after, the rise suddenly started, and it was heard that the exchange rate was tight, and people were encouraged. A certain gold firm and money exchange business scrambled to buy, and at that time a certain firm in the securities business also had a slight appetite, so the market soared by 20 yuan. The securities firm sold 10 taels to the gold firm for 3,750 yuan. Later, the selling intention of pawnshops turned strong, and the exchange rate had turned soft, and a certain securities firm came to sell, and the market could not support it, and immediately fell by 10 yuan. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the money exchange business for 3,740 yuan. At that time, although a certain money exchange business's appetite turned stronger, a certain gold firm suddenly stopped buying aggressively, and soon fell another 30 yuan. The money exchange business bought 10 taels from the gold firm for 3,710 yuan. After that, the exchange rate turned flat, and the Hong Kong gang came to activity, and the selling wind gradually dissipated, and the market gradually returned to flat, pulling up 24 yuan. The gold firm bought 50 taels from the money exchange business for 3,734 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm sold on behalf of customers, and then fell slightly to 3,725 yuan. At noon, a certain money exchange business and a certain bank bought each other, and then rose by 8 yuan. The money exchange business bought 10 taels from the securities firm for 3,733 yuan. By the time of closing, a certain securities firm continued to sell, and immediately fell by 6 yuan. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the gold firm for 3,727 yuan. Then the securities firm sold another 10 taels to a certain bank for 3,728 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opened flat, first the pawnshops bought 10 taels from the gold firm for 3,730 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher. Later, a certain pawnshop and money exchange business competed to buy, and immediately raised it by 15 yuan. The money exchange business bought 30 taels from the securities firm for 3,745 yuan. At that time, the securities firm continued to sell more than 100 taels, and once slightly returned. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the pawnshops for 3,735 yuan. Later, because the foreign exchange rate was reported to be weak, it caused a buying wind. A certain gold firm and a certain bank each absorbed dozens of taels, and then rose by 7 yuan to 3,742 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange business slightly returned, once slightly 4 yuan, for 3,738 yuan. After that, there were sudden rumors in the market, and the foreign exchange rate was tightened. The atmosphere of speculation was pervasive, and the general sellers were as drunk as they were. A certain bank, money exchange business and securities firms etc. mutually released orders to buy, although pawnshops and cash firms and retail investors who made profits sold out, they still could not suppress the fierce momentum. In an instant, it had soared to 3,780 yuan. The buying wind was even stronger after entering, but the sellers were gradually lacking, so the rising trend was even sharper. In an instant, it rushed out of the 3,800 yuan mark. A certain gold firm in the securities business bought a total of 40 taels from the pawnshops and securities firms for 3,820 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it continued to rise by 87 yuan. It was heard that after the closing, it once fell back to 3,805 yuan due to retail investors selling out. Later, it was finally pulled back up to 3,820 yuan due to buyers coming again. The whole day was up and down 110 yuan. The selling price of the cash firm's brand gold was 10 yuan higher according to scalping. The received amount decreased by more than 20 yuan. The current bidding gold is 560 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few transactions.

Gold Ornaments Hang at 5 Yuan Higher in the Evening

At the beginning of the sale of gold jewelry in pawnshops, Datong Bank still suspended at 380 yuan per tael. By 4:05 pm, it hung at 5 yuan higher. As a result, Datong Bank changed to suspend at 385 yuan. The new bank was the same as the above price. The receiving was 15 yuan lower.

### Sudden Change in the Foreign Exchange Market: Qiao Zhifu Makes Massive Purchases Eight Times a Day; British Gold Nears the Five Pence Mark

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listing price. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates was stable in the morning session. Unexpectedly, rumors spread in the afternoon that Japan was implementing new economic aggression policies and that a certain Chinese official was changing their position. This led to massive buying of foreign exchange by Japanese firms. The Jewish trader Qiao Zhifu also heard the news and covered his short positions (said to be worth £400,000). As a result, the closing price (tight at five pence 0.0625) exceeded expectations compared to yesterday's soft close. The opening was uneventful with little activity. Later, some Chinese merchants continued to buy, but this was offset by exporters supplying funds, resulting in a slight tightening. British gold was at five pence 0.03125 and the US dollar at eight yuan 4.0625. However, some profits were quickly taken, stabilizing the situation. Subsequently, Hong Kong Electric suddenly supplied funds, and Chinese merchants also switched from buying to selling. Although some tried to buy again at cheaper prices, the market remained loose. British gold was at five pence 0.25, and the US dollar also reached eight yuan and a half. By noon, selling had disappeared, and buyers vanished as well, resulting in a stagnant market. There were no changes until the closing, remaining the same as the morning opening. The afternoon opening was initially unchanged. However, after 2:30 PM, the market suddenly became turbulent. Japanese firms started buying heavily, and Qiao Zhifu covered his short positions in large amounts. Foreign firms also increased their settlements. Although foreign banks like McAlister supplied funds, the supply could not meet the demand, and the market tightened sharply to five pence 0.0625 and eight yuan 1.875 at closing. This was one point five six two five tighter and twenty-five softer than the previous day. The futures market remained the same as the spot market.

The Morning Market Was Particularly Calm

The morning started calmly, with London exchange rates flat. Silver prices in New York and foreign exchange rates for the US dollar were closed for Thanksgiving. London gold remained stable. Exchange rates between British and US dollars, British and French francs, and British and Shanghai dollars were all flat. Central bank listing prices for various currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened the spot market with a selling price of five pence 0.21875 for British gold and eight yuan 4.375 for the US dollar, with no change from the previous close. Although exporters sold slightly after the opening, Chinese merchants and beneficial parties bought, causing a temporary imbalance in supply and demand. The market showed a slight softening. Beneficial parties bought spot British gold from exporters and foreign banks at five pence 0.2875 and 0.203125. Later, Chinese merchants bought spot US dollars from a major bank at eight yuan 4.0625. The HSBC listing price was not strong, and there was no change in the silver balance tax. Afterwards, beneficial parties started to sell, and Hong Kong Electric suddenly supplied funds, causing Chinese merchants to sell as well. The market shifted from tight to loose. Beneficial parties sold spot US dollars to currency exchange businesses at eight yuan 4.375. Subsequently, Hong Kong Electric, Chinese merchants, and certain banks sold spot British gold to Huabi and beneficial parties at five pence 0.21875 and 0.25, and spot US dollars at eight yuan 4.375 and half a yuan. Near noon, selling subsided, and buyers disappeared, resulting in a flat market. At the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were five pence 0.21875 for British gold and eight yuan 4.375 for the US dollar, unchanged from the morning opening.

Rumors Trigger Buying Frenzy

The afternoon market was initially flat. However, after 2:30 PM, the market suddenly became turbulent. Japanese firms started buying heavily, and it was rumored that the Jewish trader Qiao Zhifu had large short positions and was urgently covering them. This spurred speculation and buying among foreign firms. Although foreign banks like McAlister were willing to supply funds, the demand still far exceeded the supply, causing the market to tighten sharply. Japanese firms, foreign firms, and speculators bought spot British gold from McAlister and certain foreign banks at five pence 0.1875 to 0.09375, and spot US dollars from eight yuan 3.75 to 2.25. The willingness of foreign banks to supply funds diminished further. At the late closing, the bank's spot selling prices were five pence 0.0625 for British gold and only eight yuan 1.875 for the US dollar. December British gold was at five pence and the US dollar at eight yuan 0.625. As a result, spot and futures British gold were one point five six two five tighter and the US dollar was twenty-five softer than the previous day.

### Foreign Currencies Surge

Yesterday, foreign currencies were very stable in the morning, with most remaining unchanged. After 3:00 PM in the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that a certain important person had resigned, causing drastic changes in the market. There was strong buying of British and US gold pounds, and the market price rose sharply. Customers were eagerly buying British and US gold notes, and the market price rose sharply. US gold notes were only eleven yuan and nine jiao in the morning, but the surge was severe in the afternoon, reaching twelve yuan and three jiao and three fen in the evening market. There was strong demand for Hong Kong notes and French franc notes, and the market was firm. Singapore, Dutch, Annam, and Robbie notes were frequently requested by customers, and the supply from currency exchange businesses was insufficient, causing prices to rise. Canadian and Philippine notes followed the US gold notes and rose sharply. There was little supply or demand for Australian gold notes for a long time. Today, the difference between the Australian gold notes and British gold notes was too large, and there was some demand, causing prices to rise sharply. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes were balanced, and the market was stable, remaining at one yuan two jiao five fen five li in the evening market. The demand for Korean notes increased, and the evening market price was one yuan one jiao four fen two li.

Australian gold notes rose by three yuan. Only Italian and Siamese notes remained unchanged.

### Securities: Foreign Stock Trading Sets New Record

The unofficial securities market was stagnant and fluctuating yesterday. After various parties pushed up the market prices, different groups felt hesitant and uncertain. The current situation is brewing and becoming more complex, with the black and white yet to be distinguished. Speculation is dangerous at this time. At this critical moment, the speech will occur in the autumn. Yesterday passed peacefully in the morning, but weakly in the afternoon. The stomach for large volumes was better, and the bulls added to their positions. Some say that someone will become a minister again, but it is doubtful whether support will be held. The market price of Ding-type stocks was slightly lower by five fen, while the rest continued to improve by about one jiao. The total turnover was about four to five hundred thousand yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

Stock Transaction: 15 shares of Guanshengyuan stock were traded at a price of thirty-two yuan and five jiao.

Yesterday, the public stock market continued to surge, ignoring a large amount of profit-taking. Several stocks set new high price records. The closing trend was exceptionally strong. The trading volume was extremely high, setting a new record for daily trading. Previously, the highest trading volume was 510,000 shares on March 18, 1937, but yesterday it reached an unprecedented number of 560,107 shares. The closing prices of heavily traded stocks are listed below.

Yesterday's trading was dominated by Paddington, Rubber, Trust, Tai Nama La, and Langezhi stocks.

### Ruiyong Shipyard Liquidation Plan; Maotai Shanghai Tugboat Pays Dividends

Since the British Ruiyong Shipyard Co., Ltd. merged with Yesong Dockyard to establish the British Union Shipyard Co., Ltd., its business has gradually improved in recent years. All the company's assets are represented by the shares of the British Union Shipyard. Rather than maintaining the status quo, it is better to liquidate the company as soon as possible and distribute the shares of the British Union Shipyard directly to the shareholders, which can slightly reduce various administrative expenses. When British Union Shipyard paid an interim dividend of 5% this spring, this plan was already being considered. According to the then projections, if the British Union Shipyard's final dividend was also 5%, then after Ruiyong's liquidation, in addition to recovering the preferred shares and clearing various debts, ten Ruiyong ordinary shares could be distributed with nine British Union shares. However, since the Year of the Ox, the business of British Union Shipyard has been exceptionally good, and it is estimated that the final dividend can be slightly better than previously estimated. Therefore, the liquidation result of Ruiyong can be even more satisfactory. At the extraordinary general meeting held at the beginning of this month, the board of directors submitted the proposed liquidation plan for discussion. The contents are roughly as follows:

(1) All debts will be paid in full at face value (including the general manager's compensation of 75,000 yuan in cash and 5,000 shares of British Union).

(2) All preferred shares will be redeemed, and dividends will cease from the date of liquidation.

(3) One share of British Union stock will be paid for each ordinary share.

(4) If there is any surplus, additional cash will be paid.

The British Maotai Trading Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay an interim dividend for 1939 on December 8, at a rate of three yuan per share in national currency.

The British Shanghai Tugboat Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay dividends in December. The preferred shares will pay an interim dividend of 3.5%, equivalent to one tael and seven qian and five fen of silver. The ordinary shares will pay a dividend of eight yuan in national currency per share.

### Yarn and Cotton: Same Traders Importing Cotton Becomes Increasingly Heated; Coarse Cotton Becomes More Popular; Ignition Flower Cotton Continues to Rise

The transaction of local cotton is extremely frequent. Same traders buy and sell with each other frequently. Same traders purchased 500 bales of American cotton and settled at the block corner price. Most have the same goal and are optimistic. The reason is that the production this year is not abundant, and the sources from all sides are limited. Secondly, the prices of American and Indian cotton markets are hopeless in this war era. Therefore, although factory consumption is not prosperous, traders' intention to import is more enthusiastic. Today's Bombay telegram predicted that Indian cotton would fall by 10 Robbie, but people's minds were not affected in the slightest. The situation of fine cotton is still moderate because American cotton can still be purchased, but coarse cotton has Yuyao cotton, which is now under the strict control of the national government to protect resources, and the import to Shanghai is blocked. The corner block price of Indian cotton has risen sharply, and the calculation is not good. Therefore, the two items of ignition machine and Tongzhou coarse cotton have become popular, and the selling price has advanced steadily, rising by two or three yuan from the previous day. The source from northern Jiangsu has arrived: 350 bales of Tonghua cotton, 697 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 484 bales of Beisha cotton. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was closed yesterday for Thanksgiving, but according to a telegram from a certain bank, it is predicted that the market price will rise slightly by 3 or 4 pounds. The Indian cotton market continues to rise sharply. The highest price of white block in April and May reached 260 Robbie. Subsequently, due to most bulls taking profits, the market situation turned weary. As a result, the closing price, including the forecast, fell by 14 Robbie. Egypt then rose by another 40 to 50 pounds. Liverpool spot rose by more than 10 pence, and forward fell by more than 10 pence.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transaction: Yesterday, Shenxin Factory slightly increased its appetite again, and its raw materials were still mainly for spinning 20 counts. Traders also slightly purchased, but they were all long-fiber. Japanese manufacturers imported American cotton more strongly than Chinese factories. There were transactions of several thousand bales a day. The cotton market yesterday, converted at an American exchange rate of 8 yuan and 4.375, is listed below as the price including tax delivered to the factory.

### Indian Cotton Shows Signs of Retreat; Cotton Yarn Buyers Lack Strength

The yarn market, which rose sharply the previous day, entered a rotating path yesterday. In fact, the US cotton market was closed, and the Bombay cotton market had been soaring for days, showing signs of retreat. The telegram predicted that today's prices for both coarse and fine cotton would fall by 10 Robbie. Thus, people's minds became relaxed again, and the buying momentum was not as strong as it used to be. At the same time, although the demand from Hong Kong merchants did not stop, the purchases were all retail transactions, and there was no news of wholesale development. Therefore, the rising momentum failed to maintain progress. Only because the cotton market could not be hoped to be loose, the foundation of the yarn market could always be consolidated.

The morning opening of the yarn market was moderate. Because foreign cotton was feared to have a retreat, the buying mood was not strong. The opening price did not move. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 652 yuan, which was no different from the previous day. It was heard that the foreign exchange had changed very little, and the Guangbang lacked transactions for 20-count yarn, but the appetite for 10-count coarse yarn was always trying. Therefore, 20-count Double Horse was slightly weak, falling by 3 yuan and breaking the 50 yuan mark. By the time of closing, it slightly improved. It was found that the various gangs had bought 1,685 bales in half a day, and the market was uneven compared with the previous day. Tongyi Factory opened 200 bales of 23-count Dafa at a price of 635 yuan, and Defeng Factory opened 100 bales of 17-count Gold Double Lion at a price of 595 yuan, all cash prices. The amount of each gang's mouth purchase is as follows:

### Food: Rice Prices Are Difficult to Loosen; Tightening Again After Loosening; Foreign Rice Has Arrived and is Available

The rice market was weak yesterday morning. The sources continued to arrive from various directions, including 34 to 5 cars of goods from Sujia Kuntong, and more than 2,000 bags of goods transported from Huxipu to Changbang. This caused people's minds to be weak. In addition, the foreign rice that was ordered had been transported from Hong Kong to 10,000 bags and was thrown on the market, and the impact was most restricted by the customer point. The hoarders searched and handled, considering that the customer point price was the cheapest at that time, and the market goods were lightly allowed, and they considered it to be more stable than other goods, and they were quite optimistic. Therefore, the stockpiled customer point was the most, and now the market has depreciated for days. The hope has been broken, and it has been hit by foreign rice. They all endured the pain and continued to compete to get rid of it. Therefore, the customer point price in the early market fell by nearly yuan. However, because the retail sales market was still not smooth, it continued to depreciate. Until the middle market, it reached about one and a half yuan, and the Jingwu point was weaker than the Jiangbei point. The special goods were priced at about 30 yuan, and the market goods were at 29 and a half yuan. As for thick and thin rice and Luyang point, the situation was also poor at this time, and the transaction was clear, following the footsteps of the customer point. The market was reduced by 70 to 80 cents. Although the arrival of Bianyin Yuan was not prosperous, the wineries and snack shops, rice carriers, etc. saw that the rice price was going downstream, and they all looked forward and dared not enter much. The way out was the most astringent, and the price fell sharply by about 2 yuan. At that time, the overall market was extremely tired, but the market changes were the most unpredictable. In a moment, the general customers considered that the glutinous price seemed to have fallen through, and they suddenly started again and took advantage of the cheap price to handle it. For a time, they asked each other, and the situation turned from tired to tight. Whether it was the local town or the stomach, they were all active. Under the shouting of the sellers, the market for thick glutinous rice and Luyang point immediately rebounded. Therefore, the result was first tired and then tight, which can be called a standard. The closing market was often true special glutinous rice 36 yuan, special glutinous rice 35 yuan, Sukun white glutinous rice 33 and a half yuan, 323 yuan, 289 yuan for those with water stains, Luyang point 312 yuan, the market for the rest, such as thin rice and customer point Bianyin Yuan, etc., also seemed tight, but the market was still half a yuan to one yuan cheaper than the previous market. As for foreign rice, because it was fresh when it first arrived, the sales market was quite prosperous, and 800 bags of long grains were opened, and 2,000 bags of round grains came. The round grain Annam glutinous rice was 31 and a half yuan, 31 yuan, and the long grain Saigon was 30 yuan, 5 jiao, 30 yuan. The total transaction in the city was more than 8,000 bags.

The price of foreign rice refuses to loosen, and new transactions are difficult to approach. However, the price of glutinous rice has been downstream for days, and it is difficult for the foreign rice spot market to stand firm. Yesterday, 2,693 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, which were transported from Hong Kong by Taikoo Company's Hunan ship. It is heard that the foreign rice was purchased by the Beiyang gang, and 2,440 bags were transported to Yantai, and 250 bags were transported to Weihaiwei, and will be transferred to the ship next Monday.

### Oil Market: Oil Merchants Are Crazy; Oil Prices Are Raised Every Day; Unwilling to Cause Public Suffering

Recently, soybean oil and peanut oil have created an unprecedentedly high market price. Although there is also an impact of poor sources, the manipulated components are more. The actual sales in the market do not seem to be so eager to collect. Most of the huge daily transaction volume is the same industry buying and selling each other, raising the market price, taking risks, and ignoring the pain of the public to raise to a level of one yuan in national currency for one catty of oil. How crazy and harmful is this? Yesterday, a new high point was built up again. 40 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were opened, and the price was raised from 85 yuan to 86 yuan and 5 jiao. 30 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were priced at 83 yuan and 5 jiao to 84 yuan. 50 pieces of Yanqi oil were priced at 63 yuan and 5 jiao. 700 cans of Yantai canned peanut oil were priced at 81 yuan to 81 yuan and 5 jiao. 500 cans of Jiangbei canned raw oil were priced at 81 yuan and 5 jiao to 80 yuan. In addition, 20 barrels of canned raw oil were priced at 81 yuan. Except for the canned oil, which was handled by this street, the rest were purchased by the Hong Kong gangs. It is estimated that 2,085 cans and 150 pieces of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### HSBC and Other Banks Transport 10 Million Yuan in Legal Tender to Shanghai; All Safely Unloaded After Import; False Plans to Obstruct Have Failed; The Central Bank Urges the Speedy Transport of Subsidiary Coins and Notes

After Li Jiannan, the false "Jianghai Customs Superintendent," attempted to prevent the transport of Chinese legal tender to Shanghai, the foreign banks firmly opposed it and ignored it. Therefore, Chinese legal tender can be transported to Shanghai as usual to replenish the supply. The amount of legal tender stored in Shanghai is abundant, sufficient for market circulation. It is also heard that a total of 10 million yuan in legal tender was recently transported to Shanghai, belonging to British HSBC and other banks. All were safely unloaded after import and did not encounter any obstruction from any party. Therefore, there is no concern about the lack of circulation of legal tender in the Shanghai concession area. Since the obstruction of the transport of legal tender to Shanghai has not materialized, it has little to do with the prosperity and decline of Shanghai's foreign exchange market and there is no reason to weaken the exchange market.

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Regulation of Jiao Tickets

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, according to the Suzhou Satin Group of the Silk and Satin Industry Association, stated that there is a shortage of jiao tickets recently, making it inconvenient to purchase daily necessities and affecting social livelihoods. It is proposed to request the Central Bank to issue a sufficient amount of jiao tickets from the treasury and increase printing to facilitate the market. This has been forwarded to the Central Bank for consideration. A reporter from the New Sound Agency learned from the bank yesterday that the subsidiary coins and notes issued by the Central, China, Communications, Agricultural, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Agricultural Banks in Shanghai, divided into five jiao, two jiao five fen, two jiao, one jiao, and four types, are quite large in number and sufficient for market circulation. It is said that the two jiao and one jiao issued by the Central Bank and published by the Zhonghua Book Company are the most numerous.

Shortage Panic Can Be Relieved

Recently, due to the completion of the issuance of the stored inventory, it was necessary to temporarily suspend the issuance, resulting in a sudden shortage in the market. It is heard that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has requested the head office to transport the printed subsidiary coins and notes to Shanghai for regulation. Once they arrive in Shanghai, they will be issued by the branch. Therefore, the panic of the shortage of subsidiary coins and notes will be relieved soon. The one fen and five fen coins and notes have been contracted to be printed by the American Yongning Company. After the printing is completed and delivered to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, an official announcement will be issued.

### Overseas Chinese Employees Resign One After Another; Salaries Reduced by One-Third; Unable to Manage Side Businesses

According to news from the shipping industry, among the overseas Chinese serving on foreign merchant ships, the Chinese employees on foreign ships traveling on the Pacific route are the most numerous. Since the outbreak of the European War, the relevant shipping companies have tightened their expenses, resulting in a large reduction in wages. In the past, the average monthly salary of Chinese employees on British and French postal ships was 30 to 50 Hong Kong dollars, and they could also engage in other side businesses, such as small businesses. However, after the war, due to the tightening of expenses, the salaries of the employees have been reduced by one-third. In addition, there is no security guarantee for navigation, and there is no way to manage side businesses. Therefore, most employees are forced to resign voluntarily. Recently, when the French postal ship Adete Dingpeng sailed from France to Shanghai, more than 30 Chinese employees resigned to the shipping company in Hong Kong. They were all from Guangdong and had served as tea servants on the ship for many years. They have landed in Hong Kong and returned to their hometowns.

### The 37th Day Anniversary of Ma Xiangbo's Death Was Held Yesterday; Memorial Service; About 500 Guests and Family Members Attended; The 57th Day Anniversary is Planned to Be Held, Location Undetermined

Yesterday was the 37th day anniversary of the death of the centenarian Ma Xiangbo. Ma's relatives, friends, and Catholic believers held a 37th day memorial mass at St. Joseph's Catholic Church on Catholic Church Street in the French Concession at 7:30 AM yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:

The 57th Day Memorial is Being Planned

At 7:30 AM, Ma's nephews Zhu Zhiyao and Zhu Jilin, great-grandchildren Zhang Chongren and his wife, and Catholic believers He Lizhong, Liu Changyin, Wang Baolun, Zhu Luyi, and other guests, including Pu Qiting, and other 500 people had gathered in Joseph's Church in the Catholic Church. Most of the students of Louis School, organized by the Catholic Church, also participated. When entering the church, a portrait of Ma with a black border and white background was distributed to the participants, inscribed with "The Holy Lord Grants Him Eternal Peace and Illuminates Him with Eternal Light," and "Holy Name Joseph," and adding the explanation: "Centenarian Ma Gong Xiangbo returned to the Lord on November 4th of the 28th year of the Republic of China. November 24, 1939, 7:30 AM, Yangjingbang Joseph's Church 37th Day Memorial Mass Ceremony Commemoration."

The Memorial Mass Was Solemn and Grand

The Joseph's Church was solemnly and solemnly arranged, with a memorial platform placed in the center, surrounded by dozens of white torches. All the ceremonies were similar to those held at St. Peter's Church on Luban Road. The main celebrant was Father Zhang Duanliu, the principal of Xuhui Middle School, and the co-celebrants were Father Song Joseph and Father Wang Fang of the Catholic Church. The participants were students of Louis School. The music was led and played by Zhu Xisheng, a famous Catholic musician, and the choir was also composed of Louis students. This memorial mass was a five-six grand ceremony, so it was quite grand. In addition to chanting scriptures and praying, the Holy Communion ceremony was held. The ceremony ended at 8:20 AM.

The 57th Day Memorial is Being Planned

According to Father Zhang, the principal of Xuhui Middle School, after the death of Ma Gong Xiangbo, people from all walks of life in Shanghai and Catholic believers have launched a series of memorial activities. The Shanghai Catholic Action Association, in accordance with Catholic etiquette, has held mass ceremonies on the "Third Day," "First Seven," and "Thirty-Seventh Days" calculated from the date of death for the sake of transcending. Our school, in addition to holding a memorial on the Third Day, also held a ceremony by the school board on the 27th Day. According to Catholic etiquette, the thirtieth day after death is also an important memorial period. The Catholic Action Association may hold a memorial ceremony again on the 57th Day, but because the churches in Shanghai have held them one after another, the location is yet to be determined. Our school is the first school that Xiang Lao entered in his childhood. Recently, dozens of years ago, we found the student award records. During the Qing Xianfeng 7th year, Xiang Lao won the first place in the Western Language Award and continued for three years. This shows that Xiang Lao was diligent and studious in his childhood. Now our school has properly preserved the records for permanent commemoration.

### Tribute Rice Arrives Yesterday; Another 1,500 Tons Agreed Upon Via Telegraph; Rice Market Weak, Unable to Recover, Prices Falling Daily

The recent surge in rice prices has significantly impacted the livelihoods of citizens. Due to the increasing supply of national rice, market conditions continue to weaken. Tribute rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, and public sentiment is bearish. The Rice Merchants Association Tea Party and Market Management Committee are not only trying to lower rice prices but also thoroughly investigating speculators. The Brokers Association has issued a notice to comply with regulations and refrain from privately raising prices. Yesterday, the rice market remained weak, unable to recover, and prices fell by about one yuan. Detailed information follows:

Arrival of Tribute Rice

The Saigon authorities had previously banned rice exports, leading to the cessation of joint purchases of foreign rice by various groups and organizations in the city. The Saigon authorities have now lifted the ban, allowing rice exports. Shanghai rice merchants have jointly purchased tribute rice, and deals continue to be made. It is reported that 1,500 tons, equivalent to 15,000 bags, were agreed upon via telegraph yesterday. Rice industry sources revealed that the previously agreed upon 2,400 tons have already been loaded onto ships and set sail. 10,000 bags arrived yesterday and have already been unloaded and entered the warehouse for trading.

Committee Investigation

The Rice Merchants Association Tea Party and Market Management Committee is responsible for assessing market prices and maintaining order. All merchant representatives entering and exiting the market each day must present an entry permit issued by the committee. Market trading rules have been established, and committee members are assigned daily to observe market order. Due to the resurgence of speculative practices, which artificially raise market prices, market order has been disrupted, and prices have soared, causing public unease. The committee, in fulfilling its duties, is conducting a thorough investigation of speculators and issuing earnest warnings.

Brokers Association Appeal

The Brokers Association believes that the recent surge in rice prices was sudden and unexpected. They believe that someone is taking advantage of the situation to enrich themselves. The association feels obligated to act and recently held a meeting to issue a notice to all members to comply with market regulations and avoid speculative buying and selling to protect the people's food supply. The notice is recorded as follows: "Recently, due to market price chaos, the association, to maintain order, has decided to notify all members that they must strictly comply with market rules and not raise prices to protect the people's food supply. This is hereby notified."

### Japanese Soldiers Break into British Residence at Night; Rude Search Conducted; British Consulate to Protest

Mr. Santos, a British employee of the Da Mei Printing Factory, residing at 24, Lane 506, North Szechuan Road, was awakened at 3:00 AM by six Japanese Marine patrolmen who broke down his door with their rifle butts to search the premises. Mr. Santos, his wife, and his children were all startled from their sleep and arose to investigate. They saw six Japanese Marines, each holding a rifle with a bayonet fixed, standing at the door. Two of them entered the house and asked Mr. Santos who he was. Mr. Santos immediately presented his British passport to one of the soldiers and stated that he and his family were British citizens. However, the Marines did not examine the passport and threw it back at him. They then conducted a thorough search of the house, turning over clothes and bedding. Mr. Santos protested, but to no avail. Afterward, Mr. Santos reported the incident to the British Consulate General. The British Consulate is expected to lodge a protest with the Japanese Consulate.

### Detailed Record of International Airmail Rates and Delivery Costs

The Shanghai Postal Administration, in response to the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates and to compensate for losses in international postage, increased all rates, including regular mail, registered mail, and airmail, by 100% starting September 1st. The rate for regular mail, originally 25 cents for every 20 grams, was increased to 50 cents. For every 20 grams exceeding that weight, an additional 30 cents was added. The registration fee was also increased from 25 cents to 50 cents. Airmail rates were also doubled across the board. After this had been in effect for a short time, the Shanghai Postal Administration received a notice from the Hong Kong Post Office that airmail rates to various parts of Southeast Asia would need to be increased again. Therefore, on the 20th of this month, international airmail rates were re-priced, leading to considerable confusion among the public. In addition, the airmail rates quoted by different postal clerks varied, leading to complaints to the post office. An investigation has been conducted, and the airmail rates for Royal, Franco-Chinese, and Sino-American airlines are detailed as follows:

Royal Airmail Rates

Royal Airlines, departing from Hong Kong, English name Imperial Airline, abbreviated as I. A. L. The rates to various overseas Southeast Asian destinations are calculated in units of 5 grams each. For example, to send mail to Hanoi, the airmail fee is $1.30 per 5 grams, plus the regular mail fee of 50 cents, totaling $1.80. Registration requires an additional registration fee of 50 cents. If the weight exceeds 25 grams, the airmail fee is multiplied by five ($6.50), plus the regular mail fee of 80 cents, because regular mail is 50 cents for every 20 grams, and for every 20 grams exceeding that, the regular mail fee is doubled and an additional 30 cents is added. Airmail rates to various parts of Southeast Asia via Royal Airlines are more expensive than Franco-Chinese Airlines, but the speed is similar. Rates to other regions vary. To Hanoi, Indochina, Saigon, Indochina, the Philippines, Siam, Burma (Rangoon, etc.), Malaya (Singapore, etc.), British India, India (Bombay, Calcutta), Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Cairo, and Egypt, the rate is $1.30 per 5 grams. To European countries, it is $1.75 per 5 grams. To the Gold Coast, Portuguese East Africa, Nigeria, Nyasaland, the Union of South Africa, and Southwest Africa, it is $3.40 per 5 grams. To Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and the islands of the Western Pacific, it is also $1.30 per 5 grams.

Franco-Chinese Airmail Rates

Franco-Chinese Airlines, English name Air France, abbreviated as A. F. There are two departure points, Hong Kong and Hanoi. The rate from Hong Kong is 25 cents more expensive per 5 grams than from Hanoi. The following rates are calculated from Hong Kong departures. To calculate the rate from Hanoi, simply subtract 25 cents per 5 grams. From Hong Kong to Hanoi, Indochina, it is 25 cents per 5 grams; to Saigon, Indochina, 60 cents; to Siam, Burma (Rangoon, etc.), Malaya, Singapore, 70 cents; to British India, India (Bombay, Calcutta), 90 cents; to Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Cairo, and Egypt, $1.55; to European countries, $1.00; to Algeria and French Algeria, $2.15; to Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Portuguese East Africa, Nyasaland, the Union of South Africa, and Southwest Africa, all African regions, $3.65; to Australia, $1.55.

Sino-American Airmail Rates

Sino-American Airlines, the Pacific route of American Airlines, P. A. A., also departs from Hong Kong. From Hong Kong to the Philippines, it is 35 cents; to Guam, $1.05; to Hawaii (Honolulu), $2.40; to the United States (U.S.A.), $3.75; to Canada, Mexico, Newfoundland, $4.45; to Saint Martin, Saba, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, El Salvador, the Windward Islands, etc., $4.80; to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, etc., $6.50. In addition to departures from Hong Kong, there is also transport by ship to the United States, with departures from San Francisco to destinations within the United States (U. S. Air Service From San Francisco), which is cheaper. From San Francisco to the United States, it is 65 cents per 5 grams; to Canada, Mexico, 70 cents; to Saint Martin, Saba, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, El Salvador, the Windward Islands, etc., $1.05; to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Ecuador, etc., $2.75. Whether Royal, Franco-Chinese, or Sino-American airlines are used, the airmail rate for postcards is the same as for letters, only the regular mail fee is different. Although Franco-Chinese Airlines can reach the interior of the United States, it is far less convenient than Sino-American Airlines, so it is omitted here. The rate for Sino-Japanese airmail is 35 cents for every 20 grams, plus a regular mail fee of 5 cents, totaling 40 cents. For each additional increment in weight, an additional 40 cents is added. Postcards are 18 cents. Printed matter is 75 cents for every 60 grams.

### Chinese Regular Army Enters Central China; Inflicts Repeated Defeats on Puppet Troops; Japanese Newspaper Details Events

According to the English-language "Great Shanghai Evening Post," a Japanese newspaper reports that the Chinese government, in an attempt to disrupt the establishment of a "New Central Regime" and harass the rear of the Japanese army, ordered the 62nd Division, 30th Division, and New Fourth Army to enter Central China in early November. Since November 8th, these units have been in constant combat with Japanese garrisons in Anqing, Wuhu, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other areas. Near Anqing, guerilla artillery units attempted to cut off Yangtze River traffic. East of the Jinpu Railway in eastern Anhui, near Zilaiqiao and Lai'an, the New Fourth Army and Japanese troops have repeatedly clashed, resulting in casualties on both sides.

### Over Thirty Repatriated Overseas Chinese Depart Shanghai in Second Group

Over one hundred and fifty unemployed Chinese from Zhejiang Province, repatriated from France and the Netherlands, finding no suitable employment in Shanghai, have decided to return to their native place in groups. The first group of seventy-nine people departed some days ago aboard the Italian company’s “Cang Sai” ship for Zhenhai, then headed to Ningbo to return home. Now, a second group of over thirty people also separately boarded the "Flying Kang" ship of the Lu Ling foreign firm and the "Hana" ship of the Far East company yesterday and today to go to Zhenhai and return home. The remaining personnel are still awaiting ships in Shanghai.

### Illegal Patrols by Puppet Police on Anhe Temple Road; Municipal Police Have Already Retreated; Awaiting Group of Consuls to Issue Protest; Two Arrested Chinese Police Officers Held by Puppet Court

Police jurisdiction over Anhe Temple Road, Columbia Road, and Haig Road in the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads area has traditionally been under the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which stationed police officers there. Recently, for the past week, the defense of the area has been taken over by a large number of puppet police officers dispatched by the armed police brigade of the puppet Fahua Township, stationed at various checkpoints. More than ten puppet police officers, armed, also guard the corner of Columbia Road and Anhe Temple Road and the bus stops of the two roads. The situation is extremely serious. To avoid unnecessary conflict, the British Municipal Council has withdrawn its police officers from the area, awaiting the group of consuls to protest to the puppet municipal government.

Arrested Chinese Police Officers

Some days ago, municipal police officers of the Public Concession were patrolling the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads and were provoked into conflict with "police" of the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government." The Western police officers have escaped safely, but two Chinese police officers, along with their weapons, were abducted. There has been no news from outside. It is understood that after the puppet "police" abducted the two Chinese police officers, they handed them over to the Japanese Military Police in Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads.

Subjected to Interrogation

Now, the Japanese Military Police have identified the two Chinese police officers as criminal offenders and, on the 23rd of this month, handed them over to the newly established puppet "Local Branch Court" inside Datong University on Zhongshan Road in the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads area. After the puppet "prosecutor" held a court hearing, they were all imprisoned separately, and it is not known what "laws" they will be charged with.

### Japanese Troops Withdraw From Baoshan Road Intersection; Japanese Troops Still Patrol From Time to Time

The Japanese sentry post at the intersection of Baoshan Road in Zhabei, which originally had two soldiers stationed there, has recently been reduced to one. Pedestrians passing through that place had to be inspected. When the reporter passed through that place at 5:00 PM yesterday, they saw that the Japanese sentry post had been completely removed and pedestrians could pass without being inspected. However, the British army sentry post in the concession remains at the intersection at the end of North Henan Road. Although the Japanese sentry post has been removed, Japanese patrol teams on motorcycles frequently patrol the Baoshan Road and Xinmin Road area. At the Japanese sentry post on North Jiangxi Road, inspections of passing Chinese pedestrians are still very strict. At the breach in Haining Road, in addition to strictly inspecting pedestrians, if they see Chinese people gathered at the corner of Shanghai Telephone Company diagonally opposite their sentry post, they will take a wooden stick and drive them away. Those who are slow to leave will be beaten.

### Housing in District A of North Jiangxi Road Suddenly Searched; Japanese Marines Swarm In; Search Yields Nothing

The situation inside the iron fence along North Jiangxi Road has been relatively peaceful recently. However, yesterday afternoon, a large group of Japanese Marine soldiers, carrying weapons, swarmed into the area. First, they searched the East Taihua Lane house by house. The residents of Dong Dexing Lane, Huale Lane, and Fanzhi Lane were also subjected to the same search. The breaches at Haining Road and Wenjianshi Road in the district have also been suddenly closed early since the night before. Residents are also not allowed to move, creating an atmosphere of panic.

### Japanese Troops Land in Beihai; Intended to Cut Off the Long-Yong Road

— Min

By John Ahlers, Translated from the “China Press”

The Domei [Japanese] news service has released the first decisive news that Japanese forces have landed in Dongjing Bay in Guangdong province, saying that the aim of this decisive action is simply to occupy Beihai and seal off the "Free China's" foreign trade from that port. Later, when Japanese forces advanced inland from the Qinzhou area, the Japanese side suggested that they would invade Guangxi from the south, but judging from the sudden deployment of Japanese forces in southwestern Guangdong, the intensity of the Japanese land battles, and the traffic situation, it can be seen that the Japanese forces are pursuing goals with more far-reaching implications than the Japanese side acknowledges. The Japanese forces appear to be aiming to inflict a blow on the Chinese side, the importance of which is comparable to the occupation of Guangzhou and the severing of one of the vital transportation lines connecting "Free China" with the outside world. The true objective of the Japanese forces appears to be to block the Longzhou-to-Yongning highway and, if possible, to occupy that highway.

In the earlier months of this year, Beihai was the most important export port for "Free China." More metals and products were shipped from Beihai to Hong Kong than from any other port along the South China coast, and imports through Beihai were also substantial. However, as the threat from the Japanese forces on Leizhou Island increased, the Chinese authorities shifted most of Beihai trade to other ports, especially Fort Bayard in the French concession of Guangzhou Bay. Furthermore, the Chinese authorities evacuated part of the residents of Beihai, destroyed some of the facilities and equipment in the port, and most of the roads leading inland. In September, shipping traffic in Beihai was reduced to six ships with a total of 11,249 tons, and Beihai's foreign trade also decreased, with exports valued at 836,530 yuan and imports valued at 67,685 gold units. In September, Beihai accounted for only 10 percent of "Free China's" exports and 1.5 percent of imports. The import of war supplies through Beihai has recently ceased completely.

With the exception of money orders, which are temporarily suspended, registered mail, express mail, and regular mail have all resumed.

### Evil Arts Used to Defraud a Huge Sum; Astrologer Yang Qiaomin Sentenced to Five Years; Required to Compensate the Plaintiff Over Sixty Thousand Yuan

Yang Qiaomin (also known as Le Tian, or Di An), from Wuxi, claiming to be proficient in astrology, recently used his astrological skills to defraud Shi Kongyu of Ningbo out of over 76,000 yuan. After the case was reported, Chief Inspector Jiang Shangpei and Yang Peisheng of the General Police Station arrested Yang and handed him over to the First Special Court, where the police attorney Qian Gouji prosecuted him according to law. Shi Kongyu also hired attorneys Wu Linkun and Xiao Baichuan to file a civil suit, requesting compensation for the defrauded funds. After a clear hearing and confession by the Special Court, Judge Dai Rongduo ascended the Criminal Court No. 4 yesterday morning and announced the verdict. The main text of the verdict reads: Yang Qiaomin is sentenced to five years of imprisonment for repeatedly defrauding people into handing over their property through fraudulent means. The defendant shall compensate the plaintiff in the related civil lawsuit with 68,466 yuan and 4 jiao (cents). The seized ghost money, tin cans, and stamps shall be confiscated.

### The Dark Side of Society: The Miserable Plight of Orphans

Zhao Fengying: The girl Zhao Fengying, aged eleven, from Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, got lost at approximately 11:30 AM the day before yesterday near Wuchang Road on Broadway. After being discovered by the police, she was transferred by the police station to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Section for disposition. According to the child's own account, her biological mother abandoned her, the only child, when she was just three years old, eloping with her lover and disappearing without a trace. There has been no news for many years. Since her mother's departure, the girl has relied solely on her grandmother for survival. Her father, due to poverty, came to Shanghai alone to work in a factory in Pudong. However, in recent years, not only has he not sent any money home, but he has also completely cut off contact, causing the girl and her grandmother deep anxiety. Recently, a fellow villager named Huang Kecheng came to Shanghai, and the girl obtained her grandmother's consent to accompany Huang to Shanghai in an attempt to find her father. However, upon arriving in Shanghai and going to Pudong to search for her father, she found no trace of him. Huang returned to his hometown after finishing his business, entrusting the girl to the care of a friend's family. However, due to the poverty of that family, there was a constant threat of starvation, and the girl was forced to run away on her own, ending up on the streets and begging passersby for a living. The Child Protection Section, considering the girl's pitiful circumstances, has placed her in the Children's Home of the Catholic Orphanage Association. According to reports, the girl still longs to find her father in the orphanage, washing her face with tears every day, hoping that her father will come forward to claim her, so as to fulfill her wish for family reunion.

Zhao Baoshan: The boy Zhao Baoshan, aged nine, from Anhui Province, originally lived with his father on Avenue Bagneux, French Concession. His father, Zhao Yugui, aged forty-five, due to domestic poverty, made a living by selling erotic pictures. Every day at 5:00 PM, Zhao Yugui would instruct his son to go out with him, carrying several bundles of erotic pictures, which his son would hold, while Yugui solicited customers on the street. Recently, while soliciting in the International Settlement, they were discovered by the police, who arrested both father and son and brought them to court for trial. Zhao Yugui was sentenced to imprisonment, and the child Baoshan, being under the age of fourteen, was ordered to be sent to a children's educational institution for foster care. It is now reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Section has sent the child to the Children's Home of the Catholic Orphanage Association for education and upbringing. At the same time, according to the investigation by the Protection Section, since the child's father was imprisoned, the child's mother (Zhao, aged thirty-five) has disappeared without a trace. Therefore, the child has now become a miserable orphan with a father but no mother, which is truly heartbreaking.

### Major Opium Den in Hengmao Lane: Criminals Convicted and Punished; Sixty-Four Male and Female Offenders Sentenced Separately; Principal Offender in Fenyang Lane Opium Trafficking Case Sentenced

The gangster Wu Wanliang (nicknamed "Big Monk"), in collusion with a Korean named Kim, established a morphine smoking establishment in the kitchen of No. 15 Hengmao Lane, Eight Immortals Bridge, French Concession. On the 6th of this month, the establishment was raided by the French Concession police, who seized a large quantity of drugs. The arrested Korean, Kim, was handed over to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation. The accomplices of the establishment, Zhou Tiansheng, Gao Wanyuan, the sublessor Chen Manchao, and sixty-four male and female opium users, including Chen Guoliang and Chen Wangshi, were all brought before the Second Special Court for prosecution in accordance with the law. After interrogation by Judge Zhang Minsheng, the sentences were pronounced yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Zhou Tiansheng, a habitual offender for assisting in running the opium den, was sentenced to four years of imprisonment. Gao Wanyuan was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment. Chen Manchao was also found to have assisted in the operation and was also sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment. As for the sixty-four male and female opium users, including Chen Guoliang and Chen Wangshi, they were all sentenced to imprisonment ranging from three to five months. The principal offender, Big Monk, is currently being pursued by the police.

On June 16th of this year, the Chinese detectives of the Anti-Narcotics Department of the General Police Station raided an opium trafficking establishment at No. 14 Fenyang Lane, Avenue Foch, and arrested multiple suspects, including Zai Rongshen, who were sent to the First Special Court. It was learned that the establishment was jointly operated by four Chaozhou natives: Weng Fan Ting (also known as Weng Hongxiang, also known as Weng Ajiu), Zhou Ruoting, Wu Pan, and Zhang Chaoyuan. Currently, Weng and others are still at large. In addition to sentencing Zai Rongshen and others, warrants have been issued to apprehend the four fugitive shareholders. On the 7th of this month, Weng Fan Ting was finally apprehended at the intersection of Hubei Road on the Fourth Avenue and brought before the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin presided over the final interrogation in the Second Criminal Court and sentenced Weng Fan Ting (also known as Weng Hongxiang, also known as Weng Ajiu) to five years of imprisonment for jointly selling opium, with deprivation of public rights for five years.

### Korean Man Beaten in Xinzha Road: Gangsters Demand Protection Money and Bear a Grudge

According to the China News Agency, yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM near Maybel Road on Xinzha Road, a young man in a Western suit was riding in a rickshaw, traveling from east to west at a rapid pace. Suddenly, several thugs emerged from the roadside, dragged the young man from the rickshaw, and subjected him to a barrage of punches and kicks, striking his head violently with wooden clubs. The young man's head was immediately broken and bleeding profusely. The assailants then fled in a chaotic rush. The police on patrol carried the young man into the Xinzha Police Station and transferred him to a hospital for treatment. The police have dispatched detectives to the scene to investigate. It is reported that the young man is not Chinese but Korean, and he runs a morphine trafficking establishment somewhere. Nearby gangsters demanded protection money but were refused, leading to a grudge and this act of revenge.

### Social Miscellany

Qiu Qilang, a 23-year-old man from Chongming, is currently employed as a worker at the Xie Da Enamel Factory at No. 25 Jinjia Lane, at the end of Xinzha Road, International Settlement. Yesterday morning around 4:30 AM, Qiu was working when he inadvertently fell into a magnetic powder grinding machine and was pulled into the roller, crushing his head, resulting in a bloody mess and instant death.

Liang Asan, a 50-year-old man from Tongzhou, worked as a gatekeeper for Renji Road Real Estate Company. Last night, while having dinner at home, he drank a large amount of sorghum liquor. At 8:00 PM, he went to the company to relieve the previous shift. Due to the excessive alcohol consumption, Liang became delirious and lost his mind. Upon arriving at the company, he went straight to the iron gate of the elevator on the third floor. Liang automatically opened the iron gate, intending to take the elevator to the fourth floor. However, the company's elevator was stopped on the fifth floor. Liang panicked and lost his footing, falling from the third floor to the bottom level, crushing his skull and dying instantly.

Mao Chenshi, a 20-year-old woman from Ningbo, worked as a maid at No. 40 Model Village, Avenue Foch. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, she was ordered by her employer to go out shopping. While crossing the road, she was suddenly struck by a delivery car from the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, suffering severe abdominal injuries. She was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but her life is in critical condition.

### Brief News

Regarding the news reported yesterday about the police offering a reward for the arrest of a murderer, which stated "a male corpse was found," the police have now notified us that it was actually a female corpse. This correction is hereby made.

A certain milk booth in this city needs several milk delivery workers, who must be honest, hard-working, able to ride a bicycle, familiar with the routes, and have a substantial shop as guarantor to be qualified. The salary is excellent. Please contact the Vocational Guidance Department of the YMCA on Sichuan Road every morning.

Dr. Zhang Xiaxiong, a Harvard Medical School graduate and a member of the British Royal Society of Tropical Medicine, has recently moved his residential clinic to No. 77, Lane 864, McTaggart Road. The Nanjing Road clinic is still located in the building of the Liji Pharmacy.

Dr. Zhong Dezhai, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, has been practicing in Xinxishi Town, Huzhou, and is renowned in western Zhejiang. Now, fellow villagers of Huzhou and friends of Dr. Zhong have urged him to practice in Shanghai. Therefore, he has established a clinic at No. 584 Wuding Lane, Wuding Road.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor: It is said that the Mao Yuan Yongji Shaoxing Wine Shop claims that on the evening of the 18th of this month, five or six customers, including Wang Amao and Zhang Jiale, came to the shop for a banquet and summoned hostess to serve drinks. Around 11:00 PM, the guests were all tipsy, and for some unknown reason, they started fighting, with bowls and plates flying across the table, scattering shards all over the floor. The staff tried to stop them in vain, and then ordered compensation. However, the customers were aggressive, and the staff had no choice but to call the police officer No. 3048, and the commotion subsided. Because they refused to pay compensation, they asked that the troublemakers be taken to the police station, but the police officer turned a blind eye and left. The incident was reported to the police station and reported in the newspapers the next day. Later, Wang Amao and others realized they were in the wrong and asked someone to mediate, and voluntarily paid compensation. But I read in the Shenbao that Zhang Jiale's correction letter stated that the shop owner had spoken rudely and offended the customers, denied having a hostess serving drinks, and that the shop knew it was in the wrong. This is just an attempt to cover up the truth. In order to uphold the reputation of our shop, we hereby entrust a special letter to make a correction and clarify the truth. Please check and make the correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Zhang Shibeng, November 23rd.

To the Editor: I was shocked to read the news in your newspaper on the 20th that Wang Shengquan's daughter was scalded in the lower body and died. I thought to myself that although I have a daughter, she is only a few years old. How could such a young child be married? Moreover, Wu's Wooden Bridge is located in a desolate area with no houses and even fewer residents. I am a tailor with a poor family and no thieves have ever visited my house. Therefore, everything in the report is completely fabricated. I am afraid of causing confusion, so I request a correction. Sincerely, Wang Shengquan, a villager from Qibao Town.

### Weather Report

Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: Sunny and cold around Shandong, with northwest to north winds. Cloudy and cold here and in the East China Sea, with fog in the morning and northwest to northeast winds. Bad weather around southern Taiwan. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this city reached a high of 64.4 degrees and a low of 74.3 degrees. On the same day last year, the high was 58.8 degrees and the low was 42.6 degrees.

Lost Official Document Briefcase: The day before yesterday, it was raining heavily. I passed by Wuma Road on business and hired a rickshaw to return to my residence. I found an official document briefcase on the rickshaw. I suppose it was lost due to the hasty action caused by the rain. I immediately reported to the Chinese police near the Zhejiang Grand Theater, who took the official document briefcase and the rickshaw driver to the police station. I am using a corner of this publication to publish a notice of lost property. Please go to the police station to claim it. (Wang Fenggang)

### Loss and Gain

— Mu Chang

"To take a loss is to gain, to gain is to take a loss" is truly a wonderful saying, its utility often exceeding "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form." In fact, everyone has a desire for gain, but seeking loss and failing to find it is the world's greatest injustice. To truly want gain, with loss as a major premise, is naturally a "good essay." However, gain is also scarce in the world, and you avoid loss as if it were a sworn enemy, fearing you won't be fast enough. If you have the ambition to seek gain but lack the talent to avoid loss, then what you get is mostly unsatisfactory, regardless of whether it is "obvious" or "hidden." Therefore, the philosophy of "unity of loss and gain" was invented, and the above slogan was put forward. And Ah Q is precisely the standard figure of this kind: he gets beaten by others, but says that the other person is his son. At first hearing, it is very laughable, and then it becomes alarming. It turns out that what Ah Q aspires to is also gain, but alas, his strength is not up to the task!

Loss and gain are generally relative. In my contest with the other party, what I get cannot be the same as what the other party gets, unless there is no such thing as competition in the world. However, that world has not yet been produced. Therefore, there is no fear of competition. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, is the best offset. Only the cowardly like Ah Q dare not carry out this "surgery," even though he still claims to be the father.

But taking a step back, the father is not without some demeanor. What is most regrettable is that he becomes someone else's son and still thinks it's glorious. This is truly beyond words.

In this way, the "surgery" is also "talking without getting down to business," and what it relies on is "contagion," which is very easy. For example, if you want to talk about "revolution," you can cite the example of Emperor Qianlong being the young son of Grand Secretary Chen of Hai Ning. Isn't this much more convenient than revolution? Although Emperor Qianlong himself became the son of the "Tartars," the blood cells in the bodies of the later Qing emperors were definitely of the Chen Grand Secretary type. Ugh, "To take a loss is to gain!"

I am very happy with this gain. But throughout history, there have been even greater losses, but naturally even greater gains, which makes me even happier—too happy to be "painful" (!). For example, Miss Wang Zhaojun's marriage to a foreign land. That is truly outrageous! A historical disgrace! Disgrace! But here is where the "essay is." It turns out that if I want to compile a "History of Women's Patriotism," Mulan is listed first, and Miss Wang is second. According to the "chronicle" method, Miss Wang is still the first chapter. And the "Autumn in the Han Palace," which is at the beginning of the Yuan drama selection, thus becomes the best work of national defense (?) literature.

Naturally, some people will be indignant at Emperor Yuan of Han's "giving up his troops and marrying off his daughter" passive method. In the "Plum Blossom Wine" section of "Autumn in the Han Palace," look at his pitiful appearance: "He, he, he (that is, Miss Wang) sadly bids farewell to the Han emperor, I, I, I take hands on the riverbank; his subordinates enter the remote wilderness, my carriage returns to Xianyang... passing the palace wall, circling the corridor; ... near the pepper room, the moon is dim and yellow; ... the night is cool, weeping with cold; the green gauze window, I don't think about it." But his lovelornness is due to Miss Wang's marriage to a foreign land, and the marriage to a foreign land allows the country to "maintain" itself. Ha, "To take a loss is to gain!" We should envy Emperor Yuan of Han for having such a romance and being very patriotic.

But I am also a bit indignant at this "loss." That is naturally Mao Yanshou's unforgivable sin, and Emperor Yuan of Han, in addition to the above-mentioned "gain," does not seem to have asked Miss Wang to take on the job of "female spy," like in the 1940s, when some people sent Miss to put on military uniforms to the distant battlefield to flirt, thus becoming more "active."

However, this was Emperor Yuan of Han's mistake, and it is not mentioned in history, so it is not appropriate to force the people of the Republic of China to bear this indignation, just as it is not necessary to pull Emperor Guangxu to be a Han Chinese.

Here it must be pointed out that it is naturally much more "profitable" for a man to go abroad to recruit a son-in-law than to marry off a daughter, as has always been the case in patriarchal societies. Otherwise, why is Eve one of Adam's ribs? Although it is inevitable to kneel before the "Old Prince" and shout "Dad!" But, think, the world in the future... haha, think, and what else is readily available.

Now is the time to promote "moving history." Of course, it is "not allowed" to turn the emperor into a "president," but if you understand this family secret rich in "××ness" (?), the president may not have the good fortune, but the money for food and clothing will be settled as a result.

So I am going to the beauty salon tomorrow.

### Manifestation of Strength - A Wartime Record -

The strategy of "mopping up" the mountain area has undoubtedly completely failed, and Wanxi remains as solid as a rock. So, the most urgent task at hand is not to mobilize troops, replenish military supplies, or strengthen fortifications, but to urgently transport all kinds of things that should be prepared. Machinery, grain, salt, cloth, paper, etc., are all necessities for a long defense. Because Wuhan has been abandoned, these construction materials and economic data may be cut off. Therefore, it is not enough to deal with future difficulties without sufficient storage, which will weaken the strength of the Dabie Mountains. In other words, the fundamental urgent task is economic first, and military affairs are secondary. General Liao Lei said, "Protecting Jianghuai is protecting Longshu; consolidating the Dabie Mountains is also establishing the foundation for future counterattacks." Until the eve of the death of this brave and good general of the Guangxi Army, he was still earnestly instructing his comrades-in-arms with unshakable and firm convictions. This is how important it is to make people realize the importance of the western Anhui base!

In the season when late autumn disappears and early winter arrives, the Dabie Mountains shed their green coat, revealing the majestic posture of copper tendons and iron bones. The common people put down their shovels and plows to participate in the urgent transportation work. The winding mountain paths and the perilous and steep mountain trails all emit the sound of "Hang Yu Hang Yu," which is so pleasant, so neat, and combined with the flowing water of the creek and the flying waterfalls of the cliffs, forming an extraordinary rhythm, you can't help but feel the greatness of human power.

"Aren't you tired, fellow villagers!" Someone asked the light-footed porters with concern.

"Of course not! I..." He pointed to his broad shoulders and replied, "I, on this... Humph, guess, how many pounds can I put on it?" He said, with a proud smile on his face.

"Eighty pounds? Ninety pounds may be able to carry it?"

"One hundred and twenty pounds!" The young porter said in a drawn-out tone, "If you run a short distance, you have to add more weight!" He added two sentences.

The quantity of grain and salt is increasing day by day. The common people know that this is the "source of life." In the weeks of requisitioning and transporting, they created an unprecedented record with their active posture. And they are particularly motivated to rush to transport salt, because they have tasted the pain of the "encirclement and suppression." It is better to let the rice that is about to be harvested fall in the fields. "This is our white rice."

"Strength, how great!" Zhu Foding, with his gray hair, felt satisfied. He is the dean of Guangxi University, but now, he is shouldering a heavier burden than any porter, pushing the potential of the Dabie Mountains.

### A Little Story About Language

— Zhu Yu

Introduction

This "Language Exhibition" has aroused the attention of many people to language, marking a new boundary in the history of Chinese language. Here I would like to tell a few small stories about language, some with literary interest, some with national sentiment, and only scientific ones are not included. According to Rask, language reflects the cultural activities of various ethnic groups in prehistoric times, such as religion, customs, and institutions; so I hope my "short stories" pay more attention to this.

Adam in Paradise

The "Bible" is the "Book of Books," and my "short stories" should start from here. "In the beginning there was the Word," which is too boring, so put it aside.

Chapter 2 of "Genesis" says that God created the universe in seven days, and then created Adam from dust. The earliest language of mankind is the name of the river (the river is the creator of culture), because the four rivers flowing out of Paradise were the first to be named: the first is called the Pishon River, the second is the Gihon River, the third is the Tigris River, and the fourth is the Euphrates River.

When Adam arrived in Paradise, God taught him the names of all things: "So Adam called each thing, and each thing was named accordingly." This is the beginning of language, which, according to Cambridge University Vice-Chancellor Lightfoot's correct (?) chronology, was around April 25, 4004 BC.

"Adam gave names to all livestock, birds, and beasts; but Adam could not find a companion." God had compassion on him and created Eve. I think why literary works (literature) always talk about love, probably because of this (?).

The Tower of Babel

"Genesis" Chapter 11 begins by saying: "At that time, there was only one language in the world, 'one way of speaking.'" Mankind escaped the flood and came to Shinar, wanting to build a tower whose top would reach Heaven. God saw it and was very angry, saying: "Go and scatter their languages, so that they cannot understand each other."

Because the languages were not the same, the person who wanted bricks could not get bricks, and the person who wanted lime was given a board. The tower could not be built, and from then on mankind lived in various parts of the earth, and the languages were permanently separated.

This Tower of Babel is actually the first tragedy of human language. If there were only one language in the world, the contact between human beings would definitely be closer, and culture would definitely be more developed. Zamenhof created Esperanto, perhaps moved by this story.

The bottom few floors of the Tower of Babel were always built (and collapsed due to disrepair for many years). There, the languages of various ethnic groups were still connected. From this, it is inferred that the Chinese at that time could directly talk to the British, Egyptians, and Jews. The two words "papa" and "mama" were spoken on the bottom floors, and fortunately, they were not forgotten, and they are still the same all over the world.

### Expedition

— Sha Wen

A red flag flutters, a roar sounds.

Wheels rumble, cigarette smoke floats.

Hundreds of youthful faces smile in the window, waving hands fly outside the window.

Ten thousand throats chant tragically, merging into a torrent of uninhibitedness, washing away the barriers of mountains and trees, to call for the performance of an agitation!

The bullet jumps madly in the embrace!

I said: "Be good, and pass through the mountains and passes, you will have a day of freedom; then, I will celebrate your release from shackles."

### Introducing New Actors Coming to Shanghai Soon

— Wei Wo

After the renovation of the New Stage, the first batch of Peking Opera actors, Zhao Jinrong, Liang Yunqiu, and Wu Suqiu, three female performers, have decided on the performances. Except that Jinrong plans to stay in Shanghai for a while, and Yunqiu returned to Beijing a few days ago, Wu Suqiu, who is still performing, will finish her contract on the 27th. According to the person in charge of the New Stage, the cast that will replace Wu has been finalized, including Zheng Bingru, Guan Dayuan, Li Hongchun, Yin Jinzhen, Liu Yanting, Song Yuchun, Zhang Lianchang, etc., who will soon set off for Shanghai, and are expected to meet the people of Shanghai in the middle of next month. This group of people may not be familiar to the people of Shanghai, so I will introduce them as follows:

Zheng Bingru: A famous female dan in Tianjin and Qingdao. She has been the star attraction in the two major theaters, China and Mingxing in Tianjin, for a long time. Bingru has a fair face, a graceful figure, and a very beautiful appearance.

Guan Dayuan: In recent years, many people have regarded Yu Fugui and Ma Lianliang as the best in sheng, but in fact, there are many who can compete with Tan and Ma. Feng Er (Wang Fengqing) is old, Lao Qing (Gao Qing) has lost his voice, and Guan Dayuan's art is no less than that of Fugui and Lianliang, except that his face is not as agile as Tan and Ma's. Dayuan also has an excellent foundation in martial arts. He is proficient in both civil and military sheng dramas. His masterpieces include fighting plays such as "Dingjun Mountain" and "Pearl Curtain Village." He is also skilled in "Exiting the Box" from "Fighting with Sticks", "Hanging Hair" from "Four Sons Visit Mother", and "Drumming" from "Drumming and Scolding Cao". His voice is also loud, pleasant, and moving. He cooperated with Cheng Yanqiu for a long time in his early years, and also traveled to Japan with Mei Lanfang.

Yin Jinzhen: Specializing in martial arts, he graduated from the Opera School. He is the only open-mouthed jumping talent in the opera school. Among the rising stars, only Jinzhen can compare with Ye Shengzhang. Jinzhen has the temperament of a scholar, is kind and amiable in his dealings with others. At school, he received instruction from the two old opera masters Shen Sanyu and Ding Yongli, and he has studied carefully and diligently. His art is remarkable. He is proficient in all the stunts that a martial arts should have, such as "short steps," "somersaults," "big tops," and "bean scarves." Jinzhen is especially good at the "flying sky sound" technique.

Li Hongchun: A talented disciple of Lao San Mazi Wang Hongshou, he has obtained his true inheritance, and he is proficient in both civil and military Kunqu opera. He is known as the number one red sheng actor in the north, and he is also good at performing labor dramas. He is known as the "Northern Qilin Tong". He specializes in laosheng, and his repertoire is very broad. Wu Yanheng once became one of his followers.

Liu Yanting: Jiazi Hualian. He and Liu Yanfang are brothers, and he followed Yang Xiaolou for many years. He is best at pairing with martial arts dramas, and he also joined Cheng Yanqiu's Qiusheng Society for a time. His voice is slightly poor, but his skills are excellent.

Song Yuchun: Lizih Lao Sheng. He is a disciple of Li Hongchun. He once came to Shanghai with Tan Fuying, but because he imitated Li Hongchun too closely, he is only a mediocre talent.

Zhang Lianchang: Xiaosheng. He came from Fu Liancheng, and he is the senior brother of Du Fulong. His art is on par with Fulong's. This is his first time coming to Shanghai.

In addition to the above-mentioned people, it is heard that the New Theater has also retained Lao Dan Li Duokui, Wu Sheng Liang Huichao, Xiao Chou Jia Duocai, and Sun Shengwu. The lineup is evident.

### Flattering Eyes

— Xiao Tian

Flattering eyes refer to eyes that are exquisitely beautiful and captivating, distinguishing them from ordinary eyes. Some call them mesmerizing eyes, suggesting the eyes' power to bewitch and confound the senses, which is also understandable. Others argue they should be called eyebrow-eyes, but everyone has eyebrows and eyes; these are just ordinary eyebrows and eyes, which do not mark them as unique, and are therefore not worthy of the name. Some refer to the ancient saying of eyebrows and eyes conveying affection, taking only a simple allusion to this. It is said that the meaning arrives, but the brush does not reach it, which is a far-fetched argument. Moreover, modern fashionable women mostly draw their eyebrows. Once they are drawn, their beauty or ugliness depends entirely on the skill of the drawing, and cannot be compared with naturally beautiful eyes.

Among the dancers of the metropolis, there are two sets of flattering eyes. Yu Meili's are large and flattering; when she glances askance, she seems to be smiling without smiling, and seeing without seeing. Shen Weiying's are small and flattering; even when she looks straight ahead, she seems to be smiling, and she looks exceptionally good from afar. Her younger sister, Weimei, is only shoulder-high, but her eyes are very similar to her sister's. One wonders how many womanizers she will captivate in the future. She can be called little flattering eyes.

Lu Qinzhen, a dancer from the Far East Dance Hall, is known as the queen of eyebrows and eyes. The other day I happened to meet her at the metropolis. I was a guest of her close friend, and was able to invite her to dance. Upon closer inspection, her eyes are actually mesmerizing, not flattering, because both her straight and sidelong glances lack charming allure. However, when she slightly closes her eyes towards someone, accompanied by a faint smile, she truly possesses the power to captivate and seduce. It is said that although she is active in a mid-level dance hall, her monthly earnings from dancing exceed those of even the top stars in high-end dance halls.

Hu Yanyan from Dahua, a native of Wujin, has not been dancing for long and still speaks with a local accent, but her reputation is rapidly rising, almost rivaling Chen Manli. Some say she owes her success to her flattering eyes, but in fact, Yanyan does not have flattering eyes, but beautiful eyes. Her eyes are clear and bright, with distinct black and white, and are purely beautiful, not the kind that glance straight or sidelong. My friend, the portly Mr. Pang, cherishes her as if she were a bright pearl or beautiful jade. The other day he went to Dahua, and she sat at her station for a long time without budging. Mr. Pang, feeling utterly bored, called another hostess to sit with him. The first hostess initially looked displeased, but as she left, she suddenly glanced back and smiled. Mr. Pang's eyes stared straight ahead and his spirit seemed fixed. Another friend said, "How could she not send your soul flying halfway to heaven with that final glance?"

New Movie Introduction

### A Lark Leaving the Valley

— Qi Hua

"The Under-Pup"

The rise of a new star may be due to opportunity, but the most essential basic conditions cannot be ignored. After the release of "A Lark Leaving the Valley," eleven-year-old Gloria Jean's name will continue to be deeply imprinted in the minds of movie fans around the world, just like Deanna Durbin's. Naturally, she had the good fortune to be promoted by Universal Studios, but she possesses the basic skills of singing, riding, swimming, and more, which enabled her to complete this movie, "A Lark Leaving the Valley." Moreover, these basic skills determine that she will have even greater development in the future. According to publicity, Gloria Jean's singing is pure high soprano. To our "lay ears," her voice lacks the "sweetness" of Deanna Durbin's, but this may be due to her age, and her voice will certainly change as she gets older. Her acting also feels deeply influenced by Shirley Temple, but the early Shirley Temple still retained a child's innocence and liveliness, which is what makes Gloria Jean so adorable. It is hoped that she will forever maintain the original appearance of a child before she "grows up."

The story of "A Lark Leaving the Valley" was of course tailored for this young actress, but the theme of "summer camp for children" allows children to experience a lively collective life and develop a spirit of self-governance by organizing a "self-government association," which is very meaningful. Watching the groups of children on the screen, all so lively and cute, I can't help but feel that our "child stars" are too restrained. The only regret is that the story is too fragmented, diluting the climax of Jenny and Cecilia competing for the swimming championship.

Wallace Worsley's directorial skills compensate for the shortcomings in the story, and every page and scene is lively and interesting. In particular, Gloria Jean's grandfather and the music director of the children's camp are portrayed humorously, greatly enhancing the film. The acting skills of these two actors are also worth our attention. Gloria Jean was given ample opportunities to act. She was introduced in the opening scene with a "close-up" shot, and later, in scenes such as the farewell at the station, the conflict with Cecilia, helping Jenny win the swimming championship, and accepting her grandfather's advice to apologize to Cecilia, Gloria Jean, who had only received six months of training, was able to achieve such results, proving that her future is limitless.

Nan Grey and Robert Coote are merely Gloria Jean's subordinates, with very few scenes. The girl who played Jenny (Virginia Weidler) is also a promising child star.
