### Northern Hunan Japanese Troops Continue to Retreat Northward; Chinese Pursuit Troops Advance Directly to Tongcheng; Japanese Troops on the Upper Reaches of the Xinqiang River Collapse in Disarray Along Two Routes; One Route of Japanese Troops Flees Northward from Nanjiang Bridge to Huang'an and Taolin; Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangxi Confront the Japanese North of Jiuxianyang

Changsha: Remnants of the Japanese army in the area between Nanjiang Bridge and Jiuling northeast of Pingjiang have, for the most part, [illegible], with only a few remaining. Today they are collapsing northeastward toward Tongcheng. Chinese pursuit troops have already reached the vicinity of Tongcheng. (Eighth Dispatch)

Changsha: Chinese pursuit troops on the Ting-E Highway, after recovering Nanjiang Bridge, went on to capture Shangtashi yesterday afternoon. When the Japanese troops retreated from Nanjiang Bridge on the sixth, they originally split into two routes, one retreating northwest toward Huang'an and Taocun. Chinese pursuit troops have now crossed the upper reaches of the Xinqiang River and are continuing their advance northward. The other route retreated north toward Shangtashi and Jiuling. The local civilian self-defense forces took advantage of the Japanese troops' collapse and, joining forces with the Chinese pursuit troops, attacked from both the front and the rear, inflicting particularly heavy losses on this group of Japanese troops. It is estimated that the Chinese side killed approximately three hundred Japanese soldiers and wounded four hundred. The remaining Japanese troops, numbering just over two hundred, have all fled north to Tongcheng. There are now no traces of the Japanese army south of Jiuling Bridge. This morning, Chinese troops held a celebration rally in Jiuling, attended by over 20,000 local soldiers and civilians. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. (Eighth Dispatch)

Miluo: According to reports from Xinqiangzhen, Rongjiawan, and Yanglinjie, each area had over a thousand Japanese troops. After a day and night of encirclement and suppression by the Chinese army, more than half were killed or wounded. The rear of the Japanese troops was cut off from all communication by the Chinese units north of the Xinqiang River, leaving them in a state of exhaustion with no supplies and no hope of rescue. It will not be difficult to eliminate the remaining forces. (Eighth Dispatch)

Shashi: On the morning of the sixth, Chinese troops launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops at Majiatai. The Japanese army drew over three hundred infantry and cavalry troops from Yanglinkou, along with twelve mountain guns and mortars, to launch a roundabout encirclement of the Chinese attacking troops. A certain Chinese unit originally intended to intercept the Japanese. A fierce battle unfolded in the area of Pengjiatai. From noon to midnight, the Japanese army launched a total of eleven fierce assaults. The intensity of the battle and the number of Japanese casualties were unprecedented in the past two months. Because the Japanese army was attacked from two directions by the Chinese, they fled in panic. A large number of Japanese documents and military supplies were seized in this battle. (Seventh Dispatch)

Gao'an: Over eight hundred Japanese troops in northern Jiangxi (with four artillery pieces) launched a counterattack towards Jiuxianyang on the evening of the seventh. The fighting was fierce. By the morning of the eighth, the Japanese had been repelled. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforced their forces, adding over ten more artillery pieces and dispatching over [illegible] aircraft to assist in another attack. Chinese troops calmly responded to the battle, and the position remained unyielding. By noon, the Japanese had continued to increase their forces to over three thousand, firing over a thousand shells. The Chinese side also gradually increased its reinforcements, fighting more and more bravely. Finally, at 4:00 PM, the Japanese were repelled. Currently, Chinese troops are still in the area north of Jiuxianyang, confronting the Japanese. (Eighth Dispatch)

Gao'an: After the Chinese army recovered Jiuxianyang, they launched an attack toward the north bank of the Shangfu River, killing over five hundred Japanese soldiers. On the morning of the eighth, the Japanese troops collapsed toward Yecheng in the direction of Xinan. (Eighth Dispatch)

### Reasons for the Japanese Defeat in the Northern Hunan Campaign

Guilin: The success or failure of the Northern Hunan campaign has now been determined. According to military observers, the errors in the Japanese military deployment and the decline in combat power are the reasons for the defeat. The success of the Chinese army's use of the strategy of defeating the enemy one by one is the main factor in quickly defeating the Japanese army and achieving victory. One observer stated that in this campaign, the Japanese used seven divisions, and the front line stretched for five hundred li from the east bank of Dongting [illegible] to the river basin, passing through the large mountain ranges of Mufu and Jiuling. The Japanese troop deployment was approximately three divisions (including special forces) on the front facing [illegible], one division in the Pingjiang area, and three divisions in the northern Jiangxi area. The strategy used was still the "encirclement and annihilation" of one army. Starting from the 14th of last month, they initially feigned an attack on the Gao'an line. By the 18th, they began to launch an offensive on the [illegible] front with light and fast units. At the same time, the Japanese troops in Tongcheng also used light cavalry to maneuver southeast. The Japanese navy in Dongting Lake even put all their efforts into advancing south. The momentum was no different from the battles of Lunan and Wuhan. However, almost none of the various plans adopted by the Japanese were outside the calculations of the Chinese side. For the Japanese troops advancing lightly along the Pingjiang and [illegible] routes, the Chinese army waited until they reached a suitable area disadvantageous to the Japanese troops but most advantageous to the Chinese in the strategically important mountainous areas. From the front, left, and right, they surrounded and attacked each stronghold, truly achieving the goal of "defeating the enemy one by one." The Chinese army on the front line provided considerable resistance to the Japanese in the Xinqiang and Mishui river basins, making mobile shifts, waiting for the Japanese to break through to the area south of the Mishui River, and then launching a fierce counterattack, forcing them to collapse. In this campaign, the Japanese deployed seven divisions along a front line stretching five hundred li, which prevented them from achieving effective coordination and communication. Moreover, most of this front line consisted of steep and overlapping mountain ranges, making all supply efforts very difficult. Therefore, within ten days, the entire line was shaken due to poor coordination and difficult supply. Following that, the Chinese army's "defeating the enemy one by one" strategy pressured the troops, causing a total collapse in no time. The facts of this campaign prove that the Japanese combat power is much weaker than during the Battle of Wuhan. Some three divisions were newly formed, and their combat power was particularly weak. Once the Chinese army counterattacked, they collapsed at the first sight of trouble. All of these are reasons for the Japanese army's defeat in this campaign. One observer believes that after suffering this lesson, the Japanese will remain silent for a while, and it is even possible that they will never have the ability to invade again. On the other hand, the Chinese side is taking advantage of the victory to advance forward, and the future is limitless. (Eighth Dispatch)

A certain place in Northern Hunan: The world-renowned Northern Hunan campaign has rapidly entered its final stage due to the total collapse of the Japanese troops on all routes. In the midst of excitement, the reporter rushed to the front line to pay respects to a certain general and inquire about the process of defeating the Japanese army and his feelings. He graciously shared his thoughts, saying that this time, the Japanese used a large force of hundreds of thousands, divided into six routes from western Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan to converge on Changsha. The momentum was extremely fierce. However, the Japanese army's various attempts were already well understood by me. I made the greatest determination, firmly grasped the troops, launched a large-scale mobile war, implemented counter-encirclement tactics, defeated them one by one, and achieved a great victory in the interior operation. This victory was due to the flexible and skillful use of our strategies and tactics, as well as the agility of the movements of the various units and the dedication of the officers and soldiers. These were the main reasons for the victory. (Eighth Dispatch)

East of Yangzi: Chinese Army Achieves Victory

Fancheng: After a certain Chinese unit advanced and occupied Wuguishan and Changling east of Yangzi on the morning of the first, they immediately split up to attack Liujiadian, Fenshuiling, and Wujiadian. [illegible] They engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese overnight and finally defeated them, occupying the strongholds of Changling, Baishapo, and Liujiadian, and killing over fifty Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army is still continuing to pursue the Japanese. (Eighth Dispatch)

Japanese Troops from Heilongguan Invade Beilezhen

Another group, after [illegible] heading southwest through Qikongyao, the northern and southern sections of Duanjiagou, turned north. By 6:00 PM, they had joined forces with the Japanese troops invading from the west of Beilezhen to attack Puxian. Fierce fighting is currently underway. [illegible] Japanese troops from Fencheng and Xinjiang are advancing northwest, besieging Xiang [illegible]. At 8:00 AM this morning, they engaged in a fierce battle with Chinese troops in the area in front of the Guanwang Temple and on the Shangtaodian'ao. A part of the Japanese army from Xiangling, heading west through Niwangmiao, invaded Jixian. They are currently being blocked by Chinese troops in the area east of Zhentou. (Eighth Dispatch)

Japanese Aircraft Attack Guilin

Guilin: Eight Japanese aircraft, at 10:45 AM on the morning of the eighth, entered the airspace over Guilin City via Guiping, Liuzhou, and Yongfu, dropping over seventy bombs in the southwestern suburbs. They then flew north, entering the Hunan territory of Wuling via Xing'an and Huangsha River. After circling, they returned to Guilin City at 12:15 PM and circled for a moment before leaving along the original route. Two more batches of Japanese aircraft, one with seven aircraft, bombed Longzhou at 9:00 AM, and the other with eighteen aircraft, nine of which reconnoitered Long'an and nine of which bombed Wuming. Losses are unknown. (Eighth Dispatch)

### Chinese Army Counteroffensive Not Far Off; Japanese War Strength Gradually Weakening; Clear Evidence of Failure in Northern Hunan

Chongqing: The China Army mouthpiece, the "Saodang Bao" newspaper, today published an article by General Xu Peigen, stating that the period for a Chinese army counteroffensive is gradually approaching. In the first stage of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese attacked various areas on the periphery of China, with the battles taking place in the provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian. Since the Japanese army occupied Xuzhou, the Sino-Japanese War has entered the second stage, which can be called the "Central Region Campaign." The purpose of this stage is to concentrate forces to wage a war of attrition against the Japanese army. This stage of the war includes the battles in Guangdong Province, southern Shanxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Henan. The first half of this stage ended with the fall of Wuhan. At that time, although the Japanese army's resources were nearing depletion, they still had sufficient strength to launch offensives. The second half began this spring, when the Japanese army was supposed to make full preparations in the winter and attack Xi'an in the northwest and Nanning in the southwest. However, although the Japanese army occupied Nanchang, they could only remain entrenched there. Subsequently, the Japanese army repeatedly attacked the Taihang Mountains and Jincheng, and repeatedly attempted to occupy Sui [illegible], as well as the recent defeat in northern Hunan. Now, to say that the Sino-Japanese War has progressed from the second to the third stage, that is, the period of decisive battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies, seems premature. Xu also stated that the Northern Hunan campaign may not indicate that the Japanese army in China has been completely exhausted, but the time when the Chinese army will transition from a defensive to an offensive posture is not far off. According to reports, Xu was a spokesperson for the Chinese army and is currently an advisor to He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration. (Eighth Reuters Dispatch)

Sha Wu Issues Letter to Mongolian Compatriots

Yulin: The central government recently allocated several hundred thousand yuan to provide relief to the Mongolian people in Suiyuan Province, and personnel have been dispatched to distribute the funds. Wang Changsha, the chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Mongolian Affairs Committee, specifically issued a letter to Mongolian compatriots in Suiyuan Province. The original text reads: "Since the Lugouqiao Incident, all the banners of the Ordos League and the four banners in eastern Suiyuan have been occupied by the Japanese, and the people have suffered greatly, which goes without saying. Although the banners of the Ordos League near Wuyuan, Linhe, and Yikezhao League have not been occupied by the Japanese, the aftermath of war and disaster has left the people starving everywhere, which is a visible reality. In addition, the number of those fleeing from the banners of the Ordos League and the four banners in eastern Suiyuan is increasing day by day. This committee chairman is deeply concerned about this. The Mongolian people have never been engaged in production. Because each banner has suffered war, disasters, and displacement, I have repeatedly petitioned the central government during my stay in Chongqing. The central government, mindful of the plight of the Mongols and sympathizing with the difficulties of the people, has specifically approved an allocation of 100,000 yuan to provide urgent relief. After my return, the Mongolian Affairs Committee was renamed the Relief Committee, dedicated to this purpose. Recently, personnel dispatched by the central government have arrived in the banners with the funds, and this committee chairman has dispatched personnel to accompany them to distribute the funds in various areas. All of our disaster-stricken people will be able to receive benefits. At the same time, shelters have been established in the areas near the Ordos League, Wuyuan, and Linhe to gather the Mongolian compatriots who have suffered so that they can have a place to live. Following the urgent relief, a resettlement office for disaster-stricken people and Mongolian compatriots fleeing from the suppression will be established to alleviate the suffering of displacement and to move toward production."

### Chairman Chiang Rewards Frontline Soldiers; Issues 150,000 Yuan in Bonuses

Changsha: In this all-out invasion by the Japanese army from northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan, with 180,000 troops from the army, navy, and air force, attempting to converge on Changsha along six routes, thanks to the loyalty and courage of the Chinese soldiers, each Japanese army was crushed. Chairman Chiang commended them greatly for achieving an unprecedented victory before the Double Tenth Festival and specifically issued 150,000 yuan in bonuses to reward and encourage them. The original telegram reads as follows: "To the front lines: This time, the enemy invaded from northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan.

[illegible]" This time, Jiang Dingwen, Liu Zhi, Huang Shaoxiong, Yu Hanmou, Li Hanhun, and other important figures also sent telegrams of慰勞. (Eighth Dispatch)

### Japan Transfers Five More Divisions to Strengthen Invasion Force in China; One Division of Kwantung Army Arrives in Tianjin; Troop Strength in China Reaches 36 Divisions

Chongqing: According to reliable sources here, the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in China, Nishio, has now obtained the consent of Tokyo and the Kwantung Army to transfer three divisions from the Kwantung Army and two divisions of the Japanese army currently stationed in Taiwan to China to strengthen the strength of the Japanese army in North and Central China. One division of the Kwantung Army has already arrived in Tianjin. According to reliable sources in Tianjin, another division of the Japanese army will soon take a train south, probably heading to northern Hunan to strengthen the defenses of Yuezhou to confront the Chinese army in the Dongting Lake area. As for the two divisions transferred from Taiwan, they will also be used in the Central China area. After the addition of these five divisions, the total troop strength of the Japanese army in China will reach as many as thirty-six divisions. (Eighth Associated Press Dispatch)

Japanese Execute Anti-War Soldiers

Zhangshu: The Japanese army in Nanchang, due to military setbacks in northern Hunan and northern Jiangxi, is pessimistic about the future and filled with anti-war sentiment. After receiving reports, the Japanese army stationed in Nanchang conducted a large-scale search of the troops. At 9:00 AM on the fifth, they executed over ten anti-war soldiers at the Nanchang Airport and left their bodies in the suburbs. (Eighth Dispatch)

Northern Route慰勞团 Performs Banner Presentation Ceremony

Lanzhou: This morning at 8:00 AM, all sectors of Lanzhou held a welcome meeting for the Northern Route慰勞团 at the auditorium of the Provincial Party Headquarters. At the same time, the group held a banner presentation ceremony to the commander of the [illegible] War Zone. Over eight hundred people, including political and military leaders and representatives from various organizations, attended. Zeng Kuoqing, director of the Political Department of the [illegible] War Zone, delivered a welcoming speech, and Chief賀 delivered a慰勞 speech. Finally, the head of the [illegible]團[illegible] delivered a reply speech, and the meeting adjourned. (Morning of the Seventh)

Lanzhou: The Northern Route慰勞团 arrived in Lanzhou and paid a special visit to Zhu Shaoliang, the commander of the [illegible] War Zone, this morning to pay their respects and inquire about the military, political, economic, transportation, and strategic situation of the Northwest Anti-Japanese War. Zhu, with a strong physique, wearing the uniform of a general, and looking radiant, spoke in an extremely humble and amiable manner, saying that the military situation in the Northwest currently involves only small-scale conflicts west of Baotou and in the Yikezhao League, with no large-scale contact. Judging from the Japanese situation, it is currently extremely difficult for them to invade the Northwest. I attach even greater importance to politics than to military affairs in the Northwest. The current understanding between the Mongolian and Hui compatriots is very deep. Mongolian troops are all on the front lines, fighting alongside Han troops against the Japanese, which is unprecedented in history. In terms of economic hope, the minimum goal for the near future is to achieve self-sufficiency. Fiscal finances have gradually completed a balance of income and expenditure. After rectification, the Gansu Provincial Bank has a turnover capacity of 15 million yuan, which can reach 10 million yuan next year. With this ability, the financial foundation for all construction is almost without question. The transportation of special machinery is more difficult. As for transportation, the highest principle in Gansu Province is to increase transportation capacity. There are currently [illegible] trunk lines between Shaanxi and Gansu and a number of branch lines. In the event of an emergency, others can still be used [illegible] Furthermore, the highway directly connecting to Sichuan has exceeded [illegible] and reached the Sichuan border within Gansu. Once this road is opened, international transportation will be even more convenient. Zhu did not express any views on Sino-Soviet diplomacy, saying that the Soviet Union's continued aid to China is its established policy and will not be affected by the European war.

Editorial

### Chairman Chiang Personally Manages Sichuan Affairs

Geographically, Sichuan is located in the center of China, and Chengdu is 30 degrees of latitude away from the eastern and western extremes of the country, truly in the center of the nation. In terms of the War of Resistance, Sichuan is the center of political and military affairs. Historically, Sichuan has always been considered difficult to govern. The saying "When the world is not in chaos, Shu is in chaos first; when the world is governed, Shu is not governed" has been lamented by political theorists throughout history. The poet Du Gongbu also has the line "The situation in Western Shu is the most dangerous in the world; peace and security must rely on the talents of exceptional ability," which can give a general idea. Because it is the center of the country and the center of the War of Resistance, it is difficult to govern. It is appropriate that news from Sichuan is the subject of extreme attention both inside and outside. Yesterday's newspaper reported that Chengdu 电said:

"Wang Jixu, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, earnestly requests to go out of Sichuan to participate in the War of Resistance, and has been ordered to do so. All provincial duties will be concurrently managed by Chairman Chiang. At nine o'clock on the seventh, Chairman Chiang personally went to the Provincial Government to oversee affairs and gave instructions to various战员. He left the government after ten o'clock. The weather was clear that day, and the future of Sichuan Province was infinitely bright; the people were all happy and excited, hanging flags to celebrate." This is bound to be of comfort to those who hear it, and the excitement of the people of Sichuan, hanging flags to celebrate, can be imagined.

"Bird's-eye view" of Sichuan Province: surrounded by mountains on all sides, with turbulent currents flowing inward. The land relies on the steepness of the Jiange plank road, and the water has the dangers of Qutang Gorge and Yan预滩. Its momentum is sufficient to defend itself. Between the Min River, Tuo River, and Jialing River, there are vast plains, crisscrossed by ditches and canals, with mild climate and abundant products. Its wealth is sufficient to sustain itself. Therefore, it has often been the base for powerful individuals to divide and occupy the territory, close the borders, and claim hegemony to resist the court. However, when it came to grief, there was internal division and mutual slaughter, or they indulged in pleasure, and complacent, corrupt existence. This kind of abnormal situation has also been seen repeatedly. When Sima Cuo of Qin conquered Ba and Shu, when Guangwu of Han pacified Gongsun Shu, when Sima Zhao of Wei destroyed Shu Han, and when Zhu Hongwu of Ming destroyed Ming Sheng, all these historical facts, from the local perspective, were self-inflicted. From the perspective of nation-building, unifying the territory, and stabilizing the overall situation, the governance of Sichuan has produced capable people, but the problem lies in the lack of leadership. Therefore, the achievements are still in various partial parts and fragments. In the summer of the 26th year, Chairman Chiang had a plan to create a unified military organization in Sichuan and Kang, in order to unify the national military organization. The various military and political authorities in Sichuan were all able to wholeheartedly and sincerely obey the order, and Gao Fa began, and the "July 7th" Lugouqiao Incident broke out. The people of Sichuan have long lived and prospered in an atmosphere of war, and bravery and goodness are their habits. After August 13th, the Sichuan army set off upon summons, and no less than 600,000 people generously went to the national crisis, giving full play to their experience of long-term military service, engaged in the national war, with hardship and outstanding achievements, praised by the people of the country, and gained the good reputation of "no army can be formed without Sichuan". When the National Government was stationed in Chongqing, all important military, political, economic, educational, and cultural institutions were concentrated in Sichuan Province, which became the great base camp for the revival of the Chinese nation. However, the most urgent task at present is to fight, and the front line stretches for thousands of miles. Therefore, matters directly related to the battle, such as military decision-making, troop deployment, central government affairs arrangements, and the maintenance and construction of external communications, are innumerable, without 連甯处, and none of them are not related to the national overall situation. Therefore, the National Government has been in Sichuan for a year and has not had time to actively manage Sichuan Province. As of today, the situation of the War of Resistance has reached a stable stage; the most urgent task in the future is to enrich the foundation, enlighten the national strength, and gradually enter a new period of counter-offensive and victory. Chairman Chiang used his spare time from overseeing the overall situation and personally managed Sichuan affairs. This is the beginning of a new era, and is a sign of [illegible] progress.

### Delegation from Lithuania Arrives in Moscow for Military Negotiations; Soviet Union Demands Fortifications Along the Neman River and Military Bases Within Lithuanian Territory

Moscow - The Lithuanian government delegation arrived in Moscow on the 7th. The representatives include Foreign Minister Urbšys, Assistant Minister Bicas, and General Raštikis, the Chief of the General Staff. Also accompanying them are Minister of Economy Norkaitis and several experts. When the delegation arrived at the Central Airport in Moscow, key Soviet figures were present to welcome them. These included Deputy Chairman Lozovsky of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Chairman Stepanov of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade, Deputy Chief of Staff Smorodinov of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, Deputy Chairman Yesnov of the Moscow Soviet, Chargé d'affaires Posdyezhkov of the Soviet Union in Lithuania, Trade Representative Ivanov of the Soviet Union in Lithuania, Director Bakov of the Treaty Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Director Vansyugov of the Baltic Department of the Foreign Affairs Commissariat, Commander Lev Yeging of Moscow, Director Osyolotov of the Foreign Affairs Department of the People's Commissariat for Defense, Acting Director Mischustin of the Treaty Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade, and all personnel of the Lithuanian embassy in the Soviet Union. The national flags of the Soviet Union and Lithuania were hung around the Central Airport. (TASS telegram, 7th)

Moscow - Talks between Lithuania and the Soviet Union began at 10 PM last night in the Kremlin. People here generally feel that Lithuania will inevitably accept the conditions proposed by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union will kick Lithuania, making it a protectorate of the Soviet Union, similar to the situation of Estonia and Latvia, ceding naval bases to the Soviet Union, and allowing it to establish and manage railways along the coast from Finngen to Vilnius and Liepaja. (Associated Press telegram, 8th)

Moscow - Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys returned here by plane at 5:30 PM. He is scheduled to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at 10 PM tonight. Foreign observers here are commenting on the negotiations between Lithuania and the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet government wants to take advantage of Germany's lack of attention to present various demands to Lithuania. The minimum requirement is that when a major power invades the Soviet Union, or when the Soviet Union defends various countries from the threat of a great power, it will be allowed Soviet troops to pass through Lithuanian territory. At this time, the Soviet Union must be allowed the right to station troops in Lithuania's borders with Germany and build fortifications along the border. It is believed that after Germany acquired the Memel region from Lithuania in March of this year, it maintained a good position along the Baltic coast. The Soviet Union is quite uneasy and wants to counteract it. (Havas News Agency telegram, 7th)

Moscow - Foreign sources today reported that after Soviet troops occupied the northern Polish city of Vilnius, they were preparing to cede a certain area near the city to Lithuania. (Note: Vilnius originally belonged to Lithuania). Officials here did not deny this claim, but most people believe that the area is barren and that Lithuania would only increase its burden if it were to take it back. Therefore, it is possible that Lithuania will politely decline. (Havas News Agency telegram, 7th)

The Hague, Netherlands - The Telegraaf newspaper here recently carried a dispatch from its correspondent in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, stating that the Soviet Union has demanded that Lithuania allow it to build fortifications along the Neman River at the border between Lithuania and Germany, forming an Eastern European Maginot Line, and to establish naval bases and build fortifications on the Lithuanian coast, 20 kilometers from the German port of Memel. In addition, the Red Army should build air force bases in certain areas of western and southern Lithuania. As for Latvia, military negotiations between the Soviet Union and Latvia are scheduled to begin within the next week. As a result, the Soviet Union will likely occupy an area of at least 70 kilometers wide on the western coast of Latvia. In short, the number of Soviet troops stationed in the Baltic countries will far exceed the number of troops in each of those countries' armies. Soviet authorities openly admit that this measure is intended to resist the aggression of a major power. Although the newspapers did not specify which country, Germany is the only one that can compete with the Soviet Union in the Baltic Sea. (Havas telegram, 7th)

### Germany Seeks Economic Cooperation with the Soviet Union; Cargo Transport Problems Must Be Solved First

Moscow - Foreign observers here are commenting on the economic benefits that Germany can obtain from the Soviet Union. They say that Germany originally regarded the Soviet Union as a hypothetical enemy. However, due to the invasion of Poland, it first abandoned this idea and allowed the Soviet Union to control the countries of Central and Eastern Europe politically and economically, as well as to control the wheat and oil produced by Romania. It also allowed the Soviet Union to develop its power around the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. Today, if the Soviet Union is unwilling to supply agricultural products to Germany, the Baltic countries may also be forced to stop selling agricultural products to Germany, and Germany can do nothing about it. At the same time, Germany has also given up its oil mines within Poland to the Soviet Union. Germany has in fact concluded an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has agreed to promote bilateral trade relations. However, apart from exchanging letters between Molotov and Ribbentrop, no economic cooperation agreement has been signed. The economic delegation sent by the German government, including oil experts and railway experts, arrived here yesterday. Their task is to find appropriate locations for bilateral economic cooperation. The important issue that needs to be resolved first is that the different railway gauges of Germany and the Soviet Union hinder cargo transport. Moreover, even if the Soviet Union is truly willing to cooperate with Germany, at most it will only divert the goods originally shipped to Britain and France to Germany. Soviet goods, especially Soviet oil, have recently been interrupted to Britain and France. Under the actual situation, well-informed sources believe that only one to two million tons of Soviet oil can be exported, and at most only 150,000 to 200,000 tons of grain can be exported. Although the Soviet Union can stop its export trade with other countries, thereby increasing exports to Germany, it is still a drop in the bucket in terms of Germany's needs. In addition, the Soviet Union still has a way, which is to buy gasoline from the United States and resell it to Germany. At the same time, Germany can send experts to the Soviet Union to help the Soviet government develop production, thereby increasing the production of oil, manganese, aluminum, magnesium, and iron ore. What is unknown is that even if the Soviet Union accepts this method, how many experts can Germany send. (Havas telegram, 7th)

Soviet-Turkish Agreement

Rumors of Signing Last Night

London - Rome Radio announced today that it heard from official circles in Ankara that the Soviet-Turkish agreement could be signed tonight. (Reuters telegram, 8th)

Moscow - According to German sources, Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu met with Foreign Minister Molotov again today, but Turkish sources here denied it. Foreign observers here say that if the reports are true, and the Soviet government has just issued a communiqué without mentioning it at all, this situation is particularly noteworthy. It is thought that since the Soviet Union and Turkey maintain friendly relations, and Turkey and Britain are also friendly, how to reconcile the two is extremely difficult. Therefore, the Soviet Union and Turkey have not yet reached any agreement. According to unconfirmed news, the Soviet government has concentrated troops in Baku, Azerbaijan. If this is true, it can be interpreted in two ways: one is a precautionary measure against Turkey, and the other is a precautionary measure against British territories in the Near East.

### Political Turmoil Brewing in Estonia; Soviet Troop Stationing Stopped

Tallinn, Estonia - According to the Estonian-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, Soviet troops will begin to be transported to Estonia for stationing within the next week. It is reported that there are considerable difficulties regarding the transportation and supply of Soviet troops. The Soviet Union is planning temporary measures to find accommodation for the 25,000 troops stipulated in the Estonian-Soviet treaty, pending the preparation of suitable barracks. The political crisis in Estonia began to show signs at the start of the Soviet-Estonian negotiations and is now even more serious. It is generally believed that Prime Minister Eenpalu will resign next week to allow President Päts to reorganize the cabinet. Speaker of the Parliament Uluots will serve as prime minister. He has already discussed cabinet formation with various important figures. Foreign Minister Selter will also be transferred to the post of ambassador to the Soviet Union. (Haitong News Agency telegram, 8th)

Stockholm, Sweden - According to a telegram from Tallinn received by a certain newspaper, Estonia is now rejecting further demands from the Soviet Union and insisting on complying with the Estonian-Soviet agreement. It is believed that the Soviet Union has not only reiterated its plan to establish several Soviet military outposts in central and southern Estonia, but also demanded the entire territory of the two large seaports of Vormsi and Hiiumaa. (Reuters telegram, 8th)

Moscow - According to reliable sources, the demands recently made by the Soviet government to Estonia, in addition to allowing the use of naval bases, include allowing the Soviet Union to station four divisions of troops in Estonia, including: one motorized division stationed in Narva (on the border between Estonia and the Soviet Union), one infantry division stationed in Haapsalu, one cavalry division stationed in Valga, and one infantry division stationed in Valmiera (near the border with Latvia). This request has been abandoned after being opposed by Estonia. (Havas News Agency telegram, day not provided)

### Finland Decides to Send Special Envoy to Soviet Union for Negotiations; Reserves Called Up

Copenhagen - Finnish Prime Minister Cajander, in an interview with a reporter from the Danish newspaper "National Daily" today, announced that after a cabinet meeting held in Finland yesterday, it was decided to send a special envoy to Moscow to conduct negotiations on matters of mutual interest.

This matter was decided upon accepting a proposal from the Russian side. The person chosen is not Foreign Minister Erkko himself. Cajander strongly denied rumors that Foreign Minister Erkko was tired of his duties, saying that they were not in line with the facts. (Haitong telegram, 8th)

Helsinki, Finland - The Finnish Ministry of Defense has recently issued an order to call up reserves and issued the following statement: "In order to ensure the neutrality of the country, the Ministry has called up reserves. Due to insufficient facilities in barracks in various places, the garrisons in various places have been temporarily transferred to the countryside, while engaging in the construction of defense works." (Haitong telegram, 8th)

Stockholm, Sweden - It is learned that the Soviet government has strongly urged the Finnish government to send Foreign Minister Erkko to Moscow for negotiations. Observers believe that the Soviet government intends to discuss various political issues with the Finnish Foreign Minister. Regarding this, according to as-yet unconfirmed news, the Soviet Union is reportedly demanding that Finland provide a solid guarantee not to fortify the Åland Islands, and at the same time demanding that it cede some territory, as Estonia and Latvia have done. In short, the Soviet Union believes that the island of Hogland, which belongs to Finland, is strategically important, and that it must send troops to station on the island in order to protect the port of Kronstadt in its country. In addition, the Finnish government has reportedly called up reserves for military service in order to protect its neutrality. (Havas telegram, 7th)

### President Roosevelt Has No Intention of Mediating the European Situation; No Room for Consideration of a Truce Before Obtaining Agreement from Britain and France

Washington - According to opinions from government officials here, President Roosevelt cannot mediate the European war at this time. There are two fundamental reasons: one is the difficulty of devising a fully guaranteed method to prevent Hitler from going back on his word again, and the other is the impossibility of any solution that would allow the Czechs and Poles to be permanently trapped in a state of slavery. (Reuters telegram, 8th)

Washington - US Secretary of State Hull said today while receiving reporters that the US government has not received any unofficial message from Germany asking President Roosevelt to come out and mediate the European war. Chairman Pittman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stated that President Roosevelt must first obtain clear evidence from the belligerent countries that they have already taken steps to prepare for reconciliation, and then he can mediate peace. If President Roosevelt's view is accepted under the current environment, then President Roosevelt will be able to put forward appropriate suggestions without hesitation. However, this should not be interpreted as President Roosevelt interfering in other people's affairs or agreeing to act as an arbiter. (Reuters telegram, 8th)

Washington - President Roosevelt said yesterday that he was not prepared to be a mediator in the current European war. Presidential Secretary Hassett told reporters, "The President has asked me to tell you that there is nothing to say about the mediation issue." When the reporter told him that the opposite of that question could be interpreted as a refusal to mediate, Hassett said, "You can interpret it as you wish." Prime Minister Butler's insistence that negotiators must recognize the "fait accompli" of Poland makes it difficult for President Roosevelt to take any peace movement. The United States has already declared that the United States does not recognize the conquest of Poland. Friends of President Roosevelt said that if the President feels that the future of the European issue is promising, he intends to use his prestige to mediate. (Associated Press telegram, 8th)

Washington - According to news from Berlin, if US President Roosevelt comes forward to mediate the European war, then German leader Hitler may accept it. The White House recently issued a statement authorized by the President, saying that the President does not want to express any opinion. People around the President then explained, slightly saying that this suggestion from Germany is now only seen in newspaper reports. If the German government does not submit it through diplomatic channels, President Roosevelt will ignore it. Secretary of State Hull gave a speech to the press not long ago, only saying that he had read about this matter in the newspapers, and refused to express an opinion. However, Republican Senator Johnson, who had previously proposed to the Senate that President Roosevelt come forward to mediate, now hears of this sharp increase in interest, and says that the President should accept it. People in political circles view this with skepticism, regarding it as a move by the German propaganda machine to test the President's opinion. As for isolationists, who have always opposed interfering in European affairs, they are not happy even if peace is maintained, and they do not want President Roosevelt to be instigated by German leader Hitler to act as a mediator, so as not to fall into Germany's trap and be mocked by the world. People around the State Department said that there is no room for consideration of mediation until the agreement of Britain and France is obtained. President Roosevelt himself did not want to intervene because he was bound to fail in the negotiations, nor did he want to merely seek convenience for Germany, merely promoting a truce without restoring real peace. Most of the senators in the Senate oppose the proposal of mediation, and said that it must wait for Britain and France to express their approval, and that only when the foundation of a lasting peace has hope of being established can it be considered. The debate on amending the Neutrality Act will not be significantly affected by this. (Havas telegram, 7th)

### New US Neutrality Act Expected to Pass

Washington - Chairman Pittman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee predicted yesterday that the Senate would pass the new Neutrality Act proposed by the government on Saturday or Sunday of next week. The prediction was announced after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a closed-door meeting. At the meeting, Chairman of the Maritime Commission, Rear Admiral Land, stated that the enactment of the Neutrality Act would cause American ships to "suffer considerable losses." Pittman said that although Rear Admiral Land made that statement, he felt that the development of shipping in South America and the Pacific was greater than the losses in the Atlantic. He was convinced that the form of the Neutrality Act would not change. (Associated Press telegram, 8th)

Washington - Chairman Pittman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who is also the proposer of the Neutrality Act amendment, recently held a meeting with several Democratic senators to discuss strategies to be adopted during the Senate debate. Pittman then gave a speech to the Havas News Agency reporter, saying, "I believe that the number of senators who support this bill will definitely increase day by day. It is already known to the American people that this bill should be passed urgently, and there is no reason to delay it any longer. I hope that it can be put to a vote before the end of next week."

### Britain and France Exchange Views on the Issue of War and Peace; Intend to Issue Statement Explaining War Aims

London - It was learned here today that Britain and France are exchanging views on the peace speech given by German Chancellor Hitler to the German Parliament on Friday, and intend to issue a detailed statement explaining the aims of the Allied forces in the war. The new Polish ambassador to Britain will come here next week to meet with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and other British government officials. It is believed here that Germany is worried about a long-term war, so it will continue to receive peace suggestions. The peace suggestions proposed by Chancellor Hitler on Friday may widen the gap between Germany and Italy. Chancellor Hitler disregarded the advice of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and directly proposed peace conditions. It is believed that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has abandoned the peace program proposed by Prime Minister Mussolini for reconciliation. That program was proposed to Germany by Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano. (Associated Press telegram, 8th)

Berlin - Officials of the National Socialist Party here are all waiting quietly for the reaction of Britain and France to Hitler's speech in parliament. They believe that there will be no concrete reaction from Britain and France within two weeks. Authoritative sources stated, "Hitler's speech was an extremely clever expression, so Britain and France must also give a clear answer. Hitler's speech was also aimed at neutral countries. US President Roosevelt may be a pioneer for human peace." (Associated Press telegram, 8th)

Paris - Political figures here recently declared that regarding the speech given by German leader Hitler the other day, the governments of Britain and France are currently exchanging views, so that British Prime Minister Chamberlain can give a speech in the British House of Commons within the next week, putting forward an answer in the name of the British and French governments. Germany is now increasingly isolated. Although Germany and the Soviet Union jointly issued a declaration a week ago, intending to do their best for peace, Hitler only spoke about Germany's intentions when he gave a speech the other day, and failed to represent the Soviet Union's opinions, which shows that the Soviet Union is increasingly unwilling to openly assist Germany. As for Japan, it is rumored that the country has already withdrawn from the Anti-Comintern Pact. Although this has been denied, the fact that the country has no intention of enriching this pact is worthy of attention. As for the Berlin-Rome axis, Hitler did not mention it at all. Italy's determination to maintain neutrality, at least to temporarily maintain neutrality, can be proven again. (Havas telegram, 8th)

London - British newspapers commented on the speech given by German leader Hitler the other day, slightly saying, "The most peace-loving people in the world have no choice but to firmly reject the suggestions put forward by Germany. National public opinion can be expressed in these few words." The Sunday Dispatch wrote, "Hitler has indeed put forward a peace plan as expected, but Britain and France have not seen any hope of stopping hostilities early. Britain must prepare for a long-term war, which is already beyond dispute." The Sunday Express wrote, "Peace has become a thing of the past, and the war is about to drag on. These two phrases are enough to express the situation after Hitler's speech." The Observer Weekly wrote, "British and French officials believe that Hitler's speech does not need to be formally answered. The most appropriate course of action is for Prime Minister Chamberlain and Prime Minister Daladier to incidentally mention it when reporting on the war situation." (Havas, 8th)

Amsterdam - The British government will use the end of this week to carefully investigate Hitler's peace suggestions, and will also consult and exchange views with the French government and the autonomous governments. Then, Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to submit the British government's attitude to the cabinet for discussion in the beginning of next week. (Haitong telegram, 8th)

Berlin - A representative of the German Foreign Ministry replied to inquiries from foreign journalists last night, saying that the questions raised by Chancellor Hitler in his speech in parliament are all important matters, and the answers from all parties are extremely relevant to future developments, so it is difficult to obtain detailed answers in the short term. People in Berlin also believe that Hitler's suggestions are extremely complex and cannot be clearly answered in a short period of time. (Haitong telegram, 8th)

### Italian Authorities Maintain Silence

Rome Regarding the suggestion by German leader Hitler in his parliamentary speech to convene an international conference, relevant authorities here are mostly silent on the question of whether the Italian government will issue invitations to various countries to participate. Official sources here stated that Italy will provide unreserved diplomatic assistance to Germany's efforts to resolve issues such as raw materials, currency, armaments, and international security, with the primary aim of restoring peace in Western Europe. The semi-official "Italian News Agency" published a lengthy article yesterday, stating, "Mussolini and Hitler both take as their responsibility the liberation of Europe from the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles, rebuilding a new European order based on satisfying the vital interests of all nations, promoting interconnectedness among nations, ensuring that all countries fairly enjoy the world's raw materials and colonies, and organizing free trade. Only after these issues are reasonably resolved can lasting peace be achieved." (Eighth, Shanghai News Agency Dispatch)

Rome Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech today at the Palazzo Venezia to five hundred Fascist leaders from Sardinia. According to Rome Radio, Mussolini's speech lasted twenty minutes and did not mention Hitler's parliamentary address or the war situation. (Eighth, Reuters Dispatch)

### Gaeta's Commentary on the European Situation

Rome Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaeta, commented on the European situation in the newspaper yesterday, urging European countries to pay attention to the three issues he raised. If these three issues can be resolved, then lasting peace in Europe can be established immediately: (1) The recognition of people's rights must be based on justice. (2) European countries must establish a national economic order to support exchange rates between countries. (3) Reasonable disarmament must be implemented to eliminate people's fear of war. The question of war and peace has been presented to democratic countries for the last time. The subsequent situation, whether peace or war, will be decided by the democratic countries. Hitler's speech has already clearly stated this. (Eighth, Associated Press Dispatch)

Rome Gaeta wrote an article published in the Italian People's Voice, hoping that the Italian government would urge Britain and France to accept Hitler's peace offering. He said, "Italy now again asks all countries to pay attention to reality and danger. The peace that can be established after bloody battles on the Western Front cannot be greatly different from the peace proposed by Germany today. The result of the war will cause millions of people to lose their lives, and after countless destruction, the wealth consumed by the world will only be used to restore the natural conditions for genuine peace in Europe, which have already been proposed in Hitler's speech."

(Eighth, Havas Dispatch)

### Romania Works to Maintain Internal Stability

Romania and Hungary have agreed to demobilize their troops. (The border guards of Romania and Hungary have been mobilized since the spring of this year and are facing each other.) This is a major step forward for peace in the Balkans. The Iron Guard suddenly issued pamphlets yesterday opposing the government's anti-Iron Guard laws, resulting in many arrests.

### Transportation Restored in Polish Areas Occupied by the Soviet Union

Moscow People's Committee for Transportation of the Soviet Union, Pelisyupkin, issued a statement to TASS reporters today as follows: The retreating, disintegrated Polish army, under pressure from the Soviet Red Army, destroyed transportation infrastructure. They destroyed the radio station in the Verno-Baranowicz district and the Yifanfu district, the telephone and telegraph equipment in Brest-Litovsk, and completely destroyed the telephone lines in the Yifanfu area.

### European Countries: Minority Exchange Issue; German Envoy in Talks with Latvian Authorities

Paris: Well-informed sources here recently stated that when the German leader Hitler delivered a speech the other day, he said that the Germanic minorities within Eastern and Southeastern European countries should be exchanged with the minorities of those countries within Germany. This intention is probably to create an excuse to prove that Germany and the Soviet Union have sufficient reason to interfere in the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River basin countries. Observers believe that Germany's past political and economic interference in these countries had the sole goal of turning this corner of Europe into a German colony, to obtain the supplies that country needed. To achieve this goal, Hitler would sow discord among the small countries, and then annex them under the pretext of protecting the Germanic minorities. His occupation of Czechoslovakia and conquest of Poland were all such tactics. However, although Hitler speaks in terms of racialist theories, the fact that Germany has a large number of foreign minorities is somewhat self-contradictory. Hitler also said that the establishment of the German-Soviet agreement was intended to solve various ethnic problems, but according to the agreement announced by Moscow on the 29th of last month, this was not mentioned. In short, Germany and the Soviet Union are calling for the adjustment of ethnic issues, and Eastern and Southeastern European countries are already feeling uneasy about this. Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu is now in Moscow and cannot allow Germany and the Soviet Union to arbitrarily solve various problems in the Balkan Peninsula. In addition, the plans proposed by Germany and the Soviet Union are unfavorable to the Danube River basin countries, regardless of whether they belong to the revisionist or status quo. This is why these countries have launched a large-scale self-defense movement. To this day, Hungary has reconciled with Romania, and has joined hands with Yugoslavia. Turkey is busy organizing a group of Danube River basin countries. At the same time, Italy is also dissatisfied because Germany and the Soviet Union have disregarded it when defining their spheres of influence, and is happy to promote the unity of Southeastern European countries.

Latvian Capital: After German leader Hitler delivered a speech yesterday advocating the mutual exchange of minorities within countries, the German envoy to Latvia, in accordance with this idea, recently contacted the Latvian authorities regarding the return of German people in Latvia to their home country. It is reported that the Latvian government is willing to allow German people to return to Germany, but the question of ethnic Germans with Latvian citizenship is still under consideration. (Havas News Agency, 7th)

Berlin: According to authoritative sources yesterday, the issue of resettling Germanic minorities in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, mentioned by the German leader Hitler in his speech, is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. It is said that work will begin next week. Estonia currently has 20,000 Germans, and Latvia currently has 70,000 Germans. The housing problem for these 90,000 people will be solved first. Private sources reported that the German Foreign Ministry will send a senior official to Tallinn today to conclude the German-Estonian negotiations that have been going on for several days. The main issue of these negotiations is to resolve all legal issues involving the repatriation of Germans. After the above-mentioned Germanic minorities return to Germany, the entire problem still needs to be solved gradually. Building a nine-fathom high mound starts with one basket of dirt. It is recalled that Hitler clearly stated in his speech that the problem of Germanic minorities is not limited to the Germanic people in Poland. Minorities are scattered throughout Eastern and Southeastern Europe. This situation cannot be allowed to exist for long, because it is often a source of international trouble. Hitler said that this matter needs to be resolved with the Soviet Union. According to general speculation, when Posener Administrative Director Forster went to Moscow with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at the end of last month, he discussed this issue with the Soviet government. It is reported that the two sides have agreed that 70,000 Germans in Eastern Galicia, 60,000 Germans in Volhynia, and 20,000 Germans around Bialystok will be resettled in German territory before the beginning of winter. As for Lithuania and Bessarabia, each has between 50,000 and 60,000 Germans. There are about 800,000 Germans in Romania, 700,000 Germans in Yugoslavia, and 650,000 Germans in Hungary. The Germans in the Volga region and near the Vaud region are numerous, numbering about one million. What their future holds and whether there is a good solution remains to be studied and negotiated. In addition, about 400,000 Germans in Soviet Ukraine and the Volga region who successively migrated to North and South America after the European War do not seem to need to be moved back to Germany in the short term. The Germanic minorities that can be moved back to Germany in the short term are the 200,000 people in Southern Tyrol. If they agree, they may move to the Carpathian Mountains south of Krakow. As for the Jewish problem in Poland, it does not seem very important. The total number of Jews is about 3.5 million, half of whom live in areas under Soviet jurisdiction. Berlin intends to retain the land east of the Vistula River, dividing it into several areas completely for Jews to live in, granting considerable autonomy, but still within the scope of German interests. This is roughly the case. Detailed measures have not yet been determined. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

Riga: Today, a statement issued here stated that after the German leader announced his remarks on the transfer of minorities, the German envoy to Latvia, Kotze, visited Latvian Foreign Minister Munters to obtain the Latvian government's consent to repatriate Germans in Latvia. The Latvian government has no objection to this. As far as German citizens are concerned, this problem is easy to solve. However, the method is more complicated for Latvian citizens who are formally German. Therefore, it seems necessary to conclude a treaty stipulating all issues related to large-scale immigration before a solution is possible. (Reuters News Agency, 8th)

Latvian Capital: The news that Germanic minorities in Latvia will soon return to Germany has recently been published in large headlines by various local agricultural newspapers, which also said that "this matter is based on the speech delivered by the German leader Hitler and is not related to the mutual assistance treaty concluded between the Soviet Union and Latvia." Several German ships will soon arrive here to transport Germans back to their country. Foreign observers here commented on this, saying, "Germans came to Latvia as early as the 13th century. Now that they are being sent back to Germany, the Latvian people are happy to hear about it. However, these Germans are generally accustomed to living in this land. If they are allowed to freely decide their fate, at least half of them will not want to return to Germany." (Havas News Agency, 8th)

Latvian Capital: The German envoy to Latvia, Kotze, visited Foreign Minister Munters yesterday to formally negotiate the issue of Germans in Latvia returning to Germany, and to inquire about the Latvian government's consent. According to Latvian authorities, there are only 3,000 Germans in Latvia, so resolving this problem will not cause major difficulties. As for the economic interests and property of Germans in Latvia, they are also not complicated. The German government will be able to find a way to compensate the Germans for their losses. The problem that is cited as difficult is that Germans have obtained Latvian citizenship. If it is decided to return to Germany directly, Latvian citizenship must be revoked before German citizenship can be obtained. Solving this point requires a separate special agreement to be possible.

### Rumor: Polish Submarine Escapes to British Port

Swedish Capital: The Swedish "Afternoon News" reported from London that the Polish submarine Orzeł, which escaped from the Estonian port of Tallinn, safely arrived at a British port yesterday. This report has not been confirmed. The newspaper raised the following question with a skeptical attitude: How can a Polish submarine safely pass through the densely laid mines of Germany and the United Kingdom without being damaged? (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

### Czechs in France Form Troops

Paris: Former Czech President Beneš recently said in an interview with Havas News Agency that the French government has allowed Czechs to form troops within its borders, so that under the leadership of the Czech Provisional Government, they can join forces with the British and French armies to fight against the common enemy. This act of benevolence is truly appreciated. "Our nation is determined to restore its independence, and no violence can stop it." (Havas News Agency, 7th)

Prague: The German government recently issued an order to form special forces in the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia to maintain law and order, but if "major events occur that are sufficient to endanger lives," they may be ordered to be dispatched. These troops shall be led by a director-general, assisted by three inspectors and twelve battalion commanders. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

### Danish Government Bans Pork Exports to UK

Danish Capital: The Danish government has decided to temporarily ban pork exports to the United Kingdom. This is considered a major blow to Danish economic interests, because Denmark slaughters an average of 80,000 pigs per week, of which 70,000 are exported to the United Kingdom. Therefore, the slaughtering industry will inevitably suffer a major impact after the government implements the ban. Experts estimate that the number of unemployed will be between 6,000 and 7,000. Newspapers pointed out that the reason why the government took this measure was because three Danish ships were detained by German warships while en route to British ports. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

### Many French Communist Party Members of Parliament Arrested

Paris: Since the Communist Party was ordered to dissolve, 26 of the party's members of parliament have been arrested, including nine in Paris. (Note: There are a total of 81 Communist Party members of parliament.) (Havas News Agency, 8th)

### Japanese Public's War-Weariness is Rising; Plot to Assassinate Leading Figures Discovered

Tokyo: The Japanese people are now filled with war-weariness and anxiety about the vague and uneasy future. Although the war against China in the past two years has not reduced the patriotism of the Japanese people, dissatisfaction has gradually increased due to the failure of the war against China. There are two things that can express the dissatisfaction of the Japanese people. One is that the police are concerned about the mysterious movement of men wearing white robes who pray at shrines throughout the empire every evening. The other is the discovery of a plan to assassinate important Japanese figures. Religion and mysterious rituals have often caused riots and armed actions in Japan in the past. The police authorities are paying close attention to the uneasiness of the civilians, feeling that the actions of Japanese men wearing white robes and praying are quite similar to the actions of the League of Blood before the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in 1932. On July 15 this year, three people were arrested in Tokyo. They confessed to having a plan to assassinate former Privy Councilor Count Makino Nobuaki, Kurahei Yuasa, and Imperial Household Minister Tsuneo Matsudaira. Later, other plans to assassinate cabinet ministers were discovered. The people listed as assassination targets were all peace advocates and officials with great talents and abilities who opposed Japan making enemies with other countries. They used their influence to oppose the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. They also adopted a moderate attitude towards the United Kingdom and the United States. The anti-British demonstrations in Tokyo this summer can represent another aspect of the situation. At that time, Japan was not without the truth of anti-British sentiment. In the past two years, the people here have learned from newspapers, magazines, and letters from soldiers on the front lines that the United Kingdom has hindered Japan's actions in China. When patriotic groups started the anti-British movement, they immediately received the response of the people. The number of people participating in the demonstrations soon reached thousands. At present, similar anti-American demonstrations cannot be achieved. Since the United States announced the termination of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, there have been anti-American declarations in Japan, but few people responded. On the contrary, although Japan strictly enforces news censorship, the attitude of the United States is often clearly published in Japanese newspapers. Kawakami, the Washington correspondent of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, telegraphed the two newspapers, saying, "Japan must immediately prove that it respects the American people and property in China. It must prevent the recurrence of incidents such as Japanese planes bombing American schools, attacking American people, and forcibly occupying American schools. Unless Japan does this, a new treaty cannot be concluded." The Japanese people know nothing about the fact that the US government has repeatedly protested to the Japanese government about the bombing, and that the bombing continued after the protest was lodged. If the Japanese people could know this fact, the US government could make the Japanese people understand that the US attitude towards Japan is entirely due to their leaders, especially the military.

### Kwangsi Province Promotes Agricultural Production; Provincial Government's Continuous Efforts Over the Years; Attention to Sufficiency of Food While Ensuring Sufficiency of Troops

Guilin Correspondence: Guangxi is an important province in Southwest China and a rear area of long-term resistance against Japan. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of Guangxi soldiers who have already dedicated themselves to the battlefield and done their best to defend the country, the rear area's production and construction work has not been relaxed at all. Therefore, the provincial government authorities are constantly making their greatest efforts to further increase agricultural production, in order to realize their ambition of "sufficiency of food and sufficiency of troops." The plan to increase agricultural production is briefly recorded as follows:

Livestock Health Care; Breeding of Draft Cattle

Guangxi has always paid full attention to the conservation and breeding of draft cattle, one of the main tools for agricultural production, as well as other livestock, because the labor of livestock and the harvest of production are closely related in agricultural production. The death of draft cattle fundamentally affects farming efficiency. This problem was quite serious in Guangxi in the past. In September 1933, in order to thoroughly solve the epidemic of animal diseases, the Veterinary Drug Manufacturing Institute was established first. This was the predecessor of the Guangxi Livestock Conservation Institute, the main base for manufacturing drugs to prevent and control animal diseases. Later, with the Livestock Conservation Institute, such a well-organized and large-scale drug supply, technical guidance agency, following that, from 1935, all counties in the province completed the county's veterinary disease prevention and control stations. In addition, in order to improve the efficiency of technical guidance, from 1936, the Yulin, Liuzhou, Ping Le, Baise, Nanning, and five district veterinary disease prevention and control stations were set up. Needless to say, the main target of veterinary disease prevention and control is the draft cattle that supply labor for agricultural production. In order to prevent farmers from suffering economic losses due to the prevention and control of infected livestock, and to solve the difficulty of farmers being unwilling to implement epidemic prevention due to economic difficulties, the provincial authorities also formulated the Compensation for Slaughtered Infected Livestock Measures in 1938, and compensated for the price of slaughtered civilian infected livestock, so that the livestock health care business progressed further and smoothly. At the same time, measures for livestock insurance were also formulated, the promotion of livestock insurance, the promotion of livestock breeding, and the holding of stud registration, in order to improve livestock breeds. All of this directly affected the prosperity of Guangxi's livestock industry, and on the one hand, it also promoted the province's agricultural production business. Especially with regard to draft cattle, in addition to the health care work as mentioned above, the provincial authorities have also planned to breed a large number of draft cattle to meet the needs of farmers for farming.

Low-Interest Loans; Organize Draft Cattle Associations

Tianxiwan, Gang, Tiandong, Wuming, Donglan, Shanglin, Guanyang, and Gongcheng counties have been designated as breeding cattle areas in the province, and breeding cattle loans are being held. This method is being implemented in cooperation with the Agricultural Bank of China's Guilin office. The funds prepared for this loan application are 400,000 yuan, which will be handled and disbursed by the cooperative treasury of the above eight counties. The targets of the loan are organized farmers' cooperatives and mutual aid societies, etc. This is to avoid the waste of capital and increase the effect. Farmers who do not have cooperative organization are also given an opportunity to jointly organize cattle associations to request loans. In such an organization, each farmer allowed a loan can receive 40 to 80 yuan to purchase the draft cattle they need. The interest rate is only 9%, and it is repaid in four years. This is a very appropriate and effective relief for rural areas with a shortage of funds. At the same time, it is not just to loan to farmers, but if only loans are given to farmers without regular supervision and attention to disease prevention, then the purpose of breeding draft cattle cannot be achieved. Therefore, in the Guangxi Provincial Government's draft cattle breeding loan measures, it is stipulated that the cattle purchased with the loan must be injected with cattle plague prevention liquid. In order to improve the breed, the county's agricultural management offices (the organs that guide agricultural technology in a county) will carry out the work of cattle body registration, ear tagging, and bull distribution. Under such management, good results can be expected.

Increase Production; Expand Cultivated Land

Food production has always been taken care of. For example, to promote rice production, from 1938, the high-quality rice fields of Zhongshan University were introduced, and rice varieties suitable for cultivation in the province, such as Black Du No. 4, White Grain Glutinous No. 16, and Dongguan White No. 18, etc., were bred in the Xun, Wu, Yu, and Yong districts. This improved variety can increase the harvest by more than 15% compared with ordinary farmers' varieties. The first year of promotion resulted in 108,193 dan of improved varieties, which will be used for large-scale promotion. This year's harvest and increased yield will be even more considerable. With regard to wheat, in 1938, 42 counties including Quanzhou, Liujiang, and Jingxi were designated as areas for expanding wheat cultivation, with a planned increase of 10,000 mu. According to the survey, the increased area under cultivation is more than 14,000 mu. This amount cannot but be said to be quite large. As for the reclamation of wasteland, the expansion of arable land, and the accumulation of land area, it has been widely promoted over the years. From 1928 to 1938, a total of 740,000 mu were reclaimed. In 1938 alone, there were 160,000 mu. The refugees from Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Hubei reclaimed about 10,000 mu. Among these newly opened lands, most of them are naturally devoted to food production.

Winter Crops; Intensify Advocacy

In order to increase food production in greater quantities and to ensure the supply of food, the provincial government authorities have further promoted winter cultivation. Starting this year, the joint farms of various districts and counties, the agricultural supervision directors of various districts, the agricultural supervisors, the fertilizer professional supervision directors, the wheat professional directors, and the supervisors, the agricultural extension experiment supervisors, and the cooperative instructors, etc., were mobilized to do their best. It also formulated the "Outline of Measures for Promoting the Cultivation of Winter Crops in Guangxi Province" and the Implementation Measures for Promoting the Cultivation of Winter Crops in 1939. The outline and measures stipulate that the winter crops to be promoted include wheat, barley, rapeseed, taro, peas, and broad beans. The planting area in 42 counties including Guilin and Longsheng must reach two-thirds of the total cultivated land area of each county. In 26 counties including Guiping and Beiliu, it must reach more than one-half of the total cultivated land area. In 31 counties including Baise and Xilong, it must reach more than one-fifth of the total cultivated land area. This standard will be completed within five years. In order to solve the difficulties that farmers may have in purchasing winter crop seeds and fertilizers, it is stipulated that cooperatives and mutual aid societies may apply for loans. The total amount of this loan is estimated at 2,771,000 yuan in legal tender, and a simple rule for winter crop seed fertilizer loans will be formulated to deal with it. However, the solution to the fertilizer problem is not limited to loans, and it is necessary to greatly increase the production of suitable fertilizers. Therefore, the provincial authorities then stipulated the "Measures for Trial Planting of Winter Green Manure Crops and Other Winter Leguminous Crops in 1939," and the county governments purchased high-quality winter green manure crop seeds from within and outside the province and distributed them to farmers for free. These seeds, such as fat field grass and red flower grass, are expected to be distributed to 18 counties for a total of 66 dan. Such a solution to the winter crop cultivation costs and fertilizer difficulties makes it not difficult to imagine the actual expansion of winter cultivation. "Sufficiency of food and sufficiency of troops," Guangxi is moving in this direction. It goes without saying that contributing to the results of the war of resistance and national construction with the concerted efforts of the upper and lower levels can be expected. "Granaries are full and storehouses are solid," Guangxi's production and construction are advancing by leaps and bounds, and the future of the war of resistance is becoming brighter.

### Severe Drought in Qingpu; Crops Wither

Qingpu Correspondence: This summer, the weather has been cool and rainy, and farmers have been a little idle due to irrigation from the fields. However, crops in the summer should be suitable for heat, otherwise it may hinder crop development. Unexpectedly, since autumn, the weather has become hot, the cicadas are singing, the heat is suffocating, and the rainfall is also very low, causing the crops to wither. Farmers are anxious about the impending early disaster. Moreover, because of the hot and dry climate, various diseases will also occur in due course. It is heard that in the county seat and the first town of Zhujiajiao, where the population is large, an epidemic has spread.

### Sifu Suffers a Crushing Defeat Yesterday, Lido Wins 6-3

Leading 3-0 in the First Half, the Match Was Exciting with 5,000 Spectators

The Lido Football Team is actively preparing for the upcoming甲League competition. In the past two weeks, they have defeated St. Francis, tied with Sifu, defeated Portugal, and defeated East Sere, achieving remarkable results. Yesterday, they met again with the defending league champion Sifu at Aurora University and won 6-3. They scored three goals without reply in the first half. Spectators were shocked that after the previous draw, this game could be so exciting, so the crowd reached more than 5,000 people, which was the first grand occasion of the season.

One Double Team

Lido faced the sun, which hindered their vision. The Soviet army kicked off the attack, but was intercepted midway. In a flash, Qiuting made a wonderful cross. Xu Wenkui launched a fierce attack, with accurate angles. Aigensen was agile and caught it, which was a pity. At three minutes, Qixiang cut in. Asun shot without waiting for the ball to stop, and scored the first goal with a bang. At fifteen minutes, Qiuting lofted a high ball to the center, and Xu Wenkui, waiting at the twelve-yard spot, swept it in, scoring another goal (2-0). The Soviet army counterattacked.

Extremely Exciting

Duncan took a shot from 30 yards away, which was very dangerous, going out one foot diagonally. Thompson crossed, but Wilson still couldn't get past Meng Yiliang's defense line. The Soviet army's attack was just a flash in the pan. Then, Lido's forward line became active again. Qiuting single-handedly fought against MacDonald and Blaisier, and still managed to steal the ball from their feet and pass it to A'Kui, who made a well-placed volley shot. Aigensen tipped it into a corner kick, which was extremely exciting. One minute later (26 minutes), A'Kui received a pass from Jinshun and, at close to 20 yards, made another volley masterpiece, bouncing in from the crossbar, clear and beautiful. The first half ended with a score of 3-0.

Defensive Loopholes

After the break, Lido moved Li Yizhong to the front line. Although Yan Shixin had good feet, he lacked experience, so the defense was strained. Just one minute into the second half, Thompson took a corner kick, which fell right in front of the goal. The goalkeeper's vision was blocked by the two defenders, so Jie Moer calmly tapped it in, and the Soviet army pulled back a goal. In a flash, Thompson dribbled straight in and scored, making it 3-2. Within three minutes, they lost two cities in a row, and the audience was shocked. Qiuting was still able to create many shooting opportunities, but Aigensen was not weak either, making high saves and low blocks, and always responding to the ball.

Finally Won a Great Victory

At ten minutes, Wu and Xu switched positions and went deep. Yichen sent a long pass with one foot, and Qixiang rushed forward and kicked it in, hitting the post and bouncing in (4-2). The Soviet army's forward line launched a counterattack, and the Lido hinterland was frequently under fire. Although they managed to clear the danger, at 28 minutes, Zhang Lingen accidentally fouled and conceded a penalty. Thompson took the penalty and missed the first time, but finally succeeded the second time (4-3). The difference was only one goal, and the atmosphere became more tense. The defenders returned to the back line, and Yan and Huang switched places. Lido's defense was stable, and the offensive increased. At 31 minutes, Wu Qixiang went deep, and Kaimoer blocked it. Sun Jinshun swept it fiercely, and it bounced off Aigensen's body. Huang Kehou caught up, dribbled past Aigensen, and gently pushed it in. Kaimoer and Blaisier both blocked it on the ground, but finally let it in (5-3). One minute later, Sun Jinshun broke through and scored a goal on his own, creating a great victory for Lido with a score of 6-3.

### St. Francis is Getting Worse, Lost to French Business

6-2

After being defeated by East Serres last week, St. Francis was defeated by French Business yesterday. The French Business team had a change of momentum yesterday because of the presence of the small blonde. St. Francis's lineup was not ready in the first half, and Tang Marus was borrowed from French Business to fill the gap, barely forming a team. Although the old team was urgently called up in the second half, the loss was too great, and it was difficult to recover. The score was 5-1 in the first half, and the final score was 6-2, a great victory for French Business.

Economic Special Issue No. 289

### Economic Cabinet Members in the Abe Cabinet by Zhang Yifan

Mori Ōgai compared the Abe Cabinet to a "garbage collection cabinet," and Yamaura Kan'ichi titled it the "Abe Clan Cabinet." These are both realistic descriptions of the Abe Cabinet's dysfunction. I have already provided a clear analysis of the Abe Cabinet's dysfunction in my Hua Pao essay on the 7th of this month. Here, I will only examine his economic cabinet members to observe the future of his economic policies!

The main policy of the Abe cabinet's formation is "undertaking everything," arguing that this would allow it to form a powerful cabinet. This is reflected in the collective economic administration by having Nagai concurrently hold the communications and railway ministries, and Godo concurrently hold the commerce and industry and agriculture and forestry ministries. Both Nagai and Godo are from the same hometown as Abe and are also comrades in the "Current Affairs Roundtable." Among the important economic cabinet members, the Minister of Finance was chosen from the Finance Ministry, appointing Aoki Kazuo, a "minor figure." He and Kaya and Ishiwatari are known as the "Three Orthodox Birds" under Finance Minister Naito Nobusada. Before being promoted to Minister of Finance, he had already leapt to the position of Director-General of the Planning Board due to his "administrative talent," and he still holds onto that position now. Abe's reason for choosing him was also to take advantage of his talent while also rejecting the activities of Katsuta Kazue, who was suffering from "Finance Minister fever." The position of Minister of Colonial Affairs has now been entrusted to Kanemitsu Yoshibu, a cross-party member of both the orthodox and reform factions in the Seiyukai. He originally held the idle position of Vice-Speaker of the Diet, and it was precisely because he was a fence-sitter in the Seiyukai's "household news" that he was favored by Prime Minister Abe, who was trying to deal with domestic and foreign affairs with "sophistication."

Nagai as Communications and Railway Minister

Nagai Ryutaro and Abe are both "Kanazawa Domain retainers." He is related to Kido, a senior vassal of the Imperial Household, and Kido and Abe have recently become in-laws. Relying on this triangular relationship, Nagai is serving as a pillar of the Abe Cabinet. However, he is only a politician who is skilled at speaking and arguing and is simply a layman when it comes to economic administration. He has absolutely no statistical common sense. When he served as Minister of Communications in the Konoe Cabinet, he strongly advocated "nationalization of electricity," stating that "only after nationalization will there be an abundant and cheap supply of electricity." However, now the use of household lights throughout Japan is severely restricted. Therefore, Yamaura asked him in the October 10th issue of Reconstruction Magazine why his promise was not being fulfilled and pointed out that he had no experience in railway administration. Therefore, Nagai himself wanted to be Foreign Minister. It was only because of his strong anti-British color that he was not approved by the elder statesmen, so this titular position was arranged so that he could secretly assist Abe's diplomatic activities.

Godo as Minister of Commerce and Agriculture

Lieutenant General Godo Takuo, president of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, relied on his high position in the shipbuilding industry and his "sophistication" in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to enter the cabinet as Minister of Commerce and Industry and Railways in the Hayashi Cabinet. He may have more than enough ability to be Minister of Commerce and Industry. Now, Abe entrusted Godo with both the commerce and industry and agriculture and forestry ministries simply because he was from his hometown. When this news was announced, reporters asked her whether she had "confidence" in this task. His reply was "I have no choice."

Godo is an advocate of the National Socialist Party's planned economy theory. At the same time, he also courted the Eastern Army due to his position at the South Manchuria Railway. His first act after taking office was to concentrate the administrative power of export supervision in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, attempting to implement his planned merger of the commerce and industry and agriculture and forestry ministries. At the same time, he also wanted to combine the low-price policy of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry with the high-price policy of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. However, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the entire Japanese fisheries group and the agricultural and forestry national entity have already lodged a severe protest with him. If the Abe Cabinet has a longer lifespan, it looks like Godo will still have to give up the position of Minister of Agriculture to someone else.

Aoki as Finance Minister

The new Finance Minister Aoki and Kaya and Ishiwatari are the three major leaders in the Ministry of Finance. Kaya held the budget, Ishiwatari held the tax, and Aoki held the finance. However, Baba, the Finance Minister during the Hirota era, changed all of their traditional positions at once, transferring finance to Kaya and transferring both Ishiwatari and Aoki outside the Ministry of Finance. At that time, Aoki was sent to the northeast to serve as the Vice-Director of the "Manchuria Affairs Bureau." This change was a move to lure the tiger away from the mountain for Baba, but for Aoki, it formed a marriage with the position of Director-General of the Planning Board. At that time, he presided over the design of the "Manchuria Five-Year Plan" in the northeast. Later, he was placed on the position of Vice-Director of the Planning Board by Ikeda. Following his continuous efforts to "launch the National General Mobilization Law" and implement the "Materials Mobilization Plan," he was promoted to Director-General of the Board. He has already become the "General Master of Wartime Economic Control Policy" in the Japanese economic world. This title is moving and frightening in today's Japan. Relying on his past impression as the first Director of the Exchange Control Bureau, some people have different expectations of him in the present when the pound sterling has plummeted and the Japanese yen has followed suit, hoping that he can find a way to maintain the current state of the Japanese yen. At the same time, because he was responsible for the aftermath of the public debt expansion policy of the late Takahashi and therefore followed Baba, who continued Takahashi's policy of expanding public debt, another group of people expect his "tax increase advocacy" to be effective in today's extreme expansion of public debt. However, when the tax bureau under his leadership just proposed a draft of "comprehensive taxation of the second type of income (interest on public and private bonds and bank deposits, lending interest, and interest rate on debt trusts)" in mid-July, it was immediately met with unanimous opposition from all financial institutions in Japan. The financial world believes that this comprehensive taxation is absolutely contradictory to the current savings incentive policy (see the September 15th Asahi Shimbun). Aoki could only pass it off with "this case has not yet been decided."

There are really too many and too difficult problems facing Aoki: satisfying military needs and completing a plan to control China's economy require continuing to expand productivity and fully import prices. This leads to contradictions in the national budget and the materials mobilization plan, contradictions in trade policy and exchange policy, contradictions in price policy and exchange policy, contradictions in public debt policy and tax increase policy, contradictions in capital policy and export promotion policy, and contradictions in material distribution and price policy. The European war has also increased his difficulties in importing and maintaining daytime operations. The success or failure of export trade still depends on solving problems such as capital, raw materials, and labor. Because he knows that these contradictions and difficulties are the inevitable product of Japan's wartime economic system, and there is no possibility of alleviation. Therefore, he supports Abe and Nomura's plan to establish a "Ministry of Trade," attempting to transcend the restraints of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' anti-British and pro-British factions and implement trade relations to adjust diplomatic status and use diplomatic means to open up trade outlets. Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials are now threatening to resign in opposition to the Ministry infringing on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' diplomatic system. In the end, unless this group of resigning officials fails, it looks like only the new Foreign Minister Nomura will be sacrificed?

Kanemitsu as Colonial Affairs Minister

Kanemitsu Yoshibu is a businessman-type party member, originally belonging to the Seiyukai faction, but now has left the party. He has dealings with both the Kuhara and Nakajima factions, but is actually closer to Nakajima. He is currently the Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives and is the general manager of the East Asia Tobacco Company. His fence-sitting qualification in the Seiyukai has perfected his new Minister of Colonial Affairs opportunity. He was an apprentice of Kaneko Naokichi in the Suzuki Shoten. Now, he pays more than 10,000 yen in income tax every year. He is worthy of being a long-sleeved and good dancer. However, his reputation for being "afraid of his wife" is greater than his activity. Now that he has jumped onto the Minister of Colonial Affairs seat, he will probably display the spirit of hard work he used to have as an apprentice, managing "continental development" and completing the process of colonizing Manchuria and China economically.

From the state of centralization in Abe's cabinet formation and the fact that Abe has recently obtained full power to implement national mobilization, it is clear that he has the ambition to take everything into his own hands. In recent years, their upper class has been enthusiastically discussing the "administrative organization reform theory." Abe seems to be moving towards this goal. If his plan can succeed, then in terms of economic administration, perhaps a batch of agencies will be cut and merged, and the ultimate purpose is nothing more than creating an economic dictatorship like those of Johnson in the United States and Göring in Germany!

### Past Week

The black market exchange rate has been steadily rising, forcing HSBC to post higher rates; however, it tightened again at the end of the week. The previous rise, it is said, was influenced by rumors of peace talks in the market, but in reality, it was simply the result of large players entering the market. Seeing the black market rate fall to a low level and then stabilize and become firm, if they didn't seize the opportunity to release their holdings, they would be stuck with frozen funds. This is the real reason for the big players entering the market. The so-called "peace" rumors were just fabrications they concocted to deceive people. What is strange is that it tightened at the end of the week, which was right when the news of victory in northern Hunan arrived. Logically, it should have been as exciting as the domestic debt market; but in reality, it was quite the opposite, simply insane!

Rice prices have already begun to decline, and there is a possibility of a sharp drop. This is because high rice prices have long caused a significant portion of Shanghai residents to practice frugality and purchase substitute grains. Sales have long been sluggish. The problem is that the rice weevils are still unwilling to sell at a lower price what they bought at a high price! However, new grain has already entered the market in large quantities. Even if the other side continues to monopolize the source, they ultimately cannot achieve their real purpose, which is to extract exorbitant profits. With domestic cargo transport disrupted, the path for high-quality rice produced in the Yangtze River basin to be sold in Shanghai and re-exported from Shanghai has been cut off. If rice prices don't fall, Shanghai's opportunity will be limited, and their extortionate profits will be greatly impacted. In the past, because the mainland lacked rice, Shanghai was in urgent need! This gave them the opportunity to engage in extortion at will. Now, times have changed, and the opportunity the rice weevils are waiting for will not come again. Moreover, after the new rice is on the market, the extravagant Shanghai people do not welcome eating "old rice"! In short, the longer they wait, the fewer opportunities they have, and the fewer sales they will make. Therefore, the day of opening warehouses and selling off stocks is already in sight, and the sharp drop in rice prices is inevitable!

### On "Methods of Trading" and Speculation by Pan Chuandong

Mr. Chen Zhimin's book "Methods of Trading" discusses speculative trading, including speculation in securities and commodities both domestically and abroad. The book is divided into two parts: the first part discusses general principles, and the second part discusses trading techniques. However, there are several points in its content which, under the current prevailing state of speculation, may lead to misunderstandings and cause considerable harm. I would like to list and discuss them one by one and question Mr. Chen:

First, the first part of the book consistently advocates that to become wealthy, one must engage in forward trading. This concept is not very accurate and is enough to influence general psychology. Good speculative trading is a specialized enterprise, no different from any industrial or commercial undertaking. Its chances of loss and profit are equal. The truth is that speculation is a business that bears enterprise risk, and the degree and chance of loss are much greater than in other industries and businesses. In the United States, speculators who lose account for eight out of ten of the total. Because speculation "includes the ability to predict the market and the ability to bear risk." (See S.S. Pratt, The Work of Wall Street, P.81.) That is, the qualifications of a speculator must include specialized knowledge and the ability to realize cash. The so-called specialized knowledge, for example, in buying and selling foreign securities and commodities, requires a thorough understanding of the theory of business cycles and the use of numerous specialized statistics to test the current stage of economic conditions. It is also necessary to be familiar with the history and current status of the securities being speculated on, as well as the company's business and financial situation. Or understand the production and sales of the commodities being speculated on and the quantitative changes in the deliverable goods. As well as the operating rules and customs of the trading market (i.e., the exchange) during speculation. Its scope is extremely broad. Knowing the company's financial situation and the history of the securities, then the investment value can be calculated. Knowing the current economic situation and its position in the business cycle, then one can know the main trend of its market price. Knowing the changing quantity of deliverable goods and the long and short positions in the market, as well as the regulations and customs of the exchange, then one can predict temporary rises and falls. Is this kind of knowledge possessed by the average person? Is it possessed by the average businessman? Without this knowledge and blindly buying and selling, if one does not lose money, it would be against the natural order! Therefore, the opportunity for loss is extremely great when buying and selling foreign securities and commodities.

When buying and selling domestic securities and commodities: if buying and selling public bonds, one must also be familiar with the tightness of finance, the amount of current value, the financial situation, and the history of the bonds. If buying and selling yarn and cotton, one needs to be familiar with the quality of cotton, the cost of raw materials for yarn production, the import and export and value of American cotton and Indian cotton, the condition of cotton production, and the supply and demand of cotton. If buying and selling gold, one needs to know the cost of import and export, the trend of gold prices in London, the quantity and disposal of gold reserves in various countries, and the purchasing policies and value of various governments. Because gold is a rare metal, its price is determined by demand. It cannot be determined solely by the current situation. Buying and selling domestic goods, under the current circumstances, also requires very complex knowledge; and if there was forward trading before August 13th, one still needed to be familiar with the exchange's operating regulations. If one relies entirely on the advice of brokers or middlemen, becoming a puppet, then how is that different from gambling and taking chances? Gambling can result in complete loss, and gambling-style speculation also has a high chance of complete loss.

The so-called ability to realize cash means that those with long positions can take delivery of goods, and those with short positions can deliver goods. Only in this way can one avoid being squeezed by short-term rises and falls and wait for an opportunity. Now, most speculators write letters with only enough capital to make a few purchases and then use the proceeds from the cash received to pledge and buy again. Because there is little supplementary capital, any reaction can lead to extreme difficulties and enormous losses. Even without pledging, most of the funds have already been used as the price of goods. Any unfavorable rise or fall will inevitably require recognition of losses, and the opportunity for loss is also extremely great.

Forward trading is futures trading by the month; although current domestic yarn, cotton, and gold are not forward trading, they still involve the hope of profiting from the difference between buying cheap and selling dear, which is the same as securities trading in the United States. All are speculative transactions, so the statement that speculative transactions can lead to wealth must be qualified. The reason why the state allows the establishment of exchanges is originally to help industry and commerce balance prices; establishing speculation for the purpose of getting rich without specialized knowledge, and blind speculation "is not needed in society; its impact is destructive rather than constructive. All those who harm economic stability and social happiness are created by these kinds of people." (See h. A. Dicg, Stock Market, P.8.)

Specialized knowledge and real strength are the qualifications that speculators should have. And one must have experience to successfully apply their knowledge and financial resources. Therefore, speculation is by no means an easy task. But are today's speculators in Shanghai willing to have this knowledge? Otherwise, they should deeply reflect and retreat at the peak of success. Mr. Chen is misleading people with the deceptive statement that "to get rich, one must engage in forward trading," regardless of driving readers to a dangerous position, which may have an extremely adverse impact on society and people's hearts. This is the first point.

What is even more, today's speculators in Shanghai are actually hoarders. They have often profited from this, but they initially lacked specialized knowledge. Then the argument of this article seems misplaced. I don't know that the profits of today's hoarders are due to the devaluation of the currency and the disruption of transportation. Therefore, the benefits gained by today's speculators are mostly an increase in the number of currency units obtained, not an increase in the total value of currency obtained. On the one hand, hoarders profit from rising prices, but on the other hand, they actually lose from rising prices. For example, if the principal is one yuan and the profit is one yuan, then the one yuan has indeed increased to two yuan or even three yuan: but at this time the value of one yuan is only about thirty cents compared to when the speculation first started. Then the two yuan or three yuan obtained are actually only worth sixty cents or ninety cents, clearly not a profit, but a loss. This is especially something that cash speculators should reflect upon.

Second, the word "Methods" in the book title, what does it mean? Does it mean margin trading? To distinguish it from actual sales? It is truly unfathomable!

Third, the theory in the original book is too superficial. The relationship between the client and the broker is also not explained in detail. Since the original book introduces speculative methods, the obligations of the client are very important to the speculator. For example, when buying and selling American stocks, brokers can request the client to realize cash when necessary, although such situations are rare, but it is something that speculators should know and be prepared for. In addition, there are many other omissions, which will not be repeated here.

Fourth, it does not specify the dark secrets of small Shanghai money shops buying and selling small amounts of American cotton, wheat, etc. Because the small amounts are actually naked short selling. It is like the shop owner and the client gambling, but the client's opportunity to be deceived and lose is far greater than the shop owner's. Commonly known as bucket shops, they are prohibited by Chinese and foreign laws. Any transaction involving less than 50,000 pounds of American cotton or less than 5,000 bushels of American wheat is a bucket shop. Since the original book introduces buying and selling methods, it should be clearly stated to avoid people from being misled into traps.

Regarding trading techniques, which occupy a large part of the original book: it is actually just about the methods of pyramiding and averaging down. And for anyone who wants to buy and sell, first buy three or four tenths, and then complete the purchase in two more installments. However, pyramiding is only one type of trading technique. If used as discussed in the original book, losses are inevitable. Because speculation can never use only one method of pyramiding or averaging down, and it is definitely not so formulaic. Mr. Chen claims to have been in the speculative business for many years, but try asking yourself if you only used this method? In addition to this, there are many other techniques, such as testing the market, going long or short, shorting a long position, and using limit orders to protect against losses (stop loss). And the most important thing is the so-called specialized knowledge discussed earlier. In addition, such as using chart analysis to supplement the methods: they are infinitely varied and definitely cannot be followed inflexibly. Therefore, although the original book is dozens of pages long, its practical value is very small. If you want to use this as a blueprint for speculation, then there is a risk of rigidity.

At this time of excessive speculation, the impact of Mr. Chen's book may be significant. The author feels a lump in his throat and wants to speak out. In short, speculative trading is the act of predicting the rise and fall of valueless assets and then buying and selling them in order to obtain the difference in price. Predicting valuelessness is an extremely difficult task. The lower the level of predictive knowledge and experience, the fewer statistical reports that can be obtained. The more unstable the society and politics, the more opportunities for loss, and the greater the amount of loss. Today's environment is similar to this. Therefore, in addition to criticizing Mr. Chen's book, I would like to sincerely advise today's speculators to reflect on their talents and experience, and to calculate the real benefits of hoarding, and should know that the current profit is not a speculative success, nor is it a real increase in property! It is just an increase in the amount of legal currency. And should know that the current prosperity of Shanghai has reached its peak, and reaction is coming. If you want to seek real profits, you must invest in legitimate channels. Or invest in the Southwest, or create new production conversions in Shanghai. If you continue with gambling-style speculation or hoarding, once international or domestic politics take a sharp turn for the worse, the losses may be unimaginable. This is what I would like to tell today's speculators.

### The Process of Remittance Discounting: The Calculation Method is Prone to Errors by Yisu

After the Shanghai War, in order to stabilize the financial situation, the Ministry of Finance announced the Measures for Stabilizing Finance in Extraordinary Times on August 16, 1937, restricting the withdrawal of deposits. At that time, there was a shortage of chips in the market. In order to adapt to the legitimate needs of industry and commerce, the remittance system was promoted. Since the implementation of this system, those who held remittances and urgently needed cash depreciated them to realize cash, forming the so-called remittance discounting. At that time, each thousand yuan was only discounted by six or seven yuan.

Since the black market in Shanghai was established in March 1938, those who held remittance deposits did not hesitate to depreciate them to exchange for cash, so the discount rate soared. After maintenance, it began to stabilize, standing at about 50 yuan. On June 22 of this year, the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram once again restricted deposits and withdrawals, and the discount rate soared to nearly 300 yuan. Later, in order to adjust the funds of the same industry, assist industry and commerce, and stabilize the market, the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association consulted with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications and agreed that the remittance deposits of banks and money shops in the United Bank Reserve Association and the Money Industry Reserve Vault by the end of June would be allowed to be exchanged for cash at 95 percent. As of the 18th of last month, the total amount was painlessly transferred, and the legal currency chips increased as a result, and the discount rate fell invisibly.

Recently, firstly, because the near and far term exchange rates have gradually converged, the number of arbitrageurs has decreased; secondly, because the needs of all parties have become narrower, forming a surplus of supply over demand, the discount has gradually fallen, and recently, it has been hovering between 60 and 70 yuan. It seems that it will fall to the lowest number.

Although remittance discounting has been reduced a lot; it is still not easy to eliminate in a short time. Those who hold remittances and urgently need cash have to pay a premium to exchange for cash; but this type of discounting calculation often makes people neglect and lead to errors. Here is an example to illustrate it. Assume that the remittance discount is 70 yuan per thousand yuan, which means that one thousand yuan needs to be discounted by 70 yuan; it is not that one thousand yuan of remittance deposit is realized into 930 yuan of legal currency. To explain it in detail, a remittance deposit of one thousand yuan, plus a discount of 70 yuan, can get one thousand yuan in cash. Assuming there is a remittance deposit of 100 yuan, how much legal currency can be obtained? Calculate it according to the following proportional formula:

1070:100=1000:X

According to the above formula, each 100 yuan remittance deposit can get 93 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen of strong legal currency; and it is not that 100 yuan remittance deposit minus a 7 yuan discount equals 93 yuan.

### Grain Market: Rice Market Mixed, Japonica and Indica Falling, Hybrid Rice Rising

The source of Dumi rice, a total of 11 ships of new and old goods from Hexia arrived at Nangang, and nine trains of goods arrived at Jingjing, and 2,450 packages of goods were shipped and loaded. The early market sentiment was quite stable, but since the afternoon market yesterday, the sales market has turned sluggish, and the two stomachs of this township have been in an unwelcoming state, on the contrary, the buying disk is surprisingly harsh, but for the goods needed, it still shows a high price to search for them, so the market is mixed, as a result, except for the new japonica and local guest tips that have fallen by half a yuan to about one yuan, only the seed Baigi, because the arrival of goods is lacking, and it happens to be inquired, so it has risen by one yuan.

### North-South Goods: Raw Peanut Production Seen

According to Qingdao, there are only a thousand packages of old goods left, and only a hundred packages have been handled by the oil mill there, at 27 yuan. The first batch of new goods has been seen, only about twenty packages. The foreign firm thinks that the number is too small and has not handled it, and the oil mill still handles it at 26 yuan.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department Strengthened West Shanghai Defense Italian Army Also Sent Out to Patrol in Coordination Public Buses Searched

Since the police force in the crossed-over area of ​​West Shanghai was violated by the puppet organization, incidents of thugs robbing documents have been heard from time to time, and the illegal actions of the puppet police have continued to emerge. In order to maintain law and order, the Municipal Council has increased the police force in the area. The puppet police, in addition to setting up police stations in major areas, densely placing posts, and taking away the power, are now going a step further, with each police station in its jurisdiction separately conducting household surveys in the alley, attempting to collect donations and taxes. The puppet police's patrol team once inspected pedestrians at the French Concession Bridge, and recently searched public buses on Yuguan Road, obviously for other purposes.

West Shanghai police force strengthened

When the reporter patrolled the area yesterday afternoon, he saw that the number of Municipal Council patrol teams along the road had increased compared to before. From Yuyuan Road through Zhaofeng Park, Baolinan Road, Jessfield Road, and Jing'an Temple Police Station, there were Indian police horse patrol teams patrolling back and forth all day long, searching suspicious pedestrians at any time. At the intersection of Roberts Road and Singapore Road, a large number of Chinese and Western detectives were stationed, strictly inspecting trams, rickshaws, and pedestrians passing by. Along Jiaozhou Road, Singapore Road, Changping Road, Conant Road to Caojiadu, the police station dispatched two armored vehicles with four detectives in each, patrolling back and forth. The Italian army was sent out yesterday to coordinate with detectives in the area to maintain law and order.

Puppet police search public buses

Dalu News reported that yesterday (7th) night, it was learned from reliable sources that plainclothes "Dadao" police began to search the public buses of the Yangshang Public Bus Company on the crossed-over roads yesterday. These incidents first occurred in front of Hollywood Paradise on Yuyuan Road. The time was about 4:15 pm. The public bus being searched was No. 15149. According to eyewitnesses and passengers on the bus, when the bus stopped near Hollywood Paradise, there were six plainclothes people, some of whom boarded the bus with guns and searched the passengers one by one. It took about 15 minutes before the bus was allowed to proceed. The Public Concession Police Department immediately reported that it had launched an investigation. It was heard that the search team had told the passengers in the bus that they were "Dadao" police and boarded the bus to search for guns, but they found nothing.

Western girls' school was indeed invaded

On the morning of the 3rd, several puppet police officers invaded the playground of the Western Girls' School and wandered around, causing the school's female students to not dare to enter the classroom. When the reporter inquired about this from Philippe, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, on the 5th, he said that he was paying close attention to the matter. However, on the 6th, Herle, the Chief of Staff of the Municipal Council, told the reporter that the puppet police did not invade the Western Girls' School, nor did they invade other Municipal Council schools on the crossed-over roads. Yesterday, the reporter spoke with Mr. Rose, who works at International Business Company, No. 2 Beijing Road, and has two sons and two daughters who are studying at the Municipal Council's Western Public School and Girls' School. According to him, he personally witnessed puppet police wandering on the playground of the Western Girls' School on the morning of the 3rd, and immediately notified the Municipal Council's office by telephone. The bureau agreed to send more patrolmen to the school for protection. The facts are all there and cannot be denied. Mr. Rose also said that the Municipal Council's Western schools will increase tuition by 25% starting from November 1st this year, so the bureau should pay more attention to the protection of the schools.

Western woman suffered considerable loss from bandits

A Western woman, Mrs. Isakiel, accompanied by her daughter, son, and another Western woman, Mrs. Gikuber, was walking near Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road when they were suddenly robbed by two bandits wandering in the area. At that time, one of them showed a pistol to intimidate and implement a blocking command, and the three or four women were ordered to hand over their rings. Wristwatches, rings, and cash were taken. The total loss was 2,420 yuan. After obtaining the money, the two bandits whistled and fled to the area under the jurisdiction of the "Dadao Police." It has been not just once that foreigners have suffered looting by bandits in the aforementioned area. At 10:45 am last Thursday, two rings of a Western woman named Mrs. Bolige were also robbed by bandits. It is reported that the Jing'an Temple Police Station has begun to pay close attention to the area.

### Tomorrow is National Day Celebration Citywide Flag Display Institutions, Organizations, and Schools All on Holiday Donated Winter Clothing Funds Reach 200,000 Yuan

Tomorrow is National Day, and all institutions in this city, such as the Municipal Council, the Jianghai Bureau, the Special Zone Courts at all levels, the Postal Bureau, all schools, all organizations, etc., will all be on holiday as usual, and all sectors will uniformly display flags for one day in accordance with the methods agreed upon by the governments of various countries and concession authorities to express their congratulations. However, due to the extraordinary times, in accordance with government regulations, there will be no extravagant celebration ceremonies, and all citizens will commemorate the difficulties of the revolutionary martyrs in creating the republic and establishing the Republic of China. Also, at a time when the Xiangbei Battle is achieving unprecedented victory, the mood is exceptionally uplifted, and it is decided to follow the authorities' instructions not to be arrogant in victory or discouraged in defeat, to work hard, and to strive to fulfill the national duty in order to complete the great cause of resistance against Japan.

Donated Winter Clothing Funds Reach 200,000 Yuan

The National Winter Clothing Solicitation Campaign Committee stipulates that the goal of this year's winter clothing solicitation is to collect 3 million cotton vests. Due to the special environment in Shanghai, it has been changed to collecting 200,000 yuan of winter clothing funds. In recent days, all sectors have begun to promote this, and national banks have received a lot of donations. Tomorrow is the day to expand the promotion, and it is expected that the public will voluntarily participate even more enthusiastically. The National Winter Clothing Solicitation Association stipulates that the solicitation of winter clothing will end on October 31st.

Charitable organizations promote disaster relief

All relief organizations in Shanghai believe that since the order in the former war zone has not been restored and it is difficult to repatriate the refugees immediately, and the goods are too expensive and the supplies are becoming more difficult, they are following the resolution of the Refugee Relief Association to continue to solicit donations in order to achieve success. The industry association's solicitation association continues to ask the city's chambers of commerce to extend donations for another year. The township association has sent letters to various township organizations to continue to provide assistance. The Yongtong Township Association has resolved that the work of the solicitation team will continue to be carried out extensively. The citizen group is preparing for a second broadcast solicitation and recognition campaign. The Shanghai International Relief Committee's Cilian General Branch and other relief organizations believe that the compatriots have left their homes and experienced many cold and hot seasons, and their lives are painful. On National Day tomorrow, all sectors are welcome to visit or offer condolences.

Banks and money shops are closed

All member banks and money shops belonging to the Banking Industry Association and the Money Industry Association in this city will hold a holiday as usual tomorrow and will display the national flag to show their congratulations.

As for the Money Exchange Association, it is also closed as usual on this day, but its members will only display flags to celebrate due to business reasons and will not take a holiday.

### Legal Currency Value Rising Oversupply Black Market Foreign Exchange Slackening Fiercely Great Victory in Xiangbei Improving Domestic Debt Credit

After the Shanghai foreign exchange black market was manipulated by speculators, the market was unstable and volatile. Now, because national policies are managing trade more and more strictly, and due to European war relations, the import of foreign goods has declined drastically, and the export of local goods has increased after promotion. Because the exported local goods in Shanghai do not need to settle and sell foreign exchange to the government, the foreign exchange obtained by exporters is sold to the foreign exchange black market. The number of people who legitimately need foreign exchange has been greatly reduced. The market has a trend of oversupply, and the foreign exchange black market is gradually slackening fiercely. Therefore, the value of Chinese legal currency has increased in cash, which has benefited Shanghai's finance immensely. In addition, because of the frequent reports of victories in the Xiangbei War and the strong rumors of the British ambassador's visit to Shanghai for peace, general foreign exchange holders have emerged, creating today's great good phenomenon of slackening. As for domestic debt, buyers are in great abundance, and the rise of unified debt is becoming even stronger.

### Confirmed Attack on Shanghai-Hangzhou Train: Account from a Passenger Arriving from Xieqiao

Yesterday's newspaper reported on the incident of the Shanghai-Hangzhou passenger train encountering a damaged railway and fierce fighting between Japanese troops and Chinese guerrillas near Chang'an Station on the morning of the 7th at around 8:00 AM.

Haining, and Chongde

areas in recent days. Passengers waiting for the Hangzhou-bound train at Xieqiao Station around 8:00 AM on the morning of the 7th were subjected to a

Long Wait with No Train

due to the fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops near Chang'an. Suddenly, a clash also broke out between guerrillas and Japanese troops in the Wangdun Port area near Xieqiao Station, resulting in several deaths and injuries. The military station there has remained closed. There was no news about the train attack. It was not until 4:00 PM that the

Damaged Railway Tracks

were repaired. The passenger train continued eastward, arriving in Shanghai around 8:00 PM, a delay of seven hours from the scheduled arrival time.

### Post Office Stops Recruiting Women: Opposition from Shanghai Women's Circles; Earnest and Prudent Women's Work; Telegram to Authorities to Withdraw Order

Regarding the Shanghai Post Office's recruitment of junior postal workers, due to an order from the Directorate General of Posts to facilitate transfers, women will not be recruited for the time being. All circles are extremely concerned about this matter. The provisional measures for restricting the employment of female staff, the telegram from Shanghai women's circles to the authorities calling for the protection of working women, and the Post Office's reply explaining the temporary suspension of female recruitment are detailed below:

Restriction Measures

The Directorate General of Posts telegraphed to all postal administrations regarding the original text of the provisional measures for restricting the employment of female staff, stating: "Having investigated that postal duties, such as receiving and sending parcels and transporting mail, are mostly unsuitable for women, and that personnel transfers are frequent, which is also inconvenient for female staff, and during this extraordinary period, postal operations have become increasingly complex, and it is quite difficult for various bureaus to allocate the work of female staff. Approved by the Ministry of Communications, the following four provisional measures are hereby established: The recruitment of female staff in each postal area shall be limited to the Directorate General and Class One bureaus. The number of female staff in each Directorate General and its subordinate Class One bureaus shall not exceed 5% of the total number of staff in each bureau. If the number of female staff has reached the above-mentioned quota, recruitment shall be limited to men only. If there are vacancies due to female staff leaving, women may be recruited as well. Married women shall not be allowed to apply. Those who marry after entering the bureau shall be dismissed upon their impending marriage. This is to be telegraphed for your information and compliance with the above provisions. However, female staff who have entered the bureau or have passed the examination and are waiting to be appointed before the receipt of this circular telegram shall not be subject to the above two provisions. Female staff who are hired after the receipt of this circular telegram must report their intention to marry in advance and must not conceal it. Otherwise, they will be dismissed upon discovery."

Telegram to the Ministry of Communications

To Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Communications: "Promoting female employees has always been valued by the Han nation. Therefore, from government agencies to banks, companies, factories, and businesses, women are serving in various capacities. The diligence and prudence of our female staff are no less than those of men in general. Especially during this extraordinary period, they work tirelessly and strive to benefit the country and society, which is highly praised by those who are knowledgeable. Unexpectedly, a few corrupt elements in the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau proposed to imitate the measures of the Jianghai Customs, which has already changed its flag, to stop employing married female staff, claiming that it would save maternity leave pay. When this was revealed in the newspapers, fearing criticism, they adopted the proposal. Before long, the Shanghai Postal Administration went even further. During this subsequent recruitment of junior postal workers, women were not allowed to register. The reason given was that women were afraid of traveling far and that it would hinder transfers. However, the ability of our women to take risks and endure hardship has already been mentioned above. The bureau insists on creating obstacles to their advancement, showing bias and superficiality, which is truly incomprehensible. If this bad precedent is set, it will not only affect the career prospects of our women but also contradict the government's wartime policy of actively promoting women's employment. We have always admired your dedication to protecting women's employment and your tireless efforts. We dare to submit this statement and hope that you will give it serious consideration and uphold justice, ordering the relevant authorities not to refuse to employ women on the grounds that they are married or unmarried and to recruit them equally. Please also order the Post Office to allow women to participate in the upcoming junior postal worker examination in Shanghai to maintain a glimmer of hope. We await your orders with trepidation." Signed, Shanghai Women's Circles.

Directorate General's Reply Telegram

To the Shanghai Women's Circles: "Your telegram has been received. The recruitment of postal workers by the Shanghai Postal Bureau this time is for the purpose of assigning them to various locations in the Southwest to handle postal transportation and other specialized duties. According to reports from various postal areas, this type of work is largely unsuitable for women. Therefore, we have had to temporarily suspend the recruitment of women. We are replying accordingly. We hope you will understand." Signed, Directorate General of Posts.

### National Rice Flooding into Shanghai; Kunshan Source Has Been Cleared; Merchants Actively Transporting

Sources of national rice from various places have been cleared, and it is being continuously transported to Shanghai for sale. Rice shops, tea houses, and markets have an oversupply of spot goods. Japonica and indica rice prices have fallen across the board. Holders of goods are successively quoting prices and waiting to sell. The market has seen a surge in the sale of various goods this morning, with a total of about 10,000 bags of samples registered. After opening at 9:30 AM, the market was soft, and sales to customers showed a slight improvement. However, all goods have fallen by one yuan or fifty cents compared to the previous day. The highest price for new japonica rice from Jiangyin was 31.50 yuan, and the price for medium-grade indica rice from Jiangbei was 19 yuan. The market has traded a total of 6,000 bags this morning. It is learned that the late rice harvest has been abundant in various places. Currently, in addition to the large quantities of national rice being transported from Nanyang and various cities and counties along the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway to Shanghai for sale, the Kunshan source has also been cleared, and "transportation permits" have been negotiated. Merchants are actively transporting goods, which will arrive in Shanghai within days. At that time, the spot market will be even more saturated, and rice prices are expected to plummet. The Rice and Bean Industry Association is continuing to conduct weekly surveys of the rice stocks of various rice warehouses in this sector. It is reported that the city's rice stocks have been increasing due to the recent increase in sources. Therefore, it is predicted that the entire food problem in Shanghai will gradually stabilize.

### French Concession Meat Industry Engages in Slaughtering: Contract Signing in Progress

Regarding the dispute over slaughtering fees in the fresh meat industry of the French Concession, which was previously resolved through verbal agreements between both parties convened by the Political Department of the French Municipal Council, disputes have continued to arise afterward. Both parties feel the need for a written contract. As a result of negotiations between the two parties over the past few days, a draft contract has been drawn up. The main content is that the slaughtering fee will be uniformly 80 cents per pig, regardless of circumstances, and cannot be changed during the term of the contract. If pigs sent by the meat industry for slaughter, whether newly arrived or previously stored, die due to illness, the slaughterer will compensate the meat industry at 80% of their value. The term of the contract is set at three years. The formal contract signing should be completed within the next two days. Many fresh meat shops in the French Concession will join the contract. However, the meat industry has not made a final decision on the contract term.

Meeting of All Coolie Foremen

All coolie foremen in the city held an important meeting at 1:00 PM on the 8th of this month. The resolutions are as follows: 1. Request the authorities of the Central and French Concessions to uphold justice. Since the Concession authorities have advised to postpone the resumption of coolie foreman duties and wait for the authorities' instructions before setting a date for implementation, 2. Having seen news in the newspapers that over a thousand coolie foremen are requesting to maintain their livelihoods and that indica rice and foreign machine-milled rice, wheat, and chicken feed from Chang'an must be deducted for coolie labor, the aim of the more than three hundred coolie foremen's request for relief is limited to indica rice from the Yangtze River area and does not fully include foreign rice and chicken feed. We must clarify the truth and real situation and make a statement in the newspaper again. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were made.

Japanese Troops Attacked in Baoshan

Baoshan Correspondence: Recently, forty members of the Japanese Marine Corps, dragging more than ten tanks, landed at Shidongkou and advanced westward. At that time, it was raining heavily, and the tanks were moving slowly. This was learned by Lu Axiang, the leader of the Chinese mobile troops in the area. He immediately supervised his troops to attack from all sides. After three hours of fierce fighting, the number of Chinese troops increased as the battle progressed. As a result, all the Japanese troops were annihilated, with only three escaping. All the tanks were captured. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese troops in Wusong immediately sent three to four hundred men to Xiaochuansha the next day and searched village by village, but found nothing. At that time, the entire town of Xiaochuansha and seven or eight nearby villages were set on fire. For a time, the flames soared into the sky, and farmers fled in droves. When the Japanese troops saw the farmers fleeing, they opened fire, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries.

Drawing of Series C Consolidated Bonds This Morning; Payment for Drawn Bonds and Interest at the End of January Tomorrow

Telegram to the Directorate General

To Director Guo of the Kunming Directorate General of Posts: "The Shanghai Bureau's recruitment of junior postal workers this time claims to be acting on your bureau's orders, citing inconvenience of transfers and temporarily suspending the recruitment of women. It is noted that the Shanghai Bureau previously submitted a request to your bureau for the same reason to not recruit women, which was rejected by your bureau. The female postal workers who were hired last time have enthusiastically taken up their posts and are serving in the Southwest without any inconvenience. Such measures not only violate the postal examination law but also contradict the government's wartime policy of actively promoting women's employment. We dare to represent all Shanghai women and urge your bureau to adhere to its consistent position and withdraw its order. We await your urgent reply." Signed, Shanghai Women's Circles.

### Japanese Unfortunate Brothers Impersonate Soldiers to Defraud; Hechigang Brothers Arrested by Military Police; One Bamboo Sailboat Defrauded of Forty Yuan

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shinbun reported today (the 8th) that two Japanese brothers, Hechigang, 31 and 26 years old, residing at No. 14 Yuqingfang, North Sichuan Road, one of whom had previously committed a crime, have been arrested by the Japanese military police here on charges of impersonating soldiers and defrauding money. It is reported that the younger brother, in early August, impersonated a Japanese military police officer and went to Caojiadu with a Chinese man, Zhang Haipeng (transliteration), to board a bamboo sailboat, took the boatman's certificate, and forced the boatman to sell the bamboo poles on board at an extremely low price, claiming that "the Japanese army needs them." The boatman quoted 40 yuan, which the Japanese man accepted. The ship was then allowed to leave without hindrance. The elder brother had defrauded a store selling Chinese products at No. 220 North Sichuan Road.

### Explanation of the President's "Doctrine of Action"

— Kong Lingkan

The President has explained the "Doctrine of Action" very thoroughly at the Central Training Corps and has published a special book, which has been distributed for morning study. With detailed analysis and patient guidance, listening to the instructions has profoundly inspired us. However, since this book cannot be read by everyone, I will venture to interpret and elaborate on it to promote its widespread understanding so that all Chinese people can understand the "Doctrine of Action" and act accordingly.

The philosophy of action is the only philosophy of life, which no one can deny. In this world, life and procreation are driven by action. Life without action loses its driving force, not only making survival impossible but also gradually leading to the extinction of everything. To put it simply, action in life is like a machine that loses its effectiveness when it stops. People who cannot act are like those who abandon themselves to despair, who do not understand the "Doctrine of Action," and who let things take their natural course without taking action. The inevitable result is self-destruction. The ancients also said, "Envying fish in the deep pool is not as good as returning home to weave a net," which encourages people to take action. From this, it can be seen that action is a lifeline closely related to life, an important factor that cannot be separated for a moment. For the sake of human life, the well-being of the masses, the survival of the nation, and the people's livelihood, the exploration of the "Doctrine of Action" and its implementation are indeed urgent and pressing tasks. Why? Because taking action is the revolution of life.

In terms of the basic meaning of action, there are no profound or esoteric meanings. It is easy to understand. However, the prerequisite for exploring this issue is to clearly distinguish between "action" and "movement." "Movement" is not "action." Why? Because "movement" is temporary, accidental, and induced, while "action" is constant, inevitable, and spontaneous. Movement can be good or bad, but action is always good. "Action" is continuous and uninterrupted, while "movement" starts and stops at will. After clarifying the above points, one can understand the principles of action.

The President said, "Throughout history, in the universe, only the word 'action' can create 'everything'." This is truly a timeless truth. The Book of Changes says, "The movement of heaven is vigorous; the superior man makes himself strong and untiring." From this statement, it can be observed that the most prominent phenomenon in the universe, which constitutes the myriad of phenomena, is none other than the movement of celestial bodies. The so-called vigor means lasting and unchanging. If we take the movement of celestial bodies as our model, we will naturally be inspired to exert ourselves and never slacken. Therefore, understanding our position and value in the universe and acting on what we must do will inevitably lead to utmost sincerity, dedication, a natural attitude, and a firm step forward, day by day, achieving "self-improvement without ceasing." The reason why the universe and humanity can survive forever and constantly progress depends entirely on this.

True "action" is the natural principle of the universe, the natural instinct of life, purposeful, guided, and systematic. In other words, actions without purpose, guidance, or system are not only not "action" but can be described as reckless movements. Reckless movements will inevitably lead to destruction. From "those who obey Heaven will prosper, those who defy Heaven will perish," one can understand this. "Action" is the manifestation of nature, innate, and we are born to "act." We must also "act" for the sake of life. The universe is entirely within the scope of "action." As long as we identify our goals, maintain faith and determination, and strive to "act" without ceasing, there is nothing we cannot achieve. Now that we know the importance of "action," we must work hard on the "elements and spirit of action." The President said, "The elements of 'action' are wisdom, benevolence, and courage; the spirit of action is purity, dedication, perseverance to the end, maintaining composure in danger, and walking on dangerous ground as if it were level." This has already clearly indicated the correct path of "action." If we single-mindedly follow this correct path, wouldn't we achieve twice the result with half the effort! This proves that the reason why many revolutionaries in the past did not achieve effective "action" was that they did not clearly recognize the true meaning of striving for action. They often became discouraged and pessimistic when they encountered setbacks because they lacked faith, patience, and determination, and they could not overcome the difficulties of the environment with perseverance. The ancients said, "He who travels a hundred li is halfway at ninety," which refers to these kinds of people. If everyone were like this, how could the revolution succeed? (To be continued)

### Sino-Soviet Aviation to Open Soon: From Moscow to Chongqing Takes About Four Days

According to the Shanghai Times, sources in the city said yesterday (the 7th) that Sino-Soviet air services linking Moscow and Chongqing are expected to formally open soon. Flying from Moscow to Chongqing takes four days. It is noted that the proposed Sino-Soviet air services have been planned for more than a day. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation has made preparations for this purpose. However, the Soviet government, noting that 49% of the company's shares are owned by Germans, refused to allow the Eurasia Corporation to open this service. Now that the general international situation has changed and the Soviet Union and Germany have friendly relations, the main obstacle to opening air services between Moscow and Chongqing has been completely removed.

### Brothers Involved in Lawsuit Over Garment Shop Manager; Both Sides Maintain Their Positions

The Jiatai Garment Shop at No. 262 Avenue Joffre is the ancestral property of the Weng family from Chaozhou who reside in Shanghai. It has been passed down to this day, and its business is still thriving. Recently, members of the Weng family, Weng Guangxin (35 years old), Weng Guangyong (38 years old), Weng Cai (44 years old), and Weng Guiying (38 years old), suddenly became dissatisfied with the current manager, Weng Guangzheng (33 years old). On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, they stormed into the shop without asking questions and

Forcibly Took Over

the shop, driving Weng Guangzheng out. Weng Guangzheng reported the incident to the French police, who dispatched detectives to No. 26 Taiheli, Route Cardinal Foch, and arrested Weng Guangxin and the other three. They were taken to the police station and transferred to the Second Special Court yesterday, where Judge Wu of the Eighth Criminal Court interrogated them. The police requested an extension, stating that the investigation was not yet complete. The defendants successively claimed that the plaintiff, Weng Guangzheng, was their younger brother. All the property of the Jiatai Garment Shop was ancestral property and was jointly owned by them. Recently, they discovered that the plaintiff had

Intended to Seize

the property and had secretly embezzled funds and engaged in prostitution and concubinage. Therefore, after a family meeting, they issued a statement in the newspaper to dismiss the plaintiff and elected the defendant, Weng Yunxin, as the manager of the shop. On the day of the incident, they went to take over the accounts and did not rob the shop. They requested a clear investigation. The court, after verifying the situation, noted that both sides maintained their positions and ordered a rescheduling for further questioning. The defendants were released on bail pending review.

### Lecherous Monk Instigates Runaway; Still Trying to Deny; Civil Trial Opened Yesterday

Sun Lanzhen, 35 years old, the beloved concubine of Yang Shizhi (styled Yunwu), from Gaoyou, who had served as a magistrate in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong during the warlord era, took refuge in the Sanjiao Leshan Temple on Route Pere Robert last year. This led to her being

Enticed into Adultery

by the abbot, Wan Yuan (secular name Jun Changyao, 30 years old this year). Yang discovered this and moved her to No. 3, Lane 44, Route Doumer. On May 28th of this year, Sun, incited by Wan Yuan, ran away, taking with her 2,500 yuan in cash and three pairs of gold bracelets, and fled with the monk to Hangzhou. Later, they traveled to Shanghai. Yang reported the incident to the police, who arrested Wan Jian and Sun and sent them to the Second Special Court for prosecution. Yang also filed an incidental civil suit against Wan Yuan, seeking damages and the recovery of the stolen goods, totaling over 6,600 yuan. As a result, Wan Yuan was sentenced to six months in prison.

Incidental Civil Suit

Transferred to the Civil Court. Sun was sentenced to three months in prison, suspended for two years. All these details have been reported in this newspaper. The civil suit against the monk Wan Yuan was transferred from the Criminal Court to the Civil Court. Judge Yu Changzi opened the court the day before yesterday for further review and summoned Sun to testify. Sun testified with tears in her eyes that she was fooled by the monk and ran away with 1,000 yuan in cash and gold bracelets, which were all taken away by the monk. The money was lent to his teacher, Abbot Qinliang, to

Buy Leshan Temple

property. The defendant initially said that he would treat me well after I got out, but after I got out, he took the money and gold bracelets and ignored me. I suffered for him and ruined my reputation. I beg you to investigate him severely. When questioned, Wan Yuan vehemently denied instigating the runaway, claiming that the plaintiff had conspired to frame him, etc. The court

Angrily Reprimanded

the defendant, saying, "You are a monk, and you have harmed people like this. Now, in court, you should look at Sun and speak with a little conscience. Do you think you can get away with denying everything?" Wan Yuan was speechless. As a result, the court, finding that the case still required investigation and the summoning of witnesses, ordered a rescheduling for further review. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Evil Mother-in-Law Affects Marital Relationship; Inability to Cohabit Leads Husband to Sue for Divorce; Judge Explains the Great Principles and Persuades Reconciliation

Qian Bilan from Ningbo, 25 years old, married Chen Fengying, a woman of the same age from the same village, in 1934. Since their marriage, the couple's relationship had been relatively harmonious. However, his mother, an old-fashioned woman, was stubborn, leading to animosity between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. This affected the small couple's relationship, and after a long time, it broke down. Chen Fengying then used the excuse of returning to her mother's house to

Never Return

Qian sued for cohabitation in court, and after three trials, the court ruled that she should cohabit. However, Chen was still unwilling to return to her husband's house by the time the execution date arrived, and personal lawsuits cannot be resolved through forced execution, so there was no result. Qian then filed a lawsuit for divorce in the Civil Court of the First Special Court. Judge Li Hu of the Civil Court opened the court yesterday for questioning. Chen Fengying arrived in court with lawyer Wu Shoucong. After Judge Li's investigation, he discovered that

There Was No

ill will between the two couples. The only problem was the minor relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Thereupon, he patiently advised the Qian couple, explaining in detail the way of being a husband and wife and how to maintain love. These were the kinds of remarks that are usually difficult to hear. Finally, he also advised Chen, saying that a mother-in-law is bound to be older, and older people inevitably

Talk Too Much

As a daughter-in-law, one should accept what she says, even if it slightly violates reason, in order to please her. If it is truly unreasonable, one should turn a deaf ear and never argue with her, which would create a bad situation in the family. You should know that you are now someone's daughter-in-law, and you will inevitably become someone's mother-in-law in the future. If your daughters-in-law also argue with you repeatedly,

How Would You Feel

If you can think of the past and the future, then branches and leaves will naturally be avoided. After listening to the advice, the Qian couple expressed their gratitude and indicated that they could reconcile. The court then ordered a rescheduling, advising them to quickly discuss the details of the reconciliation outside the court. If the reconciliation fails, the court will summon Qian's mother to court for further advice at the next hearing so that the two parties can reconcile.

### Attempted Forcible Eviction Fails; Instigating the Public to Intimidate; Three Offenders Sentenced and Suspended

Mrs. Hachai, a Russian, previously rented Room B, No. 703, Escort Apartments, Jing'an Temple Road, from the Taylor Company for the purpose of teaching students. The Taylor Company then demanded a rent increase, leading to a lawsuit. As a result, the Taylor Company lost the lawsuit, and the company, ashamed and angry, instigated the Russians Ivran Toprovsky and Wan Dianliwei to use various forms of intimidation and interference with the exercise of rights against Mrs. Hachai, in order to make it impossible for her to live in peace. Hachai, unable to endure the repeated insults and the damage to her property, had no choice but to hire lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to file a lawsuit against Ivran and the other two, detailing their various misdeeds in the complaint. After detailed questioning by the First Special Court, a verdict was announced yesterday, sentencing Ivran and the other two to two months of imprisonment each, suspended for three years as a warning.

### Incensed Husband Chops Wife's Leg Due to Her Romantic Tendencies

Zhang Fuxing, from Qingjiang, aged forty-five, residing at Lane 44, No. 74, Pei Kai Er Road, Hongkou, married a woman surnamed Ma, now thirty-six years old. Although past her prime, she still possessed considerable charm and was fond of applying makeup and parading through the streets. Compared to Zhang, they barely resembled a married couple. Recently, Ms. Ma frequently stayed out overnight, and her attire became increasingly modern, losing all semblance of her humble origins. This aroused Zhang's suspicions, leading him to believe that Ms. Ma was having an affair. However, he dared not openly question her. Until the night before last, Ms. Ma again failed to return home all night. Zhang's anger reached a boiling point. He hid a sharp axe in the house and waited. Yesterday morning, around 7 a.m., she finally sauntered home. Zhang, who was concealed inside, immediately swung the axe at her legs as she stepped through the door. Caught completely off guard, Ms. Ma had her left ankle severed and her right leg also injured. Overwhelmed by pain, she fainted, and blood flowed profusely. Upon hearing the news, her neighbors immediately reported to police post No. 334. The police arrived and apprehended Zhang, along with the weapon. The injured woman was rushed to Shanghai East Hospital for treatment. It is reported that due to excessive blood loss, her life is in danger.

### Jewish Refugee Unrepentant, Assaults Rickshaw Puller, Refuses to Pay Fare and Verbally Abuses Victim, Arrested, Tried, and Sentenced to Four Months in Prison

Gudna Bao, a Jewish rickshaw puller for the German Shanghai Transportation Company, colluded with his brother Louis Nazeer on July 15th of this year, at the Jewish Refugee Camp No. 100 on Jingzhou Road, to bite off the left ring finger of refugee Wei Hanhefu. They were arrested and brought before the First Special District Court. They were found guilty of jointly inflicting bodily harm and each sentenced to eight months in prison, but due to their status as first-time offenders and their employment, the sentence was suspended for three years. Unexpectedly, the defendant Gudna Bao remained unrepentant. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, at 4 p.m., he hired a rickshaw at the Bund Customs Wharf and had the puller take him to the southern end of the Outer Baidu Bridge. Rickshaw puller Shi Langcai reached out to collect the fare. Gudna Bao refused to pay, saying that if he wanted money, he should follow him to the northern end of the bridge, and if he didn't have a pass, he didn't need to pay. Shi Langcai refused to let Gudna Bao cross the bridge and was punched in the face. Fortunately, a Chinese constable arrived and apprehended him, and he was taken to the police station. Western Detective Secretary Si investigated. The defendant even claimed that it was okay to beat a Chinese pig. The police sent him to the First Special District Court and charged him with assault. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu represented the police and requested a heavy sentence because the defendant had fled to China as a refugee and still insulted the Chinese as pigs. Since he knew the Chinese were pigs, why did he flee to China? The judge, after considering the circumstances, sentenced Gudna Bao to four months in prison for inflicting bodily harm. The defendant was handed over to the execution court for processing.

### The Ingenious Use of Advertising in Dongmei New Village

— A Sojourner from Huatun

Since the mutual slaughter between the Red and White armies in Spain in 1936, the turmoil of war has suddenly shaken the north and south of Asia, and then extended to the east and west of the world. Among the five continents, the only place that can be compared to a paradise on earth is the Americas. For a time, the major entrepreneurs of the European capitalist world all strove to dispose of any movable property that could be sold and sought to encompass all of it to invest in the United States, seizing opportunities. Therefore, the new strategies of commercial warfare in the United States are worth recording.

Generally, dictatorial countries control everything, while democratic countries tend to favor freedom everywhere. The two go in opposite directions, with both advantages and disadvantages. Americans are awash in gold and uphold democracy in politics, and private enterprises can easily expand their freedom to their satisfaction. Business competition is exceptionally fierce, and advertising methods are particularly ingenious. Scenic spots and famous areas are filled with commercial colors, and street corners in residential areas are often dotted with small shops. The dazzling advertisements in the center of large cities, or the electric billboards, constantly overwhelm people, leaving their eyes with no rest. The advertisements are of numerous types. Foreign guests, after a long absence, return and spend a night in ports such as New York and San Francisco. The patterns and objects that can be glimpsed on streetcars and public vehicles are captivating. Travelers' horizons are broadened, and they often feel "the illusion of having read ten years' worth of books." This is far superior to the Jiangzhe hinterland of twenty years ago, where all advertisements were tax-free, and foreigners acted arrogantly, posting them everywhere and damaging the beautiful scenery of China. As for Americans suddenly developing desolate places into new villages, even expanding them into towns, or even turning towns into large famous cities, with individual enterprise as the driving force, sometimes the financial fortunes are smooth, making it easier to develop than in the European hinterland, where it is inconvenient to buy land and build houses at will. For example, Virginia, outside Washington, D.C., still has much open space. Entrepreneurs seize opportunities and purchase land along both sides of the highway. Once the payment is completed, they first build one or two "elegant but small" pigeonhole-like fine houses in the latest style, with everything inside, such as wall cabinets, fireplaces, gas stoves, refrigerators, and central heating throughout the house, supplied by kerosene for boiling water. Outside, there are balconies with iron wire grids. At the same time, posters are placed along the roads, and advertisements are placed in newspapers, specifying convenient methods of monthly installment payments over a period of ten or twenty years, in order to attract middle-class residents. If running guests are willing to come, they can freely view this pre-built model house. Even the good names of the new villages have advertising effects, such as Hillwood, Sunny Side, and Linden Lane. From the name, it is easy to see that the environment of the new village is conducive to health, and the planning is thorough and meticulous.

### A Suggestion to Launch a "One Bowl of Vegetables Movement" on Double Ten Day

— Qiulang

Like flowing water, the Double Tenth National Day of the 28th year of the Republic of China is approaching tomorrow. At the same time, it is also the anniversary of the resumption of publication of this newspaper. In theory, on this doubly festive date, a few auspicious words of blessing should be said; however, upon reflection, this newspaper seems to be a respected elder. In terms of age, it is indeed a veteran of over sixty years, but its innovative thinking and rich knowledge are far beyond the grasp of shallow juniors! It certainly has a genuine value to celebrate, and there is no need for me to prattle on. As for the Double Tenth Festival, it seems like a patient suffering from many diseases, who has no interest in holding a birthday celebration! The national crisis is severe, the scars are all over the place, and the suffering of the people is increasing! In floods and wars, countless lives and properties have been lost! The surviving remnants are struggling to survive, but prices are soaring, and life is becoming increasingly difficult. It is truly pitiful. According to recent reports, the refugee relief association, due to financial difficulties, is about to close down various shelters. This is truly unfortunate news for the refugees! However, there is also the text "Urgent need for donations to call for sponsorship," which shows that those concerned are still racking their brains to find a way and are still trying their best to maintain the situation!

Mr. Luo Qifu, the chairman of the American Relief for Chinese Refugees, recently launched the second "One Bowl of Rice Movement." Our friendly countries are still willing to help us, which is admirable! Now, I humbly propose that we launch a "One Bowl of Vegetables Movement." Vegetables are auxiliary foods for rice and porridge, and can be as rich or as frugal as desired. Wealthy families eat delicacies from the mountains and seas. When there are banquets, even more delicacies are displayed. As the saying goes, "A feast for a rich family is half a year's worth of food for a poor man!" Middle-class families also have five or six dishes per meal, and some families follow the economical menu of Miss Hua Ying in this publication, so they also have dishes to eat every meal. Although the "One Bowl of Rice Movement" is relatively simple, the "One Bowl of Vegetables Movement" is more complicated, because vegetables can be meat or vegetarian, and prices can be high or low. But regardless of the details, I urge the virtuous family members to eat one less bowl of vegetables starting from Double Tenth Day and donate the money saved to refugees. This will be a merit! As for thinking of "One Bowl of Vegetables" from "One Bowl of Rice," or inevitably following the same pattern, I will not bother to consider it.

### Too Much and Too Little

Japanese parents have the strictest restrictions on their children's diet. However, the greater the pressure, the stronger the reaction. Once they reach adulthood, they indulge in excessive eating and drinking, so many people in that country suffer from stomach ailments. Our country is just the opposite. Parents are afraid that their children will not eat enough. During the New Year and festivals, they are allowed to eat as much as they want. Their delicate stomachs cannot bear it, and nineteen out of ten pediatric clinic visits are for gastrointestinal problems. As for the children of wealthy families, who often die young, it is also due to overeating. (Xin Fo)

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

For the past two months, due to the soaring price of rice, everyone has felt a bit burdened by three meals a day. However, we cannot become immortals and abstain from food. We still have to eat. So, helplessly, we have to buy some cheaper flour to mix with our rice. Flour can be used to make many things, such as noodles, steamed buns, dumplings, and pancakes, which can all fill your stomach. However, there is one thing that everyone must be especially careful not to eat too much, and that is flour dumplings (mian ge da). Flour dumplings are the easiest to make, and they do not need to be fermented, so many families eat them, but they are also the most likely to cause problems. I have several relatives and friends who have suffered from gastrointestinal diseases from eating flour dumplings and spent a lot of money on medical treatment and medicine. They wanted to save rice but ended up spending a lot on medicine. Where did that come from? Originally, flour dumplings are particularly solid because they are not fermented. People with weak stomachs who eat them will accumulate them in their stomachs and intestines, unable to digest them. All ordinary digestive medicines cannot digest them, and they have to have an enema every day, which is really painful. So, I would advise readers to eat fewer flour dumplings. It is better to roll the flour thinly and make some "pian er tang" (noodle soup), which is better. All kinds of side dishes, whether shredded pork, shredded beef, or vegetable tips, can be added to the soup, and they are all delicious. However, you should not eat too many "pian er" either. This is what everyone should pay attention to.

### The Clothing and Food of Mahatma Gandhi, the Holy Man of India

— Yu Xiangyun

Mr. Gandhi, the leader of the All-India National Congress, is a strong, brave, tenacious, and upright elder who has made a good impression on the minds of people all over the world. Whenever he encounters political disputes, he uses his only weapon of peace—fasting—which can gain the sympathy of oppressed peoples.

This striving and progressive old gentleman is already seventy years old. The second day of this month is his seventieth birthday. British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Mr. Eden, as well as professors Reffler and Einstein, all sent telegrams to a certain place in New Delhi to offer their congratulations, which shows his high reputation. Here, I will briefly discuss his past private life and sustenance.

A person who is old and still in good spirits must have good living conditions to achieve this. This is an unbreakable law. Mr. Gandhi's private life is simple, without the air of wealth and dignity, but he pays attention to hygiene. Cleanliness and comfort are his only advantages.

India is located in the tropics, so his clothing does not need to include leather, cotton, padded, single, and gauze materials to cope with the climate, as we do. He wears a white silk coat for at least eight consecutive months. Only in the cooler months does he switch to cotton clothes that he has spun himself. He has never worn a gentleman's tailcoat or expensive leather shoes. He has never worn gloves, and he has not even used the cloth head covering that the Indian people like to wear since middle age. He has a bare head and bare feet all year round (sometimes wearing straw sandals). It goes without saying that he does not wear the rice bucket-style top hat or the morning and evening dress.

His mental strength relies entirely on food rich in nutrients to support him. He cannot fast. Once he fasts, his spirits decline, his blood pressure rises, and his mind becomes muddled. However, he can use the weapon of peace to gain many benefits for the Indian nation. He usually needs: goat's milk, eggs, coconuts, coffee, rice, wheat, fresh fruits, beef, fresh fish, corn, etc. He eats bread, but he does not eat butter or jam. He can eat plain bread. He also likes to eat rice and fish from the Bay of Bengal. He does not smoke or drink, and he eats spicy food sparingly.

Although he has an old wife, they are not often together. His daily diet is entirely entrusted to the servants and cooks. Even if the food they make is not very tasty, he does not rebuke them, unlike the arrogant wealthy and dignitaries.

In addition, not wearing or eating foreign things is also a rare characteristic of him.

### Rice Shop Owner Is Honest and Easily Deceived; Manager Conspires to Defraud

They Secretly Transported White Rice from the Shop for Sale and Profit Sharing; They Also Closed the Rice Shop and Fled; Finally, They Were Caught

Ding Nanguo, from Chuansha, opened a rice shop named Kaifeng at No. 138, Linqing Road, Yangshupu, in July of this year. He hired Tang Xueren, from Baoshan, as the manager, and Ye Guisheng and Gu Xiaoyue as assistants. Unexpectedly, these people thought that Ding was honest and easily deceived. They colluded with each other and conspired to defraud him. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, they secretly transported 60 bags of white rice, worth more than 1,500 yuan, to Baoshan and entrusted Zhao Rentai, a fellow trader, to sell it on their behalf, and they shared the proceeds. They also used a small cart to transport four dan of rice stored in the shop to a secret location between them on the 28th of that month, intending to close the rice shop and flee without a trace. Later, shop owner Ding Nanguo reported the information to the Yangshupu Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest the three shop assistants, Tang, Ye, and Gu, one after another, and detained them in the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan requested that they be taken into custody. Ding Nanguo then proved the process by which the defendants had defrauded and misappropriated funds. When Tang, Ye, and Gu, the three defendants, were questioned, their statements were vague. Judge Huang Changsheng ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory predicted at 4:30 PM yesterday that the weather around Shandong would be sunny with wind from no particular direction. Here and in the East China Sea, it will be cloudy and sunny, with winds from the southeast to northeast. There will be cyclones and showers around northern Luzon. The center of the hurricane at 2 PM was located within 60 miles of 18 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude. The wind direction is northwest, and the wind force is strong. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 85.6, and the lowest was 65.3. On the same day last year, the highest was 81.5, and the lowest was 69.3.

### The Eve of National Day

We are living in safety on "Isolated Island," and we are about to have another National Day commemoration without any ceremony. However, we are not pessimistic. We believe that final victory belongs to China, and it is getting closer day by day. The unprecedented victory in the Battle of Changsha and the military blows dealt to the Japanese army on the northern front happened to be transmitted to Shanghai on the eve of National Day, which makes us believe even more that on this day next year, we will no longer be silent. The birth of a new China will be an unprecedented grand celebration. We will make people of all countries in the world look at the Chinese nation with new eyes and dare not deceive or plunder us again.

Although this year's National Day commemoration cannot hold any celebratory ceremonies except for raising flags, the collection of winter clothing will begin on October 10th. People on "Isolated Island" should pay special attention to this. The soldiers on the front lines have been fighting for us for two years and four months, and have shed countless blood and lost countless lives. We on "Isolated Island" should at least do what we can, "contributing money if we have money, and contributing effort if we have effort," to comfort the soldiers on the front lines and increase the national strength of resistance. On the eve of this National Day, let us no longer hesitate or delay, but quickly join the collection movement and actively donate winter clothing and money.

What makes us particularly grateful are the people of our friendly nation, the United States, who are far away across the Pacific. On the eve of this Double Tenth Day, in order to relieve Chinese refugees and comfort Chinese wounded soldiers, they are holding a One Bowl of Rice Movement across the country, donating the money they save to China. At the same time, the authorities in New York have stipulated that this year's Double Tenth Festival will be "China Day" at the New York World's Fair, so that people around the world can know that China's resistance has continued for two years and four months, and it is still getting stronger and stronger. Although Japan has ambitions, it cannot destroy China. In addition to expressing our gratitude to our American friends, we should also ask ourselves on the eve of National Day: people are enthusiastically helping us, have we done our part, and are we all working for the country? If not, from today onwards, let us no longer live in a drunken stupor and implement "contributing money if we have money, and contributing effort if we have effort," using the financial resources of the whole people to make China's final victory a reality sooner!

### Ningbo Wife's Good Fortune by Huang Ziqiang

The Ningbo wife in the front building is the luckiest one in this shikumen building, everyone says so, everyone envies her. Isn't that so? She's young, her husband makes good money, they got married in the winter of the year of the war, and now their child is babbling and learning to talk.

A total of six families rent in this shikumen building, all small businessmen and the most basic salary earners, living in sighs on this "isolated island" where rice is as precious as pearls and firewood is as expensive as cassia. The man in the small attic has been unemployed for several months, watching him leave early every morning and return home late, finally with no hope of finding a job. His two children often cry and clamor about being hungry—they must be the most miserable family in this shikumen building.

This further highlights the Ningbo wife's good fortune. She doesn't worry about clothing, and every day at lunchtime, either she goes out herself, or her relatives and girlfriends come to play cards. The laughter and card game sounds from the front building make everyone even more envious of the Ningbo wife's good fortune.

The Ningbo wife's husband rarely comes home, and even when he does, he doesn't stay for more than a day or two before leaving again. The Ningbo wife, his wife, can't even name his profession, but it's generally a good job on a ship. The Ningbo wife sometimes chats with the landlord, and she says:

"Working on a ship is really a good job. They sail every ten days or half a month, and he can always earn more than fifty dollars—and that's just his regular pay! He also does business on the side, making another twenty or thirty dollars in extra money per trip. And at the end of the month, there's another bonus, which his colleagues on the ship split up. When things are good, it can be eighty or a hundred dollars... I don't even know what his job is? Anyway, working on a ship is really a good job!"

This is also what everyone sees. Every time the Ningbo wife's husband comes home, he always carries large packages of things, fruits, dried goods, even meat and fish... just buying these things would cost at least ten dollars.

"Good fortune! Ningbo wife has good fortune!"

The lucky Ningbo wife really knows how to enjoy life. Playing cards every day isn't enough, and recently she's learned a new form of gambling. She bought a mimeographed booklet and reads it, and she also goes to the temple to seek fortunes and ask about divination, and talks about her dreams every day. The nanny hardly ever holds the child, and spends all day running errands for her mistress five or six times, sometimes going all the way to Caojiadu, which is far away.

Everyone in the shikumen building knows what kind of gambling this is. Perhaps the hope of making a huge profit also flashes through their minds. Whenever they see the nanny running back with a smiling face, everyone whispers about how much money the Ningbo wife has bet.

But the Ningbo wife doesn't care. "Just playing around, it's more fun than playing mahjong," she always answers when people ask her about her winnings and losses.

Playing around like this gradually excites the Ningbo wife, and when she starts playing seriously, she becomes dissatisfied with the days when her husband comes home. She tells the nanny and asks the other families living there not to mention this interesting gambling in front of her husband. According to what the nanny tells people in private, the Ningbo wife has lost quite a bit of money.

Recently, the laughter and noise from the front building have stopped. All you hear is the sound of the child crying and the Ningbo wife scolding the nanny.

The only lively front building in this shikumen has also gradually been shrouded in a cloud of sadness.

"Ningbo wife has good fortune," some people are still saying behind her back, but, "She doesn't know how to enjoy her good fortune, she's really bringing it on herself!"

A work by Mr. Gu Yanbu

### Shanghai's Shantytowns by Mangmang

Perhaps yearning for the prosperity of Shanghai, they rowed a small boat, fully loaded with local products, to the Huangpu River.

However, the Huangpu River is a place for steamboats to race, and small boats can only drift in the sewage ditch.

Right there, next to those things like cigarettes and sedans—in a place reeking with foul odors—the boat dropped anchor and berthed.

The sewage dried up, and the bottom of the boat rotted. How could it do business? So, feet grew under the boat, standing high on the sewage river. This was property brought from the countryside. Who would take care of it? This was a place that urban women didn't want to go to. Who would be happy to manage it?

Sparks ignited in the nearby wilderness, and straw sheds made of yellow mud were built one after another. There were no door numbers there, and no house tax was paid. It looked a bit like the countryside. It's just that when you looked up and gazed into the distance, there were a few more chimneys in front of you.

They, these shantytown dwellers, didn't know how they should live in this flowery world. They just relied on their two hands, doing what they knew how to do: sculpting clay figures, raising piglets, making paper flowers, carrying loads on shoulder poles...

Slowly, their lives were infiltrated by the air of civilized people. When the head-splitting sound of looms broke through the dawn, the silk factory girls wiped their faces, applied a little rouge, climbed out of their earthen-cave-like sheds, and jumped into the sound of the machines.

Slowly, they pulled rickshaws, carried packages, and became foremen...

But, the lives of some of them still remained in a primitive society. Savage, ignorant of the law. Rape, forced marriage, clan fights... were happening there.

"These are all scum, robber scum!" Gentlemen and ladies covered their noses as they passed by, casting contemptuous glances.

These scum, robber scum, finally, like the gentlemen and ladies, destroyed their nests and wandered into areas with no security.

Right next to the barbed wire fence, in a place scarred by bullets and with collapsed houses, they built their new homes. Like pigsties, the outside was surrounded by a crooked bamboo fence, and inside was a string of thatched sheds less than a person's height. In the walkways, stagnant sewage was everywhere, and old clothes hung all over.

They were still pulling rickshaws, being silk factory girls, carrying packages...

But when gentlemen and ladies passed in front of the shantytowns, they not only covered their noses, but their tone was even harsher:

"These scum, robber scum, all the unforgivable things in Shanghai are done by this bunch of scum!"

So, they picked up sticks to drive them away. Where could they be driven to? The refugee camps couldn't accommodate them. They were also used to working freely and couldn't stand being restricted. They could only be scolded, and like mange-ridden lice, they squeezed together there, and they would live like this forever!...

### Chapter Sixteen Planning to Promote Medicine and Create Scholars, Considering Village Governance and Entrusting Children with Care

Village Chief Zhu said, "There's one more thing. You should discuss it with Doctor Zhang. Yesterday, at our village council, someone proposed a motion to open a nursery in the village. This motion was proposed last year and has been kept in reserve. This is because Freedom Village really needs a nursery. Often, many mothers cannot work because they have infants. And when there are many children, they can't take care of them themselves, so they leave them at home, causing the children to get sick. But to carry out this matter, we need talent and money. If we use village funds, we don't have that budget. Now someone has proposed it again, and I think we will eventually have to do it. Now the population of Freedom Village is increasing day by day. This month, it has increased by seventeen households and one hundred and eight people compared to last month. Every month, it's more than the previous month. If Freedom Village opens factories again, we can immediately have several thousand more people. If the He sisters open a silk weaving factory in Freedom Village, they will definitely recruit many female workers, making a nursery even more essential. So please discuss with Doctor Zhang, for example, how much would it cost to set up a nursery in our village per year? How many children can it accommodate? We are a village, so we can't have a large-scale nursery, and we don't need complete equipment, just something that's adequate. Secondly, discuss with the two He sisters. Will they also need to set up a nursery in their factory in the future? Can we cooperate with them? If we were talking to a stranger, they would laugh at us. The factory hasn't even opened yet, but we're already discussing this kind of thing with them. Fortunately, the He sisters are like family, so it doesn't matter if we ask them. Because our village's economy strives for practicality, and we can't waste a single penny!" Village Chief Zhu's words are very correct. Although it is a village self-governing, like a country on a large scale, and like a family on a small scale, one must measure expenditures against income, and measure income against expenditures. What should be used must be used, and what should not be used must not be wasted. Before the war, China had no so-called local autonomy. Although there were areas and names of a village, who cared about it? All education, sanitation, agriculture, production, etc., were also left to nature. Scraping money from the villagers, they would think of various methods, at every turn it was some donation, some donation. And there were those surtaxes, often the principal tax was only one dollar, but the surtax was added to three or four dollars, which could truly be called "the chick is bigger than the hen." After scraping money from the villagers, would they do something beneficial for the villagers? Don't even think about it! And there were those village directors and the like, all of them were accomplices of tigers, helping evildoers, this group of people were all parasites on the landlords. (189)
