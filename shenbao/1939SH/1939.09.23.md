### Demarcation of the Border within Poland: Germany and the Soviet Union Establish a Provisional Agreement; The Land Acquired by the Soviet Union Accounts for Half of Poland's Territory; Voroshilov Scheduled to Visit Berlin This Month

Moscow: Following the arrival of the German military delegation here yesterday, negotiations were immediately held with the Soviet authorities regarding the demarcation of the border within Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union. It is reported that a provisional agreement has been established, and a practical border will be demarcated through diplomatic channels in the future. The delegation is scheduled to return home tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin: This afternoon, the official announcement here stated that the German government and the Soviet government have demarcated the boundary between the German and Soviet armies. The boundary follows the Pisa River, the Narew River, the Vistula River, and the San River downstream. The Pisa River is a tributary of the Narew River, flowing south from Johannisburg in East Prussia, and meets the Narew River in Nowogród. The Narew River was an important defensive line for the Russian army during the First World War, and it was also an important defensive line for the Polish army during this war. The Narew River and the Vistula River meet north of Warsaw. From there southward, the Vistula River is the dividing line between the two armies. Since Warsaw is located on the left bank of the Vistula River, it will naturally be assigned to the German side. The San River originates in the Carpathian Mountains and joins the Vistula River near Sandomierz. Since this river is the boundary within Galicia, the Sandomierz triangle, which has become famous in recent years due to the development of Polish military industry, will also be assigned to Germany. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

Berlin: According to the German official news agency, the German and Soviet governments have agreed to use the Pisa River, the Narew River, the Vistula River, and the San River as the boundary for dividing Poland. Therefore, the Soviet border will start from the border area between Poland and East Prussia, 20 miles north of Nowogród, extend westward to Motele, then cross Warsaw, and reach the confluence of the Vistula River and the San River north of Sandomierz, and then follow the San River through Przemyśl and end near the Hungarian border of Chyrow. The Soviet Union will thus occupy the land between the Polish-Romanian border and the Polish-Ruthenian border. Military operations to delineate the border are now proceeding in order. Red Army troops near Lviv are taking over positions from the German army. More than 1,200 foreigners and 278 members of the diplomatic corps who were allowed to leave Warsaw have been sent to Königsberg. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Bern, Switzerland: The semi-official German news agency, Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro, issued news stating that the German and Soviet governments have demarcated the boundary in the Polish territory occupied by both sides. "People here are now commenting that this news shows that Germany has abandoned the boundary stipulated in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk of 1917." In addition, the "Basler Abendzeitung" also carried a dispatch from Berlin stating that the northern Polish city of Vilnius should be assigned to the Soviet Union, and the southern city of Chyrow is also the same. In this way, the Soviet Union not only borders Hungary, but also neighbors the autonomous region of Slovakia. The oil fields south of Lviv are also included in the country, but the country should grant Germany certain concession rights to allow Germany to develop the coal mines. In short, according to the boundary announced by the Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro, the land divided by the Soviet Union is actually much larger than originally expected, which is a great surprise in Berlin. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Moscow: According to qualified sources here, Germany and the Soviet Union have fully agreed on the issue of their respective operational areas in Poland. At the same time, the official gazette of the local radio broadcast stated that the Soviet army has occupied Lviv, the central city of the Polish oil-producing area, and has also occupied Kovel and Hrodno. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Moscow: The General Staff of the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army announced the war report on the 21st as follows: On September 22, the Red Army was engaged in consolidating the occupied positions and continued to wipe out the defeated Polish troops south of Liany, Kobrin, and Luninets in the occupied areas of Western Belarus and Western Ukraine, and occupied the town of Pinsk at 7 pm on the same day. The officer corps in the Lviv and Sanok areas is also being cleared. (TASS dispatch, 22nd)

The Hague: The "Telegraaf" recently received news from Berlin stating that General Voroshilov, the People's Commissar of Defense of the Soviet Union, is scheduled to go to Berlin on the 30th of this month to meet with German military leaders. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Bern, Switzerland: The "Basler Abendzeitung" recently reported, according to private news from the capital of Hungary, after the Soviet army entered Poland, Soviet governments have been established in the southern Polish cities of Turka, Sniatyn, and several other cities. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

Berlin: Today, the German military headquarters announced that the German and Soviet troops invading Poland are proceeding in order according to the agreed demarcation plan between the two countries, without any conflict. The German troops near Lviv have withdrawn and been taken over by the Soviet troops. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

Budapest: The Hungarian troops operating in southern Poland arrived in Rafajlowa this afternoon, which is located at the border between Poland and Hungary. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

### Most of the German Troops Move Westward

Berlin: According to news here today, Germany has begun to transfer a large number of troops to the Western Front because the military operations in Poland have ended. Among them, at least 1.5 million tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and heavy artillery have been transported to the Western Front. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin: According to reports from travelers who arrived here yesterday, after the German high authorities announced that the Polish army had been annihilated (except for Warsaw and Lviv), attention has been shifted to the Western Front. Artillery and aircraft units are being transferred from the Eastern Front to the Western Front. Officials do not admit this, nor do they keep it secret. The German government announced that after the Soviet and German troops met, they withdrew to the locations agreed upon by the two governments. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)

Milan: According to a special correspondent of the "Corriere della Sera" who went to the German army on the Western Front, Germany is now gradually withdrawing troops from Poland to the Western Front. Military transports are frequent and endless every day. The correspondent believes that the Polish war is just the prelude to a real war, and the real war will not break out until next spring. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

### Turkey Still Maintains Friendly Relations with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union; Turkish Foreign Minister to Visit Moscow; Britain and Turkey Seek to Promote Trade Relations

Ankara, Turkey: Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu left for Moscow tonight. Before his departure, he told a Havas reporter, "Your Excellency is well aware that Turkey and the Soviet Union maintain friendly relations. In recent years, important figures from the Soviet government have visited our country many times. I am now determined to visit the Soviet Union to reciprocate and will naturally reaffirm the long-standing friendship. Your Excellency is also aware that our country has good relations with Britain and France. Our Prime Minister Saydam gave a speech on the 11th of this month, earnestly explaining our willingness to maintain good relations with the two major democracies in Western Europe. This policy has not changed." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu is coming to visit and is expected to arrive at the port of Odessa (on the Black Sea coast) on the 22nd of this month. However, due to frequent Soviet military transportation, railway traffic is not regular. It is difficult to determine when Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu will arrive in Moscow. Foreign observers here stated that the Soviet army is conducting major operations in the west, but there is no mobilization in the northern area near the Latvian border. The rumor that the Soviet government has issued a warning to Latvia has not been confirmed. Also, since Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty, many Germans have been seen here. About 30 German experts have arrived here to help the Soviet Union improve its oil industry and increase the amount of oil shipped to Germany. According to unconfirmed news, former German Minister of Economy Hjalmar Schacht is also here, but Soviet production is only sufficient for its own use. Therefore, some people doubt whether Germany and the Soviet Union can cooperate economically. Foreign observers said that in previous years of poor harvests, the Soviet Union was still able to export various industrial products abroad, which shows that the extent to which the Soviet Union provides economic assistance to Germany does not depend on economic possibilities, but on political concepts. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

London: Overseas Trade Minister Hudson recently declared in the House of Commons that a Turkish delegation is now in London, consulting with the British government on how to facilitate the country's sale of various agricultural products and other goods to Britain. Before the two sides reach an agreement, the government has taken certain temporary measures to facilitate trade relations between the two countries. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Warsaw: The local radio station recently broadcast news stating that the enemy has repeatedly attacked the city, but all have been repelled by the defenders, and seven enemy aircraft have been shot down. The city hospital has a Red Cross flag, which is very obvious, but it was also bombed by enemy aircraft today. At the same time, the Soviet embassy and many monuments were also bombed. Our army's positions in the suburbs of Wola and Mokotów remain unshaken. The battle situation in Praga and Bródno is extremely fierce. Although the German army used motorized units to attack, they were all repelled by our cavalry units. According to Colonel Liszewski, the chief of staff of the defense command, our soldiers are exceptionally brave and jump into the enemy's armored vehicles to capture enemy soldiers. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Warsaw: According to Warsaw Radio, three Polish cavalry brigades broke through the German lines yesterday to reinforce the Warsaw defenders. The German army continues to attack Warsaw with aircraft and heavy artillery. The German army launched several attacks west of the city, but all were repelled. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)

Paris: According to German sources, eight French aircraft and three reconnaissance balloons were shot down by German aircraft yesterday. Responsible military figures here firmly deny this. Since the beginning of the war, our country's aircraft have been continuously engaged in reconnaissance on the German front and in the rear, and have achieved great success. They are paying close attention to various highways and railway lines in western Germany in order to detect the enemy's troop movements. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Brussels: The semi-official Belgian news agency published a responsible statement stating that the rumor that the German army is gathering on the lines on the German-Belgian border is unfounded. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Geneva: A military expert from the "Tribune de Genève" reviewed the war situation after the collapse of Poland and concluded that there would be no large-scale battles on the German Western Front except for possibly larger-scale activities by the air force. He firmly believes that there will be no major war on the Saar River and other parts of the two major defense lines. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

Brussels: A special correspondent from Brussels dispatched to the German Western Front reported that British troops have arrived outside the German western fortifications, but they are watching and hesitating and are not active. French military and civilians are commenting on the British army's attitude, believing that unless the Allied Supreme Commander has decided to use the British army as a "reserve force," what are the British troops waiting for since they have already arrived? (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

### Hitler Inspects the Front Lines

Danzig: Führer Hitler inspected the Westerplatte port near Danzig today. There was fierce fighting there at the beginning of the war. After Hitler finished his inspection, he took the training ship "Holstein" to the port of Gdynia, which has been renamed "Gotenhafen," and met with General Göring there. (Haitong dispatch, 21st)

### Order Gradually Restored in Red Army Occupied Areas

Moscow: After Western Belarus and Western Ukraine were liberated by the Red Army from the shackles of Poland, life in their cities and villages is gradually returning to normal. Shops in the towns have begun to reopen, and postal and telecommunications agencies, power plants, and industrial factories are also gradually resuming work. Telephone lines have been connected from the occupied areas to Soviet Belarus and Ukraine. The local people are actively assisting in restoring normal life, sending representatives to organize temporary administrative organs in towns and electing village peasant committees. Workers' self-defense forces have been organized in various cities and towns to maintain order, and their temporary administrative organs are trying to restore normal life. For example, the temporary government of Stobtsy, Western Belarus, has announced that both Soviet and Polish currencies can be used. The temporary government of Chortkiv, Western Ukraine, has begun to repair the bridges destroyed by the Poles and restore work in various factories. In both cities and villages, Soviet flags and portraits of Stalin are hanging high on all civilian houses. (TASS dispatch, 22nd)

Editorial

### Future Trends of the Soviet Union

The Soviet Union marched into Poland, occupying Hrodno on the Northern Belarusian front, occupying Kovel and Lviv on the Southern Western Ukrainian front, as well as Vilnius, formerly belonging to Lithuania but occupied by Poland. According to recent news, the city of Brest-Litovsk, where the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which was signed separately by the Soviet Union and Germany in 1918, was established—the place where the Soviet Union lost half of its territory in Europe due to this treaty—is also assigned to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union recovered all the land it lost in the previous World War without firing a shot. Is the Soviet Union already complacent? After joining forces with Germany in Poland, what will its attitude be in the future? How will the Soviet Union explain that such a disposition does not violate its peace policy? These are issues worthy of discussion at present.

Germany and the Soviet Union joining forces in Poland, the most affected is of course Poland, and Poland suffered such a tragic situation. Her past diplomacy also inevitably planted the seeds of evil. Poland's situation is between two great powers. Considering that the previous alliance of Prussia, Russia, and Austria led to the division of Poland, in recent years, her diplomacy, as British female journalist Walensky said a few years ago, was to try to ally with Germany and Russia on one hand, while trying to maintain a considerable distance from both sides, but not adopting a very close attitude towards any party. In the past, Poland had a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, and also had a ten-year non-aggression treaty with Germany. She thought that she could be at ease by playing both sides. Unexpectedly, Hitler announced the abolition of the ten-year German-Polish non-aggression treaty with a thunderbolt, and then the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty was announced. Before Germany even launched an attack, Poland's situation was already precarious. By the time Hitler used the Danzig issue as an excuse to start a war against Poland, the only countries Poland could rely on were Britain and France, which were very far away. Although Britain and France declared their obligation to provide military assistance in advance, they could not send large troops to participate in the war due to their geographical disconnection with Poland. They could only station troops on the western border of Germany to threaten and provide remote support. Germany's army and air force have always been known to be strong, and now they are using the power of thunder to attack Poland, and it is easy to win. Poland found it very difficult to resist the German army with the strength of the whole country, let alone with the oppression of the Soviet Union and attacks from both east and west. Then the collapse of Poland is self-evident.

Since the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with militarist Germany in March 1918, the land it lost was almost equal to the total territory of Austria-Hungary and Turkey. The population lost reached 56 million, accounting for 32% of its total population; and it lost one-third of its total railway mileage, 73% of its total iron production, and 89% of its total coal production. In addition, it lost 5,000 factories. The Soviet Union is now occupying eastern Poland, although it claims to have liberated "Belarusians and Ukrainians from the shackles of Polish squires," we do not know whether its motive is to completely recover the land lost after the previous World War. However, the Soviet Union has stated that its measures do not violate its peace policy, so it maintains neutrality towards Romania at present and does not want to reclaim Bessarabia, which formerly belonged to Russia. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also announced that "the governments of all countries that have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union continue to maintain a neutral policy." From this, it can be known that the Soviet Union still intends to maintain normal relations with other new countries that split from the old Russia, such as Estonia and Latvia, and will not apply what it has done to Poland today to these countries. This time, the Soviet Union invaded Poland, even if it has the meaning of recovering lost territory, I am afraid that it will temporarily limit itself to eastern Poland, and wait for an opportunity to observe the situation and determine its future actions. The meaning of the Soviet Union's so-called non-violation of its peace policy probably refers to these.

As for the future relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, this is not difficult to speculate. The British Daily Herald believes that "the cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union is not very good, and there is a great possibility of friction. Although there have been no major disputes so far, the signs of future disputes and permanent suspicion have already appeared. It is not certain that it will become sharp before the end of the war." This is a bit premature. Since Britain and France have declared their commitment to help Poland to the end, Germany cannot stop the war with Britain and France and must continue it. Then Hitler must rely heavily on the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has deployed heavy troops in the eastern border of Poland. It can attack when advancing and defend when retreating. It is obvious that it cannot be bullied in terms of military situation. It is said that Germany and the Soviet Union have established a temporary agreement on the demarcation of the border within Poland, so there should be no major changes in the short term. Under such circumstances, if Hitler transfers the troops from the Eastern Front to the Western Front, the Soviet Union can afford to sit back and watch the success or failure, and wait for the development of the war in Western Europe. Since the Soviet Union has no constraints in the West, then it will naturally have no scruples in East Asia. Why should it change its diplomatic policy? Recently, rumors of a five-nation alliance have been rampant. We only need to guess about the superior position currently occupied by the Soviet Union to know that it is an unfounded propaganda with other effects, and we do not need to pay attention to it.

### Former Prime Minister Dies for His Country; New Romanian Cabinet Established; Resolution to Nullify Activities of the Iron Guard; Continues to Maintain Neutrality Towards the European War

Following the assassination of Romanian Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense and Interior, Calinescu, King Carol II appointed General Argeșanu as Prime Minister, General Marinescu as Minister of Interior and Mayor of the capital, and General Ilcuș as Minister of National Defense. The newly appointed cabinet members were sworn into office by the King at 9:30 PM this evening. The new cabinet then held its first cabinet meeting at 10:30 PM. The assassins have been executed by firing squad in public. Prime Minister Argeșanu attended the execution after the cabinet meeting. The bodies of the assassins will be displayed at the execution ground for 24 hours. According to responsible sources, the authorities' investigation proved that the case had no political significance. The assassins confessed that the late Prime Minister Calinescu severely punished members of the Iron Guard, and the purpose of the assassination was solely for revenge. Political figures also stated that the late Prime Minister Calinescu strictly adhered to neutrality in Romania regarding the ongoing European war, therefore, the case has no international implications. According to diplomatic circles, the late Prime Minister Calinescu spared no effort in suppressing the activities of the Iron Guard. Unexpectedly, he died for his country just as the group had disappeared from view. His greatest task during his lifetime was to maintain public order. He was particularly brave and determined when confronting members of the Iron Guard and their late leader, Codreanu. He had narrowly escaped several assassination attempts during his lifetime. In the spring of this year, when the King visited London, Codreanu and ten of his followers were shot and killed by military police for attempting to escape. At that time, the late Prime Minister Calinescu received more threatening letters than ever before, but he remained calm. In summary, if Calinescu had not suppressed the Iron Guard, it would have caused great turmoil in the country. Therefore, Romania's calm situation during the outbreak of the European war was due to his efforts. However, it was expected that the group, originally representing the German minority, would take the opportunity to rise up and attempt to disrupt Romania's order in recent weeks. Their primary target was to assassinate Calinescu, demonstrating their deep-seated hatred for him. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

Detailed Account of Calinescu's Assassination: Struck by Eleven Bullets, Dies Instantly; Six Assassins Arrested on the Spot

Bucharest: Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Calinescu was assassinated by eight young members of the fascist Iron Guard at 1:45 PM today while returning to his residence by car. The assassination took place at the foot of the Dâmbovița Bridge. The assassins planned meticulously, placing three cars and one horse-drawn carriage beside the bridge in advance. As soon as the Prime Minister's car approached, one of the cars deliberately collided with it, and the horse-drawn carriage was placed across the road to block traffic. The assassins then rushed out of the remaining two cars and fired multiple shots. Prime Minister Calinescu was struck by eleven bullets and died instantly. A bodyguard was also killed on the spot, and the driver was seriously injured. At the same time, bomb attacks occurred in two other locations in the capital, but the public remained calm and there was no unrest. Upon hearing the news, King Carol II immediately convened a meeting of the cabinet to discuss the political situation, which lasted until 6:00 PM. Military and police authorities immediately took various measures to ensure safety throughout the country, and strictly guarded against the Iron Guard and certain restless ethnic minorities. Telephone services were suspended throughout the country for 20 minutes, and transportation between Romania and other countries was also interrupted. At the time of the assassination, pedestrians on nearby streets scattered and fled, allowing the assassins to escape into the crowd. They then went to a radio station, injured a staff member, and broke into the broadcasting studio to announce the assassination of Prime Minister Calinescu. Shortly after, the police arrived and arrested them. Except for two assassins who were killed, the remaining six were arrested. All were medical students and claimed to be former members of the "Death Squad." They stated that there was no mastermind behind the incident. However, their leader was reportedly Dumitrescu, a lawyer who had just returned to Romania from Carpathian Ruthenia in Hungary six weeks ago and was also arrested after the incident. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

Bucharest: Following the assassination of Romanian Prime Minister Calinescu last night as he returned to his residence by car, a state of emergency has been declared throughout Romania. It is reported that the assassins were members of the banned fascist Iron Guard. Military and police are conducting searches throughout the country for suspects. Bucharest is calm under the guard of thousands of soldiers with bayonets fixed, but the situation in the provinces is unknown. Calinescu had no chance to defend himself when he was assassinated because his car was blocked by a car deliberately placed in the road. Another car then drove up from behind, blocking his retreat. Shortly after, two more cars arrived on either side, and a group of young men with pistols jumped out and opened fire. The Prime Minister was hit by eleven bullets, two of which entered his heart and one piercing his mouth. A police officer accompanying him immediately jumped out but was shot fourteen times and fell to the ground. The driver was also seriously injured. After the assassination, the assassins drove to the Bucharest radio station, shot and injured a staff member, and seized the microphone to announce the assassination. The young men shouted into the microphone, "The blood debt of Codreanu (leader of the Romanian Iron Guard) has been repaid!" Another yelled, "The time for revenge has come!" The dissolution of the Iron Guard was carried out by Calinescu when he was Minister of Interior last year. Ten minutes later, the assailants were outnumbered and escaped. The radio announcer then broadcast that the program was temporarily interrupted due to an "unfortunate incident" and would resume today. Immediately after the incident, all traffic in Bucharest was cut off, and the military and police were immediately dispatched. King Carol convened an emergency cabinet meeting that lasted until late at night and ordered the troops to remain in their camps and strengthened border and garrison forces everywhere. Although an official statement claimed that no foreign involvement was found in the assassination of the Prime Minister, Romanians are very concerned about the border. According to what the assassins said in the broadcast, Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard, was arrested in April 1938 for treason. He was killed by prison guards in November of that year. The official statement at the time said he was shot while attempting to escape. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Political Assassination Case: Cause and Effect; Similar to the Dollfuss Case in Every Respect

Paris: Political figures here recently stated that as Soviet troops have reached the Romanian border, Germany is trying to exert internal pressure on Romania. Romanian Prime Minister Calinescu and the late Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss both died at the hands of National Socialists. It is common knowledge that the Romanian Iron Guard maintains connections with the German Nazi Party. Former Romanian Prime Minister Duca was assassinated in December 1933 for dissolving the Iron Guard. Subsequently, King Carol II of that country refused to succumb to German pressure and consistently relied on Calinescu to suppress the Iron Guard. The fundamental reason for this assassination lies in this. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

London: People here are commenting on the assassination of Romanian Prime Minister Calinescu, saying that the case was caused by German propaganda, similar to the assassination of the late Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss. Calinescu and King Carol II of Romania both advocated maintaining the territorial integrity of their country and maintaining the most friendly relations with the democratic countries of Western Europe. Some people therefore deliberately removed them. However, this action not only fails to achieve the desired effect, but also makes the Romanian people more deeply disgusted and resentful of National Socialist groups. In addition, some well-informed sources claim that after Polish government officials recently took refuge in Romania, the Romanian government treated them coldly. The assassination of Calinescu is Germany's response to this matter. There was intelligence here two days ago that the Iron Guard was trying to cause trouble, but no one could have expected that the group would dare to use the methods of the Nazi Party and resort to assassination. (Havas News Agency, 11th)

Berlin: According to well-informed sources in Bucharest, the late Romanian Prime Minister Calinescu, who was assassinated yesterday, had been exchanging views with the British and Polish ambassadors for days, and the discussions were very intense. It is said that weeks ago, the Polish government was prepared to move the government to Romania in case of emergency, so that it could continue to operate. Therefore, the Polish government secretly transferred all its reserves to Romania. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Romania, the former Romanian Prime Minister insisted that they should respect Romanian neutrality and be treated as private individuals in Romania and not engage in any political activities. As a result, the Polish ambassador had a dispute with Calinescu, and the British ambassador encouraged him from the sidelines. At the same time, the British government wanted to implement its promise of guarantee to Poland and planned to send troops to land in Constanța, but this was sternly rejected by Calinescu, who insisted that the British request was completely inconsistent with Romanian neutrality. He declared that Romania could not accept this request after Soviet troops entered Poland to avoid creating a new situation. At the time, Calinescu and the British ambassador argued strongly, and both sides were very emotional. Therefore, many believe that the report that Calinescu was assassinated by the "Iron Guard" may be a smokescreen, and the real murderers must have foreign support. After the execution of the assassins last night, a rumor spread throughout Bucharest that "the British and Polish assassinated the Romanian Prime Minister." Many people are talking about this, which deserves attention. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

### US Special Session of Congress Opens; Reconsiders Neutrality Law; Roosevelt Asks for Repeal of Arms Embargo; Proposes Four Conditions for Wartime Trade

Washington: The special session of Congress specially convened by President Roosevelt to consider the neutrality proposals began today as one of the most important meetings in the history of Congress. When President Roosevelt entered the hall, the entire audience cheered in unison. The President then delivered the opening remarks, stating: "I have convened this meeting to consider and address certain amendments to the law. In my opinion, this law has changed the United States' foreign policy in its history, endangering America's peaceful relations with foreign countries. The United States has made every effort to prevent the occurrence of war. If war breaks out, then the United States should, to the extent of its power, keep the United States out of the war. In my view, this can definitely be successful. Last year and in January of this year, I said that the United States' neutrality measures would benefit the aggressor nations. Our self-defense should warn us not to allow this situation to continue to exist. During the Napoleonic Wars, the United States made changes to its neutrality law, and in 1935 it did so again. I regret that Congress passed this bill, and I also regret that I approved this bill. I now ask Congress to amend the part of the Neutrality Act that completely contradicts the country's old articles and laws, namely, the arms embargo. In my opinion, this provision is very harmful to the neutrality and security of the United States, and it is harmful to peace. I advocate that American citizens and ships should leave places where there is a real and immediate danger of conflict. What I advocate is to restore the nation to a solid foundation of true traditional power. I believe that American ships should be restricted from entering war zones. The government's proposal is better than any other method to keep the United States out of the war. My objectives are as follows: (1) Restrict American ships from entering war zones; (2) Prevent Americans from traveling on belligerent ships or traveling in dangerous areas; (3) Foreign merchants must transfer ownership of goods purchased from belligerents in the United States; (4) Prevent wartime credit loans to belligerents. The last two objectives will result in all procurements being made on a cash-and-carry basis and goods being shipped by the purchaser's own ships and at the purchaser's own risk. There are two other objectives that have already been achieved by existing laws, namely, the management of belligerent fundraising in the United States and the maintenance of the licensing system for the import and export of arms, ammunition, and military supplies. This procedure can reduce the possibility of accidents and disputes, which can draw us into conflict, as evidenced by those that unfortunately occurred before the war. This is the only way to peace." (Reuters, 21st)

Washington: President Roosevelt convened a special session of Congress yesterday to discuss repealing the arms embargo clause of the Neutrality Act and returning to trade with belligerents based on the principles of international law. The President proposed the following four steps to enable the United States to maintain neutrality and maintain peace: (1) Authorize the President to designate war zones to prohibit American merchants from entering them; (2) Grant the President broad powers to prevent American people from traveling on belligerent ships or traveling in dangerous areas; (3) Stipulate that when belligerents purchase necessities from the United States, they must do so in the name of the purchaser before export; (4) Prohibit the granting of credit loans to belligerent countries. President Roosevelt declared, "After the last two articles are implemented, all purchases must be made on a cash basis, and the purchased goods must be transported by the purchaser's own ships at their own risk." After the government's proposed Neutrality Act procedures are enacted, Congress will adjourn. Once the situation in Europe necessitates convening Congress, a special session will be convened immediately. The President requested Congress to work together across party lines and with the government. "In the current dangerous situation, the government requests cooperation from all parties to keep the United States from being drawn into the whirlpool of war. Although the United States did not participate in causing the war in Europe, "we have been affected by the war. Our business is changing, our minds are full of new problems, and our position in the world has changed." The President summarized the steps taken during a national emergency. He said that at present, in addition to the four steps, there is no need to ask Congress for more power. The President asked all parties not to promote peace groups and oppose the repeal of the arms embargo clause of the Neutrality Act. "We all belong to that group. I firmly believe that after the arms embargo is repealed, the United States will be more likely to maintain peace than it is today when the clause has not been repealed." The Senate and House of Representatives convened separately at noon yesterday, and seventeen isolationists met in Senator Johnson's office before the meeting to discuss strategies for dealing with President Roosevelt's proposals. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, took a radical stance at the opening of the meeting and refused to print Colonel Lindbergh's recent radio address. Pittman said that the event had no political significance, but it had to be done after President Roosevelt's speech was delivered. Senator Schwellenbach, a Washington Democrat, said that there would be a fierce debate over the ban on arms shipments to Japan. However, according to the Associated Press reporter, the issue was not discussed at the White House meeting yesterday when the Neutrality Act was discussed. After Congress opened at noon, this historic Senate debate began. The administration clearly has the upper hand over the isolationists. President Roosevelt's speech has changed the attitude of the opposition. After meeting in Senator Johnson's office before the meeting, Wisconsin Senator La Follette stated that they were prepared to insist on opposing President Roosevelt's proposals. The office of Senator Johnson, where the isolationists met, was the same place where the isolationists met twenty years ago to discuss opposing the United States joining the League of Nations. Johnson told reporters that although the isolationists would do their best to oppose the President's proposals, they would not disrupt the process in Congress. Senator Pittman, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the committee would complete its review of the President's proposals within three days. The committee will meet tomorrow, but the isolationists believe that Pittman's statement is "too optimistic." Congress will adjourn on Monday. (Reuters, 22nd)

New York: The American Institute of Public Opinion recently announced that President Roosevelt's prestige has significantly increased since the outbreak of the European war. Before March, only 56.6% of Americans supported the President's policies, but by now it has increased to 62.5%. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

Washington: Democratic Congressman Gannatt intends to introduce a motion to the House of Representatives to have President Roosevelt convene a conference of neutral European countries. It is reported that the main task of the conference is to consider inviting belligerents to join the conference to jointly plan a permanent peace. (Associated Press, 22nd)

Washington: Republican Congressman Crawford told the Associated Press yesterday that the balance of power in the world has changed and the European war is bound to be prolonged, so the United States needs to re-examine the issue of Philippine independence. Crawford said: "If other European countries unite with Germany, Russia, and Japan to attack Western European countries, then what will the Philippines rely on? I think the first step the Japanese will take is to deal with the Philippine Islands, so it is necessary for the administrative power of the Philippines to be temporarily transferred to the US military government." (Associated Press, 22nd)

Tokyo: According to well-informed sources in Japan, when the United States adopts the new Neutrality Act based on the cash-and-carry terms, the two major island nations of Britain and Japan will benefit the most. However, the United States may apply moral pressure after the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty in January next year, or even impose an arms embargo on Japan. Otherwise, the United States will have no possibility of assisting the Chongqing regime. If the United States takes this step, it will be tantamount to acting as the watchdog of East Asia, and relations between the United States and Japan will likely deteriorate. In short, Japan must prepare to cope with any situation that may arise. (Reuters, 22nd)

### First Experimental Radio Photo Transmission Between Japan and the United States

Tokyo: It is reported here that the first day of experimental radio photo transmission business between the Japanese Ministry of Communications and the Radio Corporation of America was satisfactory. Another experiment will be held tomorrow, and it is hoped that photos of dramatic battles will be regularly transmitted across the Pacific to Japan from September 26. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Soviet Union Releases Japanese Fishing Boats One After Another; Negotiations to Adjust Relations Between the Two Countries to Begin Soon

Tokyo: According to news received here today, eight Japanese motor fishing boats detained by the Soviet authorities will be released in batches on September 30, October 10, and October 20. In addition, two other Japanese fishing boats have been released by the Soviet Union and have been towed to northeastern Korea by Japanese ships today. Twenty Japanese and Korean fishermen detained by the Soviet Union in 1938 and 1939 have also been released and arrived in a certain area of Korea today. The new Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Smetanin, is scheduled to arrive in Japan a month early to take office. He is scheduled to depart from Moscow on October 10. It is reported that the ambassador will negotiate with the Japanese government on adjusting relations between the two countries. At the same time, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov are also conducting similar negotiations in Moscow. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Commercial Relations Between Japan and the United States

Tokyo: A foreign reporter asked the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman today whether Japan had made any proposals to the United States to conclude a new commercial treaty. The spokesman replied that it had not. He also said that the Japanese government would not take any hasty action on this important issue. "Huge trade" between the United States and Japan did not begin because the two countries concluded a commercial treaty. In fact, there was huge trade first, and then the commercial treaty was concluded. The United States' unilateral abolition of the 1911 treaty will not extinguish the existence of current commercial relations between the two countries. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Nomura's Appointment as Japanese Foreign Minister Not Yet Decided

Tokyo: The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman answered questions from reporters today, saying that the rumor that retired Admiral Nomura, the principal of the Gakushuin School, had been selected as foreign minister was still just a rumor. Nomura is not only familiar with American affairs, but also with European affairs, and is well qualified to serve as foreign minister, but Prime Minister Abe has not contacted him. No one can say now whether he will ask Nomura to serve as foreign minister. (Reuters, 20th)

Tokyo: Admiral Nomura, the principal of the Gakushuin School, who the newspaper believes will be appointed foreign minister, visited Imperial Household Minister Matsudaira Tsuneo this morning. It is reported that they discussed the matter of a successor to the principal of the Gakushuin School. At the same time, according to the Asahi Shimbun, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abe originally intended to choose the foreign minister at his leisure, but the outbreak of the European war and the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement made it impossible for the Prime Minister to choose a suitable person from among the Japanese diplomats currently serving in Europe. Therefore, after careful consideration, he set his sights on Admiral Nomura. It is expected that Nomura will take office early next week. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Czech Rebellion Gradually Subsiding; Revolution Not Yet Ripe

London: According to news from Czech sources here today, the Czech rebellion is gradually being suppressed. The battles in Prague have already ceased. Because there are 120,000 German troops in the Czech region, and an additional 15,000 German secret service personnel, the German side is still able to control the overall situation. However, if German power weakens even slightly, then a Czech revolution will certainly erupt again. (September 22nd, Associated Press)

London: People here are currently discussing the impact of the Czech revolution. The general consensus is that it is not yet ripe. However, it is believed that because the Germans arrested many Czech leaders, the Czech people had no choice but to revolt immediately. The people are extremely indignant. Even if the German side carries out much slaughter, it will not be able to extinguish the revolutionary spirit of the Czechs. Many guerrilla groups have now been discovered within Poland, and there is also activity of this kind within the Czech region. According to the opinion of military critics, if the Polish and Czech guerrilla groups take joint action, then this will force Germany to station at least 400,000 troops in the eastern region. The advance of Soviet troops in southern Poland is also a point of widespread attention. The areas where the Soviet troops are advancing include, on one side, Kolomyia on the Romanian border, and on the other, Boryslav, which is the focus of German ambition. What is also noteworthy is that German bombers are not bombing the Lviv and Sniatyn railway that leads into Romania, and want to preserve the route for transporting Romanian oil and wheat. However, the route into Romania is now clearly blocked by the advance of Soviet troops. It is expected that after the fall of Warsaw, Hitler will issue a kind of hypocritical peace proposal, not truly hoping that Britain and France will accept it, but wanting to show his own people and neutral countries that he hopes for peace. (September 22nd, Reuters)

Geneva: The Geneva Post recently reported that according to news from the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, which are under German protectorate, the German government had long anticipated the rebellions that have recently occurred there. Therefore, at the beginning of this month, it arrested many prominent figures and important figures in the church as hostages. "It is also heard that when German troops advanced into Poland on the first of this month, the German government immediately adopted severe measures in the western provinces of Bohemia and Moravia to deal with the majority Czech population. The country's political police also arrested political leaders in many cities, as well as senior officials of the two provinces' autonomous governments and leaders of various cultural and sports organizations (such as the Sokol Society and the Orel Society), in large numbers. Important church figures such as Archbishop Martinů of Olomouc (age 50, recently recovered from pneumonia), Abbot Vlastimil Vaněk of St. Anne's College, Bishop Šimečka, vice president of the Catholic Progressive Association, and many other clergy have been successively arrested. When these clergy were arrested, they were not allowed to carry any of their belongings, and even their Bibles were confiscated. Although various parties made great efforts to rescue them, they have not yet been released." (September 22nd, Havas)

### Japanese Newspapers Comment on the European Situation

Tokyo: The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that the German army's occupation of most of Poland has dealt a major blow to Britain and France, but it is not enough to shake their fighting spirit. Although Poland has suffered temporary changes, Britain and France have not encountered any major damage, unlike Germany, which has suffered many losses. It seems that the Soviet Union and Italy do not have a tendency to advance and retreat with Germany, while Britain and France are increasingly determined to fight Germany. It is believed that Germany will eventually experience internal turmoil due to the exhaustion of its energy. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that German-Soviet cooperation, for the time being, is limited to the partition of Poland. However, whether this cooperation can last is another question.

### British Government Publishes Pre-War British-German Documents; Hitler Once Proposed an Alliance with Britain; Britain Cannot Deny Responsibility for German-Soviet Compromise

London: The British government has now published a White Paper, containing pre-war British-German documents, such as Germany's reply of September 3rd rejecting Britain's ultimatum, which led Britain to declare war, and the details of the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, meeting with Hitler, and the arguments between German Air Minister Göring and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The German reply stated, "The German government and people refuse to accept the demands of the nature of an ultimatum put forward by the British government. We will respond to any aggression from the British side with the same weapons and the same methods." On September 3rd, at 11:20 a.m., twenty minutes after the deadline of the British ultimatum expired, Germany sent a memorandum to Henderson, stating, "The British government has rejected Mussolini's proposal to salvage peace, therefore, the British government will be responsible for all the misfortunes and tragedies that many people have suffered and will suffer." The White Paper contains many noteworthy events, one of which is Hitler's conversation with Henderson on August 28th. Hitler asked whether Britain was willing to form an alliance with Germany. Prior to this, Hitler had told the British Ambassador that it was Britain that had forced him to compromise with the Soviet Union. Henderson cabled Halifax, "Hitler does not seem enthusiastic about this compromise, but if there is a compromise, it should be quite long-lasting." The British Ambassador criticized the Soviet-German treaty to the Foreign Secretary, expressing his opinion, "If it is only a non-aggression pact, and there are no supplements afterwards, then I will consider it strange." When Henderson and Göring discussed the outcome of the British-German war, Göring said that Germany's history was one of rising and falling, and this time it would be a "rise." The British Ambassador reported on his meeting with the German Foreign Minister on August 30th, saying, "In this unpleasant meeting, Ribbentrop's entire attitude was to imitate Hitler as much as possible." Henderson reported to Halifax on his meeting with Göring in May, in which he warned Göring of the consequences of Hitler listening to the plans of "extremists." Göring immediately changed the subject, and said that he had not rested in Sanremo for long, but because of the unexpected increase in work, he had ended his vacation. He then said that there was no country in Europe that could defeat Germany, and that a blockade would be futile. Göring used every conceivable word to respond to the idea that Germany was bound to fail. Göring's words were so exaggerated that the impression of trust gained by the listener was far less than what he expressed. The British Ambassador told him that "if you want to avoid war, you must be patient, and the German extremists must be restrained." When the German Ambassador to Britain expressed his displeasure at the fact that Germany was being surrounded, Halifax cabled Henderson, "I replied that if anyone is surrounding Germany, then that person is Germany itself, because Germany is surrounding itself with the policies it insists on adopting. The German leader has broken the chain in Europe. It is clear that Hitler is the one who can undo it." The White Paper details Henderson's meeting with Hitler on August 23rd as follows: The British Ambassador told the German leader, "As far as I know, we have never broken our word in centuries. We cannot break our word now and still be British." Hitler was furious and unyielding, using harsh words to describe Britain and Poland, but in the re-meeting, Hitler was quite calm, but still clearly stated his determination to attack Poland if another German in Poland was abused. Henderson then spoke of the tragedy of war and Hitler's great responsibility. The German leader replied that it was all Britain's fault. The British Ambassador refuted this. Hitler then said that Britain was determined to destroy and annihilate Germany, and that he was fifty years old and would rather fight now than at the age of fifty-five or sixty. Henderson said that the idea of annihilating Germany was ridiculous, and that a peaceful and prosperous Germany was actually beneficial to Britain. The German leader replied that Britain was fighting for fewer ethnic groups, while he was only fighting for Germany. Germany was determined to fight to the last man. If he had been the leader in 1914, the situation that year would have been different. When the British Ambassador met with the German leader on August 28th, Hitler repeatedly mentioned the Polish issue. Henderson told him that he had to choose between gaining British friendship and making excessive demands on Poland. Hitler said that he had to satisfy the demands of his people, and that his army was ready and eager for war. The people were united, and he could not continue to allow Poland to abuse Germans. Ribbentrop asked Henderson whether he could guarantee that Chamberlain could lead the country to implement a policy of friendship towards Germany. The British Ambassador said that if Germany cooperated, Chamberlain would undoubtedly be able to implement this policy. Hitler asked whether Britain would accept an alliance with Germany. Henderson, in his personal capacity, said that if the development of events justified a British-German alliance, then he would not reject this possibility. The German leader insisted that he was not making empty promises. The British Ambassador replied that he knew the facts well, and that neither Britain nor Germany was making empty promises. Hitler said that he fully understood this point, and suggested that Britain should immediately make some offers regarding the colonial issue. Henderson replied that concessions were easier to achieve in a good atmosphere than in a bad atmosphere. In their re-meeting on August 29th, Hitler insisted that he wanted Britain's friendship more than anything else in the world, but that he could not sacrifice Germany's vital interests for Britain's friendship.

### Broadcast Address by the French Prime Minister to the Nation; Encouragement to Fight for Justice

Paris: Prime Minister Daladier gave a radio broadcast tonight, issuing a message to the nation, stating, "We have been at war for twenty days. I have wanted to directly inform the nation about the military and diplomatic situation every day, but I have only been able to do so tonight. I am not speaking now as a leader of fanaticism and the masses, because I am responsible for leading a free, peaceful, and humanitarian nation. Although my responsibilities are very heavy, I am still an ordinary person. I inspected the front lines a few days ago, and went to the positions where our troops had entered German territory by several kilometers. I know very well that our officers at all levels have gained experience in the First European War, and they are fighting steadily and surely. All offensives that are unintentional and very costly can be avoided. I have also personally seen that our soldiers are both extremely calm and courageous, and they all understand what they are fighting for. In essence, they all know that this war was forced upon us by Germany, which has been ambitious and boundless in the past three years, repeatedly using threats and creating alarms, causing our country to mobilize national forces three times in one year, causing economic life to stagnate, families to be separated, and European countries to have no day of peace. Therefore, we are urging everyone to be vigilant, so that our country will not be overthrown by a terrifying regime that has lost its morality. We have already tasted the flavor of this kind of regime in countries that have been ravaged by National Socialism. National Socialism's terrifying regime has been raging in Germany for several years. Later, Austria and the Czech Republic were ravaged, and Poland has now failed to escape, which is regrettable. We have made many efforts to save peace. The highest authorities in Britain and the United States, as well as the Italian government, have also repeatedly attempted to do so, but they have all failed. The reason for this is that Germany deliberately destroyed Poland. Moreover, Germany ostensibly conducted negotiations with other countries, but secretly prepared for war and negotiated secret treaties. Once the opportunity arrived and the henchmen were colluding, the storm fell upon Poland. The respectable country of Poland fought bravely, which is a model for us. However, because mobilization had not yet begun when a strong enemy was pressing down on the border, and the German army's weapons were sharper and its numbers were greater, initial setbacks were inevitable. However, the Polish army still firmly defended its territory, shortened the line of defense, and fought a desperate battle with the enemy. How could it be expected that when the Polish army was stopping the advance of German motorized units near the cities of Kutno and Lviv, and the isolated army of Warsaw was stubbornly defending itself, the Soviet army would enter Poland in accordance with the secret agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union? Germany and the Soviet Union signed an agreement on the 23rd of last month, agreeing on a method of partitioning Poland. Before this, Hitler pretended that what he demanded was only (1) the return of Danzig, (2) a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor, and (3) the construction of a highway through the Corridor. Even after the Soviet-German agreement was concluded and Poland's fate had already been decided, he still spoke of this. How can honest people believe these people who are now covered in blood and talking boastfully about peace? In recent years, various treaties have been destroyed and various agreements have been torn up. How can we expect the French people to believe the promises of this day? There are countless instances of this kind of destruction of treaties. The most important ones are the Locarno Treaty, the independence of Austria, the independence of the Sudetenland, and the territorial integrity of Poland. Therefore, Hitler now declares that once Poland is destroyed, he will have no further demands, that he does not need anything from France, and that he is willing to respect its borders. But if he could destroy France, as he destroyed Austria and the Czech Republic in the past, he would do so now if he were to attempt to destroy Poland. This is what the French people understand. Hitler wrote in his book "Mein Kampf" that "France must be isolated and destroyed." Germany is therefore conducting divisive movements within France, trying to incite autonomy in the provinces of Brittany and Alsace-Lorraine, and planning to buy off traitors to work for it. This is the same as its means of dealing with Austria and the Czech Republic. The French people will never fall into his trap, and have already risen up in unison to resist. Germany has therefore changed its propaganda strategy, trying to sow discord between Britain and France. For example, the enemy has no money to broadcast on the radio, and vigorously argues that French soldiers are not fighting for their own country, but for Britain. But the deep friendship between Britain and France is what the French people know. They now see the British Navy searching for German submarines, British planes fighting in the skies over France, and British soldiers also cooperating with them on the French border to kill the enemy. In a word, the people of Britain and France have the same feelings about the ideals of freedom and human dignity, so Germany's propaganda is only a waste of time. Even if Goebbels or his successor can instigate German women to pretend to be French mothers and broadcast anti-war messages, it is enough to shame the true mothers of France. Even if there are one or two traitors in France who pretend to mourn the fate of the soldiers of their country, they are only despised by the people and will instead strengthen the hatred of the enemy. In short, German propaganda may be able to turn right and wrong upside down, but the people are patriotic and will never be deceived. Our country has always relied on patriotism to be saved when it was in a critical moment of life and death. Now we are fighting, just because we do not want our country to be in a state of slavery, so we must go all out. The people of the whole country must participate in unison, and we will never allow a few people to get rich while the majority shed blood. This decision, although extremely difficult, but in the past our country has overcome greater crises and has never been destroyed by other countries, and it is still the same today. The spiritual strength on which the great countries that love peace rely will surely prevail one day. Our army takes this spiritual strength as its belief, and can also supplement it with material strength. Moreover, our country is fighting not to burn cities, massacre women and children, and inflict torture on those who are unable to defend themselves. On the contrary, we are fighting for justice and humanitarianism, so it can be predicted that we will defeat the enemy." (September 21st, Havas)

### British Secretary of War Visits France Again

London: It was officially announced that Secretary of War Hore-Belisha held a meeting in Paris yesterday with French Prime Minister Daladier and Commander-in-Chief of National Defense General Gamelin, and returned to the country to report on the situation. Today, he borrowed the same Minister without Portfolio, Sir Hankey, and went to Paris again to continue talks with Prime Minister Daladier and General Gamelin. Afterwards, he met with the commander of the British army and inspected the British army in a certain place. (September 21st, Havas)

### Britain Increases Output of Military Supplies

London: Minister of Munitions Burgin recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, reporting on the progress of the department's work to increase the output of military supplies, stating that the government has decided to establish a Military Supply Coordination Committee, with himself as chairman, and Lord Weir as the head of the explosives group. There are already 700 factories across the country specializing in the production of various shells, and there are 9,000 factories that can manufacture munitions for the government at any time. The government has signed contracts with 8,500 factories, entrusting them with the manufacture of various military supplies. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Greenwood, immediately stood up and delivered a speech, fiercely criticizing it, stating that hearing Burgin's speech made him feel very uncomfortable, and that this kind of bureaucratic speech would be difficult to win the trust of the public. Since the start of the war, this is the most unfortunate speech. (September 21st, Havas)

### New York Foreign Exchange Market

New York: In the New York foreign exchange market today, the pound sterling jumped to above four dollars, with a low of three dollars and ninety-three cents, a high of four dollars and a half cents, and a closing price of three dollars, ninety-nine cents, and three seven five. The reasons for the firmness of the pound are as follows: (1) Short covering, (2) the Bank of England is supplying more dollars than before at a fixed price, (3) the selling pressure from neutral countries has dried up. European currencies such as the French franc also rose with the pound sterling, especially the Dutch guilder, because the Dutch authorities have temporarily purchased pounds sterling to adjust. The Italian lira also fell to a new low. (September 21st, Reuters)

### Fierce Battle Outside Tongcheng

Pingjiang: After Tongcheng in southern Hubei was recovered by the Chinese, the Japanese urgently reinforced it with more than 3,000 troops from Chongyang, joining the remnants of the Japanese who had retreated from Tongcheng, and equipped with several tanks. From 9:00 a.m. on the 21st, they launched a continuous counterattack against the Chinese. A fierce battle for Tongcheng broke out with the Chinese army, and as of the afternoon of the 22nd, they were still in a stalemate in the suburbs. (September 22nd dispatch)

### Peace Rumors Originate from Speculative Merchants

Chongqing: According to Chinese sources here today, the recent peace rumors were completely fabricated by speculative merchants in Shanghai. Their motivation for fabricating them is purely commercial, because in this way they can manipulate China's legal tender and profit from it. Moreover, at a time when Jingwei is currently trying to obtain peace for the Japanese and establish a "new central government," the central government will never support it. In short, the Chinese government is unwilling to consider peace proposals until Japan has truly removed its political or other aggression against China, because we cannot fail to estimate the sacrifices of the War of Resistance over the past two years. Although war is an unproductive undertaking, China cannot suffer the pain of national subjugation for the sake of peace. At the same time, all sectors here believe that there is currently no basis for peace talks between China and Japan. According to the observation of the intellectual class here, the recent peace rumors are also related to changes in the international situation. Germany and the Soviet Union are now targeting the British Empire, hoping that Japan will attack Hong Kong, Singapore, and other British possessions in the Far East. The recent armistice agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan is intended for this purpose. However, the Japanese warlords insist on resolving the China issue first, so peace between China and Japan is still out of the question. (September 22nd, Associated Press)

### Chinese Army Outside Guangzhou Launches Counteroffensive and Wins; Recovers Huaxian, Fuhe, and Other Places; Japanese Officers Suffer 2,800 Casualties

The Japanese troops who invaded Guangdong near Wengyuan have, in the past two months, fearing that the Chinese army would launch a counteroffensive against the important strongholds of Fengyong, Xinjie, Longkou, Taipingchang, and Shingang outside Guangzhou, increased their troops to the number of the ×th Division. The Chinese army, on the other hand, continued its offensive and launched a fourth heroic attack on the Japanese army. The number of Japanese casualties exceeded the record for killing enemies in all previous battles in the southern theater. At the beginning of the offensive, the Chinese army destroyed the Japanese army's rear communication, transportation, and supply lines, and attacked Japanese transport vehicles coming to reinforce from Guangzhou, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army. The Chinese army separately besieged the Japanese army. The Japanese army was suddenly attacked from both sides, and its formation was in great disarray. The Chinese army took the opportunity to annihilate them, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat for seven days and nights. On the evening of September 8th, the remaining Japanese troops collapsed and retreated across the line. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to recover Huaxian Chegang Street, Koutou Village, and Fuhe. In this battle, more than 2,500 Japanese officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, including one brigade commander and one regimental commander. Three prisoners, including Leng Rencang, were captured, and countless military weapons were seized. (September 21st dispatch)

The remaining Japanese troops collapsed and were unable to form a army. On the 20th, they recovered Daze and Du Ruan, and the number of Japanese officers and soldiers killed or wounded was more than 400. They are still pursuing. (September 22nd dispatch)

### Japanese Army Has Not Crossed the Han River; That Line Has Been Normal and Quiet Recently

Chongqing: According to a report from the front line received by the Chinese side, the Japanese propaganda that the Japanese army has crossed the Han River and is advancing towards Jingmen is not true. It is said that the line has been unusually quiet recently. (September 22nd, Haitong dispatch)

### Japanese Troops in Northern Hunan Suffer Setbacks; Fierce Fighting Continues at Caoxieling; Xiayan'an Northeast of Xinqiang Recaptured

Miluo: After firing thousands of shells on the evening of the 19th, Japanese troops in northern Hunan continued their advance with infantry toward the triangular area on the opposite bank of the Xinqiang River held by the Chinese army. Fierce fighting also broke out with the Chinese army in areas such as Daqiaoling, Leigongchuli, and Xiayan'an. Because the Chinese army was fighting with its back to the water, they were all determined to engage the Japanese troops in hand-to-hand combat. By dawn, the invading Japanese troops had suffered heavy losses and retreated in defeat. On the 20th, the Japanese troops did not advance into the area again. Instead, they suddenly sent six or seven hundred infantry troops to attack Caoxieling, northeast of Xinqiang, along the official road from Xitang to Yangliujie. The Chinese army waited for the Japanese troops to approach before showering them with hand grenades, immediately routing them. At 9:00 AM, four hundred Japanese infantry troops came to reinforce, but they were still defeated by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 20th, when the battle at Caoxieling was at its most intense, the Japanese artillery on the north bank of the Xinqiang River indiscriminately shelled the area to support the fighting. Two Japanese warships in Dongting Lake also sailed to the waters off Jiaoluhumet and other places, firing their guns and shouting. There was also one Japanese aircraft conducting reconnaissance.

Guilin: Japanese troops in Xiayan'an, northeast of Xinqiang, retreated northward on the evening of the 20th, and Xiayan'an was thus announced to be recovered. Furthermore, Japanese troops at Liushuchang (southeast of Xitang) fiercely attacked Caoxieling on the morning of the 20th but failed to achieve their objective. (Dispatch of the 21st)

### General Li Zongren Issues Statement: China's Resistance Strength Not Weakened by European War

Chongqing: General Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army on the north bank of the Yangtze River, told visiting reporters here yesterday that the interruption of overseas arms supplies due to the European war would not weaken China's resistance forces. Taking aircraft as an example, we had purchased a large number of aircraft from the Soviet Union, but up to now, aircraft have not occupied a very important position in China's resistance war. The number of Chinese Air Force sorties is very small. If China had no aircraft, the only result would be that Japanese aircraft would not encounter any resistance when bombing some inland cities. China is not an industrial country, so bombing its cities cannot destroy its resources or affect its strength. Li also expressed concern about the development of the European situation and stated that he was paying attention to the attitude of the United States. It is said that Japan will take advantage of the situation in Europe to eliminate the rights and interests of various countries in China. He also said that he personally opposes the theory of American isolationism. The aggression of Japan in recent years and the current state of the world are all caused by the fact that countries did not take active action when Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931. Therefore, the United States will never allow itself to stand by and watch the aggressors become more rampant, and its own country will inevitably be affected sooner or later. Li continued that after the fall of Hankou, the land recovered by the Chinese army was indeed more than before. Of the forty counties in northern Anhui, thirty are now in the hands of the Chinese army. In southern Henan, only Xinyang is occupied by the Japanese army. As for the area around eastern Hubei, the Chinese army has decisively recovered most of the cities near Huangmei, Guangji, and Xiushui. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

They fled in a panic. Gao'an was announced to be recovered. The number of Japanese officers and soldiers killed in this battle was unprecedented in recent times.

Xiushui: The Chinese and Japanese armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting near Gao'an in northern Jiangxi. Since the 17th, the Japanese army has divided its forces to encircle Gao'an. One force of approximately three thousand troops invaded from the west of Fengxin. On the 17th, they occupied Shangfu, west of Fengxin, and then continued to flee southward. On the 18th, they occupied Cunqian Street, northeast of Gao'an, and continued to advance south, attempting to cut off Gao'an's rear. Another force of more than three thousand troops directly attacked Xiangfuguan, northeast of Gao'an, hoping to coordinate with the Japanese troops advancing south from Tingdi in Fengxin to encircle Gao'an. At that time, although the Chinese army in Gao'an was in an unfavorable situation of being attacked on both sides, it still demonstrated the spirit of independent combat and met the Japanese troops head-on along different routes. The fierce fighting continued until the evening of the 19th, and the two Japanese forces gradually approached the city of Gao'an. The Chinese army then concentrated its forces on Gao'an and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese force advancing south from Cunqian. On the morning of the 20th, they successively recovered Cunqian and Shangfu, and continued to advance toward Fengxin. (Dispatch of the 21st)

### Jiang Kai-shek Concurrently Manages Sichuan Affairs; Enthusiastic Support from All Quarters; Deng Xihou Issues Earnest Statement; Public Organizations in Chengdu Send Telegrams of Welcome

Chengdu: The National Government officially announced that Chairman Jiang Kai-shek would concurrently manage Sichuan affairs. The news spread, and all the people were encouraged. Deng Xihou, Pan Wenhua, and Wang Zuanxu telegraphed the Chairman on the 20th, expressing their sincere support. The Chengdu Chamber of Commerce and the (116) Public Industry Association also sent congratulatory telegrams of welcome. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed He Guoguang, Deng Xihou, and other prominent figures on the 20th. All stated that since Chairman Jiang led troops to Sichuan in the 24th year (of the Republic, i.e. 1935), he believed that Sichuan Province was rich in resources, and the people were honest and simple, which would serve as the base for national revival. He was willing to do his best to promote the progress of Sichuan Province and actively build Sichuan to serve as the foundation for nation-building. Now that he concurrently manages Sichuan affairs, it shows that Chairman Jiang attaches great importance to Sichuan Province and deeply loves the people of Sichuan. From now on, the rapid progress of Sichuan's construction and the improvement of people's lives have already begun, and this will correct international views and refresh the eyes and ears of the people of the country. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the general public is extraordinary. Deng Xihou said, "When I went to Chongqing to listen to instructions some time ago, the Chairman paid close attention to the construction of Sichuan Province, saying that he would use the strength of the whole country to build Sichuan. He also said that it is necessary to coordinate personnel and establish a foundation in order to gradually achieve governance and complete the task of a model province. The Chairman's emphasis on Sichuan and his love for the people of Sichuan are overflowing in his words. Recently, Chairman Wang expressed his desire to fight the war and requested to go to the front. The central government officially announced that the Chairman would concurrently serve as Chairman, in order to implement the above-mentioned propositions, and thereby correct international views and refresh the eyes and ears of the people of the country. How can this be merely joyful for the people of Sichuan? I have served in the military for decades, and have been given special treatment and entrusted with important tasks. I will lead the soldiers and civilians of Sichuan Province to closely follow the instructions and lay a solid foundation for Sichuan Province, completing the mission of a base for national revival. Furthermore, the government decree appointed Director He as the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government. Director He has assisted Chairman Jiang in governing Sichuan for many years, and is upright and fair, supported by officials and people. My friendship with him is very strong. From now on, military and political cooperation will inevitably become more flexible, without saying otherwise. In short, Chairman Jiang's concurrent management of Sichuan affairs has opened up a new situation for Sichuan. The great future depends on our talents and efforts to advance, and support the leader and obey orders. We must not just pay lip service, but must understand the Chairman's virtues and intentions, implement the Chairman's propositions, and build Sichuan and the nation. This is the time. I will do my best with Vice Director Pan to assist in the implementation of provincial policies in order to achieve this goal." He Guoguang said, "I only learned from the newspaper that the Sichuan Provincial Government was partially reorganized. During Chairman Wang's departure from Sichuan to fight the war, the Chairman of the Military Commission concurrently managed the provincial government, and I was entrusted to manage the official documents. I had not heard of this beforehand, and I have not yet received the instructions. I have nothing to report. However, the Chairman manages everything every day and also concurrently manages the provincial government, which makes me feel the Chairman's deep love for Sichuan and the importance of Sichuan in the national status. I have been studying and serving in Sichuan for more than ten years, and I have always been supported by the elders, comrades, and colleagues. I should work together under the direct leadership of the Chairman for the local area. However, my talent and knowledge are shallow, and I am not good at official documents. I am already worried about making mistakes in my original duties, and I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to live up to the expectations of the Chairman and the local officials. I intend to politely ask the Chairman for instructions." Furthermore, the Chengdu Chamber of Commerce telegraphed, "To Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission of the National Government of Chongqing, I recently read in the newspaper that the central government had approved the resignation of Chairman Wang of the Sichuan Provincial Government, who was determined to fight the war, and that the vacated position of Chairman was concurrently managed by Your Excellency. The auspicious news came, and all the people rejoiced. The Sichuan government will be bright, and everything will be renewed. We will rely on Your Excellency's virtue and sing praises. We hereby send a telegram of welcome, hoping that you will understand." Signed, Chengdu Chamber of Commerce and one hundred and sixteen trade associations. (Telegram of the 22nd)

### China Decides to Continue Resistance

Chongqing: Regarding rumors that the Chinese government has dispatched a certain important person to Moscow to conduct negotiations with Soviet Russia, well-informed sources here do not believe it, pointing out that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, is currently in the Russian capital, so there is no need to send another important person there. According to political figures, Chairman Jiang recently considered various situations and circumstances and decided to continue the resistance war no matter what. Chairman Jiang openly stated in the National Political Council yesterday that China still has a large amount of military supplies and four million troops that can fight Japan alone for another two or three years. At present, the Chinese government is actively developing resources and training new recruits to prepare for a long-term war. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 22nd)

### United States Prepares to Lend China a Large Sum of Money

Chongqing: Well-informed sources in financial circles stated last night that China may consult with the United States in the near future about a loan of 350 million US dollars. Although negotiations have not yet begun, financial circles believe that loan negotiations will begin soon. Political circles stated that China only "suggested" the possibility of this loan, awaiting the initiative of the US Export-Import Bank. Financial circles here indicated that the United States first lent China 25 million US dollars last December. Economic assistance from Britain and France, including a 3 million pound loan originally scheduled to be delivered last month, will not be obtained due to the outbreak of the European war. Financial circles hope to obtain more assistance from the United States. China does not expect reduced assistance from the Soviet Union. Experts from the American Fuxin Trading Company, which is participating in the US loan to China, are inspecting transportation and other transportation enterprises under the management of the Chinese government, and will report the economic situation in western China to the US government. The news that China intends to borrow a large sum of money from the United States was first revealed by the "Japan Times," run by the Japanese in New York, claiming that negotiations have made progress.

### Maintaining Shanghai West Police Authority: Increased Deployment of Detectives and Strict Precautions; Negotiations Haven't Seen New Developments; Patrol Teams and Puppet Police Nearly Clashed

In the area of the Shanghai West extra-Settlement roads, since the intrusion of Japanese puppet constitutional police, a confrontational situation has formed with the Municipal Council detectives. Although there have been several negotiations between the two sides, no results have been achieved. According to a certain British official, the extra-Settlement road issue officially started negotiations between the two sides on the 10th of this month. However, due to differences in opinions, no agreement could be reached, and negotiations have not made much progress to date. Currently, the British side insists on the principle of not abandoning the vested interests of the Settlement, and the British side will never easily tolerate anything that harms British interests.

Negotiation Process: Not Yet Concluded

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that the negotiations between the Municipal Council and the "Great Way" authorities regarding the extra-Settlement roads have not yet concluded. However, the number of "Great Way" police along the Route de la Victoire and Route Tenant de la Tour areas has increased since last night (the 21st). Municipal Council Secretary-General Phillips, in response to questions about this matter, stated that after his first meeting with Fu Xiao'an of the "Shanghai Municipal Government" in the city center last week, there have been no new developments in the negotiations.

Authorities Resolute: Maintain Police Authority

In the extra-Settlement road areas, the Japanese puppet side's actions to infringe on police authority are expanding daily. In recent days, the puppet police have occupied posts in several areas, and their deployment has even extended to the Haig Road area. In order to strengthen defenses, the police force has increased the deployment of Chinese and foreign detectives in key areas of Shanghai West since the day before yesterday, as a sign of their determination not to give up police authority in the area. Although the situation is very serious, fortunately no clashes have occurred. A record of the situation in the area yesterday is as follows:

Puppet Police Actions: Breaking Promises

The "Great Way" police authorities had previously promised that when they reoccupied the police station on Route Tenant de la Tour opposite Columbia Road, they would only operate behind the building. However, they seem to have broken this promise in the past two days, as the "Great Way" police are now directing traffic at the intersection. As for the traffic police in the area, due to the theft of three revolvers from patrol officers, most have been transferred to reinforce patrol teams.

Construction of Defenses in Several Locations

The Japanese puppet forces are constructing defenses at key strongholds, including: (1) the entrance of No. 11 Jessfield Road (Avenue Haig intersection); (2) the Jessfield Road bridge (Brennan Road intersection), the entrance of the Japanese military police West District Command and the puppet police sub-precinct; (3) in front of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank staff dormitory at No. 1760 Bubbling Well Road; (4) in front of the Lin mansion at No. 448 Haig Road. Except for the cement bunker at the entrance of the Japanese military police command, the defenses in the other three locations are sandbag bunkers. Six Japanese military police and puppet police are stationed at each location day and night, taking turns guarding.

Patrol Officers and Puppet Police: Facing Off for Days

The puppet police began occupying the patrol officers' posts starting from the 19th. The locations are: (1) Jessfield Road and Brennan Road intersection; (2) Jessfield Road and Connaught Road intersection; (3) Connaught Road and Singapore Road intersection; (4) Brennan Road and Edinburgh Road; (5) Edinburgh Road and Briston Road; (6) Jessfield Road and Robison Road; (7) Jessfield Road and Briston Road; (8) Caojiadu (Wujiaochang). There are also two locations at Bubbling Well Road and Route Doumer and Route Tenant de la Tour and Columbia Road. The patrol officers and puppet police are still facing off, stationed in the same location, directing traffic, and following closely behind each other.

Expanding Area: Approaching the Border

The deployment locations of the puppet police are increasing daily. As of yesterday, the locations on Jessfield Road include: (1) next to No. 15 (entrance of the Maoshengkang Timber Company); (2) Kangjia Bridge; (3) Jinjia Lane; (4) Briston Road intersection. On Yuyuan Road, the locations are: (1) Route Doumer intersection; (2) Siming Villa; (3) Zhongshi New Village; (4) Jianjia Lane; (5) entrance of the Toyota Spinning Mill staff dormitory at No. 1249; (6) Zhaofeng Park (Briston Road intersection). On Bubbling Well Road, there is the Meiliyuan area. On Route Tenant de la Tour, there are the Wangjia Lane and Zaijia Lane areas. The puppet police are stationed at the Fahua Bridge on Columbia Road. Since the puppet police intruded and deployed posts at the intersection of Haig Road and Edinburgh Road the day before yesterday, the police force has been dispatching a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives and an armored car to guard the area every day, making the situation very tense. At the intersection of Connaught Road and Jinsidu Temple, there is only one puppet policeman, holding a short stick and patrolling back and forth. As for the Rizhao Fang in Lane 909 of Yuyuan Road, which the Japanese puppet forces occupied at 10:00 am on the 20th, the four puppet police stationed there had already withdrawn the day before yesterday afternoon.

Two Sides Encounter: Nearly Leading to Conflict

The actions of the puppet police in Shanghai West have been very arrogant in recent days, parading in formation in various places all day long. At 8:00 am yesterday in Caojiadu and at 4:00 pm at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Route Doumer, the puppet police encountered the patrol officer patrol team twice. The two sides faced each other with guns, holding each other for half an hour, nearly leading to conflict. The residents of the area are deeply stimulated and have the intention of moving to a better place. Therefore, the wooden poles are full of rental notices, indicating that there are many empty houses and few people care.

### Issuance of Foreign Exchange Certificates: Not Needed for Now

It is rumored that the Chinese government will issue foreign exchange certificates, aiming to prevent the Japanese puppet forces from obtaining foreign exchange and determined to crack down on the Shanghai foreign exchange black market. A "New Voice" reporter visited a vice president of a bank engaged in foreign exchange business and a leader in the banking industry yesterday. According to them, the issuance of foreign exchange certificates is a thing of the past, as someone suggested this method in the beginning, but it was not adopted by the authorities, and there has been no news of it recently. However, since the establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, China's foreign exchange has been fully maintained, so the legal foreign exchange has always been the same. In fact, there is no need to issue foreign exchange certificates. The competent party authorities have also made no decision to crack down on the Shanghai black market foreign exchange.

### Area A of North Suzhou Creek: British Defense Forces Withdrew Yesterday; Japanese Side Sent Officers to Inspect; Shops and Residents in the Area Remain Quiet as Usual

After the British and Japanese military authorities stationed in Area A of North Suzhou Creek (between North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road) reached an agreement to restore the area to its pre-August 13th situation starting yesterday, the British troops stationed in the area implemented the withdrawal of their defenses after 10:00 am yesterday. The military telephones along North Jiangxi Road were moved to the area west of North Henan Road. The British troops inside the Jiangsu Automobile Company at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Baz Road were relocated to the Qianjiang Guild Hall at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, and posts were set up on the sidewalk on the west side of North Henan Road. When the British troops relocated, British officers, together with police officers from the Huishan and Huisi police stations, surveyed the boundaries, and the Huishan police station sent detectives to take over the police authority in the area. The procedures were not completed until 12:30 pm. The details are as follows:

British Garrison: Withdrew Yesterday

At 10:00 am yesterday, the defenses in all sections from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road remained unchanged. After 10:00 am, the British soldiers stationed in the Jiangsu Automobile Company at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Baz Road began to move their bedding and other supplies onto police vehicles and transport them to the Qianjiang Guild Hall at the west end of North Henan Road. The British defense forces stationed outside the barbed wire fence at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Baz Road and in front of the telephone company at the west end of Haining Road also withdrew. At the iron gate at the northern end of North Henan Road, one British soldier remained on guard. Traffic on the road to the Settlement was normal. At the side of the Qianjiang Guild Hall at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, the British soldiers added a post and stationed two British soldiers.

Japanese Side Blocking the Baz Road Intersection

Although the British troops in the area had withdrawn before noon yesterday, the Japanese side had not sent troops to take over the defense as of yesterday evening. At around 4:00 pm, more than ten Japanese soldiers, carrying iron wire and hammers, re-laid barbed wire in the gaps in the barbed wire fence that the British troops had opened at the entrance of the Jiangsu Automobile Company when they were stationed at the Baz Road intersection, blocking them.

Railway Hospital: Will Station Japanese Troops

According to a resident living at the Baz Road intersection, at 2:00 pm yesterday, two Japanese officers, accompanied by a Chinese translator, went to inspect the former British garrison location. According to the Chinese translator led by the Japanese officers, the Japanese side will use the former site of the Railway Hospital at the western end of Baz Road (now the 16th Refugee Shelter of the Tzu Lien Association) as the location to station Japanese defense troops.

Residents and Shops: Abnormally Calm

Although the British and Japanese defense lines in the area have changed, residents do not need passes and there are no physical barbed wire fences, so the residents are very calm. The shops are all operating normally, and the pedestrians are very bustling. Public buses on routes 5 and trams on routes 14 and 18 still use North Henan Road as the terminus. The number of residents relocating has decreased significantly.

North Jiangxi Road: Residents Injected

As for the residents in the eastern area of North Jiangxi Road, since being blocked by the Japanese side with barbed wire fences, only two gaps have been opened at the intersections of Wenchang Road and Haining Road, and they must have passes to enter and exit. Yesterday morning, the Japanese side administered the second round of epidemic prevention injections to residents passing through these two gaps. After the injection procedures, the Japanese side stamped a "Second Vaccination Completed" mark on the passes before allowing them to continue residing within the blocked area.

### Refugees in the Tzu Lien Shelter: Have Already Started to Be Dispersed; Adult Refugees to Register Starting Today; Elderly and Frail to Be Sheltered Separately

The Yunnan Road Tzu Lien General Association is now ending its operations, and all 18,611 refugees in the 14 shelters will be dispersed in three phases according to the post-war conference agreement. The first phase of dispersal is for adult refugees, and registration has begun today (the 22nd). It is heard that the association, in consideration of the suffering of the refugees who have been displaced, will provide assistance with procedures for those who wish to return to their hometowns, or issue dispersal certificates to facilitate their return. As for the elderly, frail, and homeless refugees, the General Association has planned to continue running a larger shelter to accommodate them and spare them the suffering of displacement. According to a report from the Municipal Council Health Department on the 21st of this month, there are currently 30 refugee shelters inspected by the department, accommodating a total of 39,415 refugees.

### Moufu Ship Resumes Shanghai-Ningbo Route: Already Decided

Shanghai Factory Products Shipped to Ningbo: Zhejiang Provincial Government Approved

The Moufu ship of the Lihua Yangxing Shipping Department, which runs the Shanghai-Ningbo line, was unloading cargo at Zhenhai Port when the European war broke out. It was ordered by the consulate to wait for orders at Zhenhai Port. Later, it suddenly arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 14th of this month and entered the port at noon on the 15th, causing a small incident. It has now been resolved and is scheduled to set sail at 4:00 pm tomorrow (the 24th).

The De Ping ship of the China-Italy Company to Zhenhai Port arrived in Shanghai on the 26th and is scheduled to depart for Ningbo on the afternoon of the 27th. If the procedures are not completed in time, it will be postponed for one day. The Taikoo Company's Yingzhou ship is still loading cargo in Zhenhai Port. After loading, it will either return to Shanghai or go to Hong Kong. Because the company is a British merchant, it is afraid of accidents, so its whereabouts are kept secret. According to news from the shipping industry, the Ningbo Defense Command has established a Ningbo Import and Export Goods Inspection Office to prevent contraband and inferior goods from entering the inland areas, and implements strict management and inspection. With the approval of the provincial government, the names of the goods from Shanghai factories approved for import to Ningbo have been notified for inspection and release. The list of items is as follows: Maimaishan biscuits, Taikang biscuits, braised beef, Xiangtian Factory's local sweets, Huaou Factory's Huishi fruit candy, Xiang candy, hard candy, large hard candy, Jinlun Knitting Factory's Sanju money socks, Yushengxiang Weaving Factory's A-brand towels, Jinglun Cotton Weaving Factory's Crane brand towels, Great China Rubber Factory's Double Money galoshes, Yisheng Rubber Factory's Arrow Drum galoshes, Zhenzi Toothbrush Factory's Gourd toothbrush, Huacheng Thread Factory's Red Lion wooden yarn, Yaxin Factory's BMW buttons, Zhufeng Enamel Factory's Sansheng enamel basins, Sanyi Electric Factory's Sanyi military lamps, Wuhe Factory's Goose brand undershirts, Zhenfeng Factory's Ji brand undershirts, Jiuyi Knitting Factory's San Tao line socks, Jinglun Knitting Factory's Sanju line socks, Zhenfeng Lichang Factory's various brands of cotton gloves, Xinsheng Machine-made Button Factory's butterfly buttons, Great China Rubber Factory's Jin Qian rubber shoes, Yonglong Yushengxiang Factory's various brands of gauze towels, Yuankangxiang towels, Bunneman and He Xing Company's large-sized Lux soap, Brown Olive Company's Zhongzi brown olive soap, Xizi Brown Olive soap, Golden Chicken soap, Lever Brothers Lever Pharmacy soap, Huaju Industrial Society's Chinese black electric powder, Xiangmaoxiangmao soap.

### After Rumors Subside: Financial Fluctuations Stabilize Greatly; Actual Foreign Exchange Market Prices Retract and Tend to Stabilize; Government Bonds Drop Slightly, Foreign Currency Market Prices All Rise

The financial market in Shanghai after the fall, including the black market for foreign exchange and the dark market for gold, is entirely the work of speculators stirring up trouble. On the one hand, they are motivated by rumors, and on the other hand, they follow the whims of these people. When they are short, they collect everything they can, and when they are long, they dump everything. Legitimate merchants are just bystanders. Now that commercial activities around the world are subject to strict restrictions, it is difficult for import merchants to survive, so the fluctuations in exchange rates also shift according to the intentions of speculators. The rumors in the Shanghai financial market, such as Song Ziwen's flight to the Soviet Union, Japan's Konoe arriving in Hong Kong, and the so-called five-nation alliance, have all been proven to be unfounded. Therefore, rumors in the market yesterday gradually subsided, people's minds were slightly at ease, the actual foreign exchange black market prices retracted and tended to stabilize, the dark market for gold has rebounded, government bond market prices have fallen slightly, foreign currency market prices have all risen, and the remittance discount has slightly increased.

### Wartime Finance Enters a New Stage: Organization Becomes More Sound; Legal Tender Value Maintained Throughout; Absorbing Idle Capital and Eliminating Speculation; Remittance Fees for Inland-Shanghai Funds Drop Greatly

After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Ministry of Finance first announced measures to stabilize finance to calm the hearts of the people in a state of panic. Then, it implemented foreign exchange control measures to prevent the escape of funds. In March of this year, the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee was established, responsible for controlling foreign exchange to stabilize the foreign value of legal tender. In addition, there were also joint discount measures by the four banks to adjust urban finance, and measures to improve local financial institutions to promote rural production. It was also recognized that wartime financial policies should passively stabilize finance and actively promote finance. However, promoting finance must be based on stabilizing finance. If finance is stable, then all industries, agriculture and industry, can settle down to production. Stabilizing finance must also be supplemented by promoting finance. Increasing productivity can produce materials that do not need to be imported, and increasing exports can improve the international balance of payments. This has a great effect on supplementing the foreign exchange fund and preventing price increases. Now, in order to strengthen wartime financial policies, the outline of measures to consolidate finance and the outline of measures to improve central finance were promulgated on the 8th of this month. The former is the basic strategy for stabilizing or promoting finance, and the latter is the necessary measure for unifying financial institutions.

Overall Finance: Becoming More Consolidated

The outline of measures to consolidate finance includes legal tender reserve and inspection announcements, review of budget standards, stabilization of foreign exchange market prices, absorption of idle social capital, and expansion of the financial system. Now, in addition to the original gold, silver, and foreign exchange, short-term commercial paper, cargo warehouse receipts, investments in production enterprises, and government bonds issued by the National Government have been added to the reserve. It is now divided into cash reserve and guarantee reserve, which was previously vague, and clearer regulations have been made on the items. The restriction that government bonds used as a reserve cannot exceed 40% sufficiently guarantees that legal tender will not be issued excessively. Regarding the stabilization of foreign exchange, there were originally foreign exchange application procedures. Now, the foreign exchange review committee is also responsible for supplying foreign exchange in accordance with the announced application rules, so that legitimate needs can be met, demonstrating the government's determination to maintain the foreign value of legal tender. During wartime inflation, this is mostly due to government deficits. Now, in order to reduce expenditures, specific budget standards are set to save on unnecessary expenses and consolidate the financial foundation. As for actively promoting financial measures, developing internal resources and absorbing idle social capital can eliminate the wind of speculation.

Sound Organization: Authorizing the Four Banks

The outline of measures to improve the central financial institutions stipulates that the four banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, form a joint office to handle all special businesses related to the government's wartime financial policies. The above-mentioned outline of measures to consolidate finance is only the standard for financial policies, and how to implement them still depends on the operation of the implementing agencies. Previously, the four banks had an organization of joint offices, but its purpose was limited to discounts. Before the establishment of the Central Reserve Bank, it was considered necessary to centralize its leading finance. However, the past joint venture of the four banks was not truly unified. To be effective, its organization must be further strengthened. The outline of measures to improve the central financial institutions is to establish a joint office, authorized by the Ministry of Finance, so that it can take convenient measures and exercise its powers on behalf of the four banks during extraordinary times. In addition, the financial connections of the entire country and the financial administration will be linked, so that when local finance changes, the four banks can contribute opinions at any time, and when the Ministry of Finance has emergency financial facilities, the four banks can serve as the government's implementing agency. Therefore, China's wartime finance has entered a new stage.

Chongqing-Shanghai Remittances: Fees Drop Greatly

Reuters Chongqing, 22nd- The remittance fees from the inland to Shanghai have fallen unprecedentedly this week. It is believed that due to the impact of the European war and Japan's threat to increase its jurisdiction over Shanghai, the fees for remittances from the inland to Shanghai at the end of July and the beginning of August were 50 yuan per 100 yuan. Now it has been reduced to 22 yuan per 100 yuan. The exchange rate for Shanghai remittances is 18% to 22%. Financial sources believe that the recent influx of wealthy people from Hong Kong to Chongqing with large sums of money and the fact that Shanghai is not a safe place to deposit funds are the reasons for the drop in remittance rates. The financial community in Chongqing is quite pleased with this, because the drop in remittance rates means that the regulations to prevent the escape of funds do not need to be implemented temporarily. Bankers feel that funds are not only not flowing out, but are flowing into the interior.

### US Shipping Commission: Far East Shipping Plan; Four Mail Ships Completed Within the Year; "Nai Dong" to Inaugurate Shanghai Route

The US Shipping Commission, because the US Mail Steamship Company and the US Great Eastern Line Steamship Company stopped running the Far East route, feared that passenger and cargo shipping between China and the US would be hindered. Therefore, it formed the Puget Sound Orient Shipping Company, originally scheduled to send the Satartia from the west coast of the United States to Shanghai, expected to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. However, because there were no passengers or cargo to unload in Shanghai, it was ordered to pass through Shanghai without stopping. Afterwards, the maiden voyage will be undertaken by the "Nai Dong," scheduled to leave Puget Sound on September 25 and arrive in Shanghai on October 25. It will not stop at other ports along the way, but will go directly to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila. However, on the return trip, it will also stop at Japanese ports. The company also has two ships, the "Kabiriwo" and the "Kalinwa," dedicated to this route. According to the large-scale Far East shipping plan proposed by the US Shipping Commission, it is preparing to complete four 14,000-ton Far East mail ships by the end of this year, with a speed of 16 nautical miles per hour, powered by diesel engines, slightly larger and more comfortable than the world-class ships of the American President Line Steamship Company.

Haiphong Cargo Shipping: Still Crowded

It was previously rumored that the French Indochina government, due to the situation, would requisition all public and private warehouses at any time when necessary for the storage of military supplies. General export merchants in this port regard Haiphong as a shortcut to the southwest. Although Saigon can also be imported, the journey is 700 miles longer, and the burden of transporting goods will be much heavier. They are all very panicked. In recent days, many people have been inquiring about the shipping industry. The Dazhong News Agency reporter learned from the shipping industry that the various Nanyang route ships in this port have not yet received news that Haiphong will requisition public and private warehouses. Therefore, the ships sailing to Haiphong are still carrying cargo as usual, and there have been no suspensions or other situations. Because the rise in foreign goods is not suppressed, the inland areas are ordering one after another. The various ships in this port that are about to sail to Haiphong are all very crowded with cargo.

British and French Liners: Operating as Usual

The various foreign steamship companies in this port are now actively planning to resume the routes between Europe and Shanghai. According to the Daguan News Agency reporter, in addition to the Italian Liner Company's Conte Biancamano, which is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Genoa, Italy, tomorrow morning, the British Liner Company's Malipette is also scheduled to depart for London, England, on the 26th, and the French Liner Company's Athos II is also scheduled to depart for Marseille, France, on the 26th. The procedures for passenger tickets have already begun, and a large number of passengers and goods destined for Europe have been loaded onto the ships. It is currently difficult to predict the date of these ships' return trips from Europe to Shanghai. It is also learned that the American Mail Steamship Company's President Coolidge is also scheduled to depart for San Francisco, Los Angeles, Honolulu, New York, and other ports in North America on the 26th. It is said that the passengers and goods to be transported are also goods that the various foreign firms in Shanghai had booked from Shanghai commercial firms earlier. They have been accumulated until now before being handed over to the ship for transport.

French Ship Passes Through Shanghai; Italian Ship Returns Home

The French Liner Company's irregular liner Yangzi arrived in Shanghai from Europe on the 5th of this month and was originally scheduled to go to Japan on the 8th. At that time, due to mechanical damage, workers were hired to repair it, and it was delayed until the morning of the 12th before it left Shanghai for Japan. The ship was previously expected to return to Shanghai from Japan on the 25th and return to Europe that day. It has now been learned that it can be advanced by one day and is scheduled to enter the port tomorrow morning (the 24th), preparing to dock at buoys 14 and 15 to load cargo, and is scheduled to set sail and return to Europe in the afternoon of that day (the 24th). The Italian Liner Company's regular European-Asian route liner Conte Biancamano arrived in Shanghai from Europe on the 12th of this month. According to the schedule, it should have returned to Europe on the 14th. On that day, the company's alternate liner Giulio Cesare was delayed until the 14th due to the European situation before returning to Europe. Therefore, the export procedures for the Conte Biancamano could not be completed in time, and the export date was changed. It is now scheduled to set sail tomorrow morning and return to Genoa. Passengers must go to the new customs wharf at 9:00 pm tonight to board the small ship prepared by the company to take them to the large ship. The company's regular liner Conte Verde, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, has now been cancelled to adjust the schedule. Therefore, the scheduled arrival in Shanghai tomorrow has been cancelled. The Victoria is operating as usual and has already set off for China and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 9th of next month.

### Accomplished Sale of Tribute Rice at Fixed Price; Crushed Rice to be Sold at Fixed Price Tomorrow; Regulations Specify Two Types of Rice Tickets: Five Sheng and One Dou; First Fixed-Price Sale Location Successfully Concluded; Rice Prices to Drop by a Maximum of Eight Yuan Within a Week

Since the start of the fixed-price sale of Saigon rice in the two concessions, the majority has already been sold. There remain one thousand bags of crushed rice, scheduled to be distributed to various fixed-price sale locations starting tomorrow to continue the fixed-price sale for one day. It is scheduled to conclude after the day after tomorrow. The Rice Dealers Association yesterday issued a notice to proceed. The first fixed-price sale location, after concluding on the 20th, has completed the procedures. Various organizations, recognizing the dedication and diligent service of the staff, will provide rewards. The details are as follows:

Announcement: Crushed Rice to be Sold at Fixed Price Tomorrow

The Shanghai Rice Dealers Association, having nearly sold out the eight thousand bags of Saigon rice, will sell one thousand bags of crushed rice at a fixed price starting tomorrow. The association sent a letter to all fixed-price sale locations yesterday stating, "Regarding the amount of tribute rice sold at a fixed price, it is expected to be sold out by today. There remain one thousand bags of crushed rice, to be evenly distributed among the four fixed-price sale locations to continue the fixed-price sale for one day. The fixed price for crushed rice is set at one yuan and forty cents in national currency per dou. The limit for each person is five sheng or one dou. All fixed-price sale locations will conclude after selling out the crushed rice starting from the 24th of this month. This announcement is hereby issued, along with a notice for posting to inform the public. The rice tickets for one dou and five sheng used for the sale of crushed rice will have a secret mark stamp of crushed rice added by each fixed-price sale location for identification."

First Location's Procedures Concluded

Information was obtained from the person in charge of the first fixed-price sale location yesterday. The location concluded operations on the 20th of this month and merged with the second fixed-price sale location at the corner of Avenue Road and Carter Road. All procedures have now been completed and are published below: The first fixed-price sale location began on the 16th of this month and concluded on the 20th, selling a total of eight hundred bags of tribute rice, totaling nine hundred fifty-nine shi, seven dou, and eight sheng, for a total of nineteen thousand one hundred ninety-five yuan and six jiao in national currency. There was a shortage of twenty-five shi, five dou, and five sheng in quantity. There were also thirty-one jin of loose rice, two one-dou rice tickets that had been sold but the rice not yet claimed, pending collection. One hundred jin of bottom-of-the-pile rice were taken back by the supervisor Sun Zongqiao of that location. All procedures have been transferred to the Shanghai Rice Dealers Association for review.

Organizations to Reward Staff

Various organizations entrusted the Shanghai Rice Dealers Association to handle the fixed-price sale of eight thousand bags of Saigon rice, divided into five locations: three in the British Concession and two in the French Concession. Since the start of operations on the 16th of this month, the results have been remarkable. However, in addition to the commissioners dispatched by the Rice Dealers Association to preside over each location, all personnel at each location responsible for receiving rice and selling tickets were recruited from nearby rice shops. Civilians flocked to each location to purchase rice at the fixed price, causing severe crowding. Although the authorities of the two concessions dispatched police to protect and maintain order, all personnel provided diligent service and did not shrink from hardship. It is understood that the relevant organizations and the Rice Dealers Association, in order to reward the service spirit of all personnel, will discuss reward methods after the four fixed-price sale locations conclude.

Shanghai Rice Prices After Fixed-Price Sale

Since the implementation of the fixed-price sale of Saigon rice in five districts, most of the eight thousand bags have been sold, and it is scheduled to conclude today. The fixed-price sale of crushed rice will begin tomorrow. In recent days, the common people have been competing to purchase rice, with over four or five thousand people in each district daily. As a result, retail sales in rice shops have become increasingly deserted, and rice prices have also continuously fallen. Yesterday, in addition to glutinous rice falling by two yuan and long-grain rice falling by six jiao, early-season rice, early indica rice, japonica rice, and standard indica rice all fell by about five jiao. In the past week, the maximum drop for each grade was eight yuan, and the minimum drop was five yuan. All of this was driven by the fixed-price sale of Saigon rice. Yesterday, three boats arrived via inland waterways, totaling two hundred thirty shi. Four thousand nine hundred thirty-two bags were offered for sale, with over four thousand bags sold. As for registration for purchasing Saigon rice, it has reached over a hundred companies, totaling over sixteen thousand bags.

### Rumors of Imposter Consolidated Tax Bureau Director Being Replaced

The identity of his successor will be investigated further.

### Ferry Service on Huangpu River Disrupted Yesterday Morning

Starting at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, ferry traffic between Nanshi and Pudong was suddenly disrupted, and ferries were forced to stop operating. The reason was that Japanese troops were being mobilized and military supplies were being loaded. The ferry terminals on both the east and west banks were guarded by Japanese troops, prohibiting civilians from passing. The situation was extremely tense. The service was not restored until 3:00 PM, with a total interruption of water traffic for six hours.

### Unable to Resume Work at Lun Chang Factory; Workers Face Difficulties

The labor dispute at the British-owned Lun Chang Factory in Pudong has been unable to resolve, due to various threats and the inadequacy of financial assistance. The stalemate has lasted for more than four months. The day before yesterday afternoon, a notice was distributed on Dongchang Road stating that "Relief funds of five yuan per person are being provided." Generally, workers at the factory originally earned dozens of yuan per month, which was barely enough to maintain their families' livelihoods. Since the dispute began, the monthly relief funds have been less than ten yuan, severely impacting their livelihoods. Many want to cry but have no tears. Some families rely entirely on one person's income to survive, and the relief funds of less than ten yuan per month are not enough to live on, making their plight unspeakable and even more miserable.

### Sino-US Trade Surges Starting in September; Export of Native Goods Unaffected by European War; American Trading Firms Flourish

Since the outbreak of the European war, trade between Britain, Germany, and France with China has sharply declined, while trade between the United States and China has surged. China exports primarily silk, tung oil, animal products, raw and finished leather, etc., to the United States. Imports from the United States include metals and ores, oil, wax, vehicles and boats, timber, etc. At the same time, the Chinese government is making every effort to adjust trade with the United States. The details are as follows:

Trade Improves After Adjustment

From January to July of this year, the value of imports of foreign goods from the United States totaled 54.683 million gold customs units, an increase of 11.793 million gold customs units compared to the same period last year. The value of exports of native goods totaled 79.875 million yuan in national currency, an increase of 41.077 million yuan compared to the same period last year. Since the outbreak of the European war, trade between Britain, France, Germany, and other countries with China has plummeted. In order to maintain foreign trade, the Chinese government has made every effort to adjust trade with the United States, and trade between China and the United States has improved.

Large Amounts of Native Goods Exported from China to the United States

Starting in September of this year, large quantities of native goods, such as tung oil, bristles, textiles, fibers, animal products, raw and finished leather, metal ores, yarn and woven products, and knitted goods, are being exported from Shanghai, Tianjin, Hong Kong, and other ports to the United States, with a value of 15 million yuan in national currency. In addition, barter agreements have been established for tung oil, bristles, and other goods. Therefore, the prices of raw silk and tung oil in the Shanghai market are not affected by the European war and are not falling. It is reported that the number of ships operated by the American President Lines on the Sino-US route has increased dramatically, the most in its history. The import trade of various American trading firms in China is thriving.

### French Concession Meat Industry Dispute Fully Resolved Last Night; French Municipal Council Establishes Mediation Terms; Slaughter Fee Increased, "Head Removal" Practice Abolished

Regarding the dispute between the fresh meat industry and the slaughtering industry in the French Concession over slaughtering fees, the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association, French Concession Branch, stated in a letter that "Members of our association have complained that the slaughterers have been encroaching on the 'internal organs' that should be handed over. The slaughterers have been making one-sided statements to evade their legal responsibilities, and no agreement has been reached. We hereby declare this and request correction." It is heard that the matter was resolved yesterday after the French Municipal Council convened both parties for mediation. The details are as follows:

Very Little Fresh Meat Sold Yesterday

After negotiations between the meat industry in the French Concession and the slaughtering industry broke down over the issue of slaughtering fees, most of the fresh meat businesses temporarily suspended their purchases. Transactions in the fresh meat market were almost at a standstill. However, yesterday, a small amount of fresh meat was still sold in the French Concession. According to reporters from the Great China News Agency, most of this fresh meat was transported by the slaughterers themselves after butchering the piglets and selling them to vendors. Larger meat shops mostly suspended sales.

French Municipal Council Mediation Successful

Recognizing the severity of the situation and fearing that it would affect social order, the French Municipal Council convened the responsible parties from both sides again at the Police Department at 4:00 PM yesterday for mediation. Nine representatives from the meat industry and seven representatives from the slaughtering industry attended. In order to safeguard the interests of the citizens, both sides discussed the matter in a sincere manner. By 5:00 PM, a resolution was reached and the following terms were established: (1) The slaughtering fee will be increased by four jiao per head starting from the 18th of this month. (2) The slaughtering industry shall no longer engage in the "head removal" practice starting from the night of the 22nd of this month. (3) For the period from the 18th to the 21st of this month, the slaughtering industry shall compensate the meat industry two yuan and two jiao per head for all losses due to the head removal practice. (4) The responsibility for diseased and dead pigs (i.e., pigs rendered for oil) shall rest with the slaughtering industry. If any are discovered, they shall be compensated for at their value.

Meat Market to Return to Normal the Day After Tomorrow

Because the above terms were only established in the evening yesterday, the meat industry was unable to purchase livestock and send them to the slaughterhouse for butchering. Therefore, the supply of fresh meat on the market today will still be greatly reduced. Tomorrow, it is expected to fully return to the state before the 18th of this month. Furthermore, the meat industry has already notified each meat shop to register the number of piglets that suffered losses due to the head removal practice during the four days with the Meat Industry Association today. The Meat Industry Association will then obtain full compensation from the slaughtering industry and distribute it to each meat shop on Monday, the 25th. All member meat shops can prepare a statement, stamp it, and collect the amount of their losses from the association at that time. It is also noted that the number of pigs that had their heads removed by the slaughtering industry during the four days was three thousand.

### Bizarre Murder Case at the Grand Cathay Hotel; Sixteen-Year-Old Boy Murdered

On the 25th of last month, a woman in her fifties, accompanied by a man in his twenties, brought a sixteen-year-old boy to stay in Room 323 of the Grand Cathay Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. They entered and exited daily without any unusual behavior. Until around 4:00 PM on the 28th, the tea boy, seeing that there was still no movement inside the room, opened the door to look inside and found a corpse on the bed. It was the sixteen-year-old nameless boy, lying stiff on the bed, having been dead for some time. The man and woman had disappeared at some unknown time. The incident was extremely bizarre and was reported to the police station, who sent the body to the examination room on Jiaozhou Road. The First Special Court was requested to send a prosecutor and a forensic doctor to conduct an autopsy. The results of the autopsy revealed that the boy had died from poisoning before his death. Since there were no family members, the body was handed over to the Pushen Shanzhuang for burial in a coffin. The police station launched a strict investigation, but the case has not yet been solved. When the man and woman abandoned the body and fled, they left behind many items of clothing in the room. These items were inspected by the police station and handed over to the First Special Court for storage. The court is now issuing a public notice, limiting the relevant parties to claim the items within six months. If the deadline is missed, the items will be confiscated.

It was stated that the defendant was previously a bailiff at the Nanshi Court and often claimed to have no wife, wishing to be an adopted son-in-law. He seduced her in every possible way. Before the August 13th Incident, he seduced her into having sex with him in hotels such as the Ba Xian, Dongfang, and Aido, promising to marry her, but always delaying. Last spring, she became pregnant, and on November 22nd, she gave birth to a boy named Xiaomi, the second plaintiff.

### Embezzlement of Suit Case; Defendant Unwilling to Settle; Claims Clothes Have Already Been Taken

Wang Zuyou, the owner of the Huili Western Clothing Store at 263 Xiafei Road, a local native, was recently sued in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court by a customer, Yuan Yingshi (residing at 41 Guba Road, represented by lawyer Zhang Enhua), for embezzlement of a dark purple Harris material suit jacket worth 40 yuan, requesting investigation and attaching a civil suit to recover the clothes. It was stated that in August, the suit jacket was taken to the defendant's store, requesting alterations. The defendant issued a card stating "one piece of clothing" as a receipt. However, repeated requests to retrieve the clothes were unsuccessful, indicating an intent to embezzle. The police station was notified, ordering compensation, which was refused. He requested that the law be applied to investigate and recover the original clothes, etc. The court accepted the complaint and Judge Zhang Minsheng held a hearing, in which the defendant, represented by lawyer Zhang Shanle, argued that the clothes had already been taken. At that time, the plaintiff claimed that the card had been lost. Unexpectedly, he used it as evidence in the lawsuit, so he refused to compensate in the police station. The court ordered a rescheduling and ordered both parties to settle the civil suit out of court. However, the defendant did not pursue settlement. Another hearing was held the day before yesterday. The court advised the defendant to compensate ten yuan for the price of the clothes, which the plaintiff had already agreed to, but the defendant firmly refused. The court then ordered a debate and announced the conclusion, ordering the defendant to provide bail pending a scheduled judgment.

### Dance Hostess Li Lili Accuses Lover of Assault

Li Lili, a 22-year-old woman from Suzhou, works as a dance hostess at the Cathay Dance Hall on Yu Qiaqing Road. Around August or September of last year, she met Zhang Guoxin (24 years old), a Suzhou native residing at 5 Yulin Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, while she was dancing. Soon after, she began cohabitating with Zhang. However, Zhang repeatedly demanded money from her, using up all the money she earned from dancing. On the 11th of this month, a dispute arose again over the issue of demanding money. At that time, Zhang used violence, beating Li and injuring her. Her cheongsam was also torn, and her watch and wallet were taken away by Zhang. Li suffered greatly and could no longer continue cohabitating with him. Furthermore, she learned that Zhang already had a wife, and she was deceived by him. Therefore, she hired lawyer Yu Zhaolin to file a criminal complaint against Zhang in the First Court, requesting that he be punished according to Articles 335, 299, and 277 of the Criminal Code, and attaching a civil suit, requesting that he be ordered to return the 500 yuan in legal tender that was stored with Zhang, as well as the watch and wallet that were taken away.

### Car Shop Owner Missing; Thug Sentenced for Fraud

(From She Wen News Agency) Zhou Agui, the owner of the Kuai Li Bicycle Shop at 150 Lafayette Road, from Changshu, was suddenly invited by a friend to have tea at the Luochun Pavilion on June 1st of this year. Zhou left and never returned. His whereabouts are still unknown. A thug from Ningbo, Zai Chengwei, learned of this and thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of the situation.

Zhou's wife believed him and was defrauded of 500 yuan. Later, Zhou's wife realized she had been deceived and reported the matter to the French police station.

In the attached civil suit, the defendant must return the original 500 yuan to the plaintiff.

### Correspondence

To the Editor: With all due respect, the news item published in your newspaper on the 21st of this month, "Lawyer Yang Yiming Commits Assault, Stores Provide Joint Testimony, Witnessing Yang Beating an Old Woman," is inconsistent with the facts. I hereby provide a brief explanation as follows: Song Wang sued Yiming for the facts of the injury, and a letter requesting correction was sent to your newspaper on the 12th of the same month. On the 19th of the same month, the facts of the mediation of the marriage between Song Wenyu and Zhang Shunbao were published in the newspaper to warn Wu Youmei. Right and wrong will be judged fairly. As for the case under trial, the joint petition of the stores was found to be irregular and has been clarified in court, and it is not factual and has nothing to do with this case. Why add unnecessary complications and confuse the public? As for the injury case, we should wait for the court to make a public judgment, and the truth will eventually come to light. We should not engage in futile verbal disputes, as there is a fear that the rumors will be inaccurate. Therefore, I specially request a correction and hope that your newspaper will publish it in the "Correspondence" section to clarify the truth and correct public perception. Sincerely, Lawyer Yang Yiming, to the Shen Bao Newspaper.

### Trends in Teacher Education in Various Countries (II) Continental Europe's Unified Policy

(II) Germany: Germany has the longest compulsory education period. The first four years of elementary education are in basic schools, which belong to elementary schools, and the next four years are in national schools, which are in the same stage as other secondary school courses. Therefore, the training of teachers is completely improved in terms of academic standards, according to the Federal Constitution of 1919, and the principles of higher education are applied. However, the arrangements vary from state to state. Some are attached to other universities, some are specially established as two-year educational universities, and some have academic cultivation attached to other universities, while vocational practice is assigned to educational colleges. As of 1931, there were 35 educational universities in the country. Admission qualifications require a secondary school diploma, a resume, and a physical examination certificate. Music is tested for male students and sewing for female students to determine acceptance. During the two-year study period, the courses include educational subjects such as ethics, history, school health, school management, teaching materials, sociology, and internships. Applied subjects include philosophy, psychology, religion, geography, (local) ethnology (local), zoology and botany, (local), and anatomy, political science, and social economics. There are also art and technical practices, handicrafts or sewing, books, gymnastics, and lectures. During their studies, they should also visit various schools and social undertakings to broaden their horizons. However, formal teacher qualifications must still be obtained through two qualification examinations. The examination committee is appointed by the Minister of Education and is composed of teachers from other schools or new and old religious figures in the area. After passing the first examination and interning for two years, they must pass the second examination. Educational universities do not have affiliated elementary schools or use elementary schools in rural towns as substitutes.

German secondary schools are differentiated from the beginning, unlike other countries where subjects are divided into higher grades. This is called the functional composition method. Therefore, there are many types of secondary schools. Therefore, there is no specific special school for teacher training. The most important feature is the probationary period in the preparatory year. Those who want to become secondary school teachers must first complete four years of academic study at a university and then pass the national examination. The national examination is initially an academic examination and later a teacher examination. The preparatory year is in between these two examinations. Because university students who want to become secondary school teachers should, in addition to specializing in their original subjects, also select philosophy, education, and the courses they want to teach in the future as students of the normal department. Then, they should engage in actual teaching practice. Then, the Minister of Education appoints academic examiners to conduct academic examinations at various universities, with philosophy, ethics, youth theory, and epistemology as compulsory subjects. For the rest, each person chooses according to their own wishes for each subject. Those who pass are candidate teachers and enter the so-called two-year preparatory period. The first year is assigned to a six-year secondary school, and the second year is assigned to a nine-year secondary school, but no more than eight people per school. They are guided by the principal of the secondary school and specially selected teachers, but they may also ask other teachers for assistance. The first year is devoted to research on the educational system, teaching methods, and curriculum coordination. The second year is devoted to discussions on the general tasks of teachers. Two years later, based on the reports of the guiding principals, teachers, and supervisors of the secondary schools, they may be allowed to take the education examination. The education examination committee makes the final decision based on the comprehensive written examination, oral examination, and other results. Those who pass are assistant teachers and are entered into the register and can perform paid services. However, their lifelong license is granted by the Minister of Education and local authorities after careful consideration and selection, and only after five years of being entered into the list of candidates.

### Finance Rumors Proved Baseless Cash Rebounds

Yesterday's black market situation for cash was suddenly revealed by newspapers of the peace rumors fabricated by speculators in recent days, and it was generally believed that various things were inaccurate, and foreign exchange also surprisingly weakened compared with the looseness of the previous day. Therefore, the opening in the morning immediately rebounded sharply to 3,950 yuan. A certain gold store continued to absorb strongly and saw a peak of 3,970 yuan again. Later, due to the parity of supply and demand, the foreign exchange market slightly turned loose, and the price also slightly weakened accordingly, hovering around 3,900 yuan. It closed at 3,890 yuan at noon. After the noon close, rumors returned, so the off-market price fell to 3,860 yuan. However, before the afternoon opening, the securities brokers called out very strongly, reaching as low as 3,740 yuan. Later, a certain gold store set a limit price of 3,800 yuan to drag in, but the sellers immediately stopped selling, so it failed to succeed, which caused a dispute. The opening price was 3,820 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange was weak, and a certain gold store and a certain money exchange business were still buying strongly, so the price rose to 3,900 yuan. Although it once entered the 3,900 yuan level, it ultimately closed at 3,920 yuan, a sharp increase of 190 yuan compared with the previous day. After the close, the market situation became stronger. It was heard that the price on the platform was as high as 3,956 yuan. Transactions were brisk, about two thousand and several hundred taels. Silver shop jewelry ultimately hung up 25 yuan higher. Customs gold and other items remained consistently stable.

Spot Gold Rose by 190 Yuan

Since the early morning, each bar (ten taels) Initially, the opening was due to the various rumors of the previous day. The Chinese government has formally recognized that the air of peace for Japan has disappeared without a trace. In addition, foreign exchange has shrunk sharply, people's hearts are agitated, and they are raising prices wildly. A certain gold store first called out to buy at 3,830 yuan, but the sellers were still waiting and watching, under the cover of buying. The price was raised sharply by 120 yuan. A certain gold store entered 30 taels from money exchange businesses, for 3,950 yuan, a sharp increase of 220 yuan compared with the previous close. After opening, a certain gold store continued to absorb, and the price continued to rise by 20 yuan. A certain gold store entered 20 taels from money exchange businesses, for 3,970 yuan. At that time, silver shops were competing to sell, and a certain gold store suddenly vomited back. Seeing that foreign exchange turned stable, the price soon fell back by 100 yuan. Silver shops sold 10 taels to securities brokers, for 3,870 yuan. After this, securities brokers and money exchange businesses scrambled to absorb, soaring 70 yuan. Money exchange businesses entered cash from a certain cash gold store for 20 taels, for 3,940 yuan. Afterwards, foreign exchange became loose again, and fewer people were buying.

A gold store sold 10 taels to a money exchange business, for 3,850 yuan. Near noon, a rising wind suddenly started again, and the price rose by 40 yuan in an instant. A certain money exchange business entered 10 taels each from cash gold stores of the same industry, for 3,890 yuan as the noon closing price. It was heard that rumors reappeared after the close, and people's hearts were very tired. It was heard that small transactions were made as low as 3,860 yuan. In the early afternoon opening, a certain securities broker had a very strong selling intention. In addition, the buyers did not dare to take over, and the price was shouted as low as 3,740 yuan. However, at that time, a certain gold store was only

### Foreign Exchange Market Buying Frenzy Resumes

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The off-exchange trading of British and American currencies, due to the pervasive "peace atmosphere" in the market for days, which the government had formally denied, was completely swept away. As a result, the market trend suddenly softened. The morning opening saw the British-American exchange rate rise again by 7/125, so the British currency was tighter than the American currency. The British gold price was calculated at 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 0.625 pence, and the American exchange rate at 7.3125 yuan. After the opening, Chinese merchant speculators and others turned to buying, but foreign firms showed no intention to supply. This led to a situation where there were buyers but no sellers. Later, scalpers absorbed as much as possible at high prices, but foreign firms were only willing to offer prices to block the rise, leading to a continuous tight situation. The British gold price softened to 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 1.875 pence, and the American exchange rate broke through the 7 yuan mark, reaching 6.9375 yuan. After 10:20 AM, a certain American bank's selling appetite gradually increased, coupled with the successive sales by Chinese cotton yarn merchants and Chinese banks, so the market image slightly hardened. At noon closing, the central bank's gold price was calculated at 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 3.125 pence, and the American exchange rate at 7.125 yuan. In the afternoon, due to sudden activity by Japanese banks, the situation slightly softened again. As a result, the British exchange rate was 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 2.1875 pence, the American exchange rate was 7.09375 yuan, the British currency was tighter by 2.1875, and the American currency softer by 3.125. The trend of September-October futures was similar to the spot market. Trading was still active throughout the day. There were purchase limit orders at 3,800 yuan at the venue, and a certain money exchange firm was also entrusted by customers to buy in. However, sellers suddenly hesitated to watch, resulting in no transactions being heard. (It was heard that securities firms outside the venue sold to money exchange firms' retail departments at a price of 3,740 yuan per ten taels), so the price surged back sharply, rising rapidly by 80 yuan. A certain gold shop bought ten taels from a money exchange firm for 3,820 yuan. Later, because the buying trend of a certain gold shop and a certain money exchange firm was still strong, and due to the softening of the foreign exchange rate, the price rose by 80 yuan. A certain money exchange firm bought ten taels from a securities firm for 3,900 yuan. After this, retail investors and silver shops sold out, and the price fell back slightly by 25 yuan. Money exchange firms traded ten taels among themselves at a price of 3,875 yuan. After entering, the buying trend rose again, rising rapidly by 45 yuan. A money exchange firm bought ten taels from a certain gold shop for 3,920 yuan as the closing price, an increase of 190 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The entire day saw fluctuations of 150 yuan. The selling price of spot gold in gold shops was 10 yuan higher than the listed price, while the spot gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there were few transactions.

Ornamental Gold Price Changed to 400 Yuan

At the beginning, the exchange price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael was still 375 yuan, but at 9:30 AM, it suddenly jumped up by 20 yuan. At 11:00 AM, it fell back by 5 yuan. At noon, it rose back by 5 yuan. At 2:05 PM, it suddenly dropped sharply by 10 yuan. More than ten minutes later, it rose by 5 yuan. At 4:00 PM, it increased greatly by 5 yuan. At 4:45 PM in the evening, it increased by another 5 yuan. As a result, the listed price increased by 25 yuan. It was calculated that both Dahangtong and Xinhangtong changed the listed price to 400 yuan, and the purchase price was also reduced by about 20 yuan.

American Dollar Once Reached 7 Yuan

In the early morning, the London major exchange rates were all flat, New York's silver price was slightly higher at 0.25, and London's raw gold remained unchanged. Exchange rates between British currency and American currency, Shanghai currency, and French currency were all flat. The American currency against the British currency continued to rise by 7/125, against the Shanghai currency by 5 jiao, and against the French currency by 5 fen. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 0.625 pence for British gold and 7.3125 yuan for the American exchange rate. Compared with the previous closing, the British-American exchange rates were both tighter by 0.09375, which was due to continued fear of the British-American exchange rates. After the opening, because the rumors of a "peace atmosphere" that had been widely circulated the previous day had been formally denied by the government, it was eliminated. As a result, general Chinese merchants immediately shifted their target and engaged in large-scale absorption, and foreign firms' intention to supply was very weak, leading to a continuous tight and soft situation. It was calculated that Chinese merchants concluded spot British gold with foreign firms such as Banque Belge pour l'Etranger and Hollandsche Bank Unie, from 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 3.125 pence, shrinking to 2.1875 pence, and spot American currency from 7.125 yuan, tightening to 7 yuan. Until HSBC's listed prices were announced as unchanged, and the white silver balancing tax was also announced without any increase or decrease. After this, foreign firms offered central bank gold at 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 1.875 pence, and the American currency at 6.9375 yuan. Later, it once stabilized. Until 10:20 AM, a certain American bank suddenly had selling intentions and sold this month's American currency to Chinese merchants at 7 yuan. Later, Chinese cotton yarn merchants also sold spot American currency to foreign firms such as Chase National Bank at 7.125 yuan. At that time, a certain bank also sold spot American currency to foreign firms at 7.125 yuan. Near noon, Chinese banks also sold spot American currency to foreign firms at 7.1875 yuan, and spot British gold at 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 3.125 pence, so the process showed a slight hardening. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 3.125 pence for British gold and 7.125 yuan for the American currency, with British currency tighter by 0.09375 and American currency softer by 0.1875 compared to the morning opening.

As a Result, Both Spot and Futures Markets Tightened

The post-market situation showed a slight softening. Initially, a certain bank absorbed spot American currency from Chinese merchants at 7.125 yuan. After entering, the Japanese bank, Zhengjin Bank, suddenly came to absorb, causing the market situation to continue to tighten. It was calculated that the Japanese bank absorbed spot British gold from foreign firms at 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 2.8125 pence, and spot American currency at 7.09375 yuan. Then, Chinese merchants also concluded this month's American currency with a certain bank at 7.0625 yuan. Later, the tightest American currency was called over 7 yuan, and British gold was also called over 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 2.5 pence. Near the evening closing, a certain bank's selling intentions were slightly stronger, so the situation turned flat. It once sold spot American currency to fellow firms at 7.09375 yuan. Extended to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 2.8125 pence for British gold and 7.09375 yuan for the American currency, the same as this month's spot market. October British gold was 4 pounds, 4 shillings, 2.34375 pence, and American currency was 6.96875 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, both spot and futures British currency tightened by 2.1875, and American currency both shrunk by 3.125.

In the afternoon, it continued to rise to 87.5 yuan, an increase of 7.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association opened at 0.21 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities: Bullish Domestic Debt, Profit-Taking

Yesterday's security off-exchange market situation: Because the "peace atmosphere" had been denied by all parties, but people's hearts were still stable, the market price suddenly decreased by more than one yuan, forming a trend of large increases and small pullbacks. Then, the prices of public bonds were not very high, and it was easy to rise and difficult to fall. This was the theory of the current situation. Yesterday morning, most of the excess was released, and a sudden drop was seen. Class C even broke through the 7 yuan and 6 yuan marks. The afternoon immediately stabilized, and transactions were also rare. The trend should have a period of brewing. As a result, each bond fell back slightly by one yuan to 1.25 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

### Cotton Yarn: Cotton Yarn Buyers Actively Seize the Opportunity, Prices Soar by 40 Yuan

The yarn market, which had fallen for five consecutive days, turned upward yesterday because the rumors proved to be unfounded. The rising trend was rapid. Moreover, with the shrinking of foreign exchange and the rising of gold, people's hearts were firm. Therefore, the bulls seized the opportunity to become active, and the market changed from weak to strong. However, actual sales remained sluggish. Hong Kong merchants' purchases were not strong, but mainland merchants had some need for 10-count coarse yarn, so the situation was uniquely firm. The current situation has a psychological element, as people are still hesitant and undecided about the yarn market at the time of the new cotton market. However, ordering foreign cotton is still expensive, and it is difficult to calculate. The fundamental problem is that actual sales will reach a good state again. 44 bales of cotton yarn were transported to Iloilo on the 23rd.

The spot yarn market opened in the morning with a flat mood, because the false wind from the previous day had not dissipated, but there was a lack of sellers, because their prices had already been low. It was seldom heard that foreign exchange had changed to shrink, and the market rumors had subsided, and there was favorable news. Therefore, the buying trend suddenly rose, and the market advanced step by step. The selling price became harder and harder. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse spot goods rose from 740 yuan straight to 780 yuan. The warehouse receipt price rose from 690 yuan straight to 730 yuan. It was slightly flat in the middle, but the new buyers did not stop, and the closing price was still high. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1,115 bales were traded. The market price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 40 yuan, Tiannv rose by 40 yuan, Double Globe rose by 40 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn also rose by 20-30 yuan, etc. The amount bought by each gang is listed on the left:

### Daily Arrival Surges, Cotton Manufacturers Wait and See

The transaction of native cotton turned quiet, but the transaction of white-wrapped cotton still maintained a good level. In fact, the amount of purchases by all parties has been considerable in recent days. Moreover, the sources from the Subei area and Changyinsha and other places are currently unobstructed, and the daily arrival of goods is surging. Therefore, the factory is bound to stabilize its intentions. Therefore, recently, the factories have absolutely no reckless purchasing actions. However, the purchases of colleagues are very lively. Yesterday, more than 3,000 bales of general cotton arrived at the pier, and they were not all sold. The opening price of the goods with inferior body and bones was 138.5 yuan, because their moisture content was too high and they could not be stored for a long time. The goods with excellent quality still opened at 142 yuan, which was the same as the previous day, but the sales trend was slow, so the market state showed softening. 800-900 bales arrived in Changyinsha. The current situation of cotton is recorded on the left:

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai: Yesterday, the rumors in the market subsided, so the exchange rate turned tight. Last night's closing price of foreign cotton suddenly rose by more than ten yuan per picul, and the purchasing intentions of all parties also turned strong. However, the inventory in Shanghai is already thin, and the transaction amount is also very small. It is calculated that the price of American upland cotton is 180 yuan, White Lock cotton is 175 yuan, and Brazilian cotton is also opened, the price being more than 210 yuan.

Foreign cotton market price: New York's cotton market in the early morning, colleagues had slight transactions, and the market situation was very firm. The cotton price rose by 6-7 pounds. Due to the sale of southern sets, speculators suddenly closed most of the bullish positions, and the market situation turned tired. As a result, the closing price fell by 5-6 pounds compared with the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose by 6 rupees together with the forecast yesterday, Egypt rose by more than 20 pounds, and Liverpool fell by 3 pence.

### Piece Goods: Local Streets Absorb at Low Prices, Cloths Rise One After Another

National Cloth: Yesterday, the rumors gradually disappeared, and cash yarn and cotton all rose together. The cloth market has turned from loose to tight, and the transactions are gradually becoming lively. The cloth price in the morning market was flat. Then, after the local street merchants absorbed at low prices, the price rose slowly again. As a result, the price of white goods, coarse cloth, and fine twill rose by 0.1-0.25 yuan per bolt, and the price of bleached and dyed cloths and flannel rose by 0.3-0.6 yuan per bolt. The factory plate was more expensive than the market, and few were opened. The local street transactions were more than 500 pieces of white goods and colored goods. The Ningbo gang purchased more than 100 pieces of colored twill cloths and coarse cloths. The Guangdong gang purchased more than 4,000 bolts of serge, thread flannel, and colored twill cloths. Subei Funing, Taizhou, and Xinghua have recently added purchases vigorously, with 3,000 bolts of colored cloths, serge, and thread flannel transacted. Small Luzon in Southeast Asia, Singapore, and other places have continued to add 2,000 pieces of red Yangbiao bleached, dyed, and printed cloths.

Eastern Piece Goods: Because the price of white goods had fallen too much, the market's futures were still tight and did not loosen. Those with considerable strength in the same industry took advantage of the low price to collect cash. Yesterday, the market was immediately lively. The transaction of fine cloth and fine twill by the local customers reached 700-800 pieces, and the price gradually rose. The opening price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth in the morning was 21.5 yuan per bolt, and the price continued to rise to 21.75 yuan in the later market, an increase of about 1 yuan compared with the previous loosening. The price of fine twill also rose back by 0.5-1 yuan per bolt. Japanese merchants sold 200-odd bales of Dragon Head fine cloth for the next month's delivery in retail, at 22.75 yuan per bolt, which was 1 yuan higher than the spot goods. Still, there were those who accepted the offer, which shows the firmness of the foundation. The price of Four Gentlemen serge rose to 0.665 yuan per yard.

Export: Today, there were 64 pieces of cloth transported to Iloilo, and another 50 pieces transported to Wenzhou.

### Grain: Tu Geng's Sales Path is Ordinary, Ke Xian Added Half a Yuan

Du Rice: There were no arrivals in Hexia yesterday. The Xinche Lun Baozi continued to arrive in each new goods of more than 5,000 bags. The morning market was quite strong, but the sales yard was not as good as usual.

The transaction volume of the Unified Market is 5-6,000 bags.

Ke Xian: Yesterday, the arrival was reduced, less than 3,000 bags. The shop customers had a strong appetite due to the low prices. Therefore, the opening price in the morning had already been increased. Then, it was called up again. The Jing Wu Ge Xian in Jiangbei once rose by nearly Yuan. However, after the price was high, the interest in eating was immediately slowed down, and there were rumors that there were still entire batches of goods arriving on the way. The late market immediately returned to fatigue. As a result, it was only 0.4-0.5 yuan higher. The price of Jing Xian was 24.5 yuan, and the Jiangbei Wu Xian, etc. were from 24 yuan to 21 yuan.

### Japanese Factory Futures Flour, Both Banks and Warehouses are Absorbing, Market Price is Tightening by a Corner

### Occasional Reading Notes (Part 2)

— Qin Lao

Chinese scholar-officials only know to speak in accordance with those above them. Naturally, it's to please them, but sometimes it can be exceptionally unlucky.

Ye Mengde of the Song Dynasty recorded such a story in his "Shilin Yanyu": Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty changed the year title to "Qianyuan," and was very pleased with himself, saying that the year title was very fresh. Zhao Hanwang said on the side, "Yes, very fresh..." Unexpectedly, a scholar named Lu interrupted him in a clumsy way, saying, "This is a year title used by the false Shu." The emperor checked and found it was correct, so he was so angry that he smeared a brush on Hanwang's face. Hanwang went back with a painted face, and didn't dare to wash it off all night until the emperor said the next day, "Wash off your ghost face!" which was considered to have restored his human form.

The result of this flattery was very unique. Although he didn't suffer a great loss, it was enough to be unlucky. But why did the emperor want to smear him on the face with a brush? I think the meaning is probably nothing more than: "You kid, you really have no shame!"

But this is still considered good because he was not beheaded for flattery.

Also, a story recorded in Wu Song's notes, - Zhang Qixian's "Luoyang Jinshen Jiuwen Ji" recorded a section of Liang Taizu, saying that once, Liang Taizu sat under a willow tree and said, "Good willow tree." The officials who were sitting with him all stood up and boomed, "Good willow tree." Liang Taizu said again, "It's good to be a car head." Then there was another boom, "Head." But the result was that Liang Taizu knew that the willow tree was a car head, so he immediately ordered those who spoke in accordance with him to be killed in front of him.

But even so, our scholar-officials still spoke in accordance with those above them, because this kind of misfortune is, after all, an exception.

Not long ago, someone made a satirical text, which involved the name of his enemy. But that was just satirical text, not face-to-face criticism. But it aroused the dissatisfaction of the scholars, saying that it was too impure. That is naturally correct, but it is really a strange thing to find purity in satirical text. I don't know how, I actually encountered this kind of impurity of the ancients.

Luo Dajing's "Helin Yulu" recorded a passage of a Song Dynasty Taixuesheng scolding Liang Chengda, that sentence is: "It is appropriate to add a point next to the big character, saying Liang Chengquan."

I definitely don't advocate taking names as the material for scolding people, but I always feel that this is better than "Tai Fu is: ... elegant, elegant, ..."

### Garan (Monastery)

— Ding Ti

Autumn is still, spring is active. Living in a noisy city, one doesn't know the news autumn brings. Yet I gradually feel the room is becoming too cramped. I love sparseness, asymmetry, and vastness. I dislike the monotony of life; I need change. I also love the forests of autumn. I love white clouds, small vegetable gardens, and high, refreshing open country. I know it is autumn. Usually, there are two tides in my heart each year: a love of stillness, that is autumn; a love of activity, that is spring.

Under the lamplight, there is a particularly endearing feeling, the chirping of insects echoing from the corners of the stove and the holes in the wall, spreading a slight disturbance in the still darkness. When the beauty of poetic sentiment keeps me awake, I often long for the distant monastery.

Isolated from the cries of the marketplace, a person is cast into a forgotten corner. The awns of life entangle a person, and mountain mists veil the eyes. At night, I can hear the sound of waves. As I lean on the railing, countless boats often pass before me. There is no stimulation to excite me. I am captivated by the Ghost Festival, obscuring the awns and thorns of life. I forget that beyond the monastery, there is a home, my camel's burden. Oh, three days of time are spent at a monastery on a mountain in the middle of the river. It is a slightly cold, early autumn Ghost Festival. The sky, where the clouds are about to freeze, hangs a waterfall. The cold mist freezes the railings, making them slippery and lovely. Nearing the end of the Yoga Flame Mouth ritual, the wooden fish and cymbals are struck more and more rapidly, and the monks' voices are almost hoarse.

We sit in a pavilion facing the river, several black shadows immersed in the cold darkness of the night. The lotus lanterns light up and blink for a moment, then sink back into the water. The blazing light becomes dim, overturned by a wave, rising for a moment before extinguishing completely. I say with a touch of sadness:

"Isn't life also like these waves? With curves, with ups and downs?"

Distant mountains, a continuous stretch mixed with the shadows of clear cloud skies, interspersed with sparse city lights further away.

In retrospect, this was an extremely meaningful Ghost Festival, the whole family gathered on a mountain, in a monastery full of autumnal atmosphere, passing a few autumn evenings. Three days is a short time, yet it carries a heavy dream. I do not simply love stillness, liking to wrap the vitality of my heart in a decadent cassock. I simply love having a few days of leisure, whiling away the early autumn days, at the monastery, on the sparse mountain, on the clear, refreshing river. This is considered a kind of entertainment, a change of life.

The changes of human affairs are like the wind and sand on the ground, blown into countless gatherings and dispersals. When we left the old house in Jiangnan, the family who used to sit in the tall pavilion by the river were all cramped in a boat. The boat passed the mountain where we watched the moon on the Ghost Festival night, passed the vermilion-lacquered pavilion, where we could see the white stone railings, and also the winding corridors and verandas, the yellow walls hidden in the trees, and the gradually decaying willows.

Living in a low, damp, watery small town, I long for mountains, I love monasteries, because they are on mountains, and they also dot a mountain. Sailing through the Ghost Festival month, the dream of the monastery, heavy, heavy, I long for: the magnificent rivers and mountains, the sky will always be ours, ours…

Finally, one day, autumn slipped away from anticipation. I received news of the monastery. On a lonely afternoon, the sun weakly covered a desolate river outside the north gate. A row of trees in the distance seemed a little blurred. A thin monk stood on the bank, watching the fragmented shadows reflected on the water gate fence, the fish-scale-like glittering waves.

I approached him, and the monk began to talk to me.

"Are you also from Jiangnan?"

I nodded. He then told me that he had escaped from a famous monastery. The monastery was on a mountain in the middle of the river. Nothing was more beautiful than the Ghost Festival moon. The mountain was full of autumnal atmosphere, he loved the autumn in the mountains, the sparseness of the autumn, the sparse monastery.

Ah, the mountain in the middle of the river… Three years ago, maybe four years ago, a pile of past events in the dust. A gust of wind blew the "past" far away, a section of flavorful sugarcane squeezed extremely flat, extremely flat, without a trace of aftertaste. He told me of the destruction of the monastery, the slaughter of the monks, the island in the middle of the river, the mountain with weeping willows by the winding shore, the mountain with the outstretched wings of eagles, the famous spring in the long corridor plain, all the calamities of the monastery: turned to ash, turned to rubble, turned to desolate wilderness. When talking about the cruel slaughter, he used gestures to aid his words. He recited the names of friends one by one, little by little blood, drop by drop tear, "section by section heartbreaking stories. Finally, he rolled up his sleeves and said:

"People see this as my scar."

He explained the history of this great scar - a tragic and moving heroic story, the resistance of a group of monks in distress. In the thin, setting sun, the yellow cassock drifted with a few pieces of falling evening wind. The black shadows on the river grew darker, darker.

Not necessarily loving dry Zen, yet I love mountains. The autumn of the mountains, the sparseness of the autumn, the sparse monastery. The dream of the monastery is shattered, many places of mountains, on the river, on the plain, in the deep valleys...

I think of the monks on those monasteries, on that bird island in the middle of the river, the resisting martyrs. Some whose whereabouts have been unknown for a long time, are they alive? Are they dead? ...

It's autumn again, and soon it will be late autumn... Sparse forests, high and refreshing open country, asymmetrical villages, changing white snow... In the distant homeland, do they still exist? ... Life is too biased towards the times, and a little sparseness is needed. Autumn belongs to autumn, autumn belongs to monasteries. ...

So I am dragging a pile of monastery dreams, drifting in the sea of people.

### Random Jottings on an Autumn Night

— Ying

The forest obscures the sunlight.

Inside the forest, it is full of shadows, shadows gather from all directions, as if afraid the lumberjack will escape.

The lumberjack, however, would not think of escaping. He chops even harder at that thick tree trunk, one axe blow following another, never stopping.

On his forehead, the veins are throbbing, like earthworms wriggling. Sweat drips from his neck, through his bare back, into the waistband of his trousers, then out the bottom of his trouser legs, flowing straight down the back of his leg to the grass.

The grass is soaked. A damp circle encircles the lumberjack. The lumberjack, like steel, does not even shift his position.

The axe has become dull. The lumberjack exerts even greater force.

Finally, a large tree falls. A patch of shadow escapes. Sunlight shines directly down, kissing the damp circle of grass. - This grass, soaked with the lumberjack's sweat.

The grass gradually dries.

The lumberjack moves to another position, in the huge shadow, chopping at another large tree!

### Road Workers

"Let's open up a national lifeline on the land of our motherland!" The road workers bear this great mission.

It is a torrent of steel, winding through the wilderness, roaring a brave song: "Hang yo ai, hang yo ai!"

The epic of Asia's revival! The great artery of the Earth,冲激一切腐壞殘

The sun bakes down. Sweat flows.

The earth throbs, throbs, gaining eternal life. The great nation will endure with it!

Iron hoes, plows, ... flying up and down, intimately kissing the clods of earth and stones, stirring up the active mud and earth. Stones radiate out, like a waterfall騰於深谷裹, shooting stars trailing across space. The roller is pulled forward, the road gradually flattened.

"Hang yo ... yo ... yo haha ... ai" The mingling of human nature and steel, is a symbol of the power of the universe.

Ahead, a steep cliff suddenly appears, a greater obstacle.

Before long, a cannon is set up.

"Boom! - Crash ..." The cliff suddenly collapses.

The road workers leap on the lifeline of the nation, the heavy work begins again.

### Musings on a Moonlit Night

— Da Fen

Moonlight streams through the window, pouring in lightly, it is a beautiful night that makes one feel lost! The alluring moonlight makes one restless. Is not a dark night, where one cannot see one's fingers, more suitable for rest? If the night is a time for sleep, is the moon really a superfluous existence?

The colorful brush of the soul paints the white paper of imagination: a clear wind and bright moon night. On the beach, under the forest, a lonely young man holds a violin, his dreamy eyes gazing wistfully at the clouds, playing out memories and longing. Golden little flowers sparkle at the ancient ferry crossing of memory; reality, however, is gray and bleak.

I also want to use a sorrowful pen to paint a picture of a moonlit battlefield: a foreign country, a desolate wilderness, a cold and silent moon, a lonely warhorse, a lonely soldier. A sigh is accompanied by a string of tears. I want to title it "The Last Road."

I also remember myself and the times.

I would be saddened by the fate of flowers in a greenhouse; but even more tragic is that I myself am also a person as fragile as a flower, unable to withstand the wind, unable to withstand the rain. Nowadays, it is an era of wind and rain, and there is no need to close your eyes and be a fortune-telling blind man; who cannot make a prediction about the future position of flowers: they will wither quickly.

Smell the scent of this earth, how much blood has been shed upon it? I opened the window and felt a little cold. The sky is pressing down low, with dark clouds flowing by. Tonight, there should be a great storm coming, to the suburbs or the distance.

I long for lightning and thunder. This place is dark and suffocating. The hearts of the people need the nourishment of heavy rain!

### The Joys and Sorrows of Film Stars

— Xu Xiaoge

In this world, where there is separation, there must be reunion. On the one hand, there are many estranged couples who separate, while on the other hand, many new lovers are born. Some fall in love at first sight and become a loving couple, while others experience unexpected obstacles and separate like swallows and larks. Separation and reunion, reunion and separation, truly it is "how many separations and reunions in the art world, how many families rejoice and how many grieve?"

In the Chinese film industry, the earliest love affairs were considered to be the two major cases of Hu Die abandoning Lin Xuehuai and Ruan Lingyu breaking off with Zhang Damin, etc., and the three who committed suicide because of love are Mao Jianpei, Ai Xia, and Ruan Lingyu.

Now, following the news of Lan Ping's marriage, there are many others: the sad separations such as Gao Zhanfei abandoning Gao Qianping, Tan Ying breaking off with Cheng Bugao, Lu Luming abandoning Xu Xingzhi, Li Zhuozhuo leaving Zhang Yi, Xue Lingxian leaving Yan Zhexi, and Hu Jia separating from Chen Hongguang, constantly these many unfortunate news are coming. Most recently, there is also the news of An E leaving Ren Guang.

The above are heartbreaking separations. Now I will talk about the beautiful and joyful reunions: Among them, like Li Mingjian's high marriage with Guo Moruo, Li Lili marrying Luo Jingyu, Bai Yang's passionate love with Gao Zhanfei, Yu Peishan following Wang Weiyi. Besides, Kang Jian, Hu Jia, etc., also found heroic husbands in the war zone. There is also the villainous young actor Wang Xianzhai, who has always been a doctrinaire gentleman who embraces celibacy, but after running to the rear, he brought back a beautiful and jade-like wife. There is also Zhang Yi, who lost Li Zhuozhuo, but won the favor of the "temptress" Li Li. These are all stories of joys and sorrows on the silver screen.

Among the film actors who got married before the war, there are also many who have been able to maintain their marital relationship after the war, such as Hu Die and Pan Yousheng, Jin Yan and Wang Renmei, Chen Yanyan and Huang Shaofen, Li Minghui and Lu Dunen, Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua, Bai Hong and Li Jinguang, Chen Kengran and Xu Qinfang, Xu Xinfu and Yuan Meijun, Gong Qiuxia and Hu Xinling, Zhao Dan and Ye Luxi, Zhang Shankun and Tong Yuejuan, Cang Yinqiu and Wang Shouqiong ... etc., they can all live in peace and maintain the level of their love. These are outstanding couples in the art world, and I hope they can all "have a happy marriage for a hundred years, and grow old together."

### Ten Thousand People Compete to See a Red Pearl! (Part 2) Tongzhai Yuyi Records Song Dezhu's Long-Awaited Debut

— Tongzhai Yuyi

After graduating, she received careful instruction and guidance from the old court performer Wang Yaoqing, famous actors Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, Shang Xiaoyun, etc., and each gave her precious and rare unique scripts, all of whom believed that Dezhu was talented and intelligent, and could be regarded as an unprecedented rising star in the world! For example, Mr. Wang Yaoqing has the title of Tongtian Master in the modern Peking opera world. The four famous Dan actresses, Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, are the harvest of his most successful "peach and plum disciples." However, now that he is old, with gray hair, he does not personally teach ordinary disciples, but Cheng Yuqing takes care of everything. Only Dezhu is the most specially promoted by him. Every time she comes to visit, Mr. Yaoqing always personally instructs her on singing, arranging postures, and explaining the plot. The gift of scripts such as Zhonglie Yuanyang is an even rarer honor for "one person only."

Due to the increasing sweetness and brightness of her voice, as well as the delicacy and consideration of her expressions, and the beauty and moving nature of her stage presence, Dezhu has independently formed a troupe in this year and has become a performer who sings both martial and flowered roles. The new scripts are gradually increasing, and her own unique ones include Yang Paifeng, Princess Pingyang, Tianxiang Qingjie, Zhonglie Yuanyang, the entire Liang Hongyu, the entire Chi Fushou, Yushi Zhui Xiaotian Tai, etc., which will be staged one after another in Shanghai this time. Recently, Mr. Wu Huansun specially wrote a famous play for her that criticizes fallen women and promotes improvement and awakening, "Xunyang Dream," and also the new patriotic and chivalrous play "Shun Tianshi," which I specially requested Mr. Wu to write for Dezhu today, may also be staged in Shanghai. In addition, the entire Yutangchun, the entire Silang Visits His Mother, Farewell My Concubine and other plays, although not Dezhu's private scripts, are also her masterpieces. As for the unique new and amazing fights and moves of the martial roles, the American MGM film company once shot a newsreel of Dezhu's "Water Flooding Jinshan Temple." Even foreign people are so deeply impressed, how can one blame people for saying that all of Jiuzhenfeng's skills have been passed on to Song Dezhu, who is not named Guan, just like Tan Xinpei's advantages have been passed on to Jin Shuyan, who is not named Tan?

If I want to say some southern slang now, then Yang Shisen's Lao Sheng and Wu Yanchong's martial Sheng plays are also not to be missed. Baosen has come to Shanghai many times, and his reputation is growing, and he can justifiably be called the eight characters of Yu school authentic rhyme is completely unique. I have two friends, one is Mr. Li Zhaowen of Shanghai Bank, and the other is Mr. Lu Yizhong of Shanghai University, both of whom are knowledgeable in drama. They once said publicly that they would rather listen to Yang Maisen than to Tan Fuying. Although this is their personal preference, it can also be seen that Maisen's art is truly valuable. As for Yanchong, he is the son of the late famous Qingyi Wu Caixia, specializing in Yang school martial Sheng plays, with a grand atmosphere, solid martial skills, and a loud voice, all above Gao Shenglin who came to Shanghai last time. As for the heroic and handsome appearance, Shenglin cannot compare to him. He came to Shanghai once in his childhood (twenty years ago) and was welcomed by the Shanghai audience at that time. Now that he is back, everything is only more advanced than twenty years ago, and the even greater welcome he will receive is self-evident.

New Movie Introduction

### Rose of Washington Square

— Qi Hua

In "Rose of Washington Square," which is threaded together by singing and a love triangle, the director at least needs to melt the two together. Al Jolson's singing voice was not valued at first; Al Jolson after Rose left indeed became an overnight sensation after going on stage; and Alice Faye's singing on stage after Tyrone Power fled; in these three very important scenes, the director failed to use the characteristics of singing to strengthen the psychological state of these three characters. Thus, singing became an appendage of "Rose of Washington Square," or rather, the story of "Rose of Washington Square" was put together for these two singing talents (Al Jolson and Alice Faye).

Secondly, the director's skill in handling this story is also very poor. For example, the relationship between Al Jolson and Alice Faye is written too vaguely, so that Al Jolson sees Alice Faye falling in love with Tyrone Power and worries about it; Alice Faye tries her best to persuade Al Jolson and Tyrone Power to reconcile; Alice Faye pleads with Al Jolson to use his family fortune to bail out Tyrone Power, etc., all these scenes are plain and weak. As for the relationship between Tyrone Power and Alice Faye, there is no deep description, and because of the horizontal development, the tragic atmosphere is completely diluted.

Moreover, Tyrone Power's character is not clear. At first, he fell in love with Alice Faye at first sight. The detective discovered that he stole a pearl necklace; he worked as a guide in a gambling den; he owed loans to gangsters and sold his friend's furniture; he was arrested when a counterfeit money machine was cracked; and in the end, he surrendered himself. He failed to grasp the emotional fluctuations each time an incident occurred. Al Jolson is also just a singing actor, and he is not capable of playing such an important role.

### Wu Jilan Appointed Professor

— Qiuyan

The famous female actor Ms. Wu Jilan, from a family of high officials, has a forthright personality and a masculine spirit. She is the most praised adopted daughter of the late famous scholar Lin Wushan. She has served as a teacher, shopkeeper, and bank secretary. Her talent is outstanding, and her knowledge covers both Chinese and Western cultures. Her poems, calligraphy, and paintings are superb, and her iron pen is clear and transcendent, which is indeed extraordinary. Last year, Ms. Wu traveled far to Yunnan and returned with praise this spring. She immediately stopped singing and strumming on the red carpet and began teaching students calligraphy and painting at home for her own enjoyment. Recently, it was heard that Ms. Wu had been quiet for a long time and wanted to move again. In addition to founding the Aimeilan Embroidery Company, she also accepted the position of teacher at the Shanghai Dazhong Women's Night School. Because the school is of an obligation nature, with the purpose of helping out-of-school women, and the principal is also her friend, Ms. Wu generously took on the obligation of a teacher. The talented woman sings the old tune again, and the chalk dust flies again, which is truly a good story in both the education and Peking opera circles.

Dance World Sketches

### Sixth Star Record, Chapter Twelve: Wang Xiuqiong

One day, I went to Dahua and saw a friend sitting alone at a table, with a younger woman sitting beside him, a charming middle-aged woman, elegant and pleasant. My friend beckoned me to sit down and asked the woman to accompany me in dancing. I tried dancing with her, and her figure was light and graceful, only comparable to Jin Lili. I asked her name, and she said it was Wang Xiuqiong. A few days later, my friend invited me to drink again, taking Xiuqiong along. By the splendor of the electric light, I could see her appearance. Xiuqiong has a pretty and dignified face. She is generous in her demeanor. That day she wore plain clothes, inserted a white flower, and ate vegetarian food. I asked if she was eating Guanyin vegetarian or Lei Zhai vegetarian; she said, it was a seven-day vegetarian diet. She had eaten seven seven forty-nine days. I asked what the real meaning of the seven precepts was, and she smiled and did not answer. The vegetarian dishes arrived, and Xiuqiong picked up her chopsticks and offered them to me. I was reminded of an old couplet: "Eating generation eats vegetarian, eating vegetarian does not eat Dong" "Sick shit pisses shit, pisses shit does not poop shit," although it is comical, it is quite well-written. I recorded it to bring a smile.

After observing the dancing girls' figures and studying them carefully, I found that everyone is different. Generally, they can be divided into two factions: quiet and lively. The quiet faction is mostly over twenty years old, and they have more experience in the world, so their responses and interactions are all regulated, and they can always make people happy. However, they have also tasted all flavors, so they tend to be taciturn, and it is rare to hear about their lives unless you are deeply acquainted with them. Miss Wang is probably of this type.

In dance hall slang, insincere praise and feigned diligence are called rice soup. Those who hear it are confused by their words and repay them with sincerity, which is called drinking rice soup, meaning that they have been bewitched by them. Recently, not only do people know this meaning, but there are also those who pour rice soup on the dancing girls. Therefore, there are also dancing girls who drink the rice soup of the guests and go astray. However, those who know know, those who pour pour, those who drink drink, those who are confused are confused, and those who are confused often think that they are not confused, and those who pour confusing soup also often pour it on others. Intertwined and complex, both sides deceive each other. It is better to treat each other with sincerity, which can gain the other party's sympathy. However, when someone offers me rice soup, wanting to flatter me, and goes so far as to spare no words or expressions to please me, their feelings are also worthy of pity.

The other day, the Metropolitan held a standard dance competition, and Xiuqiong won first place, making her famous in the dance world. Her career is at its peak. She dances at the Dahua in the afternoon and at the Metropolitan in the evening. I combine these records to inform those who want to inquire.

### Rare News from the Great Flood in Tianjin and Tanggu: Red Dance Star Li Lingling Comes to Shanghai Alone

The heavens have unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have sudden fortunes and misfortunes. Miss Li Lingling is one of the unfortunate ones. When she was studying in Tianjin, she had loving parents above her and dear siblings below her. Her family was happy and harmonious. But how long did it last before her parents passed away one after another? This unfortunate orphan, bearing the heavy responsibility of educating her siblings, was forced to step onto the dance floor, which is the only way out for women. As a small family maiden, she naturally felt bored with this kind of life, but something happened that exceeded expectations. This woman, once she debuted, actually caused a sensation. It seemed that heaven intentionally pitied this orphan without parents and secretly protected her in the dark. From then on, her business grew day by day, and the capital regarded her as a treasure. From then on, Lingling enjoyed the benefit of a monthly income of more than a thousand yuan. For two years, her reputation spread throughout Tianjin and Tanggu. When Li Lingling's name was mentioned, it could be said that everyone knew her. In others, this kind of prosperity is most likely to lead to a dissolute path, but she is self-respecting. During the day, her clothes are simple, and she always dresses like a female student. On the one hand, she strives to provide for her siblings to study, and on the other hand, she tries to save her surplus capital. She likes swimming, and her body is healthy and her skin is often dark. Looking at her tamely, one does not feel her beauty. She is the opposite of those who can be viewed from a distance but not admired. Once you talk to her, her innocence is revealed, and her every frown and smile are childish and endearing. She is particularly good at talking, often talking for one or two hours without stopping. She is humble and polite in dealing with people. In Tianjin, she has infatuated countless people. Unexpectedly, good times do not last long. With a loud shock, her beautiful home turned into a swamp. This once famous Lingling had no choice but to temporarily leave her weak siblings and find another way out on the isolated island. Because Shanghai is a place where people from all directions gather and where good and bad are mixed, and the customs are not as sincere and simple as those of Tianjin, she was half suspicious and half fearful, and she could hardly decide. Finally, she visited the Paramount and felt that everything in it was still satisfactory, so she resolutely signed a contract with it. However, because she was unfamiliar with the place, she was always worried about her business prospects. Lingling's ancestral home is Panyu, Guangdong, she grew up in Shanghai and studied in Tianjin, so she speaks both Tianjin and Shanghai dialects fluently. At first, no one expected that this lively and lovely Northern Rouge would be a beautiful woman from the South.

### Anecdotes from the Opera World

— Xu Huayun

Being Clever Only Creates a Laughingstock

The play "Thirteen Sisters" has been very popular recently. However, the performances by Xun Huisheng and others all respect Wang Yaoqing's school of not using stilts, while the school of Yu Yuqin, who used stilts in those years, has disappeared from the red stage. In fact, strictly speaking, He Yufeng and her daughter were originally Han Chinese. Moreover, according to the usual practice in operas, except for Qingyi (virtuous women) and Daomadan (female warrior), who do not use stilts, all Huadan (female clowns) and Wudan (female martial artists) must use stilts. Therefore, the old school of using stilts has considerable justification. Furthermore, even if the Yu and Wang schools each have their reasons, He Yufeng having bound feet is probably beyond doubt. Also, when Thirteen Sisters is worshiping her mother and the knife at Qingyun Mountain, she will repeatedly call out "Precious sword!" and say, "Since the precious sword fell into my hands, I have never wantonly killed anyone..." We can also know that Thirteen Sisters not only has bound feet, but also the sword she never leaves her side is a precious sword that kills without drawing blood. I will solve the problems of "feet" and "sword" first; then, we can reflect on the fact that a certain famous actor's being clever is a very unreasonable performance. As for those who blindly cheered and shouted at the time, they probably lacked even basic common sense.

After Thirteen Sisters kills the evil monk at Nengren Temple, a certain actor has a particularly delicate expression. First, he points the blade of the precious sword downwards and shakes it repeatedly, indicating that a lot of blood is dripping from the sword that has just killed someone. This is not surprising enough. Finally, he lifts one foot and uses the sword to repeatedly rub and grind the sole of his shoe (actually, it should be a boot, because the actor was wearing flowered female boots that day) for several weeks. Only then does he consider the work of killing to be finished. The actor's delicate performance has been fully displayed before the eyes of the audience. In fact, he didn't think about it. In how many martial plays have countless people been killed? It's all over after the killing. Unless, like Song Jiang in "Sitting in the Tower" killing Yan Poxi, there might be traces of blood on the knife that could be discovered, so it seems okay to wipe it once. However, since Third Master Song is prepared to surrender himself, he doesn't need to be afraid or wipe it. (106)
