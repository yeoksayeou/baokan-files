Editorial

### Japan's Orchestration of Anti-Foreign Movements by Puppet Organizations

Japan has recently instigated a kind of anti-British, French, and American foreign exclusion movement in the occupied areas of China. In the past few days, various anti-British, French, and American leaflets and slogans in Chinese and Western languages have been found in Beijing and Shanghai. Various newspapers published by puppet organizations have also unanimously launched attacks on Britain and France. According to yesterday's Reuters telegraphic dispatch, this anti-foreign movement has already spread to other areas under Japanese military occupation--English goods in shops in Anqing have been searched and burned under the slogan of anti-foreignism. It is also rumored that the Japanese special service organization in Peiping has allocated 500,000 yuan as propaganda expenses for anti-British and American activities. The development of this disguised anti-foreign movement is indeed very worthy of international attention.

In the past 22 months of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has never given up on its efforts to exclude European and American forces in China. Why is it now launching a large-scale anti-British, French, and American movement? And why is it so obviously directing puppet organizations to carry it out? This active and intensified action to undermine European and American interests in China is only being carried out at this stage of the war. Naturally, there are several major reasons for this: First, Japan's 22 months of war against China have already exhausted its people and resources. Moreover, the recent active assistance to China by Britain, the United States, and other countries is sufficient to promote the situation that China "will surely win the war of resistance." Therefore, it wants to take advantage of the current tense situation in Europe to launch this anti-foreign movement to demonstrate against European and American democratic countries. On the one hand, it certainly wants to use this to intimidate various countries not to provide further assistance to China. At the same time, it also plans to use this method to force various countries to persuade China to surrender and seek peace, as a condition for stopping the anti-foreign movement.

Secondly, in order to reduce the criticism from various countries, Japan is instigating puppet organizations to carry out anti-foreign activities so that it can achieve practical results under the guise of the Chinese people. It can claim to the international community that the anti-European and American movement is only an expression of Chinese public opinion. In this way, all the protests from European and American countries caused by the past acts of destroying European and American industries in China, endangering the lives of their officials, expatriates, and residents, and blocking traffic on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, and prohibiting foreigners from operating and trading in the occupied areas, can be evaded. Now that it is destroying the rights and interests of European and American countries under the guise of the Chinese people, it can completely shift these responsibilities to the Chinese people, while the actual benefits are enjoyed by itself as the occupier. It knows that with the normal diplomatic relations between Britain, France, the United States, and the National Government of China remaining as friendly as ever, it will not establish diplomatic relations with puppet organizations, and naturally there will be no way to lodge a protest. In this way, unless Britain, the United States, and other countries decide to protect their rights and interests by force, Japan can very easily and skillfully complete its dream of a "New Order in East Asia."

In addition to the above two major reasons, Japan's attempt to use this to alienate the friendship between China and European and American countries is naturally also an important attempt. However, those with discernment in European and American countries know very well that the inside story of this trick is directed by Japan. Think about it, the Chinese people in the Japanese-occupied areas are only living under bayonets. Where else can there be any real expression of "public opinion"? If genuine public opinion could be expressed, why not oppose the violence that creates a bloody atmosphere, but instead exclude the irrelevant European and American forces? This shows that this trick of alienating the friendship between China and European and American countries is also shallow and boring, and who can be deceived by it?

As for wanting to use this to arouse the emotions of the general Chinese people against Britain, the United States, and other countries, the Chinese people live under bombing every day, and the distinction between "foe or friend" has long been proven by ironclad facts. There is no need for propaganda movements anymore. It seems that the anti-foreign movement implemented by Japan through puppet organizations is still mostly aimed at threatening the rights and interests of European and American countries in China and alienating the feelings between China and foreign countries. Although people in Britain, the United States, and other countries will never fall for Japan's conspiracy, there is one thing that is noteworthy: Japan's attempt to dominate the Far East is becoming increasingly clear because of this incident. The European and American democratic countries are currently conducting an anti-aggression front. How will they deal with Japan's anti-foreign movement that infringes on the rights and interests of various countries under the guise of the Chinese people with practical and effective methods?

Xiushui: The Chinese army besieging Wuning still occupies Chaping'ao, Yuanzhujian, and Maogouling, commanding a strategic height. The Japanese army is completely under the control of the Chinese army. Because of their repeated attempts to invade, they have not been successful. Therefore, yesterday they launched a counterattack against the Chinese army from Qilishanao, but they were still repelled. A small part of the Japanese army that attacked the left flank of the Chinese army was deeply infiltrated by adventure. They were cut off from the rear by a Chinese army raid and were unable to retreat. They were all annihilated, capturing two light machine guns, 21 rifles, and some military supplies. Most of them retreated to the Qilishanao area and were stalemated with the Chinese army. (Dispatch on the 26th)

(Chongqing): According to military sources here, the Chinese army continued to advance in northern Jiangxi Province yesterday, dividing its forces into two routes to counterattack Nanchang. The first route, after recapturing Gao'an, has advanced 30 kilometers, so it is now only 50 kilometers from Nanchang. The second route advanced towards Fengxin. As a result of the Japanese army's active reinforcements, fierce battles have broken out in Cunqianjie. Well-informed sources believe that the Jiangxi battle will enter a decisive stage recently. In addition, the Chinese army attacked Japanese positions 20 kilometers south of Nanchang along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and minor contacts also occurred. (Dispatch on the 26th)

Chinese Troops in Southern Hubei Arrive Outside Xianning

(Chongqing): According to today's report from the Chinese military, the Chinese army fighting in the Tongshan and Daban area of southeastern Hubei has advanced to the outskirts of Xianning on the Yuehan Road northeast of Tingsiqiao. Fierce battles have broken out in Tingsiqiao. In addition, powerful Chinese troops are now attacking south from Tongshan, attacking the Japanese army's fortifications south of the railway near the border of Hunan, Chongyang. It is said that fierce battles are taking place at Baini Bridge, 12 miles east of Chongyang. Since the Chinese army has recaptured Tongshan, Daban, Nanlinqiao, Baini Bridge, and other places, two-thirds of the Chongyang Yangxin Highway, which the Japanese army relied on as the transportation line in southern Hubei, has fallen into the hands of the Chinese army. It is said that the Chinese army is now trying to isolate the Chongyang army. At the same time, it is said that the Chinese guerrillas have attacked Zhifang on the Yuehan Road south of Wuchang. The Japanese garrison suffered 200 casualties, and several military supply depots were destroyed. According to the Chinese front-line report, in order to resist the Japanese army's counterattack on Gao'an, the Chinese army is now advancing to Fengxin in two routes, and is now only half a mile from the area. The Chinese guerrillas who retreated from Guling have joined the Chinese troops in Minshan. According to Chinese military experts, the Chinese army in Guling had no other way out and had to retreat. Fierce battles are currently taking place in Zhaopu, the Zhejiang port recently captured by the Chinese army. It is said that a large number of Japanese reinforcements are now planning to attack Zhaopu in four routes. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)

(Changsha): Since the Chinese troops in northern Jiangxi and southern Hubei have launched attacks using mobile tactics in recent days, they have all achieved amazing results. The Japanese troops who invaded the Jiangxi and Hubei borders have suffered unexpected blows, not only exhausted and unable to take care of each other, but also showing signs of shaking and collapse. In northern Jiangxi, the Chinese army has recaptured Gao'an and occupied Dachengtian, an important stronghold connecting the Xiang-Gan Highway via Tanxi, Anyi, and Fengxin, and wiped out the remaining Japanese troops between Gao'an and Dachengtian, as well as counterattacking Fengxin and Wuning, crushing the Japanese army's established plan to invade Changsha and Zhuzhou from this route, and further causing the Japanese forces to collapse. Nanchang was subsequently shaken. In southern Hubei, the Chinese army recaptured Tongshan, occupied Nanlinqiao and Daban, and approached Chongyang. The only bridge (i.e., the east-west Qian Highway section between Nanlinqiao and Xintanpu) on which the Japanese army relied to connect the Hubei-Jiangxi and Hunan-Hubei highways has been cut off. The Japanese army originally entrenched between Chongyang and Tongcheng has been driven out of the highway by the Chinese army and is gradually restricted to the area north of Yuezhou. Military observers believe that the Chinese army's consecutive victories in northern Jiangxi and southern Hubei have laid the foundation for the final victory. (Dispatch on the 26th)

(Chongqing): According to Chinese military news, there was not much change in the battle situation in southern Hubei Province yesterday. The Japanese army is now frequently mobilizing towards Tongshan, and the Chinese army is actively setting up defenses in the city to defend the important town of Wuchang-Changsha Highway. (Dispatch on the 26th)

(Chongqing): The Chinese army on the central China front advanced eastward from Tongshan and has reportedly recaptured Daban. The Chinese army is now continuing to advance towards Nanchang, and they are also attacking Fengxin and Jing'an. The Chinese army captured the above two locations and advanced eastward, thereby cutting off the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway, causing a major blow to the Japanese army's transportation line. A Chinese spokesman said that he believed that the Japanese side had concentrated its forces in Suiyuan Pinghan and other places, and once a war broke out in Europe, the above-mentioned areas would become the base for future wars, or could become the center for responding to demonstrations by certain European countries. However, assuming that war does not break out in Europe, the above-mentioned areas will take a defensive stance without attacking. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)

### The Chinese Army in Eastern Henan Attacked Kaifeng Three Times, Annihilating 2,000 Japanese Soldiers

(Luoyang): The Chinese army has launched three attacks on Kaifeng. Within ten days, it attacked the city twice, once entering the West Gate. The Chinese army's heroic spirit is worthy of praise and song. The circumstances of the three attacks on Kaifeng are summarized as follows: The first attack started at 12 PM on the night of the 10th. The Chinese army, with fewer than two battalions, attacked from the southwest and occupied the outer city first, then approached Caitun and the railway station. Although the Japanese army resisted desperately, it was difficult to stop the Chinese army's vigor. By dawn, the railway station and Caitun were occupied, and part of the Chinese army broke into the South Gate of the city, engaging in hand-to-hand street battles with the Japanese army, killing many of them. The Japanese ammunition depot was blown up, the warehouse was burned, and the water tower was destroyed. For a time, the fire illuminated the sky, floods spread everywhere, and the sound of explosions resounded through the clouds. This was a major gain for the Chinese army. The second attack was only one day later. Under the Japanese army's intensified defense, they re-entered Kaifeng on the morning of the 12th. This attack also involved only about 100 people. Everyone charged with the spirit of hand-to-hand combat. The Chinese army swept through the city for five hours, destroying many enemy and puppet agencies and killing many Japanese soldiers. When the remaining Japanese soldiers fled in large numbers, the Chinese army had safely returned to their defense positions. After the Chinese army's two attacks, the Japanese army was extremely panicked. Within a few days, they transferred more than 6,000 reinforcements from Xuzhou, which, added to the original number, was nearly 10,000. On the night of the 20th, the Chinese army launched a third attack. With only one battalion, they were able to break through the Japanese army's strict and solid defense, killing countless Japanese soldiers, re-occupying the railway station, and attacking the West Gate, setting fire to the Japanese and puppet agencies and treasuries. Their heroic and fearless spirit is worthy of national praise. In the above three attacks, a total of 2,000 Japanese soldiers were annihilated, causing great panic among the Japanese and puppets. Within a few days, important documents and items were moved one after another, and the puppet organization moved to Luowangdian. (Dispatch on the 25th)

### Where is Japan Heading Amidst the Changes in Europe?

(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph claims that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had planned to visit Berlin, but the departure date remains unknown. This is likely a sign that negotiations to transform the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance have broken down. According to sources in Rome, Ciano has canceled his plan to attend the German parliament and listen to Hitler's speech. Japan's hesitation stems from its naval authorities' apprehension about President Roosevelt's order to concentrate the American fleet in the Pacific. However, Hitler is reportedly making a final effort to change the Japanese government's attitude. Meanwhile, a dispatch from the Times in Tokyo states that the Japanese government is currently engaged in intense deliberation, uncertain of which course to take. Whatever encouraging words Hitler may utter in the German parliament on Friday, it cannot be said that Japan is willing to fight for the Axis powers in the Pacific. This situation, as well as the future of the Yonai cabinet, is now very delicate. (Reuters, 26th)

(Tokyo) An editorial in the Kokumin Shimbun states that, given Britain's expansion of aid to the Chinese government, which has been at war with Japan for twenty months, the development of hostility between Britain and Japan is now unavoidable. Japanese public opinion strongly supports concluding a military alliance to strengthen the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact. Now that Britain and France have allied with the Soviet Union and extended their joint policy to the Far East, restricting the activities of the pact's signatories to fighting communism is meaningless. Britain and America have already exerted significant economic pressure on Japan, and continuing to increase this pressure will not only harm themselves but also provoke war. To bring the expedition to China to a successful conclusion, Japan must, of course, conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy. If the government does not make a straightforward decision on this point, it will be subject to severe criticism for negligence. (Reuters, 26th)

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Explains the New Budget in the House of Commons, Huge Defense Expenditures, New Taxes to Compensate

(London) As Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon delivered his budget speech in the House of Commons today, he announced amidst cheers a national defense estimate of £630,000,000, stating that this vast sum reflects the scope and effort the government has undertaken, and also the nation's determination in this matter. The Chancellor detailed that last year's defense expenditures, funded from tax revenue, amounted to £254,500,000, while loans accounted for £128,000,000, thus the three defense departments collectively spent £382,500,000. Including food storage and air defense equipment, the total nearly reached the round figure of £400,000,000. Additional defense spending is the most serious and urgent issue and will be the main point of contention in this budget. The estimated expenditure for supply matters is £675,000,000, and the estimated expenditure for air defense is £42,000,000, of which £37,000,000 will be covered by loans. The estimated expenditure for food storage is £5,000,000. The total expenditure is all allocated from £922,000,000 in tax revenue; additional defense expenditures are not included. The Chancellor spoke of social affairs and domestic expenses, saying that new domestic projects requiring huge expenditures are impossible under the current circumstances. Based on the current tax base, the total estimated expenditure is £980,000,000, of which £223,000,000 can be allocated to this year's defense expenses. According to the original defense expenditure estimate, £230,000,000 was to come from tax revenue. However, this year's original defense expenditure figure was £580,000,000, of which £350,000,000 was to be covered by borrowing and £230,000,000 by tax revenue. Now, due to the tension in all aspects of national defense, the figure has increased to £630,000,000, and further increases are not impossible. The difference will not be fully covered by borrowing but will be compensated by new taxes, of which £24,000,000 will be allocated from tax revenue, so taxpayers must pay £942,000,000 in taxes. The remaining £380,000,000 will be raised through loans. The Chancellor then announced the abolition of the stamp duty on medicines, a reduction in entertainment tax for theaters, and the imposition of a tax on British-made films, estimated to generate £800,000 this year and £1,000,000 in a full year. Cheers erupted when the Chancellor announced that the standard rate of income tax would not be changed, but the cheers ceased when the Chancellor then announced that the motor vehicle horsepower tax would increase from ten shillings to twenty-five shillings per horsepower from January next year. The cheers were also silent when the Chancellor announced changes to surtaxes and inheritance taxes. The Chancellor said that for incomes within £8,000, a surtax of £5 per £100 would be levied, and for those exceeding £8,000, £10 would be levied. The tobacco tax will increase from two shillings to eleven shillings and sixpence per pound from tomorrow, and the sugar tax will increase by one farthing (one-fourth of a penny) per pound from today. The Chancellor stated that the death tax rate of 10% on estates of £5,000 or more would not be changed. Based on the new tax base, the total estimated tax revenue is £942,600,000. The Chancellor concluded by mentioning the defense estimate, saying that it would not be difficult to reach this figure with borrowing, but he believed it was inappropriate to adopt such a simple solution. If taxation is convenient and tolerable to raise funds, and if borrowing is flexible and able to raise funds, then borrowing is also limited. Since the national tax burden is already so heavy, the whole country should be aware of the need for continued sacrifice. In the long run, it would not be good for the country to take it lightly and rely entirely on borrowing for all increased national expenditures, so he proposed to levy new taxes totaling £24,000,000. Due to certain points arising from the commercial treaties concluded with the United States and India, legislation is needed. He will submit a resolution in the coming days to supplement certain provisions of the Anglo-American commercial treaty. As for the Anglo-Indian commercial treaty, he will include this new one within the framework of the Ottawa Agreements Act. The Chancellor also explained that the abolition of the stamp duty on medicines and the reduction of the tax on theater tickets by one penny each would result in a loss of tax revenue of £1,000,000 for the government. The government has strived to the best of its ability to encourage a plan of confidence in commerce. If there is no setback, commerce can be expected to continue to prosper, so he avoided all plans that would have an adverse impact on industry. The Chancellor's announcement of the increase in the motor vehicle tax greatly surprised the House of Commons, and members who owned cars were all discussing this matter. The Chancellor clarified the reason for increasing the sugar tax, saying that the current foreign raw sugar tax is equivalent to nine shillings and fourpence per 112 pounds. The imperial preferential tariff will be protected, and the domestic sugar consumption tax will be adjusted.

After the Chancellor announced the budget, opposition leader Attlee rose to speak, saying that the Chancellor's presentation did not genuinely address the issue of meeting this huge expenditure but was merely a stopgap measure. Sooner or later, the burden of borrowing would be borne by the poorest of the poor. We should impose new taxes on accumulated assets as soon as possible, instead of incurring large interest-bearing loans, the sooner the better.

Liberal leader Sinclair then stated that this budget was incomprehensible to ordinary people. He believed that if taxpayers could appreciate the government's painstaking efforts regarding expenditure, the goodwill and patriotism of the people mentioned by the Chancellor would be greatly enhanced. We must determine that the huge expenditure on armaments is currently subject to economic management, and at the same time, we must curb private spending, preventing it from competing with the nation's rearmament efforts in the use of luxury goods. While supporters of the government are now demanding the conscription of manpower, there is little evidence in the budget of implementing a decisive policy to mobilize the nation's economic and financial resources for the nation's effort.

### Chamberlain Announces in Parliament that Britain Has Decided to Implement Conscription; Britain Has Decided to Implement Conscription; Able-bodied Men Aged 20-21 to Receive Six Months of Training; Implementation Will Increase the Army by 310,000; Also Declares Readiness to Resume Negotiations with Germany

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that the government has decided to submit to Parliament the "Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill," to amend the procedures for the conscription of soldiers of all ranks and types in the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces, aiming to simplify them. It will also submit a Military Training Bill next week, under which all able-bodied men in the country aged between 20 and 21 will be required to enlist and receive military training for a period of six months, and then be incorporated into the reserve forces or auxiliary forces. After the implementation of this measure, 310,000 soldiers can be obtained. The recruitment of naval personnel and air defense forces will continue to be based on a voluntary system. In addition, the government will submit another bill in the near future to "limit the profits of factories that manufacture munitions for the government to complete the armament program." (Havas, 26th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain said today that the government, urged by various countries on the European continent with whom Britain has agreements, has decided to implement conscription and has informed labor leaders that the government will first conscript able-bodied men aged 20 to 21. They will first serve in the regular army for six months, after which they will be free to choose to transfer to the army reserve or the national defense volunteer force. The number of those to be conscripted will reach 200,000, with no distinction of rank. All, regardless of class, will receive the same training. Only those with medical reasons can be exempted. The government will immediately submit a bill to call up reserves and auxiliary forces of all ranks and types. This bill will be called the "Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill" and will simplify the procedures. The government will also submit a military training bill next week, authorizing the government to call up able-bodied men nationwide aged between 20 and 21 to receive six months of military training. Only in the event of war will they be obligated to serve overseas. After completing training, if they do not wish to join the national defense volunteer force, they will be transferred to the special reserve of the regular army. It will also stipulate that those who conscientiously object to military service may be exempted by the conscription tribunal, but only on the condition that they undertake work of significant importance to the country. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that the total number of those included in this conscription, excluding those actually exempted, is 310,000. (Reuters, 26th)

(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons the intention to implement conscription, opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee immediately asked, "The Prime Minister previously gave assurances that conscription would not be implemented in peacetime. Why has he gone back on his word?" Several opposition members shouted "Resign!" Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "The circumstances in which we find ourselves cannot be regarded as peacetime. I hope the people will think deeply and consider my words to be true." He then proposed that the issue be discussed tomorrow. (Havas, 26th)

(London) During a meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to an inquiry from a member that if the British government were convinced that negotiations with the German government would be welcomed by that country and would be fruitful, then the British government would be happy to do so. As for the international conference proposed by US President Roosevelt, although the British authorities have not received an invitation, they would welcome any initiative taken by the US and would be very willing to participate. (Havas, 26th)

(London) British Ambassador to Germany Sir Nevile Henderson notified the German Foreign Office today that the British government is determined to resist German aggression. The current implementation of compulsory military service is a clear sign of this determination, but this is not intended to encircle Germany. Britain is still willing to begin negotiations at any time regarding the various economic demands made by Germany. (Havas, 26th)

### Unions Still Oppose Conscription; Chamberlain Explains to Them

(London) After a one-hour cabinet meeting this morning, the General Secretary of the British Trade Union Congress was summoned by Chamberlain to No. 10 Downing Street to hear the government's views on the implementation of conscription. When the Prime Minister met with the union leaders, Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Minister of Labour Brown were present. (Reuters, 26th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain met with representatives of the Trades Union Congress this morning and informed them of the government's decision to implement conscription. All young men in the country aged between 20 and 21, except those physically unfit, totaling more than 200,000, will be required to enlist and serve for a period of six months, after which they will either be assigned to the reserve forces or the auxiliary forces, according to their wishes. Regarding this matter, the representatives of the Trades Union Congress expressed frankly to Prime Minister Chamberlain that the implementation of conscription in peacetime is opposed by the Trades Union Congress, and the submission of a bill to Parliament at this time would be particularly difficult. (Havas, 26th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain met with representatives of the Trades Union Congress at 10 Downing Street this morning to discuss the issue of implementing conscription. The Prime Minister said, "Certain countries on the European continent are planning various defensive measures with our country and wish our country to implement conscription in some way, to maintain the necessary number of troops in readiness. The government has now drafted a plan in response to the requests of those countries. All young men in the country aged between 20 and 21 will be required to enlist. Based on the population survey of 1931, the number of those to be conscripted will be 272,000." Sir Walter Citrine, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Trades Union Congress, immediately replied that the Prime Minister had announced to the House of Commons on March 29 that conscription would not be implemented in peacetime. At that time, the Trades Union Congress, recognizing the importance of national defense issues, assisted the government in implementing the National Voluntary Service Scheme based on this promise. Unexpectedly, the Prime Minister has now gone back on his word. Although compulsory military service has its limits, it is sufficient to harm the national economy, and once implemented, it will have adverse effects. This point should be noted. Also, the government plans to limit those to be called up for service to young people aged 20 to 21. It is not known on what basis this standard was set. In the view of the Trades Union Congress, if conscription is indeed necessary, then all of the nation's resources, including wealth and various means of production, should be conscripted. In summary, conscription is still opposed by the Executive Committee of the Trades Union Congress, and they will hold another meeting this afternoon to study the government's proposal. In addition, the Labour Party Executive Committee and the Labour Party Parliamentary Group are scheduled to meet separately this afternoon to discuss the issue of conscription. The National Executive Committee of the Labour Movement (i.e., the Executive Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party Executive Committee, and the Labour Party Parliamentary Group) is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning, at which time a firm decision will be made. (Havas, 26th)

### Britain Implements Conscription; Germany Says It's Irrelevant; Italy Says It's Politically Significant; French Press Says It Will Restore Confidence

(Berlin) The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung writes that regarding the British and French newspapers' claim that Britain's implementation of conscription is enough to warn Germany, people here have no impression whatsoever. If Britain's move is truly intended to give Germany the impression of a "threat warning," then we dare to say that it is a big mistake, because Germany will never be surprised by any decision, warning, or threat from Britain, nor will it change its national policy. Regarding the return of the British and French ambassadors to Germany, people here are taking a reserved attitude. The so-called speech to be given by Hitler on the 28th of this month, if it cannot satisfy the Western democracies, then Britain and France will take necessary measures to maintain European tranquility, people here believe that Germany should also be prepared to prevent unforeseen events, and take the same measures as Britain, implementing conscription. (Haitong, 26th)

(Rome) Regarding the issue of Britain's implementation of conscription, people here originally thought that the British government's attitude was hesitant and might not act hastily. Now, upon hearing of the decision to implement it, everyone is deeply impressed. Political figures believe that this is a concession by Britain to France, because technically speaking, new recruits who have only been trained for a few months are not enough to become an elite force. However, politically speaking, the significance is very great, because Britain's war potential has increased as a result, and the evolution of the European situation will naturally be shifted by it. (Havas, 26th)

(Rome) The Roman newspapers today published the news of the British decision to adopt compulsory military service without criticism. People here consider this a major attempt to intimidate Germany and express doubts about the ability to train a force capable of using modern weapons in a matter of months. People still generally believe that Britain has not yet become an army country. (Reuters, 26th)

(Paris) The French newspapers today unanimously welcomed Britain's adoption of conscription, saying that Britain's efforts will make the dictatorships realize that war is unwise. Le Journal claims that Australia and South Africa will follow Britain's plan. During the European War, Australia and South Africa sent strong armies to France to help in the war. Le Petit Parisien claims that Poland, Romania, and Greece will recognize Britain's decision as a very logical move to supplement their promises to aid invaded countries, and the Soviet Union and Turkey will accelerate negotiations to create an Eastern European defense line. Le Journal de Paris claims that if Britain could have sent its troops, which it had at the end of last year, to Europe on the first day of the Great War, the plans of the Central European countries would have been broken, and the advantage of the future would have been on the side of the Western European powers and their allies. (Reuters, 26th)

(Paris) After the British Cabinet decided to implement conscription, the newspapers here unanimously praised it. Le Petit Parisien reported, "This move has not only made a profound impression in France, but it will also shock countries around the world. Certain plans of those dictatorships will soon come to naught because of this." Le Journal reported that Western European countries and their allies have now truly gained an advantage." L'Écho de Paris reported that after Britain implements conscription, the Commonwealth of Australia and the Union of South Africa will certainly follow suit. Le Petit Journal reported, "The Germans only respect strength. We are now also preparing to demonstrate a kind of strength so that the world knows that we also have the function of using strength." Le Temps reported, "The stronger and more courageous Britain and France are, or the more allies they have, the further war will be." L'Intransigeant reported, "Only by facing each other with strength can the all-powerful countries realize." Le Peuple reported, "The current crisis has been seen by the British diplomatic authorities, and they are working hard to make other countries aware of it. If the country had hesitated further on the implementation of conscription, it would have created a bad impression, giving the impression that Britain does not have sufficient spirit of sacrifice to effectively cope with this crisis. The government's decisive action is now imperative and brooks no delay." (Havas, 26th)

### British Press Emphasizes

(London) After the government decided to implement conscription, "The Evening Standard" commented, "Those of the nation who can understand the truth of the situation will certainly accept this natural obligation with pleasure. Those who hold dissenting views are only a few laggards. In short, Britain currently has 19 divisions of regular troops, and in the event of war, they will certainly feel that they are insufficient. After the implementation of conscription, the addition of 13 divisions will provide a sense of security." (Havas, 26th)

### Romanian Foreign Minister Does Not Believe War Is Inevitable; Not Seduced by Talks with Germany

(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu told the diplomatic correspondent of the News Chronicle, Bartlett, that he does not believe that war is inevitable and that a common way to discuss peace can eventually be found. Bartlett published an article in the News Chronicle, saying that in recent months, Gafencu is probably the first among foreign diplomatic officials who have visited Berlin and have not been seduced into signing any documents that restrict their national independence. It is hoped that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković, who is currently visiting Berlin, and Gafencu, as the backbone of the Balkan Pact and the Little Entente, will not forget Gafencu's admirable example. (Reuters, 26th)

Hitler Receives Yugoslavian Foreign Minister

(Berlin) The Yugoslavian Foreign Minister, Mr. Marković, arrived here at 5:15 PM today after holding talks with the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Ciano. He was greeted at the airport by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and they held lengthy talks at the Foreign Ministry at 6:30 PM. According to semi-official sources, both sides completely agreed on all outstanding issues. (Havas, 25th)

(Berlin) Chancellor Hitler received the Yugoslavian Foreign Minister, Mr. Marković, at noon today for talks. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. A communiqué issued afterward stated only that the talks were lengthy, without further details. (Havas, 26th)

(Berlin) Negotiations between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Yugoslavian Foreign Minister Marković have been very harmonious. Last night, Ribbentrop hosted a banquet at the Esplanade Hotel to welcome Marković, who, as the Yugoslavian ambassador to Germany in Berlin, had strived to promote friendship between Germany and Yugoslavia. These negotiations have further strengthened relations between the two countries, and political, economic, and cultural cooperation will be further advanced in the future. Marković responded that the purpose of these negotiations could be summed up in one sentence: to enhance cooperation between the two countries for the welfare of their peoples. (Haitong, 26th)

(Berlin) A Berlin local newspaper published an article yesterday welcoming the Yugoslavian Foreign Minister, Mr. Marković, stating that Germany's growing power must find an outlet to the southeast, and that Yugoslavia's construction work requires Germany's economic and technical assistance. Therefore, good relations between Germany and Yugoslavia are based on mutually beneficial interests. Yugoslavia's refusal to join the group of Western powers has been met with satisfaction by both German and Yugoslavian authorities. (Haitong, 26th)

German Foreign Minister Does Not Meet with British Ambassador, Undersecretary Receives Instead

(Berlin) Undersecretary of State Weizsäcker received British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson at noon today. (Havas, 26th)

(Berlin) The meeting between the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, originally scheduled for yesterday, did not take place. According to responsible sources, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had other appointments and could not meet with the British Ambassador. As of last night, the date of a future meeting had not been decided. It is rumored that the British Ambassador has returned with a document for the German government, but German officials have strongly denied that the British Ambassador brought any such document. Their attitude is based on Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons that the Ambassador's return was merely a routine event after a holiday. The Hamburger Fremdenblatt commented on the matter, saying, "Judging from the tone of the British newspapers, London's eagerness to resume negotiations with Berlin far exceeds that of Germany." (Reuters, 26th)

Russo-Polish Relations Show Growing Closeness; Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Visits Bulgarian Prime Minister, Then Goes to Turkish Capital for Talks

Warsaw - A Foreign Ministry spokesman told newspapers that "[the] development of relations between Poland and the Soviet Union is deeply satisfying," and that it is particularly gratifying that Soviet authorities fully understand Poland's interests. Political circles here attach great importance to this statement, and the semi-official Polish Daily commented that Poland is willing to maintain peaceful relations with Germany, but since the issue of the Free City of Danzig arose, their views have diverged. It is important to know that "[the] Polish government cannot accept any unilateral actions that concern Poland's vital interests, nor can we tolerate the sacrifice of Poland's vital space to fulfill what they call Germany's vital space." In addition, the visit of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin to Turkey has also attracted the attention of the newspapers here. According to a Polish news agency, the Soviet Union plans to conclude a military alliance treaty with Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. (Havas, 26th)

Sofia - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin arrived here at 7:00 AM this morning and was greeted at the station by representatives of the Foreign Ministry. At noon, he met with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov. At 4:20 PM, he continued his journey to the Turkish capital. (Havas, 26th)

French Ambassador to Germany Returns to Berlin

(Paris) Following the return of British Ambassador Henderson to Germany yesterday, French Ambassador Coulondre also departed for Berlin at 7:15 PM today to return to his post. Responsible sources here have stated that it is a misunderstanding to believe that the return of the British and French Ambassadors to Germany indicates a relaxation of the policy of resisting aggression. In fact, the British government will implement conscription in the near future, and after the French government learned of this, it decided to send Ambassador Coulondre back to his post. All other speculations are incorrect. (Havas, 25th)

Sino-American Negotiations Continue Regarding Loans and Aircraft Purchases

(Washington) An official of the semi-official Export-Import Bank yesterday declined to confirm the exact amount of the recent $25 million loan to China, saying that announcing such figures would be contrary to policy. However, they reiterated that the loan could not be used to purchase aircraft, and that the loan was unrelated to the current negotiations between a Chinese group and American aircraft manufacturers. It is reported that silver worth approximately $1,300,000 was shipped from China to the United States last month, a significant increase compared to recent months. Financial circles believe that at this rate, China will be able to fully repay its $15,000,000 contract with the American aircraft manufacturer within ten months. Officials here have repeatedly denied that China used the US government loan to purchase aircraft from American manufacturers. The Chinese Embassy has also stated that it has no direct connection with this transaction. Sources said that the contract negotiations were conducted entirely by the American Minister to China, Mr. Peck, and the Chinese Finance Minister, Mr. Kong, in China. The above-mentioned contract involves China purchasing combat aircraft and aircraft parts worth $15,000,000 from the United States, totaling over 100 aircraft. Mr. Peck returned to the United States on the China Clipper last week and met with representatives of aircraft parts companies, including Mr. Niddleman, in Los Angeles. It has now been learned that Mr. Niddleman returned to New York at the end of last week, and the negotiations may conclude within a few days. (Associated Press, 26th)

New British Ambassador to the United States Advocates Anglo-American Cooperation

Even if the United States wants to adopt a policy of isolation, it is not allowed by reality. The fates of the two countries are closely linked. Lord Lothian also told an Associated Press reporter that "[the] United Kingdom and the United States are the greatest countries in the world, their relationship is the most important, and the unlimited authority of both countries is the bulwark of freedom and peace."

Chinese Troops in Suiyuan Recover Two Villages

Yulin - The villages of Shaerqin and Ergesun, located in the territory of Sa County, are in the middle of the Sui-Bao section of the Ping-Sui Railway and are important strongholds for Baotou.

Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation

Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission discussed the results achieved by the Chinese army on various fronts in the past week (April 20th to 26th), outlined as follows:

(1) Guangdong Front: The Japanese troops in Zengcheng once reached Futian Su and Jiaodong, but after fierce attacks by the Chinese army, they retreated. The remaining enemy forces in Conghua and Xinjie have been cleared. The Japanese troops in Xijiang are engaged with our forces near Guandu and Sanshui. After repeated attacks, the enemy has suffered heavy losses. Xinhui was recaptured this week, and enemy reinforcements have been repeatedly repelled. Jiangmen is also under intense siege. As a result, the periphery of Guangzhou has been completely breached by our forces, and the city is in a state of extreme disorder. Enemy officers and their families are evacuating, and large and small traitors are fleeing to Hong Kong in a panic. Our advance troops are now close to the urban area and have even entered it at times. The remaining enemy forces are in a state of utter panic.

(2) Hunan-Jiangxi Front: The enemy in northern Jiangxi, after invading and occupying Nanchang, has become a spent force. This week, our army recaptured Gao'an and Gaoqiao City and advanced to the vicinity of Wanshou Palace. On one side, we occupied Dachen and attacked Fengxin, making it impossible for the enemy troops on the southern bank of the Xiu River to stand their ground. They are now wavering. The enemy in Wuning is trapped in the city after our army recaptured Changlingang, Mao Gou Mountain, and Chaping Ridge. They cannot move. Near the Fu River, our army recaptured Shi Hankou, Xiliangshan, Chong'an, and Xiangtang, making it even more difficult for the enemy to cope. The enemy's attempts to invade Changsha in northern Hunan have been very active, but they have been dealt heavy blows by our attacking troops. Yuezhou is still under our siege. Another unit of our army suddenly launched an attack the day before yesterday, capturing the most important stronghold behind enemy lines in southern Hubei, the Tong-Nanlin Bridge, proving that the enemy's strength is exhausted.

(3) Shanxi Front: Last week, the enemy in Taigu, Qixian, and Pingyao attempted to launch a large-scale invasion of our eastern Shanxi. After days of fierce fighting, over 2,000 enemy soldiers were killed, and the remaining enemy forces fled south from Gucheng to Zhang Nan Zhen. Yesterday, they retreated further to Chizi Hong Zhen. Their attempt to invade the east has been completely shattered. The enemy in southern Shanxi has been in a completely passive state since their failed attack on the Zhongtiao Mountains. Our army launched separate attacks, besieging Yuncheng and Zhang Dian Zhen, attacking Jie County and Yongji City, and entering them several times. In the battle of Xia Dongnan Zhen, over 1,500 enemy soldiers were killed. At the same time, ambushes were set up everywhere, making every step taken by the enemy a thorn in their side. In particular, the ambush near the Fen River killed over 300 enemy soldiers from Huoxian Nan Jiao, in addition to those who fell into the Fen River, leaving the enemy terrified and in disarray. In northern Shanxi, our army advanced towards Jingle after recapturing Wuzhai. The county seat is now surrounded, and the remaining enemy forces will soon be annihilated.

(4) Henan Front: The Japanese army in Kaifeng has been extremely panicked since our army stormed the city twice last week. They have been actively sending reinforcements for days. This week, our army once again stormed to the area around the Western Railway Station, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. In their anger, they attacked Changyingji and Zhongmou, but were routed after a head-on attack by our forces. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, capturing a large number of prisoners and dividing their forces to attack Huaiyang, once storming into the Northern Gate and capturing many prisoners. The enemy in Xinyang has been repeatedly attempting to stir up trouble, but they have scattered and fled after a brave attack by our forces. The county seat is still tightly surrounded by our army, and the enemy forces inside the city cannot move and are eager to escape. In northern Henan, our army has been deploying mobile tactics, raiding Jia and Kui Qinyang and sweeping Bai Xiang Zhen, leaving the enemy in a state of constant fear. In addition, the enemy forces in western Suiyuan have been repeatedly defeated. The control of the Ping-Sui Railway, the recapture of Dong Zhaoyuan, the siege of Zhucheng, the brief entry into Nanle in southern Hebei, and the attacks on Tongxian have all left the enemy in a state of panic. The activities of our army in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have caused the enemy great suffering, including capturing Haimen in northern Jiangsu, besieging Rugao, attacking Lishui in southern Jiangsu, attacking Tianwang Temple, besieging Wukang in Zhejiang, forcing Wu Xing, recapturing Wuzhen, and attacking Hushi, Jing Jiang area. The number of enemy casualties is truly incalculable. (Telegram, 26th)

Japanese Troops in Guangzhou are Desperate, Deploying Forces to Rescue, Fierce Battles in Paitan Taipingchang, Japanese troops ambushed, suffering over a thousand casualties

Hong Kong News, after the Chinese army in Guangdong Province launched a counter-attack from the northeast and northwest, the Japanese army in Guangzhou is already stretched thin. Since the battles of Zengcheng and Xinjie, the main force of the Japanese army has suffered thousands of casualties. The commander of the Southern Branch of the Japanese Army, An Teng, has recently withdrawn troops from the areas around Huangpu and Xinhui to rescue Guangzhou. The Japanese troops returning to Guangzhou from Huangpu landed and went north along Shitan, joining the remnants of the Japanese army in the Zhucun and Shiqiao areas and attacking Zengcheng. On the 16th, the Japanese troops in Conghua Taipingchang, after being replenished, also gathered over 6,000 troops and went east, attacking the west of Zengcheng and advancing towards the Chinese army positions in Paitan. Paitan is located about seventy or eighty miles north of Zengcheng, supported by artillery and aircraft. The Chinese army in Paitan met the enemy head-on, and the fierce battle lasted all night. At the same time, the Chinese army that had entered Zengcheng also shifted its troops westward to encircle the Japanese troops attacking Paitan. The Japanese troops in Taipingchang were attacked from both sides and eventually could not hold on, retreating towards Shengang and other places. In this battle, another thousand or more people were killed and wounded.

The Struggle for Zengcheng

When the Chinese army attacked the Japanese troops in the Taipingchang area from Zengcheng, the troops left behind in Zengcheng were inevitably weakened. The Japanese army took the opportunity to gather reinforcements in Zhucun and other places and advanced north. For the sake of the overall situation, the Chinese army planned to first annihilate the main force of the Japanese army in the Taipingchang area and then deal with the Japanese army south of Zengcheng. Moreover, Zengcheng was damaged after the seesaw battle, so it was not suitable to hold firmly. Therefore, when the Japanese troops in Zhucun approached Zengcheng on the 17th, the Chinese army deployed on both wings, guarding the northeastern strongholds outside Zengcheng. The Chinese army still holds the Litchi Ao north of the city, mutually reinforcing with the Chinese army in Paitan. The area near Zhengguo is used as a retreat area to the east. The Japanese army re-entered Zengcheng on the 17th, but the Chinese guerrillas below Zengcheng were very active. Although the Japanese army penetrated deep into Zengcheng, their rear was suddenly cut off, and there was a danger of the entire army being wiped out.

The Clever Strategy of the Chinese Army

When the Japanese troops in Taipingchang attacked Paitan, they thought that a roundabout encirclement of the Chinese army in Zengcheng could achieve their annihilation plan. When the Japanese troops in Taipingchang went east, the Chinese army in Conghua and Huaxian launched fierce attacks on Taipingchang and Shengang, and the Japanese army quickly deployed a part of its troops to respond, stubbornly resisting in the Shekeng area. As of the morning of the 18th, they were still in a stalemate. A part of the Japanese army crossed the river in Shengang and advanced to Jiulianfen and Chailankeng. The Chinese army happened to arrive, and the Japanese army fled in a panic. Another part rushed out of Shiqian Market, but was again met by the Chinese army and failed. On the 19th, the Chinese army in Paitan and Huaxian took advantage of the situation to encircle the Japanese troops in Taipingchang. If the main force of the Japanese army in this area is defeated by the Chinese army, it will be as easy as turning one's hand to recover Guangzhou.

The Struggle of the Japanese Army

The Japanese army in Guangzhou knew that the situation was becoming increasingly urgent and was preparing a retreat route. Once the Chinese army in the east, west, and north launches a long drive straight down, the Japanese army in Guangzhou will be like a turtle in an urn. The remaining Japanese army has no other way to retreat except by water. Therefore, hundreds of transport ships have been gathered on the surface of the Pearl River in recent days, in preparation for emergencies. In order to prepare for covering the retreat of the remnants, Japanese troops in the rear have been deployed in recent days on the south bank of the Pearl River, from Henan in Guangzhou to Panyu and Shunde, setting up camps every step of the way, in order to contact the Japanese troops in Humen and attempt a final struggle. The Pearl River Delta (including Panyu, Shunde, Zhongshan, and other counties) is frequently adjacent to rivers and seas, and the Japanese army can use this as a retreat route. This is a cunning plan, but the area is a flat plain with no defenses to rely on. If the Chinese army conducts a sweeping aerial bombardment with a large number of aircraft and the Japanese aircraft are unable to respond, then the area that the Japanese army considers to be a safe retreat will become a collective burial ground. In short, if Guangzhou is not defended, then the barrier of the Japanese army in the Pearl River Delta will have been removed. (April 21st)

Guerrilla Commander Hu Zhaohan is Active in Suzhou, Repeatedly Killing Traitors, and Connecting with Various Armies

Suzhou News, Among the many guerrilla units active around Suzhou, there is one people's guerrilla unit composed of peasants and soldiers formed by the retreating army. The leader of this guerrilla unit is named Hu Zhaohan. He was originally from the army. There are more than 500 people in his team, equipped with complete firearms and sufficient ammunition, and carrying out political work. Train the soldiers, abide by discipline, and fulfill the responsibility of defending the territory. Now, not only is the reputation in the countryside growing day by day, and practical work has become a confidant problem for the Japanese side. For example, in October last year, in the town of Bacheng, east of Yangcheng Lake, a three-pronged attack was launched on the Japanese army's garrison. At this time, only a few Japanese guards were killed and returned due to the dark and moonless sky. In December, a rent collection office was established in the North-South Bridge Town, and more than 100 members of the Second District Anti-Opium Team were stationed. Captain Hu then led a large team of soldiers, from the west side of the Taiping Bridge, straight to the Anti-Opium Team's camp, proceeding quickly and quietly all the way, until the east was bright, and arrived in front of a tall house. Captain Hu ordered the soldiers to surround the house on all sides. The Anti-Opium Team members were awakened from their sleep and prepared to rush out of the gate, but were all intercepted by Captain Hu's subordinates. Captain Hu then explained the great righteousness and handed over all the guns and ammunition. At that time, the farmers of the villages carried hoes and shovels, and demolished the rent collection office in the North-South Bridge Town, killing the district chief and the secretary. In January of this year, it was also learned that the Ma Heng troops of the Second District Provincial Medical Inspection Team had borrowed the name of protection in Xietang Town and plundered the villagers, doing everything they could. So Captain Hu led the team and, with lightning speed, seized two light machine guns, more than 40 rifles, and a large bag of grenades. Recently, they went to Weiting Town to kill the director of the rent collection office, three staff members, and the farmers in the village were overjoyed. In addition to attacking and eradicating traitors, Captain Hu also planned some production work for the people, so the people showed such enthusiasm and enthusiasm, and there was a great encouragement in spirit. It is now said that Captain Hu has established contact with the regular army, so this unyielding and heroic guerrilla unit will be more powerful to assist, and will definitely be able to show better results.

Southwest Campaign Headquarters Promotes Second Phase of Highway Destruction, Strictly Orders Guangdong and Guangxi Battlefields to Comply, and Stipulates the Degree of Destruction of Each Road

Guilin News, the Southwest Campaign Headquarters authorities are now launching a general counter-offensive on the fronts in South China, but in order to consolidate Guangxi as the center of resistance, on the one hand, they have dispatched dozens of staff officers to inspect the strength of the troops on various fronts in the east, south, west, and north, the strength of the defenses, and the smoothness of traffic and transportation, and to collect local information in order to coordinate progress. On the other hand, they are implementing the second phase of highway destruction work and adjusting the guerrilla units on various fronts. The Lianbei Road (Guangzhou to Beihai), Qinyi Road (Qinzhou to Nanning), Tailing Road (Hepu to Lingshan), Suishi Road (Suixi to Shijiao), Dianmao Road (Dianbai to Maoming), and Xin Kai Road (Kaiping to Xin Yu) on the southern front, as well as the Wubo Road (Wulin to Bobai) and Rongcang Road (Yulin to Yuye) in southern Guangxi, as well as the roads in various towns and counties along the southeastern coast of Guangdong, will all be subject to the second phase of heavy destruction. All of the above roads that belong to the plains must be turned into paddy fields and returned to the original owners to grow rice, soybeans, wheat, and miscellaneous grains. Those that belong to the foothills of the mountains must be destroyed into shear walls. Those that belong to the passages between the two mountains must be completely filled with soil and rocks, and bamboo, wood, pine, and fir trees must be planted horizontally. All kinds of destruction work shall be supervised by the district militia commanders and the senior military officers of the defense areas, and the administrative inspectors and commissioners shall be responsible for the handling of the county governments. The county governments shall assign personnel to cooperate with the township offices to convene all villagers in the addresses, towns, and villages for total mobilization. Each shall take the assigned section and work separately. If the anti-destruction plan is not achieved, or the destruction is not thorough, resulting in the enemy's use of it, they will be punished severely for opposing the War of Resistance. The county heads and the heads of the district and township offices shall all be held jointly and severally liable. This strict order was issued yesterday by the Guilin Southwest Campaign Headquarters to the commanders of various war zones, the Guangdong-Guangxi Pacification Office, and the provincial government, and ordered to the commanders of various group armies, the commanders of various defense armies, the commanders of various militia districts, the commissioners and county governments, etc., to comply with it uniformly. They will be required to submit the thorough destruction work within one month to the Pacification Office and the provincial government, and personnel will be sent to check and report separately, so as to avoid superficial compliance and delay the major plan of the War of Resistance. The sections of the highways that have been destroyed shall be designated as guerrilla zones. A number of regular troops shall be sent to each area to defend it, and they shall cooperate with the guerrilla teams in the area to fight. The weapons, ammunition, and food in the guerrilla zone shall also be planned in advance. All arrangements are exceptionally thorough.

Education News National Compulsory Education Overview, More than 18 Million Children Enrolled Before the War, Short-Term Two-Year Elementary Schools Established in Advance After the War

(Chongqing News) Regarding the situation of national compulsory education before and after the war, the following is an abstract of the reports of the responsible divisions and sections of the Ministry of Education, and the results of surveys and statistics:

Total Number of Students

The Ministry of Education recently compiled statistics on the number of school-age children in compulsory education in various provinces and cities in the 25th year, totaling 53,091,848. Currently, 18,285,129 are receiving education, accounting for 35.09% of the total number of school-age children. On average, there are 6.92 schools per 1,000 square miles, 38.33 enrolled children per 1,000 people, 1.75 grades per school on average, 57.38 children per school on average, 32.82 children per grade on average, and 26.13 children taught per teacher on average. The average annual cost per child is 6 yuan and 52 fen. The ratio of school-age children in each province and city is: Jiangsu more than 6 million, Sichuan 5.27 million, Shandong 4.54 million, Guangdong, Hebei, Henan, and Hunan each with 3 million plus, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei each with 2 million plus, Liaoning, Jin, Han, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Shaanxi each with 1 million plus, and the rest are mostly within millions or even tens of thousands. Of these school-age children who have already received education, Shanghai has the highest percentage of 72.59% of students receiving education (rounding), followed by Shanxi 69.49, Anhui 68, Hubei 63, Beiping 62, Hunan 60, Qingdao 58, Tianjin and Guizhou each with 57, Zhejiang 53, Chahar and Rehe each with 52, Shandong and Fujian each with 42, Suiyuan 40, Pingyuan 36, and Shaanxi, Hebei, and Liaoning each with 33, Qinghai and Henan each with 31, and the rest are in the twenties or teens. Xikang accounts for the least at 4.22%, and Xinjiang accounts for 2.07%. In the 26th year, the number of children enrolled in compulsory education in various provinces and cities was 21,435,254, an increase of 3,180,225 over the previous year. In the 27th year, although the war affected the provinces in the war zone, the number of children enrolled in schools in the provinces in the rear continued to increase.

Implementation Procedure

"Phase 1" from August of the 24th year to July of the 29th year, each province and city widely established one-year short-term elementary schools to enroll children aged nine to twelve, and promoted "junior elementary schools", enriched elementary schools, "existing grade enrollment", implemented "two-part system", improved "private schools", and piloted "itinerant teaching", so that by the end of this phase, at least 80% of the total number of children in the country will have received more than one year of education. "Phase 2" from August of the 29th year to July of the 33rd year, in addition to continuing to operate in accordance with the methods of the previous phase, all one-year short elementary schools will be gradually changed to two-year short elementary schools to enroll children aged eight to twelve, so that by the end of this phase, at least 80% of the total number of children will have received two years of compulsory education. "Phase 3" from August of the 33rd year, the two-year system should be gradually changed to a four-year junior elementary school, so that all children in the country will receive at least four years of compulsory education. After this plan is determined, all laws and regulations related to the plan will be formulated, announced, and implemented in detail.

Compulsory Education Funding

Compulsory education funding should be raised locally in principle, but the central government may provide appropriate subsidies to border and impoverished provinces and cities and other provinces and cities with special circumstances. (A) "Central Subsidies to Various Provinces and Cities for Compulsory Education Funding over the Years" In the 24th year, a total of 3.2 million yuan, in addition to 2.4 million yuan from the national treasury, including 500,000 yuan for border education expenses, and 300,000 yuan allocated from the Sino-British, Sino-American, and Sino-French Boxer indemnity agencies. In the 25th year, a total of 4,575,000 yuan, in addition to 3.9 million yuan extracted from the education construction fund, including 500,000 yuan for border education expenses, and 175,000 yuan from the Sino-American, and Sino-French Boxer indemnity. In the 26th year, a total of 6,665,000 yuan, in addition to 5.9 million yuan extracted from the education construction fund, including 500,000 yuan for border education, and 265,000 yuan from the Sino-British, Sino-American, Sino-French, and Sino-Belgian Boxer indemnity. However, in that year, the education construction fund was reduced to 70% from September due to the War of Resistance, and 10,000 yuan from the Sino-Belgian Boxer indemnity was not allocated, and the subsidies allocated to the provinces and cities in the war zone were also ordered to be stopped, so the actual amount could not be issued as scheduled. In the 27th year, a total of 1,741,000 yuan, in addition to 1,407,000 yuan listed in the education construction fund, including 224,000 yuan for border education expenses, and 110,000 yuan from the Sino-British, Sino-American Boxer indemnity. (B) "Compulsory Education Funding Raised by Various Provinces and Cities Themselves Over the Years" In the 20th year, the total amount of compulsory education funds raised by various provinces, cities, and counties in addition to the original funds was 10,070,059 yuan, exceeding the total amount of central subsidies by three times. In the 25th year, a total of 14,733,831 yuan, also exceeding the central subsidy by three times. In the 26th and 27th years, except for the provinces and cities in the war zone, the provinces in the rear were unable to do their best to raise funds due to the relationship between the War of Resistance, but they were generally able to make efforts to raise and maintain funds in accordance with the 25th year.

Facility Overview

In addition to "dividing elementary school districts", organizing compulsory education committees at all levels, "improving compulsory education administrative institutions at all levels", and training compulsory education administrative cadres, "increasing the number of schools and classes", a total of 25,901 short-term elementary schools and 11,974 short-term classes were added in various provinces and cities nationwide in the 24th year, 25,173 ordinary elementary schools were added, 211 ordinary elementary school grades were added, 773 two-part system were added, 129 simplified elementary schools were added, and 119 itinerant teaching groups were set up. In the 25th year, a total of 38,117 short elementary schools and 21,444 short elementary classes were added in various provinces and cities nationwide, 13,267 ordinary elementary schools were added, 295 ordinary elementary school grades were added, 1,916 two-part system were added, 161 simplified elementary schools were added, and 735 itinerant teaching groups were set up. In the 26th and 27th years, although compulsory education in the war zone was difficult to carry out, progress continued in the rear. As for the central government's "promotion of compulsory education during the war", in addition to drafting a two-year plan to establish short-term two-year elementary schools in advance and ordering the provinces in the rear to actively handle them, a plan for educational facilities in the occupied areas has been formulated for the provinces in the war zone, ordering the provincial education halls to formulate plans for implementation, and sending instructors to various war

Wu Feng Bleaching Factory Dividend Dispute: Labor and Management Reach Amicable Agreement; Labor Force Expresses Remorse for Being Fooled; Civil Suit Abandoned, Criminal Suit Withdrawn
Thirty workers, including Shan Zhangquan and Xiao Wenyuan, of the Wu Feng Machinery Bleaching, Dyeing, and Printing Factory previously claimed that the Wu Feng Factory had a surplus of over 600,000 yuan between 1934 and 1936. According to the factory's shareholder agreement, this should have been divided into forty shares, with the workers entitled to two and a half shares, calculating to over 37,000 yuan in dividends for the workers. However, the factory actually distributed only over 3,600 yuan to the workers, leading them to suspect the factory's new manager, Li Xiuyun, and shareholders Chen Shiqing, Xu Shenchu, Qin Shao Cheng, and ten others of
embezzlement.
Therefore, they hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special Court. Li Xiuyun and others also selected four lawyers, Chen Tingrui, Zhang Shewo, Wang Xintang, and Chang Dawei, to appear in court and defend them, stating that the Wu Feng Factory shareholders only agreed that if there was a surplus, it would be divided into forty shares, with thirty shares going to the shareholders and one share going to the workers. However, the manager would assess their daily diligence and allocate the dividends accordingly. The factory actually calculated a surplus of over 132,700 yuan, with the workers' share being one-fortieth, or just over 3,300 yuan. Manager Li Xiuyun had already distributed over 3,600 yuan to the workers, so the defendants had not only not embezzled anything from the workers but had also been benevolent and righteous. They also presented the partnership agreement and annual dividend ledgers as evidence. Judge Fu Lin ruled in the civil case that the plaintiffs should file a lawsuit in the civil court. The workers then filed a lawsuit based on accounting records. The defendants, Li Xiuyun, and others, again hired lawyers Chen Tingrui, Zhang Shewo, and Wang Xintang to defend them, vaguely stating that the shareholders' agreement had nothing to do with the
workers.
The Wu Feng Factory agreed to use one of its forty shares of profit as a bonus for the workers, but this was only a business gift from the factory to reward the workers, and there was no contractual relationship with the workers. There was no basis for the source of the debt, so the workers' lawsuit was without merit and should be dismissed, with the workers bearing the litigation costs. This case was heard by Civil Court President Li Wei, who was meticulous in his investigation and held three hearings before finally reaching a verdict, declaring that the plaintiff's lawsuit and request for provisional execution were both
dismissed.
The litigation costs were to be borne equally by the plaintiff and defendant. The judgment was several thousand words long, clarifying the facts and legal principles in detail. It was heard that after the workers lost the case, they realized they had been fooled and expressed remorse to the court, abandoning the appeal. They also voluntarily withdrew the criminal suit for embezzlement and requested that the other
party not file a counterclaim.

### Assassination Attempt on Yang Zaisan Case Continued Yesterday
On the 6th of this month, at around 12:00 noon at the Dongxin Bridge intersection, a Changshu native named Yang Zaisan was unsuccessfully assassinated by gunfire. Afterward, the shooter, Xu Zi, was apprehended and confessed that he was instigated by Xiong Guisong, who paid him 300 yuan to kill Yang. The case was heard again yesterday by Judge Zhang Minsheng in the First Criminal Court. The victim, Yang Zaisan, appeared in court and stated that Mao Lin, who was the former staff member, owed him a loan of 2,500 yuan and became angry when he asked for it. Mao colluded with Xiong Guisong to have him assassinated. According to the defendant, Xu Zi's confession, Commander Xiong (referring to Xiong Guisong) had a grudge against him, so Zhou introduced him to kill Yang. The court verified the statements and decided to postpone the hearing to May 1st for further investigation.

The Guan Hua Lane was Searched, and a Korean Drug Dealer was Arrested.
At around 11:00 AM yesterday, No. 3 Guan Hua Lane, Route Lafayette in the French Concession, was suddenly searched by personnel dispatched by the Japanese side, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession police. As a result, a Korean male drug dealer was arrested.

A Fire Broke Out in the Post Office Wharf Warehouse and Chinese Arsonists Were Arrested.
A major fire occurred on the 24th of last month at the Second Warehouse of the Japanese Post Office Shipping Company on Huangpu Road in Hongkou. At the time, the fire spread to the Japanese Consulate Police Department, resulting in losses of over 500,000 yuan. Afterward, Japanese detectives were dispatched to conduct a secret investigation, suspecting that the fire was started by a Chinese arsonist group. As of yesterday, the Japanese side announced that a Chinese youth named Chen Kangtai, allegedly the leader of the group, and eight other suspects had been arrested. Chen had confessed to participating in the arson, while the suspects were still being interrogated.

Crime Roundup: Widow Robbed of a Large Sum of Money
At around 12:00 noon yesterday, four thugs, using the excuse of delivering a letter, tricked their way into the residence of a local widow, Wang Yuzhen, at No. 22 Qingyun Fang, Route Paulun in the French Concession. They robbed her of valuables, jewelry, and clothing, estimated to be worth over 6,000 yuan. The robbers then fled with their loot. The victim filed a report with the Route Petain Police Station, requesting an investigation.
At around 6:50 PM yesterday, six bandits broke into No. 333 Kangnuo Road in West Shanghai. Two of them were armed with pistols and prohibited any noise. They robbed 30 yuan in legal tender before fleeing.
At around 8:30 PM last night, three robbers arrived at No. 206 Liaoyang Road. Two of them were armed with pistols and used threats and intimidation to rob 70 yuan in cash. Before leaving, they fired a shot as a warning.

Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Administers Vaccinations
According to a report by the Director of the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, many factory owners have recently requested the Health Department to vaccinate their workers against cholera. Therefore, the department has no choice but to send personnel to the factories to administer vaccinations according to the order of requests. If factories want to specify a date, it cannot be accommodated. Any factory that urgently needs to vaccinate its employees must hire its own doctor. The required serum can be requested from the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department in writing, free of charge.

A Cross-Border Opium Trafficking Organization Was Uncovered, Over 2,000 Ounces of Opium Were Confiscated, and Thirty Criminals Were Arrested.
On the 25th, Chinese Detective Ye Yuxi, Detective Li Shugui, Detective Liu Zhaonian, Detective Zhao Bao, and Detective Guo Shouxin of the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police uncovered a large-scale opium trafficking organization, arrested thirteen criminals, and confiscated over 1,000 ounces of opium, worth over 10,000 yuan. The details are as follows: At 1:50 PM on the afternoon of the previous day, detectives from the division learned that someone was selling opium in Room 32, Yong'an Hotel, No. 227 Fujian Road. They rushed to search the premises and arrested four people from Anhui Province, Wang Chunshan, Zhang Qingshan, and two people from Jiangbei, Qi Yufa and Li Chaochen, confiscating 200 ounces of opium. Afterward, officers arrested two accomplices from Pudong, Shen Linsheng and Lu A Gen. Based on the confessions of the accomplices, they went to Room 221, Dadong Hotel, Qiaqing Road, and arrested five more people, Hu Xiaodi, Zhang Jinbang, Pan Xiang_, Xu A Lin, and Xue Chufa. They then went to No. 15, Lane 1729, Avenue Edouard VII, and arrested a Cantonese man, Guo Ming. They seized eight hundred and twenty ounces of opium at No. 223 Sichuan Road. The main culprits in the case were identified as Cao Yongsheng and Li Qisheng. The police went to No. 1084 Avenue Robert to arrest them, but they were not found. Only Li's wife, Li Jiangshi, was arrested. They were all taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing. The police lawyer, Ru Bao_, stated the circumstances of the case, stating that because there were many criminals involved, it was necessary to investigate who was involved and who was not. Therefore, the case should be temporarily
detained
for further investigation to determine whether or not to prosecute. Those who are found to be uninvolved will be released in advance. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. After Judge Feng's cross-examination, it was decided that the defendants would be temporarily
detained for one week for further questioning.

Letters to the Editor
To the Editor, After reading yesterday's report in your newspaper titled "British Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill Workers Suddenly Arrested by the Japanese," I noticed that the list of representatives of the Workers' Mutual Aid Association included Xu Yanlun, Liu Rongji, Cai Sheng, Xu Guanche, Cai Ronghua, Tang Weisheng, and He Ying. The name "Liu Renji" was a mistake for "Cai Ronghua," who is specifically responsible for leading the workers. Please correct this. Sincerely, Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill Mutual Aid Association, April 25th.
To the Editor, Today's newspaper published a news item about the death of fur merchant Luo Senfei, stating that Mr. Luo Senfei had opened our company, which is completely untrue. Mr. Luo Senfei operated independently and was not a shareholder of our company. We are concerned that this news will mislead readers and damage our company. Please correct this. Sincerely, Shanghai Shenda Foreign Company, April 25th.
To the Editor, After our company sent out the news yesterday about a freight car from the Gonghe Transport Company being intercepted, we received a letter from the company stating that the company is purely organized by legitimate Changshu people who were stranded on the isolated island after the war and are engaged in land and sea freight transportation in Shanghai to maintain their livelihood. They have no dealings with the current "political police" in Changshu. The news of the interception is detrimental to our company's reputation and should be corrected. We are forwarding this to you and hope you will investigate and make the necessary corrections. Sincerely, Modern Communications Agency, Editorial Department, Shen Bao, April 25th.
To the Editor, I recently read a news item in your newspaper about the Xi Fu Industry Employees' Mutual Aid Association, which listed my humble name as an honorary president. I found this strange. I have never been involved with this association. Therefore, I am writing to request that your editor remove my humble name and make the necessary corrections. Wu Shan_ and Cai Bing_, April 25th.
To the Editor, I recently read a news item in the local news column of your newspaper on April 25th about a child who used a knife in a fight. There was an error in the description of my occupation. I am currently a civil servant in the Revenue Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Your newspaper mistakenly identified me as a worker. I am deeply regretful. I have always admired your newspaper for its accurate reporting and hope you will correct this. Sincerely, Zhang Fengchi, April 26th

The Return of the British Ambassador to Germany  Mao Lie
Regardless of why the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, is returning at this time, the "frank document" he carries with him upon his return is worthy of attention. It is said that the content of this document is "seeking peace," and at the same time, it is almost a "warning." This is somewhat comical.
Seeking peace is expressing goodwill, while warning has at least some threatening nature. Hitler is not a fool or a child; why would he submit to the enticement of sweets and the coercion of a whip? What else is this intention, this wording, if not comical?
Yesterday, I said that the original reason for Henderson's departure has now been whitewashed and made meaningless. Now, the British government is afraid that British-German relations are at a standstill—especially after Hitler's speech on the 28th of this month, which makes this possible—so they have no choice but to call Henderson back early to remedy this defect. As for carrying a document upon his return, I believe that whether it is seeking peace or warning, they know it is useless, but it is just a way to excuse themselves and use it as a reason for returning.
What will happen after the return? Of course, there will be no new tricks to play. The demonstrative departure has become a normal action, and the future exchanges between the two countries will still be the same: on the one hand, they will try to persuade the tiger to give up its skin, and on the other hand, they will turn a deaf ear and do what they want. Knowing this would happen today, they should have regretted it earlier. With today's return, the departure in the past may be a superfluous move! Such coming and going seems to be only comical: like it's a big deal, but actually it's no big deal at all!
Of course, I have no immediate intention in saying this. And I also know their difficulties and the reasons why they have to adopt this approach. I say this only to make people understand that the content of this event may be truly just this, and not to overestimate this "seeking peace" or "warning," thinking that it will achieve something. At the same time, I still hope that the British government, in addition to this kind of superficiality, will strengthen the anti-aggression alliance on the other hand and sincerely cooperate with the Soviet Union. This work should be stepped up.
Although Chamberlain is still saying: "Henderson's return will show that the government's policy has not changed and is not softening," we also give it considerable trust, believing it to be a sincere statement. However, we always feel that his "no change" and "no softening" are really not enough, and there is a need to strengthen the combined forces!
Burial Liu Lan
From the horizon rose the vast night curtain, covering the entire wilderness. The sky was like a black and boundless sea, with not a single star, not even a crescent moon. All were submerged in the bottom of the sea. Cold, desolate, quiet, only the night chill moved.
This place used to be a fertile field that released fragrance, and golden rice ears shook with the waves of abundance. In the morning and evening, wisps of blue smoke rose from the tops of thatched cottages, slowly blending into the milky white morning mist and the crimson sunset. The gurgling water surrounded the houses. It was a peaceful and tranquil village.
Now, quietly lying are ruins and broken tiles. The rugged land exhales a rotten smell, a bloody smell. Even the sounds of nature seem to be wailing. The world is buried under the heavy pressure of death.
A group of black shadows wriggled towards here, like a small snake, stubbornly crawling. Finally, they stopped and rested by a small stream. There were more than thirty men. They carried miscellaneous gun skills, such as the 38 rifle and the Mauser pistol. They wore various clothes, such as military uniforms and short jackets. They had different faces, square and round. However, people's hearts were not "as different as their faces." Belief and will forged the brothers into a piece of steel, and the struggle was an anvil, hammering them purer and stronger.
"Dead." Two brothers from the team who were carrying the body lowered the crude stretcher, touched the wounded man, and uttered these two simple words. The tone was melancholy and low. Passing through the night sky, this news twisted everyone's face, causing sorrowful spasms. Pain resided in the hearts of the entire team, like a crow perched on the top of a tower in the sunset, but it was not a gorgeous dusk, but a vast and dark night. Suddenly, a black door opened with a bang, and a tongue rolled out, swallowing a stubborn soul, one who had played with death all day long.
The team was shrouded in silence, and people did not speak. Three comrades silently dug a pit, one shovel after another, as if they were cutting at their own hearts.
The cold night wind caressed their faces, like playful, unknown insects, making people drowsy. However, these men were still like strange stones. Excessive grief had numbed people's senses.
Under the solemn gaze of more than sixty eyes, the martyred warrior returned to the earth. He was buried. Resentment burned in the chests of the living, and sparks of revenge burst forth in their hearts.
"Today, one comrade sacrificed in a battle. The death of a comrade will certainly make us sad, but sacrifice is unavoidable. We must have the courage to face death. Freedom and liberation must be exchanged with blood. For the eternal existence of the nation, we should not be stingy with our personal lives. Comrade ×'s death is glorious and great." The captain suppressed his emotions and said each word firmly and forcefully. "We should commemorate the martyred comrade with more tenacious and persistent resistance!"
The white dove in his heart was flapping its wings, wanting to fly out of the hole. The last sentence stirred the wings of the white dove, arousing the intention to fly.
In the deep night, the shadows wriggled forward again, finally disappearing into the endless night.
In the distant sky, the sharp sound of gunfire pierced the silence of the long night.
Occasional Mood Yang Yanqi
According to aesthetic theory, the entire process of creating beauty can be expressed in four stages: impression, expression, aesthetic pleasure, and translation of facts into phenomena. The beauty of literature seems a bit elusive, and no theory can be applied to it; however, we still cannot help but acknowledge that the so-called beauty of literature has at least an impression stage.
Due to this impression, we can go a little further to explore the author's mood. A beautiful scenery, a beautiful fact, or a beautiful object must be imprinted on a responsive heart in order to create a beautiful painting or a beautiful article. The English poet William Wordsworth once confused beauty and truth as the same thing, and even ancient Chinese literati often could not distinguish between beauty and truth. In fact, beauty is a ring, and truth is also a ring. When two rings are put together, they cannot be separated, but even though they are two rings, it is easy to confuse them as the same thing. Therefore, this feeling cannot be erased even now.
Where there is beauty, there must be ugliness. Beauty comes from a responsive heart, and ugliness comes from a heart that is not responsive. Not having responsiveness, to put it nicely, is lacking the ability to express beauty; to put it badly, is like gently stroking a corpse; the dead are already cold and stiff, how can they feel the goodwill of stroking? Eating fish requires eating fresh fish, and reading articles requires reading non-formulaic articles. These two things are barely similar.
If the soul is a numb thing, it cannot live. However, those with the ability will also "occasionally" have a mental breakdown and have an experience of "sudden enlightenment."
Whether there is such a thing as genius, I dare not say! Just like the lack of divinity in child prodigies, there is really no such thing as true genius. If there is, it is a person who has a sudden enlightenment from an occasional mental breakdown. Perhaps it can be considered good luck coming to the door, or a lucky star shining brightly; if they write smoothly, there will be an uncontrollable "occasional mood" to provide materials. Saying it is worthy of admiration, it still lacks respect.
One cannot "accidentally" succeed with an object, a memory, or even a cloud of fantasy. One can only accidentally see or accidentally think, which causes a reaction in the heart, slowly dissolving and slowly refining; then a masterpiece will be drawn from the pen and paper, and a beautiful literary monument will be established between heaven and earth.
Everyone has their own opinions, and everyone has their own emotions; one should also respect one's own opinions and respect one's own emotions. To respect, one must first refine the opinions and emotions in one's mind so that they are refined and radiant before they are qualified to be respected. However, believers in "occasional mood" have never paid attention to how their brains work, and only know how to "occasionally" come up with a few "amazing performances" (I almost wrote "amazing theories"). It can be considered showing off, and it is also possible to seize the opportunity to become a hero. With a little mood, they hope to shock the world, overturn the Pacific Ocean, and collapse the Himalayas, so that they, the great hero who stands upright, can grab Gorky with one hand, step on Lu Xun with one foot, and blow out a thousand feet of light in one breath.
"Gradual enlightenment" may be a toy for fools; but is "sudden enlightenment" truly real? Even if it exists, will it stand firm in thought and never perish? "Gradual enlightenment" is a matter for the mentally deficient, but can't the mentally deficient be the tortoise in the tortoise and hare race?
The greatest wisdom may seem like foolishness, and I hope those with great wisdom will be humble. However, to say something that spoils the scenery: there is no great wisdom in the world, only fools who think they have great wisdom.
Road of Many Forks Ding Di
When boating on the winding Qujiang River with many islands, or driving on an ancient road with many crisscrossing ruts, a traveler often feels lost due to not knowing the direction and ends up on a road with many forks.
It is not a straight heavenly path without road signs or guides, and the sky is also very gloomy. Rain is coming from the mountains, and dark clouds fill the sky. You cannot climb high to see far, nor can you observe the details. You will have no heart to walk leisurely and calmly, and remain independent on the road with many forks. The livestock are tired, and you are also hungry and thirsty. You have to avoid being robbed by bandits and becoming a victim to wolves and tigers. You should stop to rest and find a place to stay for the night. Therefore, you have to choose a road that you should take from several roads with many forks.
Everyone has their own future, and everyone has a "rest stop." The livestock are tired, and people are also hungry and thirsty. Dusk is also approaching. You cannot stand still on the road with many forks and sleep in the wilderness. Therefore, travelers prop up their oars and shake their paddles, feed their horses and grease their wheels, and climb hills, cross wet meadows, rush over shoals, and wind around harbors. They also encounter headwaters and tailwinds, difficulties and plains, bird paths and sheep intestines, life and death, and fortune and misfortune.
The road is unpredictable. It is difficult to predict your comfort and hardship from the plains and dangers in front of you. A wise and upright traveler must not forget his future because of momentary comfort.
The road with many forks also determines the fate with many forks. Often, a happy road is buried in thorns, while an evil road is full of fruit juice. Friend, how will you choose your way?
Will you eat that fruit juice? Or will you let the thorns pierce your feet? There is no happy road from the beginning, no olives that are not sour, and no eternally peaceful life. Life, a temporary journey between heaven and earth, is it not also a changeable road with many forks? The torment of poverty, the whip of power, and the sweet enticement often make you lose your judgment. You cannot calm down and take care of your honor and disgrace, life and death, ancestors and descendants. Therefore, you enjoy the sweet fruit juice and abandon the thorns.
The present sorrow and joy are all illusory. Short-sighted people cannot see through the illusion, so they all experience the sorrow and joy of the moment.
Sorrow and joy are often impermanent. The present success may be the future frustration. The smooth road to success leads to being trapped in a quagmire; drinking the fruit juice leads to death from poison; those who are full of hope for a safe night's sleep may also be buried by wolves and tigers. A foolish smile still remains on the lips, and greed and momentary comfort have been exchanged for cruelty and misery.
Is there anything more changeable than the road of many forks in a fleeting world? Happy, miserable, dark, bright, upright, and evil roads are all laid out before you for you to choose. Each road has its own destiny. The road has many forks, and fate also has many forks. It is up to you to choose. You can bring disaster or fortune, leave a bad name for thousands of years, or leave a good name for generations.
Perhaps you clearly know that you are heading towards your future, but you are afraid to take a thorny road. People are tired, hungry, and the road is long. Your body is cold, and you have nothing to wear or eat. Naturally, you are powerless and tired. Naturally, you will grit your teeth and say fiercely, "Let's just do it," so you embark on the evil road. You say it is for life.
That's right, everyone has to live. You are living now by embarking on the evil road. Not only are you living, but you can also indulge in debauchery. You are satisfied with the present, but have you ever looked far into the distance, at the distant mountains and the other shore? Can you point out to me the joy beyond those few arrows, the final end?
You are happy, can I not be sad?
So I tremble and open my eyes to look at the heights and the distance. I discern the confusing roads. Finally, I find that there are only two: the present suffering and the present joy.
I find another peak and see even higher and farther. I still see two roads: eternal suffering and eternal joy. The present joy and suffering are not the same as the eternal, but are opposite.
The road of many forks also determines the fate of many forks. Choose, you and I should get on the road.
Rain is coming from the mountains, dark clouds fill the sky, and dusk is approaching again. Is it not the time when you are hungry, tired, and shaken?
The road of many forks is difficult to discern in the vastness. You must be careful in choosing where to go.

This seems like a sweet smile, permeating people's souls, obscuring their reason, causing them to forget everything, and even forget themselves!
As if crazy, when people encounter that intoxicating dream, intoxicating wine, intoxicating smile, intoxicating song... and everything with bewitching magic, they are like entering a land of confusion, they love this intoxication, this intoxication containing poison.
However, people's hearts are so haggard that they cannot withstand the slightest anesthesia. When they are

### Anti-Aggression Front: Soviet Proposal Has Broader Scope; Britain Believes It Cannot Be Implemented at Present; Has Been Circulated to France, Poland, and the Three Baltic States for Reference

(Paris) The content of the Soviet counter-proposal is being kept secret by officials. However, it is known here that the counter-proposal does not involve the Far East, but its scope is broader than the original Anglo-French proposal, which only involved the Three Baltic States. (Reuter's dispatch, 25th)

(London) Well-informed sources here have announced that the government is continuing negotiations with relevant countries regarding the organization of an anti-aggression bloc. The Soviet government's recently proposed counter-proposal advocates that countries mutually accept constraints, clearly targeting Germany. The government has circulated the proposal to France, Poland, and Romania, along with several comments, requesting that these countries study it. It is generally said that this counter-proposal, in its current form, is impractical. The British government will still ask the Soviet Union to consider its original proposal, namely that the Soviet Union provide guarantees, declaring that if any neighboring country is subjected to aggression and seeks Soviet assistance, then the Soviet Union will provide assistance to the extent specified by the invaded country. This is because Poland and Romania are both unwilling to directly establish an agreement with the Soviet Union. The British original proposal, accepted by the Soviet Union, is a unilateral constraint and is welcomed by these countries. In addition, the British government is also encouraging Romania to enter into a military agreement with Poland to supplement the deficiencies of the current guarantee agreement. It is said that the discussions that the authorities have been conducting with Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu in recent days have involved this matter. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

(London) During the session of the House of Commons this afternoon, Riley, a Labour Party member of the opposition, asked whether the government would negotiate a joint defense agreement with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria to curb aggression. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler immediately replied in the negative. Labour Party member Baker then asked whether the government recognized Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Prime Minister Chamberlain avoided answering. Another Labour Party member, Sorensen, raised a question regarding the suggestions contained in President Roosevelt's telegram. Prime Minister Chamberlain then replied that the raw materials produced by the British colonies were, in practice, available for purchase by any other country. Therefore, the British government would be happy to consider any suggestions aimed at improving the distribution of raw materials. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

### British-Romanian Negotiations Yield Concrete Results; Britain Also Provides Financial Assistance; Poland Also Offers Guarantees to Romania

(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu held talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax at the Foreign Office this afternoon, and it is reported that [tangible progress] has been made. The main issue discussed by both sides was the Soviet government's counter-proposal on organizing an anti-aggression bloc. According to Romanian sources here, Poland has offered guarantees to Romania, declaring that the current alliance treaty between the two countries applies not only to aggression from the Soviet Union, but also to aggression from all other quarters. If this is the case, then this alliance treaty is already very strong and does not need to have any connection with the future anti-aggression alliance. Regarding the outcome of the talks between the British and Romanian ministers, it is said that an official communique will be issued tomorrow. Foreign Minister Gafencu is scheduled to travel to Paris tomorrow afternoon at 4:30, accompanied by Romanian Minister Tilea, to hold talks with the French government authorities, and then proceed to Rome for a trip. It is generally known that he will endeavor to mediate between France and Italy to resolve their disagreements and reconcile them. In addition, according to sources in Rome, Foreign Minister Gafencu will also travel to the capital of Yugoslavia to advise the country to adhere to the Balkan Entente Pact. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

(London) According to Reuter's diplomatic correspondent, there is reason to believe that an agreement has been reached on a method for Britain to provide Romania with various facilities under the export credit scheme, so that Romania can effectively increase its exports to Britain. It is also believed that the issue of supplying Romania with armaments will be discussed. In addition, general European situation and the special circumstances of the Balkans, as well as the situation arising from Britain's guarantee to Romania, have also been thoroughly reviewed. It is reported that Britain and Romania have agreed that, at present, Romania has no reciprocal obligations for Britain's guarantee. The two sides also discussed the complex situation of the current British-Soviet discussions and Romania's attitude towards accepting Soviet military assistance. (Reuter's dispatch, 25th)
