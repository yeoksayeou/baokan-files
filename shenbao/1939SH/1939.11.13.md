### President Chiang Kai-shek's Opening Address

Chongqing. In his opening address to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, President Chiang Kai-shek stated in brief: We are holding the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee on the Prime Minister's birthday. It has been nine months since the closing of the Fifth Plenary Session. During these nine months, our domestic enemy has intensified its political and economic offensives in addition to its military offensive. On the international front, there have been shifts in the relationships of various countries. In September, the European war broke out. The extent of this war and its outcome cannot be predicted today. People around the world are working hard to safeguard their national security and restore world peace. Therefore, the past nine months can be said to be a period of great uncertainty. Because we are working hard to resist the war, all national policies have been decided early, so our position is clear and our governance is simple. We can use a simple strategy to manage a complex situation. We only need to concentrate the minds and strength of the whole country and prepare to fight against the only enemy that is invading us. Although our task is arduous, our mood is very stable. Everyone only needs to think about what the dangerous situation of our national fortune would be, and how difficult it would be to deal with it, if we had not risen up to resist the war on July 7, 1937, and today suddenly faced such a major change in the world situation caused by the European war. Thinking of this, we should pay our deep respect and gratitude to the countless soldiers and civilians who have heroically sacrificed and persevered in their struggles for two years and four months. Today, we are holding the Sixth Plenary Session to review the current situation, reflect on past work, and determine future plans. At the same time, we must unanimously recognize the increasing importance of the Party's responsibilities. We have indeed reached a critical juncture in the final victory. We must further inspire our compatriots across the country to achieve our great mission of seeking national independence and freedom, realizing the Three Principles of the People, and contributing to lasting world peace. But the most important thing is for all our comrades to realize the importance of "establishing determination and confidence" that I said at the Fifth Plenary Session, to recognize the responsibility that our Chinese nation should bear in this turbulent world, to recognize the ebb and flow of the situation between us and the enemy, and the inevitability of those who have the Dao receiving more help, to recognize the clumsy and ridiculous nature of the Japanese's recent launch of rumor offensives and divisive tactics, to recognize the great contribution that our steadfast efforts today make to the current international situation, and also to recognize the truth that our resistance war is consistent with the safety of the world. The military and political developments of the past nine months have been detailed in other reports, so I don't need to repeat them here. What I want to emphasize at the opening of today's plenary session is what we stated at the Fifth Plenary Session, that our country "as long as it is not controlled by imperialists, is not deceived, persists in resisting the war, and fights to the end, the failure of the Japanese is inevitable," and what I reported at the Third and Fourth National Political Consultative Conferences, that "the Japanese military force is becoming increasingly exhausted and militarily in a more and more difficult position," and that "our military strength has more than doubled compared to before the war." From the battles in southern Shanxi, northern Hubei, and especially the recent battle in northern Hunan, everyone can get factual proof. As a result of my recent observations at the front, I can tell all comrades that our soldiers not only have the belief that they will win the war, but also the officers and soldiers in all theaters of war have the common desire to recover lost territory as soon as possible. In addition, there is a significant improvement, that is, the improvement in various military technologies and the smooth execution of orders. The victory in northern Hunan and the vital blow to the Japanese are the main reasons for this. Furthermore, in terms of public morale, in the past nine months, the spirit of our compatriots who are determined not to yield has been greatly enhanced. No one with self-respect would be tempted. Other examples, such as the vigorous activities in the rear, the strengthening of economic strength, the universal implementation of the National Covenant, and the progress of military-civilian cooperation, all prove that our compatriots, regardless of their intelligence, strength, weakness, age, or youth, have recognized the principle that we and the enemy cannot coexist and that loyalty and treachery cannot exist together. The examples I personally saw and heard during my inspection at the front are too numerous to mention. There are people who originally retreated to seek refuge, but when they met the army, they voluntarily returned to the front to guide the army to fight. There are also people who volunteered to join the army and fight bravely, refusing to retreat even when wounded, and even sacrificing their lives. As for their actions, they all absolutely obeyed orders. As long as it is conducive to the war of resistance, no matter what the sacrifice or hardship, the military and civilians cooperate and do not distinguish between each other. This level was completely unattainable in the first phase of the war of resistance. The stronger we fight, the stronger we become is indeed a fact. I can responsibly tell all comrades that our military, no matter when or under what circumstances, will be able to achieve final victory and will never fail first. But precisely because of this, the other side is now particularly panicked and at a loss. Knowing that there is no way to continue the military aggression against China, they are doing everything possible to carry out policies of aggression other than military ones to reverse the decline. This is the time when they are carrying them out in the most fragmented and erratic way. Therefore, during the opening of today's plenary session, I want to talk to all comrades about the trend of the Far East situation and the relationship between China's war of resistance and world safety. First, we must expose the clumsiness of the Japanese warlords' plot, which is a reflection of their panic mentality. Because of the outbreak of the European war, according to the experience of the last European war, on the one hand, they can take advantage of the fire to intensify their aggression, and on the other hand, they can develop their industry and commerce and strengthen the use of trade systems while Europe is at war. But now, because they are being strongly resisted in their invasion of China, all their strength is being used to cope with China's war of resistance, and their domestic industries are also being consumed by the war of aggression against China. The great opportunity will be easily lost. Their sorrow in this situation and their urgency to end the Sino-Japanese war cannot be described in words. Therefore, on the one hand, they have to support those who are obviously not qualified to call, and on the other hand, they want to disperse the countries concerned in the Far East one by one by using the strategy of dividing and conquering, so that they can realize their dream of resolving the China Incident with all their strength first. In short, they want to stabilize all the countries concerned, but not all countries in the world are as clumsy as they are. Judging from their actions in the past two months, they have obviously focused on diplomacy with the United States and the Soviet Union, while at the same time not forgetting Germany, Britain, and France. But their attitude toward the United States is to try to compromise as much as possible, while tearing up the Nine-Power Treaty and destroying the Open Door Policy. Can the United States tolerate this? Their attitude toward the Soviet Russia now is to try their best to be friendly, but at the same time they are unwilling to forget their national policy and still want to monopolize Manchuria and Mongolia. Will the Soviet Russia agree to this? What is especially ridiculous is that their attitude toward Germany is that in today's situation, they still want Germany to fulfill the Anti-Comintern Pact. Can Germany do this? Their attitude toward Britain and France is to oppress and humiliate them at first, and then try to compromise. They want to win them over and take the opportunity to advance south to Nanyang and the Far East colonies of Britain, France, and the Netherlands, hoping to replace them. Can France be deceived?

Editorial

### Europe's Thorough Research into Peace Appeals

Belgium and the Netherlands are easily caught in the crossfire of the European war. This newspaper briefly mentioned this yesterday. According to yesterday's dispatches: the German-Dutch border is increasingly tense, and there are claims that German troops have been spotted in the "no man's land" between them; moreover, the Dutch government has already deliberately flooded part of the "flood defense line." Two weeks ago, King Leopold III of Belgium and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands met in The Hague, the Dutch capital, and immediately sent a joint telegram to the heads of state of Britain, France, and Germany. After the two countries declared war, they both stated that they were willing to consider any suggestion that could form a fair and reasonable basis for peace. Based on this statement, the Belgian and Dutch monarchs acted as intermediaries to appeal for mediation and requested the three countries to propose various methods to lay the groundwork for lasting peace. For a week, King Haakon VII of Norway, King Christian X of Denmark, King Gustav V of Sweden, and President Kallio of Finland responded in kind, expressing their support from the sidelines and sending telegrams to the Belgian and Dutch monarchs. Among the neutral countries of Northern Europe, only King Carol II of Romania in Central Europe echoed the call; otherwise, there has been silence. As for the United States, Secretary of State Hull issued a statement saying, "The Belgian and Dutch governments have not directly notified the United States of their joint peace appeal, nor have they asked the United States to participate in any efforts to end the war." The reason for the silence of other countries is largely the same. Most noteworthy is that the heads of state of the three belligerent countries—Britain, France, and Germany—have not yet responded a week after receiving the telegram. On the British side, it was reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain would give an informal response in a speech at the "Lord Mayor's Show" on the 9th, but he was absent that day due to illness; the speech read by Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon instead referred to the suggestions of the Belgian and Dutch monarchs, saying that Hitler might not respond favorably, and that Britain would only be able to reply after consulting with allied countries and dominions. German leader Hitler delivered a speech at the 16th-anniversary meeting of the Nazi Party on the evening of the 8th; French President Lebrun made a radio address on the morning of the 12th to commemorate the European armistice. Both represented the will of their nations, yet neither made any mention of the proposals of the Dutch and Belgian monarchs. According to the linguistic warfare in European international relations in recent years, there has always been an immediate and echoing response; each round has mostly been a matter of morning and evening, demonstrating the prowess of verbal jousting and, even more so, the confidence of all parties involved. There has been no hesitation. However, this time, the world is watching the Belgian and Dutch monarchs mediate for a truce, and the three countries have shown no response after a week, which cannot help but surprise people. If one were to say that Belgium and the Netherlands are weak and their words are not valued by the three countries, and thus ignored, this would not be the case. Not only is it impermissible in terms of international etiquette to ignore them, but also in times of war, seeking cooperation with other countries, no detail is spared, how would either side dare to overlook the so-called weak ones? Moreover, Belgium and the Netherlands each possess considerable strength in terms of economy and military preparedness, and cannot be disregarded. If one were to say that the three countries are in a situation where they cannot dismount from the tiger they are riding, and therefore can only ignore the calls for peace, this would also not be the case. Since the belligerents each have their own beliefs, they can simply reply accordingly based on what they believe. Why fear the effort of writing a response? If one were to say that the three countries at war each have unspeakable secrets, and are therefore bound to be hesitant in the face of friendly inquiries, this is also not the case. Since the war began more than two months ago, the belligerent countries have made countless announcements to the world. While their words may not be entirely sincere, they have all been eloquent and unhindered in their arguments. How could they not respond to the Belgian and Dutch monarchs? It has been reported that London and Paris are exchanging views, and that there is a firm category between war and peace, but the method of response is still under consideration. In fact, the method of replying by telegram, from head of state to head of state, is inevitable. To say that it is under consideration is merely a pretext. According to a dispatch from The Hague yesterday, the German envoy to the Netherlands, Mr. Zech, was ordered to meet with the Dutch Foreign Minister, Mr. Kleffens, and informed him that the German government was conducting a thorough study of the Belgian and Dutch monarchs' mediation efforts to cease hostilities. If this is the case, then unless Germany is determined to violate Dutch neutrality, and is merely delaying Dutch defenses with empty words while preparations are not yet complete, then the so-called thorough study may indeed be credible. Moreover, it is not only Germany that is in this situation; Britain and France also have reasons to conduct a thorough study. Is this the reason why Britain and France have not yet responded? Indeed, this European war is unprecedentedly serious in its nature of contention, the cruelty of its consequences, the complexity of the divisions between friend and foe, and the fundamental questions of political ideology and social organization. Therefore, even if the belligerent countries have absolute confidence in ultimate victory, they are, in reality, very apprehensive about matters beyond military affairs, after the war, and in the international arena. Three countries are at war, but the resulting changes may lead to a situation in which the wartime situation and the post-war destiny are no longer within the control of the belligerent countries themselves. Germany initially favored a swift and decisive victory, but recently, Hitler also admitted that the war might last for three years or more. Britain and France, although from the beginning, claimed to be prepared for a long and arduous struggle until complete victory, judging from the international situation since the outbreak of the war, it is suspected that Germany is not the only one hoping for a swift and decisive victory. What both sides are now thoroughly studying is whether a swift and decisive victory can be the central issue of war and peace.

### British and French Heads of State Telegraph Replies to Dutch and Belgian Appeals: The Key to Lasting Peace Lies in Germany; Solutions Adapting to British and French Policies Can Be Considered; German Authorities Declare Thorough Study of Various Proposals

London: Following the peace appeal by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, King George VI of Britain has recently sent separate telegrams in reply, stressing that a lasting peace must be secured before hostilities can cease. The telegrams stated, "We are determined to seek a glorious peace, and the basic conditions have been clearly stated. As can be seen from the documents made public since the beginning of the war, the cause of the war and who bears the blame are clear. In short, Germany's aggression against Poland is the direct reason for our country's decision to participate in the war. Moreover, Germany's policy towards its neighbors has always been dominated by aggression, and the trampling of Poland is just one example. Our people only resorted to force after all efforts to maintain peace failed. The greater goal of this war, as our Prime Minister said, is to eliminate the fear of German aggression among European countries, so that nations can maintain their independence and freedom, thereby preventing other countries from using force again instead of resolving international disputes through peaceful means. This goal has been repeatedly supplemented and clarified. The statements made by our Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the 12th of last month, and by our Foreign Secretary in the House of Lords on the 2nd of this month, are detailed. Furthermore, all solutions must take these statements as essential elements in order to lay the foundation for a lasting peace. If Your Majesty is willing to share any suggestions from Germany that are consistent with our country's war goals, our government will seriously consider them." (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Paris: Following the peace appeal by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, French President Lebrun sent a telegram today, stating, "We have received your telegram and deeply admire your insightful views. In today's world, no nation is more peaceful than the French, nor is any nation willing to accept greater sacrifices for European peace. France is determined to welcome all measures that can establish a fair and lasting peace for all nations. This has been the case in the past, and it remains so today. This attitude has been expressed repeatedly. Only a peace based on justice can be a lasting peace. Since two years ago, the use of violence and force has been common, the most solemn agreements have been disregarded, all promises have been broken, and three countries in Europe have been enslaved or destroyed. The security of other countries has also been threatened. France has therefore taken up arms, hoping to stop this secret affair. The unfair treatment suffered by Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland under violence must be compensated, and at the same time, they must be given sufficient guarantees in politics and economics so that the freedom of all countries can be respected. Only then is it possible to lay the foundation for a lasting peace. In short, humanity must be certain that violations of justice will not happen again in order to eliminate fear and anxiety. Any solution that serves to confirm an unjust victory can only bring about an unstable truce for Europe, which is vastly different from the legitimate and lasting peace that Your Majesty has called for. All countries whose security and independence have been threatened by Germany's actions hope to restore this precious peace, but the key to peace lies not in France but in Germany. Whether peace can be restored depends on the country's declaration." (Havas dispatch, 12th)

The Hague: Semi-official sources have recently announced that German envoy Zech was instructed by his government to visit Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens and informed him that the German government is conducting a thorough study of the Belgian and Dutch heads of state's mediation efforts to cease hostilities.

### Japan Flatters the United States: Compensation in Cash for Some Damages Suffered by American Nationals in China

Washington: The Japanese Embassy here announced yesterday that it has resolved several cases affecting American interests in China, including the bombing of a Lutheran church in China by Japanese aircraft. A spokesperson claimed that the important issue of the Japanese army occupying the American-owned Shanghai University of Hujiang had been delayed, but the damaged buildings have been repaired, and both parties have reached an agreement to allow three families of faculty and staff to return to Hujiang University. Other resolved cases include the reopening of the O'Hara Red Seal Milk Company's farm, which had been closed to third-country nationals, cash compensation for losses suffered by the American Brotherhood Hall in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, due to Japanese naval bombing, cash compensation for the Japanese seizure of American-owned merchant ships in Shamian, Guangzhou, and the embassy announced that other American churches and farms damaged by the Japanese army will be investigated and resolved as soon as possible.

### Centennial Celebration of the U.S. Army War College: Roosevelt Instructs on the Path to Peace: Striving to Eradicate Hatred and Fear from All of Humanity; Correcting Past Mistakes and Establishing a Peace of Freedom

Washington: Today marks the centennial of the founding of the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia, and also the twenty-first anniversary of the armistice ending the last European war. President Roosevelt, as he had to go to the cemetery of the war dead to preside over the ceremony, used the telephone to convey a message to the school, stating, in brief, that what we pray for is peace, and the only goal of our country's military expansion is to create an environment that can establish a free and lasting peace. Moreover, the peace we need must be better than the peace that resulted from the last European war, so that all of humanity in the world can abandon the hatred and unconscious desires that created the era of terror. This new and better peace is what all of humanity is eagerly praying for. At this moment, the American people are determined to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors, abide by their legacy, and work for peace. But history proves that peace cannot be based on weakness, and we must never deceive ourselves with wishful thinking. Especially in today's situation, we must be deeply vigilant. In short, we are now seeking a simple language so that countries and people can communicate openly, and the nature and ideals of people of all countries can be free from all shackles of fear and fully express themselves. This is the path to peace, and I will sincerely and earnestly work to find it, as I have in the past, and will continue to do so in the future. Moreover, this great goal is not only what armed soldiers should devote all their efforts to, but also what the general public, who want to base freedom on lasting peace, should work together to achieve. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

New York: A commemoration of the armistice was held here today. Mayor La Guardia gave a radio address to Europe, speaking of the difference between this armistice commemoration and previous ones, stating, in brief, that the peace that was restored twenty-one years ago has now been destroyed. This day is truly not a happy day, because the two minutes of silence that we hold in America to commemorate our fallen comrades cannot be held simultaneously in Britain and France by our comrades and their descendants. No less than 50,000 people heard this speech here, and also heard the replies from the mayors of London and Paris. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

### The Pope Explains: The Source of All Evil Lies in Failing to Distinguish Between Good and Evil

Vatican City: Pope Pius XII addressed the American bishops today, stating that the root of all evil in the world lies in failing to distinguish between good and evil. Many schools in the United States neglect Christianity and reject teachings that are not within the scope of nationalism. The high number of divorces shows that more Christian moral principles should be adopted. Labor and management should also cooperate to protect the rights of both parties in accordance with fair and honest regulations. (Reuters, 12th)

Paris: French Prime Minister Daladier delivered an armistice commemorative speech today at the cemetery of war dead, stating that victory will belong to us. Britain and France now constitute the most powerful group in the world. From Canada to Australia, from South Africa to New Zealand and India, from North Africa to Central Africa, from Madagascar to Vietnam, all who have the resources are prepared to use their vast wealth to aid the front lines. Victory in war will ultimately belong to the noblest, most generous, and most benevolent side, as it has always been, and even more so now. (Reuters, 12th)

### British Queen's Broadcast: A Message to the Women of the British Empire: Modern Women Must Also Contribute to the War

London: Queen Elizabeth of Britain delivered an armistice speech tonight to the women of the British Empire in simple and moving terms, saying that for twenty years, we have used this day as a day to commemorate the deceased and never forget them. Why is it that the peace created by our sacrifices has now been destroyed, and we are forced to fight again? I know that you wish me to express, in the name of the women of the British Empire, our deep sympathy for the women of Poland who were the first to suffer the cruel blow. We also do not forget the courage of the women of France. From ancient times to the present, women have had to possess a resolute spirit in times of war. Although in the past, women felt that their efforts for the war could not contribute much, the situation is now very different. We women, like men, have important work to do ourselves. This mission has now arrived. The Queen then spoke of family separations, husbands going to war, and children being scattered, saying that the King and I know this suffering. Women of all countries now yearn to rebuild a better new world so that all people in the world can enjoy a day of peace. This day will eventually arrive. I know that you will be able to fulfill your responsibilities and that when we have struggled to win lasting peace, we will be able to freely and unhinderedly devote ourselves to the greater happiness of mankind. We believe in God. In times of hardship, God is our strength. I earnestly pray that God will forever bless you and guide you. (Reuters, 11th)

### Differing Propaganda from Britain, France, and Germany: The Situation in the Netherlands Suddenly Eases: British Nationals in Belgium and the Netherlands Can Voluntarily Evacuate

Amsterdam: British nationals in the Netherlands received a letter today from the British Consulate, informing them that if they have no special reason to stay, they should return home as soon as possible. Reuters has learned that this measure is only precautionary and that there is no intention to consider the situation critical. The situation in the Netherlands is more relaxed today, and well-informed sources believe that this particular crisis is gradually disappearing. What is most comforting is that the flooding of the main defense areas has not expanded. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange was more excited today, and the Hague Stock Exchange also reduced its anxiety. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

Brussels: The British Nationals Committee in Belgium has informally notified British nationals who can afford to do so to prepare to leave the country. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

Amsterdam: Dutch officials deny reports that Germany has submitted an ultimatum to the Netherlands. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

Amsterdam: British Wireless News Agency yesterday had to revise its report on the situation in the Netherlands. It was claimed that Dutch politicians were extremely dissatisfied with the alarming rumors. Hague officials believe that the Netherlands is not threatened. The Dutch government is now considering taking certain measures against foreign correspondents who spread exaggerated news, especially about the Dutch "dike defense plan." (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

Amsterdam: The Dutch newspapers have all written articles commenting on the alarming news that Dutch neutrality is threatened. The Rotterdamsche Nieuwsblad reported that most of these rumors were spread by the newspapers of the belligerent countries and must be carefully identified. The Telegraph reported that the news obtained by its correspondents did not correspond to this alarming promise, and that the German newspapers still maintained a calm attitude towards the Netherlands. When German military plans had not yet been announced, the situation in the Netherlands was indeed very delicate, but in recent days, there has been no reason to determine that the situation has deteriorated. (Haitong dispatch, 11th)

Brussels: According to reliable sources, the Belgian cabinet held a cabinet meeting yesterday to study the attitude that Belgium should adopt when Germany invades the Netherlands. Although no communiqué was issued afterwards, there must have been important decisions. Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot also had a long conversation with Defense Minister General Denis after the cabinet meeting. In addition, Foreign Minister Spaak also met with Dutch Envoy Sluyter this afternoon, presumably to inform him of the cabinet's decision yesterday. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

Brussels: Belgian Defense Minister Denis delivered a radio address last night, stating that if Belgium wants to stay out of the war, it must have a strong military as a backing. War is a tragedy for humanity, and the Belgian army is sufficient to guarantee Belgium's freedom. The future is bright, and we have full faith. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

Berlin: According to the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, the claim that island countries are permanently immune from enemy invasion is not a sacred law. The times may have suddenly changed. Whether island countries with insufficient military equipment are not attackable will be proven by facts in the future. The victory or defeat of a war should be determined by courage and ideals, not by fixed traditional principles. Once a country has decided to go to war, its isolation, which has been maintained for centuries, may for the first time encounter the pain of war. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

### The Situation in Germany: Calm and Composed

Berlin: Abnormal weather in Germany in October affected agriculture in many places, causing farmers to be able to engage in harvesting work only for a short period of time. At the same time, because many farmers have responded to the call to join the army, women have also engaged in this work, harvesting crops such as potatoes and turnips. The National Hitler Youth specially organized men, women, and children in various places to go to the countryside to work. The German military authorities also issued an order for soldiers on the front line to rush to the west to engage in harvesting work. Now, with the help of the army, the crops in the west have been harvested in just a few days. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

Berlin: The people of Germany have now begun to prepare to celebrate the first wartime Christmas. Every family still buys Christmas trees as in the past. In Berlin alone, 850,000 trees will be needed, 100,000 of which will be donated by charitable organizations to poor families, and the rest will be sold at estimated prices. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

### Japanese Ministry of Finance Reviews Next Year's Budget

Tokyo: Because the next session of the Diet is scheduled to convene on December 23, the Ministry of Finance is now rushing to review the budget and revenue estimates. According to the preliminary investigation in yesterday's meeting, it has been found that the estimated regular revenue for the next fiscal year, excluding income from public bonds, will reach ¥3,352,043,000, an increase of ¥275,232,000 compared to the estimated revenue for the current fiscal year. Because the planned revision of the tax system has not yet been decided, the estimate of tax revenue is still based on the current tax system. If the planned revised tax system is implemented, approximately ¥730,000,000 can be additionally collected, bringing the total regular revenue for the next fiscal year to ¥4,080,000,000. At the same time, the total amount of public bonds to be issued in the next fiscal year will exceed ¥5,000,000,000, of which ¥1,000,000,000 will be used to make up for the shortfall in the general budget, and ¥4,000,000,000 will be used for extraordinary military expenses. However, the review of these expenses is still in progress. Because some public bonds for the current fiscal year have yet to be issued, the Ministry of Finance will further tighten spending and strengthen financial control next year. The Ministry of Finance completed a preliminary organization of the budgets submitted by each province yesterday, and the ministry will begin reviewing the budgets of the Army, Navy, and other departments starting next week, reserving the final decision.

### Stalemate in Soviet-Finnish Negotiations: Soviet Demands Threaten Independence, Finland Declares No Further Concessions

Helsinki. The Moscow official "TASS News Agency" today issued a statement saying that the Finnish government holds an "uncompromising" attitude. The Finnish Foreign Ministry has specially responded, saying that the Soviet government proposed talks, and then put forward proposals that Finland believes threaten its independence and neutrality. Finland has already made considerable concessions on issues affecting Soviet security, especially in the Leningrad area, but given the nature of Soviet demands, Finland has no choice but to take preventive measures. (Reuters, 11th)

Moscow. The British "Daily Express" recently published a dispatch from Helsinki stating that Stalin had rejected Finland's latest concessions. TASS has been authorized to declare that this report in the "Daily Express" is completely inconsistent with the facts. It is found that Finland has not made any new concessions recently, so Stalin has no possibility of accepting or rejecting such a non-existent new concession. According to information obtained by TASS, Finland has not only not accepted the Soviet Union's minimum proposals recently, but has also reduced the possibility of reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Finland. Recently, Finland has dispatched two to three divisions of troops to the Karelian Isthmus, confronting Leningrad, and has now increased to seven divisions, expressing its uncompromising attitude. (TASS, 11th)

Helsinki. Finance Minister Tanner is now in Moscow, together with the Finnish Ambassador to Sweden, Passikivi, conducting negotiations with the Soviet authorities. He recently reported the progress of the negotiations to the government authorities by long-distance telephone. It is said that the representatives of both sides exchanged views with each other yesterday. It is still difficult to predict the outcome of the negotiations. In addition, the Finnish delegation has not yet continued to seek instructions from the government. As for the saying that the negotiations may be suspended, the official side has neither confirmed nor denied it. However, people here generally commented on the denial published by the Soviet TASS News Agency, and said that if Germany takes action against the Netherlands and Belgium, countries around the world will inevitably have no time to take care of the situation in the Baltic Sea, and the Soviet Union will inevitably re-exert pressure on Finland. (Havas, 11th)

Helsinki. According to Moscow news, Soviet-Finnish negotiations have not yet reopened. Yesterday, both sides exchanged memoranda, detailing their views, but did not determine the date for the resumption of the meeting. It is generally expected that the Finnish delegation will be recalled in the near future, and negotiations will be conducted through normal diplomatic channels. People here believe that the Soviet Union is attempting to prolong the negotiation time to change Finland's stubborn attitude. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)

Helsinki. The Finnish Foreign Ministry recently replied to the statement issued by the Soviet Union to Finland last night, stating that the Soviet-Finnish negotiations were initiated by the Soviet Union, and the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union in the negotiations were considered by Finland to be a threat to Finland's independence and neutrality. Regarding the security requirements of Leningrad, Finland has made concessions. At the same time, Finland has had to take various measures to protect its neutrality due to the Soviet Union's various demands. At present, the Soviet-Finnish negotiations seem to have reached a deadlock because the Soviet Union does not intend to resume contact with the Finnish representatives in Moscow. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)

### German Plane Attacks French Ship in English Channel: Two Bombs Dropped, Both Falling into the Sea

London. A French ship carrying more than ninety passengers was sailing from a French port on the English Channel coast to England today when it heard an air raid alert. Then a German plane appeared in the sky. The French anti-aircraft artillery immediately opened fire and drove it away. The ship also set sail. When it reached the middle of the journey, the German plane came back to attack, dropping two bombs in total, none of which hit. In an instant, three Allied destroyers from Britain and France flew to fight, and the German plane immediately fled. The ship was able to continue sailing. According to a passenger, "The German plane was circling above our heads, seeming to dive straight down and drop bombs. Fortunately, three British planes came to intercept it, and the German plane fled. Both of the bombs dropped by the German plane fell into the sea, one of which was only 120 yards away from the ship. The hull was not damaged. Our planes finally drove the German plane away. The sound of machine guns could be heard clearly." According to a female passenger, "Although the enemy plane attack was thrilling, all the passengers were able to remain calm, and some people whose cabins were below deck did not even know that the ship they were on had been attacked by enemy planes." (Havas, 11th)

### Ambassador Hu Shih Talks About World Federation

New York. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih took advantage of Armistice Day today to broadcast on the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, advocating the establishment of a world nation, taking the federal system, and the obligations and responsibilities must be extremely clear. According to Dr. Hu, the League of Nations in fact cannot serve as a league of Europe, which is the biggest fatal wound. An international government that cannot implement laws and order is an illusion. The future international government must be a supreme world federation. (United Press, 12th)

Chongqing. The Chinese branch of the International Peace Movement Conference today sent a telegram to Stimson, Chairman of the American Committee to Not Assist Japan's Aggression, and Aichibao, Chairman of the American Peace Movement Conference, stating, "Your tireless efforts for peace have deeply moved us. Although Ambassador Grew's speech in Tokyo was extremely appropriate, it is still necessary to continue to work to ensure that the U.S. position is thoroughly implemented, especially to impose sanctions on Japan, which has violated the treaty, and should not be easily let go.

The telegram was signed and sent by Shao Lizi, Vice Chairman of the International Peace Movement China Branch. (United Press, 12th)

### Self-Description of Japanese Officer Nakayama Yasutoku: Escaped While En Route to Daye, Surrendered to a Chinese Army Unit, Now Arrived in Northern Guangdong via Guilin

Shaoguan Correspondence. Nakayama Yasutoku, a Japanese officer who recently fought in Central China, escaped while en route from Nanchang to Daye, surrendered to a Chinese army unit, and has been escorted to northern Guangdong by personnel sent by the Southwest Guilin Headquarters, and has made several broadcasts. The following is a record of the Japanese officer's surrender and his experiences.

Nakayama Yasutoku, originally from Osaka, Japan, is 24 years old this year. He is a Japanese active-duty officer, with a resolute nature and a strong sense of justice. Since participating in the war of aggression against China, he has been deeply moved by the recklessness of the Japanese warlords and the intense war-weariness of the soldiers. He firmly believes that this Japanese military's invasion of China is extremely inhumane and meaningless, and will eventually lead to its own destruction. China's just resistance will surely win victory, so he is determined to surrender to the Chinese side, with the intention of reforming the motherland's society, overthrowing the Japanese warlords, saving the people of China and Japan, and seeking the true peace of East Asia.

According to Nakayama Yasutoku, he had a poor family when he was young. After completing compulsory education, he engaged in delivering newspapers, selling fish, and timber merchants, etc., working and studying at the same time, and completed the middle school curriculum. He also dabbled in legal studies, etc. He was once imprisoned for ideological problems. When he reached the age of military service, he was assigned to the "First Supplementary Military Service" and then incorporated into the "Active Duty." Not long after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he was ordered to enter the Army "Reserve Officer School." After graduation, he was assigned to the 8th Infantry Regiment. In less than a month, he was transferred to the 6th Regiment. On June 29th of the 27th year of the Republic of China, he went to Shanghai and then Ningguo, serving as the Second Lieutenant Deputy of the Intelligence Class of the Headquarters. After that, he participated in the battles of Huangmei, Guangji, Wuxue, Tianjiazhen, and the capture of Wuhan via Wuhu. On February 9th of this year, he received a secret order to participate in the Nanchang capture battle. On February 16th, while en route to Daye, he passed through Echeng, and took advantage of the darkness to escape from the Japanese army. Guided by local people, he joined the Chinese army.

At the beginning of his surrender to the Chinese side, he worked in the guerrilla team belonging to the certain war zone for two months. Then he worked under Commander Fan of the guerrilla team in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi for nearly a month, engaged in the guidance of guerrilla tactics, etc. Finally, because his original intention was to be in the revolution, he greatly admired the fame of the anti-aggression writer Rokuchi Wataru, and urgently wanted to meet him. So he went to Guilin via Changsha. He has been in Guilin for three months, engaged in anti-Japanese propaganda work and contributing opinions on anti-Japanese operations, etc. Therefore, considering his motive for joining the Chinese side, and after detailed inquiries by the Southwest Headquarters, observing his intentions, confirming that he was sincere.

According to general observations, the fact of Nakayama Yasutoku's surrender and everything he said can definitely prove that: (1) The Japanese army is already full of war-weariness and anti-war thoughts. (2) The Japanese warlords have lost their spiritual control. (3) Japanese officers and soldiers, feeling that the future of the war is unpredictable, the atrocities caused by their depression are becoming more and more serious. (4) China is definitely confident of final victory. Therefore, the Southwest Guilin Headquarters respects Nakayama Yasutoku's wishes and specially sends personnel to lead him to the front-line troops and the people in the rear in various war zones to make detailed broadcasts. (1) Provide opinions on anti-Japanese operations on the front line in person.

### Setbacks for Japanese Troops in Northern Jiangsu

Large-Scale Invasions Are Repulsed, Now Maintaining Only Local Disturbances

Xinghua Correspondence. Military affairs in northern Jiangsu have been quite quiet in the past two weeks. According to news from the military authorities, the Japanese army launched simultaneous attacks from all directions on the 2nd of last month, increasing their troops and deploying eight or nine planes and dozens of warships and motorboats. They originally intended to take Gaobao in one fell swoop, open up the canal line, and then capture Yancheng and clear the Fan Gong Dyke. Although the western route was fortunate enough to occupy Wodou, it also encountered a serious blow from the Chinese army, and the canal line was never opened up. The repeated gains and losses of Sishui and Jieshou are still in the hands of the Chinese army, so that the Japanese army failed to complete its original plan. Although the Japanese army on the eastern line advanced bravely, the Chinese army, in addition to giving them a head-on setback, also used strategic tactics to open up the front, transfer troops to both sides, and lure the Japanese army into the depths, allowing them to occupy the empty city of Yancheng, and then encircle and annihilate them. After the Japanese army sneaked into Yancheng, they regretted that their isolated army had entered a dangerous place, so they turned their heads and fled north. They were intercepted and pursued by the Chinese army, and their corpses were scattered all over the field. The Japanese army was almost completely wiped out, and their appearance was extremely embarrassed. Although the Japanese army in Huai'an repeatedly attacked Cheqiao, Fenggucun, Donggou, Yilinta, Ertou, Cuibao, and other places, they were all met with fierce resistance from the Chinese army and were defeated. Therefore, the Japanese army's attempt to capture northern Jiangsu failed to achieve success. So they send planes every day to bomb the Chinese army's various front lines and villages and towns at will to vent their anger, but it has no impact on the Chinese military. Therefore, in the past two weeks, the Japanese army has stopped large-scale offensives against northern Jiangsu and only maintained local disturbances.

### Shaanxi Righteous Church Bombed by Japanese Planes

Hanzhong. According to the Italian priests Chevallier and Bellotti to our reporter today, the Italian Catholic Church in Hanzhong was bombed by Japanese planes on October 25th and October 30th.

However, when Japanese planes bombed Hanzhong on October 30th, the church was hit by 20 bombs. Although no one in the church died as a result, there were five injuries. The church's nunnery and dormitory, which could accommodate hundreds of orphans, have been completely destroyed. The church's medical department was severely damaged. Now the buildings in the church have become a ruin. According to the two priests, there are no military targets around the church. When the Japanese planes bombed, the Italian flag was raised on the roof of the church, and its tall bell tower was enough to show that it was a church. (United Press, 12th)

### Situation of Chinese Army Progress in Guangdong Province: Northern Route Recaptures Many Strongholds, General Offensive on Dongbao Deployed, Qiongshan Recaptures Dongshan City

Hong Kong Correspondence. The Chinese army in Guangdong Province has recently planned a counterattack against the Japanese army, which has been basically determined. The regular army and guerrillas on all fronts have also taken the opportunity to operate. The following is a record of the recent situation:

Zengcong. The Chinese army on the Zengcheng and Conghua fronts in northern Guangdong launched a large-scale attack for days. On the evening of the 18th, Peng's division from Conghua attacked the area north of Zhongluotan from a certain place, sweeping away the Japanese army in the suburbs. The two sides fought fiercely for several hours. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and collapsed to the rear. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and continued to kill many along the way. At about 11:00, they charged into Zhongluotan. The Japanese army in Taihe City fought fiercely in the streets, and a large number rushed to reinforce along the road. The fighting continued until dawn. The Chinese army safely withdrew after completing its mission and continued to surround the Japanese army, waiting for an opportunity to strike again. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, dozens of guns were captured, and the Japanese military headquarters, power plant, radio station, etc. in Zhongluotan were destroyed. The Japanese side suffered heavy losses. Also, at 1:00 AM on the 18th, a certain regiment of Liang's division on the right wing of the Zengcong front attacked the Japanese army along the Guangcong Road. At about 2:00, they encountered the Japanese army at Baitianling. The Chinese army used hand grenades to destroy the Japanese barbed wire and charged into the Japanese position. The two sides then engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Subsequently, the Chinese army continued to join the battle. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was unable to support and retreated along the road to Shigang. Baitian then fell into the hands of the Chinese army. In this battle, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. On the evening of the same day, at 6:00 PM, a Chinese army commando team suddenly attacked Lianzhougang, Dunhexu, and other places one mile from the suburbs of Shigang, killing more than 40 Japanese soldiers and destroying many important Japanese fortifications. Now, the suburbs of Shigang are under the control of the Chinese army. As for the Huaxian area, the Chinese army along the Guanghua line has made continuous progress in the past week. The fighting in the suburbs of Longkou and Longxiang was fierce. On the morning of the 18th, the army artillery bombarded Longkou from the south of Huaxian and engaged in artillery battles with the Japanese army for about two hours. Then a certain unit of the Chinese army charged into the battle through the hail of bullets and successively recovered the strongholds in the suburbs of Longkou, besieging Longkou. The stalemate continued throughout the 18th. Many Japanese soldiers were killed. At dawn on the 19th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Longxiang along the Guanghua line. Because the Japanese army was unprepared, they were heavily charged and engaged in street fighting, killing more than 100 people. The fierce fighting was still going on at noon.

Dongbao. The Dongguan and Bao'an military bureaus have consulted on a general offensive plan, which has now been deployed. In recent days, Chinese army units have been frequently mobilized along the Guangjiu Railway, Wanzhang Road, Bulong Road, and Tangtian Road. The counterattack on Dongguan military affairs is presided over by Xiang Hanping, and the counterattack on Bao'an military affairs is presided over by Yu Zuzhang. Wang Ruozhou's unit of the Fourth Guerrilla Column has been reorganized and trained in rotation to become a mobile force, concentrated for surprise attacks, in order to launch guerrilla warfare. As for the Japanese and puppet troops in Wancheng, Shilong, and Taiping, three to four hundred people have been reinforced from Guangzhou and Xintang in recent days, with the purpose of assisting in guarding the strongholds. Chinese army guerrillas and detectives have sneaked into the inland areas of Wancheng, Shilong, and Taiping, waiting for the opportunity to move. In addition to the guerrillas, the self-defense groups gathered in various villages have also joined the battle, commanded by Zhang Wodong, the magistrate of Dongguan County.

At 1:00 AM on October 17th, the Liu Fayu unit of the first battalion of the Chinese army guerrilla team attacked the Japanese army at the Shengdu Ferry in Wancheng from the Wanjiang Ferry, and also attacked the Japanese army stationed at Xinglong Bridge from Rongshujiao. These two places are the outposts of the Wancheng Japanese army, used to guard against Chinese army attacks by water. At that time, there were only fifty or sixty Japanese soldiers at these two outposts, who responded in panic and reported to the Shimizu unit headquarters of the Japanese army in the city by wireless telephone. The two sides fought fiercely for about half an hour. The Japanese army retreated from Xizhuangmen into the city. The Liu unit took advantage of the victory to burn down the Japanese army's camp and pursued them to the Ximen Minjiao Hall and the main street outside the North Gate. The Japanese army had four machine guns deployed on each of the four city towers in the east, south, west, and north, and closed the city to defend it to the death. The Chinese army besieged the city along the walls. At dawn, they retreated to their defense area and will wait for an opportunity to launch another counterattack. Now, the major and minor traitors in Wancheng are extremely frightened and have secretly sneaked into the attached city. The puppet Dongguan County Magistrate Zhang Kouhong and the Japanese advisor Ishikawa have stayed deep inside and have not come out. In the past, the Japanese army would go to the countryside once every six days to collect taxes and extort chickens, ducks, fish, pigs, grains, and other items. Now, because they have been repeatedly attacked by Chinese army guerrillas and commandos, and are afraid of suffering losses, they dare not go to the countryside to collect them. The Japanese army in Wancheng has recently experienced a food shortage and is suffering from edema and beriberi. The houses in the park are used as hospitals.

Qiongya. The Chinese army on Qiongdong Island has inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army. They have continued to work hard in the past week. There has been continuous progress on the Chengmai and Qiongdong fronts. At dawn on October 12th, the 15th Regiment of the Chinese Army Security Forces attacked Dongshan City, which is located between Qiongshan and Chengmai. About 200 Japanese and puppet troops stationed there stubbornly resisted from within strong fortifications. The Chinese army first cleared the Japanese troops in the suburbs and then launched a large-scale siege of the city. The two sides charged several times and remained in a stalemate for a day and night. The Japanese army was gradually suppressed by the Chinese army and concentrated their main force to break through the encirclement and retreated towards Haikou. On the verge of leaving, they looted and set fire to the city. There are no Japanese troops in Dongshan City now. The Chinese army is appeasing the refugees and handling the aftermath. In this battle, forty to fifty Japanese soldiers were killed, and many military supplies were seized.

It is found that the Japanese army on Qiong Island has been constantly attacked by the Chinese army in the past ten days, and all fronts have reported defeats, showing a tendency to total collapse. The commander of the Japanese army stationed on Qiong Island, Major General Iida, has urgently telegraphed Guangzhou for help. Therefore, the Japanese army on Qiong Island has increased again in recent days. Several hundred Japanese and puppet troops arrived by transport ship on the 14th and 15th and landed in Haikou. In addition, eight Japanese warships have sailed to Haikoumen Bay to unload military supplies. These reinforced Japanese troops were all transferred to defend Haikou and Chengmai in western Qiong Island. As for the Qiongdong area, it is still maintained by puppet troops. At present, there are more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers, more than 500 war horses, and forty to fifty planes on the entire island. The Japanese army is afraid of attacks by the Chinese army guerrillas and dare not move out. All strongholds and important roads are covered with electric nets, and armored vehicles are used to transport sentries when they change shifts. The situation is embarrassing.

According to intelligence from military agencies, since the outbreak of the European War, the Japanese army occupying the Yulin Port area in Yaxian County has been actively deploying military vehicles. The airfield that was previously under construction near the port has recently been stepped up, and high-pressure tactics have been used to send Japanese soldiers to search for Chinese men everywhere, forcing them to work. The daily number of people is as high as 10,000, working day and night. All workers are given a living allowance of 3 military coupons per day, but the people hold a deep sense of justice and are unwilling to be used by the Japanese side. Therefore, villagers in Yaxian and other places have fled.

### Chinese Army in Dinghai Controls Four Townships in the Suburbs

Japanese Army Defends the City

Dinghai Correspondence. After Dinghai County Magistrate Su Bentshan was ordered to recover the county seat, he immediately convened political workers and outstanding youths in Dinghai to organize a war political work team to eliminate bandits and rogues, establish wartime primary schools, rescue wounded soldiers and sick people, and publicize the resistance against the war and the recovery of the city. The people, unable to bear the oppression of the Japanese, have also joined the army one after another, working together to recover the city. Recently, the General Headquarters of the ××× Army Group has appointed the ×××× Regiment to be transferred to Dinghai. Therefore, the Chinese army in Dinghai is strong and its offensive is huge. As a result, the 20 townships of Dasha, Baiquan, Xiaosha, Ganzhi, Jingtao, Cengang, Chaizheng, etc., and the major islands, are all under the control of the Chinese army. All the important roads in the townships are heavily guarded. As soon as the Japanese army leaves the city, they will be discovered by the Chinese army. A few days ago, several hundred Chinese soldiers led by County Magistrate Su went to the vicinity of Bei Zhi Temple to challenge the Japanese army in the city. However, the Japanese army kept the city gates tightly closed, tightened martial law, and did not dare to respond. The Chinese army threw leaflets with warnings to the traitors into the city and then returned to a certain township's defense area, waiting for an opportunity to launch another counterattack.

### Puppet Organizations Compete for Tobacco and Alcohol Taxes

Merchants Suffer Heavy Taxes, Deeply Feeling Unbearable Pain

Wuxi Correspondence. After the counties in Jiangnan were occupied by the Japanese army, the puppet organizations held various "tax affairs," such as the puppet provincial government's tobacco and alcohol tax and the puppet financial department's license quotas and other taxes, all setting up bureaus to collect taxes. As for tobacco and alcohol merchants who have silk tax goods in the puppet provincial bureau, if they are transported to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Anhui, and other places, they still have to pay taxes to the so-called "Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau." Because the two provinces of Zhejiang and Anhui are under the unified jurisdiction of the puppet tax bureau, and are not collected by the puppet provincial departments. The puppet unified tax bureaus in the occupied areas have respectively established the so-called "Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Branch Bureau XX District Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Branch Bureau," which mutually collect taxes with the Jiangsu Province XX Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau established by the puppet provincial government, each acting on its own and preventing the puppet provincial government from collecting tobacco and alcohol taxes. The puppet provincial government's financial department has repeatedly ordered the puppet branch bureaus in various counties to prevent the "Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Branch Bureau" from collecting taxes, claiming that they have received orders from the puppet executive yuan. As such, the two sides compete for each other, causing tobacco and alcohol merchants to pay two taxes on one item and are unable to bear the pain.

### Suzhou Dongting Mountain: The Evil Deeds of the Puppet Organization

Blatantly Levying Exorbitant Taxes

Suzhou Correspondence: The western part of Dongting Mountain, Suzhou Prefecture, with a circumference of over eighty li, is an isolated island in Tai Lake. The people in the mountains are simple and honest, mostly making a living by raising silkworms and fishing, which is enough to keep them fed and clothed. After the area fell into enemy hands, a scoundrel named Qin Panshi colluded with the puppet army under Cheng Wanjun and, relying on Cheng's power, organized the bogus Xishan Restoration Committee in a state of anarchy. He appointed himself as the chairman and committed all kinds of evil deeds, forcibly occupying married women, kidnapping people for ransom, and extorting from door to door. Anyone who slightly disobeyed was subjected to poison. Furthermore, he levied exorbitant taxes on the local fish, shrimp, and vegetables, taking thirty percent of everything. The villagers are extremely distressed and eagerly hope that their fellow villagers in Shanghai will find a way to relieve their suffering.

### Chao'an Puppet Organization Celebrates While Chinese Army Teams Launch Surprise Attack; Six Japanese Camps on the Chao-Shan Line Destroyed

Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese troops invading Chao-Shan have suffered repeated attacks from the Chinese army in the past month. On the evening of October 25th, the Wang Battalion of the Sangpu Mountain Security Team attacked the Japanese troops at Yonghou Bridge, located in the central section between Anbu and Shantou. At the same time, the Chinese army's plainclothes teams dug up six sections of the railway from north of Anbu to Huamei Station, isolating the Japanese troops stationed at Anbu, Baolong, Chuanlutou, Zhuanglongshan, Anbu City, Taiheshi Malong, Wenli, Longxi, and Neilong, preventing them from receiving external support. The Chinese army then burned down six Japanese camps in one night, killing and wounding more than 150 Japanese and puppet troops with hand grenades. Fujita, the captain of the Japanese company stationed at Longxi Middle School, was seriously injured and was taken back to the Shantou Bo'ai Hospital on an electric boat on the 26th for treatment. The Japanese commander stationed in Anbu, Horino, arrested more than 1,000 nearby farmers the next day and forced them to repair the section of railway from Shantoa to Huamei. However, on the same day, the Chinese army of Anjie took advantage of the incomplete repair of the Chao-Shan Railway and launched a fierce attack on the western suburbs of Chao'an City. That day happened to be the establishment of the puppet Aftermath Committee of Miaocheng. Zhang Weichen, Zhou Zhizhen, and others held so-called celebrations in Zhongshan Park in West Lake. The preparatory office of the puppet Aftermath Committee was located in Diaoyoushe, built by Hong Zhaolin. At nine o'clock that evening, just as everyone was in high spirits and the banquet had not yet ended, Chinese army teams sneaked into the nearby suburbs. With a signal, machine guns and bombs were fired intensively at the Jiuqu Bridge of Diaoyoushe, and the Japanese camp at the foot of West Lake Mountain was burned down, killing and wounding more than 130 Japanese and puppet troops. The Japanese troops in the city, caught off guard, suspected an internal mutiny and were on alert, daring not to leave the city. It wasn't until ten o'clock that the Chinese army, having completed its mission, retreated to Fengxi, its original defense position. On the 27th, the Wu Qiwai Department of the XXX Group Army of the Chinese side had approached the suburbs of Chao'an City. The Chinese army artillery positions on Zhugao Mountain remotely bombarded the Japanese artillery on Dongjin Bijia Mountain. From 9 a.m., the two sides exchanged artillery fire, the rumble shaking the mountains and valleys. In the evening, Chen, the commander of the Chinese army's advance team, led his troops to the vicinity of Yixi, destroying three Japanese transport vehicles with explosives, killing and wounding five or six people. On the morning of the 28th, the gunfire outside the northwest gate of Chao City became more intense, and pedestrians in the western suburbs were cut off. At night, only the sound of gunfire and the sound of autumn wind and autumn waves could be heard, causing the villagers who had not escaped to feel terrified.

### Kunshan Miscellaneous News

Oppressive Government Is Fierce as a Tiger; Popular Resentment Fills the Air

Rice Prices Soar: Kunshan Correspondence: Kunshan is a rice-producing area. In the past, when new grains were harvested, rice prices always tended to fall. Although this year's autumn harvest is still abundant, rice prices have continued to rise due to transportation difficulties, recently breaking the 20-yuan mark. The reason for this is that traffic between urban and rural areas is blocked, making it difficult for farmers to sell. The puppet county government also imposes heavy taxes and levies, extracting at every level. Rice merchants seize the opportunity to monopolize and hoard. Recently, smaller measuring instruments have been found on the market. These unscrupulous merchants only know how to make profits and disregard morality, which is truly heartbreaking to speak of.

Malaria Epidemic: Kunshan was a crucial location when it fell, resulting in many deaths. As a result, epidemics were rampant this summer, extraordinarily rampant. Since autumn, a type of malignant malaria has broken out, which is very dangerous. When the illness starts, there is only fever and no chills, and dizziness. Without continuous treatment, life is at risk. There are many patients, especially children. However, there are no sanitation facilities in the area, and the people do not know how to prevent the disease, so it is spreading very quickly.

Controlled Fish and Crabs: Kunshan is located near Tai Lake, and Yangcheng River crabs are sold to other places, which is especially important. Because the puppet county government's finances are stretched, it has not only stipulated taxes for crabs, shrimp, and fish but has also recently imposed controls on them to collect money. Therefore, crab prices have recently been very high, with the best ones costing about six or seven jiao per catty, several times more than in previous years. If you want to transport them to other places, you must first pay taxes at the fish market; otherwise, if you are caught, in addition to confiscating the goods, you will also be fined. With such a government, the people are filled with resentment.

### Funing Natural and Man-Made Disasters

Rascals and Bandits Commit Evil Deeds; Hurricane and Tsunami Arrive Together

Funing Correspondence: Funing is located by the sea. It was lost once last summer. When the Japanese troops retreated, most of the houses were burned down. When merchants and residents returned to the city, they could only temporarily set up thatched huts to do business. This spring, the Japanese troops occupied it again. A group of rascals, including Jiang Song, Zhang Lansheng, and Qian Xiaolaoshu, were used to organize a bogus maintenance association and sent people to find a director of funds to act as the puppet county magistrate. The director, Gu Jishi, had already gone into hiding, and the deputy director, Xiang Shaobai, had also joined a certain army. Jiang had no choice but to collude with bandits such as Zhu Baoyuan to disrupt the townships, raping, burning, and killing, committing all kinds of evil deeds. Although the farmers reluctantly plowed and planted, most of the harvested grain near the villages was robbed. Unfortunately, blessings never come in pairs, and misfortunes never come alone. A hurricane recently passed through, and the coastal areas of the third, sixth, and ninth districts were hit by a tsunami, flooding hundreds of villages and more than 5,000 households of all sizes. No one, whether humans or animals, was spared. According to a recent survey, 13,693 people, including the old, the young, men, and women, were drowned. It is impossible to investigate the number of those from other places. Those who survived have no place to live and no food or clothing. The sound of wailing is unbearable to hear. Now that the Japanese troops have collapsed from Chengkou, they are still coming to the villages from time to time to harass them. The remaining people are hiding everywhere day and night, being startled several times a night. It can be said to be a natural and man-made disaster.

### Special Charity Soccer Match: China United vs. British-French United; Today at 2:30 PM at the Racecourse; Changes in China United's Lineup

The first special charity soccer match of the season, China United vs. British-French United, will take place today at 2:30 PM at the Racecourse. China United has gathered the elite of the Lido and Donghua teams, while the United team combines the fighters from the Dongse, Lexifoss, and French Merchants Survey teams. With such a concentration of talent, the match is expected to be excellent. A large crowd at the Racecourse is expected. However, there may be temporary changes to China United's lineup. All substitutes must gather in the dressing room at the Racecourse before 2:00 PM today and bring black shorts and blue and white striped socks. The jerseys are white and will be distributed temporarily by the manager, Li Binjun. Sun Jinshun will continue to serve as captain. Tickets are priced at one yuan and six jiao. Except for news reporter passes, which are still valid as usual, all other long-term complimentary tickets are suspended. Referees, linesmen, and player managers must also enter the venue with specially issued tickets; otherwise, they must purchase tickets. The referee is Shen Huichun, and the linesmen are Mike Chetty and Herry. The lineups for both sides are as follows:

China United Team

Qin Bigao (Donghua Club)

Li Yichen, Zhuang Youren

Chen Qiguang (Donghua Club), Meng Yiliang (Lido Club), Jiang Zhaoxiang (Lido Club)

Cao Qiuting (Lido Club), Sun Jinshun (Lido Club Captain), Dai Linjing (Donghua Club), Xu Wenkui (Lido Club), Jia Youliang (Donghua Club)

Manager: Li Baojun; New Blood: Wan Xianghua (Donghua), Cai Shengsen (Donghua), Zhang Mingsheng (Lido), Huang Kehou (Lido), Yun Feng (Lido), Wu Qixiang (Lido)

British-French United Team

Bao Saizhong (French Merchants Club) (Captain)

Hailisun, Kelaitu

Maikesigan (Xifosi), Hailisun (Dongsele), Pankerai (French Merchants Club), Kelaitu (French Merchants Club), Xigelun (French Merchants Club)

Tangmusun (Xifosi), Dengken (Xifosi), Saidel (Survey Team), Mainaide (Dongsele), Shifeishi (French Merchants Club)

Manager: Gaxu; New Blood: Ximengsi (Lasike), Jiemuhuater (French Merchants Club), Hui'er (Survey Team)

Discussions on Changes to China United's Lineup: China United and the United team are evenly matched, making it difficult to make a definitive prediction. However, China United's five forwards are perfect, so their offensive power is certainly not comparable to that of the United team, and it will be difficult to counter their attack. Unfortunately, Xu Wenkui's leg injury has healed, but captain Sun Jinshun is injured again, and it is uncertain whether he will be able to play. Li Yichen may be moved forward to fill the position, with Chen Hongguang moved to the back, and Cai Shengsen filling the left forward position. Alternatively, the original lineup may be maintained, with Wu Qixiang joining the forwards. In short, temporary arrangements are still needed. With China United's wealth of talent, even with a few adjustments, it can still be seamless. According to the reporter's observation, Chen Hongguang's performance as a defender in the Donghua vs. Lido match was no less impressive than Li Yichen's. Li Yichen's performance in front of the goal is actually more dangerous than Hongguang's. Therefore, the reporter strongly advocates that the three strong players from Donghua stick to the defense. For this reason, now that Sun Jinshun is likely to be absent, moving Li to the front line and having Hongguang return to his original position is the most appropriate solution. Cai Shengsen is also a strong player in the midfield line and is not inferior to Meng Yiliang. Therefore, whoever plays in the center depends on proper arrangements. If Sun does attend, then I believe the following positions are the most appropriate:

Qin Bigao

Chen Hongguang, Zhuang Youren

Cai Shengsen, Li Yichen, Meng Yiliang

Cao Qiuzhe, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Xu Wenkui, Jia Youliang

Runner-up: Guan Youwen, Wei Junyao, Qing'an

The second Shanghai Open 17-mile Marathon Championship, organized by the Hongkou Cross-Country Team, was held at 7:30 a.m. yesterday on Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road.

Chinese general Liu Guangfa was bedridden with illness, and British expatriates Glymes and Hutson, and Russian expatriate Flying, were all absent, reducing the interest somewhat.

Today is the last day. Ms. Tan has many outstanding works on display, which are extremely wonderful. All visitors praised them.

Economic Supplement

### France's War Economic Power and Its Application (Continued)

— Class English

The Rise of Industrial Productivity

One of the reasons for the rise of France's war power is that the depth of the financial and economic policies of Reynaud was able to take advantage of the instability of international politics and the shakeup of the pound's position, thereby quickly resolving various domestic economic matters and finally getting on the track of development, reversing the past few years of anxiety and deep panic.

The main objective of Reynaud's policy was to induce the "return of fleeing capital." Therefore, he did not hesitate to adopt right-leaning policies, on the one hand reducing fiscal expenditures, and on the other hand ruthlessly increasing working hours. At the same time, he gave broad powers to Daladier to deal with the domestic turmoil. As a result, the anxious French economy was able to return to the path of development.

Judging from the business climate index, it has risen from 83 points in June of last year to 100 points in June of this year (according to S. G. F. survey, taking 1928 as 100%). The industries that have improved particularly well are mining, construction, iron and steel, machinery, and automobile industries. The number of unemployed has decreased from 345,000 in July of last year to 320,000 in the same period this year. The value of export trade has surged from 16.1 billion francs in the first seven months of last year to 20.9 billion francs in the same period this year. Consequently, the excess of imports over exports has decreased from 10.5 billion last year to a little less than 7.8 billion francs this year. As a result, the securities market is very prosperous. Comparing July of this year with the same period last year, the stock index has increased from 207 points to 234 points, and bonds have also risen from 76.5 points to 84.3 points. Even more noteworthy is the sharp increase in the gold reserve of the Bank of France. The reserve at the end of 1934 had fallen to 82.1 billion francs, and by the end of 1937 it had fallen sharply to 59 billion, but by the end of August last year, it had rapidly increased to 97.3 billion francs, exceeding the deposit amount of the past three or four years. From this, it can be seen how rapid and large the return of fleeing capital has been.

Ability to Procure Military Supplies from Abroad

Looking at France's international balance of payments over the years, it can be seen that France's overseas investments and overseas claims, as well as income from reparations, are one of the greatest cornerstones for building France's capitalist imperialism. Although France's foreign trade often has an import surplus, its interest income can often offset two-fifths to four-fifths of it.

The following is a table:

France's International Balance of Payments (Millions of Francs)

 	1935	 1936	 1937
Income	 6,350	 8,625	 6,705
Shipping, Insurance	 1,400	 1,800	 1,280
Travel Expenses	 750	 1,190	 1,300
Interest Income	 4,000	 5,375	 3,925
Expenditures	 6,750	 12,615	 10,700
Merchandise Import Surplus	 6,000	 11,675	 10,050
Remittances from Overseas Chinese	 750	 940	 650
Excess of Payments	 400	 3,990	 3,995
Visible
Capital Import Surplus	 ——	 600	 2,230
Gold Outflow	 ——	 29,500	 ——

This huge amount of funds possessed by France is usually a heavy burden on its socio-economic order. Because of its floating and instability, it often causes disturbances in finance. But in wartime, for France, which is poor in domestic resources, it is the most powerful condition for procuring overseas military supplies. According to the recent public announcement by Finance Minister Reynaud, France's gold holdings have reached a huge amount of 5,000 tons. Therefore, he is very optimistic about the prospects of a long-term war. His statement is as follows:

"France has a huge amount of gold to support a long-term war, which is more than enough. The Bank of France has about 2,500 tons in its treasury, and the Exchange Equalization Fund also has 500 tons. In addition, the funds deposited by French people abroad are between 700 billion and 1,000 billion francs, equivalent to about 2,000 tons of gold. The above totals 5,000 tons of gold, and the amount held by the people domestically has not yet been calculated.

"If necessary in the future, France can still obtain credit loans from foreign private individuals or governments. Regarding this, the financial agreement signed between Britain and France is sufficient to supplement the military and diplomatic alliances between the two countries.

"I recall that during the last European war, from 1914 to 1919, France's foreign trade, after offsetting imports and exports, lost an average of 13 billion francs per year. The total amount in five years was 65 billion francs. Among them, after deducting 8 billion for merchant shipping freight and insurance, 13 billion for foreign securities held by the French people, and 16 billion for the expenses of the Allied forces in France, totaling 37 billion francs, there was a deficit of 28 billion francs, an average annual deficit of slightly less than 6 billion francs. At the exchange rate at that time, 1,600 tons of gold were lost each year. Considering France's current resources, the prospects for a long-term war are indeed optimistic."

Formation of Wartime Economic System

After the outbreak of the European war, Britain repeatedly issued various emergency economic decrees, transforming the pre-war liberal economic organization and entering a strongly controlled wartime economic system. However, France was slower, and the market was not as tense as in London. However, the Lyon silk exchange once suspended trading on September 6; the foreign exchange and stock markets still operated as usual. General financial institutions also did not suspend business; the state still allowed them to be free and did not interfere.

Although the response of the French economy was not as profound as that of Britain, the Daladier government's deliberate calmness also contributed to this. The key to the success of Reynaud's financial and economic policies was, in a nutshell, to restore and maintain market order and to make fleeing capital return to the country. However, the returning funds have not been fully digested by the production sector; if the market wavers even slightly, there is still a danger of rushing to escape. The outbreak of the European war was a very serious situation. If Reynaud had immediately intervened extensively, it would have been enough to increase people's panic. This is why Daladier deliberately remained calm and why international trains resumed operation. The resumption of international trains stabilized market psychology. Once people's minds were settled, changing the economic structure would achieve the effect of guiding the situation. Therefore, the French government's emergency financial decrees, implementing exchange controls and interfering with gold trading, were not at the beginning of the outbreak of the war, but after the resumption of international train services on September 9, which is of profound significance.

Recalling the beginning of the alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union, the French government convened an emergency meeting on August 23, and immediately decided on more than ten important plans, the main ones being to conscript 600,000 reserve soldiers, to recognize and implement various military decrees to deal with the final stage of the peace, and to grant independent power to Daladier. The next day, it promulgated a wartime requisition order, and immediately requisitioned city cars for military use; then, on the one hand, it cut off the railway between Germany and France, and on the other hand, it implemented a requisition order for the national railway. On the same day, it implemented restrictions on the use of metal products. On August 28 and September 1, it issued import and export prohibition decrees. On September 2, both houses of parliament unanimously passed a wartime emergency budget of 69 billion francs, and at the same time abolished the Bank of France's regulations on maintaining a 35% cash or foreign exchange reserve rate for issuance. On the 4th, it implemented the nationalization of gold policy. It extended military working hours to 72 hours per week. On the 9th, it promulgated emergency financial decrees. On the 10th, it prohibited soy sauce exports, managed foreign exchange transactions, and prohibited gold trading. Later, it successively promulgated bills such as "limiting profits" and "controlling prices." It can be seen that Reynaud had already formed a plan for the construction of the wartime economic system and was already gradually implementing it. (End)

### The Past Week

The exchange rate suddenly turned back to contraction, and finally loosened again. It is said that the reason for the "contraction" was stimulated by the "Japanese puppet regime's prohibition of the import and export of legal tender." The reason for the relaxation is that the customs authorities and the diplomatic corps and foreign merchants stationed in Shanghai firmly refused and protested. This statement seems reasonable. In fact, it is nothing more than speculators having an excuse to take advantage of the situation and stir up trouble for their own benefit. The depreciation of legal tender on the black market was too excessive, and the price of foreign goods rose to the point where importers were idle. This is the fundamental reason for the past prolonged relaxation. The outbreak of the European war, the return of funds from overseas Chinese, the floating of export bills, and the large households rushing to sell at low prices are the triggers for the continued relaxation. There is no end to the relaxation, and speculators are suffering from the lack of opportunities. The Japanese puppet regime is jealous. Therefore, one, although knowing it is ineffective, still takes action; the other, although knowing it is ineffective, also takes the opportunity to disrupt. Ineffectiveness is ultimately ineffectiveness, and the result is still relaxation. "Relaxation" has a solid foundation, and "contraction" is just a method of grasping at shadows. The question is only when can it be "relaxed and stable"?

The cost of living index for workers in this city in October decreased by 12.36% compared to September. The common people have therefore received a lot of comfort. But if you study it carefully, only fuel and food have decreased. Clothing and miscellaneous items are still rising. In today's colder weather, clothing merchants can indeed take advantage of the situation. But the facts show that high prices are of course unfavorable to the lives of ordinary people; they are also not good for industry and commerce themselves, and will only make the market decline day by day. In the current environment in Shanghai, it is impossible to revive and develop industry and commerce; but it is also urgently needed to be able to stabilize it. Therefore, the current problem lies in stabilizing prices. At this time, on the one hand, we pray that the various trade associations will organize price stabilization committees to curb speculation and manipulation, and do our best to dredge the sources; on the other hand, we hope that the people will automatically save and use more domestic products. However, we should strictly oppose the conspiracies that borrow the beautiful names of "price limits" or "storing grain to prevent famine" to implement the reality of "stimulating the market" and "facilitating price increases." At present, there is only one way to ensure the livelihood of the common people. One is to ask the impartial concession authorities to handle "price stabilization" and "storage"; the other is for citizens to unite and implement consumer cooperation, and first organize it between employers and employees of commercial firms and factories.

It is said that the National Government is preparing to allocate 50 million yuan to implement factory bombing insurance. This is a decision of the Senate. For a country, it is an urgent matter to implement bombing insurance during wartime. Everyone knows that in modern warfare, economic weapons are even more important. Destroying one more factory will cause the country to lose more strength in terms of strength. Therefore, during the war, the country should do its best to protect factories. In the past, although factories were in dangerous areas, they could not insure against bombing with insurance companies, because the private insurance companies would not do this loss-making business. Therefore, after being bombed, only the factory owners suffered losses alone, and indirectly affected the country's wartime industry. Now, if the government runs factory bombing insurance, any factory can receive compensation immediately after being bombed by Japanese aircraft, and rebuild or repair the factory, so that it can be restored to its original state in a short period of time. This not only protects the factory owner from losses, but also indirectly maintains the country's wartime strength. Therefore, we earnestly hope that factory bombing insurance can be realized in an instant.

Mitsui & Co.'s recent rush to buy eggs has its own reason for disregarding its image: this is due to the lack of food and nutrition on the Japanese front lines, which has greatly damaged morale. Mitsui is just acting on orders. But what is the use of "grabbing"? Eggs are laid by hens. Only because the Japanese army eats chickens wherever they see them in the occupied areas, there is an egg shortage. This is even worse than killing chickens to get eggs. In fact, the reason for the egg shortage is not the only one. The famine of pork, beef, grains, cotton, silk, etc. is also the same reason. If Japanese financial groups want to plunder the Chinese market and raw materials, they will support the warlords' armed invasion of China. As a result, the Chinese market becomes poorer and the supply of Chinese raw materials decreases. Contrary to their wishes, they want to rely on the "control" method to carry out aggressive plunder; as a result, the production in the occupied areas declines and the purchasing power withers. Because the Chinese army cares for the people's difficulties, it has not fully implemented the "scorched earth" policy. These actions by the Japanese puppet regime will not help us complete the purpose of "scorched earth". Retribution will not be far away.

### China's Economy Since the Outbreak of the European War

— Yu Xielin

The impact of the European war on China's economy has been very beneficial, as can be seen from the facts of the past month. People should now stop making unconscious speculations and discuss the impact of the European war on China and the future trends based on reality. The following is a detailed analysis of the impact of the European war on China's economy over the past month:

(1) Favorable Foreign Trade China has a vast territory and abundant resources. Although it has lost a lot of land, the free areas still have endless treasures. China is particularly endowed with important products such as tung oil, pig bristles, and Pu, etc. Although transportation is inconvenient and transportation is difficult, the export of these products has increased year by year, and has now become the pillar of the war of resistance economy. The United States has always been the main customer of tung oil. Although the European war has broken out, it has not reduced its exports; the same is true for other special products. Because the European war has broken out, overseas consumption has greatly increased, which is enough to increase the export volume of these products. Therefore, it is heard that the exports from the free areas in September have also increased.

In the occupied areas, there was a surprising import surplus in the first eight months of this year, but since the outbreak of the European war, Shanghai, which is famous for its import surplus, has also become an export surplus. This shows that the world's countries are in urgent need of Chinese raw materials, fearing that the supply will be insufficient. Therefore, the future of China's foreign trade is very optimistic.

The following is a discussion centered on Shanghai's trade.

Since the outbreak of the European war, the trade between Britain, France, and Germany and China has been greatly affected due to shipping relations. Shanghai's import trade in September has therefore decreased sharply, and exports have increased greatly due to the increase in US sales. Therefore, the Shanghai Customs has become an export surplus again. The export surplus reached a huge amount of 1,719,000 yuan in legal tender, which is a phenomenon of improvement in China's economy.

Among the exported native products, the export of textiles has increased significantly, reaching a huge amount of more than 19 million yuan, accounting for the top spot in exported goods. Piece goods, yarn textiles, and knitted goods, as well as other textiles, also have a huge export volume, totaling more than 20 million yuan. In terms of raw materials, animal and animal products also have an export volume of more than 10 million yuan, and minerals, metals, and miscellaneous grains and tea also have a large export volume. It can be seen that during the European war, what the world's countries rely on from our country is not limited to raw materials. And light industrial manufactured products are also among them. In Shanghai's exports, light industrial manufactured products have reached more than half of the total export volume.

In terms of country, Shanghai's foreign trade situation is the United States in the first place. Shanghai's exports to the United States in September were more than 20 million yuan. In terms of imports, Japan is second, followed by Britain and Germany. In terms of exports, Hong Kong is second, followed by Britain, and then French Annam.

The total export volume of Shanghai Port in September reached more than 66 million yuan. If the whole country is considered, the number is even greater. Such a huge number is probably an impossible dream for pessimists. This time, China can still export such a large amount during the war of resistance, which shows that China's productivity has unlimited development prospects.

(2) High Exchange Rate Since the outbreak of the European war, it has been more than a month, and the foreign exchange price in Shanghai's black market has continued to rise. Since August, the price of three and a half pence has risen to more than five pence, and the US exchange rate has risen from 6.25 yuan in August to 8 yuan now. This is indeed a good phenomenon during the war of resistance. Looking back at Japan, the exchange rate of the US dollar fell by 10% at the outbreak of the European war. Why can our country rise by 25% at this time? Studying the results, we have obtained the following factors.

In the past, speculators believed that the future of legal tender was pessimistic, so they scrambled to buy foreign exchange, which caused the exchange rate of legal tender to fall from 8 pence to 3.5 pence in three months. This time, the European war broke out. People generally have an uneasy psychology about the British exchange, so they threw out the British exchange. They all thought that the US exchange was safe, and some also improved the US exchange, but they were very sensitive. However, the price of legal tender in the New York market gradually increased, so the US exchange in the Shanghai black market also rose. Recently, due to the story of Xiangbei, the foreign exchange black market has risen even higher. Therefore, speculators have gradually become disheartened about foreign exchange and spit out foreign exchange violently, thus creating the highest price in three months.

Since the outbreak of the European war, exports have increased sharply, and Shanghai has had an export surplus of more than 10 million yuan in September, so the supply of foreign exchange in the black market has also increased a lot.

Recently, the Hong Kong gang's violent dumping in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market is also the main reason for the increase in foreign exchange. Since Hong Kong promulgated the foreign exchange control order, all commercial activities have been restricted, so they have flocked to Shanghai. During this European war, although it still does not have the ability to attract a large amount of fleeing capital to China, the inflow of overseas funds cannot be said to be non-existent.

From the above facts, it can be seen that China is in an absolutely advantageous position during the European war. The increase in exports is enough to promote the revival of China's economy, and it can obtain a large amount of military supplies to strengthen the front-line combat power. The high exchange rate is enough to increase the credit of legal tender. It can be seen from these two that the Japanese's coastal blockade, destruction and occupation of China's national industry, and the policy of obtaining foreign exchange to make legal tender collapse are only in vain.

### Silk Tea October New York Raw Silk Consumption Increased Sharply

This year's silk market has seen a rapid rise due to the impact of rising prices of various commodities. The highest record for Yokohama spot in October was 1960 yuan, jumping out of the previous month's highest price of nearly 300 yuan, more than doubled the highest price of 840 yuan in the same month last year. The reasons for this have been mentioned in this publication from time to time, and the most important one is the outbreak of the European war in the world, and the destruction of the inherent production order due to the war in the Far East. In this evolution, production has shrunk, prices have soared, and speculation has risen. Some commodities have thus created an unprecedented boom, which is not limited to raw silk. The statistics of New York silk in October show that progress has been made in various items of inventory, sales, and imports, which proves that the price of New York silk still has a practical basis. The import volume in New York in October increased by 10,464 dan, sales increased by 4,989 dan, and inventory increased by 8,175 dan. This month, Shanghai silk imports increased by 458 packages, and Guangdong silk increased by 20 dan. The statistics are recorded on the left (unit: dan),

### Commemoration of the Fall of Shanghai Today: All Circles Further Encourage and Inspire Themselves; The Painful Impression of This Day Two Years Ago Has Not Faded; The People's Beliefs Will Never Change

Today (the 13th) is the second anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai. All circles in this city are solemnly commemorating it, but without lowering the flag. According to what happened the morning of November 10th two years ago, after the Japanese troops landed in Pudong, they contacted the Japanese troops in Puxi and surrounded Nanshi. Although the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River were blocked north of the blockade line, they frequently fired artillery shells toward Nanshi to assist in the attack. Japanese aircraft in the sky also continuously dropped bombs. The Chinese troops only retreated at 4 p.m. on the 13th. After the Japanese troops entered, the prosperous areas of Nanshi were completely enveloped in fire, with flames soaring into the sky, resembling a fiery hell. Thousands of city houses were tragically destroyed, and the losses were incalculable. The Japanese side is very concerned that the mobile Chinese troops in the suburbs will launch attacks to demonstrate on this anniversary, so various places are carrying out anxious preparations. The details are as follows:

A Sea of Ruins, a White Void

This month's 13th is the second anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai, which is also the last day the isolated army held Nanshi. The prosperous areas inside and outside the Nanshi city walls along the towns on the Pudong coast turned into rubble in three days of fire. Moreover, in the occupied areas, even bricks and tiles are being controlled, and recently, even intact houses have been dismantled and sold after the great fire, resulting in tens of thousands of ruins and a white void. The semi-refugee-like people in the Nanshi area recalled the scene of abandoning their homes and belongings, supporting the old and carrying the young, and taking refuge in refugee areas two years ago. Comparing their current miserable state with the era of peaceful and prosperous life, they cannot help but feel extremely sorrowful.

Special Precautions Implemented in the Suburbs

The Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai are deeply concerned about a possible surprise attack by the Chinese troops, so they plan to station troops one by one in all important land and water areas in the suburbs of Shanghai, and assign large units of Japanese and puppet troops to patrol in designated areas. All pedestrians, vehicles, and ships will be subject to strict inspection. Every Japanese and puppet soldier has a bayonet on their rifle, and they sometimes aim with loaded guns, as if facing a formidable enemy.

Strict Searches in Hongkou and Other Areas

Along the bridges north of the Suzhou River, in areas guarded by Japanese troops, the number of Japanese soldiers increased from two to four yesterday morning, and to five or six in the afternoon. In addition, the Japanese Consulate has added two special policemen to each bridge. In addition to strictly checking pedestrians' passes, they are also subjected to thorough body searches. Anyone who does not comply is immediately detained and questioned. The procedures for searching pedestrians at the Waibaidu Bridge, Zha Pu Road Bridge, and Sichuan Road Bridge are particularly harsh. Although there are no Japanese troops stationed on the roads in Hongkou, there are many car patrols and army patrols coming and going. These precautions will continue to be implemented today.

Japanese Troops Hastily Adding Fortifications

Since the situation in the suburbs of Shanghai became tense, the Japanese troops have been extremely panicked, easily alarmed, and frightened several times a day. Starting the day before yesterday, more than a dozen Japanese soldiers at the railway crossing on Hongqiao Road dismantled the sand fort and rebuilt it, using cement and aggregate as the base and red bricks for the walls. By yesterday morning, it had been built two or three feet high. Their working condition was very hasty, and their anxious state was constantly revealed. A few bungalows to the west and south have been used as puppet police stations.

### Those Who Host Guests for Pro-Japanese Individuals Must Report It; Police Department Has Ordered Wanli to Suspend Business for One Week Due to the Bloodshed Case

According to the Shanghai Times, after two members of the "Self-Defense Corps" in the Western District were assassinated at Wanli Restaurant, 514 Fuzhou Road, on Thursday night of last week, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has ordered the restaurant to suspend business for one week starting yesterday (the 11th). It has been learned that the Police Department had previously issued a notice to all restaurants in the Public Concession that if Japanese or pro-Japanese individuals hold banquets at the restaurants, the restaurants should report to the police authorities. Upon receiving the report, the Police Department will send special detectives to the restaurant to prevent accidents. The Police Department believes that Wanli Restaurant did not comply with this order, so it ordered the suspension of business for one week yesterday as a warning. According to reports, there have been shootings in restaurants such as Guanshengyuan in recent weeks.

### Overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia Remit Money Back to China

Totaling Approximately 20 Million Yuan in July and August Alone

Overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia have significantly increased their remittances back to China, breaking all previous records. According to the amount of remittances to Quanzhou and Yongchun counties in July and August, the amount of remittances is equal to the total amount of remittances in the past five months. The amount was 4 million yuan per month in the past, and the total amount for five months was about 20 million yuan. The amounts for July and August were about 10 million yuan each, more than two and a half times the usual amount, which is a rare good phenomenon in history and greatly benefits the war of resistance economy.

### Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond the Border: The Puppet Side Raises a Counterproposal; In addition to Police Power, There Are Other Requirements; Detailed Content to Be Kept Secret by Both Parties

Regarding the dispute over road construction beyond the border in Puxi between the Shanghai Public Concession's工部局(gōng bù jú/Municipal Council) and the puppet municipal government, Mr. Fessenden, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, and Mr. Phillips, the Director-General and Chief Executive, visited the puppet mayor Chuan Xiaonan on the 2nd of this month and made suggestions. At that time, Chuan stated that he would give it serious consideration. It is now learned that Chuan returned to visit Mr. Fessenden, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, at 5:30 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 11th) and handed over a counterproposal from the puppet municipal government regarding the suggestions of the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council is currently unwilling to disclose the content. It is understood that Fessenden and Chuan Xiaonan had agreed during their last meeting to strictly keep the content of the suggestions and counterproposals secret until a hypothetical agreement is reached by both parties, at which time it can be announced. Therefore, the Municipal Council is maintaining a firm attitude of silence regarding the proposed suggestions and the content of the puppet side's counterproposal. An official from the Municipal Council also stated that he cannot comment on the counterproposal raised by Chuan at this time. However, the Municipal Council has decided to study the puppet side's proposal starting today and then reopen negotiations.

Municipal Council Officials Have Not Leaked Information

According to the Continental Daily, Chuan Xiaonan, the "Mayor" of the regime under the wing of the Japanese side in this city, raised several counterproposals to the Municipal Council last night (the 11th) in the hope of resolving the dispute over road construction beyond the border related to the "Great Way" police patrolling the main roads of the Western District. A reporter recently asked a senior official of the Municipal Council about the nature of the counterproposals. The response was that, given his position, he cannot disclose the nature of Mayor Chuan's suggestions at this time. It is said that officials of the Municipal Council decided during their last conversation with Chuan that disclosing any information about the suggestions and counterproposals of both sides would be detrimental to the negotiations. Therefore, they decided not to disclose such information until a satisfactory agreement has been商得試騐(shāng de shì yàn/negotiated and tested). Last night, it was heard that Municipal Council officials would begin studying Chuan's counterproposals next week. According to the North China Daily News, Chuan Xiaonan visited Mr. Fessenden, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, at 5:30 p.m. yesterday and handed over his counterproposals.

Puppet Police in Puxi Tolerate Robbery

According to the North China Daily News, at 8 p.m. on Friday, a British woman had just gotten off a public bus on Yuyuan Road and was walking west on Dingpan Road when she was about to enter an alley to her residence. Suddenly, a Chinese man snatched her handbag from behind and ran off to a nearby alley on Yuyuan Road. The British woman immediately shouted for the police to chase him and reported to two armed Chinese policemen in制廢(zhì fèi/uniforms) of the "Special Municipal Government" nearby. It is said that the two Chinese policemen did not provide any assistance and seemed unaware that the British woman was calling for their help. Therefore, the robber easily escaped into the "Special Municipal Government" area south of Yuyuan Road and has not been caught as of yesterday (the 11th).

### The New Jiangnan Steamer Almost Caused a Major Disaster

The German-owned Xin Jiangnan steamer loaded passengers and cargo from Ligang outside Zhenhai Port on the 2nd of this month. Because the ship was very small, it encountered wind in the Tongsha waters outside Wusong Port. All six tugboats broke their cables and drifted away, almost causing an accident. Therefore, the ship will no longer sail to Ligang after returning to Shanghai and has now changed to the Beisha line.

### Yesterday Commemorated the Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Birth: Citizens Were Extremely Excited; The War of Resistance Has Entered a Favorable Stage; The Blue Sky with a White Sun Emblem Was Everywhere

Yesterday (the 12th) was the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. Although there was no commemorative ceremony in this port due to the special environment, the citizens reminisced about the founding achievements of the late Sun Yat-sen. At a time when the War of Resistance has entered a favorable stage and national liberation is in sight, they were particularly excited. Yesterday, the solemn and glorious 青白國微(qīng bái guó wēi/Blue Sky with a White Sun emblem) fluttered in the wind on the streets and rooftops, and was everywhere. The citizens' love for the country and their firm emotions to work hard to complete the great cause of resistance and construction and carry forward Sun Yat-sen's遺敎(yí jiào/testament) were evident everywhere. All circles spent this festive day in a solemn and calm宅氣(zhái qì/atmosphere), with everyone taking their efforts in their own positions as a commemoration of the birth of the Founding Father. Details of the various situations are recorded as follows:

The Blue Sky with a White Sun Emblem Flew Throughout the City

Starting yesterday morning, all stores and residents in the two concessions uniformly hung the 青天白日滿地紅(qīng tiān bái rì mǎn dì hóng/Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth) national flag, fluttering in the wind, creating a new atmosphere. The citizens' patriotic emotions arose spontaneously. The reporter passed 爱麦虞限路(ài mài yú xiàn lù/Avenue Edward VII) yesterday morning and saw many painted national flags posted on the walls and telephone poles along the road, which were obviously the work of elementary school students. Although the skills were childish, the feelings of those who saw them were even more excited. Yesterday was a Sunday. Except for the Municipal Council and various银钱业(yín qián yè/banking) firms, which will take a day off today as usual, the four major banks, including the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, will be open as usual. The post office, customs, courts, and schools will also not take a day off.

The Precautions Were Not Tense

Yesterday, the authorities of the two concessions, in addition to increasing the number of Chinese and foreign detectives patrolling the streets and searching suspicious pedestrians and vehicles, the bridges over the Suzhou River were unobstructed. The general situation was no different from the past. On roads such as 福履理路(fú lǚ lǐ lù/Ferry Road), 拉都路(lā dū lù/Route Doumer), and霞飞路(xiá fēi lù/Avenue Joffre), slogans and leaflets such as "Support the National Government" and national flags were distributed, but no disturbances occurred. The precautionary measures in the area of road construction beyond the border in Puxi were also no different from the past. The Japanese and puppet sides implemented special precautions in the suburbs.

The First District of Hebei Silently Celebrated

The first district of Hebei, north of the Suzhou River, has been劃入(huà rù/included) in the Japanese military警備(jǐng bèi/garrison) area. Under the low pressure, the stores and residents along 北江西路(běi jiāng xī lù/North Jiangxi Road) did not hang flags. The citizens silently commemorated this day, but remotely looked at the flags flying in河南(hé nán/south of the river), and deeply felt that the scene was completely different across the river. The Japanese troops stationed at the缺口(quē kǒu/gap) of 北江西路(běi jiāng xī lù/North Jiangxi Road) were extremely strict in checking pedestrians entering Hongkou. The night before, they also mobilized to 北河南路(běi hé nán lù/North Henan Road)东段(dōng duàn/east section) for deployment. A police 警備(jǐng bèi/garrison) vehicle and many detectives from the police station were stationed west of the 北江西路(běi jiāng xī lù/North Jiangxi Road) 文監師路(wén jiān shī lù/Wenshi Road)缺口(quē kǒu/gap) to carry out precautions.

### Issuance of National Conscription Certificates; Establishment of Checkpoints

Any Man of Age Without a Certificate Will Be Sentenced to Detention and Forced into Military Service

In order to improve military service, the Ministry of Military Affairs will issue national conscription certificates, which will be implemented starting next year.

### British Naval Tug Leaves Shanghai to Return Home

Already Sold and Now Re-Leased; May Need to Sail to India Midway

According to the Continental Daily, the sea-going tugboat "Suisey", which is responsible for rescue work, weighs 579 tons and is 155 feet long. It was built by the British Admiralty in 1918 and sold to a company in Shanghai after the war. Now it has been re-leased by the British Admiralty and left Shanghai last Sunday, taking the Suez Canal to England. The entire journey will take ten weeks, but it may not sail to England and be recalled to India to engage in

Special Work

The current captain of the ship is Mr. Searle, a British man who has been coming and going on the Chinese coast for a long time. Another British man on board is the chief engineer, Mr. Lloyd. Both of them used to belong to Jardine Matheson. The crew members are Chinese recruited in Shanghai. It is expected that after they arrive in England, they will be sent back to China. The "Suisey" has sailed long distances. In addition to coming to Shanghai from England after the war, it sailed from Shanghai to the west coast of Australia in 1936, only stopping at Samarinda to add fuel and drinking water.

On the Way Back to Shanghai

The "Menduro"轮(lún/steamer) was towed along. Although it encountered bad weather repeatedly, no accident occurred. It is also said that another tugboat built by the British Admiralty, the "St. Bloke," will also 起椗(qǐ dìng/weigh anchor) to England in a few days. The statement that the "St. Bloke" is actually the "Caroline Moller" wheel of the Moller company has been denied by a British Admiralty officer stationed in Shanghai. It is said that the tugboat participated in British naval exercises in Weihaiwei this summer, and its name is also "St. Bloke." According to reports, the wheel was built in China in 1920 and is 135 feet long.

### Principal and Interest on Matured British Gold Bonds Have Been Deposited into a Special Account; The Eleventh Principal Repayment of 69,000 Pounds Sterling; Principal and Interest Have Been Delivered to HSBC Bank for Collection and Payment

In order to complete the supplementary construction fund for the Yuehan Railway, the National Government issued British Gold Bonds of 6% interest in June of the Republic of China year twenty three (1934) by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the Ministry of Railways, totaling 1.5 million pounds sterling. At that time, it was issued at 96% of the face value. It was stipulated that principal and interest would begin to be drawn for repayment every six months starting January 1st of the Republic of China year twenty four (1935), in twenty-five installments, until January 1st of the Republic of China year thirty six (1947), when the principal and interest would be paid in full. It was designated that the funds borrowed by the Ministry of Railways from the British return of the Boxer Indemnity would be used as the fund. These bonds were underwritten by HSBC Bank and others. The eleventh drawing will be held at the Banque Belge pour l'Etranger in Shanghai on December 1st. A total of 69,000 pounds sterling will be repaid. It is scheduled to be paid by the four banks, including the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and HSBC, on January 1st of next year. It is heard that the principal and interest due for the eleventh repayment have been allocated by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications and delivered to the British HSBC Bank and others, and deposited into the account of the Committee for the Custody of the Remaining British Gold Boxer Indemnity Bonds, for special storage and payment. This is sufficient proof that the Chinese government's commitment to maintaining credit has remained unchanged, which has won the trust of bondholders at home and abroad, and the prices of Chinese government bonds in domestic and foreign securities markets have rebounded.

### Jews in Shanghai Mourn Their Persecuted Compatriots

According to the Continental Daily, after Ernst vom Rath, the Secretary of the German Embassy in Paris, was assassinated by a Jewish youth last year, the most violent anti-Jewish riots in the history of the Third Reich occurred on November 10.

Since its implementation, all sectors of industry, commerce, and culture have enthusiastically participated, and the results have been very good. By the end of last month, it was close to the quota. Later, the Solicitation Association notified that the national cold weather clothing solicitation would be extended to the end of November this year, and the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth was designated as the second general mobilization solicitation after National Day. All circles in this city continued to donate as much as possible, in order to achieve the goal of doubling the donation at the end of this month.

### Japanese Elementary School Teacher Poisoned in Hongkou

Severe Vomiting and Diarrhea

Guan Kou Jianji, Jia Teng Jiangying, and other seven teachers who were receiving training at the Japanese Elementary School Teacher Training Center established by the Japanese side at the Tongwen College in Xujiahui went to the Japanese 休餐室(xiū cān shì/rest room) on North Sichuan Road in Hongkou for dinner at noon the day before yesterday (the 10th). Unexpectedly, they were poisoned and vomited severely. The Japanese side is very　注意(zhù yì/concerned) about this. Guan Kou and others are still being treated in a hospital in Puxi.

### Attitudes of Various Countries Turn Stronger; Kato Achieved Nothing; England, France, and the United States Have No Possibility of Accepting and Recognizing the New Regime; Resolution of the Road Construction Beyond the Border Issue May Be Expected

According to foreign sources, since Japanese envoy Kato arrived in Shanghai, he has been conducting continuous inquiries with the authorities of England, the United States, and France, taking the maintenance of the interests of various countries in China as an exchange condition, and asking whether the various countries have the possibility of recognizing the puppet "New Regime." It is heard that the authorities of the countries believe that this matter is of great importance and that all negotiations should be handled by their respective governments and cannot be resolved locally, and have politely declined. The Far Eastern policies of the aforementioned countries have not only remained unchanged recently, but have also gradually become tougher. They will naturally not accept any conditions for this new regime that cannot be recognized internationally. Also, regarding the issue of road construction beyond the border, it is generally believed that a temporary agreement can be reached to avoid friction, and that the fundamental solution must be handled by a legally legitimate government that is internationally recognized.

### Record of Lang Jing-shan's Photography Exhibition

— Fang Feng

If you first admire Mr. Lang Jing-shan's photography and then meet the man himself, you will inevitably feel quite surprised.

Mr. Lang Jing-shan has the gentle demeanor of a Confucian scholar, is very reserved in his manner, speaks with order and reason, and dresses in an old-fashioned style. Even his every move does not resemble that of a city dweller. You might think he is a scholar, a university lecturer, and you would never know that he possesses such skill and lofty artistic conception in photography. However, Jing-shan's accomplishments in photography are not accidental. He has accumulated many years of experience, coupled with continuous effort, and maintains constant contact with photography circles in Europe and America. This allows him to keep pace with the times and achieve his present success. Last month, when Aurora University commemorated the centenary of the invention of photography by Daguerre, it held a photography exhibition. Mr. Ferguson said that we should not commemorate Daguerre in an empty and superficial way. We should follow Daguerre's spirit—that is, emulate his spirit of painstaking research. Mr. Ferguson also said that a person like Lang Jing-shan truly possesses the spirit of Daguerre.

Jing-shan regards photography as an art form, seeking artistic interest beyond the rigid function of recording images. He transforms the mechanical into the artistic. He is able to convey the artistic conception of Eastern art onto photography, causing people to have a wonderful and direct intuition when they see it. We often say, "There is poetry in painting, and painting in poetry." This means that painting can evoke the flavor of poetry, and writing poetry can evoke the realm of painting. This kind of skill can only be achieved by famous artists. However, the "both poetry and painting" artistic interest on a small piece of paper can only be found in Jing-shan's photographic works, which possess this style.

Today, Jing-shan is publicly exhibiting his works from his recent tour of the Southwest in the art gallery on the fourth floor of the Da Xin Company. All proceeds from the ticket sales will be used to help refugees. Local English newspapers, such as the North China Daily News, the China Press, and the Shanghai Times, have all published two-page special supplements dedicated to Lang's works. This is an honor for Chinese photographers and is worthy of great praise.

Yesterday at dusk, the author, along with Xu Ze-ren, Zhang Ruo-gu, and Hu Dao-jing, met with Jing-shan in a quiet room in western Shanghai and had the opportunity to preview the exhibits for today.

It was truly dazzling and hard to put down. We felt as if we had taken a trip to Sichuan. Among these many works, we saw the sea of clouds on the summit of Mount Emei, like flying catkins and seawater, with precipitous cliffs that were breathtaking. The uniqueness and beauty of Mount Emei are different from those of Mount Huang. We also saw the Chongqing Beibei Hot Springs, where Chairman Lin appeared to be floating like an immortal in front of the Milk Flower Cave. The background was the hot springs, like mist and smoke, reflecting the vines hanging from the cliff stones, which were quite antique. As we looked at the paintings, we listened to Jing-shan's narration. At the same time, we also boated on the Jialing River, enjoying the beauty of the Little Three Gorges. In these pictures that were both poetry and painting, we admired the small boats traveling on the Jialing River, a group of haulers like the Volga boatmen, and the waterfalls with trickling streams. Afterward, we saw the scenic spots of Jin Yun Temple and Shao Long Temple, and the statues of Shanmu Yuan. Then, from Chongqing, we traveled to Chengdu, where, of course, the Wu Hou Temple, the Wen Shu Monastery, the Qing Yang Palace, the Shao Cheng Park, and the Xue Tao Well were all displayed before our eyes. These historical and valuable scenes were very harmonious, beautiful, and natural.

Li Bing, the Prefect of Qin and Shu County, governed the water in Guan County, using the six-character principle of "dig deep the riverbed and build low the dikes." For thousands of years, there have been no more floods. On the Min River, there is the An Lan Suspension Bridge and the Li Dui, both relics of Li Bing's water management. The great achievements of our ancestors are truly astonishing. Mr. Lang has photographed all these historical sites, filling us with infinite emotion. The most lovely is the An Lan Suspension Bridge, which is like a famous painting. Mount Qing Cheng is also in Guan County, where you can see fir trees and the misty clouds on the mountain peaks.

Jing-shan also has in-depth research on the inscriptions. For example, "Lonely Boat in the Evening Gorge," "Sunset over Mount Wu," "Dusk in the Cold Forest," and "Early Morning in the River Village." Although these sentences are only a few words, they are very vivid and to the point. The author loves to see landscape paintings, especially paying attention to the inscriptions. I remember a landscape painting by Lin Qin-nan that had a donkey rider walking on a mountain path. The artistic conception was very lofty. When I looked at the inscription, it read, "Walking near Sword Gate, chanting becomes even more bitter, each journey a mountain scene, each journey a poem." At that time, everyone who appreciated it was amazed, believing that both the poetry and painting were exquisite. Now, seeing the photography with inscriptions by Jing-shan, I also have the artistic conception of reading paintings from years ago.

People suffocating on the isolated island, you should not be discouraged, especially today, the second anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai. You cherish the free China and miss the entire vibrant Southwest. Today, you should visit this meaningful photography exhibition with enthusiastic hearts. Undoubtedly, you will be able to see Sichuan as if you were in the embrace of the motherland.

Finally, it should also be mentioned that the China Travel Service has recently published "Scenic Spots of the Southwest." This book includes all the works that Jing-shan is exhibiting today, as well as photographs of Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces. All the vibrant aspects of the Southwest are presented before your eyes. This book is also on sale at the venue today.

We wish Mr. Lang success in this photography exhibition, and we also hope that everyone will appreciate it, because the ticket sales will be used to help refugees.

elucidate legal principles

Specifically, they jointly initiated the organization of the Shanghai Lawyers Association Judgment Interpretation Research Association. This organization was first proposed by lawyer Xu Zuo-liang. After the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association, including Yuan Yang-an, submitted a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval and registration, it was actively pursued. Lawyers in this city all supported this type of organization. Therefore, Yuan Yang-an, Xu Zuo-liang, Yu Cheng-xiu, Yu Zhong-luo, Ge Zhi-qin, Wang Xiao-wen, Tao Ran, Jiang Yi-ping, Chen Ting-rui, Wu Zheng-yue, Qu Yue, Wang Wei-zhen, Sun Zu-ji, Yang Si-cheng, Zhu Wen-de, Li Wen-jie, Zhang Zheng-xue, and over eighty others, gathered at the Hong Mian Restaurant on Rue Edouard VII at around 7 PM the night before. They held the inaugural meeting of the Judgment Interpretation Research Association on the spot. At that time, lawyer Yuan Yang-an was elected as chairman, and Ma Li-jiang was the recorder. First, lawyer Xu Zuo-liang reported on the significance of organizing the Judgment Interpretation Research Association, stating briefly that the judgments of courts at all levels and the legal interpretations of the Judicial Yuan or the Ministry of Judicial Administration are the criteria for justice and are directly related to the rights and obligations of the parties concerned. The right or wrong of the reasons, or the existence of a crime, indirectly provide reference for judges and lawyers to cite and apply. Therefore, it must be based on fair inquiries and correct interpretations, and in terms of law, there is a natural and perfect beauty so as not to lose its

assigned mission

Otherwise, the meaning is biased and the situation is difficult, and there is a sense of dissatisfaction with the modern spirit of justice. Although the foundation of judicial solemnity is based on independent trial, which no agency can interfere with, the interpretation of judgments on the one hand represents the exercise of legal power by the state, and on the other hand confirms the actions and facts of the parties concerned, with significant implications for the degree of seriousness. We study it due to the needs of legal principles and case circumstances, which is also a contribution in the academic field. Upon investigation, in modern legal systems, judges, prosecutors, and lawyers are the three major functions in justice, and the spirit of justice is expressed through the practice of these three major functions. For example, when judges and prosecutors hear or prosecute cases, lawyers must appear in court to defend and elucidate legal principles, which embodies the meaning of balance and assistance in careful handling of cases. Currently, many scholars in Europe and the United States comment in detail on the judgments of courts at all levels and publish special collections. This not only promotes the evolution of legal principles, but also serves as a warning to some judges who rely on their legal status and do not take responsibility. At this point, Chairman Yuan Yang-an read out the Judgment Interpretation Research Association passed by the Executive Supervision Committee of the Lawyers Association.

Organization Outline

A total of eleven articles and detailed rules of procedure consisting of four chapters and twenty articles, were all passed. Six groups of candidates were nominated on the spot, including 28 people in the Civil Law Group, such as Zhang Zheng-xue, 20 people in the Criminal Law Group, such as Chen Ting-rui, 16 people in the Civil Procedure Law Group, such as Yu Zhong-luo, 15 people in the Criminal Procedure Law Group, such as Yu Cheng-xiu, 12 people in the Commercial Law Group, such as Wang Xiao-wen, and 8 people in the Miscellaneous Law Group, such as Qu Yue. It was also decided that the Judgment Interpretation Research Association would have five secretaries and three alternate secretaries. Each group would have one leader (i.e., convener), all of whom would be elected by the Standing Committee of the Lawyers Association using prepared ballots through postal voting. During the dinner, lawyers Li Wen-jie, Sun Zu-ji, Wang Xiao-wen, Wei Wei-qing, Wang Bo-xian, Chen Ting-rui, and others spoke in succession, all of which were to elucidate the essence of legal principles. They lectured while drinking until 9:30 PM, when they dispersed.

### Committed Numerous Evils, Died of Illness in Prison

Zhu Zhang-bao, a Suzhou native residing at No. 5, Fuxing Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, who was 51 years old this year, engaged in various servile activities after the August 13th Incident in order to seek great profit. On February 27th of last year, he lured Wu Wang Xiu-juan, the wife of a friend from Ningbo, under the pretext of recommending her to work in a galoshes factory, to gather in Hongkou, and transported her by car to Hangzhou to be used as a prostitute for the entertainment of the local garrison for profit. The woman, unable to endure the suffering, managed to escape and, after many twists and turns, came to Shanghai. She then filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Zhu Zhang-bao of procuring her as a prostitute and disrupting public morals, requesting that he be severely punished according to the law. The presiding judge considered the case to be serious, so he first detained Zhu for investigation. As a result, he considered Zhu's criminal circumstances to be heinous and sentenced him to a heavy punishment. Zhu refused to accept the sentence and repeatedly appealed, but all appeals were rejected. He was then sent to prison to serve his sentence, which has been for a year and a half. Now, Zhu died of pulmonary tuberculosis in the Special No. 2 Prison. Medical treatment was ineffective, and the prison authorities reported the death to the prosecutor of the Special No. 2 Court for verification. His wife signed a guarantee to claim the body for burial. Those who do evil will meet such an end, which should be a warning to those who come later.

### French Police Strictly Arresting Drug Offenders

Famous "Bai Xiang" (local toughs) Chen Zhang-lin, Wu Wan-liang (nickname "Big Monk") from Jiangbei, and others colluded with Korean vagrants to set up morphine dens in various streets and lanes, making huge profits, while countless people were victimized. In the past ten days, the French police have uncovered dozens of such dens. Among them, the den at No. 15, Hengmao Lane, Ba Xian Qiao, was the largest in scale. According to the confessions of the arrested criminals, all drug dens in the concession were controlled by Chen and Wu. Therefore, the police have ordered a strict manhunt.

### Ball Toss Injures Crown Crowd, Big Fire This Morning, Fire Breaks Out in the Warehouse of Da Zhong West Drug Store, Three Women Severely Burned, Six People Injured in Falls

House number 5 in the Crown Crowd neighborhood of the Ball Toss arena on Nanjing Road, rented by Da Zhong West Drug Store, with a distribution department set up there. The owner of the store is Li Cheng-jiu. Due to having extra space, he sublet the second floor and mezzanine to a certain aunt and sister-in-law from Ningbo. At around 1:10 this morning, just as it was late at night and everyone was asleep, a fire suddenly broke out in the room where medicinal materials were stored. Because the medicines helped to fuel the fire, it quickly spread and became uncontrollable. The general residents, alerted by the police, woke up from their dreams, but the only ladder in the house had been burned down. As a result, six men and two women on the second floor jumped out of the windows, injuring six people, including one woman and five men. All suffered head injuries, fractures, and broken bones. The three women in the mezzanine did not escape. At this time, the Central Fire Brigade had already arrived in vehicles to put out the fire and rescue those in the surrounding areas. Meanwhile, firefighters erected a ladder and rescued two middle-aged women and a young woman, only eighteen years old, from the fire, but all had been burned and were unconscious. The injured nine men and women were rushed to Renji Hospital by ambulance. Among them, the three women burned by the fire were in critical condition. As there was no one in the drug store at the time, there were no injuries. At the same time, the Central Police Department also sent detectives to suppress the situation and investigate the cause of the fire. The fire was gradually extinguished until about 2 AM. The cause of the fire is still unknown. However, according to general reports, the store had a fire four or five months ago, so today's fire is the second time. The address of the store owner is still under investigation.

### Social News

Huang Yu-qiu, an eleven-year-old girl from Jiangbei, was struck by a No. 7 tram at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road yesterday morning, crushing her abdomen, and her intestines spilled out. She died tragically on the spot.

Chen Tao-shi, a 30-year-old woman from Wuxi residing at No. 77, Hengde Lane, No. 452, Xujiahui Road, quarreled with her husband, Chen Jin-ren (33 years old), over her four-year-old child the day before yesterday (11th). After people persuaded her to stop, she became depressed and had a sudden suicidal thought. She took poison at home at midnight that day. Neighbor Cao Yong-yuan discovered it and sent her to Nanyang Hospital at No. 1, Avenue Dubail. Due to severe poisoning, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at noon yesterday.

At around 6:45 PM yesterday, five bandits suddenly broke into a certain estate at No. 26, Lane 688, Beijing Road, to rob. Two of the bandits were armed with guns, and they confined everyone in the house and forced them to hand over the keys to the silver cabinet and other important items. They were allowed to search and loot freely. As a result, the total value of the property stolen was more than 3,000 yuan, and they escaped.

### Letter

To the editor of Shen Bao:

Yesterday, I read a news article in your newspaper about the death of Chen Lin-shi from poisoning. The part about me is inaccurate. When Chen Lin-shi was brought to the hospital by her brother, I refused to accept her because I saw that she was already dead and could not be saved. I did not give her two injections of a stimulant. During the autopsy, I was summoned for questioning by the police, not sent to court. This concerns the reputation of the doctor, so please correct this immediately to avoid misunderstandings.

Sincerely,
Doctor Shen Ding-yang
November 12th

### Using Astrology and Evil Arts to Defraud Others of Money, Shi Kong-yu Defrauded of Over 60,000 Yuan, Yang Xia-min Still in Custody Pending Detailed Investigation

Yang Qia-min (also known as Di An Le-tian), a native of Wuxi and owner of the Wei Li Duo MSG Factory at No. 131, 4th Floor, Hankou Road, is proficient in astrology. In the first month of the year before last, through the introduction of Zhang Zi-wei, he cast a horoscope for Shi Kong-yu, a Ningbo native engaged in the stock exchange business. He predicted that Shi would die in September. At Shi's request, he agreed to use the method of "connecting to life energy" to help him resolve the crisis. The method was to set up an altar to worship the gods, and to offer the gods cash and banknotes as a way to suppress evil spirits. In the process, Yang repeatedly used trickery to swindle Shi out of

cash offerings

To date, the cash he offered to the gods amounted to no less than tens of thousands of gold. Yang ordered the paper package of cash to be stored in the vault of the Jin Cheng Bank, claiming that the life energy had been successfully connected, and Shi's life would be safe. After that, Yang and Shi became close friends. Shi also invested tens of thousands in the Wei Li Duo factory under a pseudonym, and guaranteed loans for Yang to the bank. Recently, Yang saw that Shi had run out of money, so he used the same method to swindle Shi's wife's jewelry. At that time, Shi's wife was also deceived by him and

remained in the dark

Recently, when she needed to use the jewelry, it had all been turned into blank paper. Yang's scam was exposed. After reporting to the General Police Department, Chinese detectives Jiang Shang-pei and Yang Pei-sheng arrested Yang and sent him to the Special No. 1 Court for interrogation and detention. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Last Saturday, Judge Dai Rong-duo continued the trial in the Criminal Division 4. Shi Kong-yu also hired lawyers Wu Lin-kun and Xiao Bai-chuan to appear in court and file a civil suit, calculating that Yang had defrauded him of investment guarantees, bad checks, and other expenses, totaling

sixty-eight thousand

More than yuan, requesting that the defendant be ordered to compensate him. Police lawyer Qian Xun-jiu detailed the fraudulent methods of the defendant Yang Qia-min (already detailed in previous reports, omitted). He also stated that in the adjournment, the police went to the Jin Cheng Bank vault to open the paper money that Yang had offered to the gods, and found that it was all blank paper and ghost money. The police also seized a large amount of his money in the defendant's office, which shows that the defendant used his astrology to swindle money from others. It is

undoubtedly true

It was also found that the defendant had committed many other similar cases in addition to defrauding Shi Kong-yu, which have not yet been verified. Therefore, he requested permission to postpone the investigation for further investigation. Then Shi Kong-yu submitted a complaint detailing how Yang Qia-min defrauded him of money, invested in the Wei Li Duo factory, guaranteed loans to the bank, and how Yang used post-dated checks to pay off debts. In response, Yang Qia-min

partly admitted

Otherwise, some claimed that it was a loan nature, etc., Dai's car verified and the supply was made to Yang for detention, and the retrial was adjourned for one week. He heard that those who were defrauded of money by Yang in the same way included Xu Wen-xing (Zixing), 16,000 yuan, and Zhang Jing-wu, 14,000 yuan.

Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Transportation

### Premier's Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Transportation

— Meng Bai

Yesterday was the Premier's birthday, which reminded me of the Premier's life. In his private life, he was very frugal. He only knew how to work for national affairs, and material enjoyment was not on his mind. In this regard, we can see it from all aspects of the Premier's clothing, food, shelter, and transportation. I will briefly describe the Premier's clothing, food, shelter, and transportation below, based on the reference books, newspapers, and photos.

Clothing In his early years, the Premier always wore long robes and small hats. Later, he ran around for national affairs and fled overseas several times. In addition to wearing Chinese clothes, he also wore Western suits. In the 21st year of Guangxu, when the Premier was 30 years old, he led his comrades to attack Guangzhou as a base and opened Qianheng Bank in Yao Port as headquarters, and established an agricultural society in Guangzhou. However, on September 9th, due to careless transportation of weapons, the matter failed, and Ling Hao-dong and others all died. The Premier went from Guangzhou to Hong Kong via Jian Road and crossed to Japan, and then cut his hair and changed his clothes to revisit Honolulu to promote the Zhonghe Society. This is also a memorable page in the history of the Premier's clothing. In his later years, he often wore casual clothes that were a modified version of Western suits, which is now called the Sun Yat-sen suit. When the Premier took office as the Provisional President in the first year of the Republic of China and as the Grand Marshal of the Army and Navy in the sixth year of the Republic of China, he wore the clothing of the President and Grand Marshal, respectively. It is especially worth mentioning that the Premier's clothing was mostly made of ordinary silk cloth, not expensive fabrics.

Food The Premier was very casual about food, whether Chinese or Western. He only sought to fill his stomach and did not seek abundance. Moreover, when discussing major issues and planning military and party affairs, he often forgot to eat, day and night. He thought that saving the country was more important than eating!

Shelter The Premier's hometown is also Hengcun, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, which everyone knows. There is also a self-built house there, but because he was born in a farmer's family, the house has the scenery of a village house and a farmhouse. Later, the Premier left his hometown and ran around for the revolution. Although he served as Provisional President and Grand Marshal, he only had a foreign house on Molie Avenue in the French Concession in Shanghai, and no other houses. It is said that even this foreign house was given to him by others.

Transportation Regarding the aspect of transportation, we can divide it into two ways of speaking. In terms of walking, the Premier was also very casual and did not necessarily have to sit in an expensive car. He would take ordinary boats and cars. If there was something to do, he would immediately go and do it without hesitation. In terms of behavior, he advocated the theory that it is easy to do what is known to be difficult. Therefore, he only worried about not knowing the urgency. As soon as he knew what should be promoted and reformed, he would move forward with a fearless spirit.

### Clothes That Resist Mustard Gas

— Lu Li Shi

When the European War first broke out, Poland and Germany had a fierce battle. Although Warsaw, Poland, was occupied by the German army, this was not a disgrace to the Polish people. It was entirely because the German government took the great risk of releasing mustard gas. When the super-era killing weapon descended on the heads of the Polish people, the Polish soldiers, whose tactics and weapons were not weak, could only accept the tragic order to retreat.

Mustard gas is the demon king of poison gases. It not only damages people's respiratory organs, but also corrodes the skin. When a mustard gas bomb is launched from a gun or an airplane, it immediately turns into smoke-like gas and spreads everywhere. Soldiers can only prevent contact with it by wearing an airtight suit—a suit that resists mustard gas.

Professor Bullart of Hobart University in New York, USA, invented a medicinal juice that can resist mustard gas. Clothes soaked in this medicinal juice can absorb mustard gas and make it lose its toxicity. That effectiveness can last for several months. In addition to wearing this kind of clothing, soldiers must also bring gloves, headscarves, and special leather shoes. If the Polish army had been equipped with this kind of anti-gas clothing earlier, perhaps Warsaw would not have been lost so easily. But what is that kind of medicinal juice called? Because the United States government attaches great importance to this invention, which is a military matter, it cannot be publicly released for the time being. One day, mustard gas will become a waste product. Look! The demon king's strong enemy.

### Anecdotes About Crabs

— Qiu Lang

Holding a crab and raising a cup is one of life's pleasures. In this crisp autumn season, it is the time when rice fields are fragrant and crabs are plump. Therefore, gourmets are carrying them to the market in strings to buy wine and fill their plates with seasonal delicacies. Although there are many refugees and impoverished people on this isolated island, even facing food shortages, those with money are keen to enjoy their own culinary delights first! As for crabs, because they have many legs, sharp claws, and move sideways, they are generally used to symbolize the fierce and tyrannical. Moreover, because their actions are not upright, it is believed that they cannot last long, hence the warning: "Let's see how long you can scuttle sideways!" However, the thoughts of poets are different; they interpret and express pity for the crab: "Knowing that grain-eating creatures are originally innocent, but what else can one do about their delightful taste before a wine pot?" This is entirely for the sake of culinary desires! I will not criticize this further but recall one or two anecdotes to amuse the readers.

The Qing dynasty person Li Meian, was nicknamed "One Li, Hundred Crabs." One explanation is that he could eat a hundred crabs in a meal, which shows a great appetite, but I doubt it is true. As for famous crab painters throughout history, there are indeed many. The most ingenious was a certain painter (some say it was Li Meian) who was skilled at painting crabs but charged high prices. He required one gold piece for each crab, paid in advance. A certain gentleman thought his price was too high and negotiated for half the price, giving him five gold pieces, and commissioned him to paint ten crabs. The painter reluctantly agreed. The next day, when he went to collect the painting, he saw that the ten crabs were positioned with only half of their bodies exposed, along the edge of a jar, leaning against a stone, or in the grass. The gentleman accused him of cheating, but the painter calmly replied, "Isn't half a crab worth half a price? I painted five crabs for five gold pieces, as per the previously agreed price. How am I cheating?" The gentleman silently retreated.

Legend has it that in olden times, farmers in a certain place feared crabs as if they were deities, daring not to catch them and unaware that they could be eaten. Therefore, the crabs roamed freely in the rice paddies, eating most of the grain. The farmers reported the famine to the county magistrate. After the magistrate inquired about the appearance of the pests, he ordered them to catch as many as possible and bring them to the yamen. Soon, the yamen was piled high with baskets of crabs. The magistrate further instructed the cooks to boil them and serve them to the staff for a feast. The farmers were amazed—and then the people of that place all followed suit and began to eat crabs. This story may seem like a humorous tale, but customs vary from place to place. Compared to the food of inland China and the uncivilized regions of the Miao and Man peoples, there is a great difference. Therefore, it is possible that the people of a certain place in the past did not dare to eat crabs, or it could be a true story.

### Bamboo Branch Verses on Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Sun Choucheng

Mr. Jianzhong of Wuxi, who loves to compose poetry, compiled "Echoes in the Lake." After seeking refuge in Shanghai, he founded Hongdao School, teaching tirelessly. Recently, seeing how difficult it is to live in Shanghai, he composed "Bamboo Branch Verses of Shanghai," divided into four sections: "Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation." Although they are playful works, they accurately depict the suffering of living on this isolated island. They will appeal to those who have the heart. I am reprinting them in this publication to share with readers: (1) Frequent war disasters bring endless suffering, ten houses are empty, nine of them are empty, cotton prices are high and sleeves are thin, how will we resist the autumn wind? (Clothing) (2) Drifting on an isolated island, a guest's lament, the high prices of everything are alarming, rice is like pearls and firewood is like cassia, a stone of yellow flour costs forty gold. (Food) (3) Sheltered in the foreign concession, a temporary paradise, rent for a single room is twenty yuan. I have a home but cannot return, sighing in sorrow. (Housing) (4) The journey inland is full of hardships. Donating money to get a certificate is the only way to travel, who knows if the paper is real or fake, you still have to be careful of being slapped. (Transportation)

### A One-Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Pig liver seems like a very ordinary thing, but according to doctors, it has very nourishing properties and is beneficial to the body. Therefore, if you can't think of any meat dishes every day, then eating some fried liver oil is not only economical but also nourishing. The most common way to cook fried liver oil is to chop pickled mustard greens into small pieces and stir-fry them in a pot. Although it doesn't have any special flavor, it's still quite tasty with rice. If you use freshly pickled cabbage instead of pickled mustard greens, it will taste even more refreshing. If you don't like oil and eat pig liver on its own, then steam it, slice it thinly, and mix it with soy sauce, sesame oil, and celery, it's also very delicious. In addition, chicken liver and duck liver have the same effect as pig liver, and their taste is naturally better than pig liver.

### On the Evolution of "Transportation" in Our Country

— The Editorial Department

The need for transportation is shared by humans and all animals. However, humans cannot fly with wings like birds, run on four hooves like beasts, or swim with fins and scales like fish. Therefore, if there were no roads or the creation of means of transportation, human movement would be hindered everywhere by nature, and there would be no smooth progress. At the same time, human culture would never be able to develop. Therefore, progress in transportation has a great relationship with the progress of world civilization. Now, I will discuss the evolution of transportation in our country:

First, let's talk about land transportation. In the early nomadic era, people already knew how to use livestock and manufacture vehicles. As the "Book of Origins" says, "Fuxi began to ride oxen and horses, and made whips and sticks to dominate. Xuanyuan made carriages and roads, and Shaohao made ox carts." At that time, the roads were just natural paths on mountain trails or plains. By the Zhou Dynasty, the government had officials in charge of roads throughout the country, and they divided the roads into five types: "path, border, coating, road, and highway." A path could accommodate oxen and horses, a border could accommodate large carts, a coating could accommodate one carriage, a road could accommodate two carriages, and anything that could accommodate three or more carriages was called a highway. At the same time, carts were also divided into many levels based on the number of horses pulling them. When Qin Shi Huang unified the six kingdoms, he wanted "to make the tracks of carriages uniform throughout the world, and the script the same." Therefore, he built major roads throughout the country. Jia Shan said, "Qin built roads to all parts of the empire, reaching Yan and Qi in the east, and Wu and Yue in the south. All the views along the rivers and seas were reached. The roads were fifty paces wide, with trees planted every three zhang, and thickly built on the outside." At the same time, he also dug the Jianmen Plank Road to connect to Bashu. The achievements of this ambitious man in the history of transportation in our country cannot be denied. Then, during the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Wuhou opened up the ancient Sichuan-Yunnan road. By this point, it can be said that the east-west and north-south land transportation throughout the country was fully prepared.

As for water transportation? It also existed in the earliest times. The "Book of Changes" says, "Hollowing out wood to make boats, carving wood to make oars." This is the dugout canoe that barbarians used to hollow out wood with fire, which was of course very crude. Later, it was improved many times. The "Book of Origins" says, "Zhuanxu made poles and oars, Emperor Jun made tugboats, Yao made mooring ropes, Xia Yu made tugs… Wu Zixu made war junks." By this time, the form of boats and oars was complete. Some people even slightly modified boats and oars to become floating bridges, which are called "building bridges with boats." As for the construction of real bridges, it didn't happen until the Warring States period! The improvement of boats and oars also had great achievements. For example, the war junks of Wang Jun of Jin who went down to Yizhou, and the giant ships of Zheng He of Ming who crossed the South Seas, are both famous in history. The waterways from the Sui Dynasty Emperor Yang's opening of the Ji Canal, the Hangou Canal, and the Grand Canal, also facilitated transportation a lot.

The above all discuss the situation in our country during the era of isolation. As for modern times? Since the nineteenth century, Fulton in Europe and America invented the steamboat, Stephenson invented the train, and the Wright brothers invented the airship. Thus, in addition to land and water transportation, there was an increase in air transportation. All these means of transportation—steamships, steamboats, submarines, trains, automobiles, trams, airships, balloons, airplanes, etc.—were introduced to China. At the same time, railways, highways, and tramways were built, and neither high altitudes, towering mountains, nor great rivers can be obstacles to "transportation." However, compared to European and American countries, there is a world of difference. This is what our people should strive for. But after reading the newspaper recently, I know that the central government plans to develop the Great Southwest, and is currently building railways and highways, which is enough to make us very happy.

Spring and Autumn

### Two Years

— Huang Ziqiang

Two years! It has been two years since the fall of Shanghai! But that tragic and exciting scene will be forever engraved in my heart and deeply imprinted in my mind forever.

It was the day of the European Peace Commemoration. I attended the memorial ceremony in front of the Statue of Peace on the Bund and returned, but in Nanshi, a stone's throw away, the prelude to resisting the invaders was unfolding.

Nanshi, this ancient city, is the most familiar place of my birth and growth! Since I was able to understand that I was a person, I remember that the alley where my family lived was the most lovely alley. It ran through Zhonghua Road and Zhaojia Road, but a stranger from outside would never know that this was the most convenient shortcut. Even rickshaw pullers who understood shortcuts could not pass through this small alley because of the wooden stakes blocking the entrance. Thus, this small alley was our children's free world. Playing football and kicking shuttlecock would not be disturbed by vehicles, and what made us most happy was hiding from each other, letting the other person pass through the two main roads without seeing a shadow. This was a lovely small alley that was almost like a maze.

Until I tearfully bid farewell to Nanshi, I couldn't bear to move out of this small alley and move to other places with more convenient access. The impression this small alley gave me was too deep!

Two years ago today, I finally left my home of more than twenty years. What a painful farewell!

At that time, my mother had just fallen ill, and she was very ill. I don't know how much my father and elder sister persuaded her, but she was unwilling to leave that dilapidated house.

"You go! My illness may be useless! And I can't call for a vehicle. You have brought so many things, can you still take me with you? Go! Go! I heard that several iron gates in the French Concession have been closed..."

In this alley, on the first day, I saw such a panicked and chaotic situation. Carrying the old and supporting the young, carrying things by hand and shoulder, people were rushing towards the two entrances like refugees, pushing and shoving each other. Seeing the urgency of the situation, my father did not wait for my mother to argue any further, and with my elder sister's help, supported her as she left our home, this small alley.

The vehicles, crowds, boxes, and items on Minguo Road were so crowded that it was impossible to tell what was yours and what was mine. It seemed that it was drizzling that day, and the road was even more muddy and difficult to walk on. At each iron gate of the French Concession, there was a dark mass of people. My mother was knocked down and helped up several times, and she kept shouting, "You go!" But at that time, her voice could not be heard at all.

As if in a dream, I can't remember who helped our family of four squeeze into the French Concession, but I remember that it was a middle-aged man who said, "Everyone is fleeing, why distinguish between each other?"

In less than two months, my mother died! She had not left home for fifty-three years, but she died outside. Her last words were, "I will not rest in peace even in death!"

Two years! Her body has not yet been buried, and the house in Nanshi is probably a pile of rubble, right? But my father always said angrily, "I can't bury her without returning to Nanshi. We should remember her last words!"

### Increased Meal Fees - It Turns Out the Teachers are Doing Rice Business

— A Parent

A month ago, I received a bill from my second son's school for an increase in meal fees. When I saw that it was six yuan, although I was a bit strapped for cash, the fee was increased for a good reason, so I didn't think it was wrong. At that time, rice cost about forty yuan per stone, and coal briquettes cost three or four yuan per dan. Which of the soy sauce, salt, vinegar, and vinegar didn't increase in price? How could the school maintain the same meal fees as when the prices hadn't increased? I even felt that an increase of only six yuan wouldn't be enough. Really, aside from my own economic situation, anyone who has managed a household would understand the plight of the kitchen bosses at that time.

A few days ago, my eldest son's school also sent a notice of an increase in meal fees, which surprised me. I was surprised that it didn't come a month earlier. A month ago, it was when prices were soaring. Now, market prices have fallen a lot. Why didn't they increase the fees when prices were rising, but now they want to increase them when prices have fallen? And they want to increase it by thirty yuan, an increase of sixty percent of the original amount!

The boarding fee at my eldest son's school is thirty yuan, and the meal fee is fifty yuan. If they increase it by another thirty yuan now, then the boarding and meal fees will be one hundred and ten yuan per semester. I ask, which school has such high boarding and meal fees? According to my eldest son, the side dishes in the school are terribly bad. A bowl of bean sprouts can be used four times. The first time, it's stewed plainly. The second time, it's topped with a few pieces of pork skin. The third time, it's stir-fried with vermicelli. The fourth time, it can still be eaten with porridge in the morning. Of course, I wouldn't completely believe my eldest son's words. He might be exaggerating, but at least you can see a glimpse of how bad the side dishes are. However, my eldest son's school has a student meal committee. When this fee increase came up, the committee negotiated with the kitchen. The result of the negotiation was that the fee increase was not the right of the kitchen. Because this time, the kitchen didn't ask the school to increase the fees at all. Before the prices increased, the school gave the kitchen one and a half yuan per table per day. After the prices increased, it was increased to two yuan and four jiao per table. But the fifty yuan meal fee that the students paid was enough to give the kitchen two yuan and five jiao per table, which is one jiao per table more than what the school gave the kitchen after the price increase. If they increase it by another thirty yuan now, wouldn't this huge fee completely fall into the pockets of the school authorities? Now, let's not worry about how the outside prices are. Just ask the school to explain the reason for the increase in fees. If it's because of rising prices, then please don't bother, because the kitchen boss, whose interests are involved, didn't ask the school authorities to increase the fees. If it's for other reasons, then please also state the reasons so that everyone can understand.

The reason has come! My eldest son said that the teachers in the school are all "doing" rice business on the side. They bought a large amount of rice when it was thirty or forty yuan. Unexpectedly, now that it has fallen, they will lose a lot of money. Therefore, they are selling it to the kitchen at the original price plus interest. But the kitchen can still maintain itself, so the reason for this fee increase is not because prices are rising, and it's not because the kitchen can't maintain itself, but it's really in the hands of the school that receives the money. They will borrow a small storm to swallow a large sum of money. However, I heard that the student council of the school has already risen up in resistance. Of course, we don't want any unfortunate events to happen in the education community during this period of national crisis, but as a parent, I don't want to send money to the school for no reason.
