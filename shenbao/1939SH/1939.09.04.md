London: An official communique was recently released stating, "Prime Minister Chamberlain instructed Ambassador Henderson to Germany on the 1st of this month to inform the German government that unless it provides guarantees to cease its aggressive actions and orders its troops to withdraw from Poland, the British government will, without hesitation, fulfill its obligations to Poland. It further notified the German government at 9:00 AM this morning that unless satisfactory guarantees are delivered to London before 11:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, a state of war will exist between Britain and Germany from that time (6:00 PM Shanghai time). The British government is currently awaiting a reply from Germany. Prime Minister Chamberlain is also scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech at 11:15 AM." (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

Paris: The deadline set by the French Ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, for the ultimatum to the German government expired at 5:00 PM. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

London: British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced today that France has joined Britain in the war against Germany. The British and French ambassadors have left Berlin. This morning, the French Ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, also delivered a note to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop with wording similar to the British ultimatum. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

London: British Prime Minister Chamberlain, at 11:15 AM this morning, told the British people via radio, "I am speaking to you from the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street. This morning, the British Ambassador in Berlin delivered a final ultimatum to the German government, stating that unless we hear by 11:00 AM that Germany is prepared to immediately withdraw its troops from Poland, a state of war will exist between Britain and Germany. I must now inform you that the British government has not received any news of Germany making such a commitment, so Britain is now at war with Germany. You can imagine how hard I have struggled to strive for peace, and how long it has taken, only to end in failure. This is a devastating blow to me, but I cannot believe that there is any other way, or any other method that I could have used, that would have been more effective at this final moment. A peaceful and honorable solution could have been negotiated between Germany and Poland, but Hitler did not want to do so. Hitler has clearly decided to attack Poland, no matter what. Although he now claims to have made reasonable proposals that were rejected by Poland, this is not true. These proposals were never shown to Poland, nor were they shown to us. Although they were announced on German radio on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear any comments on them before ordering his troops to cross the Polish border the next morning. His actions clearly indicate that he has no intention of abandoning his desire to use force, and that he can only be stopped by force. Britain and France are now fulfilling our obligations and will go to the aid of Poland, which is now bravely resisting the heinous attack on its people. We have a clear conscience, as we have done everything that any nation could have done to lay the foundation for peace. However, none of the words spoken by the rulers of Germany can be trusted. All nations and countries now feel that nothing is safe. This situation has become intolerable. We have now decided to put an end to it. I know that you will all fulfill your responsibilities with calm courage. At this moment, the pledges of support we have received from all parts of the Empire are a source of deep encouragement to us. After I finish speaking, I will make some detailed announcements on behalf of the government, to which you need to pay close attention. The government has now drawn up plans that will enable the country to carry out its major policies in the difficult days ahead. These plans require your assistance. You may enlist in the armed forces, or join the volunteer force in various parts of civil defense. If so, you must report for duty according to the instructions you receive. You may be assigned to work necessary for the conduct of the war, or to maintain the lives of the people, or to serve in factories, transportation teams, public utilities, and the supply of necessities. If so, it is essential that you each fulfill your duties. God bless you, and God defend justice, for we are fighting to eradicate all evils, such as barbaric violence, treachery, injustice, oppression, and persecution. I am determined to eradicate these evils, so that justice can prevail." (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

London: After Prime Minister Chamberlain announced the outbreak of war between Britain and Germany on the radio, air raid sirens immediately sounded in London. Residents throughout the city quickly evacuated from their homes to underground shelters, maintaining good order. When Parliament convened at noon, the all-clear sirens sounded loudly. The Prime Minister happened to be rising to speak at this time, so his first few sentences were drowned out by the sound of the sirens, making them difficult to hear.

Amid loud cheers, the Prime Minister declared, "When I spoke in the House of Commons last night, I felt that some members were still hesitating or wondering about the government's actions, harboring doubts or anxieties. If I were in the same position as the members, with no knowledge of all the information, I might have felt the same way. You must know that we spent all day yesterday in discussions with the French government. We believe that the increasingly intense actions of Germany against Poland cannot allow us to delay further in clearly stating our own position. Therefore, we decided to instruct the Ambassador to Germany to deliver the following document to the German Foreign Ministry, the content of which is as follows: 'In the document delivered on September 1st, I was instructed by my country's Foreign Minister to notify your ministry that unless the German government provides a satisfactory guarantee that it is prepared to cease all aggressive actions against Poland and is prepared to quickly withdraw its troops from Polish territory, the government of my country will, without hesitation, fulfill its obligations to Poland.'"

"As the specified time passed, no reply was received from the German side agreeing to make such a commitment, so Britain is now at war with Germany. I now inform the House of Commons that the French Ambassador in Berlin, in accordance with the agreement between the British and French governments, has presented the same note to Germany at this time, also with a firm deadline. The House of Commons is now aware of our plans. I have said that we have made all preparations. This is a day of sorrow for all of us, but no one is more sorrowful than I am. In my public life, I have painstakingly managed everything. Now everything I have managed, everything I have hoped for, and everything I have believed in has been washed away. And the only thing left for me is to use all my power to seek victory. I cannot tell you what task I will be able to fulfill, but I am confident that I will live to see the destruction of Hitlerism." (Loud cheers from the crowd.) "Live to see the re-establishment of a restored and liberated Europe." (Cheers from the crowd.)

When Green, the acting leader of the Labour opposition, rose to speak after the Prime Minister, the crowd responded with applause. Green spoke of the changed atmosphere in the House of Commons, saying that yesterday evening the House was filled with a mixture of anger, fear, and fury, fearing that further delay would result in the loss of the nation's honor and the sacrifice of the Polish people to German tyranny. This morning, the atmosphere is completely different, one of relief, composure, and determination. (Cheers) "The pain of intolerable suspense is over. We now know how to face the worst future. Britain has spoken the dreaded word 'war' to fulfill its promise to defend the freedom of Europe and its unbreakable will. What we heard was not just the word 'war,' we heard the House of Commons begin the war within. We commend the great self-restraint shown by the Polish people in recent weeks. We welcome Poland as an allied nation and will never abandon it." (Loud cheers from the crowd.) Green continued to speak with fervent emotion, emphasizing his words, "We say to Poland, 'Our hearts are with you, and with our hearts, with all our power, we will continue until peace is restored.'" Nazism will ultimately be overthrown. Green reiterated the Labour Party's support for the government's emergency plans, saying, "We will, in other respects, make a full contribution to the nation's cause, according to our opportunities. May the war be swift and assured of victory."

Liberal Party leader Sinclair said, "At this critical time, having heard the Prime Minister's moving speech, we wish to pay our full respects to the Prime Minister at this moment and express our sympathy." (Cheers) "However, we also share the same determination and steadfastness." Sinclair agreed with the Labour Party's praise of Poland. Sinclair concluded by saying, "The world should know that the British people are determined to end this Nazi frost power, and to establish an order based on justice and freedom, without looking back."

The new First Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill, said, "At this hour, it is a comfort to recall and note the repeated efforts we have made to maintain peace. These efforts have been despised, but they have all been faithful and sincere. This is of the highest moral value, not only morally, but also of practical value at present. For hundreds of millions of men and women are now united in one heart and one mind. Their cooperation is essential, and their love and affection for each other is essential. This is the only foundation on which the trials and tribulations of modern warfare can be endured and overcome. The storms of war may blow outwards, and the land may be swept by the winds, but on this Sunday morning, we truly have peace in our hearts. We must not underestimate the magnitude of the task ahead, or the severity of the trials. We must not show any signs of being unable to endure it. We must be prepared to experience all kinds of disappointments and all kinds of unpleasant surprises. But we can perhaps decide that the task we now freely accept is not beyond the power of the British Empire and the French Republic. This is not a war about Danzig and Poland. Our war is to save the whole world from the suffering of Nazi tyranny and to defend everything that is most sacred to human dignity. This is not a war for hegemony, for the expansion of the empire, or for material gain. This is not a war to prevent any country from achieving its sunlight and progress. Or to say that a war fought in the name of freedom and justice must temporarily sacrifice many of its valuable freedoms and justices; this is a necessary part of its conduct; this saying is almost true. We dare to say that this freedom will surely be held by those who do not usurp it, cultivate it, and defend it. We foresee that our freedom and justice will eventually be restored, and at that time we will share it with the nations that have not known this happiness."

Lloyd George, who decided to appoint the Prime Minister during the war, said, "The government has now responded to the recent acts of banditry. However, I fear that this is not the final decision on the various acts of banditry committed by a very strong military nation. If this military nation is not confronted, it will overturn the entire foundation of civilization. I am one of the millions who support any government in power to carry out this struggle." George described his past experiences, saying that in the worst of times, he always felt that the people of all levels were most united, and all opinions were completely eliminated. George concluded by saying, "We went through four and a half years of brutal times to achieve our goals, but since we have already won victory for justice, we will win another battle." (Cheers from the crowd.)

After a brief debate, the House of Commons opened a stock meeting to discuss emergency plans. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Germany Rejects British Ultimatum, Strong Wording Contains Five Key Points

Berlin: The official German news agency recently announced that the British Ambassador to Germany presented a note to the German Foreign Ministry at 9:00 AM this morning, demanding that Germany withdraw its troops that have entered Poland to their starting points. If the German side does not provide a satisfactory reply before 11:00 AM this morning, Britain considers itself to be in a state of war with Germany. Upon receiving notification of this ultimatum, the German government immediately sent the following memorandum to the British Ambassador, the original text of which is as follows:

The German government, having received the British government's ultimatum on September 3, 1939, can only offer the following reply: (1) The German government and people refuse to accept the British government's ultimatum-style demands. (2) For months, our eastern border has in fact been in a state of war. Since Germany tore up the Treaty of Versailles, the National Socialist German government has repeatedly attempted to eliminate the worst discrimination of that treaty through peaceful negotiations. The strong attitude of Britain is responsible for the failure to achieve amendments. If Britain had not intervened, the German government believes that the German-Polish problem could have been resolved rationally, so that both sides would consider it fair, because Germany has never had the intention of destroying Poland. However, it is the fault of the British Cabinet's policy that Germany could not achieve a negotiated solution.

(3) Britain gave Poland a blank check, promising to help it fight Germany under all circumstances. As a result, Polish terrorist activities against the Germanic people have increased unabated, and the Free City of Danzig has also been subjected to treatment that violates all legal agreements. The German government feels extremely sad, but has been forcibly restrained for five months, and has not taken aggressive actions like Poland, but only warned Poland that the German side considers this situation intolerable. If there is no other way to relieve the Germanic people, then Germany will take action. The British government has neither put pressure on Warsaw to respect existing treaties, nor accepted Mussolini's suggestion to seek the realization of European peace. Therefore, the responsibility for the misery and misfortune suffered by some people should be borne by Britain.

(4) The Polish government, due to Britain's sponsorship and promises, has adopted a tough attitude and persecuted the Germanic minority extensively, first threatening the Germanic people outside the German border, and then extensively threatening the Germanic people within the territory. Germany finally retaliated against Poland in the same way that the Polish people treated it, because the Germanic people can never allow the Polish people to abuse them.

(5) The German government therefore rejects any ultimatum-style demands and opposes the attempt to force the withdrawal of German troops. Over the years, Britain has repeatedly threatened Germany, and now it has openly made a threat of war. On the other hand, Germany has repeatedly stated its willingness to seek understanding with Britain. Then, all responsibility should be borne by the British government. The German government and people have no intention of destroying the world, but are determined to maintain their own freedom, independence, and allow their lives. Now that the British government has openly expressed its intention to destroy the German people, then Germany will also respond to every belligerent action with the same weapons and in the same form."

### Germany Boasts of Preparing for a Ten-Year War, Hitler Personally Goes to the Front Lines to Supervise the Battle

Berlin: National Socialist Party sources today announced in a happy tone that the German army has achieved its military objectives in the invasion of Poland. They also said that if Britain aids Poland, the German army is willing to fight a ten-year war with the British army. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)

Berlin: The Führer Hitler recently issued a message to the people, stating that he has decided to leave the capital today and depart for the front lines. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

Berlin: The Führer Hitler recently issued a message to the people of the entire nation at noon today, stating, "The only purpose of the policy pursued by Britain for hundreds of years has been to deprive European nations of their self-defense capabilities and implement its so-called balance of power principle, so that when Britain believes that a certain European country poses a danger to it, it can use its superiority to defeat it. Therefore, there is a history of several wars between Britain and Spain, Britain and the Netherlands, Britain and France, and Britain and Germany. At the beginning of the World War, the encirclement policy implemented by Britain against Germany was all experienced by us. Now, Britain is repeating its old tricks against Germany. Ever since Germany was governed by the National Socialist Party, it has tried to restore the heavy damage after the war and revive the country. Now, Britain is repeating its old tricks to obstruct the survival opportunities of the Germanic people and wants to use the Treaty of Versailles to sanction Germany. If we tolerate this kind of treatment again, it is tantamount to announcing the death penalty for two million Germanic people." (Haitong dispatch, 3rd)

### Important Statement by Berlin Authorities, Not Wanting to Attack Britain and France First

Berlin: German authorities recently informed foreign newspaper correspondents stationed in Berlin today, informing them that "Germany will never attack Britain and France, but if Britain and France take such action against Germany, then Germany will respond with the same action." (Haitong dispatch, 3rd)

### Air Raid Alert in London

New York: Today, a radio broadcast was received here, claiming that shortly after Chamberlain made the startling announcement this morning that Britain was at war with Germany, the first wartime air raid alert was issued in London because a squadron of aircraft of unknown nationality was seen off the southern coast of Britain. The planes then turned and flew away from the British coast, and the alert was lifted shortly after. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

London: It is heard that the issuance of London's first air raid alert was due to the discovery of an aircraft whose nationality could not be determined. However, after investigation, it was learned that it was not an enemy aircraft. The statement issued by the Ministry of Aviation is as follows: "At 11:00 AM, an aircraft was discovered flying near the south coast. Because its nationality could not be determined at the time, an alert was issued. After investigation, it was learned that it was a friendly aircraft, so the alert was lifted immediately." (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

London: After Prime Minister Chamberlain announced to the nation on the radio that Britain was at war with Germany, sirens sounded loudly, notifying the public who heard the sirens to immediately take refuge from enemy aircraft attacks. The streets and offices were quickly evacuated, but there was no panic. A Reuters reporter took a taxi from Charing Cross, passed through the Strand, and arrived at the Fleet Street office. There was no unusual feeling along the way. The taxi driver did not seem to care about the alert. A large number of Reuters staff on duty were directed by the company's air defense personnel to take refuge in a large underground shelter. The London Underground showed no signs of any abnormalities. Only the lights in the trains were dimmed once, but the trains continued to run as usual. The all-clear siren sounded at noon, when the House of Commons was in session, listening to Prime Minister Chamberlain's broadcast address. When the great clock in London struck eleven, the silent public showed expectant expressions. After the news of Britain's entry into the war was announced, the silent waiting public cheered loudly and expressed relief that Britain had finally joined the war. Then, the public flocked from the front of the British government to Downing Street. The police tried their best to maintain order, and as a result, only a small space was left in front of the door of the No. 10 residence. The sidewalks outside the Parliament were also crowded with people. When Britain announced its entry into the war, the King and Queen were spending their morning life in a secret room in Buckingham Palace. At 11:15 AM, the King and others listened to the Prime Minister's broadcast speech. There were only a few people outside the palace, surrounding one or two cars, quietly listening to the radio inside the cars. When the Prime Minister went to Parliament from 10 Downing Street, his driver placed the Prime Minister's gas mask and steel helmet in the car. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

### Poland Forced to Fight, Willing to Shed the Last Drop of Blood, The Whole Country Vows to Serve the Country

Warsaw: The Polish Prime Minister declared yesterday at a joint meeting of the Parliament, "The invincible Polish army will surely defeat our mortal enemy and advance to destroy the arrogance of the Teutonic nation." This joint meeting was secretly convened for fear of being bombed by German planes. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck sat quietly in the front row seat yesterday, appearing tired, listening to the Prime Minister's speech. The Prime Minister said, "We have now been forced to fight, and the events of the past few days will soon be announced to the world." Members of all parties are willing to shed their "last drop of blood" to defend Poland, and members of the Ukrainian and Jewish parties also have this expression. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)

Editorial

### Britain Declares War on Germany

British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced to the British people yesterday, September 3rd, at 11:15 AM: "Britain is now at war with Germany!" As of 3:00 AM this morning, news of France's declaration of war had not yet reached Shanghai, but by the time this newspaper reaches its readers, it will certainly have declared war.

As of today, we consider Germany, Poland, Britain, and France to be the belligerent nations. We pray that the scope of the war does not expand further, but it must be recognized that: Germany's invasion of Poland is the fuse; during the fuse's burning, there was still a glimmer of hope of averting the disaster, but now it has exploded, this is the first point; the belligerent nations will inevitably engage in Machiavellian schemes to win over allies, this is the second point; the progression of the war in time and space has the highest possibility of naturally expanding its scope, this is the third point; therefore, there is no way to foresee where this war will end. Even though it contradicts our prayers, the transformation of the world into a fiery furnace is not unexpected. Even considering only the four nations at war, due to the causes and nature of this war, the breadth of Britain and France's political and economic relationships with the world, and the complexity of both sides' beliefs and emotions with the world, the impact of this war during and after its duration will inevitably extend far and wide throughout the world and into future generations. We, who live in this era, must concentrate our minds and observe the changes in the world, we must deeply contemplate and clearly discern to understand the changes in the world, and we must calmly and resolutely do our utmost to adapt to the changes in the world; this is what this reporter earnestly wishes to share with and encourage readers as this great change is just beginning.

To investigate the origins of this war, tracing back through history, there are countless causes. Even with Poland, the location of this war's spark, the continuation, extinction, survival, or demise of its nation cannot be judged solely by the First World War up to this war as its beginning and end, as its origins lie far back. Even if we cut it off from the First World War, only a little over twenty years have passed, which is a very short time, but even within these twenty-odd years, researching the origins of this war is still a complex matter. If we discard the complexity and simplify it, and discuss this war solely from a political perspective, then the Treaty of Versailles should be considered the underlying cause. Supporters of the Treaty of Versailles base their arguments on the responsibility of the instigator and the obligations of the treaty; opponents of the Treaty of Versailles base their arguments on its injustice and forced signing. Supporters advocate for modification through negotiation, while opponents consider negotiation a deception and seek thorough implementation through action. The underlying cause lies there, and the disputes are like this. In recent years, the intensification of economic struggles and the failure of disarmament conferences are widely recognized by informed individuals as being sufficient to directly cause war. Furthermore, in the three years since the surfacing of disputes from the underlying causes became a reality, there have been possibilities that could trigger war at every turn. Starting from 1936, when Germany deployed troops to the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, followed by the Spanish Civil War, the annexation of Austria, the partition of Czechoslovakia, and the incorporation of Memel, if war were not a tragedy, it would have already occurred, and repeatedly at that. Why wait until today to begin the war? Today's war is primarily caused by the city of Danzig and the Polish Corridor. Or is it really the primary cause? It can also be said that it is due to the underlying cause leading to disputes and then an explosion. Some commentators often ask, "Would Britain and France fight for Poland and Danzig?" because they believe this alone is insufficient to cause a war. However, factually speaking, the primary cause lies here; and driven by facts, why must we argue about right and wrong?

After the outbreak of war, it is difficult to predict its outcome. In the current situation, apart from France, whose declaration of war has not yet arrived, but whom we consider a belligerent nation that has already declared war, other countries deserve separate attention: 1. Italy, a military ally of Germany, has recently used various ingenious methods, as described in yesterday's newspaper, to declare that it will not launch a military offensive. However, these so-called ingenious methods, even if they are not entirely eliminated by Britain and France's declarations of war, have come to an end with Britain and France's declarations of war. Their future actions are most worthy of attention. Before they have determined how to act, we should reserve all judgments and await all possible developments in fact. 2. Turkey and Romania both have mutual assistance treaties with Britain and France, and there is little doubt that they will support Britain and France. In addition, countries in Southeastern Europe, such as Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Greece, are most easily drawn into the vortex. Whether these countries participate in the war or not, how they fight, and when they fight are all critical to the situation of the war. 3. Other European countries, such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland, and Portugal, will soon announce their neutrality one after another. Whether they remain neutral to the end depends not on their national policies, but largely on what they encounter. 4. Spain, after its civil war, is pro-Italian and close to Germany. Rebuilding the nation is its top priority, and it will do everything it can to maintain its neutrality. If it fails to do so, the impact of which side it leans towards will be significant and cannot be equated with the neutrality of countries like Sweden and Norway. 5. We have always referred to Soviet policy as isolationism. Recently, public opinion in that country has been strongly advocating detachment. We certainly hope that the Soviet Union can remain detached from Europe. However, rumors of a secret agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany are frequently heard, and criticisms of Britain continue. In the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, they each have important interests. Even if they claim to be detached, they are still a European nation. 6. The United States and Japan are facing each other in the Pacific. The United States will first declare its neutrality, and Japan is now claiming to "wait and see." In short, if the European war cannot be resolved quickly, the United States and Japan will not be involved in the initial stages of the European war, which is a reasonable observation. As for China, its only task is to resist the war!

Britain is trying to use European countries and their peoples to achieve its selfish desires. Since the Soviet Union refused to cooperate with Britain, Britain has increasingly wanted to use Poland to undertake the important task of the encirclement line. The constant persecution of Germans in Poland, as well as the threats and enticements against the city of Danzig, have forced me to take countermeasures to protect the security of our German Eastern Front. Germany and the Soviet Union have now signed a mutual non-aggression pact, which means that the two major powers in Europe are now united, and the two nations will not engage in hostile actions. This can be used to reassure all the soldiers of our Eastern Front Army. In the past two days, you have all done your duty, which is an honor for the people of the country. You are now beginning to complete the greatest cause for the country, using excellent tactics to defeat our enemies.

A Japanese officer on the front line said that 20,000 Soviet troops had dug trenches east of the Khalkhin Gol River, occupied two mountain peaks, and formed a semi-circular line of around seventeen miles.

The Question of the City of Danzig: Britain Reiterates its Stance, Does Not Recognize Germany's Unilateral Abrogation of the Treaty

London: The British Foreign Secretary made a statement in the House of Lords tonight regarding the recent international situation, declaring that Britain is determined not to participate in an international conference to resolve the Danzig issue if Poland is invaded, nor will it recognize Germany's legal annexation of Danzig. The British government is currently in consultation with the French government to determine the necessary deadline for an ultimatum to Germany.

The House of Lords resumed at 6:30 PM after two temporary recesses. Foreign Secretary Halifax stated that the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at 9:30 PM last night and delivered the warning message read in the British Parliament yesterday. The German Foreign Minister replied that he must present the message to Hitler. Henderson then expressed his hope for an immediate reply, but as of yet, there has been no response. It is believed that Germany's delay in responding is due to a simultaneous proposal by the Italian government, suggesting that hostilities be halted and a five-power conference (Britain, France, Poland, Germany, and Italy) be held immediately. The British government admires the Italian government's efforts, but feels unable to participate in such a conference while Polish territory is being invaded, Polish cities are being bombed, and the Danzig issue has become a matter of military resolution. The British government will take action if Germany does not withdraw its troops from Polish territory, as has already been stated yesterday. The British government has consulted with the French government to set a deadline so that the British and French governments can determine whether the German government is actually preparing to withdraw its troops. If Germany agrees to withdraw its troops, the British government is willing to view the situation as it was before the German troops crossed the Polish border. In other words, the door is open for both Germany and Poland to discuss their disputes based on any solution that guarantees Poland's vital interests and is supported by international guarantees. If the German and Polish governments want other countries to participate in the discussion, Britain is willing to join. The Foreign Secretary also stated that one matter must be clarified to avoid confusion regarding the current situation. Forster, the leader of the National Socialist Party in Danzig, violated the Danzig constitution on August 23rd by declaring himself the head of Danzig. Yesterday, he issued an order declaring Danzig's annexation to Germany, abolishing the constitution, and requesting Hitler to implement the annexation of Danzig to Germany under German law. The German Parliament also passed a bill yesterday on the re-incorporation of Danzig into German territory. The international status of Danzig as a free city was established by treaty, and the British government is one of the signatories to this treaty. The free city of Danzig is also under the protection of the League of Nations. The rights granted to Poland by this treaty are explained and recognized by an agreement between Poland and Danzig. Yesterday's actions by the Danzig authorities and the German Parliament are a final step in unilaterally abrogating this international treaty. International treaties can only be amended through negotiation, so the British government will not recognize the actions of the Danzig authorities and the German government as valid.

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain made a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, identical to the one made by the Foreign Secretary in the House of Lords a quarter of an hour earlier. After the Prime Minister's speech, members of the House of Commons immediately began to question him. Labor leader Greenwood stated that the House of Commons was greatly disturbed by the speech and that he hoped the Prime Minister could clearly explain tonight whether it was peace or war. The entire House now has the feeling that the current state of constant unease must end sooner or later, and the sooner it ends, the better. If we are to act, I hope that the steps are consistent and that we proceed with France. What worries me is that the act of aggression occurred 48 hours ago. When this act occurred, it was the day the most recent and most important treaty was put into effect. If we show any weakness, the German dictator will see us as a failure. Is there any reason why we should not act immediately? Sinclair, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, stated that Parliament cannot tolerate the delay in fulfilling Britain's obligations to honor. Although Italy has proposed convening a five-power conference, Germany has not delayed the advance of its troops as a result of this consideration. If Germany does not quickly stop its advance, we must demand a response. This is the sentiment of Parliament. The Prime Minister replied that the government is in a difficult position and that allied countries must consult with each other by telephone to coordinate their actions. Of course, there are difficulties in this. If Parliament believes that what I have said indicates that Britain and France have adopted a somewhat weak attitude, I will be shocked. Britain has consulted with France on the shortest possible deadline for the two countries to begin action. The French government's response has not yet been received, so I cannot report it to you, but I am sure that a concrete statement can be made to the House of Commons on Sunday. Even at this last hour, I have not neglected any opportunity to avoid a major disaster. I hope to have a resolution soon so that we know where we stand. I also hope that the House of Commons will believe my words and not prolong the discussion, which would make our situation even more difficult. The House of Commons then adjourned until Sunday. It is expected that the Prime Minister will make a concrete announcement in the House of Commons today to dispel the ambiguous atmosphere of whether it will be peace or war. (Third Reuters dispatch)

Molotov's Diplomatic Report: The Process of the German-Soviet Pact

(Continued from yesterday) Furthermore, they have forgotten the main principle of our foreign policy, as stipulated by Stalin at the 18th Party Congress: "We advocate peace and strengthen business relations with all countries. This is our position, and we will adhere to it as long as these countries maintain the same relationship with us and do not attempt to infringe on our national interests." The meaning of this statement is very clear: the Soviet Union is willing to maintain good neighborly relations with all non-Soviet countries, provided that these countries treat the Soviet Union with the same attitude. Our foreign policy towards non-Soviet countries has always been in accordance with Lenin's famous principle of peaceful coexistence between Soviet and capitalist countries. There are countless examples to prove how we have implemented this principle in practice. For example, we have had a non-aggression and neutrality treaty with Italy since 1933, and no one has ever objected to it. This is not surprising, because the treaty is indeed in line with the interests of the Soviet Union and the principle of peaceful coexistence between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries. At the same time, we have also concluded non-aggression pacts with Poland and other countries of the semi-fascist type, and these pacts have not aroused any suspicion. On the other hand, China has not concluded such a treaty with certain non-fascist bourgeois democracies, such as Britain, but this is not our fault.

Educational News: Overview of Special Education in Seven Provinces; Zhongshan People's School as the Work Center, Guiding the Masses to Form Various Organizations

(Chongqing Communication) Special education was first established in the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters. In March of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), it was taken over by the Ministry of Education. The current state of this education is described below:

Organizational Situation

Initially, a special education committee was formed by five provinces: Jiangxi, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, and Shandong, with the directors of the education departments of the five provinces serving as members and one executive secretary (Mr. Li Huanzhi) stationed to handle affairs. Each provincial education department also set up a special education section to train special education teachers first, and then establish Zhongshan People's Schools and special education mobile teaching groups in each province according to plan, providing the masses with training that combines management, education, maintenance, and health. Subsequently, special education was promoted simultaneously in Hunan and Shaanxi provinces, so a total of seven provinces were involved in special education.

Overview of Expenses

When it was established in the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), in addition to the funds allocated by the headquarters, it also received subsidies from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund and the Sino-French Education Fund. Local provinces also raised one-tenth of the expenses annually. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund was originally scheduled to allocate 400,000 yuan annually, but in August of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund sharply reduced the amount by half due to a sharp drop in income. Fortunately, the Executive Yuan allocated 100,000 yuan from the national treasury for half a year in the 27th year of the Republic of China, and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund also disbursed the funds as planned. This year's expenses are still 400,000 yuan, which will be allocated by the national treasury and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to promote the development of various provinces.

State of Affairs

The promotion of special education in various provinces takes the Zhongshan People's School as the center of education, running classes for adults, women, and children, with Mandarin, arithmetic, labor, self-defense, and music as the curriculum. It also serves as a local service worker, guiding local compilation of security and armor, training strong men, guiding self-defense, assisting in requisitioning labor, assisting in military service, promoting the New Life Movement, promoting rural production, and promoting medical and health organizations and cooperatives. In addition, special education itinerant teaching groups go deep into the rural areas of remote counties to conduct popular lectures, current affairs reports, costume performances, exhibitions of charts, screenings of slides, simple treatments, home visits, field visits, and rural surveys. Various mobile teaching methods related to management, education, maintenance, and health provide the people in special areas with low levels of education with training that meets their needs. This emerging business has been in operation for several years and has been quite effective. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education has followed the principles of "adapting to the times and adapting to local conditions" to ensure that the original central goals of special education are grasped, with special emphasis on the implementation of national defense education. All Zhongshan People's Schools, in addition to continuing to operate, also stipulate that all schools close to war zones should pay special attention to assisting local self-defense training, while those in rear counties should focus on the implementation of production education. Those who unfortunately fall into enemy hands should change their methods and continue to work in place. Special education itinerant teaching groups are particularly suitable for wartime needs, so they are expanded and given priority in itinerant teaching near war zones or military strongholds and transportation hubs, paying attention to the training and organization of people's self-defense to prevent the pioneers of foreign aggression. Currently, the provinces that have established Zhongshan People's Schools include Jiangxi, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Fujian, Hunan, and Shaanxi, totaling 169 counties (counties where special education has been implemented) and 631 schools. A total of 1,778 classes have been run for children, women, and adults, with 71,391 students enrolled and 55,150 graduates. There are more than 1,500 people working in special education. The number of people educated outside the school, such as popular lectures, costume propaganda, book exhibitions, and other social education promotion activities, is no less than several hundred thousand. All provinces have established and started working with special education itinerant teaching groups, with a total of six groups except for Hunan Province. Since the War of Resistance, special education workers in various provinces have worked even harder. Previously, when Yuhang, Jiangbei, and other places were either occupied or close to war zones, special education workers remained in place to lead or participate in political training work. Even near the front lines, they assisted the army in carrying out battlefield services and accommodating a large number of child refugees, among which the performance of the workers in Yuhang was the most remarkable. This year, due to the special situation in northern Shaanxi, special education has been expanded, and the workers in the occupied areas should also be provided with relief. Approval has been obtained from the Executive Yuan to increase the allocation of 200,000 yuan to meet the needs, and various work outlines have been formulated to actively promote the work.

The Military Affairs Commission Telegraphed to Summon Military Training Instructors for Training; Military Instructors from Various Schools in Guangdong Have Set Off for Chongqing

(Shaoguan News) Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission believes that the military training of students in various provinces across the country has been going on for some time. During this period of resistance, national military training is of utmost importance. The military training of middle school students in various provinces is the most important part of military training. Therefore, during the summer vacation of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939) in various schools across the country, military training instructors from middle and upper schools in various provinces were summoned to Chongqing for training in order to improve the military training in various schools in the future. The Guangdong Provincial Government, upon receiving the relevant instructions from the Military Affairs Commission, forwarded them to the Provincial Department of Education and the National Military Training Office of the Guangdong Military District Headquarters to instruct the military training instructors of middle and upper schools in all counties and cities in the province to gather in Shaoguan and go to Chongqing for training. It is reported that the instructors have already set off for Chongqing to report for training.

Sports News: Ball Skills are Nothing More Than This; Canadian Basketball Team Defeated, Shanghai All-Star Team Wins by Four Points, Result: 41 to 37

On the night of the outbreak of the Second European War, the American-Canadian basketball team came to Shanghai to perform and met with the Shanghai All-Star team at the Chinese YMCA. The referee was Zhou Jiaqi, the inspector was Qu Honglu, and although the tickets were sold for a high price of 2.2 yuan, there were also 440 spectators, many of whom were female, so there were many strange screams. As a result, the guest team lost to the home team by a score of 37 to 41, a difference of four points. In the first half, the Shanghai team took the lead with a score of 21 to 15.

Review

The strength of the Canadian team is not as good as the University of Washington team that came to Shanghai last time. Its strengths are (1) tall and strong, (2) fast at blocking attacks, and its weaknesses are inaccurate shooting (only No. 11, Willoughby, has a good long shot), and the same is true for free throws, otherwise it can be avoided. The fatigue of traveling also has something to do with it. The All-Star team is equivalent to the Paramount of that year. Li Zhenzhong's last-minute escape is disappointing. Ren Xiangcheng, Bao Songyuan, and Lu Gu were unable to play, and the previous wave did not give the next wave a chance to advance, which made everyone regret it. In yesterday's game, Zhou Dayun performed the best, his shooting was superb, and he swept away the miscellaneous air of the Battle of Liangxi (his mistake was failing to guard No. 11). The second was Cai Yanxiong, who was flexible in dribbling (sometimes a bit too much), and one person took charge of the defense. The merit of the two Chens lies in their skillful passing and blocking. Xu, Sun, and Lu were just average. Because the Canadian team attacked more, the Shanghai team also committed a lot of fouls, but the Canadian team missed the shot 50 times (the Shanghai team only missed 34 times), and the free throws missed 11 times (the Shanghai team only missed 5 times). What is gained and what is lost is obvious. The starting lineups of both sides are as follows:

Battle Situation

Dayun took the lead and scored two consecutive points. Zhou and Cai committed fouls, and Pai and Luo made free throws one after another. Then Cai shot the ball himself and scored another goal, making the score 6 to 2. Unexpectedly, the Canadian team worked hard, and Wei and Luo scored three consecutive points. The Shanghai team called a timeout for the first time, and Dayun made the score 8 to 8. The Canadian team called a timeout for the first time, and Beden replaced Wei. Hui Pei took the lead with a free throw, but because he committed three fouls, he was replaced by Lu Zhongen. Xianglong was also replaced by Wen Kui. Yanxiong committed a foul and lost two points. Zhou and Chen quickly scored, and Ross made a throw, making the score 13 to 12. The Shanghai team called a timeout for the second time, Lu committed a foul, and Gordon scored. Wen Kui had good luck, attacking from afar and close, and lived up to his mission. At the end of the first half, the Shanghai team took the lead with a score of 21 to 15, leading by six points. After the break, there was no change in the lineups of both sides. Dayun made a shot, Parsons made a free throw, and Ross made another throw, making the score 23 to 18. The Shanghai team called a timeout for the third time, Xianglong replaced Wen Kui, Zhou Dayun scored two points, and Wei Luobei scored three consecutive points, making the score 27 to 24, only leading by three points. The Shanghai team called a timeout for the fourth time, as a technical foul, and lost another point. Xue Chong and Yanxiong worked hard, and regained the advantage with a score of 31 to 25. The Canadian team called a timeout for the second time, Ross made a throw, Dayun doubled the return, Wei Luobei made a throw, Zhou Dayun took it back again, Ross added fuel and made a contribution under the basket, and Gordon replaced Parsons. Xue Chong, Wei Luobei, and Ross each achieved something.

39 to 35. Shanghai called a timeout for the fifth time, and the Canadian team lost a free throw opportunity. There was only one minute left, so the Shanghai team took a chance, replacing Cai with Mao and Long with Xu. Xu and Wei each scored a goal, and the time ended. The Shanghai team defeated the Canadian team with a score of 41 to 37. The Canadian team's ball skills were nothing more than this, and the audience was disappointed.

Economic Weekly: European War and Japan by Zhang Yifan

How Will the United States and the Soviet Union Deal with Japan?

If the German-Polish war cannot be "resolved quickly" as Hitler hoped, then Britain and France will not be able to sit idly by, and the United States and the Soviet Union will eventually have to participate. Britain and France will naturally be hostile to Germany and Italy, and the United States and the Soviet Union will make resolving the Far East issue a prerequisite for participating in the European war. Britain and France may participate in the war starting with Italy's mobilization, or with a change in the British cabinet, or with the need to maintain international prestige, or with the discovery that Poland's military strength is not sufficient for Britain and France to provide assistance. Although it is difficult to determine at present, the fact is that Britain, France, and Poland are in the same position: that is, if they do not participate in the war and sit idly by while Hitler smashes the Polish army, they themselves are in danger of being suddenly attacked by the German-Italian coalition. If they take preemptive action, they can not only enhance the Polish army's resilience in combat, but also have the hope of breaking the German-Italian paper tiger and eliminating hidden dangers.

Although the Soviet Union has restored diplomatic relations with Germany, it has no need to get involved in the vortex due to its geographical environment. Recently, Berlin has spread the rumor that Germany and the Soviet Union have an atmosphere of further establishing a military alliance, but in fact it is just an atmosphere. The Soviet Union's worldview recognizes this as a mutual slaughter between imperialists. If it gets involved in the vortex, it is asking for its own demise. Hitler also understands this in his heart, and the reason why he is willing to make a deal with the Soviet Union is only to hope that the Soviet Union will not join the British and French camp, which is enough for him. Hitler believes that if Poland can be resolved quickly, Britain and France may wait and see. Therefore, Germany's attack on Poland may be moderate, which not only creates conditions for Britain and France to wait and see and miss the opportunity, but also reduces the Soviet Union's suspicion and keeps the Soviet Union in check. So, to what extent will the scale of the German-Polish war develop? It is difficult to measure for a while, but the hope of not expanding has now only accounted for one percent.

Since the Soviet Union's position on the European war is such, it is completely opposite to the Far East. Because he wants to stabilize the safety of Siberia, only when a war occurs in Europe is it a golden opportunity. Since the conditions are ripe, of course he will not miss it lightly. However, his actions must wait until Britain and France participate in the war and a real all-European war begins before they can truly unfold. As for the United States, its situation is generally the same as that of the Soviet Union. The reason why isolationists can develop some influence in the United States is only to take advantage of the American people's unwillingness to interfere in European affairs and the possibility of not interfering in European affairs. The situation in the Far East is very different. Because of Japan's arrogance and the activities of Japanese immigrants along the Pacific coast and Panama coast of the United States, they have deeply felt a personal danger. Moreover, Japan's success in invading China will not only fundamentally eliminate all the rights and interests and positions that he has established in the Far East for decades, but also help Japan cross the Pacific and directly attack the Americas. As for the safety of the Philippines, it is even more unbearable to ask. For this reason, his inability to sit idly by the situation in the Far East is equal to that of the Soviet Union. The European war has reduced his burden on the Atlantic. So, this may be a good opportunity for him to eliminate hidden dangers. Moreover, he is best at taking advantage of opportunities, and participating in the European war must wait until the opposing side is exhausted. Of course, it is not possible to talk about it now at the beginning of the European war. But in the Far East, Japan has been fighting for more than two years, and if the United States takes action, it is actually easy.

The situation created by the German-Polish war in the international community is such, and the position of Japan in the German-Polish war and the European war period is also such. Therefore, what the European war gives Japan is only unlimited disadvantages. This is only the conclusion obtained from political and military observations. As for the economic aspect, the situation may be even more unexpected.

The Source of Military Supplies is Cut Off

Once the European war starts, the export trade of military supplies from various European countries will naturally stop immediately. The only countries that can continue to supply are the United States and the Soviet Union. However, the conflict of interest between the United States and the Soviet Union and Japan is so intense that they will naturally not be willing to help the enemy. It is true that ordinary military suppliers only love money, and Japan has indeed obtained a lot of military supplies from the United States in the past two years, but this is one time and another is another. At that time, it was only because there were no major customers in Europe that they did not hesitate to deal with Japan. Now that the customers in Europe are much larger than Japan, at the same time, changes in the international environment will greatly clarify the United States' diplomatic policy toward Japan. Therefore, it can be said that Japan has absolutely no hope of buying military supplies from the United States. As for the Soviet Union, the military industry belongs to the state-owned enterprise, and foreign trade also belongs to the state-owned enterprise. The conflict of interest between Japan and the Soviet Union is so sharp that they are not even willing to help the enemy in peacetime, let alone now? This is still the case before the United States and the Soviet Union have taken action against Japan. As for once it is launched, it goes without saying.

Trade and Raw Materials

In the future, Japan will not only have no import source of military supplies, but will also fall into the possibility of not being able to continue general export trade at all. Because his industrial structure is not sound at all, and the lack of raw materials is his fatal wound. Although he can expand the looting work in the Chinese theater, European countries in the war will manage import trade and severely restrict the import of non-military supplies. Japan is too busy to take care of military supplies, and the exports are only limited to the products of peaceful industries, which are exactly in the list of countries restricting imports. At that time, Japan's only way out may be to seize China's raw materials and transport them to Europe and the United States in order to exchange for foreign exchange. The purpose is of course to exchange for military supplies. As mentioned earlier, his hope has now completely disappeared. Therefore, this method only strengthens the raw material panic in his country and promotes the overall collapse of his entire economic structure. This is definitely not deliberately boosting his own courage. Now he can put forward many evidences to show that the raw material panic in his country has reached an unbearable degree. The following is a statistical table of their own survey, which shows the sharp reduction rate of raw material inventories in Japanese warehouses with serious domestic raw material panic. The reduction rate in June of this year compared to the same period last year (%) (Note) According to the survey of the Japanese Warehouse Association and the Raw Material Association, see this issue on the 81st of the month. If there is a publishing factory, it has sufficient content. In addition to page 47 of the Book of Bu, there is still a way for gold, but now he has to rely entirely on the method of forcing his people to save money and food to obtain export foreign exchange. The income is limited, so he vigorously restricts the import of non-essential goods, and even restricts the import of raw materials for peaceful industries in order to buy military supplies. This is already miserable enough, let alone his future export hope will be fundamentally lost. Japan, an industrial country with no raw materials, must prepare a large amount of foreign exchange every day to purchase raw materials. Once raw materials cannot be issued or are issued less, he has to reduce work or even close the door, which will immediately lead to social unrest, shake the people's hearts, and finally step into the crisis of total collapse. Japan's inventory has now dropped sharply, reflecting that his crisis is not far away. And this German-Polish war is accelerating the arrival of his crisis.

Major National Population Crisis

Japan has now not only fallen into the terror of the raw material panic, but also seriously fallen into the terror of the foreign exchange panic, and has also experienced a more fatal and tragic terror of the population panic. Recently, Japanese publications have been full of articles on population issues, all of which are anxious and worried. This problem first occurred in factories and rural areas. Because of the military mobilization, the labor force is greatly insufficient. He can only rely on closing the doors of factories that produce peaceful products to pull in some re-employed workers. In rural areas, the old, weak, women, and children are used to fill the cultivation after the strong men go to war. However, the panic of skilled workers cannot be resolved. Therefore, the group raises wages to compete for workers, causing chaos. Now the battlefield has infinitely increased the number of deaths, and the expansion of the front line infinitely requires the replenishment of manpower. The panic of insufficient domestic labor is becoming more and more intense. And a bigger crisis of the Japanese national population has been discovered. This is (1) most of the strong men go to war and die, the number of marriages drops sharply, so the birth rate drops sharply compared with the past. (2) The health of the people is greatly damaged due to excessive savings and excessive labor, and the natural death rate is increasing sharply. If the deaths on the battlefield are added, it is even more unbearable to see. (3) The birth rate drops sharply and the death rate increases sharply, so the natural growth rate of the population declines sharply. According to the survey results of Dr. Sadajiro Ueda, it has been found that the composition of the Japanese population has embarked on a deformed trend, that is, there are more old and young people and fewer strong people. The more old people there are, the greater the mortality rate. The fewer strong people there are, the lower the birth rate. Therefore, Dr. Ueda inferred that in the next twenty years, the development of the Japanese national population will only decrease and not increase (see his "Population Policy", page 98). Ueda is an authority on Japanese demography, and what he said is even more loved by the people of Japan. Other experts such as Kikunosuke Kori and Motoji Kamiya also expressed pessimism. Therefore, the "Women's Public Opinion Monthly" recently published in Tokyo had two Ph.D.s in Sociology, Shigehana Takeuchi and Tadashi Sato, singing the eccentric theory that "early marriage is beneficial."

Steamed Buns: For example, a small family, a couple, a son or a daughter, uses about five pounds of dry flour, adds one pound of clear water, and kneads it by hand until it becomes a hard clay-like consistency. Then add four taels of yeast powder (about one rice bowl, not too much or too little, because too much will make it sour, and too little will make it difficult to ferment thoroughly). Knead it evenly again, cover it with a damp towel, and place it in a warmer place (such as next to the stove). After two or three hours, the flour will definitely double in size. At this time, you can make the shape of steamed buns or stuffed buns (you can add sugar, meat, or vegetables as you like). After making them, steam them in a steamer over water until cooked, which is enough for one day's consumption.

Noodles: Use five pounds of flour, add one rice bowl of salt water or clear water, and knead evenly. Use a wooden stick to roll and press it continuously to make it into a thin flannel-like sheet, then repeatedly fold it up, cut it into strips, open it, and you will have long noodles. After cooking, add sesame oil, lard, soy sauce and other seasonings, and mix well to eat. If you eat it with soup, you can reduce one pound of flour and add a little green vegetables to cook together.

Pancakes: Use two pounds of flour (because it is too dry when eating, it needs to be eaten with porridge), add a little clear water, knead it, and use a stick to roll and press it into a round thin sheet equal to the size of the bottom of the pot. Brush some lard, sprinkle some chopped green onions and salt, fold it over, and then roll and press it with a stick. After doing this twice, you can put it in the pot and bake it until cooked.

Soup Dumplings: Use a basin to hold five pounds of flour, pour in one and a half pounds of boiling water, and quickly stir with a wooden stick continuously; when it cools slightly, knead it by hand, cut it into small pieces, and roll it into thin slices with a wooden stick. Wrap the filling of meat, vegetables, or mushrooms and dried shrimps inside, and make stuffed buns, dumplings, or triangular shapes. Steam them in a steamer over high heat. After cooking, the outer skin is smooth and soft, and very delicious.

### A Week's Worth of Economical Meal Plans

Ms. Hua Ying

The editor of this publication forwarded a letter from Ms. Xu Xiuying a few days ago, stating that rice prices are soaring and she would like to make馒头 (Mantou, steamed buns) to fill her stomach, and asked me how to make Mantou, requesting that I answer here. Fortunately, my family is also making Mantou to eat with rice, so I will share my family's method: The first essential element in making Mantou is fermentation. You can buy a cube of "yeast" (酵母) from a bakery for a dime and mix it with warm water in a large bowl. In another large bowl, put half a bowl of warm water, mix half a teaspoon of salt, one tablespoon of lard, and three tablespoons of sugar together, and then combine it with the yeast solution. On the one hand, put the sifted flour (three pounds) in a kneading basin, and slowly pour in those solutions, mixing it carefully. At this time, there is more water, so it is called wet dough. After half an hour, pour the wet dough onto a floured board and knead it with your hands until it is soft and does not stick to your fingers. After kneading, put it in a bowl, cover it with a clean cloth, and place it near the stove to allow the yeast to ferment thoroughly. After two hours, you can start wrapping red bean paste or meat filling inside. If you want to eat it with vegetables, then the filling can be omitted. Immediately put it in a steamer and steam it over boiling water for five or six minutes. Then you can eat it. This week's menu is listed as usual, suitable for eating with rice or Mantou.

### Methods for Making Noodles at Home

— Northerner

The high price of rice is forcing Southerners who are used to eating rice to eat noodles as well. Many families are now eating noodles. The simplest ways to make noodles from flour are noodles and steamed buns. Now, I will share the methods and ways to eat both:

Noodles: Put the flour in a basin, add water and stir. Do not add too much water, just enough to make the dough form a hard lump (otherwise the noodles will be too soft and stick together when cooked). Then, knead it vigorously on the table to make it extremely even inside. Then use a "rolling pin" to roll it into a sheet of dough, and cut it into strips to make noodles. There are several ways to eat noodles in the North:

(1) Noodles with Fried Sauce: Fry sweet bean sauce (sold in sauce shops) with a lot of oil for a while. When mixing the noodles, add some mung bean sprouts, edamame, shredded raw cucumber, and aged vinegar for an even better taste.

(2) Cold Noodles: The seasonings for cold noodles are sesame oil, white sugar, diced ginger, and soy sauce. For this method, the noodles should be thin and firm. After cooking, rinse them in cold boiled water to make them smooth and refreshing. They taste great in summer.

(3) Sesame Paste Noodles: Mix sesame paste with salt and a little cold boiled water, and add some vinegar, mung bean sprouts, etc. when mixing the noodles.

Other simple and delicious options include noodles with chives and noodles with vegetables.

Steamed Buns (馒头): Commonly called "馍" in the North, the method is to soak the dough starter (about the size of a teacup, bought from a big cake stall) in water the night before (the amount of water depends on how much you want to eat), add flour and stir, similar to making noodles, but it doesn't need to be too hard, slightly softer is fine. Cover with a cloth and by the morning the dough will have fermented and risen very high. At this time, add alkali and knead the dough (the alkali must be dissolved in boiling water and allowed to cool before adding. Based on my personal experience, the amount of alkali is one cent's worth of alkali for every four bowls of flour, but the exact amount still depends on each person's experience. Too little will cause a sour taste, too much will turn it yellow. The amount of flour added depends on the softness or hardness of the dough, it should be neither too hard nor too soft to be most suitable). Knead it a lot on the table, forming a thick strip, cut into rectangular pieces, and let it rest for a while before putting it in the steamer (must cover with a damp cloth). Steam it over very boiling water, the heat must be strong, for about 45 minutes. To check if it's done, just press it and if it springs back it's cooked, if it's not cooked it won't spring back. Making steamed buns is more troublesome and difficult than making noodles, but you will become skilled with practice. There are more varieties of steamed buns than noodles: like meat buns, bean paste buns, and pork and sugar buns, you need to know how to make steamed buns to make them. According to my taste, dishes to eat with steamed buns include: shredded beef stir-fried with onions, vegetables, chives, beef soup, mutton soup, stir-fried sauerkraut, etc., there are countless good options.

### Methods for Making Noodles and Their Benefits

— Wu Jing

Living in Shanghai these days is truly difficult, and the high price of rice is particularly alarming. As a result, ordinary citizens are using flour as a substitute for rice. However, Southerners have fewer ways to eat noodles, and eating them for a long time can feel monotonous and tasteless. If we can find ways to adjust them, this drawback can be eliminated. Therefore, I am now offering several methods for general reference:

(1) Noodles: Mix flour and water evenly, press it with your hands to make it sticky, and then roll it thin with a rolling pin. Then fold it and cut it into narrow strips. When rolling, you must apply a little bit of tapioca starch to prevent the dough from sticking to the rolling pin. After cutting into strips, put them in the sun to dry slightly to prevent them from becoming mushy when cooked.

(2) Dough Balls: Mix flour and water into a batter (thinner than for noodles). Use chopsticks to pinch pieces the size of your fingers and gradually drop them into boiling water to cook. Mix with lard and soy sauce, and add some vegetables for a special flavor.

(3) Chive Pancakes: Finely chop the chives, mix with flour and water into a batter, pour into a frying pan, spread it flat and cook until done. The number and size can be arbitrary, and you don't need a lot of oil. Cook until the chives are browned.

(4) Scallion Pancakes: Finely chop the scallions, mix with oil and salt, and then mix the flour and water evenly (about as thin as when making noodles). Then roll it out with a rolling pin to about half the thickness of noodles. Spread a thin layer of lard on top (or you can scatter raw lard on top), then densely spread the scallions on top, roll it into a strip, cut it into pieces about an inch long. Press down on the cut end of each piece, then flatten it, and put it into a frying pan to cook until done. It is quite fragrant, loose, and delicious.

(5) Vegetable Buns: Use vegetables instead of scallions for scallion pancakes. You don't need to cut them. Put them in a pot of water and steam them until cooked. Take them out, cut them, and eat them for a fresh and fragrant taste.

(6) Vegetable Wonton: Mix flour and water, roll it out, and cut it into pieces to make wonton wrappers. Then chop vegetables, onions, mushrooms, and dried shrimp finely and mix them into the filling, wrap the wontons, and put them in boiling water to cook. Then make a soup with ham, dried shrimp, and soy sauce. The deliciousness is far above that of meat filling.

(7) Vegetable Dumplings: Mix flour and water, roll it into a strip, pinch off small pieces, roll each one thin with a rolling pin, and then use the size of a rice bowl to cut out round pieces. Wrap with vegetables, onions, dried shrimp, and other fillings (also must be finely chopped). Fold the round pieces in half, crimp the edges, and put them in boiling water to cook (when making dumplings, the top half must be larger to allow for crimping, the crimping is the same as folding a skirt).

(8) Mix flour and water, add a little bit of baking powder, mix well, and put it in a warmer place to wait for it to ferment (fermented dough is lighter and has a jade color). Then make it into a 馒头 shape and steam it in a pot of water until cooked. The quality of the 馒头 depends entirely on whether the amount of ingredients used is appropriate. Do it a few more times and you will gain experience.

(9) Thick Noodle Soup: First boil the water, then mix the flour and water into a slurry (or you can add an egg), pour it into the boiling water and stir slightly.

If every housewife can change the method of making noodles every day, then she will not feel the monotony of eating noodles, and will feel the endless flavor of them. Wheat is more nutritious than rice, and it can prevent swelling and dampness in the legs. If we eat it for a long time, not only can we adjust our finances, but also improve our health. Why not do this win-win thing?

Spring and Autumn

### The Market is Flooded with Substitute Vouchers

— Xin Meng

Hoping Various Industries Will Voluntarily Limit Issuance—Hoping Stamps Can Still Be Accepted as Substitutes

A month ago, someone estimated that the value of stamps circulating in the Shanghai market amounted to 400,000 yuan; a month later, if someone were to make an accurate estimate of the value of substitute vouchers circulating in the market today, I'm afraid it would not be less than 400,000 yuan!

The temporary incident involving the issuance of fractional currency notes, which were temporarily suspended, resulted in 400,000 yuan worth of stamps stopping circulation. On the other hand, all kinds of colorful substitute vouchers have appeared on the market, and the amount of circulating vouchers is so great that it is unthinkable!

Currently, the substitute vouchers we find on the market are either issued independently by a single company or business, or jointly by several companies or businesses, or simply written with a few words on ordinary white paper, stamped with a few seals, and used as substitute vouchers, marked to be used as one or two cents.

In addition to the substitute vouchers issued by stores, the market is even more flooded with substitute vouchers from tram companies, nickel and copper tokens from buses, gift coupons from various cigarettes, marked one cent, two cents, or five cents, which are also commonly used. Even gift coupons marked for two cigarettes are used as one cent. Bamboo chips and bamboo sticks are also used for small change after being branded with a fire seal. The variety is truly endless.

With so many substitute vouchers circulating in the market, most of them can only be used in one section of the road. They cannot be used when taken far away, and counterfeit substitute vouchers are constantly being discovered. Some counterfeiters imitate others, while others have coupons but no store, which are completely fabricated. Especially with so many substitute vouchers circulating in the market, the cost of printing and paper is also quite high, which is a meaningless waste.

When you carry a few substitute vouchers with you, some of the words are printed vaguely, and some of the paper is broken. When buying things, one voucher is not accepted, then another is not accepted. It is truly annoying and unbearable. The housewives going to the vegetable market are also holding a bunch of substitute vouchers, unable to use them for one thing or another, and have to bring back a few every day to put at home as waste paper. We can often see people arguing over substitute vouchers, and even starting fights. Isn't everyone complaining that substitute vouchers are really annoying?

In short, except for tram substitute vouchers, bus tokens, and the substitute vouchers of a few large companies and stores, which can be received everywhere, most of the remaining substitute vouchers are only used in one area, or even one store, which is more annoying and troublesome than when stamps were commonly used. Therefore, we can only hope that the Central Bank can quickly issue fractional currency notes, and at the same time hope that stores that have not issued substitute vouchers will not issue them indiscriminately. As for stamps, we still hope that they can be accepted, as this would be more convenient.

### Transparent Shanghai

— Huang Ziqiang respectfully submits

Editor: Please read this short letter to the end, and if it is convenient, please grant it disclosure in a corner of Spring and Autumn. I would be very grateful. Recently, all newspapers have disclosed a news item about a "couple robbed while watching a movie." This news item may not attract the attention of readers, because in this "isolated island," everyone lacks the ability to absolutely avoid the threat of theft. Therefore, even "daytime robbery" is not considered surprising news. However, this news item caught my attention, which led to some foolish thoughts, which is the reason I hope to be disclosed.

Which movie theater did this couple go to? What movie were they watching? After asking these two questions, I think some people might laugh dumbfounded? Unless you're blind, everyone has read those provocative and enticing words! But I'm not blind either, and my thoughts start from here.

After the fall of Greater Shanghai, any entertainment business on the "isolated island" has presented a state of distorted development. Among them, there are naturally unscrupulous merchants who are unconsciously instilling toxins into the audience; however, under the limitations of the objective environment, the spirit of artists working hard and struggling is generally evident!

Recently, however, such a sad phenomenon has been discovered, appearing in one place, two places, and three places, and the future development is still unknown. This development relies on special protection. Besides asking the host to "turn back to the shore," we have no way to stop it, but passive action is everyone's responsibility. Please ask yourself first, can I watch that kind of movie? Why do I want to watch that kind of movie? If your own answer is: "No!" "No reason!" then you have fulfilled your responsibility.

Finally, there is a further extravagant hope to limit the spread of propaganda. In the middle of black and white, Shanghai is like transparent glass, everything is clear and distinct. Please support this difficult period with even greater effort, and do not imprint your shadow on the transparent glass.

Chapter Fifteen: A Sudden Overseas Scandal Welcomes Tao Ye, A Miraculous Scene in the Fire Reveals a Lotus Flower

In short, Cheng Gong's effort this time was a success. Two weeks later, Mrs. Ai invited relatives and friends to a celebratory banquet. She was definitely not like the Cui Prime Minister's wife in the Chinese play "Romance of the Western Chamber," who, after Zhang Junrui saved Miss Yingying, wanted to remove the ladder and treat him as her brother. She said, "Love is not limited by race. At the time, I was anxious at the fire scene and shouted for someone to save my daughter Alice. Many gentlemen were also present. They were all from my white race, priding themselves on chivalry and able to protect the weak. In the end, it was this Mr. Cheng who bravely risked his life to save my daughter from the fire. Let's not talk about personal feelings; let's just talk about character. How can we still look down on Chinese people?" At the same time, Mrs. Ai announced the engagement of her daughter Alice to Mr. Cheng Gong of China. At that time, everyone was speechless, and even Alice's conservative aunt dared not say anything derogatory about the Chinese. Later, Cheng Gong returned after obtaining a doctorate in France, and Alice followed her husband to China. They had a son and a daughter. This daughter is now Mr. He's second wife and the stepmother of Mr. He's two daughters. Alice is now old, about seventy years old, and she has inherited her mother's estate, which is more than enough for her. Mr. Cheng Gong is a few years older than his French wife. After returning to China, he served as a diplomat for several years before retiring and living in Singapore. His son has now started working because his son and Mr. He are very close. Mr. He often visits their home, and this young Mr. Cheng introduced his sister to Mr. He, resulting in a happy marriage. Therefore, Mr. He's two daughters often joke that their stepmother can be considered half white. Their two younger brothers are one-quarter white, one-quarter meaning one-fourth. In the past, children born to parents from Europe and Asia, or of yellow and white races, were often called "mixed-race children." This term "mixed-race" carried a derogatory connotation, implying that they were not of pure blood. Furthermore, they rigidly distinguished which race was noble and which was inferior, leading to increasingly deep-seated racial prejudices. Even within the same race and bloodline, differences in status and occupation led to distinctions between noble and base, preventing marriage between them. Racial prejudices have led to many bloody wars. Later, as the world moves towards greater unity, this narrow-minded concept must be broken down for true world peace. Therefore, by the second half of the twentieth century, intermarriage between Europeans and Asians was considered natural, and mixed-race children were everywhere. (177)
