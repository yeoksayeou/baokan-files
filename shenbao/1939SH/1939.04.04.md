British Ambassadors to China and Japan

### To Hold Conference in Shanghai; Purpose is to Deal with Japan; Japanese Newspaper Predicts Increased Pressure on Japan After the Meeting; Urges its Government to Change Strategy

(Tokyo) The Nichi Nichi Shimbun claimed that the British ambassadors to China and Japan will hold a conference in Shanghai. Their purpose is to undermine Japan's attempt to build a new order in East Asia. The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, set off from Yokohama on Sunday for Shanghai to discuss everything with the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. The newspaper urged Japan to completely and immediately change its policy towards Britain, and recounted the political and economic activities of Britain in China in the years after the British government's economic advisor, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, went to China to reform the Chinese currency system. The newspaper further pointed to Sir Miles Lampson (former British Ambassador to China), Mr. Hall-Patch (Financial Advisor to British Embassy in China) and Sir Victor Sassoon and Mr. Woodhead, as figures involved in activities in China. The newspaper also stated that, given Britain's past actions, it is expected that after Craigie and Kerr meet in Shanghai, Britain's pressure on Japan will increase, and Britain's dreams of destroying Japan's military in China will likely be prolonged. The newspaper strongly stated that now is an opportune time to re-examine Japan's policy towards Britain and make appropriate corrections, saying "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Britain's policy has been aimed at placing economic obstacles in Japan's path, hoping for the collapse of Japan's economy and finances. Unless the Sino-Japanese War ends, Britain will continue this policy." The newspaper also predicted that Britain will continue to assist General Chiang Kai-shek's government, while also trying to persuade other democratic countries to jointly intervene in Japan's policy towards China in order to maintain Britain's power and interests in China.

Editorial

### From Axis to Triangle

American journalist T. A. Bisson recently published an article entitled "From Axis to Triangle." This title can be borrowed for use, because the recent turbulent international situation is rapidly revolving around this "axis" and "triangle."

In Europe, the changes in the international situation are as fast as a dream. In the last ten days alone, Czechoslovakia is gone; Memel has been annexed; peaceful Spain has been painted in Fascist colors; Romania has been burdened with the weight of a semi-colony; and Poland is painfully feeling the danger of Nazi troops pressing on the border... From Austria to Czechoslovakia, from Czechoslovakia to Memel to Romania or Poland, this series of tragedies or disasters, this wolf-like attack on the European continent, is all caused by the German-Italian axis of aggression. Hitler and Mussolini seem to be engaged in a competition of aggression. They use "intimidation" as a tool, boast of their axis, and collude to plunder the interests of Britain, France, and other weaker countries. Mussolini just finished a set of intimidation, and Hitler came up with another set. They take turns in this way, rising and falling. Under the appeasement policy of the British and French rulers, the aggressive offensive of the Berlin-Rome axis is obviously expanding and increasingly endangering the security and interests of Britain and France.

True, there are contradictions between Germany and Italy, and with Hitler's expansion in Central and Southern Europe, these contradictions are deepening day by day. Germany and Italy have contradictions in Central Europe and in the Balkan Peninsula. Now, Austria and Czechoslovakia have indeed fallen into Hitler's grasp, and Italy's power in the Balkans has been completely swept away. Hitler's step-by-step expansion of power in Central and Southern Europe is undoubtedly a thorn in Mussolini's back.

However, this contradictory force will not break up or weaken the collusion between Germany and Italy at present; on the contrary, this deepening contradiction between Italy and Germany will inevitably expand and intensify the aggressive offensive of the German-Italian axis to the outside world. Why? There is a reason for this.

First of all, from Abyssinia to Spain, Italy's feet are sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire; while Hitler took Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Memel without spending a single soldier. In this regard, the "Brownshirt brother" is undoubtedly stronger than his "Blackshirt brother." Due to Hitler's relative strengthening, Mussolini has become increasingly a German appendage in diplomacy. Mussolini's speech at the end of last month had a telephone conversation with Hitler beforehand. From this fact alone, it can be seen that Berlin controls Rome. From Mussolini's praise of the German-Italian axis and from Italy's need to rely on Hitler, it can be determined that Mussolini currently dares not break with Germany.

Second, from Hitler's point of view, it is the same. He needs Italy to act as Germany's watchdog, using it to attack Britain and France from the Mediterranean in order to strengthen his "blackmail" momentum. Goering said: "Each step of Germany's expansion of power is also a step in the increase of Italy's power; each step in the increase of Italy's power is also a step in the expansion of Germany's power." Hitler's speech the day before yesterday specifically stated: "The relationship between the Axis countries is more solid than any agreement between other countries."

Therefore, third, although the contradictions between Germany and Italy are deepening, they still need to mutually boast of cooperation on the basis of aggression; Mussolini has suffered a loss in front of his powerful ally, and in order to avoid conflict, he can only turn to Britain and France, who are still unable to stand up straight, to seek compensation, and this is precisely the joint strategy of the anti-communist group led by Hitler. In a word, the deepening contradictions between Italy and Germany have promoted Italy to intensify its attacks on Britain and France from the Mediterranean.

Not only that. This European axis of aggression has also expanded to the Far East, forming a triangular relationship with Japanese imperialism. This aggressive "triangle" was initially formed on November 6, 1937, with the "Anti-Comintern Pact." More recently, this aggressive triangle has been further expanded and strengthened. Like Italy, Japanese imperialism, weakened by the war against China, has increasingly been reduced to Hitler's appendage in diplomacy. The Zhanggufeng Incident taught the Japanese warlords a lesson; the Soviet Union's head cannot be touched; the Munich Incident also hinted to the Japanese warlords; Britain and France are weak and can be deceived. At the same time, within Japan, due to the failure of the Kwantung Army, the Navy's southward advance theory is gradually rising; Arita, who advocated strengthening the "Anti-Comintern Pact," succeeded Yosuke Matsuoka, who had coordinated diplomacy with Britain and France. In this way, the Japanese warlords changed their strategy from attacking the north to advancing south, and in early February of this year, they first occupied Hainan Island, an important base in the Pacific Ocean. This happened to be implementing Hitler's will. Because this move not only threatened the interests and status of Britain, France, and the United States, but also allowed them to peer into the Indian Ocean from Hainan Island, connect with Germany and Italy, and create a new triangular situation for the anti-communist group.

The situation created by the Hainan Island Incident is extremely serious. However, the British and French authorities did not make any stronger representation than to lodge a few protests. This naturally encouraged the aggressors. Recently, Japanese warlords have simply intensified their collusion with Germany and Italy and further infringed upon the interests of Britain and France. We can use the facts of the past few days to prove this: First, the Spratly Islands (Sprattley Is.) belonging to France were occupied by the Japanese army again on March 31. The Spratly Islands are south of Hainan Island, only four hours by plane from Singapore, and only one hour from French Indochina and British Borneo. The threat to Britain, France, the United States, and the Netherlands is naturally very great; Second, the anti-British movement in the occupied areas is becoming more and more intense, and even the church is being discriminated against by the puppets. This is clearly an ugly drama directed by the Japanese warlords; Third, it was rumored in Berlin a few days ago that Japan would return Qingdao and the Caroline Islands under trusteeship to Germany. This is precisely Japan's attempt to curry favor with Germany and intensify its collusion. In short, this "anti-communist" triangle led by Hitler, whose activities in Europe and Asia are parallel lines, has never been as exposed as it is today. Japan's attacks on British and French interests in the Far East are echoing with Italy in the Mediterranean and Germany in Central Europe. They all have the same purpose: to encircle and overthrow the two major democratic countries of Britain and France. Therefore, how urgent is the task for Britain, France, and other peaceful countries to jointly build a stronger fortress to resist the expansion of this axis or triangle today!

Observations from Chongqing

### If European War Breaks Out; Japan Will Seize Concessions; Take Parallel Action to Support Germany; Use Economic Methods to Plunder Land

(Chongqing) According to reliable military observers, once war breaks out between the totalitarian countries and democratic countries in Europe, Japan will take an offensive against Britain and France in the Far East, while taking a defensive stance against the Soviet Union, which has the possibility of an offensive. Japan's offensive against the Far East territories of Britain and France has two purposes: (1) To take parallel action to support Germany; (2) To conquer more land in the most economical way. The Japanese army intends to repeat the experience of 1915, defeating the small German garrison in Qingdao and occupying the area. Japan's current goal is to occupy all of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the French concessions in Shanghai and Hankou, the International Settlement in Shanghai and Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and the French leased territory of Guangzhou Bay. The Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is the preliminary preparation for completing its military ambitions. The Japanese army's occupation of the Spratly Islands has completed its preparations for attacking the British and French territories in the Far East. Now that the Japanese army has occupied Hainan Island and the Spratly Islands, it can prevent reinforcements and supplies from Singapore to Hong Kong. Now that the waterways to Singapore and Hong Kong have been cut off, the British troops in Shanghai and Tianjin are in a completely isolated position. Japanese statisticians believe that there are only less than twelve old-fashioned French warships along the coast of Vietnam and Guangzhou Bay, and the small number of French troops stationed in the French concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou are insufficient to be a fighting force. The Japanese believe that once war breaks out, the French forces in the Far East will have no source of reinforcements and supplies. The Japanese hope to achieve the greatest effect at the least cost, so they are not prepared to fight the Soviet Union unless the Soviet Union attacks. It is reported that Japanese Minister of War Itagaki intends to take a plane to inspect the defense fortifications in the Northeast. The Japanese troops stationed in the Northeast have increased to twenty-four divisions, totaling 500,000. Even the southern part of Sakhalin Island has two Japanese divisions stationed there. There are three Japanese divisions stationed in northern Korea. There are a total of thirteen Japanese divisions on the eastern border of the Northeast, including the Snowy Mountains on the west bank of the Ussuri River. (Associated Press dispatch on the 3rd)

### Japanese Side Continues to Block the Pearl River Under the Pretext of Military Operations; Allows British Ships Blocked in Guangzhou to Depart After Unloading Cargo

(Guangzhou) A Japanese military spokesman explained several reasons for the continued blockade of the Pearl River at his second reception for reporters here. It is claimed that military operations are still underway along the river. Secrecy is one of the keys to victory in battle, so ships are not allowed to travel to and from the areas where the Japanese army is operating. At this time, allowing ships to freely navigate the river would greatly hinder the Japanese army. The Japanese army has to frequently consider the issue of safety. The Pearl River will only be opened when military operations permit. Regarding the blocking of a small number of British ships in Guangzhou, the spokesman said that each ship was carrying cargo, and they will be allowed to depart after unloading their cargo. When answering other questions, the spokesman admitted that the order to force Chinese people to wear "good citizen badges" in order to curb crime had failed. The Japanese army and navy authorities now know that this system is ineffective and are considering abolishing it. The Japanese authorities hope to abolish the method of requiring foreigners to hold passes when entering Guangzhou from Shamian in the shortest possible time. The spokesman also said that although the local maintenance association enjoys greater freedom than similar groups in North China, the administration must listen to the guidance of a group led by a Japanese person. The Japanese person's name is Nishimura, who was formerly the director of the Local Administration Bureau of the Taiwan government. He is currently organizing a committee to handle the most difficult issue of restoring property to its original owners. Private houses that have been requisitioned by the army and navy will not be returned, but the owners will be compensated for their losses. (Dispatch on the 2nd)

### Chamberlain Re-Announces That British Policy Enters a New Era; Foreign Secretary States Importance of Friendship with the Soviet Union; Europe Finds it Hard to Forget Germany's Lessons in Betrayal

(London) Today, the House of Commons held a debate on foreign affairs, which began with a speech by Labour Deputy Leader Colin Wu. Prime Minister Chamberlain declared that Great Britain is now united and believes that whatever the outcome, we must have a clear and unambiguous position. If Germany is a good neighbor in the long run, it will not threaten others. The declaration issued by the government on Friday is the greatest new departure in Great Britain's history. We have now broken away from traditionalism. If Poland is threatened, Britain and France intend to come to its aid immediately. Germany's guarantees are like wind passing through the ears and have completely destroyed the trust of other countries, forcing Britain to take this new departure. If Germany continues its policies, it will not be just Poland that suffers. Britain welcomes any country to cooperate and resist aggression, regardless of its political system. The entire British Empire has endorsed the government's new policies and hopes that the actions already started but not completed by the government will prove to be a turning point towards a better era. (3rd Reuters)

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax emphatically stated in the House of Lords today that the British and French governments are now in extremely close contact, and the two governments are as one on all points. Halifax detailed the scope and purpose of the guarantee given to Poland by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons on February 31, and said that the British government attaches great importance to the value of friendship with the Soviet Union, but the British government should pay attention to the fact that the relations between several countries and the Soviet Union are currently very complicated. As far as the British government is concerned, there are no such disputes with the Soviet Union today. There are now several parties pointing out that the British government intends to encircle Germany, which is a great distortion of the facts. If Germany indicates that the fear of its neighbors only arises from misunderstandings of Germany's intentions, then it is difficult to expect these neighbors to completely ignore the lessons of the past. (Cheers from the crowd) The guarantee given to Poland by the British government is indeed a major new departure in British policy. This kind of constraint is by no means shouldered in any hostile spirit. Senator Snell said that he would like to assure the government that the Labor Party welcomes the government's change of policy. Senator Cree also said that he agrees with the government's new policies, but National Labor Party Senator Arnold alone dissented, saying that history will prove this to be the most unwise and dangerous decision the British government has ever made. The discussion ended as soon as the senator finished speaking. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

### Center of European Diplomacy Shifts to the British Capital; Polish Foreign Minister Arrives in London; Britain Guarantees Romania's Independence

London: Polish Foreign Minister Beck crossed the English Channel at 11 a.m. this morning and has now arrived here. (3rd Reuters)

(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Mandell, a Liberal MP from the opposition party, raised a question about the Free City of Danzig. Butler, a decision-maker at the Foreign Office, immediately replied, "Colonel Beck, the Foreign Minister of Poland, has now arrived here. When the British Cabinet members conduct talks with him, this matter will naturally be discussed, but before the talks, it is not appropriate to make any announcements. I believe you will agree. As for what can be reported at present, it is that the British government has not yet received any report from the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, regarding the High Commissioner stationed in Danzig." Conservative MP Bodbi then asked, "The Times published an editorial on the first of this month, stating that the government's guarantee to Poland does not apply to the country's current borders. I wonder if the government can also state that this statement is inaccurate?" Butler replied, "Regarding this guarantee, the Foreign Office has already issued an official statement explaining the government's views." (3rd Havas Dispatch)

(London) The local newspapers comment on the visit of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck to the UK, recognizing this as the first step in a policy of peace-loving countries uniting to resist aggression. The Times editorial states that Colonel Beck's visit to the UK will be to engage in the courageous cause of defending European law and the independence of all countries with Britain and France. European freedom has now been invaded. Democratic countries are now accepting this challenge. It is reported that Poland is prepared to negotiate with Germany on certain issues related to Danzig. We hope that both sides will conduct negotiations in a free and fair manner, as this is what Britain and France expect. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

Los Angeles: Former President of Poland, Paderewski (a world-renowned pianist), gave a speech here, stating, "The Polish people must defend their freedom with iron and blood and will never give it up easily." He greatly admired British Prime Minister Chamberlain's tireless efforts to maintain peace and still hopes that the authorities of European countries can use peaceful means to resolve all current problems. (3rd Havas Dispatch)

(Rome) People here now feel that since Britain and France have given guarantees to Poland, they have actually taken steps to guarantee other Eastern European countries. According to responsible sources, after Britain and France guarantee Romania, they will loan money to Romania to increase its air force strength. It is reported that Romania's first-line aircraft currently number only 300, and the number of pilots skilled in night flying is very small. People here hope that when Romanian Foreign Minister Gafenco visits Turkey within a week, he will discuss the issue of foreign warships having the right to pass through the Dardanelles Strait and go to Romanian ports in wartime.

(London) French Air Minister La Chambre is scheduled to come here this afternoon. According to the Liberal Party's news chronicle, after the Czech aircraft factories were controlled by Germany, Germany's aircraft manufacturing capacity has increased sharply, far exceeding previous estimates. La Chambre's trip is to study the various resources of the British and French aircraft manufacturing industries and whether they can help each other and cooperate to cope with the environment.

### The Twists and Turns of Hitler's Speech Suddenly Being Interrupted

(Berlin) German officials have now explained the reason for yesterday's decision not to broadcast Hitler's speech, saying that the time of the speech may not attract the majority of the audience, so it was decided to make a gramophone record and broadcast it during the dinner of most people. As for the sudden interruption of the broadcast on the shortwave radio station to the United States, it was due to a technical error. However, non-official sources said that Hitler had already prepared a more broadly worded speech, containing remarks about having a special relationship with the United States. Later, due to British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons, the speech was rewritten, focusing solely on Britain and deleting the points specifically related to the United States. Therefore, it was temporarily decided to stop broadcasting to the United States, but due to a technical error, part of the speech was still broadcast into the air. Hitler's speech was delivered orally, and the official original text was not published until Hitler carefully studied it on the Robley ship. However, there is not much difference between the official written speech and the speech broadcast on the gramophone record. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

### Britons Baffled by Hitler's Speech; Berlin Says the Intention Was to Mock Britain into Abandoning its Policy of Encirclement

(London) The general reaction of Britons to Hitler's speech can be summarized as follows: "Hitler has made us more confused than before, but has not made us more troubled." Some newspapers welcomed it because Hitler did not abolish the Anglo-German naval agreement and his speech did not have the great rage and belligerence expected by the outside world. Other newspapers expressed surprise because Hitler was able to exercise considerable restraint in issuing this "oral fireworks." The Sunday Express published a commentary by Baxter, calling Hitler's speech a weak reply to Chamberlain and saying that Hitler's speech was intended to comfort his own people, not for the intelligent. However, the words of blame and the completely incongruous words were only intended to please the immature hearts of the general youth who revered him as sacred for a moment. Hitler's speech can be called "self-restraint," and it was issued in a mysterious and extraordinary atmosphere. The chaotic broadcasting arrangement was bizarre. The Times stated that Hitler stated in a sad tone that he intended to threaten others and declared that what he sought was non-interference from other countries. If Hitler could put himself in others' shoes and not interfere in other countries, we would all be grateful. A careful reading of yesterday's speech did not excite or comfort people. We still have hope for preserving peace, which lies in cooperation, not isolation. Peace-loving countries, if united and not scattered, will stand invincible. (2nd Reuters)

(London) Political figures here recently declared that British public opinion has always considered the constraints accepted by Britain in Central Europe as impossible. Now, due to the guarantee of Poland, it has come to fruition. It can be seen that Prime Minister Chamberlain is the most suitable person for British politicians to accept this constraint in the name of the country. If the combination of Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey to form a group to resist future aggression and the Soviet Union providing material assistance is to be completed, Prime Minister Chamberlain is also the most suitable person. Today, the policies implemented by the British government are not only supported by political figures across the country, but also by the various autonomous regions that hesitated before the Munich Conference, which now unanimously express their support. An important figure in the Conservative Party said that the Prime Minister's position has become more consolidated, and there is no need for a change. Since the Prime Minister was deceived at the Munich Conference, he must learn from the past and make a thorough change. In short, "The Prime Minister has thoroughly realized the ineffectiveness of the policy of concession." He is naturally the most suitable person to lead the group and promote new policies in the future. (2nd Havas Dispatch)

(Berlin) Well-informed German sources said that Hitler's remarks were directed specifically at Britain and contained peaceful remarks of warning. A commentator said that Hitler wanted peace and at the same time gave a stern warning to Chamberlain's explicit or implicit policy of encirclement. The Germans do not believe that this policy is defensive. Germany is preparing for peace, but is not preparing to be encircled. Germany will never allow anyone to put a rope around its neck without acting. German newspapers all emphasized the danger of the policy of encirclement and said that Hitler has given Britain time to consider it calmly. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

Czech Republic Will Not Perish

### Former President Beneš Actively Strives to Restore the Country; New York Mayor Speaks Frankly, Saying That the Czech Republic Was Kidnapped by Bandits

Cleveland: Former President of the Czech Republic, Beneš, and Mayor of New York, LaGuardia, gave speeches here yesterday, both saying that the Czech Republic would not perish and that the Czech Republic would be able to restore its independence. Beneš said, "We will be able to win, in other words, a free Europe will be able to win, because our country is too prosperous and too democratic in the eyes of its neighbors. The dictators will never want to be neighbors with a prosperous democratic country." It is gratifying that US Deputy Secretary of State Welles recently issued a declaration refusing to recognize Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic. I do not advocate resisting violence with violence, but certain countries in Central Europe have recently followed in the footsteps of the Czech Republic and are in a state of disintegration spiritually and socially. The world has seen this and has already felt the need to curb it. Otherwise, human civilization will be completely destroyed. Mayor LaGuardia said, "I don't want to imitate diplomatic language. I will speak frankly, 'The Czech Republic did not perish because of defeat, and its republican government did not collapse. It was just kidnapped by thugs. The looters even speak of protective areas. Their actions are actually the same as kidnapping a young child and temporarily protecting it, waiting for the parents to pay the ransom. Otherwise, the ticket will be torn up. How is this different? How can this kind of crime be allowed to be exposed for a long time and then respected?'" At this point, if we can announce to the world that the American people condemn the aggressors and help the democratic countries, we can believe that war can be avoided. People are now commenting on Beneš's speech, saying that he did not involve the Czech reconstruction plan currently under study. This is probably due to keeping secrets. However, according to well-informed sources, the Czech people will organize a provisional government abroad, and the Czech embassy in foreign countries that has not yet been handed over to Germany will be the location of the provisional government.

Frequent Contacts Between Britain and Italy; Content Strictly Kept Secret

(Rome) The semi-official Stefani news agency issued a communiqué today stating that Sir Charles, the British Chargé d'Affaires, delivered the full text of Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration on the guarantee of Poland to Foreign Minister Ciano on the 31st of last month. Diplomatic circles here are now commenting on this communiqué, saying that recent rumors that the British government advocated convening an international conference to organize European peace, and Chargé d'Affaires Charles notified Foreign Minister Ciano of this intention. It is not known whether the intention of the communiqué issued by the Stefani news agency is to indirectly deny these rumors. However, since Prime Minister Chamberlain made his declaration, Chargé d'Affaires Charles and Foreign Minister Ciano have held a total of three talks. The first two talks were on the 31st of last month, and the third was yesterday morning. The agency did not mention a single word about the second and third talks, which is noteworthy. Well-informed sources said that the diplomatic activities between Britain and Italy recently are of extreme importance. It is reasonable for the Italian government to keep secrets before the negotiations between the two sides are completed. (2nd Havas)

Britain to Establish a Ministry of Supply

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the government is considering establishing a Ministry of Supply.

### Japan and Russia Establish Temporary Fisheries Agreement; Valid Until the End of This Year; Russia Recovers 27 Fishing Grounds

(Moscow) The Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement was signed on April 2 by Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and Japanese Ambassador Togo, with a limited period until the end of 1939. At the same time, the auction of fishing grounds originally scheduled to be held in Vladivostok on April 3 has been postponed to April 4 for technical reasons. (3rd Tass Dispatch)

(Moscow) The Soviet Union and Japan have now reached an agreement to slightly revise the 1928 Fisheries Treaty and extend its validity for one year. The fisheries dispute has thus come to an end. According to Japanese sources, when the Soviet authorities auction 254 fishing grounds in Vladivostok Port on the 4th of this month, Japanese fisheries will also participate. The operating period of these fishing grounds has been set for one year. Another 105 will be subject to special agreements between the two parties, allowing Japanese companies to operate for a term of one year. There are still 27 that were originally operated by Japanese companies and have been taken back by the Soviet Union to be operated independently (the Soviet Union originally wanted to take back 40). The rent paid by the Japanese side has been increased by 10 percent, an increase of 300,000 yen. It is also said that the fishing grounds originally operated by the Japanese can be taken back by the Soviet Union to be operated independently. This has been recognized by the Japanese side. That is, the 105 fishing grounds allowed to be operated by the Japanese are not as valuable as the 27 taken back. In addition, the Japanese side has always refused to accept the principle of price-cutting, but now it has made concessions. All of this is where the Soviet Union's victory lies.

Belgian Parliament Re-Election Results; Pro-German Faction Suffers a Miserable Defeat

Beijing: The re-election of the Belgian Senate and House of Representatives has now been completed. According to the official final report, the number of seats held by each party in the two houses is as follows:

House of Representatives, a total of 202 seats, Catholic Party 73 seats increased by 10 seats Social Democratic Party 64 seats decreased by 6 seats Liberal Party 23 seats increased by 10 seats Flemish Nationalist Party 17 seats increased by 1 seat Communist Party 9 seats remained the same Rex party 4 seats decreased by 17 seats Independent Party 1 seat New Joined Legion Representative 1 seat New Joined Senate total of 101 seats Catholic Party 38 seats increased by 4 seats Social Democratic Party 35 seats decreased by 4 seats Liberal Party 16 seats increased by 5 seats Flemish Party 8 seats increased by 3 seats Communist Party 3 seats decreased by 1 seat Lech Party 1 seat decreased by 7 seats Representatives of the Provincial Councils 44 seats, not yet elected,

Occupational Proportional Representation 22 seats, announced on April 12th. (3rd Haitong Dispatch)

Beijing: Regarding the re-election of the Belgian Senate and House of Representatives, political figures here commented today, believing that there are several characteristics: (1) The success of the Catholic Party, with an increase of 10 seats in the House of Representatives and an increase of 4 seats in the Senate, becoming the most powerful party in both houses; (2) The decline of the Communist Party; (3) The miserable defeat of the Rex Party, but the party leader Degrelle was elected as a member of the House of Representatives for the first time; (4) The expansion of the Liberal Party, with an increase of 10 seats in the House of Representatives and an increase of 5 seats in the Senate. As a result, if the Catholic Party unites with the Liberal Party, it will become an absolute majority, so it is expected that the two parties will form a coalition cabinet. (3rd Haitong Dispatch)

Beijing: The characteristic of this election is the great failure of the Lex Party, which has dropped from 21 seats to 4 seats. This party does not have a concrete political program in diplomacy, but its attitude is friendly to Germany and opposes the League of Nations. The party leader Degrelle is accused of wanting to establish a dictatorship, but Degrelle denies it. However, it is generally believed that the purpose of the Lex movement is to create a kind of dictatorial state. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

Former Polish Prime Minister Suddenly Commits Suicide

Warsaw: Former Polish Prime Minister Colonel Sławek suddenly committed suicide last night for unknown reasons. According to historical accounts, Mr. Sławek was a confidant of the late Polish President General Piłsudski, 59 years old, and has made many contributions to Poland's independence and revolutionary movement. In 1900, he met Piłsudski for the first time in Łódź and joined the work of resisting Russian rule. During the World War, he was repeatedly promoted to important positions under Piłsudski. After 1918, he was actually responsible for organizing the army. He then replaced Piłsudski to form a "non-party group" and occupied a very powerful position in the parliament. After 1930, Mr. Sławek served as Prime Minister of the Cabinet three times. He left his political career last year and went to a villa near Kielce, a gift from the state, to recuperate.

### A GlimPSE BEFORE THE FALL OF MADRID

ANDAYE, SOUTHERN FRANCE - The situation in the Spanish city of Madrid in the last few days before the Nationalist troops entered was personally witnessed by a Havas News Agency reporter. According to the reporter, who arrived here today, the sudden fall of the city was actually due to the fact that the former Republican government had already advocated peace talks, which led to wavering public sentiment and an eager hope for peace, forming a kind of mass psychology that peace would end the daily air raid terrors, food would flow in, and daily life would no longer be precarious. Therefore, after the suppression of the Communist Party incident, soldiers stationed on the front lines and in various military camps, as well as workers in various ordnance factories, deserted their posts one after another, and there was a sense of stagnation in the market. Unexpectedly, the peace talks ultimately failed. The Republican government authorities held repeated meetings, and opinions were divided, with disputes becoming increasingly fierce. Initially, when the anarchist faction sponsored the formation of the National Defense Committee, there was an understanding that those not tolerated by the Nationalist troops should be given sufficient time to retreat at ease before the Nationalist troops arrived. Later, because various countries were unwilling to accept these people, the meetings came to nothing. Finally, Foreign Minister Pascual and Army Minister Colonel Casado rose up to support the precarious situation, believing that they could ultimately obtain an honorable peace. However, the result was again not the case. The Nationalist troops adopted a tough stance, with absolutely no room for compromise. Until the 25th of last month, those not tolerated by the Nationalist troops received orders to leave the city. At the same time, government troops engaged in eliminating traitors also withdrew one after another. Soon after, the Republican government received an ultimatum issued by General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist troops, demanding unconditional surrender. Prime Minister Miaja then, at 4:00 AM the next morning, led General Matallana, chief of staff of the Central Army, and flew to Valencia. The hope for peace talks was thus clearly dashed. By the evening of the 26th, the Republican government authorities issued a communiqué, announcing the other side's ultimatum and the Prime Minister's flight. The next day, the general situation in Madrid, although no different from the past, saw soldiers fleeing constantly. Even officers at all levels found it difficult to leave the city. When Colonel Casado heard the news, he initially planned to prohibit all cars from leaving the city. However, because public panic reached its peak, the ban was as good as a dead letter. By the evening of the 27th, Colonel Casado, seeing that the situation was hopeless, accepted the ultimatum. At that time, out of the 50,000 government troops on the front lines of Madrid, more than half had fled. Only 23,000 remained, still stationed in their original defenses. The Nationalist troops' entry by taking advantage of the situation was entirely possible. All extremist elements would inevitably take the opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, they appealed to Viglison, leader of the Falange Party, who had been in hiding for thirteen months, to come forward to maintain order. At the same time, a movement to support General Franco began, the aim being that, when the Nationalist troops entered the city, they would not resume fighting. At this point, Colonel Casado left the city, leaving only Foreign Minister Pascual to deal with the aftermath (he is currently detained by the Nationalist authorities). That evening, all members of the Falange Party in Madrid secretly mobilized. Red berets and flags of the Restoration faction were simultaneously seen throughout the city. By dawn on the 28th, residents woke up to see a white flag hoisted high on the roof of the Information Bureau, fluttering in the wind. They looked at each other sadly. At that time, those who supported the Nationalist troops cheered as if they were in ecstasy, rushing to the embassies of various countries, shouting "Long live General Franco!" "Long live Spain!" And rumors of the signing of a peace treaty spread throughout the city. Soon after, a first batch of children, mostly girls, rode together in a truck, driving through the streets, shouting "Long live General Franco!" However, the city's residents, having endured long periods of artillery fire, took it all calmly. By 2:00 PM, the situation in the city had calmed down slightly. Soon after, supporters of the Nationalist troops gathered again, with three to four thousand residents from across the city participating. By 6:00 PM, the vanguard of the Nationalist troops entered the city, and by 9:00 PM that evening, they had occupied the entire city. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)

MADRID - According to information obtained here, after the Nationalist troops occupied Madrid, they detained 300,000 former government soldiers in concentration camps near Madrid, including many former members of the International Brigades, mostly volunteers from Russia, France, Belgium, and the United States. The number of former government officials arrested reached over 2,000, including National Defense Council member Pascual, Prime Minister's Office Secretary Guerra, and two political police chiefs.

(CHONGQING) The National Government issued an order on the 3rd, stating that the Executive Yuan reported that Dai Jiufeng, magistrate of Fengyang County, Anhui Province, had organized teams and fought hard in the resistance war, repeatedly achieving meritorious service. All the subsidies he received were transferred to public use, without saving any private funds, resulting in his family taking refuge in Hunan Province, facing hardship and hunger, which is truly commendable. The Military Affairs Commission has been consulted and agreed that he should be rewarded. He is to be reviewed and implemented accordingly. Magistrate Dai Jiufeng is loyal, courageous in resisting the enemy, and forgets his family for the sake of the country, which is highly commendable. He should be promoted to show encouragement.

SOUTHWESTERN FACTORIES SPRING UP

### GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHES MANAGEMENT OFFICE IN XIKANG PROVINCE - TO MINE GOLD - 300 FACTORIES MOVE INLAND - OVERSEAS CHINESE INVEST IN MINING DEVELOPMENT

Chongqing correspondence from the Continental News on March 19th states that the resources and raw materials in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces are extremely abundant. Before the Sino-Japanese War, few people inquired about them. Now, state-owned and private factories are being established one after another, and their number is increasing daily. This can serve as a concrete example of the gradual industrialization of southwestern China. From October of last year to March of this year, government agencies have established no fewer than 12 large factories, with a total capital of tens of millions of yuan. There are also some other factories that will soon be opened. In addition, there are at least

300 factories

that have moved in from overseas and the provinces of Central China. According to this, the remote inland provinces have enjoyed peace and tranquility for several centuries. Today, this traditional tranquility has been invaded by the roar of machines and the activities of workers. This action is particularly noticeable in Sichuan Province, where China's factory construction process has achieved considerable results. The most important of the factories established in the inland provinces are some state-owned hydroelectric plants, ordnance factories, gasoline and alcohol plants, and other war industries in western and eastern Sichuan Province. The largest of the private factories is the Chongqing Iron Company not far from Chongqing, and the Sichuan Sericulture Company, a joint venture between the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the provincial authorities, with a capital of 4 million yuan. Currently under construction is a sugar refinery of a similar nature, with a capital of 3 million yuan. The Sichuan-Xikang Wool Factory has an initial capital of 300,000 yuan, cotton mills that weave high-quality fabrics, and alcohol manufacturing plants that produce more alcohol and mixed gasoline. As for the prosperous industries of the border province of Yunnan, they are concentrated in

mining work

. The Yunnan Northern Mining Management Office, organized by the National Resources Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the provincial government, has already adopted new-style mining and refining methods to increase the production of copper in China's largest copper production center. At the same time, the Management Office is building a hydroelectric plant in the province. When completed in two years, it will supply electricity to the entire province of Yunnan. This large-scale program to electrify the entire province of Yunnan requires an expenditure of 6 million yuan. Yunnan Province is known for its tin and lead production. Only a few months ago, it was still mined using centuries-old methods. Now, scientific methods are also being used for mining. In the near future, overseas Chinese investors will invest 50 million yuan to establish a development company. The mining industry in this border province is expected to develop greatly. The leading figure in promoting the realization of this plan is China's

industrial magnate

from the Straits Settlements, Ou Benhua (transliteration). The Xinhua Chemical Products Factory (transliteration), organized by many industrialists from Shanghai and Guangzhou in Kunming, has already used local raw materials to manufacture large quantities of chemical products. The cotton mill established by the Yunnan Provincial Economic Commission at a cost of 1.25 million yuan is now selling its cheap and high-quality fabrics and cotton yarn in markets over a wide area. The government's efforts to develop another part of the Northwest Group will be applied to Guizhou Province, focusing on the development of the province's rich mineral resources. Guizhou Province accounts for three of China's four major mercury-producing areas, with the fourth in western Hunan. An investment of 400,000 yuan will now be used to increase

mercury production

, and another 200,000 yuan will be used to improve sales and transportation facilities. This industry will be organized by the provincial government with the economic and technical cooperation of the National Resources Commission. The Guizhou Mining Management Office will guide it. In March, according to a sleeve report issued by the Guizhou Provincial Government Investigation Department, eight ounces of gold were extracted from one ton of quartz used as a sample. This sounds impossible, but it must be remembered that the natives of the province often discover large amounts of gold using primitive placer mining methods. Until recently, no systematic method has been tried to determine important mineral veins. Xikang, China's new province, is also trending towards industrialization. Because of its

abundant gold production

, it has attracted many wealthy and enterprising industrialists in China to develop it. The Gold Mine Management Office organized by the government has already selected an area in eastern Xikang as an important center for mining this precious metal. Factories that use famous wool manufacturing items have already begun work. At the same time, the possibility of mining the abundant coal mines in this border province is also being studied. The Kaiyang Coal Mine Company (transliteration), managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, may soon be able to use the privilege of using the machinery of the famous Xiangtan coal-producing area in Hunan Province. The Xiangtan coal-producing area is approaching the war zone and is not suitable for continued work.

### JAPANESE WARSHIPS CONSTANTLY HARASS EASTERN FUJIAN - LIANJIANG COUNTY REPEATEDLY BOMBED - FUZHOU AND QUANZHOU ALSO DAMAGED

Fuzhou Correspondence: From March 1st to 10th, Japanese warships harassed the coastal counties of Haicheng, Tong'an, Jinjiang, Hui'an, and Putian in southern Fujian. In addition to shelling Xiamen in Tong'an and Haicang in Haicheng, they also dispatched aircraft from the ships to bomb Xiutu and Luoyang in Hui'an, Xunpu and Xinmen in Jinjiang, Xiamen in Tong'an, and the urban area of Longxi County. However, due to the strict defense by the Chinese army, more than 20 civilians were killed or injured, and more than ten houses were destroyed. They also looted several civilian ships on the sea. The Japanese warships, realizing their failure, all nine ships, left on the morning of the 10th. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the same day, seven Japanese warships arrived outside the mouth of the Minjiang River in Fuzhou, anchoring in the waters of Baiquan Yang, Nangan Tang, Dongsha Island, and Meihua Port. In recent days, they have been harassing the coastal counties of Lianjiang, Changle, and Minhou in eastern Fujian. The details of the events are described below:

On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese warships first lowered several speedboats, patrolling various ports. They intercepted and burned a civilian ship in the waters of Xiaocheng in Lianjiang County. Then, they sent an aircraft to raid Changmen, dropping five bombs, all of which landed on barren mountains. On the morning of the 11th, they sent another aircraft to raid Guantou, dropping three bombs, destroying a boat and killing one person and injuring two others on the wharf. On the morning of the 12th, four of the Japanese warships anchored at the mouth of the Minjiang River left, leaving three anchored at Nangan Tang and Baiquan Yang. At 6:00 AM on the morning of the 13th, the Japanese warship anchored at Nangan Tang lowered two speedboats, intercepting two civilian ships on the sea. They immediately dispatched sailors to board the two ships, forcing the crew to drive the ships on their behalf. The two speedboats led the way, arriving at Dinghai in Lianjiang County. More than 20 Japanese soldiers sneaked ashore, set the house of the Lianbao director on fire, and fled back to the speedboats. On the way, they fired dozens of machine guns at the shore of Xiaocheng. At 6:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, a Japanese aircraft taking off from Xiamen dropped three bombs at Liuwudian in Tong'an County, all of which landed on barren land. At 10:30 AM on the morning of the 16th, the Japanese warship anchored at Nangan Tang lowered two speedboats, sailing to Xiaocheng in Lianjiang County, intercepting two civilian ships, setting the ships on fire, and killing all the crew members. At 7:00 AM on the morning of the 16th, four more Japanese warships arrived at the mouth of the Minjiang River, anchoring at Furen Island and Dongsha Island. At 3:00 PM, they lowered three speedboats, advancing towards Xiaocheng, and opening fire with machine guns on the shore. The Chinese defenders waited for them to approach before returning fire. Several Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded before they retreated. At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th, the four Japanese warships anchored at Furen Island and Dongsha Island sailed away, leaving three anchored between Baiquan Yang and Nangan Tang. On the 18th, due to heavy rain and fog, there were no unusual movements. On the 19th, eight Japanese warships were discovered on the sea off Xiamen. Also, the Japanese artillery at the Gaoqi battery in Xiamen fired more than ten shells and hundreds of machine gun rounds at Jimei in Tong'an County, all of which landed on the beach. At 1:00 PM on the 20th, the Japanese troops at the Gaoqi battery in Xiamen fired five more shells at Aotou in Tong'an County. At 1:00 PM on the 21st, four Japanese aircraft dispatched by the Japanese warships at the mouth of the Minjiang River invaded Fuzhou, dropping two bombs at Taijiang, injuring two people and collapsing one house. They dropped five bombs at Dongmendou, injuring one person. They dropped three bombs at Jintai Road, collapsing one house. They dropped four bombs outside the Water Gate. At 6:00 AM on the 22nd, three Japanese warships anchored at the mouth of the Minjiang River sailed two ships to the sea off Hui'an in southern Fujian. At 9:30 AM, four aircraft took off from the warships and flew to Jinjiang, dropping twelve bombs outside the South Gate, landing near the Bank of China, the Telegraph Bureau, and the Salt Warehouse, collapsing fifteen houses, killing eight people, and injuring ten. They also turned back to Hui'an, opening fire with machine guns in the city, killing two people and injuring three. They then flew to Putian County, dropping four bombs at Sanjiangkou, collapsing one house and injuring one person. At 0:30 PM, the four Japanese aircraft finally flew back to the warships off Hui'an from Putian. One of them, due to engine trouble, landed on the sea off Putian. By evening, two speedboats dispatched by the Japanese warships off Hui'an towed it away. On the same day, a Japanese spy disguised as a beggar was captured at the wharf in Hanjiang Commercial Port (under the jurisdiction of Putian County). He could speak Japanese and Minnan dialect. He was immediately sent to the Putian County Government for interrogation. His origin is still under investigation. At 7:00 AM on the morning of the 23rd, two more Japanese warships arrived at the mouth of the Minjiang River, anchoring at Baiquan Yang. At 0:10 PM, three aircraft took off, reconnoitering the Changmen, Chuanshi, and Guantou areas at the mouth of the Minjiang River for more than 20 minutes before landing on the warships. Currently, there are three Japanese warships outside the mouth of the Minjiang River, two off the coast of Hui'an, and eight off the coast of Xiamen.

### PROMOTING THE EXPORT OF DOMESTIC GOODS - SOUTHWESTERN CUSTOMS BECOME THE FOCUS - TAX ADMINISTRATION TRANSFERS A LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMS OFFICERS - POST-WAR EXPORTS INCREASE MORE THAN PRE-WAR

After the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance made every effort to promote the export of domestic goods, trade in the southwestern customs of Mengzi, Longzhou, and Tengyue improved. The Director-General of Customs has transferred a large number of customs officers to work. Exports of domestic goods have increased more after the war than before, concentrated in Hong Kong, and then transferred to various countries overseas. The details are as follows:

INTENTION TO PROMOTE THE EXPORT OF DOMESTIC GOODS

After making every effort to promote the export of domestic goods, the export of major domestic goods, such as tung oil, tea, animals and animal products, mineral sands, and textiles, has increased more than before the war, and has not decreased sharply due to transportation obstacles. For example, 57,580,900 yuan in 1935, 70,574,100 yuan in 1936, 83,825,600 yuan in 1937, and 76,264,100 yuan in 1938, which is enough to prove that the export of domestic goods after the war has increased more than before the war. The goods are ranked first in textiles, first in animals and animal products, and third in mineral sands and metal products.

EXPORTS FROM SOUTHWESTERN CUSTOMS INCREASE DRAMATICALLY

Major domestic goods have been managed by the Trade Commission, exported from the southwestern and Zhejiang-Fujian customs, concentrated in Hong Kong, and then transshipped to various countries. As a result, exports from the southwestern customs have increased dramatically. For example, Longzhou Customs was 37,000 yuan in August of last year and 2,128,000 yuan in February of this year, Mengzi Customs was 1,312,000 yuan in August of last year and 1,982,000 yuan in February of this year, Tengyue Customs was 171,000 yuan in August of last year and 600,600 yuan in February of this year, Simao Customs was 477 yuan in August of last year and 27,000 yuan in February of this year, and Shantou Customs was 3,421,000 yuan in August of last year and 4,460,000 yuan in February of this year.

LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMS OFFICERS DISPATCHED TO THE SOUTHWEST

In view of the fact that the center of gravity of China's export trade has shifted to the southwestern customs after the war, Director-General of Customs Mei Lehe has been informed by the tax officials of Longzhou, Mengzi, Tengyue, Simao, and other customs that, due to the sharp increase in export goods, the original customs officers are insufficient to be allocated, and they have requested that additional customs officers be sent to work at the various customs. Director-General Mei recently transferred customs officers to go, including several Chinese deputy tax officials. As for Ningbo and Wenzhou in Zhejiang, Quanzhou in Fujian, and Shantou in Guangdong, customs officers have recently been increased. Most of these customs officers have been evacuated from the customs in the occupied areas.

SPECIALLY APPROVED TAX-FREE EXPORT OF DOMESTIC GOODS

A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Customs yesterday that, in order to promote the export of domestic goods and enrich the foundation of foreign exchange, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have decided that major domestic goods, such as tung oil, hog bristles, leather, fur goods, tea, mineral sands, gallnuts, medicinal herbs, wool, silk, ramie, casings, and feathers, shall be exported tax-free. Therefore, the tax-free export goods from the southwestern customs have increased dramatically. For example, in February of this year, Longzhou was 914,000 yuan, Mengzi was 110,000 yuan, Tengyue was 569,000 yuan, Shantou was 1,615,000 yuan, Wenzhou was 276,000 yuan, and Simao was 200,000 yuan.

### CHAIRMAN CHIANG REITERATES LAWS AND REGULATIONS - URGES SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS TO DEFEND THE LAND AND RESIST INVASION - VOWS TO LEAD THE NATION'S SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS TO FIGHT TO THE DEATH - TO COMPLETE THE GREAT CAUSE OF RESISTANCE AND NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION

The Military Affairs Commission issued an order to the authorities of the various provinces, stating: "As the War of Resistance enters its second stage, which is also the period for striving for final victory, if we can hold the determination to win and confront the enemy, victory will ultimately belong to us. This Chairman, entrusted by the Party and the nation, vows to lead the nation's soldiers and civilians to fight to the death. Those who can defend the land and resist invasion and fulfill their duties will be rewarded by the state, and generous rewards will be given without hesitation. Those who retreat without authorization, are cowardly and neglect their duties will be severely punished according to the express provisions of the law. All matters concerning rewards and punishments have been repeatedly promulgated in laws and regulations. At this critical time, the laws and regulations are reiterated to complete the great cause of resistance and national construction."

### Japanese Monopolization of Water and Land Cargo Transportation; Squeezing Out Foreign Business Interests; British, German, and Italian Merchant Ships Have Almost No Cargo to Load; Currently, They Are Jointly Planning Coping Measures

The Japanese attempt to control shipping on the Yangtze River and inland waterways has been decisively realized through their special force. Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (Japan Mail Steamship Company) has dispatched ships to operate at various downstream ports, beginning to load cargo and passengers. Land transportation on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line has also reduced fees to solicit passengers and goods, resulting in various foreign ships being squeezed under the pressure of these Japanese and puppet vehicles. Furthermore, difficulties are created in issuing "Removal Permits," leading to sluggish cargo transportation, with each voyage reporting losses. The following details the situation:

Nisshin Merchant Ships Begin Operations

The Japanese, through active planning, have gradually realized their attempt to control shipping on the Yangtze River downstream (Jiangnan Line) from Shanghai to Jiangyin, and (Jiangbei Line) from Shanghai to Qinglong Port. At various ports along the river, such as Liuhe, Yanglin, Qiya, Baiyuan, Hupu, Changyinsha, Fushan, Niantuogang, and Zhanghuanggang, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha has added five merchant ships since the end of last month, beginning to carry passengers and load cargo. Because the company had previously coordinated with the Shanghai military authorities and the Japanese army and navy stationed in various locations along the river, "Removal Permits" for passengers and goods booked on Japanese ships can be issued at any time, without inspection or detention along the way. As for Qinglong Port on the Jiangbei Line, since the Japanese army stationed there, it has been hindering foreign ships in every possible way, causing foreign merchant ships to abandon cargo transportation to that port. Nisshin Kisen Kaisha has taken the opportunity to rise, initially with only one Japanese ship operating, but now it has increased the number of sailings.

Reducing Freight Rates to Compete for Business

In addition to seizing the shipping business of foreign merchants along the Yangtze River, the Japanese are also attempting to completely eliminate all the rights and interests of foreign shipping. Given that the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha ships are insufficient to meet the demand on various lines, they have drastically reduced freight rates for land transportation on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, so that various goods from the interior will not be transported to the river to be loaded onto ships, but can instead be loaded onto trains. At the same time, various small inland ships have also been controlled by the Inland Waterways Shipping Company, newly established by Nisshin Kisen Kaisha. Under the special force of the Japanese, water and land transportation has been completely monopolized. The goal is to drive out foreign shipping in the future, and then arbitrarily raise freight rates, squeezing merchants and civilians.

Foreign Ships Suffer from Double Pressure and Losses

British, German, Italian, Portuguese, and other foreign merchant ships have suffered a sudden drop in business as a result of this double pressure. Moreover, the Japanese are creating difficulties in issuing Removal Permits for passengers and goods shipped on foreign ships. Since mid-last month, foreign ships operating along the Yangtze River have had almost no cargo to load on each voyage, resulting in significant losses. According to investigations by a reporter from the Modern News Agency, authorities from various foreign shipping companies have jointly held several meetings to discuss concrete measures to negotiate with the Japanese authorities. Among the foreign merchants, the two British companies, Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson, have suffered the most from Japanese pressure. Although the Japanese appear more accommodating to German and Italian merchants on the surface, the actual loss of rights and interests is no different. Therefore, foreign merchants, understanding the Japanese scheme and because their business interests are the same, are actively planning coping measures.

Jiaxing: The Urgency of War

Chaotic Situation and Suspended Sailings

A fierce guerrilla war has broken out in Jiaxing, with the guerrillas controlling all the major towns in the surrounding countryside and advancing to the outskirts of the city. They are currently adopting an encirclement strategy, and will begin the attack as soon as preparations are complete. The Japanese army in the city has erected cannons and machine guns on the city walls. A battle could erupt at any moment. A ship that recently departed from Shanghai to Jiaxing failed to arrive due to the chaotic situation there and has returned. The Shanghai-Jiaxing sailings have now been suspended.

Two Japanese Warships Invade Haimen, Apparently with Plans to Land

At the ports of Haimen and Qidong in northern Jiangsu, Japanese warships had previously harassed the area and attempted to land several times without success. According to recent news from the shipping industry, on the first of this month, Japanese troops from the Three Factories area once again attacked the Chinese positions, but were repelled by the brave resistance of the Chinese army. On the morning of the second, two Japanese warships sailed to the outside of Haimen Port, dispatching two small motorboats carrying dozens of Japanese soldiers to patrol the coast, apparently with plans to land. They also used machine guns to strafe the area. Local troops, who had already taken strict precautions, were prepared. Seeing that they were prepared, the Japanese left. The Jiangsu provincial authorities have ordered the troops stationed at the various ports of Haimen to step up their defenses and strike hard at any time.

### The Customs Allows the Transshipment of Miscellaneous Grains and Their Products; However, Justification Must Be Provided and Prior Approval Obtained; All Approved Transshipments Are Fully Exempt from Duty

After the Ministry of Finance prohibited the export and transshipment of miscellaneous grains and their products to the occupied areas, special permission was granted for transshipment to non-occupied areas with full exemption from transshipment duties. Due to the special circumstances of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, transshipment is now permitted, but prior approval must be requested. The details are as follows:

Transshipment of Miscellaneous Grains is Exempt from Duty

According to the Customs Transshipment Duty Regulations of the Republic of China, Category 2, miscellaneous grains and their products: No. 45, bran; No. 46, buckwheat; No. 47, miscellaneous grain flour, A. wheat flour (including wheat bran), B. unnamed miscellaneous grain flour (including potato flour); No. 48, sorghum; No. 49, corn; No. 50, millet; No. 51, rice; No. 52, seed cakes (including broken cakes and powder), A. soybean cake, B. cottonseed cake, C. peanut cake, D. rapeseed cake, E. others; No. 53, wheat; No. 54, unnamed miscellaneous grains. The Ministry of Finance has now ordered a complete prohibition on their export and transshipment to occupied areas, and special permission has been granted for full tax exemption on transshipment to non-occupied areas.

Shanghai Customs Must Approve in Advance

According to news from Jianghai Customs, Jianghai Customs had previously received orders from the Ministry of Finance to completely prohibit the export of miscellaneous grains and their products. The issue of transshipment has now been approved. However, because the Shanghai Jianghai Customs is in a special situation, and its area is already an occupied area, anyone wishing to transship, whether to occupied or non-occupied areas, must state the reason for the transshipment and provide all supporting documents. Prior approval must be obtained from the Jianghai Customs before customs clearance for transshipment is permitted, and in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Finance, full tax exemption on transshipment will be granted. It is reported that some relief rice for refugees, with proof from the concession authorities, has been approved for loading and transshipment.

### The Japanese Are Planning to Build a Giant Fortress in Wusong; Japanese Attempt to Cross the Yanglinkou Again Fails; A Company of Puppet Troops in Xinlonghua Defects

The Japanese "Central China General Headquarters" is building a giant fortress on the original site of the Wusong Fort, along with a radio station. A large amount of cement, steel, and stones have been transported there recently, and construction has already begun. It is expected that the project will be completed in October, at a cost of over three million. According to the Japanese, after the completion of this giant fortress, it will be more than sufficient to control the doors of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

Attempt to Cross the Yanglinkou Fails

More than a hundred Japanese soldiers, traveling in over ten small motorboats, have repeatedly attempted to cross the Yanglinkou, but have been repelled by the guerrillas, so they have not yet succeeded. Still unwilling to give up, they erected a pontoon bridge the night before last (the 1st), attempting to invade. This was discovered by the guerrilla sentries, who ambushed them in the fields, launching a head-on attack as the Japanese landed. They also used intense machine gun fire, causing heavy casualties to the unprepared Japanese army. The surviving enemy could not withstand the attack and fled in disarray, leaving behind many weapons. The Yanglinkou is still guarded by the guerrillas.

Puppet Troops in the Southern District Defect

A company of over 150 men from the puppet "Pacification Army" in Xinlonghua in the southern district, unable to withstand the oppression of the Japanese army, defected the night before last (the 2nd), carrying all their weapons. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese garrison quickly dispatched troops to pursue them. A fierce battle ensued, resulting in the Japanese army being defeated and retreating. The company then fled westward, reportedly joining the guerrillas in preparation for wiping out the Japanese army.

Dense Gunfire in the Suburbs of Shanghai

Extreme Tension in Beixinjing Yesterday Morning

Many Rumors in the Southern District

Around 4:00 AM on the third, dense gunfire suddenly erupted in the Beixinjing area, accompanied by the sound of small mortars. Residents were awakened from their sleep, and rumors spread that guerrillas had infiltrated and were engaging in combat. Around 6:00 AM, a large number of Japanese troops were dispatched to search homes and pedestrians. A small steamship with dozens of armed Japanese soldiers patrolled the river surface in the area, inspecting boats. As a result, a large number of boats docked in the Beixinjing area on the morning of the third crowded into the Suzhou Creek.

Around 11:00 PM on the evening of the second, clear gunfire was suddenly heard in the southern district, seemingly coming from the Xinlonghua area, leading to many rumors in the area. The Japanese army has strengthened its defenses in the southern district. At the junction of western Shanghai and the southern district, the Japanese army has ordered residents to rearrange the barbed wire fences. Inspections at the docks have also become very strict.

### Ma Xiangbo's 100th Birthday; Celebrations Ordered in All Regions; Expanded Celebrations in This City; Fundraising for Disaster Relief

In addition to holding a celebration at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association on the afternoon of the 6th, various circles in this city will also hold three days of broadcast celebrations from the 5th to the 7th, giving away badges and raising funds for relief. The broadcast schedule and programs have been determined as follows: April 5th, Continental Radio Station, a grand performance by famous Peking Opera singers and actors; April 6th, Great Asia Radio Station, Suzhou ballads, Peking comedy, Shanghai local operas, Shanghai opera, stories; April 7th, China-West Radio Station, Yue opera, Siming local opera, southern opera, plays, comedy, singing, storytelling and ballad singing.

### Rumors of Illegal Actions by the Puppet Regime; Special Court Under Strict Guard; Large Numbers of Detectives and Garrison Troops Dispatched; Close Protection of the Court Creates a Tense Situation

The agreement between the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Consular Corps regarding the court in the concessions began its fourth period on April 1st of this year. According to the contents of the agreement, if neither party gives notice of termination or modification within six months, the agreement can be extended for three years and remain in effect. Therefore, all administrative organizations of the two courts in the Special District remain as before, with no changes. The Special District First Court has been under tight security for days due to rumors of illegal actions by the puppet organization. Yesterday, new rumors suddenly arose, stating that a large number of puppet officials, protected by armed Japanese troops, would be dispatched by the puppet "Municipal Government" to the Special District First Court to take it over. To prevent this from happening, the concession authorities dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives yesterday, along with Scottish troops stationed at the court, to implement emergency precautions and provide protection. In addition to armed police patrolling the area, the iron gates were tightly closed, with only a small door left open for entry and exit. Public officials or parties involved in civil and criminal lawsuits were required to present proof of identity when entering the court. Those with spectator tickets and unrelated individuals were subjected to strict questioning. Armed detectives were also stationed in each civil and criminal court to provide close protection. Therefore, the situation at the court was extremely tense yesterday. However, no unexpected incidents occurred until evening. It is understood that these emergency precautions will continue today and are not expected to be lifted for the time being.

Serious Disaster in Xuyi, Anhui Province

Difficult to Plant Second Crop of Wheat; No Harvest at Noon

No Food or Fuel; People Are About to Starve to Death

The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee at 97 Renji Road in this city received a report yesterday from local public organizations and representatives of disaster victims in Xuyi County, Anhui Province, stating that the disaster in the county is severe, with lives in imminent danger, urgently requiring relief. The report is recorded as follows: Xuyi, Anhui Province, is located in the lower reaches of the Wei River, bordering Hongze Lake. In recent years, droughts and floods have been frequent, and the people have been displaced and their vitality exhausted. Fortunately, the National Government, the Committee, and major philanthropists have allocated funds to provide relief, saving tens of thousands of people. Their kindness and benevolence are still remembered and praised today. Last summer, continuous rain caused a disaster. The Huai River rose sharply, the Yellow River breached its dikes, and the river was blocked, with no way to discharge the water. The water flowed horizontally and back, causing fields and homes to be submerged and family property to be destroyed. Countless people and livestock were swept away by the waves. In addition, the wind howled and the waves surged, causing significant losses to people's lives and property. Since autumn, the water level has not decreased. Although the water level decreased slightly in winter, it rose and fell erratically, and the second crop of wheat has not yet been planted. There is no hope for a harvest at noon this year. Since the beginning of spring this year, there has been continuous overcast and rainy weather. The 50,000 households in Xuyi have no food or fuel and are about to starve to death. All the cattle have been slaughtered and sold, and there is no way to obtain money. No one can afford to lend grain. If relief is not requested, the remaining people will be in a desperate situation. In addition to requesting relief from the National Government, we also hope that philanthropists in Shanghai will allocate relief funds to save the lives of tens of thousands of people.

Slight Increase in Retail Rice Prices; Reason

After the Rice Merchants Association in this city decided to add a commission and miscellaneous transportation fees of 40 cents per picul for retail sales, effective April 1st, it caused misunderstandings from the outside. Yesterday, a reporter from the Modern News Agency specially visited Zhang Nianxuan, a leader in the rice industry, to inquire about the details. According to his reply, since the end of February this year, rice prices in Shanghai have gradually risen. At that time, it was still the middle of the first month of the lunar calendar. Since each store had some inventory at the end of the year, the high rice prices were either due to the scarcity of the source due to rainy weather, or a temporary shortage. Once the weather cleared and the supply surged, prices would return to normal. Therefore, they strongly urged their colleagues to endure the pain and sacrifice to maintain the price limit. However, the goods purchased by each store last year have now been sold out, and the market price of newly purchased goods has reached the price limit, and the arrival of goods is still scarce every day, and the rising price trend is prolonged and there is no sign of a decline. How can we continue to bear the losses for a long time? Therefore, in order to maintain our own business, we have added a commission and miscellaneous transportation fees of 40 cents per picul, which is a last resort.

Change of豆米 (Bean and Rice) Market Admission Certificates; Summer Certificates to Be Issued

Market guarantee and penalty measures have been implemented. The Shanghai Bean and Rice Market Management Committee issued Public Announcement No. 65 yesterday to exchange admission certificates. According to the notice, the Brokers' Business Scope and Guarantee and Penalty Measures, agreed upon by the Bean and Rice Trade Association, will be implemented from April 1st. This has already been announced in the market. Now, the Spring Admission Certificates will expire on the 15th of this month, and the Summer Admission Certificates will be exchanged on a scheduled basis. All those who have obtained a Broker's Certificate must immediately obtain an application form from the Northern Office, affix the official seal of a guaranteed firm, and pay a deposit of 20 yuan in legal tender for registration and certificate filling. Otherwise, the old certificate will be canceled and cannot be exchanged. This announcement is made to avoid any misunderstanding.

### Japanese and Puppet Regimes Compile North China Exchange; Still Trying to Conceal It; Pretentiously Claiming "Chinese Customs Autonomy"

According to the French-language "Peking News," the spokesman of the "Provisional Government" here recently made a statement to reporters at a press briefing, saying that some days ago, news came from the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France had successively lodged representations with the Japanese government regarding the control of foreign exchange in North China. According to the spokesman's statement, this control of foreign exchange was the natural result of the autonomy of the "Chinese Customs" and was deliberately "distorted" by the imperialists of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, who raised "unconscious" protests. According to the spokesman, the exchange control measures implemented in North China treat Chinese and foreigners equally, and Japanese and "Manchukuo" people are also treated in the same way. Therefore, foreign nationals do not need to protest this and increase resentment. It was reported at the time that a foreign reporter asked whether the Japanese and "Manchukuo" people, even if they were treated equally, the Japanese and puppet sides could not use this as an excuse to compile measures that hinder foreign trade, since the principle of the Open Door was previously agreed upon by various countries and the Manchu Qing government. The spokesman appeared quite embarrassed by this question. He then said that this exchange control measure was really an economic need in North China, and that the Chinese National Government also had foreign exchange control, so why did other countries not protest against it?

Special Approval for Four Ships to Sail to Dinghai

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Shanghai-Ningbo sailing schedule scheduled by the Ningbo Shipping Association has been implemented since April 1st. As for the "Hana" of the German Far East Company, it has been approved to sail the Ningbo-Dinghai-Shanghai route, but it is absolutely not allowed to carry passengers when sailing from Ningbo to Dinghai and from Dinghai to Shanghai. Furthermore, the "Gaodeng" of the German Lulin Foreign Company has been approved to sail the Ningbo-Dinghai-Xiangshan route, the "Tianbao" of the German Far East Company has been approved to sail the Ningbo-Dinghai-Shenjiamen route, and the "Libao" of the Portuguese Zhengde Company has been approved to sail the Ningbo-Dinghai-Jianwanshiqing. "Tianbao," "Libao," and "Gaodeng" are each allowed to enter and exit twice a day, with the companies scheduling their voyages according to the regulation of two entries and exits each day. The number of ships to and from Ningbo Port is not fixed, and two entries and exits are allowed each day. If there are goods to and from Ningbo Port, merchants hire cargo ships to transport them. The oil tankers "Heguang," "Haiguang," "Dianguang," "Fuguang," "Shuguang," "Yaguang," "Yiguang," "Meinan," "Damao," and "Manlinson," and the cargo ships "Ende Kangshayi," "Maler," "Ninghai," "Nanning," "Yingzhou," "Liangzhou," "Niuzhuang," "Fusheng," "Minhe," and "Tongwu," total 11 ships.

Ningbo Defense Department Adds Regulations

The Ningbo Defense Department added the following regulations for scheduling voyages: (1) This table of allocations is in accordance with the temporary measures for navigation promulgated by order of the Headquarters of the 10th Army Group on January 19th and the regulations on ship navigation restrictions promulgated by the Zhejiang Provincial Government on February 15th, and is based on the history of the voyages of the registered ships in the Yongjiang River.

(5) When the "Haifu" sails from Taiwan to Shanghai, it is allowed to dock at Shipu and Dinghai to load and transport fish for export, but it shall comply with the various regulations on the transport of fish. (6) If any of the ships registered with this headquarters voluntarily abandon the voyages specified in this table, they are allowed to submit a request to the department for record before May 1st of this year. If they still do not sail in accordance with the specified routes by June 1st of this year, they will be dealt with in accordance with Article 12 of the Provisional Measures for Ship Registration in the Ningbo Area formulated by this headquarters, but cargo ships are exempted from the restrictions of this article. (7) The dates of entry and exit of each ship in the Yongjiang River shall be allocated and scheduled by the Yinxian Shipping Association in accordance with the provisions of the table on the right.

"Hana" Encountered Wind En Route to Shanghai

The "Hana" of the German Far East Company loaded passengers and cargo in Ningbo at 7:00 AM the day before yesterday and sailed straight back to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 PM that night, when sailing to the Tongsha waters outside the Wusong Estuary, it suddenly encountered a strong wind and surging waves. Several deck boards of the ship's No. 4 hold were blown away by the strong wind, and the electrical wires of the ship's radio station were also broken by the wind. The German captain of the ship was extremely alert and immediately stopped anchoring to avoid danger and sent out a distress signal. Fortunately, the wind subsided slightly, and the ship safely arrived in port yesterday morning after anchoring for a night.

"De Ping" Was Not Fired Upon by Japanese Warships

Yesterday's report stated that the "De Ping" of the Italian Sino-Italian Company sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai on the 31st of last month. At 9:00 PM that night, when passing through the Yushan waters, it was suddenly fired upon five or six times by Japanese warships stationed at Yushan due to heavy fog and poor visibility, causing the passengers to be frightened. A reporter from the Modern News Agency inquired with the company yesterday, and they stated that the news was completely untrue. The ship did not hear the Japanese warships firing at all during its voyage from Ningbo to Shanghai. The ship's crew also stated that there was no such incident.

### Japanese Consulate Police Authorities Not Moving into Post Office Parcel Department; The Parcel Department of the Post Office on Yuhang Road in Hongkou is a Separate Rented Space Unrelated to the Post Office

Reports state that the Japanese Consulate Police Authorities have moved into the Post Office parcel department to conduct business. This news has attracted much attention. A reporter from the Datong News Agency specially investigated and recorded the truth of the matter as follows:

The History of the Parcel Department in Hongkou

According to investigations by a Datong News Agency reporter, the Shanghai Postal Administration currently has two parcel departments: one is the General Post Office parcel department at the Sichuan Road bridgehead, and the other is the parcel department of the Hongkou East Yuhang Road Post Office Branch. It is understood that the Yuhang Road Branch parcel department was newly established after the Shanghai war, entirely for the convenience of residents in the Hongkou area for delivering and receiving parcels. Its name is the Yuhang Road Branch Parcel Business Office.

The Truth About the Japanese Police Station Moving In

The parcel business office was previously located within the Yuhang Road Post Office. Later, due to insufficient space, it rented the ground floor of the Public Works Department's primary school at 170 Peng Road for office use. A few days ago, the Japanese Consulate Police Authorities also rented the entire first, second, and third floors of the same primary school from the Public Works Department for office use. However, it is completely unrelated to the ground floor Post Office parcel department. It is incomprehensible why the Japanese side is deliberately misrepresenting the situation.

Seven Post Offices Reopened in Guerrilla Areas

Furthermore, according to Datong News Agency investigations, the Shanghai Postal District has recently reopened seven post offices, including: 1. Jinshan Second Class Post Office (reopened February 27); 2. Zhujiajiao Second Class Post Office (reopened March 20); 3. Qingpu Second Class Post Office (reopened March 25); 4. Luodian Third Class Post Office (reopened March 21); 5. Qibao Agency (reopened March 6); 6. Meilong Agency (reopened March 16); 7. Shaolou Agency (reopened March 6).

### Japanese Warships and Pirates Disturbing Dinghai, Eastern Zhejiang; Gaoting Town Suffers Losses of One Million Yuan; Liheng Island Pillaged, Villagers Flee

Gaoting Town and Liheng Island in Dinghai County, Eastern Zhejiang, have recently been repeatedly disturbed by Japanese warships and pirates, resulting in significant losses. The county government has ordered the strengthening of self-defense organization and training. The following are the detailed reports from the Modern News Agency's Dinghai correspondent:

Significant Losses in Gaoting Town

Gaoting Town, under the jurisdiction of Dinghai County, is located on the eastern frontier of Daishan, situated by the sea. Markets and residences are densely packed, and commerce is prosperous. Recently, for the past ten months, it has been repeatedly subjected to landings by pirates and shelling by enemy ships, with total losses reaching one million yuan. As a result, various sectors have experienced unemployment and displacement, and local autonomy and self-defense have been unable to proceed. The town mayor, Huang Jun, and local gentry and merchants, in order to stabilize the people's hearts and restore the town's appearance, specially telegraphed the county government the other day, earnestly requesting prompt rescue measures or sound policies to ensure the people's livelihood. Upon receiving the report, the county government, in addition to requesting the Offshore Maritime Police to suppress the pirates and defend the area, has also ordered the intensification of self-defense training to enhance self-defense capabilities.

Pirates Disturb Liheng Island

Liheng Island in Dinghai is remotely located in a corner of the sea, far from the city, and its local self-defense forces are extremely weak. In recent years, it has often been subjected to pirate landings and pillaging. On the 26th of last month, more than one hundred pirates suddenly arrived on the island, occupying the Taiping Temple area, forcibly seizing firearms from the self-defense team, and looting everywhere. The families of villagers Wang Gongzhu, Wang Huichang, Yu Baoren, Zhang Chenzhong, Wang Mengjiu, Wang Jinshan, Wang Menglai, and others were all looted, and they colluded with Taiwanese bandits to kidnap twelve children of Yang Jinhao's family in the Dasha Tou area, ten miles away, coercing local gentry and Baojia leaders to forcibly collect 16,000 national currency, and threatening to burn the entire village if all self-defense firearms were not handed over within a week. Currently, villagers have fled, with nine out of ten houses empty.

Public Works Department Health Committee Member Dr. Berezowski Resigns

Dr. Berezowski, a famous local physician, has served as a member of the Public Works Department Health Committee since 1930, serving diligently and sparing no effort for nine years, benefiting society in no small measure. Now, due to retirement, he has resigned. While accepting his resignation, the bureau expressed deep regret.

### The Dingshun Pawnshop in Nanhui Was Robbed; The Owner Sues for Compensation; Court Arguments Conclude, Judgment Scheduled

The Dingshun Pawnshop outside Nanhui County, after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, initially intended to relocate due to its importance to the economy of ordinary people, but was prevented by military and political authorities. After the National Army moved westward, it was again prevented from relocating by guerrillas, and continued to open as usual to maintain the market. On January 20th, 22nd, and 23rd of last year, it was robbed three times in a row. Afterwards, it reported to the local county government and moved the remaining pawned items to Shanghai. It is now advertising the redemption of these items at 105 Xiaodongmen Street, French Concession. Guan Jiangshi, a resident of Nanhui living in Room 114 of the Tong'an Building on Sanma Road, age 25, represented by lawyer Zhu Yakui, has filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court Criminal Division, accusing Chen Xiquan, the manager of the Nanhui Dingshun Pawnshop, of embezzling items pawned by others in the course of his business, requesting investigation, and adding a civil suit.

Seeking Return of Pawned Items

The lawsuit states that on January 3, 1938, the plaintiff, needing funds, pawned four items, including a gold riding heart needle, gold ring, gold band, and gold hair press, weighing a total of 1.6 taels, to the defendant Dingshun Pawnshop for 75 yuan, holding pawn ticket No. 52. On February 23 of this year, the plaintiff prepared the principal and interest to redeem the items. The defendant claimed that the items had been stolen and refused redemption. The defendant's pawn ticket stated that the pawn was valid for 18 months, and that damage from insects, rats, or mold would be subject to fate. The defendant only claiming theft is not credible. The plaintiff requests investigation and return of the original items. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court, represented by Judge Liao Yuan, summoned the defendant Chen Xiquan to the Second Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. The defendant Chen Xiquan, due to illness, sent lawyer Xue Jiaqi to defend him. The plaintiff and her representative lawyer appeared in court. After stating the previous circumstances, the defendant's lawyer argued that the defendant's Dingshun Pawnshop, located outside Nanhui City, was robbed three times in January of last year.

Robbed Three Times

Afterwards, the pawnshop reported to the county government and requested the Pawn Industry Association to send three people to jointly inspect the stolen pawned items, totaling 240 items, and prepare a detailed list for reporting. At the same time, the remaining items were moved to Shanghai and advertised for redemption, with a copy of the detailed list and newspaper presented for review. The plaintiff's pawned items were among those stolen. According to the Jiangsu Pawn Industry Improvement Plan implemented on January 1, 1935, Article 19 of the Provincial Government Council's announcement states that no compensation will be given for pawned goods damaged by war, floods, or fires. Moreover, the defendant's pawnshop is located in Nanhui. According to the agreement, the plaintiff's lawsuit in your court is also inconsistent with jurisdiction and should be rejected by the court after careful consideration. The court, after reviewing the statements, announced the conclusion and scheduled the judgment for 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th.

### Entrusted to Collect Disaster Relief Funds; Embezzlement Leads to Arrest; Seven Checks Cashed; Two Thousand Embezzled from the Middle

Xu Zichang, a native of Wuxi residing at No. 10, Pi Zi Lane, Taide Li, Xinzha Road, is engaged in the silkworm cocoon business. Several years ago, Zhu Boqin, of a certain silk factory, purchased silkworm cocoons from Xu and paid with seven checks totaling 9,333.5 taels of silver. However, when the checks

Failed to Clear

Xu negotiated with Zhu, but to no avail. Later, Zhu Boqin died of illness, and the matter was indefinitely delayed. Recently, Xu Zichang learned that Zhu Boqin's son, Zhu Mengqiao, had opened the Zhonghua Automobile Materials Company on Jing'an Temple Road, and the business was thriving. Xu wanted to recover the old debt, so he entrusted Hua Yunqing (age 52), a fellow villager residing at No. 25, Lane 253, Parker Road,

To Recover the Debt on His Behalf

At that time, Xu and Hua agreed that the minimum amount to be handled should be 3,000 yuan. Xu then gave Hua the seven checks, and Hua issued a receipt. Hua then negotiated with Zhu. By the 7th of last month, Hua went to Xu's house and said that the matter had been resolved, but the other party only agreed to pay 1,200 yuan. Xu did not object at the time, but was suspicious. After receiving the money, he gave Hua 400 yuan as a reward.

As a Reward

On the 25th, Xu sent a letter to Zhu to inquire. According to Zhu's reply, 3,200 yuan had been paid, and Xu realized that Hua had embezzled 2,000 yuan. Xu then hired lawyer Wan Weijian and reported to the Xinzha Police Station yesterday. Detective Chen Dabao and Western Detective Hua Sheng were dispatched to arrest Hua Yunqing and bring him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, Hua was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, saying that the defendant had

Admitted to Embezzling

2,000 yuan in the police station. Except for 1,000 yuan that had been spent, the remaining 1,000 yuan had been given to Miss Lu, a compradore at the Dalu Foreign Firm, Room 401, Guohua Bank Building, Beijing Road. The police station learned that the defendant had reached a settlement with the plaintiff regarding the civil lawsuit, but the police station would still prosecute the criminal part according to Article 336 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive, saying that a certain Mr. Yu Yang was involved in the matter. The judge ordered Hua to be detained and scheduled another hearing for the 14th of this month.

### Silk Industry Bank Offers Preferential Children's Savings

Free Deposit for the First Month

The savings department of the East Shanghai Silk Industry Bank on Hankou Road, Fujian Road, has specially formulated preferential children's savings measures to commemorate Children's Day, serving society and promoting children's savings.

### "Adoptive Grandfather" Repeatedly Extorts; Daughter Steals Money to Help Outsiders; Li Zhiming Sentenced to One Year and Two Months; Yao Keming Flees to Hongkou, Awaiting Arrest and Further Interrogation

Li Chusan, a native of Guangdong, has been deceased for many years. He had a considerable fortune during his lifetime, which was originally kept by his stepmother, Zhao. His family used to live in a self-built house on Jiangwan Power Plant Road. After August 13th, Jiangwan was in the war zone, so the family led their children to Shanghai to escape the chaos, renting a house at 1060 Avenue Edward VII. As the war situation shifted, their house was

Destroyed by Shellfire, Causing Great Losses. Unexpectedly, last month, it was discovered that all the property stored in the residence, including deposit books from the Shanghai Bank worth over 28,000 yuan, an insurance policy from the Tianyi Insurance Company for the Jiangwan property, 650 shares of the Public Omnibus Company, and various ornaments, had been stolen by their daughter, Li Zhiming, who colluded with Yao Keming, the adoptive grandfather of her young son, Li Songjiang.

Stolen, Sold, or Fraudulently Claimed. The old woman, accompanied by her young son, Songjiang, reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest her daughter, Li Zhiming, and bring her to the First Special District Local Court for questioning. The details were reported previously. However, the suspect Yao Keming has been hiding in the Hongkou area, making it impossible to arrest him. It is said that a separate

Warrant has been Issued. Yesterday morning, the police again escorted Li to the court. Judge Meng briefly questioned her, and, as the case had been thoroughly investigated, he immediately announced the verdict, sentencing Li Zhiming to one year and two months of imprisonment. The defendant's mother and brother also hired lawyers, originally planning to file an incidental civil lawsuit against her daughter to recover all the embezzled property, worth over 55,300 yuan. However, the defendant repeatedly

Confessed in Court that she had given all the property to Yao Keming, and she had not received any share of it. The plaintiffs, mother and son, were also aware that the defendant was penniless and that pursuing a lawsuit would be of no practical benefit. Therefore, they postponed the incidental civil lawsuit and will request it to be filed and prosecuted when Yao is arrested in the future.

Fire on Wuding Road Claims the Life of a Child

A fire broke out in a household surnamed So-and-so at No. 72, Lane 31, Wuding Road, McTaggart Road, in western Shanghai at around 10:35 AM yesterday. The fire quickly spread to the neighboring houses at Nos. 74, 76, and 78. Although the Fire Brigade dispatched vehicles to the scene to rescue, the wind aided the fire, and it was not extinguished until noon. A five-year-old child living in the same house was unable to escape and perished in the fire, his head and face charred, in extreme misery. A man named Wu Jiantang (age 42) was burned on his head and arms, and an old woman named Hu Sunshi (age 63) broke her left leg, in serious condition. They were taken to Renji Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The fire destroyed Nos. 72 and 74, which were completely reduced to ashes. The other Nos. 76 and 78 were also partially burned, resulting in significant losses. The police are investigating the cause of the fire.

A Degenerate of the Intellectual Class; Fraud and Embezzlement; The Appeal Maintains the Original Principle

Xie Xiangsheng, a native of Changshu, once served as a primary school teacher. After the outbreak of the war, feeling unemployed and bored, he established a disguised fraudulent organization called the Personnel Trust Office at 233 Yuanmingyuan Road last year, publishing flamboyant advertisements. Someone soon informed the police station, and after investigation, the police initially did not explicitly ban it. However, in February, Xie embezzled all of the more than 500 yuan in guarantee money deposited by the five employees he hired, Shao Zihong, Yu Fengxiang, Chen Wen, Jin Zhiying, and Cao Huizhong. After Shao and others reported him, the police station dispatched detectives to arrest him and bring him to the First Special District Local Court, where he was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Xie was dissatisfied with the sentence and filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu opened a collegial panel and ordered the defendant to be brought to court to question the reasons for his dissatisfaction. Xie's statements were all empty words and cunning defenses. Therefore, police lawyer Gan Jingxian requested that the appeal be rejected. As a result, Xie was still detained to await the verdict.

### Notorious Robber Sentenced to Death; Another Robber Sentenced to Five Years

Liu Shaokui, the Chief Chinese Inspector of the Public Security Bureau, along with Inspector Feng Zhiming, and Sergeant Yang Xiguang, previously arrested two notorious robbers, Shan Zhongzhi and Liu Baotian, in a shed at No. 290, Little Xizang Road, seizing a Lotus hand gun and six bullets. It was found that Shan and others had broken into Pan Caisha's property at No. 1189, Little Xizang Road, to rob him on the night of February 26th of last year. Also, on the night of the 19th of the same month, they opened fire during a robbery at No. 32, Lane 1170, Edinburgh Road, killing the victims Zhang Chuyuan and Zhang Wenda. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi sued them for robbery and murder in the First Special Court, and the trial has concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the First Criminal Court and announced the main text of the judgment: Shan Zhongzhi is guilty of robbery and intentional homicide, sentenced to death, and deprived of political rights for life. He is also guilty of robbery with three or more people carrying weapons, sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, and deprived of political rights for seven years. The death sentence will be executed, and political rights will be deprived for life. Liu Shitian is guilty of repeated robbery with three or more people, sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and deprived of political rights for five years. The hand gun and six bullets are confiscated.

Disaster Relief Worker Dies by Suicide

Gao Jixun, a native of Shandong, age 35, was the assistant bookkeeper at the Hengsheng Yi Summer Cloth Shop, a Shandong-based shop located at No. 22, Changgeng Li, east of Jiangxi Road intersection on Avenue Edward VII in the British Concession. Due to the embezzlement of funds that could not be made up, he committed suicide. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, he went alone to the Da Hu Hotel in the Dongxin Bridge area of Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, using the alias Wang Jihua, claiming to rent Room 216 on the second floor for lodging. That night, he took poison and committed suicide. At 11:00 AM the next day, the tea servant Yuan Zilin (age 26, native of Changzhou) discovered him and notified the shop, which reported to the French police. Detectives rushed to the scene to investigate. No suicide note was found, only a wallet and business cards. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital, but due to the severe poisoning, the rescue was ineffective, and he died at 4:00 PM. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Autopsy Center. Detectives checked the address on the business cards, and the deceased's colleague and manager, Ren Yanfu, arrived at the center to identify the body and sign for it.

### Japanese and Korean Thugs Dance Madly Late at Night, Refuse to Pay the Bill, and Fire Warning Shots; Police Suspect They Are Robbers and Give Chase Without Success

At around 11:00 PM the night before last, five Japanese men in suits suddenly arrived at a dance hall on Avenue Foch. They were accompanied by five dancers from the dance hall, Zhang Meiling, Zhu Lili, Peng Meiqi, and Zhang Meizhen. The Japanese men then ordered various refreshments and drank eight bottles of beer. They lingered until around 1:00 AM yesterday before getting up to leave. The waiter presented them with the bill, totaling 30 yuan and five cents, as well as a considerable amount for the dancers' fees. Unexpectedly, these five Japanese men refused to pay, and after a long negotiation, only agreed to pay 13 yuan and three cents. Because of the large difference, a dispute arose, and these five Japanese men

Strutted Downstairs, Ignoring the Matter. They also pulled out a pistol to demonstrate. The dance hall urgently telegraphed the police station to report. After the five Japanese men went downstairs, they fired several shots at the entrance. At that time, passersby did not know the truth and shouted "Robbery!" The manager of the Russian-language Chila newspaper across from the dance hall, hearing the news, also suspected it was a robbery and rushed out the door. He fired three shots into the air with his own pistol to demonstrate. The Japanese men quickly jumped into the No. 7882 car that had been arranged at the entrance and sped away. The No. 85 policeman on duty at the intersection of Avenue Mollière and Avenue Foch heard the alarm and immediately rushed over. Because the car had already left, he quickly jumped into the No. 12148 business car of Tailai Company on the side of the road and instructed the driver to chase quickly. A refugee from Austria also

Saw Injustice and Joined the Chase, Blaring the siren all the way. As a result, when the Japanese men's car passed the Rue de la Sainte Vierge in the French Concession, the No. 95 Chinese police officer there suspected a kidnapping and opened fire, ordering them to stop. Unexpectedly, the Japanese men's car sped eastward and disappeared. Afterwards, the dance hall authorities reported to the police station. The English-language North-China Daily News said that today (the 3rd) at dawn, a group of Koreans or Japanese, driving a car, were chased by a rented car, fleeing along Avenue Foch and Avenue Edward VII. There were also

Several Gunshots and Shouts of "Robbery". The incident arose from failure to pay a bill in a tavern. Police in the Public Concession and the French Concession are investigating this matter this morning and have requested the assistance of the police authorities of the Japanese Consulate. The clue obtained by the police is the number of the car, which is registered to a Korean. The incident started before midnight when five Koreans or Japanese, or both, went to a cafe on Avenue Foch to dance several times, drinking a lot of alcohol. At about 1:00 AM, the five decided to leave the store, and the waiter handed over the bill. They not only refused to pay the bill, but also

Assaulted the Waiter. Then they rushed to the door. The Chinese security guard tried to stop them without success. The five also tried to seize the security guard's pistol. They then got into their car and drove eastward wildly. The customers and staff in the tavern shouted "Robbery!" Mr. Qi Liejin, the general manager and editor of the Russian newspaper living nearby, heard the shouts and fired two shots from the balcony of his residence to attract the attention of the police. A Chinese police officer heard the shouts and rushed to a rental car of Tailai Company parked near the tavern. With the help of a foreigner, believed to be an Austrian refugee, the Chinese police officer requisitioned the

Car to Give Chase. It is said that the five men fired shots while fleeing to try to prevent the Chinese police officer from chasing them. A Chinese police officer of the French Concession at the corner of Avenue Messimy also fired two shots, one of which hit the rental car chasing behind, but the people in the car were not injured. Although the Koreans or Japanese were chased, they still managed to escape. Minutes later, detectives from both concessions began investigating.

### Morphine King's Gang Busted in Two Locations

Two major centers for the sale of narcotics run by morphine king Zhou A'gou and Ming Fuyuan, located in the Yihong Hospital Yao Er Tang Zi Lane on New Bridge Street in the French Concession and in the New Bridge area, have been ordered to be investigated by the French police authorities. However, such cunning rabbits' dens are not easy to break. However, the French police, including Chinese and Western detectives, recently busted members of their gang. One was in the attic of the second floor of No. 14, Dexing Li, West New Bridge Street, at the home of a woman named Cao A'lin (age 30, native of Pudong), where 11 small packages of morphine were seized. Cao and her accomplice, Chen Jinrong (age 29, native of Shaoxing), were arrested and taken back to the police station. Another arrest was made on Zilaihuo Street, where Zhou Wenyu was found to be carrying five packages of morphine. He was taken back to the police station and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District yesterday, requesting detention for investigation and arrest of the fugitive masterminds. After questioning by Judge Zhang Minsheng, the judge ordered a retrial on the 7th and ordered the defendants to be detained.

According to him, he told police officers that he wanted to go to Honolulu. The boy is still being detained at the police station, and the American authorities here will take care of him.

### Southwest Mail All Forwarded Via Hong Kong

Packages to Kunming and other places have not yet resumed delivery

The Shanghai Postal Administration previously stipulated that all mail sent from Shanghai to the southwest or forwarded to the northwest provinces and cities such as Sichuan, Shaanxi, Xi'an, Gansu, Hubei, Yichang, Hunan, etc., should be forwarded via Wenzhou and Ningbo in Zhejiang, and transported by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which was quite smooth. However, due to Nanchang falling into the war zone, traffic on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Xiang-Gui Railways has been obstructed. Although the authorities have opened up alternative roads to maintain the original state, the transportation of mail is still difficult. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with the Transportation Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday and learned that all mail and packages, large and small, for the southwestern provinces and cities will be sent to Hong Kong by ship, or forwarded by Haiphong. The route includes (1) Nanchang and all places south of Nanchang, (2) Sichuan sent to Haiphong, forwarded by Yunnan, (3) Shaanxi and west of Xi'an, west of Gansu, (4) Yichang in Hubei Province and west of it, (5) Hunan sent to Hong Kong, forwarded by Shantou. Therefore, the delivery time is longer than before. In addition, regarding all kinds of large and small packages to Kunming, Yunnan, and along the Dian-Yue Railway, it was originally planned to resume acceptance and delivery this week. However, the Haiphong Post Office sent a telegram stating that the amount of packages accumulated there is like a mountain, please suspend acceptance and delivery.

### Japanese Soldiers Stab Laborer

Zhao Hongsheng from Sizhou, 28 years old, residing at 242 Park Road, used to be a painter but is now unemployed and destitute. Every morning at 7 o'clock, he waits at the Chapoo Road Bridge, sometimes when the Japanese in Hongkou need many laborers, they instruct a foreman (from Jiangbei), Mr. A, to call over several people to cross the bridge to work. They are escorted back across the bridge at dusk around 6 or 7 pm, and then they go home. Zhao can only temporarily make a living in this situation. Yesterday morning around 7 o'clock, Zhao went there as usual. Soon, a Japanese person raised his right hand (meaning he only needed five people). However, there were too many unemployed people south of the bridge, about a hundred or so, crowding forward. He was stabbed by the Japanese sentry stationed north of the bridge with a bayonet. Zhao was the first to be hit, stabbed once, and his right arm was pierced, bleeding profusely. He quickly returned across the bridge, and the Central Police Station at No. 1110 called for an ambulance to take him to Tung Jen Hospital for treatment.

Chen Jilin, who works at the German Merchant Shipping Company and resides at No. 75, Xiangcheng Lane, No. 93 Rue Bai Eer in the French Concession, was suddenly invaded by five robbers at 7 pm on the 29th of last month. The robbers, armed with two pistols, stole two diamond rings and over 200 yuan in cash. The robbers escaped with the loot. The victim chased after them and caught one of the robbers, Pan Jinhua (29 years old, local). He was taken to the police station, where he confessed that his accomplices were hiding in the New World Hotel at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Jing'an Temple Road. The police went to the New World Hotel and arrested Wang Jingen (27 years old) from Pudong. He was taken back to the police station and was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer for the French Concession administration, requested a postponement of the investigation and prosecution, and to arrest the remaining accomplices. The victim also described the robbery and the process of catching the first defendant. Pan confessed that he and the fugitives Pan Liangwen and others had come to Shanghai from Pudong with a Mauser pistol to commit robbery, and now they have returned to Pudong. Wang denied being at the scene. Judge Zhang Minsheng ordered a postponement for further questioning on the 12th and ordered the defendants to be detained.

### Japanese Arrest Passengers on Chongming Boat - Chongming Guerrillas Active, Japanese Suffer Heavy Losses - "Informants" Falsely Accuse Civilians and Lead to Arrests

The Pudong Southern District Branch of the Japanese Special Service Agency, together with the Japanese Military Police Detachment of the Floating Hotel, arrested two men and one woman passengers on a Chongming boat in the Suzhou Creek the day before yesterday. Following this, they arrested a man on a Chongming sailboat in the Yangshupu area, totaling three men and one woman. All are currently detained in the Southern District Branch Detention Center on Dongchang Road. Qiao Ben, the director of the Southern District, secretly interrogated them under severe torture. All were ordinary civilians and gave no confessions. It has now been learned that the truth of this case is that the Chinese guerrillas on Chongming Island outside Songkou are very active, controlling most of the land. The Japanese have suffered heavy losses and have been unable to "eliminate" them. They have therefore recruited dozens of local bandits and assigned them to the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanghai as informants to investigate the movements of the guerrillas between Chongming and Shanghai. These people originally relied on robbery and kidnapping for a living. After being severely suppressed by the guerrillas, they had no place to stand and surrendered to the Japanese, using the opportunity to lead arrests of guerrillas to gain merit and vent their anger. However, the guerrillas are too numerous, and the bandits do not know the members. It is not easy to identify and arrest them. Therefore, since March, they have had no success. Fearing that the Japanese would doubt them, they falsely accused civilians of being guerrillas the day before yesterday and led the Japanese to arrest them for no reason. These four people had more than a thousand yuan in legal tender, two gold watches, and two gold rings, which were all confiscated. Their lives are also in danger. This shows the wickedness and cruelty of the bandit detectives in harming innocent people.

Children, what kind of place is Shanghai? Shanghai is a place where the spirit is most depressed and the spirit is most degenerate. If you want to promote the work of spiritual mobilization, then your own spirit should be quickly and greatly transformed: 1. Strictly abide by discipline: (1) wake up early and go to bed early; (2) study and work on time; (3) abide by national laws; (4) obey school rules and obey parents; (5) be polite to others; (6) eliminate all personal interests. 2. Prepare to sacrifice generously: (1) temper your body to prepare for expeditions; (2) save pocket money to donate to the country; (3) do not buy foreign goods and use Chinese goods; (4) collect all military supplies and contribute them to the government. 3. Economize practically: (1) cherish time; (2) cherish property; (3) strive for simplicity in life; (4) absolutely do not engage in actions that hinder the country or consume national strength. 4. Struggle heroically: (1) study and work every day with the vigor and spirit of the Eastern sun; (2) do not be lazy or perfunctory; (3) have the courage to do things and not be afraid of difficulties; (4) earnestly promote various movements to contribute to the country in spirit and material.

### Singapore Chinese Football Team Arrives in Hong Kong from the Philippines: Four Wins and One Loss in the Philippines; Two Unfortunate Losses in Hong Kong

(Hong Kong Dispatch) The Singapore Chinese Football Team, invited by the Philippines to compete, departed from Singapore on the 13th of this month. After arriving in the Philippines, they played five games from the 17th to the 26th, winning four and losing one, achieving satisfactory results. After the competition in the Philippines, they came to Hong Kong to schedule three major matches, all managed by the South China Athletic Association, as they were responsible for hosting the team. The team of 21 initially intended to arrive in Hong Kong on the 31st via the China Clipper seaplane, but because the flight was rescheduled to April 2nd, they changed to the "Flying Hotel" Boeing Clipper California yesterday morning at 7:30. It arrived at Kai Tak Airport sea surface at 12:30 noon. Those who came to welcome them included Mo Qing, Zhang Wendong, Li Huitang, and many Chinese and Western reporters.

Original leader Shen Guantou was temporarily unable to travel with the team due to business matters. Deng Yuehan was promoted to leader and coach. Secretary Cao Qiulin, Captain Xu Houkun, and Vice-Captain Ji Youling, the list of the team is as follows:

Leader and Coach: Deng Yuehan

Secretary: Cao Qiulin

Captain: Xu Houkun

Vice-Captain: Ji Youling

Players: Li Botang, Feng Huiwen, Chen Jiawan, Ye Maofa, Sun Chunlai, Ye Dade, Li Yiyou, Zhu Chenggui, Cai Yuehan, Wu Gushi, Xia Zhixiang, Xie Qingfu, Wen Guanzong, Long Liewu, Li Haizhu, He Guocai, Guan Xinde

Excellent Cooperation

All staff and players stayed in Room 305 of the Sens Hotel. According to Captain Xu, in the five games in the Philippines, it was possible to win all the games, but the third game was lost due to several players being injured. It is understood that the Philippine League Championship was won by the YCO team this year (the captain and left inside forward of the Philippine team who came to Hong Kong for the intercity match a month ago, Bausili, and the left winger Biji, are the pillars of the team). The Singapore Chinese team met this team in the fourth game in the Philippines and defeated them by three to one. In the fifth game, they met the all-Philippine team and also won by two to zero. Based on this, it proves that the Singapore Chinese team is very strong.

The team excels in short passing tactics and has excellent cooperation skills (any football team that excels in short passing must have excellent cooperation skills). All players are energetic and excellent in heading the ball, so they won the Singapore League Championship for two consecutive years, which is not accidental. When they set off, they were exhausted, but they won two goals against the Philippine elites. It can be seen that their skills are superb.

Results in the Philippines

17th Evening: Won against the All-Philippine B Team, Five to Two

### The Meaning of Life

— Mao Lie

No matter who it is, seeing a lively child, no one does not feel the meaning of life. Even the most stubborn and desolate old man will increase some interest in life because of it. Then Children's Day can simply be regarded as the festival of life, and we should celebrate it once a year.

Children's Day is set on April 4th, one or two days before Qingming Festival, which can indeed best express the meaning of life. Because at that time, the severe winter has completely passed, all things are revived, and they are beginning to flourish. We originally regarded this time as a good day and festival in the year, and now with Children's Day, it complements each other.

In the West, there is also Easter at this time. Its function does contain religious colors, but in terms of the operation of nature, this is originally the time for all things to return to spring, then resurrection can be used as the rebirth of all things. Rebirth is returning to youth, and children are the rebirth of the elderly, which also increases the meaning of Children's Day.

If we regard the Yellow Flower Festival on March 29th as a symbol of death, then this Children's Day on April 4th can be regarded as a symbol of life. Going from death to life, it is fine to regard Children's Day as our spiritual Easter.

These are all talking about the usual Children's Day, but on this Children's Day during the War of Resistance, the meaning is felt to be even deeper.

Children are future adults. In this great era, we have many things and endless responsibilities that we want them to take on, so we must cultivate them well and make them reproduce endlessly, exceeding everything we have. "Ten years of gathering, ten years of teaching," we should act accordingly to achieve the wish of "annexing Wu."

The Republic of China has been revived from an ancient country of thousands of years. This revival project is only at the starting point, like a child, only at the most naive age. Now, suddenly encountering adversity is like the tender buds on a tree encountering frost and snow. We must cherish her with the heart of cherishing children, so that she can take root and become a great country.

Therefore, on Children's Day, we must realize the meaning of life, especially the meaning of the life of the country and nation.

In addition, everyone has a desire to live, but everyone also has a prohibition against harming life. Harming the lives of others to seek one's own life is a scourge to mankind and must be severely punished, even removing them from humanity. Now, there are such scourges who do not hinder their lives, but come to harm our lives. For our own lives, we can only fight to the end and eliminate them!

This is my final understanding of life. I hope we all unite and work hard!

### The Wilderness

— Zhang Zhenshan

Rushing down the hillside, braving a gust of bleak cold air. I thought, it's already early spring, why is the wilderness still frozen, without a hint of green? Grim and desolate, a gust of wind blows through the grass on the graves, even emitting a terrifying, piercing sound.

I stopped, gazing at the desolate graves: the scattered, withered weeds, the decaying thorns, interwoven into a yellow carpet, spread out before me; the tombstones lie there, a scene of barren coldness and stillness, no one to mourn, no poet to sing its praises.

"Right here! Take the desolate graves as our stronghold, the coffins as our gun racks, we can face the highway ahead."

Old Qiang, who spoke these words, immediately swung his mud shovel, easily digging a hole two feet in diameter as if digging a steamed bun. He squeezed his body into it, waiting silently, gripping the machine gun and glaring out through a small hole! After we flattened the dug-up soil and weeds, we quickly hurried through the thicket.

This area was considered "swept" clear, and the smell of gunpowder in the air seemed to have disappeared. The Japanese devils were so pleased, wriggling like a long snake on the winding highway, those scattered black figures, like wild dogs searching for food; Old Qiang, lying in ambush in the desolate grave, watched until his eyes were burning with fire, but he had no choice but to endure, holding his breath, letting time quietly pass. From early morning to noon, and then to dusk, he hid like a silkworm lying in its cocoon, so concealed, remembering the captain's instructions: --The Japanese devils think this area has been "swept" clear, wait until their guard is down, estimate when we can annihilate a sufficient number, then strike!

The scattered figures of the Japanese devils stirred his anger, countless times, ultimately suppressed by replaying the instructions; continuing to wait, to watch, to estimate, delaying for dozens of hours.

Time was approaching dusk on the second day.

In the silent twilight, a clamor came from the highway, three Japanese devils with handlebar mustaches and gold-rimmed glasses, rode up on tall horses, their command sabers flashing with brilliant silver light, smug and arrogant, followed by a large group. The motorcycles bumped along the highway, looking very heavy, probably loaded with ammunition?

At this moment, Old Qiang thought to himself and smiled; the fire of anger burned again, violently and swiftly, through his whole body; he gripped the machine gun: --Rat-tat-tat… a burst of fierce strafing.

The men with handlebar mustaches and wire-rimmed glasses, immediately fell off their horses, collapsing one after another, blood splattering everywhere. The Japanese devils behind, those who weren’t dead, were all stunned in fright, frantically firing in all directions, the sky crisscrossed, forming a net of fire, enveloping the empty wilderness.

The Japanese devils were probably wondering? Was this the human world, or a dream? Staring, they saw only the silent, deathly forest and desolate graves in the wilderness, with no one there.

As they ran to surround the forest, Old Qiang laughed until his stomach hurt, and he lay down to eat dry rations.

After a burst of running, Old Qiang fired another burst, under the net of fire, no one knew how many Japanese devils had fallen.

The night gradually deepened, the empty-handed Japanese devils were still terrified, anxious, and angry; they relied on their sophisticated equipment to unleash its destructive power: --Boom… thump… thud…. The mountain guns shook the entire wilderness, flames spread across the dry weeds; Old Qiang's blood also boiled, but he more calmly stroked the machine gun handle: Rat-tat-tat… and then he laughed again.

### The Future Great Tree

— Ci Kai

### Before Sunrise

— Ding Di

Who has ever sailed in a small boat, drifting on a black sea, through the long dark night, a tiny life gripped tight in the waves, rising and falling, chasing the tide, full of terror, sorrow and hope, and finally, while praying for light, saw a red sun rise on the horizon, slowly ascending, gradually the whole universe became warm, isn't this joy no less than the joy of rebirth?

It is the joy of light, you say, is it not also the pleasure of rebirth?

Rain makes people feel dull, fog makes people foolish, and night makes people irritable, who has ever suffered from insomnia? Even if it's for a month or two, a night or two, tossing and turning in bed, the mind entangled in a myriad of thoughts. Who can bear it? No sun, no light, no heat, not to mention no warmth or joy. Trapped in the heavy siege of the night, people are often lonely, without companions, without similar voices, perhaps you cry out because of frightening phantoms, but afterward you may even find that you were mute and silent.

At this time, is there anything more lovely than the sound of a rooster? Before you have even glimpsed the faint dawn, the clever harbinger has already announced it to you. No need to worry about no light, no heat, no joy, no warmth. It is often a happy message, the tall treetops, daubed with a light layer of rouge, the vast distant sky, revealing a layer of hazy fish-belly white, the sea, so blurred and ever-changing, reflecting the golden waves like fish scales.

Perhaps you have been trapped in nightmares, entangled in them, plunged into dangerous situations, awkward situations, situations of crying, when you are distressed, in danger, or even when you are crying, suddenly a ray of dawn shines on your face through the window lattices, containing infinite warmth. In half-doubt and half-belief, you hear the sound of a rooster crowing, finally, you resolutely push away the dream. At this time, you see the rebirth of light, how can you not be joyful?

However, please think, why were you not swallowed up by the darkness? You can see the light again, you are happy, but why are you happy?

Are there not many people crawling in the dark, panting, and silently collapsing? They crawl from the darkness toward the light, like climbing a tower, gazing at the spire, at the sunlight, some sighing that they have no strength to climb, willing to squat in the darkness; some impatiently stop climbing, they fall, staggering, into every corner. Some people are the most unfortunate, they have endured the whole night, battling the darkness countless times, unfortunately disappointed, at the end of the night, when the last drops of time run out, just as they are about to see the top of the tower. They are swallowed up by the darkness, with no chance to see the sun again.

The long night makes people pessimistic, and moreover, there are many nightmares, we fear the night, fear the darkness, and even more fear the dark dreams, therefore, we look forward to the sun, the sun gives us laughter and warmth.

Although it is only a weak light, it is the source of light. After a long night of fighting, not being swallowed up by the darkness, we have heard the sound of a rooster crowing again, this is the first sound of human joy.

The rooster has crowed. But the dawn has not yet fully broken, some people hide in the darkness, shouting about the darkness. The time before sunrise is the most agonizing, because the night is so long, longer than midnight, longer than the first watch. Although there is sunlight, there is still darkness.

Moreover, before sunrise, there are still many people swallowed up by the darkness.

Only those who constantly seek light can grasp the morning sun, step forward to meet it, and watch those clowns disappear one by one in the sunlight.

The rooster has crowed. But the dawn has not yet fully broken. Before sunrise, you need patience!

### A Message to My Son

— Gu Gong

(Aishima Takeo's "A Message to the Young," will move every "grown-up" who reads it. I hope this "Message to My Son" will resonate with every father.)

Today is Children's Day, and you are all very happy. Unfortunately, I, your father, have been unemployed due to the war and have no gifts to give you. I can only say a few words to you, which will serve as my way of celebrating this day with you. You are all good children, and you are willing to listen to me, right?

Of course, you are still very young now. Ah Da is only nine years old, and Ah Er is only seven. But Ah Da is already in the third grade of elementary school, and Ah Er is in the second grade. Usually, listening to you speak, I can tell that you also have a strong sense of national and ethnic identity, and you know how to hate our enemies with gritted teeth. This makes me very happy. Then what I want to say to you, you will understand, and my words will not be in vain.

I say to you, first, when you grow up, you don't need to be particularly filial to me. At most, treat me as a fellow citizen, and I will be satisfied. Because I have raised you entirely for the sake of the country, for the sake of the entire nation. When you grow up and are willing to do your best for the country and the nation, that is being filial to me, and you are already, unknowingly, being filial to me now. You call me "good daddy"; you are affectionate with me; you love me. When I am happy and see you, I am even happier. When I am unhappy and see you, I turn sorrow into joy. You give me much joy and comfort. You make me energetic in my work, because I think I am fighting for you, I have a purpose. You make my daily life meaningful, because I have to raise you up... All in all, you have already repaid me greatly in invisible ways, which is being filial to me, and I am already very satisfied. When you grow up, you will have greater responsibilities. I don't want to monopolize you, and I don't want to hinder your great future in the slightest. That is why I don't want you to be particularly filial to me again. Good children, you must keep my words in your hearts and put them into practice when you grow up.

Your "good daddy" has your "good grandmother" and "great grandmother" above him, and yourselves below him -- your "good mother" is capable of living independently --, so he cannot fully serve the country and the nation, and he has always regretted this in his heart. If you grow up and dedicate yourselves completely to the country and the nation, fulfilling his duties, you will truly be filial sons. You must be such filial sons.

You have promised me, and I am truly happy. Then, second, I want to tell you what I hope you will do.

I am an impatient person, I don't like beating around the bush, and I always like things to be straightforward and quick. So when you grow up, if your physique passes the test, I hope you will both join the Air Force. Ah Da is more stable, so perhaps he can pilot a bomber, and Ah Er is more nimble, so perhaps he can pilot a fighter plane. In the event that your physique doesn't pass the test, then you should join the artillery corps and become artillerymen. In modern warfare, airplanes and cannons are important weapons, and we must eliminate our enemies, so I hope so. To go one step further, if you cannot join the artillery corps, then you can join any kind of army. In short, when you grow up you must save the country and save the nation; to save the country and save the nation, you must become soldiers.

If -- and I really don't want to say this -- you are like me, and you have not been in good health since childhood, and your eyesight is also poor, making you unsuitable for being soldiers, then what I hope for you is to study national defense engineering or national defense chemistry. In the future, our "Maginot Line," or the invention and manufacture of any poison gas, will have your contribution. Ordinary engineering or chemistry, or other practical subjects, can certainly also save the country and the nation, and I would not disapprove of you studying them if you like. But I say again, I am an impatient person, and when the situation is critical, I feel even more that I cannot wait. I always hope that you will engage in military work most effectively.

Finally, I tell you, I least want you to be like your "good daddy," who only knows a few words, can move his pen, is never full or warm in his life, and can at most be a basic, law-abiding citizen, who is not of much help to the country and the nation. Now, seeing the enemy rampaging everywhere like a beast, although his heart is bursting with anger, he cannot personally kill them and drive them away. Your "good daddy" died long ago when his "good daddy" died, so he had no one to guide him, and the burden of the family was heavy, so that his temples are gradually frosting, and he has accomplished nothing. Now you have him to guide you, to relieve you of your internal worries, this is your good fortune, and you should make it your life's career to defeat the enemy and prevent them from entering the country!

Remember well, Ah Da and Ah Er, my sons: I want you to become soldiers! If you cannot become soldiers, then engage in occupations related to national defense! By all means, do not do what I have done! Do not worry about me! In this way, you will be filial sons! You can rest assured that your "mother" agrees with me!

My sons, I am truly happy: your little fists are raised, you have listened to my words. Really, the enemy is bullying us like this, if we do not avenge this hatred, can we still be considered human beings! My sons, grow up quickly!

### Finance: European Situation Slightly Eases, Spot Price Rises After Falling, Hong Kong Exchange Rate Tightens: Foreign Banks Return to Absorb

Yesterday's spot gold price on the black market suddenly stopped falling and turned to rise. This was because the situation in Europe had slightly eased, the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to weaken, a certain foreign bank returned to absorb, and a certain money exchange also stopped selling and started buying. Therefore, the morale of all parties changed from fatigue to stability, and they were close to the 2070 yuan mark. However, it had once slightly fallen in the middle due to the selling of gold houses, but ultimately, the supply could not meet the demand, and it was difficult to maintain for a long time. As a result, it rose 9 yuan, with flat trading, about 550 taels. Jewelry gold also returned to a high of 1 yuan. Customs gold was stable, and Sino-British pure gold, etc. all slightly fell.

Spot Gold Rose 9 Yuan Yesterday

Since early morning, each bar (ten taels) initially had scarce supply and demand, so there was no trading for a long time. Until 9:50, because a certain bank suddenly bought on behalf of a foreign firm, trading was seen, and the market was quite stable under the buying of foreign firms and spot gold houses. First, a certain bank bought 50 taels each from a jewelry shop and a gold house, at the opening price of 2063 yuan, which was 3 yuan higher than the weekend. Afterwards, a certain spot gold house also bought a total of 100 taels from a jewelry shop at the same price. Following this, a certain money exchange bought 50 taels from a gold house at the price of 64 yuan. Later, a certain bank also bought 50 taels from a gold house at the price of 63 yuan. A certain money exchange bought 50 taels from a jewelry shop at the price of 65 yuan, and another money exchange bought 50 taels from a gold house at the price of 66 yuan. After this, because jewelry shops and gold houses took advantage of the high price to sell, it slightly fell. A jewelry shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange at the price of 65 yuan, and a gold house sold 50 taels to a money exchange at the price of 62 yuan. It was already 11:40. After this, the buying intention of the buyers was strong again, but the sellers had stopped selling and were watching, so no trading was seen. The closing price at noon was still 62 yuan. In the afternoon, because the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to weaken, the buying trend was stronger, but the sellers were still watching. Therefore, in the thin trading, it rose 5 yuan at the opening, first with a gold house trading 50 taels with another gold house at the price of 67 yuan. Later, at 3:30, another jewelry shop traded 50 taels with another jewelry shop, at the closing price of 2069 yuan. As a result, it rose 9 yuan compared to the weekend, with a daily difference of 7 yuan. The selling price of spot gold houses was 2075 yuan, and the buying price was 2065 yuan. The current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was no trading.

Jewelry Gold Increased by 1 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael was not changed at first. But at 2:40, because the spot gold price showed a firm trend, it also increased by 1 yuan. Da Tong Hang changed to 210 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang was 208 yuan, with a buying price of 202 yuan.

The Decline in Customs Pure Gold was Very Slight

The Central Bank's Chinese cash purchase price has dropped to 1212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed Customs gold price remained flat, calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 3 jiao, calculated at 1207 yuan and 6 jiao. This was due to the fact that the London price of British pure gold on April 1 fell by half a pence per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence.

### Foreign Exchange Still Lacking Change, Tianjin Gang Once Dumped Hong Kong Exchange Rate Buying Enthusiasm Revived

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was dominated by oil companies, Mobil, and other foreign firms, who came to settle their accounts, but foreign banks such as HSBC still had a strong intention to supply, and the Tianjin gang once dumped. Therefore, the supply and demand were balanced, and the price remained stable. As a result, there was still no clear winner or loser, and the trading was slightly active. After Reuters reported the news of the Hong Kong dollar being about to depreciate last Friday, speculators in the city tended to come out, so the price was quite loose amidst a chorus of selling. However, the buying enthusiasm soon revived, so it weakened again.

At the beginning of the morning, London's large amounts of near-term and long-term contracts continued to increase by 0.0625, the New York silver price remained flat, and the London spot gold price fell by half a pence. The exchange rates of the British pound against the US dollar, the French franc, and the Shanghai yuan were unchanged. The US dollar against the British pound, the French franc, and the Shanghai yuan also did not rise or fall, but rose by 3 fen against the Shanghai yuan. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening selling price in the morning was 8 pence and 25 for the British pound, and 16 yuan and 0625 for the US dollar, which were both flat compared to the weekend. After opening, foreign firms took advantage of the opportunity to sell on behalf of the Tianjin gang, so the market was more stable. A profitable firm sold British pounds to Hua Yi for 8 pence and 25. HSBC announced that the listed price would not change, and the silver balance tax was announced to be just over half a point, calculated at slightly 5.00%. After this, although major foreign firms successively settled their accounts, the intention of British and American banks to supply was quite strong, so it remained quite stable. Foreign firms settled their accounts with HSBC, Holland, and Mecca British pounds for 8 pence and 25. Shuangyou settled with a certain Dutch bank US dollars for 16 yuan and 0625. Near noon, Chinese firms, East Asia, and Guangdong gangs all competed to buy Hong Kong exchange rate, so the potential trend tightened. However, the Chinese merchant yarn and flower gang suddenly dumped, so it slightly hardened, calculated as Chinese firm East Asia Guangdong gang absorbed Chinese merchant yarn and flower gang and money exchange Hong Kong exchange rate 55 yuan and 875, weakened to 625, and then hardened back to 75. By the noon closing, the bank's selling price for both British and American exchanges was the same as the morning opening.

In the afternoon, profitable firms first bought British pounds for 8 pence and 25, followed by the oil company Mobil settling with a certain Dutch bank US dollars for 16 yuan and 0625, so the process remained without much change. Afterwards, foreign firms, Anda, Overseas Chinese, and East Asia absorbed Hong Kong exchange rate from money exchanges, from 55 yuan and 75, weakened to 625, the situation continued to tighten. By the late closing, the bank's selling price was 8 pence and 25 for the British pound, and 16 yuan and 0625 for the US dollar. As a result, compared to the Saturday noon closing, both British and American exchanges had no gain or loss, while the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to weaken by 25.

Suddenly, gold houses and jewelry businesses took advantage of the high price to sell, and the market price returned to weakness. In the afternoon, the Hong Kong gang of money exchanges bought in large quantities, and the supply from retail gold houses, etc. was not strong, and the market price rose again. After the closing, they still wanted to buy in, and the sellers were scarce. The daily rise and fall was sudden and unpredictable.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Firm and Stable, Affected by Soaring Yarn Prices

Securities in the gray market showed a slight turnaround in trend yesterday. This was due to the international situation appearing somewhat more moderate, coupled with a wavering atmosphere of peace beginning to sprout. There were also signs that the exchange was actively preparing to resume operations, and rumors of new international loans to China being established. Although these various reports lack concrete evidence, they are not entirely without cause. Therefore, the cloud of market depression seemed to gradually clear, and those who had shorted the market began to hesitate. The bullish side gained the upper hand on the trading floor, showing signs of continued rise. Throughout yesterday, both "Tiansheng" and No. 35, which had been sold off for many days, saw buying interest. No. 7 also experienced considerable absorption. Although No. 38 saw some selling of Class C shares, and De Fu Feng Da also made slight moves, it was apparent that the supply of shares was insufficient to meet demand. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread about a sharp increase in cotton yarn prices, leading to large purchases by the yarn and cloth merchants. Class C and E shares broke through major levels once again. Runli and No. 35 saw the most enthusiastic buying, and Hongda also had strong demand. Retail investors also absorbed shares vigorously in small quantities. Tongkang and Nos. 41 and 42 saw some unloading. The trading floor became increasingly tight, and a rising trend gradually emerged. The prospects for further gains are quite possible. As a result, prices rose by 4 to 5.5 jiao. The total trading volume was estimated to be around 700,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing　Compared to Previous Day

Unified Class A　5760——5760　Up 0.50

Unified Class B　5170　5140　5170　Up 0.40

Tram, 开平(Kaiping), Shanghai Banking Corporation and Reclamation shares showed renewed demand, but成交(transaction) was limited. The trend for rubber shares seemed more favorable to the bulls, but sellers asked for higher prices, and成交(transaction) volume was very low.

### Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong and Shantou Actively Operating, Spot Yarn Prices Rise Sharply, Double Horse Jin Cheng Jumps Eight or Nine Yuan, Japanese Yarn Shows Signs of a Short Squeeze

After falling for many days, yarn prices rebounded sharply yesterday, with a significant surge. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn had been declining sharply from 386 yuan due to the abandonment of orders by Yu Chang, reaching a low of 365 yuan on March 28, a difference of 21 yuan. This sharp drop led to demand from southern China, including Hong Kong, Yunnan, and Chaozhou. Today, the Guangbang Wanxing company purchased 500 to 600 bales of 20-count Tiannv Double Horse yarn on behalf of the Hong Kong and Shantou merchants. Market floating shares were snapped up, causing market sentiment to shake and buying to surge. The market price jumped 3 yuan. Subsequently, many bulls in the same industry, who had been accumulating for a long time, viewed the changing environment and made every effort to buy in the market, pushing prices up higher, resulting in an even stronger upward trend. Generally speaking, a rebound was possible due to deep declines and strong real demand. However, after such intense price increases, yarn sales will be affected again. Market conditions continued to rise in the afternoon, and there was even more active trading among peers. Market sentiment was unusually excited. The现出(current price) of 20-count Double Horse has already reached 383 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan compared to the previous day.

Regarding the current yarn situation, at the beginning of the morning market, the Hong Kong merchants were very active, opening the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn up 3 yuan to 378 yuan. The Guangbang purchased 40 bales on behalf, but still had an appetite. Market conditions suddenly improved, and buying became stronger. The trading floor suddenly became tight, and the market price became more expensive, jumping beyond the 80 yuan mark. The highest price was 382 yuan, with a slight pullback of 1 or 2 yuan in the middle. In the afternoon, some peers, based on the development of spot sales, pulled in even more strongly. The market trend was extremely sharp, rising another 2 yuan. It was found that the total amount bought by various merchants throughout the day was 3,330 bales. The prices of 20-count Double Horse rose by 8 yuan, Tiannv rose by 7 yuan and a half, Tejincheng rose by 9 yuan, and Muyang rose by 6 yuan. The factory opened 300 bales of 10-count Baoyi from the Hongzhang factory at a price of 294 yuan. The Chongxin factory opened 100 bales of 20-count Dafa at a price of 368 yuan. The Xinyu factory opened 130 bales of 10-count Double Earth at a price of 295 yuan. The Anda factory opened 200 bales of 10-count Flying Tiger at a price of 290 yuan to 291 yuan. The Yongan factory opened 120 bales of 20-count Tejincheng at a price of 395 yuan. The quantities bought by various merchants are listed below:

Hong Kong　710　Peers　1,210

Yunnan　140　Inland　180

Shantou　770　Fuzhou　60

Tianjin　250　Quanzhou　10

Total 3,330 bales

The Japanese yarn market continues to move forward, and the rising trend is fierce. According to the market, there are too many short positions, and there are signs of a squeeze. However, actual sales are only smooth in North China, while other aspects are still normal. The spot price of 20-count Shuiyue yarn is 348 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 339 yuan, an increase of 3 to 4 yuan compared to the weekend.

### Coarse Velvet Raw Materials Are Especially Popular, Yao Clothing Rises Another Yuan, Brazilian Cotton Shipped in July and August Has Been Ordered

The local cotton business is unusually deserted, and factory demand is very sluggish. In reality, the selling price is high, and the source is dry. Moreover, local stocks are becoming increasingly fragile, thus forming an awkward situation. It's in a state of near suspension. As for Indian cotton, the exchange price is indeed low, but the quality is inferior, making factory work very difficult. Judging from this situation, manufacturers are currently in a difficult situation. However, coarse velvet cotton raw materials are especially popular. Factories have active sales of 10-count yarn, so Yao clothing has risen another yuan. Other market conditions remain calm. The source of Subei is still not thin. Yesterday and today, 1,562 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, and 4,650 pieces were transported from Ningbo yesterday. The current cotton situation is recorded below:

Foreign cotton market price: The European situation is deteriorating, securities are falling continuously, and the New York cotton market is therefore quite weak. Washington has not yet made progress on the issue of loan cotton. It is reported that members of parliament will convene a meeting today to continue discussing the cotton industry. Yesterday, New York continued to fall by 5 to 6 pounds due to mass selling. India fell one rupee, including forecasts, and Egypt fell ten pounds. Yesterday's exchange rate did not fluctuate much. Converted into legal currency, cotton prices rose and fell. American cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 4 jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by 3 jiao and a half, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than one yuan.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Yesterday turned quiet again, not becoming lively due to the rise in yarn prices. This is because factories are waiting for the US government to resolve the loan cotton issue. In recent days, Brazilian cotton transactions have been particularly active, already reaching shipments for July and August. The shipping route from South America to China takes about two months, so Brazilian cotton ordered now will arrive in Shanghai in September and October. The calculated factory delivery prices for foreign cotton yesterday are listed below:

Raw Material　Category　Delivered to Factory Including Tax

60-count Egyptian cotton High grade　102.75

Also　Also　Medium grade　99.85

80-count　Also　High grade　127.80

Also　Also　Medium grade　117.60

### Piece Goods: Dongpi World, Wuhu Has Strong Demand, Unfortunately Most Are Not Domestic Goods, Autumn Goods Are Being Sold in Large Quantities, Japanese Factories Are Already Engaging in Hoarding

Due to the sharp rise in Eastern silk fabrics and fine twill in domestic cloth, dyed and finished piece goods, market sentiment has become very firm, and various factory products have increased prices, by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half per piece. Wholesale business in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong merchants and local street stores have improved. Large-scale purchases have also occurred in the ports of the guerrilla areas, Wuhu and Bengbu. It is said that various parts of Anhui are concentrating in Wuhu to purchase goods. Shipping cloth is very profitable, with a profit of 1 to 2 yuan per piece of goods worth 10 yuan. Domestic cloth accounts for only 10% to 20% of sales, and the export of local goods is subject to Japanese control, making remittances difficult. Therefore, guest merchants are greatly restricted in shipping goods. Guangdong merchants have added more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, poplin, fine cloth and fine twill. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants purchased more than 3,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached twill, bleached cloth and poplin. Ordered goods from various factories are reported to be shipped steadily. The quoted price of Dongpi's autumn fabric, broadcloth, has increased. Various Chinese factories have a strong demand for blanks for autumn clothing, line cloth and woolen cloth. Tens of thousands of pieces have been ordered for July and August shipments. The current sales of white goods show a slight turnaround. The local street office purchased more than 100 packages of Jardine Matheson coarse cloth, mostly at a higher weight. Dye factories purchased 70 to 80 packages of fine twill, and the price remains stable.

Due to the continued strong purchases by merchants in the northern route, the market sentiment for Dongbu fine cloth and fine twill is excited. The price of fine cloth has risen sharply by 2 jiao per piece, and the price of fine twill has risen by 1 jiao and 5 fen.成交(Transaction) by local merchants reached a huge amount of more than 2,000 pieces. It is said that Japanese factories have limited inventory and are now closed and not selling, so foreign firms have no goods to open. They are engaged in buying and hoarding to wait for a good price. Therefore, peers have tightened their goods and there is a tendency for continued increases.

1,400 pieces of export cloth were shipped to Tianjin on the 4th.

### Navy Blue Water-Repellent Woolen Fabric is Selling Well

Navy blue water-repellent woolen fabric is in high demand among Western-style tailors. It's also the reason for replacing the shortage of medium-thick broadcloth. Its water resistance is stronger than broadcloth and other woolen fabrics. Yesterday, British-made navy blue water-repellent woolen fabrics generally sold for more than 10 yuan. Shen-woven fabrics, with more domestic mainland products, wholesale for 5 yuan, 7 jiao and a half per yard, No. 1 for 6 yuan and 6 jiao, Jardine Matheson for 5 yuan and 5 jiao, Yongxing for 5 yuan, and Hongkang for 4 yuan and 6 jiao.

### Silk and Tea: The Future of Silk Prices Will Depend on the Shift in Foreign Sales

Yesterday's silk market was sluggish, with New York closed on Sunday and Yokohama closed due to a holiday. Therefore, the situation in this city is even more sluggish. Based on the current market conditions, observing the future trend of the silk market, the local silk price will shift from the support of domestic customers to the embrace of foreign sales for practical use. In other words, if recent silk sales continue to be sluggish, the silk price will continue to be sluggish after soaring and plummeting (currently, the silk price is calculated based on Class B 7/8 white factory, the highest price was 1,900 yuan, and now it is only 1,550 yuan, a drop of 350 yuan). It will inevitably become more and more tired and fall below the 1,500 yuan mark. On the contrary, if domestic and foreign raw silk this year can maintain 1,500-1,600 yuan due to the thin inventory of raw materials, it still seems possible.

Yesterday, the local silk market saw inquiries from American and British-French firms, but unfortunately the limited prices in the accounts were too harsh to be accepted by manufacturers. However, some transactions were made. White factory RR was 1,550 yuan, and French silk was 1,500 yuan, which is still under negotiation. Double palace silk was 1,040 yuan. Yesterday, there were continued deals. As for the user side, the general psychology is more bearish, and buyers have returned prices to 1,500 yuan.

### Food: Flour Mill Prices Have Been Unified, Restoring the Previous Price of 4 Yuan and 4 Jiao

Factory Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market conditions in this factory gradually became more expensive. Checking customer transactions, it was more active than before. It is said that the flour previously handled by the Hebei and Shandong merchants has been gradually shipped in recent days, so the new demand can be called continuous. However, since the factory has engaged in special price competition several times, it is unwilling to sell at a discount again. In the morning, a batch of warships was成交(transaction) at 4 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. In the afternoon, the North Ocean merchant price, car and ship brand has been uniformly restored to the previous price of 4 yuan and 4 jiao, the same price as the Nanyang merchants in this street. As a result, the factory price began to be unified. The total成交(transaction) volume of the unified market was nearly 100,000 bags, with the North Ocean merchants still accounting for the majority of sales, followed by the Nanyang merchants and the street merchants.

Foreign Flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market also tended to stabilize. In terms of sources, in addition to the whole batch waiting to arrive soon, there were still scattered small shipments arriving. It is said that the prices of American and Australian products have not changed much. Futures transactions still feel lacking. However, the current floating stock has been reduced in recent days, and the goods in the hands of large households are unwilling to sell at a discount due to cost considerations. Therefore, the market is gradually entering a stable track. High-end brands insist on the spot price of 4 yuan and 1 jiao in cash, and mid-range brands are also calling for 4 yuan and 1 jiao. However, according to people in the industry, a large batch of foreign flour will arrive soon, and the market may still have a period of confusion before it can gradually get on the right track.

Wheat: Yesterday and the day before, the source of local wheat slightly arrived, but they were all scattered small tickets, mostly directly distributed, and there was no formal market. It is said that the local wheat needed by Shanghai flour mills recently is directly purchased from the producing areas, so the goods supplied sporadically in the market have a very scattered intention, and the market has stopped again.

Foreign Wheat: Today, there is another arrival in Shanghai, which is the Baohe Foreign Firm Salvus previously reported by this newspaper, shipping wheat from Australia to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to be imported tomorrow. Yesterday, the firm received a telegram from the ship saying that it would arrive this morning, carrying a total of 7,990 tons of wheat, berthed at Yangshupu buoy numbers 35 and 36 for unloading. It is said that the Australian wheat was purchased by the Liji Foreign Firm on Sichuan Road. (祖)

### Superior Japonica Rice and 客秈(Ke Xian) Rice Sales Are Both Clear

Superior Japonica Rice: Yesterday, the various gangs arrived from Hebei at the 6th and 7th piers. The chariot wheel, baozi, Suzhou, Tongbang and Yixing gangs arrived with more than 2,000 packages. The sales market in this street is not small and is not handled. Hoarders are mostly watching, so although the sellers are trying their best to maintain prices, the effect is very small. Moreover, the成交(transaction) volume of each item is limited, and the market is soft. As a result, the price of thick and thin Japonica rice is a few cents to a jiao less. Du Yangjian, Bu Jianpingping, and Biangwu, which were asked about slightly yesterday, also saw prices stabilize.

客秈(Ke Xian) Rice: Yesterday's digestion was very light. The local merchant warehouses lacked appetite. Currently, the source of 客秈(Ke Xian) rice is arriving in succession. Most people are trending down, and floating merchants and scattered warehouses are especially trying to sell quickly. The market is sluggish and sales are slow. The unified market only opened nearly 1,000 packages of goods from the Big Market, all of which were goods of 12 yuan and 45 jiao, and the price continued to be 1 jiao less. The stock of foreign rice is scarce and lacking in arrivals, and the owners still insist on the original price.

### Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Rises Sharply and Falls Slightly, Futures Have a Hesitant Trend, Peanut Oil Speculation Moves Opportunistically

Soybean oil market conditions are in a brewing situation, with prices rising sharply and falling slightly. Because Da Yun was closed yesterday, the Japanese merchants in this city still have no statement on the issue of control, so futures are still difficult to resolve. The hearts of the people in the market are hesitant. Yesterday, there were still transactions being made on the trading floor, mostly profit-taking goods, with a total of 400 barrels of Da Yun oil成交(transaction) at a price of 37 yuan, down 5 jiao from Saturday. 60 pieces of Yanqi opened at a price of 26 yuan and 5 jiao, also down half a yuan.成交(Transaction) for 50 pieces of road goods delivered in three weeks at a price of 26 yuan and 5 jiao. Da You Yu factory oil was listed at the original price of 28 yuan and 8 jiao, which was not the actual成交(transaction) price.

Yesterday, 200 pieces of soybean oil were shipped from Yantai.

During the turmoil of the soybean oil control, speculators inside and outside the industry are on the move, causing the market to rise. Jiao oil continued to rise by 3 yuan, opening at 32 yuan and 31 yuan and 5 jiao,成交(transaction) for 150 pieces, and delivery in April was ordered at 100 pieces at a price of 31 yuan. 200 cans of Tianjin canned oil opened at 40 yuan, and 100 cans of Qingdao canned oil opened at a price of 42 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans Sell Weakly, The Impact Is Minimal

Although the yellow soybean market is subject to Dalian's export control, its potential is not affected by the weak sales market. The market price has only increased by a few cents. Yesterday, it was estimated that two cars of Dalian soybeans for delivery in April were opened at a price of 8 yuan, 4 jiao, 8 yuan and 3 jiao and 8 fen. The current soybean成交(transaction) was 4 cars at a price of 8 yuan, 6 jiao and 6 jiao and a half. Chongming sand yellow opened a total of more than 600 packages, and the price was also 8 yuan, 6 jiao and 6 jiao and a half. Delivery by the owner was priced at 8 yuan and 7 jiao. Pinghu Du soybeans are still at 10 yuan, with only 30 packages成交(transaction).

### North-South Goods: Qingdao Raw Peanuts, Once Again Stipulated Price Reduction

Since the restriction of prices for Qingdao raw peanuts, both the import and export sides have not exceeded the limit. According to a letter yesterday, it was also stipulated that the price should be reduced by another 4 jiao within the period from the 2nd to the 8th of this month, so the product price has returned to a looser state. Now the Southwest Port Ren is 12 yuan and 7 jiao, and the ordinary Shidao Ren is 12 yuan, 8 jiao and 9 jiao. 洋莊办(Foreign firms) handled more than 3,000 packages, large Ren is 13 yuan and 1 jiao, 400 packages. Only 1,500 packages of Wangtai peanuts were成交(transaction) at 10 yuan and 2 jiao.

### Sugar Market: Tai Che White Spot Goods Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the trend of foreign sugar continued to rise. The association set the price, and the price of 24 coarse white sugar in this warehouse was raised by 2 jiao to 25 yuan and 2 jiao. 200 to 300 packages of re-exported goods were continuously成交(transaction) at 17 yuan. Swire's car white B mark was also very firm. At first, 50余包 of West Wharf goods were 成交 at 25 yuan and 05 jiao, and later 1 jiao was shouted, and 50 packages of East Wharf goods were 成交 at 24 yuan and 9 jiao, CW mark 24 yuan and 8 jiao, CX mark 24 yuan and 7 jiao, DY mark 24 yuan and 5 jiao and a half, 2 jiao better than the 1st. The domestic sugar market still belongs to the Pingruan(gentle and soft), the成交(transaction) volume is also small, and the潮帮(Chao Merchants) 开出 (opened) 20 packages of Long Qing at 13 yuan, 45 packages of Huang Gang Qing at 14 yuan and a half, 40 packages of ordinary Zhi Chi at 14 yuan and 4 jiao, and 80 packages with higher ones at 14 yuan and 6 jiao and a half.

11,770 bags of sugar from He Lan came on the 2nd.

### Seafood: Raw Powder Continues to Arrive

Recently, 1,500 bags of Shuang T mark arrived with 生粉, which has been sold at a price of 14 yuan and 4 jiao, which is 4 jiao higher than the previous market. It is said that the rear cargo has already been dumped, and the price is 14 yuan and 7 jiao. 6,870 bags of 生粉 arrived from He Lan on the previous day (2nd).

### Paper: Foil Merchants are Good at Hoarding

Due to the unrest in eastern Zhejiang in the tin foil market, or perhaps because the source was blocked, market sentiment once rose, but there are still producers in this city who are stockpiling and releasing it, and the selling price has changed little. However, foil merchants calculated that the current cost must be a loss of 7%, and the digestion during the Qingming Festival is especially strong, and the selling price will be increased again that day.

### Coal: Coal Scraps Market Is Firm and Expensive

The coal scraps business is still not thin, so the market state is not only stable as usual, but also has a firm and expensive image. Yesterday, Kata scraps were priced at 41 yuan per ton, Songpu scraps at 37 yuan, Keelung scraps at 36 yuan, and Kaiping special scraps at 40 yuan, also lacking supply. The foreign branch also sells No. 2 scraps on its own, and the customer must also add a foreign fee to the 28 yuan.

### Imports and Exports: Import of Soap Raw Materials, Continuous Source of Fresh Eggs

On the 2nd, 41,740 packages of white wax (kerosene) from the Netherlands, 550 boxes of rubber, 550 pieces of tree bark, 4,700 pieces of coconut shells (soap raw materials) were imported.

On the 3rd, 32,750 pieces of wood were imported from Fuzhou, 3,000 pieces of fresh eggs from Tianjin, 2,700 pieces from Xingang, and 1,300 pieces from Ningbo.

### Where is Paradise?

— Tan Weihan

Children's Day is here.

I don’t know if the company is really planning for the children, or if they are thinking about their own business. They have already set up the so-called "Children's Paradise."

However, there are two conditions: (1) Clothes must be neat and tidy. (2) Admission by purchase invoice. This cannot but make the homeless, wandering children remain outside the Paradise: Unable to enter the Paradise, they have to钻(bore) into hell.

Here, I am reminded of the Paradise built for children in other countries.

On the New Continent, a priest named Flanagan (E.J.Flanagan) founded a children's city dedicated to educating homeless children, not only providing them with food and lodging, but also educating and shaping their personality. The purpose is to reduce the number of vagrants in society and increase the number of good citizens. Since Children's City was established to accommodate homeless children, there are no ethnic or religious restrictions, nor are they asked where they came from. But there are also two conditions: (1) The children are homeless. (2) As long as the city can accommodate them.

According to the founder: "The reason why I founded Children's City is because I believe that there is no such thing as a bad child in the world. Twenty-one years of experience have made me have no reason to change this idea." Yes, a child will never become a "bad guy" before he reaches adulthood. The problem lies in whether there is good guidance.

In the Children's City, he opened a letterpress printing office, a shoe repair shop, a carpentry workshop, a milk shed, a farm, and a dry cleaning field. Children who learn these careers will be able to support themselves without relying on the relief of charitable organizations when they leave the Children's City.

"When I know that one of my children has become better," Flanagan said, "I feel that the efforts I have put in for these homeless children and the work I have done to create them have not been in vain!" (Editor's note: The "Children's Paradise" which opened in Nanjing Grand Theater in October is a description of Father Flanagan's arduous history of building a children's city.)

Let's take a look at what the Soviet Children's City is like? Regarding this, 程國 君 recorded it in great detail in A Visit to the Soviet Children's City (see the Education Magazine, Volume 27, No. 3). The following are his words:

"No country has as complete facilities for children as the Soviet Children's City. The scope of the Children's City is very large, including places of various shapes and colors that meet the interests and needs of children. It is not only a place for recreation and entertainment, but is established in accordance with children's psychology and scientific principles. On that side, there are scientific research laboratories for studying electricity, aviation, and other land and water transportation equipment, a biological research institute that provides children with knowledge of animals and plants, a club that uses applied science toys to increase knowledge of history and geography, a playground equipped with various equipment, and a kindergarten to act as a guardian for mothers..."

Indeed, this is enough to make us envy, excited, and moved. However, our country, like other countries, recognizes that children are the masters of the future world; recognizes that good character and habits must be developed from an early age. But the facts tell us that most of the masters of this future world have now become the dregs of mankind; everywhere we can see the footprints, tears, and scars of wandering children—some say they are the flowers of happiness.

Children's Day is here. The company has set up a beautiful "Paradise" for children. Let me, very impolitely, represent this group of countless homeless children and ask:

"Where is our Paradise?"

### Education and Nurturing

— Zhou Lihua

### Shanghai's Children's Welfare Undertaking

— Yang Chunlu

——The Unfortunate Experiences of Children and the Glimmers of Hope for Their Welfare——

Originally, Shanghai's children could be said to be the happiest in the country; however, due to the impact of this "holy war," Shanghai's children can no longer be called happy. Children starving to death, freezing to death, and dying from illness are common sights. Suffering, homelessness, and wandering have become ordinary phenomena.

Recently, various circles in Shanghai have begun to pay some attention to the welfare of children. On Children's Day, everyone needs to know the current situation of children's welfare in Shanghai. Therefore, based on what is known, a brief overview is provided for reference. However, it is important for everyone to note that this does not mean that Shanghai's children have already entered a state of happiness. Of course, tragic facts still exist widely. However, even in this dismal fog, there is still a glimmer of light! It is hoped that everyone will muster the courage to move forward along this glimmer of light, so that in the near future, all children in Shanghai can universally step into the garden of happiness.

(1) Organizations Working for Children's Welfare

The Chinese Child Welfare Association

This association is organized by enthusiastic Chinese and foreign individuals concerned about child welfare issues. It was founded in 1928. The proclaimed purpose is "to promote, maintain, and protect the rights of Chinese children, and to seek happiness for children in every possible way." The current operations are divided into five groups: (1) Protection Group, protecting the rights of general children; (2) Relief Group, providing relief to helpless children; (3) Health Group, promoting children's health; (4) Research Group, promoting parental education and child training; (5) Propaganda Group, arousing public awareness of child welfare. (Editor's Note: See the previous month's issue of this publication for work details on the 27th.)

Shanghai Children's Welfare Association

This association was only established in mid-June last year. There are currently 35 directors, with Chen Heqin as the chairman of the board, and Chen Jicheng and Huang Dinghui as vice chairmen. Its organization is divided into four departments: (1) General Affairs Department, (2) Economic Department, (3) Affairs Department, (4) Editorial Department. The association's headquarters is located within Shanghai Women's University on Dagu Road.

The projects undertaken by the association include ten newsboy schools, educating more than 500 newsboys. Eleven more have now been added, bringing the total to twenty-one. They are currently preparing to establish a beggar children's training institute to house homeless children from the streets, which will open today. Following the beggar children's training institute, they will also organize a child labor rescue committee to improve the welfare of general child laborers. (Editor's Note: See the previous month's issue of this publication for work details on the 10th.)

(2) Children's Organization Research Group: Sixty-Six Children's Science Research Society

This society is organized by a group of children who love science and nature. It was established on June 6, 1935. The initial number of members was sixty-six, so it was named the Sixty-Six Children's Science Research Society. Their purpose is: "To satisfy children's desire for knowledge, to obtain the benefits of joint research, and to cultivate an interest in and habit of scientific research."

The society's organization is divided into three sections: books, research, and publication, with one president, one secretary, and one accountant. There are currently more than seventy members, all wearing a plum blossom-shaped "66" society badge. When joining the society, members must pay a joining fee of two dimes, and thereafter pay a regular fee of two dimes per person per semester. Any child who is interested in science and is between the ages of ten and sixteen can join.

Each semester, they convene all members for a general meeting to discuss the progress of society affairs. A research meeting is held once a month, sometimes stipulating a research center, or changing to a lecture, debate, field observation, experimental performance, essay contest, and other activities. A new issue of "Scientific Children" is published every Saturday, attached to the Children's Newspaper, as a forum for members to study each other and report their experiences.

New Children's Reading Club

The purpose of the association is: "To use spare time to study proper knowledge, to arouse interest in reading, to cultivate the habit of self-study, and to use this to connect feelings and promote love and sincerity." A general meeting of members is held once every two months, a meeting of association affairs is held once every half month, and an academic symposium is held once a week. The general meeting of members produces a president and vice president, and also establishes a secretariat, academic affairs department, membership department, supervision department, library, recreation, and publication positions to preside over all research matters.

### Viewing Ran Xi's Personal Watercolor Painting Exhibition

— Camel

Art is a product of the times, and art changes with the times. The times move forward constantly, and art also moves forward with the times. If an art form solidifies and does not follow the progress of the times, then it shows the weakness of the art, and even the danger of extinction. Mr. Gao Qifeng once said, "Painting is not a dead thing, but a living and changeable thing. Each era has its own spirit, characteristics, and experiences. A painter is not only seeking fame, nor is he only comforting himself. He should have the feeling that the hunger and drowning of the world are his own hunger and drowning, and have the concept of achieving oneself and others, and strive to sacrifice interests and clarify the new spirit of the Ming Dynasty." This also illustrates the inseparable relationship between art and the times.

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, China has had a new enlightenment movement in the cultural field. Because China's War of Resistance is not only resisting crazy invaders, but also building a new China and a new Chinese culture. Painting, as one of the cultural departments, certainly has an important task. Unfortunately, the Chinese painting world has not grasped this great era. This is so lonely and solitary, I lament the desolation of the Chinese painting scene. But in Shanghai this year, when the swallows returned, I saw the solo exhibition of watercolor painter Ran Xi, just like the sunshine in spring, giving my heart a warm nourishment.

This solo exhibition has a total of more than sixty works, displayed in the Sino-French Friendship Association at the intersection of Route Massenet. All are refined works. Watercolor painters have a common problem: either their technique is too unskilled, or they lack emotion. Ran Xi's paintings do not have this problem. His technique has reached a refined state, and his expressiveness is rapid and passionate; passion is the life of an artist. If an artist has no passion, not only will the picture present a gray scene, but the impact on society will also be a gray life. But every one of Ran Xi's paintings is full of vitality and vigor. The red tones bathe in the fresh sunshine, writing about those pedestrians, streets, trees, and houses, and making them come alive and rich at an accelerated pace, as if being in the countryside in spring. This kind of vibrant work symbolizes the new China, and the new China also needs this kind of thriving art.

Ran Xi's watercolor paintings like to use a strong contrast in composition. For example, the sky is left very high, and the houses and ground are painted very small. Thus, in that high sky, one can see some rapidly moving clouds, and the brushstrokes are very smooth and vigorous. The appropriate coordination of light is especially a characteristic of Ran Xi's paintings.

A successful artist relies on talent and effort. Ran Xi has considerable talent and I hope he continues to work hard.

In the past, when sending express letters at the post office, there were many categories within express mail. There were ordinary express, special express, air express, and many other distinctions. Of course, air express was the fastest. Air express was airmail express, but it was limited to a few major cities in the country that could be reached by air, and the fees were also very expensive. As for non-air express mail, it was often very slow, not much different from ordinary mail. As soon as there was an obstruction, especially fast became especially slow. This cannot be blamed on the postal authorities, as they were also helpless. But now it is different. All express mail is delivered by plane. There is no need to use the name air express, and it is all sent by air. There are several reasons for this: first, domestic airlines are well-connected. Not to mention domestic ones, which international airline company is not connected to China, whether in Europe or America? Second, the Chinese post office itself has several air routes, and its own special planes dedicated to sending express mail, which have recently been expanding. Third, personnel matters are complicated, and time is increasingly sought after for economy. Without a quick method, it is impossible. Now that there is a quick method, why would they still stick to the old method? For example, those who are used to taking cars and trains are still willing to take the former oxcarts and mule carts? Because there are more and more airplanes for aviation, of course there are also more and more airports. Airports are everywhere throughout China. But places like Anle Town and other market towns do not have airports. Presumably, the post office has an aviation network. Whichever bureau is closest to which airport will send it to that airport. There are also some places where it is not necessary to stop the plane, but there are quite a few letters. They have prepared a kind of letter parachute, put the letters into the parachute, and throw it off the plane. There are also people waiting there below, catching the letter parachute and delivering them separately. In short, for the sake of convenience of letters, there are new and wonderful methods that are difficult to describe. With the method of aviation delivery of letters, it has truly achieved morning departure and evening arrival. Just like an express letter sent from Anle Town to Beiping, handed over to the post office overnight, it can arrive in Beiping tomorrow afternoon. This letter is probably still from Anle Town to Shanghai, and Shanghai flies directly to Beiping. However, according to the time distribution, the time from Anle Town to Shanghai is more than double the time from Shanghai to Beiping. There is also the transfer from small airplanes to large airplanes. Similar to large airships going abroad that want to fly over the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, carrying hundreds of passengers and transporting tons of cargo. Therefore, in order to seek its speed, the small airports in each city will carry passengers to the large airports and attach to large airships, just like in the past, small steamboats were used to transport passengers to large ships in front of the Bund.

### Speaking of the Importance of Marital Love From Children's Day

Intelligent Children are the Crystallization of Love

Children are truly living treasures. They are the continuers of their parents' lives, the inheritors of the family, the future pillars of society, and the future masters of the nation. Their responsibilities are so great, and their future is so bright. So it is no wonder that parents call their children, the crystallization of their love, "baby" and "treasure."

Today is Children's Memorial Day, April 4th. Schools are closed for vacation, and companies and businesses are offering special discounts on children's goods or opening up children's playgrounds to entertain children. Various organizations and groups are holding memorial meetings, lectures, and recreational activities. In short, today the entire world is enthusiastically celebrating this Children's Day. This is so solemn and meaningful! However, on this Children's Day, we offer sincere advice to young couples in general: that children must be the crystallization of marital love. This is because, according to eugenics and medical judgment, a energetic and healthy man and a beautiful woman will certainly have intense love, organize a happy family with joy and happiness, and give birth to intelligent children. These children, the crystallization of love, will certainly be intelligent, lively, healthy, and beautiful, truly a living treasure like a little angel. At the same time, because of the connection of this crystallization of love between the couple, their love will certainly be particularly strong, and their marital life will certainly be fulfilling and happy. This is such happiness! However, if a man has committed self-indulgence and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been dissolute and indulgent after marriage, resulting in weakened innate functions, breaking out with spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, thin sperm and infertility, incomplete development, neurasthenia, and other symptoms, then the couple's life will not be satisfactory, or even completely unable to perform the marital act. Then the couple's relationship is nominal, their love is weak, their youthful happiness is lost, and the children they give birth to are mostly weak and sickly, with a particularly high mortality rate, or even unable to conceive, leaving a lifelong regret!

According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the only remedy for the above symptoms is to take the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhisu," which is the most effective and symptomatic. It can produce sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish nerves in one day and night after taking it. Once taken, it can completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and can achieve the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating youth, and reversing aging. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Ximitoushi Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that the effect is even faster. It is true that with a healthy body, on this Children's Day, I wish you both greater love and early birth of good children.

Beauty and Health

### Breasts and Spring Outings

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Spring is truly the season for women to be active. Although it has been raining and windy these past few days, and the weather seems a bit cold, precisely because it has been a bit cold, once the weather clears up, the myriad flowers in the park bloom in competition, making the spring even more vibrant! At this time, many women on spring outings are wearing thin spring clothes, revealing snow-lotus-like pink arms and willow-like slender waists. They are even matched with a pair of towering and attractive breasts, fluttering gracefully in front of their chests. Their cheeks are filled with charming smiles, and they are with affectionate companions, either standing beside the pavilion, watching pairs of butterflies, whispering sweet nothings, or leaning against the waterside pavilion, listening to the chirping of birds, singing a soft song. Their faces are as delicate as peach blossoms, their singing is as crisp as the sound of orioles, leaning on each other, their feelings are intertwined. What a wonderful and happy picture that is!

But women who have lost their beauty and health are not blessed to participate in such a beautiful and happy picture. Think about it, can a woman who has lost her beauty and health still have towering breasts? Can her arms still be plump? Can her complexion still be as delicate as peach blossoms? It is undoubtedly impossible! Because it is impossible for them, they only have sallow faces, flat breasts, and thin arms. Even if they wear new clothes, they cannot hide their ugliness. Such women are not only disliked by others, and no one takes their arms and whispers sweet nothings with them in the park, but even when they look at themselves in the mirror, they feel endless regret! But what's the use of regret? If you understand the cause of the loss of beauty and health, and actively take the ovarian preparation "Shengzhisu" for women, then there is still time. This preparation is finely formulated, whether you are suffering from irregular menstruation, postpartum weakness, leukorrhea, dysmenorrhea, or failure to recuperate after illness, it can cure them for you one by one in the shortest possible time. If you continue to take it, it can not only make your breasts tower high, but also make you younger and more youthful. It can make your cheeks rosy, and increase your beauty.

### Untreated Spermatorrhea is Enough to Shorten One's Life

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Dreams, these two words are so poetic! But dreams during the spring love arousal period are lurking with danger. When sweet dreams linger in the "land of sweet sleep," some are awakened by laughter, because they feel the illusion of the dream and recall the sweetness of the dream, which leads to masturbation. Furthermore, masturbation becomes a habit, resulting in loss of sperm control, followed by nocturnal emission. It is also common for the lingering of dreams to cause sexual stimulation and suddenly cause nocturnal emission. In short, dreams during the spring love arousal period are more bad than good.

Once a young man has masturbation and nocturnal emission, he should realize it, purify his heart, reduce his desires, repent of his past mistakes, and if the nocturnal emission does not stop, he should seek medical advice and take medicine as soon as possible for diagnosis and treatment. Do not ignore it. If you do not take it seriously and allow the symptoms to worsen, you will end up with exhausted sperm and blood, resulting in kidney deficiency and incompetence, local shortness, scattered energy, prolonged infertility, neurasthenia, and other symptoms. Then you will be trapped in pain all day long, not only will there be no hope for academic and career prospects! Even in the marital life that is indispensable in life, it will not be possible to coordinate emotions and live a fulfilling life, and your wife will hate you, and all kinds of tragedies will be staged in the family! At the same time, in the man himself, because of the pain and sorrow, he will age prematurely or even die young!

The most effective treatment for nocturnal emission at this time is to take "Ximitoushi Sperm-Consolidating Tablets," which can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, reduce dreams, and ensure peaceful sleep all night long. Nocturnal emission can be completely eradicated. If the above symptoms have already been caused by nocturnal emission, you must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhisu" to increase sperm and blood, nourish the brain and kidneys, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it, you can completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and can achieve the benefits of prolonging life, rejuvenating youth, and reversing aging.

### Remedies for Leukorrhea and Infertility

No Worries About Infertility

Because leukorrhea causes patients to lose their ability to reproduce, gonorrhea accounts for the highest rate in infertility statistics. Among these gonorrhea-related infertility cases, epididymitis accounts for the majority. Therefore, gonorrhea patients are most afraid of epididymitis. Examining the structure of the epididymis, it contains about twenty tubules that are integrated. Their function is to transport the sperm that has been produced in the testicles. Unfortunately, if epididymitis occurs, it hinders the work of transporting sperm, thus losing the conditions for pregnancy. In addition, because the testicles are the tools for producing sperm, if orchitis occurs, it is indeed a major threat to reproduction. However, if the testicles have not become hardened, there is still a way to save them.

The only way to prevent orchitis and infertility is to use a rapid method to eliminate the inflammation, so that the tubules that are about to close can restore their normal physiological state due to the subsidence of the inflammation. In this way, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep has been lost. When the orchitis is swollen and drooping, the patient must be instructed to rest, and a specially made testicle suspension should be used to support the drooping scrotum. German Hess serum is also injected to resist gonorrhea, reduce inflammation, and reduce swelling. On the one hand, German Filtered Lymph Flow Electrotherapy is used to directly extinguish gonococci. In this way, within two or three weeks, the symptoms of orchitis can be reduced by sixty to seventy percent, and in five weeks, the inflammation can be completely cured. All pathological conditions can be quickly extinguished. If it is confirmed that it has been cured, the semen should be checked multiple times. If pure sperm can be detected without mixing with other impurities, it can prove that this gonorrhea-related infertility can still return to life like millet in the valley and restore the function of reproduction. This is my practical experience over the past ten years. Many patients who have suffered from gonorrhea-related infertility for many years have been cured by me, and they have all had satisfactory results!

Diagnosis Time: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM

Specialty: Also treats syphilis, buboes, chancres. And painless new method to circumcise the foreskin.

Entertainment World

### The Importance Attached to Children's Films in Various Countries

— Ying

—Written on Children's Day

Film has been recognized as a fast-track tool for assisting children's education, so countries around the world currently attach great importance to children's films. Today is Children's Day, so I want to briefly report to readers the situation of various countries attaching importance to children's films.

United States The United States is an advanced country in the film industry, so film education in the United States is more advanced than in any other country. Many schools in the United States have now purchased projectors and screen children's films every Sunday or holiday. Some of these films are specially produced by public institutions collecting materials and writing scripts, while others are produced by film companies specifically for schools or educational institutions to screen. Even ordinary cinemas show films with educational significance for children, and the ticket prices are reduced very cheaply for children to watch.

England In tradition, the old England, which has some conservative colors in everything, is of course no exception to film, especially for children's films, special attention is paid. When film censorship committees in various places check films, every film must be labeled with the letter A or U. The letter A is an abbreviation of Aduii, which means that only adults are allowed to watch and children are not allowed. The letter U is an abbreviation of Universal, which means that adults and children can watch it. In recent years, the United Kingdom has even set up a national organization to manage children's films, shooting children's films and screening them publicly in public institutions or schools in various places.

Germany The two dictatorial countries of Germany and Italy also attach importance to children's films, but since the rise of fascism, these two countries have successively unified the film industry, using film as a tool for propaganda, with political function more important than entertainment. Therefore, children's films are no exception. Public institutions select materials for children's films, shoot films, some of which are obvious and some of which are suggestive, to promote fascism and national socialism to children. And cinemas and schools often have public screenings of these children's films.

Soviet Union The progress of the Soviet film industry is particularly rapid, prompting anyone to express surprise. Especially for film education, they pay great attention. In Moscow alone, on every holiday, there are more than 500 cinemas, from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm, screening children's films in rotation. The ticket prices are low, which is unseen in other countries. These films, including feature films and cartoons, are produced by the government and are specifically for children aged 8 to 16 to watch. In terms of production, the stories are all targeted at children, which is different from ordinary films.

China Finally, what I want to say is that our Chinese Central Film Censorship Committee does not have a label indicating whether a film is suitable for children to watch, and the country does not have laws prohibiting children from watching certain types of films. However, in recent years, we have also paid great attention to film education. In Shanghai alone, the Chinese Film Education Association has a branch in Shanghai, and often screens specially produced or selected children's films in various primary and secondary schools for free in rotation. It's just that after August 13th, this organization also withdrew with the national army, and temporarily left.

### Communicating Chinese and Foreign Cultures: Performance of the Famous French Play "Carmen" (Part 2) by the Eurasia Theater Company at the Lyceum Theatre

— Bing Du

Introduction to the Script

The author of (Carmen), George Bizet, was born in Paris, France, in 1838. His first opera, Docteur Bliracle, was published in 1857, but it was not until (Carmen) was highly recommended by the great writer Nietzsche that it gained recognition in the art world. The story of this play tells of a young French soldier who falls in love with a Gypsy girl and becomes a thief. However, Carmen is also attracted to the bravery and strength of the bullfighter and discovers the soldier's weakness and mediocrity, leading to a change of heart. In a fit of jealousy, the soldier kills Carmen, ending this tragic love triangle.

The entire play consists of four acts. In addition to depicting a Spanish story, the author also portrays the lives of Gypsies engaged in smuggling and the wandering existence of local ruffians. It possesses the magnificent spirit of Shakespeare's (Romeo and Juliet), especially its delicate and warm atmosphere. However, unlike Shakespeare, who uses the ultimate love between a man and a woman to resolve human hatred, (Carmen) uses a symbol of strength to illustrate the triumph of love.

In the feudal or bourgeois society in men's hearts, especially in France, this play, for those who passionately and unrestrainedly attempt love, (Carmen) will inevitably be a popular drama. However, in (this time) and (this place) Shanghai, (Carmen) does not seem to evoke much interest among Chinese audiences. Firstly, due to national differences, and secondly, due to the particularly volatile art of the times, even operas, which are considered weak, fail to convey their themes as effectively as ( ). Even Chinese local operas are already on the path to decline.

Impressions of the Performance

The performance's achievements were not expected to be overly extravagant, but at least that is my personal impression.

Firstly, apart from Habanera and Toreoder in the second act, which were somewhat listenable, the orchestra conductor, Maestro E. Marcus, did not fulfill his full potential. The soaring and progressive emotions were never naturally grasped, and only some success was achieved in the Feeling interludes. Secondly, the singing technique was insufficient. Several actors, such as M. Speransky (the bullfighter) and G. Sayapin (the army captain), had hoarse voices, which harmed the main conditions for the opera's success and aroused a feeling of disgust. Thirdly, the actors' acting skills were not clearly developed here. Especially the director, his handling of the entire play, except for the crowded scenes in the hotel in the second act and the Gypsy dance scene, was quite commendable. However, scenes like the conviction and imprisonment in the first act and the captain's arrest were not clearly depicted. Furthermore, the scene where Tao Cai tries to assassinate the bullfighter Escamillo lacked even the minimum level of embellishment. I feel that handling a four-hour-long stage play is not easy, especially the difficulties of opera. Under the direction of Mr. S. Ulianov, the entire play felt disorganized and lacked harmony in terms of light, sound, and art. If I didn't put it this way, then a Chinese audience watching a French opera performed by Russians must feel alienated by the two distinct and indelible ancestral divides!

### Red Bean Studio Sponsors Orphan Kunqu Opera Class

— Wang Lan

Previously, I attended a banquet at the Queen's Theatre, held at the Tiantian Restaurant on Guangxi Road. Many editors and colleagues from the press were present. During the banquet, I spoke with Yi Fangshuo, a famous Shanghai comedian, about the orphan school. Among them, there were some children who were learning Kunqu Opera. I hereby record it as follows.

Since the August 13th Incident, there have been many orphans in Shanghai who have lost their homes after being affected by the disaster. Their situation of eating in the wind and sleeping in the open air is extremely miserable. Since these children are the future masters of China, it is unbearable for kind-hearted people to let them suffer from hunger and cold. Therefore, many charitable figures in Shanghai raised funds to establish this orphan school. In the beginning, it was only for the purpose of providing shelter. Later, they provided education and guidance according to their talents, so that they could each find employment and support themselves. Currently, there are some simple industrial manufacturing practices in place, and the products are quite good. However, this is not the subject of this article, so I will omit it for now. Among them, there are some children whose nature is close to drama, so Pu Xiyuan (also known as Pu Dong, also known as Red Bean Studio Master), a famous Kunqu Opera amateur who loves Kunqu Opera, trains them. There are a total of forty people in the class, including sheng, dan, jing, and chou roles, all taught according to their talents, so that they can achieve success. Although it has only been a few months, the results are already quite impressive. In the future, it should not be difficult to add a different color to China's inherent art, which is about to become a fading echo, and to reverse the tide. At the same time, assisting the Red Bean Studio Master are two famous teachers who taught the Xian Ni Society's family troupe in the past. They guide the students diligently every day, sparing no effort, which is also a fortunate thing for the students. According to Mr. Fangshuo, he himself is also one of the sponsors of the school. He heard from the charitable figures in charge of the school that they will further establish beggar schools and newsboy schools in the future, in order to ensure that no talent is wasted and no one is neglected. Among them, newsboys are particularly easy to train, because most newsboys are literate to some extent and can understand ordinary text at a glance. Therefore, it should be relatively easy to start with training. It is also learned that the Municipal Council is willing to provide considerable support for such charitable undertakings (as reported in various newspapers on the 27th of last month). Therefore, everything in the future will be easier to carry out. The reporter wishes to offer sincere prayers for the orphans, beggars, and newsboys, in the hope that they will succeed.

### A Weak Woman's Confession

Sent by Jin Suqin from Hong Kong

Like a bolt from the blue, a warm-hearted friend suddenly sent me many newspaper articles about me from Shanghai, which really left me speechless, dumbfounded, and not knowing whether to laugh or cry. After the August 13th Incident, I was hated and despised by a certain class. Almost every time they saw my name, they would quickly spit on the ground. But at the same time, I made many friends who had always been indifferent to me. I only attribute the former to differences in opinion, and I would never dare to harbor any feelings of animosity. The latter's enthusiastic encouragement gave me a great sense of comfort, which I will always remember and never forget. To say that I, upon leaving Shanghai, would recklessly and indiscriminately satirize my friends in Shanghai for no reason, I think that any friend who knows me a little would not believe that I am so confused, muddleheaded, and unreasonable!

If the editor allows me a chance to confess, I would like to tell the truth. On the second day of my arrival in Hong Kong, I was honored by the kindness of Mr. Liu Qingxuan, Wang Xiaolai, Mao Heyuan, Ruan Weiyang, Hu Hao, and others, who held a tea party for me at the Hong Kong Hotel. The first to speak at the party were Mr. Ruan and Mr. Ouyang. Neither of them said a word about the situation in Shanghai. And when it came to my reply, there were only five short sentences:

"This time, Suqin came to Hong Kong from the isolated island, and what I have done is just a little bit of duty. Today, I am very grateful for the host's hospitality." (See the original text in the newspaper)

In addition, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chen Xiaowei, and Gu Wuwei also gave speeches, but there were no words that stimulated friends in Shanghai. I really don't understand where the reporter who wrote that article got the idea to fabricate such a grand theory for me out of thin air? Although if you want to condemn someone, you can always find a charge, but attacking people should also be based on true and reliable evidence, so that people will be convinced.

I am now attaching a page from a Hong Kong newspaper, and if you could kindly print it to clarify the truth and slightly appease the anger of my friends in Shanghai, then this weak woman would be truly grateful.

The original words recorded by the Hong Kong newspaper can be used as proof.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden (136)

Thirteenth Sister's Filial Piety and Nian Gengyao's Respect for His Teacher

It is said that once he was sitting in a green felt sedan chair during a snowstorm. Suddenly, he felt a pang of compassion and ordered the two guards holding the sedan chair poles to "release their hands." Unexpectedly, the two men simultaneously drew their swords and chopped off the hand that was holding the pole. When he saw this, he realized that his command was too strict. His original intention was because the weather that day was too cold. He himself was sitting in a sedan chair lined with tiger skin cushions, wearing heavy fur clothes, and still felt the cold seeping in. When he looked outside, the two guards holding the sedan chair poles each had one hand exposed to the outside. After being blown by the cold wind, wouldn't they be frozen? Therefore, he had a kind thought and broke the record by issuing a "release your hands" command. In the autocratic era, the majesty of the general was truly extraordinary. He couldn't speak like ordinary people, such as saying, "You two, put down the hand that is holding the sedan chair pole," or saying with great emotion, "It's too cold today, the snow is falling so heavily, and the wind is blowing so hard. Don't you feel cold? If not, put your hands down." It seemed that all these lengthy speeches were not what people in the officialdom should say. People often say "official style," and official style is command-style. A sentence can only use three or two words. General Nian had always been a person who killed without batting an eye. None of his subordinates had ever seen him show kindness. Today, when he told them to release their hands, they never dreamed that he was telling them to take their hands away or move them away. Therefore, in addition to chopping off their wrists to accept the general's order, what other method of delay was there for them to consider? Moreover, military orders are like mountains. A slight hesitation would result in a charge of disobeying orders. If that were the case, how could they protect their heads?

Once, Yongzheng was reviewing troops. Because it was the height of summer and the sun was scorching, the training time was too long, and many soldiers fainted on the ground. Yongzheng then issued an imperial decree to stop the training, but the generals continued to train as usual because they had not received an order from General Nian. Later, Nian Gengyao simply waved the command flag, and the troops dispersed in an instant. Yongzheng thought, my imperial decree is not as effective as his command flag. If Nian Gengyao rebelled in the future, with military power in his hands, it would be impossible to subdue him. Therefore, within a few years, he had General Nian, who had been famous for a time and had shaken the border areas, put to death. (This happened in the third year of Yongzheng's reign.) Thirteenth Sister still felt a great regret for not being able to personally kill the enemy who killed her father.

New Medicine and New Drug Weekly

Commentary

### Pharmacy Creed

—Attention New Drug Industry—

"Genuine Goods at Fair Prices, Honesty with the Elderly and Children" This eight-character phrase is sufficient to encompass commercial ethics. The profession of pharmacy is different from other professions because, in addition to customers and colleagues, there is also the object of the doctor, and in the process of manufacturing, dispensing, and selling, there is actually a hidden crisis of human life. This is the creed that the pharmacy industry should abide by, so it cannot be completely encompassed by ordinary commercial ethics. After quietly observing, I deeply know where the shortcomings of the domestic pharmaceutical industry lie. If we do not prescribe the right medicine and correct them, we cannot improve the status of the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, I propose a creed as a criticism. To know and not speak is called concealment, to speak without justification is called recklessness. The above is what I have proposed and is free from these two extremes! Fellow pharmacists, please do not treat it as mere talk and dismiss it.

(1) Do not manufacture fake or inferior drugs

(2) Do not sell enemy goods

(3) Do not secretly sell prohibited drugs and equipment without a doctor's prescription

(4) Do not entice doctors with commissions

(5) Do not arbitrarily criticize doctors' prescriptions in front of patients

(6) Do not arbitrarily change doctors' prescriptions privately. If there is an error in the doctor's prescription, you should try to notify the doctor to correct it.

(7) Do not exercise the functions of a doctor and secretly prescribe and dispense medication

(8) Do not disclose the secrets of the medical and pharmaceutical industries

(9) Do not make exaggerated advertisements

(10) Do not slander colleagues as unethical competition

### Treatment for Pufferfish Roe Poisoning

— Wen Zanseng

Reading a news item on the fourth page of a certain newspaper on the 11th of this month about pufferfish roe poisoning, a coolie obtained a fish, and eight people shared it. Two people had already died, and the remaining six were still being treated. In order to increase public health knowledge, I will briefly describe the morphology of the pufferfish, its poisoning phenomenon, and methods of prevention:

(1) Morphology of Pufferfish: Pufferfish belong to the carp family. Carp have round bodies and small heads. Scales are of varying sizes. They have dorsal fins. The lower part of the head has a thick, hard horny plate. The mouth has powerful molars on the lower jawbone but no other teeth. The edges of the mouth of this type of fish generally have barbels. They live in freshwater and eat small animals, rarely eating plants. Common in East Asia are Cyprinus carpio, with four barbels on the upper edge of the mouth, and Barbus vulgaris, which also has four barbels, two of which grow at the tip of the mouth. The spawning period is between March and May.

(2) Symptoms and Causes of Pufferfish Roe Poisoning: Pufferfish roe poisoning occurs throughout Europe and Asia. Often, many people are poisoned and die at the same time. The reason is eating pufferfish eggs. The symptoms of poisoning are called "Pufferfish Cholera" (Barbencholera) because the disease is similar to cholera. The main symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Mild cases can be treated, while severe cases often lead to death. In the late 18th century, from 1885 to 1892, the Japanese health authorities announced that the number of deaths from fish poisoning reached 933, of which 681 died. In other words, the number of deaths accounted for 73% of the number of poisoning cases. The most toxic period for fish eggs is when they are about to lay eggs, from March to May. Dr. Tahara discovered that these fish eggs contain toxins, namely Tetrodonin and Tetrodonin acid.

Treatment: Similar to acute gastroenteritis, eat and drink less. Use castor oil as a laxative. For severe cases, use cardiac stimulants and physiological saline infusion. Avoid using antidiarrheal drugs!

Common Sense of Diseases

### Stomach Problems (3)

— Zhuang Weizhong

Doctors use many methods to diagnose gastritis patients. I will briefly describe them to provide some common sense knowledge. Whether the patient has acute or chronic gastritis, doctors examine the medical history in great detail. Patients should provide as much information as possible and listen to the doctor's questions. The medical history contains a lot of reference information for diagnosis. In addition, the vomitus of acute gastritis patients should be kept for the doctor to examine. Also, chronic gastritis patients, even if they do not vomit, may have their stomach contents removed by a stomach tube for examination (there is no great suffering). In clinical practice, the gastric juice of chronic gastritis patients often shows abnormal gastric acid secretion, either decreased or increased, and contains a large amount of mucus. How can this be guessed without examination? Other things like the statement of current symptoms, detailed but concise, should be appropriate. Everything the doctor asks should be answered in detail, with no concealment or exaggeration. All of the above should be common sense for those seeking medical treatment for stomach problems, not just those with gastritis.

As for the prognosis of gastritis patients, although it cannot be certain, it has less direct relationship with life. Acute gastritis, if treated reasonably immediately and following the laws of health, can recover early. Otherwise, it will be prolonged and difficult to cure, and easily turn into chronic gastritis. Among them, toxic gastritis affects not only a local part of the stomach, and the anatomical changes of the stomach are severe. If toxic substances are absorbed, there is a danger to life. Chronic gastritis occurs intermittently and heals repeatedly, complaining of indigestion, anorexia, or a liking for food, but only a small taste is taken. As a result, nutrition is greatly affected, the body becomes thin, and the spirit is unhappy. Therefore, many people suffer from neurasthenia (and neurasthenia patients often have chronic gastritis combined. These two diseases seem to have a chain relationship between them). As a result, body weight is reduced, natural disease resistance is weakened, and other diseases are easily contracted. Sometimes, other stomach diseases continue to occur (such as cancer, or it is originally cancer, and the initial symptoms are not obvious and are regarded as chronic gastritis).

Finally, I will describe the treatment of gastritis (but it must be stated that this is only to show the general outline of the treatment, so that readers can have more common sense about the treatment of gastritis. It is not intended for people to seek self-treatment by following the instructions blindly. Moreover, this kind of disease also needs to be considered at any time in the treatment, and there is no fixed method). For acute gastritis, the first treatment is to remove the cause, preferably washing the stomach with warm water. Stomach washing should be done with a rubber stomach tube. The liquid used for stomach washing can be baking soda water, or plain water (boiled), or saline, or other medicinal liquids, depending on the symptoms. In case of poisoning (food poisoning, chemical poisoning, etc.), appropriate antidote should be used to neutralize it. However, in the case of acid and alkali poisoning, stomach washing and emetics are prohibited to avoid stomach perforation. At the same time, a laxative should be used (which is forbidden in case of acid and alkali poisoning) to facilitate defecation and indirectly reduce stomach inflammation. After the acute symptoms are removed, ordinary mild stomachics can be used. For stomach pain, heat compresses can be used, or hot salt bags can be used for ironing. Anesthetics should not be used unless absolutely necessary. If vomiting is not severe, it can be left alone. If vomiting does not stop, consider using antiemetics. If the fever is high, consider using antipyretics that do not hinder digestion. However, fever in acute gastritis often goes away with other symptoms. Just remove the contents and think about the cause. If the fever is not very high, there is no need to worry too much. During treatment, starvation should be maintained for two or three days, during which only drink a lot of water every day.

The treatment of chronic gastritis is more difficult than that of acute gastritis. First, remove the causative causes. Second, oral hygiene is the most important and should be maintained by gargling from time to time (as in acute gastritis). Third, pay attention to the improvement of diet, with those that are nutritious and easy to digest being the most suitable. Change the taste from time to time to stimulate appetite. Each intake should be small rather than large, and the number of meals can be increased several times. If the condition worsens, try washing the stomach with 0.3% baking soda water, but it should not be done for too long. If the condition improves, drink a large cup of warm salt water half an hour before meals. Other things like appropriate exercise and fresh air are also important.

Clinical Report

### The Experience of Diagnosing and Treating Pneumonia with Diphtheria Complications

— Zhou Zhenyu

Introduction: Although I have encountered several cases of pneumonia complicated by diphtheria, none were as dangerous as this one, nor did any respond as readily to treatment. The reason for this is that we now have new medicines that are beneficial tools in treating diseases. Therefore, I am describing it below for research purposes.

Case History: The patient is a male child, four years old this year, which is actually three years and seven months old. According to his father, on February 8th, the child seemed unwell, didn't like to play, and preferred to sleep. His parents thought he had caught a slight cold and that rest and a restricted diet would suffice. In the middle of the night, they felt his body was burning hot, realizing it was not a cold but an illness. The next morning (February 9th), they took him to see a certain traditional Chinese doctor. The doctor said that evil fire had invaded, and this was one of the winter plagues. Prescribing dispelling evil and reducing fire medicine would cure him. After taking the Chinese medicine, they expected it would lessen the next day (February 10th), but unexpectedly, the illness seemed more severe. So, they took him back to the doctor, who repeated his previous diagnosis, slightly modified the prescription, and instructed them to decoct and administer it. After following the instructions, the illness did not improve but rather worsened. He was in a deep sleep and didn't speak, only occasionally startled, and his breathing was short. The family had recently lost their grandfather, and since the child wasn't noisy, they didn't pay close attention. The next day (February 11th), he still took one dose of Chinese medicine. In the evening, his sleep was restless, and his breathing was even shorter, often gasping for air. His face was pale. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 12th, they went back for a follow-up visit. After modifying the prescription and decocting it, it seemed that there was phlegm rattling up and down in his airways. The frequency of gasping for air seemed to increase. Seeing phlegm in his throat, they thought the medicine was working effectively, and the illness would be cured once the phlegm was expelled. He became even more restless at night, not sleeping for a moment. The next day (February 13th), he took another dose of Chinese medicine, which was specifically for digesting stagnant phlegm, thinking that once the phlegm was gone, his breathing would be smooth. However, the child's spirit became even more listless, his face was even paler, and the frequency of gasping for air increased even more, with his breathing becoming more rapid and shallow. Around 6 or 7 p.m., his breathing sound was loud, as if a mass of phlegm was blocking his airway. The next day (February 14th), they went back for a follow-up visit. The doctor said: "Phlegm is stagnating in the trachea. Once the phlegm is transformed, the illness will be cured, without a doubt. We should quickly use phlegm-resolving medications." So, they decocted and administered another dose according to the prescription. Unexpectedly, his breathing sound became even louder, with a rattling sound constantly audible, and even louder. The frequency of gasping for air increased again, his face became even paler, and he felt pain in the lower left chest, abdominal pain, and a headache. By 10 p.m., he was gasping for air every three to four minutes, sometimes unable to catch his breath. He clenched his hands tightly, straightened his chest, and took a deep breath, which seemed to calm him down a bit. By 12 p.m., his condition worsened, so they telegraphed, requesting that I examine him.

Examination Process: I arrived at 12:15 a.m., which should be considered the morning of the 15th. Visual examination: The child was physically strong, with a pale face, and a deep illness. He was not very thin. His lips were purplish-blue, indicating a state of suffocation. He was gasping for air, about once every two minutes. Every three to five gasps, there was one forced respiration. When performing this respiration, his hands would clench, his chest would straighten, his mouth would open, and the rattling sound was quite loud. Breathing seemed very difficult and quite shallow. His nostrils flared constantly. His parents firmly believed it was caused by phlegm, so they requested surgery to remove the phlegm to ease his breathing. I replied that I would examine him first and then discuss it further. His rectal temperature was 10S.S°F. His respiration, counted by chest and abdominal movement, was 50, and his pulse was 145, very weak.

Percussion: The upper right lung, up to the upper edge of the fourth rib, had a mixed sound of solidity and emptiness. The upper left lung, up to the upper edge of the third rib, had a solid sound.

Auscultation: In the diseased area of the right lung, I heard amphoric and bronchovesicular sounds. In the diseased area of the left lung, I heard crackles and increased breath sounds. From this, it appears that the right lung showed signs of the second stage, and the left lung showed signs of the first stage. At the same time, the child complained of pain in the lower left chest, abdominal pain, and a headache. Except for the area near the affected region, where the breathing sound was slightly louder, the rest showed normal signs. Combining the results of the examination, it was undoubtedly lobar pneumonia, starting in the right lung and then spreading to the left lung. However, his breathing had a rattling sound, clearly indicating that there was a foreign object in the airway. At a time when diphtheria was prevalent, I suspected it was diphtheria causing the trouble. But upon examining his throat, I only saw enlarged and inflamed tonsils, with no other special abnormalities. The child was crying and fussing a lot, making it difficult to examine deeper areas. Therefore, I reluctantly used a mouth gag to open his mouth. I then discovered a large patch of pseudo-membrane on the back of the left tonsil, blackish-gray in color, suitable for becoming a bellows-like valve. There was also a patch of pseudo-membrane behind the right tonsil, but it was smaller and whiter. I immediately took a small amount of mucus and sent it to the pathology laboratory for testing. In the afternoon, I received the report confirming it was diphtheria. (To be continued)

### Hookworm Disease

— Suo Fei

One

The night is deep and silent.

Two

Mrs. Gu woke up from her sleep and nudged Mr. Gu, who was sleeping beside her, gently calling:

"Lao Gu! Lao Gu!"

Mr. Gu was having a sweet dream. He dreamt that he was with his beloved wife, touring West Lake. It was a Mid-Autumn Festival night, a round, crystal-clear bright moon hung high in the still night sky, and one or two white clouds slowly drifted by, like happy boats swaying in the happy sea of the sky. This beautiful scene was reflected in the waters of West Lake, making the lake even more beautiful. He and his beloved wife were sitting in a small pleasure boat, the thin oars gently paddling the lake water, and the boat slowly glided across the surface. It was late at night, and the yachts on the lake were already sparse, with only two or three scattered about. It seemed as if they were competing with the white clouds of the sea of the sky, making the scenery even more beautiful.

The boat gradually approached Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, and suddenly three round bright moons appeared on the surface of the lake. Together with the one in the sky and the one at the bottom of the water, these five bright moons formed a rare and spectacular sight. This beautiful and serene scene intoxicated Mr. Gu and Mrs. Gu. They stopped rowing and nestled close together, their wise eyes sharing the same view, silently admiring the autumn night on West Lake.

"Lao Gu! Lao Gu!" The beloved call of his wife rang in Mr. Gu's ears.

"Oh!" Mr. Gu responded enthusiastically, turned to look at his beloved wife, and their affectionate faces touched, feeling warm as if a fire was burning there.

This feeling of warmth suddenly made Mr. Gu realize that they were not in the beautiful West Lake, but sleeping in a comfortable bed, and he was sleeping comfortably snuggled up with his beloved wife.

"What's the matter, darling?" Mr. Gu rubbed his sleepy eyes and asked gently.

"Our Xiao Qian has been fostered out to another family for almost three years, and we have never gone to see him. I just dreamt that he came," Mrs. Gu woke up Mr. Gu and recounted her dream. "He was so lovely! Fair and chubby, lively and clever. As soon as he saw me, he ran over and threw himself into my arms, as affectionate as if we had been together since childhood. I asked him if he missed his mother, and he said he missed her very much, and he often thought of his father too."

Hearing that his child was being well cared for, Mr. Gu felt a wave of angelic joy and comfort welling up from the bottom of his heart. But thinking that he was already the father of five children, Da Qian, ten years old, You Qian, eight years old, and Zhong Qian, six years old, were already studying in a primary school. Ye Qian, four years old, was about to be sent to kindergarten. The school and living expenses for these four children were already considerable. He was the only one in the family who was selling his labor to earn money, and his ancestors hadn't left behind any property. This heavy burden was enough for him to bear. Although Xiao Qian was lovable, the thought of the future burden unconsciously weighed heavily on his heart.

"I think we should bring him back sooner rather than later," Mrs. Gu looked up, recalling the smiling face of her beloved son, not noticing Mr. Gu's worries. "If the child is fostered out for too long, he will not be affectionate towards his biological parents."

"I don't think so," Mr. Gu remembered the impending pressure and thought that being able to avoid it for a while was good. "The affection between parents and children is, after all, innate. Even if he is fostered out for a few more years, I don't think he will change his nature."

"No, I've seen several families who fostered out their children to other places, and after a long time, they became completely unaffectionate. Don't let our Xiao Qian be fostered out for too long, or he won't be affectionate to us in the future."

"I don't believe it," Mr. Gu knew that there was some truth in Mrs. Gu's words, but he wanted to use some dissenting words to stop his beloved wife's thoughts of her son, and to delay the burden that could not be avoided. "Didn't you just say that he was very affectionate with you?"

"That was just a dream after all, and the dream and the reality may be exactly the opposite," Mrs. Gu, not understanding Mr. Gu's heart, shattered his attempt and said, "For this reason, I'm even more thinking that we should bring him back sooner rather than later, to avoid that he really becomes unaffectionate in the future."

"Wouldn't it be better to bring him back later?" Mr. Gu said in a helpless, almost pleading tone, "Your health is not very good, and the children by your side are already enough trouble for you. Why bother looking for trouble? If we bring him back later, when the child is older, won't it reduce some trouble?"

"No, I miss him so much, you must go and bring him back for me!" Mrs. Gu was so thinking of her young son that she didn't dwell on Mr. Gu's words, and coquettishly insisted that Mr. Gu immediately bring their beloved son back from the foster family.

Mr. Gu loved Mrs. Gu too much, he couldn't bear to make his beloved wife feel uncomfortable. Although this matter would add some weight to his entire burden, and would increase the trouble for his weak wife, he carefully considered it and finally accepted his wife's suggestion.

"Then, I'll go and bring him back tomorrow," when Mr. Gu said this, Mrs. Gu immediately rejoiced, hugged Mr. Gu, and snuggled even closer.

Three

Mrs. Gu's conjecture turned out to be a fact.

Mr. Gu traveled a long distance to bring their young son Xiao Qian back from a small village. The child wasn't as fair and chubby or as lively as Mrs. Gu had seen in her dream, but rather sallow and thin, with a small head, but very large eyes. His hand and leg bones were as thin as firewood, but his stomach was high and bulging, like a balloon filled with air. Moreover, he had an unusual habit: he liked to dig out the lime plastering the walls. When he found a piece, he would stuff it into his mouth, chewing and eating it with great relish. Such a strange child, none of their children had ever been like Xiao Qian. When Xiao Qian was mixed among the children, he looked so out of place that he didn't seem like their son at all.

Although Xiao Qian was not yet three years old, he did not recognize his biological parents at all. Although they kindly taught him to say "This is Daddy," "This is Mommy," he stood there bashfully, staring blankly, refusing to say a word.

"陌陌人！陌陌人！" (Strange person! Strange person!) When Mr. Gu or Mrs. Gu was affectionate with him, he would cry out like this.

Mr. Gu and Mrs. Gu began to feel regret. They regretted being greedy for a moment of ease, and fostering out their own child, who was only three months old when they were born two and a half years ago. Although liking children is human nature, and others may also love and caress the child, after all, they are not your own. There is a layer in between, and it is inevitable that they cannot take care of you thoughtfully. Children need the care of adults. Cold, heat, hunger, fullness, the trivialities of daily life can only be patiently accepted by biological parents, without fear of trouble.

Obviously, Xiao Qian's appearance was not normal. He also had a slight fever every afternoon, and when he had a fever, he was slightly short of breath, which added endless worries to his parents' hearts.

"Let's get a doctor to take a look. The child has a fever every day, maybe he has malaria," Mrs. Gu looked at the strangely shaped child, with more love than pity, and asked Mr. Gu for his consent, saying, "I heard that there are many mosquitoes in the countryside, so it's hard to avoid getting malaria."
