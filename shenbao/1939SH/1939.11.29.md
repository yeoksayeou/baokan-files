### New Guilin Chinese Army Deploys New Positions, Prepares to Surround Japanese Army; Japanese Army's Rear Supply Difficult, Chinese Army Secretly Restrains Them; Cantonese Chinese Army Attacks Xinhui and Nanhai, Destroys Many Japanese Barracks

Chongqing: News that the Japanese army has occupied Nanning was officially acknowledged by the Chinese side for the first time today. This afternoon, a Chinese military spokesperson announced to reporters that Nanning fell on Sunday. Chinese and Japanese forces are currently in a stalemate in the mountains about 20 to 30 kilometers north and northeast of Nanning. The vanguard of the Japanese army crossed the Jiang River on November 23. The next day, the Japanese army arrived in the suburbs of Nanning. Fierce fighting lasted all day on the 25th. The next day, Nanning was occupied by the Japanese army. The Chinese army has withdrawn to positions north and northeast of Nanning. However, the Chinese army along the Nanning-Beihai highway continues to restrain the rear of the Japanese army. (Reuters, 28th)

Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesperson today, the Chinese army in Guangxi is now infiltrating behind the Japanese army from all directions, attempting to encircle the Japanese in the Nanning area. The Japanese army's current incursion is a planned strategy by the Chinese side to create a converging encirclement. It was also stated that the Chinese army abandoned Nanning last Saturday. The Chinese army has now retreated to the mountains 30 kilometers outside Nanning. The spokesperson also said that the Japanese army may establish an air force base in Nanning to threaten the Chinese interior. (United Press, 28th)

Chongqing: According to news here today, although the Chinese army has withdrawn from Nanning, it is still fiercely fighting the invading Japanese army near Nanning. Although the Japanese army has reached Nanning, it is extremely difficult to secure supplies for their rear, because the highway from Qinzhou to Nanning has been destroyed by the Chinese side. At the same time, due to the rugged terrain, the Japanese army's heavy artillery cannot enter. The Chinese side has now moved to new positions and is preparing for a major counterattack against the Japanese army. (United Press, 28th)

Chongqing: According to news here today, although the war in South China has affected the Jiang River basin, the military authorities in Guilin are very optimistic about the future. They believe that the deeper the Japanese army penetrates, the more likely the Chinese army will be to recreate a major victory like the Battle of Changsha. The gains and losses of one place have little impact on the overall situation. The Japanese army has already suffered considerable losses on the way from the coast to Nanning, but future losses will be even greater, because the journey the Japanese army is taking is 100 kilometers long and narrow, with no Chinese workers or food. As for the Japanese claim that the invading army in Nanning has three divisions, in reality it only has one and a half divisions. The artillery they brought is mostly small and old. According to refugees from Qinzhou, only one Japanese division landed in Qinzhou, and one and a half brigades landed in Fangcheng. (United Press, 28th)

Chongqing: The war report from the front remains optimistic about the Nanning battle. One prediction is that the Chinese army will annihilate the Japanese army trapped on the banks of the Jiang River sooner or later. It is said that the Japanese army in Guizhou province is currently deployed in two locations: one on the north bank of the Jiang River, and the other between the south bank of the Jiang River and Beihai. A Japanese column is now venturing deep into Nanning from the western Guangdong coast. Their food supply is gradually running out. The position of the Japanese army on the north bank of the Jiang River is very vulnerable. The Chinese army is currently attacking it from the north, west, and east, while the Jiang River cuts off its retreat to the south. The Chinese war report also hints that the commander-in-chief of the Southwest Chinese Army will soon order a general counterattack against the Japanese army that has penetrated into Guizhou province.

On the morning of the 26th, they took advantage of the momentum to attack the Japanese army at Mashan on the Xinhui-He Road. Fierce fighting lasted all day. The Japanese greatly reinforced, and the Chinese then transferred. In this battle, more than 400 Japanese were killed and a large number of war spoils were seized. (28th dispatch)

Zhaoqing: The Chinese army attacked Xinhui again on the evening of the 26th, engaging in mixed combat with the Japanese in the suburbs all night.

Bridges along the Jiangmen-Xinhui highway were completely destroyed. (28th dispatch)

Another route, about 200 soldiers, advanced towards Xuhou Bridge and came into contact with the Chinese army near Dongxi Tomb. Another small group of Japanese soldiers attacked Liancheng. The Chinese army countered the attacks separately. Fierce fighting lasted until evening. Chinese surprise troops suddenly launched a flank attack near Renzhong Village.

Editorial

### Expectations for the Soviet Union

The serious situation between the Soviet Union and Finland cannot be ignored as long as it remains unresolved; first, because the severity is difficult to limit, and second, because the scope of the severity is difficult to limit. If it can be resolved, it is a great fortune. If it cannot be resolved, it will inevitably worsen and become uncontrollable. If it cannot be controlled, there is a great possibility of involving third and fourth countries and creating a European war era situation. Playing with soldiers is like playing with fire. The result of expansion often exceeds expectations. When Japan launched its military aggression against China, it never expected that the war would continue for two and a half years without being able to stop. When Germany opened fire on Poland, it thought it could repel Britain and France with a peaceful offensive. It never expected that it would have to prepare to bet its life on the Western Front. As far as the Soviet-Finnish situation is concerned, the "facts" of the disputes reported by the two countries are very different, and it is unknown which is true. However, it is logically impossible to judge that Finland would take the initiative to cause disputes and provoke by firing. However, the Soviet Union not only used international propaganda to say that Finland provoked, as if to say that Finland should be responsible, but also used domestic propaganda that the border and security were actually oppressed by Finland, igniting a fiery flame for the use of force against Finland!

Given the far-reaching international ambitions of the Third International, we cannot imagine that the Soviet Union would be willing to personally engage in dangerous and foolish wars, unless it encountered unbearable provocation, unless sacrificing two or three thousand people could gain 200,000 miles of land! Therefore, we also cannot imagine that the Soviet Union is willing to fight a real war against Finland this time. Events sometimes exceed expectations. The Soviet Union is not as calm as it used to be, and has launched its official newspapers and open-air rallies. These are the main weapons before using real force, making the Soviet people feel that it is unbearable and making the Soviet people express the "grand wish to liberate the Finnish people from the high pressure of capitalism." Although Finland has stated that it accepts the Soviet Union's request to withdraw its troops 25 kilometers from the border, it also reciprocally requests the Soviet Union's border guards to withdraw as well. Resolving difficulties with reciprocal conditions seems to be fair, and disputes should hopefully be resolved. What is not optimistic is that the Soviet Union's recent international rhetoric does not contain the word "reciprocal," so Finland's response may be considered unsolvable by the Soviet Union.

If the Soviet Union truly "cannot bear it" and uses force against Finland, and if the Finnish people, without waiting for the so-called encouragement from Britain and the United States, can know how to defend themselves and fight against the war, then the strong bullying the weak and the many oppressing the few, victory will certainly belong to the Soviet Union. The certainty of victory is an important argument for not asserting that the Soviet Union will not personally engage in war, although we earnestly hope that the Soviet Union will seriously consider it. If the war is won in one fell swoop, the matter is extremely simple, but Finland is a free barrier, and the timing and location may cause the Soviet Union to encounter considerable difficulties. Moreover, the use of force, and even after victory, will directly and indirectly induce various inevitable consequences in the international arena. As it stands: the war between Britain, France, and Germany is one link in the international problem, and the Soviet-Finnish dispute is another link. Although each link has its own center of gravity and its own possibility of individual resolution, the result of deterioration and expansion will turn Europe into a great furnace and merge into one. The Soviet Union will then become a member of it, no longer able to transcend the environment and have a significant influence. The Soviet Union's possible achievements in Finland may be even greater than its achievements in Poland. The Soviet Union's meaning for Finland may be regarded as no different from that for Poland, but the impression it gives to the international community, that is, the evaluation made by the international community, is completely different. Even if the Soviet Union disregards international impressions and evaluations, the reaction to the attitudes of various countries towards the Soviet Union in the future will inevitably make the Soviet Union feel new obstacles. From the past few years to the present, under the various international dynamics, countries compared with each other, all those who participate in hegemony have either proved their failure, or exposed their decline, or are in the middle of a desperate fight, and the victory or defeat and survival is unknown. Only the United States in the Americas is a success story, and the Soviet Union in Europe is a winner. Japan and Germany believe in violence to fight for hegemony, but they have doomed themselves to a tragic fate. Even if it is said that Japan and Germany cannot be said to have failed now, at least they are already trapped in deep waters! It is necessary to know that a gentle embrace and a ferocious face are definitely not different paths leading to the same goal, and they are definitely not each with their own merits. At the same time, it is also necessary to know that survival and freedom are the inevitable desires of mankind, and small and weak nations are definitely not lowly animals. Therefore, for all of these reasons, we are planning for the Soviet Union, rather than changing its style, following Germany, and not hesitating to jump into the oil pot and attempt to invade Finland. It is better to preserve sincerity, develop the truth, and strive to practice the slogans of assisting small and weak nations over the years, and to take the expansion of justice and the restoration of peace as its own responsibility!

### Difficult to Renew US-Japan Trade Treaty Due to Japanese Troops Not Withdrawing from China; Just Voice of the American Public; Anti-Japanese Association to Conduct Nationwide Publicity; Urging the Government to Ban Military Supplies to Japan

New York: The New York "Daily News" editorialized yesterday, "The US government's cancellation of the 1911 US-Japan trade treaty has given the United States a more advantageous position in negotiations on the Far East issue. Now is the time to tell Japan that the price of renewing the US-Japan trade treaty is that they must withdraw troops from China. We must use this opportunity to make Japan submit." The New York "Daily News" is the largest-selling newspaper in the United States. This editorial can represent a change in American public opinion. A year ago, the newspaper wrote to urge the government to adopt a laissez-faire policy towards the Far East. (United Press, 28th)

New York: The American "Anti-Japanese Aggression" Committee announced yesterday that they will hold a nationwide publicity campaign to urge the government to issue an order banning the sale of military materials and other materials to Japan.

This committee will enthusiastically support Senator Hudeman's proposal to stop trade with Japan, which will be submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. (United Press, 28th)

### Chongqing Groups Send Telegrams to Borah Calling for Justice; Japanese Militarists Use American Military Supplies to Invade China and Slaughter Civilians

Chongqing: According to a United Press report, Senator Borah, a leader of the American isolationist faction, said that US-Japan trade is gradually increasing, and we should not hastily abolish the trade treaty without reason. Yesterday, various civic groups in this city jointly sent a telegram to Borah, calling for justice and peace. The original telegram is recorded below: "Senator Borah of the Washington Senate, we have carefully listened to your speech, in which you said that US-Japan trade is gradually increasing and should not be stopped hastily without reason. We dare to solemnly tell you, based on humanitarianism, that the atrocities of the Japanese militarists in China and their slaughter of our people are excellent reasons for the United States to stop trading with Japan. If you study the development of US-Japan trade, you will know that this kind of trade is almost entirely built on military raw materials, which is the tool that Japan uses to invade China. This commercial interest comes from the blood of millions of Chinese people, including men, women, and children. We dare to ask you to use the power of justice and humanity to stop it. The China National Diplomacy Association, the National Women's Association, the General Association of Frontline Anti-Japanese Soldiers, the China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League, the Chongqing New Life Movement Promotion Association, the Chinese Seamen's Union, and the Friends of the Wounded Soldiers Association, respectfully kowtow." (28th dispatch)

### Dr. Brown Criticizes Borah

Chongqing: US Senator Borah recently made a speech advocating that US-Japan commercial relations should be considered. Dr. Brown, chairman of the China Church Hospital United Committee, opposed Borah's position. His original text is as follows: "Senator Borah and the isolationists hope to preserve American commercial interests. The 500 colleagues of the American church hospitals in China were surprised and saddened to hear this. Our colleagues serve the wounded and sick people in China and deeply understand their suffering, either poisoned by the indiscriminate bombing of Japanese aircraft or killed by the atrocities of enemy troops. However, Senator Borah and his colleagues advocate maintaining the trade that is mainly based on military supplies. It must be known that the suffering and abuse suffered by the Chinese people all come from the hands of countries that buy American goods. If the United States continues to maintain commerce, it is tantamount to acquiescing to this inexcusable atrocity. What China is encountering today is like the American War of Independence. This winter is a critical time to turn defeat into victory. The Chinese people are fighting for the freedom and independence of their motherland. Can we, the American people, be driven by greed and used by others, and be willing to help harm the Chinese people? According to Dr. Brown, who recently went to the front and rear of fifteen provinces to inspect the relief work, which lasted for a year, the relief work in China is attended by people from all countries. Their work is extremely difficult, and their responsibilities are extraordinarily important. Service personnel often feel inadequate, medical supplies are very lacking, and hospitals are too small. Patients often exceed capacity by two or three times. When performing surgery, assistants are not trained. In addition, Japanese planes constantly bombed indiscriminately, and hospitals were often damaged. Whenever there was an air raid, patients had to be moved into air-raid shelters several times a day. If the hospital was destroyed, the medical equipment had to be dug out of the rubble and a new location had to be found. Of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who were spared the disaster of the epidemic, the relief workers made great contributions. They endured many hardships, but none left their posts. They all have the ideals of the founding of the United States, fighting for freedom and equality. Will the American people help the relief workers in China, or will they abandon them in favor of money that is ill-gotten? This still remains to be decided by the people of the country." (28th dispatch)

### Japanese Planes Bomb Churches in Sichuan and the US

Peiping: It was learned here today that the American Christian United Church in Xiushan County, Sichuan Province, was bombed by Japanese planes on November 10. Although several large American flags were planted on the roof of the church, the Japanese planes turned a blind eye and still dropped two bombs. A foreigner's residence was destroyed. Fortunately, the American church staff escaped in advance, so there were no casualties. According to news received by the church here, Japanese planes dropped a total of 20 explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on Xiushan. Many civilian houses near the American church were burned down, and the Chinese who died were saving people. (United Press, 28th)

### Dr. Bethune Dies of Illness

Chongqing – According to the Xinhua Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, this morning, Dr. Bethune, a Canadian physician in the Chinese Communist Party army, died of blood poisoning on November 13th after contracting an infection while treating wounded soldiers near the front lines in the Jin-Cha-Sui border region. The newspaper only mentioned Dr. Bethune's Chinese name "Bo Quan (transliteration)." No one among the Chinese Communist Party members here knew Dr. Bethune's English name. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued a condolence telegram today, expressing admiration for Dr. Bethune's work over the past two years. According to people in the Canadian Church here speaking to the Reuters reporter today, there were two Canadian physicians in the Chinese Communist Party army, one being Dr. Bethune from the Canadian Church in Henan Province, and the other being Dr. Bethune. However, Dr. White returned to his country some time ago, so it is believed that the deceased must be Dr. Bethune. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

London – Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that measures to block German export trade will be implemented starting next month, April 4th. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

London – Regarding the matter of blocking German export trade, the order signed by King George VI yesterday will be promulgated at 5:30 PM today, at which time the Ministry of Economic Warfare will also issue a statement explaining it and formally notify the envoys of various neutral countries, declaring that Britain has made every effort to take into account the interests of those countries. These blockade measures are completely identical to the plan formulated by the French government and are scheduled to be implemented simultaneously on April 4th next month. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

London – The government issued a notice to the business community this morning, stating that the Allied governments have decided to block enemy export trade. All ships sailing from Germany and ships sailing from various countries to Germany will be subject to the same control as ships entering. Shipping companies should instruct ships to dock at bases under British or French control. Ships sailing from ports in the Mediterranean or Black Sea should dock at Malta, Haifa, Port Said, or Gibraltar, or at Marseille or Oran in France. Those who do not comply will be escorted elsewhere for inspection. Any enemy products or enemy goods that must be unloaded at British ports will be kept in the custody of the President of the Prize Court. If the goods are clearly identified as enemy property, the court may order them to be transferred to the British King for use or sold. The proceeds will be kept by the court. The proceeds and unsold goods will be disposed of by the court when peace is declared. The proceeds should be paid out, or the detained goods should be released at any time, or the court may decide, subject to the following conditions: (1) Proof that the goods became the property of a neutral country before November 27, 1939; (2) Approval from an official appointed by the British King, subject to the following conditions: (1) Goods carried on ships that left the last neutral port before December 11, 1939; (2) The order was placed before November 27, 1939, and according to the terms of the order, the buyer must take delivery before shipment, and the buyer has paid for the goods before shipment. The ship carrying the goods left the last neutral port before January 1, 1940. Merchants who wish to ensure that goods shipped from European countries are not delayed or detained should obtain a certificate of origin from the British or French consular officials stationed in the relevant European countries. This certificate should accompany the goods loaded on the ship, which will greatly facilitate inspection of the ship at the control base. Therefore, shipping companies must not accept goods loaded without this certificate. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Paris – The government promulgated an order today to block German export trade, mainly stipulating that all kinds of goods loaded in enemy ports and shipped after December 4th of this year may be intercepted by the French competent authorities and ordered to be unloaded in the ports of the British and French Allies. In accordance with the general principles of international law and current regulations, these goods and ships will be detained or captured. Other places occupied or controlled by the enemy should be regarded as enemy territory, and all goods belonging to these places should also be regarded as enemy property. In addition, the French government issued a statement elaborating on this order, stating that France is forced to wage war against Germany to defend the fundamental right of all nations to live and thrive in a free and peaceful environment. The German government has disregarded the guarantees it has repeatedly provided, violated international law and humanitarian principles, and blatantly implemented various acts of violence. To name a few prominent examples, it has violated the 1936 Protocol on Submarine Warfare, abused torpedoes to sink merchant ships of both France and neutral countries, and violated the 1907 Hague International Convention by laying mines indiscriminately without prior notice, destroying many merchant ships, causing many non-combatants, including British and French, and innocent women and children to be killed or injured. This proves that Germany is determined to use illegal and inhumane means to prevent Britain and France from trading with other countries by sea. France is compelled to do so and has full right to take retaliatory measures to prevent all German goods from being transported abroad, but is willing to preserve the legitimate interests of neutral countries. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Paris – The government will promulgate the measures to block German export trade by order tomorrow, and explain that the British and French retaliatory measures are due to Germany's use of illegal and inhumane warfare methods. The British government will issue the same order a few hours later, and the British and French envoys stationed abroad will notify the exporters of the countries where they are stationed of these measures, and inform them that they will be implemented a few days later to allow exporters to take the necessary measures to adapt to these measures. After its implementation in the future, the inspection of German export goods will be handled by the existing inspection committee (used to inspect German imports). Regarding this matter, Blockade Minister Zhaerno recently gave a speech to reporters from various countries, stating that Germany, on the pretext that the blockade policy implemented by Britain and France is aimed at its people, disregards the Hague International Convention signed by the country and conducts illegal and inhumane naval warfare, sinking ships of various countries indiscriminately and forcing innocent passengers, innocent women and children of various countries to be tragically drowned. Under these circumstances, the British and French governments have the right to take various new measures to block their export trade, thereby cutting off their foreign exchange income, but at the same time, they must do their best to protect the rights of various neutral countries, and pay serious attention to their legitimate interests. Regarding the inspection of German export goods, Britain and France have decided to handle it by the existing inspection committee. All kinds of goods that prove to be clearly belonging to various neutral countries and have nothing to do with Germany should still be allowed to circulate as usual. After the German export trade is blocked, the markets that the country previously gained through dumping can now be recovered by various neutral countries and Britain and France. However, since British and French industries must focus on the manufacture of military supplies during the war, the development of this new market is a good opportunity for various neutral countries to develop export trade. We must finally declare one point, that is, the measures decided by the British and French governments this time are the same as those implemented during the previous European War, that is, from 1995 to 1917. If various neutral countries suffer some inconvenience as a result, they should also be aware that Britain and France are making significant sacrifices to protect the world, and temporarily endure it, which is the minimum contribution to this mission.

### German Mine Warfare – Britain Still Has Confidence – Current Impact Is Limited – Countermeasures Can Take Effect

London – Some people may have alarming views on German mine warfare, but this is not the case here, for several reasons: (1) Magnetic mines are not new, they were already used in the previous Great War, and countermeasures do exist. The British Navy is currently improving countermeasures at an abnormal rate. (2) The western ports of Britain and France are completely unaffected by mines. (3) Even if the eastern ports of Britain are affected, it is limited. For example, since the indiscriminate mine warfare began, there has been no closure or prohibition of shipping in the eastern ports. Even during the period of the greatest loss of ships, a large number of shipping convoys still sailed through the mine area and arrived at their destinations safely. (4) The Danish Ministry of Commerce announced the existence of a "sea lane" through which ships from Scandinavian countries can sail from Skagerrak to the British coast, showing that Denmark still intends to maintain exports to Britain as before. (5) According to observers, the use of new methods of warfare that violate international law, although they may achieve initial success, are only temporary, and methods to counter these new weapons are quickly discovered. History shows that the use of illegal means is ultimately self-defeating. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

New York – The New York Post today published an essay by naval expert Ielsburg, stating that Germany's mine warfare may indicate that its submarine warfare has failed. Germany must sink 20,000 to 30,000 tons of ships every day for several months in order to win the naval war, but Germany is far from the above record, whether using mines or torpedoes.

The content was quite strong. At that time, the British Foreign Minister replied to Ambassador Shigemitsu, "The British government has to stop German export trade, but it will give the best consideration to the impact on Japan." The British Foreign Minister will also give a formal reply within days. (Domei dispatch, 27th)

Berlin – "German General Report" columnist Cerix published an article today entitled "Protests Are Useless," claiming that in the past week, Italy, Japan, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium have successively lodged protests with the British Foreign Office against the blockade measures. Other countries such as Norway have also expressed their opposition to Britain in newspapers. The result has created a tense situation between Britain and various neutral countries. Germany should do its best to resist Britain's blockade measures. At the same time, it solemnly announces to various neutral countries that they must adhere to true neutrality, otherwise it will not be a safe path for the neutral countries themselves.

### British Parliament Reconvenes – Simple Ceremony – King Reads Address

London – Parliament reconvened today. Members of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons held a joint meeting in the House of Lords in the morning, presided over by King George VI himself. However, due to the war, the ceremony was relatively simple. According to custom, the King and Queen should have arrived in a four-horse carriage, but this time they only arrived in an ordinary sedan car. They entered hand in hand and approached the throne. At that time, the King's brother, the Duke of Gloucester, and the Duke of Kent were already standing by their side. The House of Lords was also fully present. All members of the House of Commons were then summoned to the House. The Lord Chancellor knelt and presented the address, which was read by the King, stating, "This war requires the collective efforts of all subjects of the country. We are very pleased that the various autonomous territories can fully cooperate and make various contributions. Our fleet is leading merchant fleets and armed fishing fleets around the world to maintain freedom of navigation. The land and air forces are also fulfilling their defense responsibilities on the French front and at home and abroad, and will be able to cope with it. Even if there are sacrifices, we will not hesitate. Members of both houses, your responsibilities are also very arduous. You will be able to express the determination of our nation. The government will ask the members of the House of Commons to pass a finance bill to raise military expenses. In short, the bills to be proposed by the government are for the welfare of all subjects of the country, and are really necessary. May God bless you." (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### British War Expenditure – £6 Million Per Day – Australia Actively Trains Pilots – Greatest Determination to Cooperate with Britain

London – At the end of last week, Ottawa broadcast an official statement, stating Australia and Canada's determination to provide the greatest cooperation with Britain's war effort. It is said that Australia's expenses will reach £50 million in the first year of the war, almost four times the expenses in the first year of the last war, and the number of people being trained is also twice as high as before. 20,000 aircraft pilots are now fully trained in Australia. In addition, there are thousands of Australian air combatants being trained in Canada. It is estimated that Canada's economy for the first year of the war is £63 million. Since the start of the war, goods have been ordered, including Canadian supplies and defense equipment worth £5 million, supplies from the UK worth £1 million, and aircraft from the US worth £2 million. Currently, Britain spends £6 million per day on the war. Although this number is higher than the daily expenditure in the later stages of the last war, it accounts for a smaller proportion of the national income. Queensland government statistician Clark, known for compiling national income, estimated that in 1918, 60% of the UK's national income was used for war purposes, but today it may not exceed 40%. The output of British industry is currently half as much as in 1918, which shows that a war expenditure of £6 million per day is not the greatest effort that Britain can afford economically, but Germany "has indeed exhausted all its economic preparations and cannot make greater efforts."

### German-Danish Trade Adjustment – Negotiations Proceed Smoothly

Copenhagen – German-Danish trade negotiations are expected to conclude today, and a joint declaration will be issued, outlining the course of the negotiations. British newspapers have been spreading rumors in recent days, attempting to undermine the German-Danish negotiations. For example, the "Daily Telegraph" reported on the 25th that Germany was using torpedoes to pressure Denmark, Sweden, and other countries, but the Danish authorities responsible immediately issued a denial, proving that the British newspaper's report was inaccurate. Britain and Denmark have repeatedly decided to hold trade negotiations, but no agreement has been reached on the price of Danish agricultural products. Since the German-Danish trade negotiations began, there have been no frictions, and they are about to end at the same time. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

### Naval Department Announces: Details of German Ship Sinking British Ship. Outnumbered and Hit in North Atlantic. Ship Caught Fire and Sank After Three Hours of Fighting.

London - The Naval Department announced today the details of the merchant ship "Rawalpindi" (16,697 tons) being sunk by the German pocket battleship "Deutschland." This merchant ship, converted into a cruiser, was responsible for patrolling the northern region, inspecting contraband, and preventing German trade. On the 23rd of this month, at 3:30 PM, while patrolling southeast of Iceland, it spotted an enemy ship. Captain Kennedy, using binoculars, identified it as the German ship "Deutschland." He immediately ordered preparations for battle and changed course to position the enemy ship on the starboard side, while also releasing a smokescreen for cover. Unexpectedly, another enemy ship appeared on the starboard side. The "Deutschland" was also speeding towards them. Orders were given to stop the ship, but they were ignored, and it continued forward. A cannonball then passed over the bow. The "Deutschland," seeing the warning ineffective, fired its 11-inch guns simultaneously, launching the first attack. This was at 3:45 PM, at a distance of 10,000 yards. The "Rawalpindi" returned fire with its four 6-inch guns on the starboard side. The enemy ship continued to fire, and its third shell destroyed the British ship's lights and the electrical winch for supplying ammunition. The fourth shell completely destroyed the bridge and the radio room. By this time, both enemy ships had approached, and the second enemy ship circled to the rear of the British ship, firing from the port side. The "Rawalpindi" was attacked from both sides. After all the guns were destroyed and the entire ship was ablaze, after a cruiser converted from a merchant ship fought two heavily equipped formal enemy ships for three to forty minutes, the enemy ships ceased firing. At this time, the British ship lowered three lifeboats. One of them was already leaking. The other two carried more than thirty people, who were likely captured by the enemy ships. Eleven crew members jumped into the sea and swam to the leaking lifeboat, escaping capture by the German ships. Around 6:15, they saw a British ship approaching and immediately fled. It was already dark and raining heavily, and the British cruiser could not pursue. The eleven crew members adrift at sea were later rescued by the British company steamer "Chitral." The remaining crew members sank with the ship, flying the national flag. By 8:00 PM, the raging fire on the ship was no longer visible. (20th Reuters)

Berlin - The German High Command announced that Britain, to avoid its fleet being attacked by German submarines and air forces in the North Sea and North Atlantic, deemed it necessary to withdraw British warships from that area. The result of the British-German naval battle near Iceland exposed Britain's weakness. When the British auxiliary cruiser "Rawalpindi" opened fire with the German fleet, the sky was dark, but the German warships were still able to hit their targets. Before long, the "Rawalpindi's" ammunition hold exploded, and the ship sank. The sailors rescued by the Germans were all Scotsmen. (28th Haitong)

Berlin - The German High Command announced today that several German warships, under the command of Naval Undersecretary Marshall, patrolled the North Atlantic, scouting between Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

### Finland Responds to Soviet Union, Advocates Joint Withdrawal of Troops, Soviet Attitude is Firm

Helsinki - Regarding the border dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union, after the Soviet Union demanded that Finnish troops withdraw 25 kilometers from the border, the Finnish government submitted a reply tonight, stating that it was willing to comply, but on the condition that Soviet troops also withdraw the same distance from the border. It stated that Finland's consistent position, as expressed in talks with the Soviet Union, need not be repeated. Regarding the incident that occurred at 3:45 PM yesterday, Finnish border guards did not open fire. In fact, the artillery fire came from Menila, which is located within Soviet territory. The point of impact was approximately 800 meters from the border and was clearly visible from the Finnish side, indicating that Finland did not initiate a provocative action. However, to avoid further complications, it is still willing to accept the Soviet Union's request, but on the condition that Soviet troops also withdraw 25 kilometers. (27th Havas)

Helsinki - When the border dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union occurred on the 26th of this month, General Mannerheim, Chief of Staff of the Finnish Army, was inspecting the border area and has now returned here. According to him, the farthest range of the field guns stationed in the border area is 20 kilometers from the border. The heavy artillery positions are at least 50 kilometers from the border, indicating that Finnish shells could not have fallen within Soviet territory. Furthermore, the 16th of this month was a Sunday. On that afternoon, Finnish border guard officers and soldiers were participating in religious ceremonies, so how could they have shelled the Soviet Union? (28th Havas)

Moscow - General Baochukov, commander of the Leningrad Military District, issued a notice to the troops stationed in the area: "Finnish troops have provoked our border guards in the Menila area of the Karelian Isthmus by opening fire. I hereby order the troops to immediately return fire if Finnish troops repeat such provocative acts, until the aggressors are completely annihilated." (28th Havas)

Moscow - The recent provocative actions of Finnish troops on the Soviet-Finnish border have aroused extreme indignation among the Soviet people. After the news of the Red Army being shelled by the Finns for no reason was broadcast on the radio last night, workers at factories and railways immediately held meetings. Today, meetings are being held across the country. At the meetings, workers, employees, intellectuals, and Red Army soldiers expressed speeches, all supporting the Soviet government and demanding that Finnish troops withdraw from the border near Leningrad, and declaring with great indignation that the Soviet people would not tolerate any new provocations and would protect the safety of Leningrad and the border. The Red Star newspaper also published a joint letter from several Red Army soldiers: "We will bravely defend the motherland. Those who challenge us viciously kill our comrades-in-arms. We will retaliate tenfold. If the Finnish rulers want to test the armament and the power of the officers and soldiers of the Soviet Red Army, they are welcome to try, but they will regret it later. Our answer to the challengers is only ruthless annihilation." (27th TASS)

New York - The Soviet Union's demands on Finland have been severely criticized by the New York Times, which stated that the Soviet Union's attitude is the same as Germany's, and the significance of the Soviet Union's policy of aggression is even greater than that of Germany. If the Soviet Union follows in the footsteps of the National Socialist Party and achieves its goals, other countries will inevitably follow suit. "This is a key moment in the current war, because if small countries cannot survive, the world will become a brutal world, and even the major powers will continue to compete endlessly." (28th Havas)

### US Fiscal Budget Falls Short This Year, Public Debt Issued to Make Up For It

Washington - Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced that due to a budget deficit of $1.6 billion to date, the government plans to issue $500 million in treasury bills from December 8th to inject funds, with an interest rate of 2% and repayment in installments over nine to eleven years. According to political figures here, after the issuance of these treasury bills, the total amount of domestic public debt will reach $42 billion, and the maximum limit set by both houses of Congress is $45 billion, which is not much different. This is a major problem facing the current government, because it is not appropriate for the government to ask both houses of Congress to raise this limit before next year's general election. For the government's sake, it must reduce expenditures, increase taxes, or take other appropriate measures to balance the budget so that the budget deficit for this year does not exceed $3 billion. Then, the maximum limit of domestic public debt will not be broken. (27th Havas)

### All India Congress Passes Resolution Rejecting Cooperation With Britain, Seeking to Implement Independence Proposals

Amsterdam - According to reliable news from India, the All India Congress passed a resolution to avoid being drawn into the war and refused to cooperate with the British authorities in India unless Britain changed its attitude towards India and accepted India's demands. Regarding the issue of Indian independence, the All India Congress' resolution believes that the establishment of an Indian constitutional assembly followed by the establishment of an Indian executive council is the only way to stop Britain's imperialist policies. At the same time, it can allow the All India Congress and Britain to consider future British-Indian cooperation issues. (28th Haitong)

Kabul - Several days ago, armed natives ambushed a British military vehicle near Trasmanerkan in northwestern India.

### Principal Culprit in the Nakajima Assassination Case Arrested

Tokyo - On October 4th, Nakajima Chikuhei, president of the Seiyukai Innovation Group, was attacked on the way home by car. The perpetrator fled. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department made great efforts to search for the perpetrator. In mid-November, a strong suspect was arrested in some way and seriously interrogated. As a result, on the 28th, it was found that Watanabe Michiharu, a martial artist living in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo, was the real perpetrator, and Miura Yoshiichi, president of the Kokka-sha, was a co-offender. The authorities immediately sent personnel to arrest them. The handgun used by the two was supplied by Kobiwara Ritoshi, a ronin who was arrested in Fukuoka on the 11th of this month. The motive for the assassination was to intimidate Nakajima into providing funds for "ultra-right-wing movement." (28th Allied Press)

### Japanese Army's Attempt to Invade Nanning, Wishful Thinking to Use Nanning as a Base for Invading Yunnan and Guizhou

Hong Kong Correspondence - Since the Japanese launched the so-called new offensive in South China with both political and military motives, the situation in Guangdong Province has become increasingly tense. At the end of last month, twenty or thirty Japanese warships continuously patrolled the sea off the Leizhou Peninsula. On the 29th, six Japanese warships once bombarded Yangjiang and sent troops to land, but they were repelled by the Chinese army. On the 10th, Japanese warships again bombarded Yangjiang and landed at the same location, but they were again unsuccessful. On the 31st, Japanese warships turned to Daobai for harassment, and in the direction of Qinzhou, Lianzhou, and Fangcheng, Japanese warships also moved at the same time and sent aircraft to bomb extensively. However, the results were not officially landed. These actions are probably to test the strength of the Chinese garrison. Since then, the Japanese warships in Yangjiang and Daobai have gradually retreated, while the Japanese warships and aircraft have gathered in Zhuozhou Island (outside Beihai Port). Japanese warships have been patrolling the sea near Beihai, and Japanese aircraft have been taking off several times a day to bomb Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. On the 4th of this month, Japanese aircraft divided into four groups and attacked Guangdong and Guizhou provinces for reconnaissance and bombing. At 8:00 AM, the first group of nine aircraft attacked Yangjiang, dropped nine bombs on the county seat, and then flew away. The third group of one aircraft flew over Hepu and invaded Guizhou Province to reconnoiter Guixian, Xiangxian, Rongxian, Yulin, and Bobai. The third group of thirteen aircraft flew straight from Haikou to Xuwen at 11:00 AM and divided into two teams. One team of six aircraft peeped at Lianjiang and Hepu, and one team of seventeen aircraft invaded Guangxi and bombed Liuzhou extensively, dropping dozens of bombs. The fourth group of two aircraft reconnoitered in the airspace of Beihai. On the 5th, Japanese aircraft again divided into three groups and invaded the interior of Guangdong and Guangxi. The first group of ten aircraft dropped more than ten bombs in Duoan. The second group of seven aircraft dropped bombs in Aikou and Mosha. The third group of four aircraft took off from Qisha Seaport and dropped three bombs in Maoling Market, Qinxian County. On the 6th, Japanese aircraft became more active. From morning to dusk, southern Guangdong and southwestern Guangxi were threatened by Japanese aircraft all day long. Japanese aircraft harassed Qinxian, Nanning, Wuming, Deguo, Longan, Longmen, Lingshan, Guixian, Fangcheng, Xuwen, Lianjiang, Guiping, Wu, Liuzhou, Yongfu, and Guilin. Longan and Guilin were the main bombing targets. Dozens of bombs were dropped in Longan City, including many incendiary bombs, causing a major fire that destroyed dozens of houses. Forty bombs were dropped in Guilin, but because it was outside the city, there was no significant loss. On the 7th, 8th, 9th and 3rd, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs and fired shots at Qisha, Wulei, Longmen, Fangcheng, Aikou, Nanguan, Ningming, San Niang Bay, Rhinoceros Foot, Shakou, Nanning, and Duoan all day long, with Aikou being the most severely affected. On the 10th, the range of Japanese aircraft activity was even greater, and the targets were all in Guizhou Province. Jisi, Ningming, Pingxiang, Naqin, Mingjiang, Yongchun, Binyang, Qianjiang, Duoan, and Wuming counties were reconnoitered or bombed. On the 11th, the targets were concentrated on the coast of southern Guangdong. The two places of Daobai and Maoming suffered indiscriminate bombing. On the 13th and 14th, the activities of Japanese aircraft seemed to slow down again. On the morning of the 15th, the war broke out in Qinzhou Bay.

The purpose of the Japanese army's invasion of southern Guangdong this time is obviously to invade Guangxi. The mountains and ridges overlap in southern Guangdong, protruding overseas, and the land is poor and the people are poor. There is no military necessity or economic value. Moreover, the transportation in southern Guangdong is difficult, and all highways have been thoroughly destroyed. It is very difficult for the Japanese army to invade, but in Guizhou Province, Nanning is closer to southern Guangdong. The Japanese army plans to occupy this place, probably to use it as a stronghold and send aircraft to spy on western Hunan and Yunnan, and disrupt the Southwest base of the Chinese military. Therefore, the Japanese army's invasion of southern Guangdong this time at the risk cannot be regarded as a feint attack or harassment. It can be seen from the fact that the Japanese army landed not in Beihai but in Longmen that one of its intentions is to use it as a base. Beihai is the only large port in Guangdong. Since Guangzhou and Shantou successively fell, it has become the only transportation hub for foreign trade in South China. Its economic position is extremely important. However, Beihai is located on the coast, and the ground protrudes, which is conducive to the Japanese's encirclement. In addition, Zhuozhou Island, which faces Beihai across the sea, has long been occupied by the Japanese army. Since the door has been opened, it should be as easy as turning one's hand for the Japanese army to occupy this place. However, the Japanese army did not land in Beihai to attack Beihai, but in Longmen, east of Qisha, northwest of Beihai. Longmen is a very unknown coastal small place, but it is very close to Qinxian County and has a highway directly to Nanning, which is one of the central points on the transportation artery between Beihai and Nanning. Therefore, the Japanese army's occupation of this place is obviously intended to attack Nanning directly. However, Guizhou's anti-Japanese strength is very strong. The transportation in southern Guangdong is blocked, which is not suitable for the activities of the Japanese army's mechanized units. Moreover, the mountains and ridges overlap, which is easy to ambush. Moreover, the Japanese army's decision to attack Longmen this time is only based on the navy as the main force. The army is not only very small, but also mostly Northeast puppet troops. If they want to drive straight in, there will definitely be huge sacrifices.

As of today (17th), the only war news from Hong Kong about Beihai is that, in addition to the fact that Longmen has indeed fallen, Beihai is still in the hands of a Chinese army. As for Qisha, the situation is unknown. I guess it may also have fallen, because Qisha is closer to Nanning than Beihai. From a military point of view, the Japanese army should step up the attack and occupation. (17th)

### The Japanese Army in Huai, Si, and Shu Counties, Frustrated Coordinated Operations, the Chinese Army Closes in on Siyang City

Five or six hundred Japanese troops with eight artillery pieces from the three counties of Huai, Si, and Shu in northern Jiangsu Province attacked the Chinese army's defense in Siyang from Qijia Ferry on the 7th. They were attacked by the × battalion of the ×× regiment of the Chinese army in Qianzhuangxu, killing several Japanese troops. On the 8th at noon, the Japanese troops rampaged in Wangji in separate ways, one towards Shuqiang and one towards Zhuangtan. The Japanese troops who attacked Zhuangtan were attacked by the × battalion of the Chinese army and fled in embarrassment across the water. The Japanese troops who attacked Shuqiang were attacked by the × battalion of the Chinese army and captured three rifles and several donkeys. After setting fire to civilian houses in Shuqiang, the Japanese army fled south in panic. On the morning of the 9th, they were intercepted by the × battalion of the Chinese army and killed more than 40 Japanese troops, captured four rifles and two war horses, and shot down many livestock vehicles. The Chinese army also suffered slight casualties. The Japanese army then continued to flee south. At Chenyikou, they were surrounded by the ×× unit of the Chinese army. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army desperately broke through and fled across the water by dusk.

According to another report, the ×× brigade of the Chinese army in Siyang attacked Sicheng yesterday and had approached the city moat. Because the Japanese artillery fire was too fierce, they could not break in and retreated. The Aihucun, a pro-Japanese and puppet organization in Zhuangshixu, east of the city, was burned down by the Chinese army, and several traitors were captured. The Japanese army in Siyang City attacked Taowu on the morning of the 9th. The Chinese standing × brigade met the attack. After about half an hour of fighting, the Japanese army retreated. The Chinese army immediately pursued. The Japanese army relied on the fortifications of their stronghold and fiercely counterattacked with machine guns and artillery. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese army killed several Japanese troops. The Japanese army could not hold on and collapsed and retreated.

### After Dinghai Fell, the Opium War's Giant Guns Were Dismantled and Taken Away by the Japanese Army

Dinghai Correspondence - According to local news, during the Opium War in the 20th year of Daoguang, the British fleet attacked Guangzhou without success and changed to attack the Zhejiang Sea. At that time, the Qing court, according to Lin Zexu's presentation, advocated defending Zhejiang and built dozens of fortresses at various strategic locations in Dinghai County, Zhoushan Islands, Zhejiang, such as three miles west of the county seat and Donggangpu east of the city, to defend them and stationed heavy troops, which repeatedly played a significant role. Since the Republic of China, because there has been no foreign aggression, they have been in disrepair for many years and severely rusted. However, they are still a historical site. After the fall of Dinghai County, the Japanese army searched for scrap copper and iron everywhere. The Matsuo Unit of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in the city sent more than one hundred engineers to dismantle the thirteen giant guns of the historical site "Dingyuan", etc., and transported them back to their country by warship one after another.

Chinese Union Advances Like a Bamboo Splitting

Three minutes into the match, Chinese Union adopted an offensive defense. Zheng Wenzhi unexpectedly broke through, dribbling around to the side of the goal. Xuan Di, seeing the danger, slid into a corner kick. Chengtao took the kick, landing five yards from the goal corner. Zou Wenzhi back-heeled the ball into the net, 1-0. At eight minutes, Feng Jingxiang advanced on the right wing. Li Huitang cleverly dodged Williamson and Shi Han, shooting fiercely into the net, 2-0. At twenty-two minutes, Western Union was still at a loss. Feng Jingxiang dribbled past Williamson, and Huitang shot diagonally, falling into the left corner of the goal from the crossbar, clear and beautiful, 3-0. At thirty minutes, the battle gradually became quieter. Fula threw in a ball from the sideline, Dagu Shannu passed it skillfully to He Xi, who swept it in with force, pulling back one goal, making it 1-3. With one minute left before the break, Xu Jingcheng passed to Chengtao, who advanced rapidly along the edge, entering the goal corner. Robinson tackled Chengtao, and the ball bounced to Zou Wenzhi, who gently pushed it, and the ball went into the net, 4-1, ending the first half.

Western Union's Counterattack Fails

After the restart, Huitang, Wenzhi, and Chengtao were all injured in the battle, and the Chinese Union's front line collapsed. Western Union seized the opportunity to counterattack fiercely. Zhang Rongcai made countless saves. At twenty minutes, Chinese Union was besieged even more urgently. Fula made a low pass from the right, and Dagu Shannu scored with a diagonal shot, making it 2-4. At thirty-five minutes, Fula shot from the crowd and scored again, making it 3-4, only one goal behind. Seeing the urgency of the situation, Chinese Union launched a large-scale counterattack. Feng Shentui intercepted Huo Ban's ball in the defense, dribbled and broke through the encirclement, passing it far to Chengtao, who sprinted with illness, passing it skillfully to the center. Shuiyi arrived in time, sweeping it into the net without waiting for the ball to stop. With only half a minute left until the end, the victory belonged to the national army with a score of 5-3.

### Increased Rent for Racecourse Football Field: Western Association Appeals Again; Chinese Teams Do Not Enjoy Rights and Need Not Contribute

The three football fields within the racecourse have historically been rented by the Shanghai Western Football Association. When the racecourse increased the rent to 1,800 yuan last year, the Western Union Association appealed to all teams, requesting voluntary donations to make up for the over-budget expenses. This year, the racecourse increased the rent again by 20%, bringing the rent to 2,160 yuan. Therefore, the Western Union Association issued another notice to all member teams the day before yesterday, making another appeal, adopting the same method as last year, asking each A-team and reserve team to voluntarily donate 100 yuan, and each B and C team to donate between 25 and 50 yuan. However, Chinese teams have never enjoyed the right to play football in the racecourse and therefore do not need to contribute.

### Talking about New Combat Techniques

— Zha Rui Long

It has been nearly ten years since I started studying new combat techniques. I firmly believe that new combat techniques are the most suitable martial art for the modern Chinese nation to practice. Therefore, I am not only confident in my self-study, but also want to promote new combat techniques as my own responsibility. I am willing to reveal the insights from my research and contribute them to those who are interested in physical education.

It should be stated first that new combat techniques are different from Western boxing. New combat techniques are also different from various old-style boxing techniques in Chinese martial arts. To put it simply, new combat techniques are improved and practical boxing techniques.

Speaking of Western boxing, it is attached to commercial purposes and is limited by a special set of rules. If you were to fight someone for real, if the opponent used a foot to kick hard, you would undoubtedly lose. This is the shortcoming of it not being "applicable enough."

As for Chinese boxing techniques, there are many schools and various methods. Although the movements and postures are very good, they are too idealistic and cannot meet the needs of practical application. Furthermore, they are easy to learn but difficult to master. For example, if you are learning to drive a motorcycle, even if the instructor explains it for a month or a year, the learner will definitely not find it as easy as you imagined once they actually drive it. Therefore, practitioners of boxing techniques must integrate their usual practice with defeating the enemy in battle. How to practice is how to apply it. There should be no drawbacks of practicing in one way and then moving in another way when actually doing it. Only then can it be considered just right.

New combat techniques are indeed new combat techniques. They can use both hands and feet. How you practice is how you implement it. It is a "say what you do" and "theory and practice are the same" martial art. It is indeed a new combat technique that strengthens the body and subdues the enemy in modern times. I will list its most prominent advantages below:

(I) The practice method is very simple. Once guided, it is easy to get on the right track.

(II) When practicing or competing, wearing hand gloves and abdominal bands eliminates the risk of losing control.

(III) When fighting, you can concentrate on attacking and striking fiercely, without having to worry about what kind of boxing technique the opponent is using. You can apply it anytime, anywhere.

(IV) After practicing, various parts of the body can develop evenly, without the disadvantage of abnormal development. This is just a brief explanation. As for the detailed content, my book on new combat techniques, which is already written and about to be published, contains detailed and practical theories and guidance.

In various parts of Southeast Asia, there are no fewer than a hundred comrades who have studied new combat techniques with me. Experience tells me that it is indeed surprisingly effective. I dare not keep it secret and sincerely present this new perspective on new combat techniques to my colleagues in the field of physical education. At the same time, I respectfully await the strict criticism and practical guidance of the advanced ones.

### Grain: Rice Market Manipulators are Insatiable; 28,000 Bags of New Foreign Rice Arrive

The rice market still reports that sources from various routes are suddenly scarce. Only about twenty vehicles of goods from Su Tongkun and Tai have arrived in port. However, goods from Hexia, which have long been out of stock, suddenly arrived yesterday with eight ships from the Nangang gang. There is also a rumor that there are obstructions in Fengqing and other areas that prevent them from being transported to Shanghai. For a time, people were whispering and asking each other. Sellers wanted to wait for a good opportunity and were unwilling to let go easily. Samples were rarely displayed. Yesterday morning, the inland gangs and local shops were generally solid customers and active. 客販 were also very welcome, because the way out for solid customers was to sell goods quickly, and they were cash transactions, not subject to the delay and stagnation of speculators and hoarders, so they were willing to accommodate, and the price was only raised by two or three cents. Unexpectedly, a group of speculators considered it to be the effectiveness of rumors and secretly celebrated their success, thinking that the time to manipulate the market had arrived. So they made a big move, colluding with hoarders, on the one hand, they frantically raised the price of the profitable goods and threw them out, and on the other hand, they searched for cheaper goods everywhere and lowered the price to pull them in. The 客販 also mistakenly believed it was a good opportunity and were unwilling to let go, so they all shouted wildly. Ruochang glutinous rice even broke through the 41-42 yuan mark. As a result, it went beyond the right track, but it was easy to distinguish the real from the false, and it was difficult to achieve the facts. Furthermore, there was already a lot of stock in the Shanghai warehouses, and although the price of foreign rice was difficult to match the market price and sales were stopped, the number that had been already agreed upon was huge. In addition to those that had already arrived in port, there were still more on the way. The mentality of the average solid customer was not like that of the speculators who were only seeking profit and taking risks. They always held a steady approach, advancing if they could, otherwise willing to stand by. Now that the market was mixed again and the prices were inaccurate, they felt thorny, so they all changed course and watched without advancing. The sales floor suddenly became sluggish. At the same time, the huge amount of foreign rice held by the Northern Ocean Gang continued to be thrown out. Seeing that the market had lost its momentum, they immediately loosened their sales of Saigon, which had risen from 35.5 yuan in the morning, to 34.5 yuan. The speculators, in this environment, were brutally hit on the head by the foreign rice, and the stagnation of the solid customers made them feel that they had lost their effect and could not manipulate the market. They had to hang their heads in dejection. By the close of the market, everything was flat and there was no revitalization. As a result, the closing price, although weary from the earlier wild surge, was still half a yuan to one yuan higher than the previous market price, regardless of the glutinous rice or pointed rice. The total volume of transactions in the unified market was nearly 10,000 bags.

客秈 arrivals yesterday were continuously reported. More than 6,000 bags arrived before and after. The sellers were optimistic and did not display samples, and the price of foreign rice was reported to have increased, which made people even more optimistic. In addition, the 客囤 were very greedy, and speculation was particularly active, so the price suddenly soared by more than one yuan. The market turned silent with actual sales, and more floating and profit-taking 客囤 returned to sell, so the market began to soften, but high-quality 客秈 still required 34.5 yuan. Nearly 3,000 bags were traded.

Foreign rice telegraphs increased by one or two yuan yesterday. All previous negotiations have been abandoned. The market atmosphere suddenly became tense. Although there were continued arrivals from Hong Kong, the price was shouted up again by one yuan. Annamese glutinous rice was 35 yuan and 34.5 yuan, Saigon was 34 yuan and 33.5 yuan. More than 2,000 bags were opened all day.

A large batch of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, Taihe Company and Jiaying Transport transported 13,657 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. They are currently unloading. Furthermore, the Suzhou wheel entered the port in the evening, also transporting a large batch of 14,535 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The holds will be opened and unloaded today. The two wheels transported a total of 28,192 bags of foreign rice.

### Wheat Sets a Record - Selling at Twelve Yuan

The flour market is quite tight. The northbound and southbound gangs of customers are consistently reporting that business is continuous. The local shops are also seeing continued greed. The cause is that in the rising tide of commodity prices, the price of rice is close to 40 yuan and the price of wheat has reached 12 yuan. Therefore, people are looking upward and hoarding goods. The recycled goods in the market are rarely released. Paoche flour is already selling for 7.6 yuan, and the factories are still holding on, unwilling to sell more. The total volume of transactions in the unified market is more than 50,000 bags. It is rumored that there are also a small number of by-product flours being sold. The price of Hong Liu Hai brand is 5.3-4 yuan, and the price of the Japanese Phoenix brand flour has also risen to more than 7 yuan.

The trend of the wheat market continues to grow and increase, rising sharply. The reason is that the price of inland production has been driven up by the price of rice, and the sources are becoming even more scarce. The sellers' intentions are becoming stronger. The highest price of wheat must be sold at 12 yuan. Yesterday, it set a record. The market and warehouses were absorbing it greatly. The factories also had to release the price to take over the business. The total volume of factory business in the unified market was 18,000 bags. There were fifteen or sixteen vehicles of warehouse delivery, and the price was decided from 12 yuan to 11.56 yuan. The market still has a rising trend.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans from South China are Actively Procured, Market Price Continues to Rise by Five or Six Cents; Sesame is Also Good, Rising by More Than One Yuan

Soybeans: In the state of tense sentiment in the market, the gangs from South China were aroused to procure goods, causing the warehouses and shops on the street to become even more excited. Under the vigorous lifting by all parties, the market price continued to rise by five or six cents. 1,600-1,700 bags of Wuhu beans were traded. The price is detailed in the market price column. 1,400 bags of Anqing beans, 600 bags of Nanjing beans, 450 bags of Dingjiazhou beans, 300 bags of Jiangbei beans, and 500 bags of Chongming sand yellow.

Sesame: Although there were no inquiries from foreign firms for actual sales yesterday, the general mentality of doing business was lively. The market price has risen by more than one yuan compared to the tired time. 200 bags of Yangzhou sesame were opened, and the price was 27.2 yuan. 200 bags of Wuhu sesame, and the price was 28.5 yuan. 150 bags of Hankou sesame, and the price was 29 yuan.

Beans: 3,460 bags were exported to Hong Kong today, and 50 bags were transported to Haikou. Another 3,470 bags and 115 bags of raw peanuts were transported to Singapore, and 1,530 bags of raw peanuts were transported to Hong Kong.

### Oil Cake: Connected to Soybean Oil, 90 Yuan Mark, Road Goods Side-by-Side with Spot Market

Soybean oil: Because the general players are stirring up trouble, the chips on the market are being drawn tighter and tighter, people's minds are firmly bullish, and the market price is jumping horizontally. Yesterday, the price of Dalian oil in the market broke through the 90 yuan mark, having opened up to 93.5 yuan, but only ten barrels were traded. Qingdao oil was 192 yuan, with 40 barrels traded. Local factory oil was 74 yuan, with 100担 traded. Yinqi oil was 69 yuan, opened 300 pieces. Qingqi oil was 68 yuan, 50 pieces. Jiaozhou oil was 67 yuan, 100 pieces. The price of road goods has been shoulder-to-shoulder with the spot oil.

The rising wind of raw oil has slowed down slightly. The Jiaozhou oil was handled by the local warehouse gangs, the original price was 70 yuan, 100 pieces. The Hong Kong gang took 500 cans of Yantai hearing oil, the price was 92 yuan.

4,255 cans of raw oil and 600 cans of sesame oil were transported to Hong Kong on the 29th.

### Finance Following Five Days of Continuous Gains, Gold Market Experienced a Minor Correction Yesterday

Yesterday, the spot gold market's trading was active in the morning, continuing the bullish trend of the past few days. Furthermore, the exchange rate market reported a contraction, coupled with aggressive price increases by certain gold firms, leading to a peak price of 3,935 yuan at the opening. However, news soon emerged of tightened exchange rates in Tianjin, and a bullion dealer from the Tianjin group began buying. Unfortunately, the exchange rate market suddenly loosened, and securities firms sold off large quantities. Cash gold firms and jewelry shops also sold into the market, making it difficult to maintain the original position. The price once fell to a low of 3,860 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms re-entered the market after making profits, and by the noon closing, the price had recovered by ten yuan, reaching 3,870 yuan. In the afternoon, due to further softening of the exchange rate market, the opening price rose by twenty yuan, and soon after, it increased by another five yuan. At that time, securities firms turned to buying, and bullion dealers also rushed in. However, unexpectedly, a certain bullion dealer suddenly started selling, and others, such as securities firms, repeatedly sold off, causing the price to plummet to 3,861 yuan. Although a certain gold firm bought in some, raising the price by over ten yuan, the final result was only 2,870 yuan, a decrease of ten yuan compared to the previous day. Trading remained brisk, with an estimated volume of around 2,000 taels. Jewelry gold was marked down by five yuan, while customs gold remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Price Decreased by Ten Yuan

This morning, each bar (ten taels) initially continued the bullish momentum of the previous few days, and the foreign exchange market opened weak. Those shouting to buy were momentarily tense. A certain gold firm was particularly aggressive. Until the market opened at 9:30 AM, the price was raised by 55 yuan. A certain gold firm bought 20 taels from securities firms at 3,935 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the opening, cash gold firms sold at the higher price, and the exchange rate market stopped tightening and started to strengthen. A certain firm's buying appetite diminished, and the price immediately fell back by 30 yuan. The same firm sold 10 taels to a certain bullion dealer for 3,905 yuan. At that time, a certain bullion dealer continued to absorb, increasing the price by 15 yuan. A certain bullion dealer bought 10 taels from jewelry shops for 3,920 yuan. Subsequently, bullish securities firms began selling, and cash gold firms continued to sell, causing a further decrease of 25 yuan. Securities firms sold 50 taels to bullion dealers for 3,895 yuan. Later, due to renewed buying interest from a certain gold firm and follow-up buying from retail investors, the price rose again to 3,920 yuan. Soon after, as the exchange rate market continued to stabilize, securities firms and bullion dealers rushed to sell, and jewelry shops also frequently came to hedge. Moreover, the buying appetite weakened, and the price plummeted by 60 yuan. A bullion dealer sold 20 taels to a certain jewelry shop for 3,860 yuan. Approaching noon, the foreign exchange market turned stable, and securities firms slightly recovered profits and re-entered the market, raising the price by 22 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels from a gold firm for 3,881 yuan. Later, a certain bullion dealer reversed and sold on behalf of floating accounts, decreasing the price by 12 yuan. Jewelry shops sold 10 taels to cash gold firms for 3,870 yuan as the noon closing price. The market initially opened in the afternoon, because the exchange rate market was reported weak, and securities firms and bullion dealers competed to release orders and absorb. The opening price was raised by 20 yuan. Securities firms bought 10 taels from jewelry shops for 3,890 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm and a certain bullion dealer came to sell, immediately decreasing the price by 10 yuan. Bullion dealers sold 20 taels to securities firms for 3,880 yuan. At that time, securities firms continued to raise the price, and sellers were scarce, further raising the price by 15 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels from a certain gold firm for 3,895 yuan. After entering, bullish bullion dealers once again sold, and securities firms also came to sell. Furthermore, the foreign exchange market had stopped tightening and turned stable. The buying appetite was unusually weak, and soon the price plummeted by 34 yuan. Bullion dealers sold 30 taels to a certain gold firm for 3,861 yuan. Later, a certain firm supplemented its position after making profits, recovering 17 yuan. A certain gold firm bought 20 taels from a bullion dealer for 3,878 yuan. Near the closing time, a certain bullion dealer sold dozens of taels, further decreasing the price by 8 yuan. Bullion dealers mutually traded 20 taels for 3,870 yuan as the evening closing price. The result was a decrease of ten yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 75 yuan throughout the day. The gold owned by cash gold firms was sold at a price ten yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the purchased gold was reduced by more than twenty yuan. The current margin gold price is about fifty to sixty yuan lower than the listed gold price, but transactions are scarce.

Jewelry Gold Marked Down by Five Yuan

Jewelry gold per tael was initially offered by Da Tong firms at 395 yuan. By noon, it was marked down by five yuan, and there were no further changes. In the end, Da Tong firms revised the price to 390 yuan. The prices were the same at Xin Tong firms, and the purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Exchange Market Quiet

The foreign exchange market was quiet yesterday. HSBC's listed prices did not change. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies did not fluctuate as much as in the previous two days, and the underlying trend had stabilized slightly, but people still felt uneasy. In the initial market, the Jewish speculator George Chih-fu began buying, causing a slight tightening after the opening. Later, due to Hong Kong Electric's willingness to sell, speculators did not lack selling. Although Sassoon and Jardine Matheson absorbed, supply exceeded demand, and the market turned weaker. At that time, the British pound was quoted at 4 shillings 8.4375 pence, and the US dollar reached 7.90625 yuan. Subsequently, Jardine Matheson's buying appetite became stronger, and by the noon closing, the market had slightly tightened, to 4 shillings 8.28125 pence and 7.875 yuan. The market trend softened again in the afternoon. Jardine Matheson continued to buy, and since trading was quiet, there was a feeling of a lack of positions. The British pound tightened again to 4 shillings 7.8125 pence, and the US dollar again appeared at 7.8125 yuan. In the end, some bullion dealers sold some, and the market turned stable. Until the close of trading, there was no change. The closing prices were 4 shillings 8.125 pence and 7.84375 yuan, compared to the previous day, the British pound did not move, while the US dollar decreased by 0.03125 yuan, due to the continued decline of the US-British exchange rate by 0.075 yuan. The futures market was similar to the spot market.

George Chih-fu First Concluded Buying

In the early morning, the London long-term rate was stable, the New York silver price was still stable, and the London raw gold price was fixed. Exchange rates for British currency against US currency and against French currency were stable, and against Shanghai currency contracted by 0.00125. US currency against British currency decreased by 0.075, against Shanghai currency fell by 0.15 yuan, and against French currency decreased by a little. The central listed prices for various currencies were like those for fen. The opening prices for cash sales at banks in the morning were British currency at 4 shillings 7.78125 pence and US currency at 7.78125 yuan. Compared to the previous day, US currency was tighter than British currency, by 0.03125 for British currency and 0.09375 for US currency, which was due to the decline in exchange rates. After the opening, the Jewish merchant George Chih-fu first came to buy, paying Hua Bi bank cash price of 4 shillings 7.75 pence for British currency. At that time, the US currency also softened to 7.75 yuan. Soon, Chinese merchants came to sell foreign bank cash US currency at 7.8125 yuan, and the situation slightly stabilized. HSBC's listed exchange rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver equilibrium tax was also announced as unchanged. After that, Hong Kong banks did not sell, and Chinese merchants continued to sell. Although Jardine Matheson and Ewo took the opportunity to absorb, the positions still felt abundant, so the market continued to stabilize. It is estimated that Hong Kong banks and the American bank Chase sold cash US currency to Jardine Matheson and Sassoon for 7.875 and 7.90625 yuan. Then, Hong Kong banks and Chinese merchants sold cash British currency to foreign banks like Sassoon and Ewo for 4 shillings 8.125 pence and 8.4375 pence. Approaching noon, Ewo's buying appetite strengthened, so the situation slightly improved. Until the noon closing, the cash sales prices at banks were British currency at 4 shillings 8.28125 pence and US currency at 7.875 yuan, compared to the morning opening, British currency increased by 0.046875 and US currency strengthened by 0.09375.

Closing Price for British Currency Stable, US Currency Slightly Tighter

In the initial market of the afternoon, sellers were quite scarce, and Ewo still had buying appetite, so the market slightly softened. British currency fell to 4 shillings 7.78125 pence, and US currency described as 7.8125 yuan. Later, a bullion dealer came to sell US currency bills to Chase bank for 7.875 yuan. Until the evening closing, the cash sales prices at banks were British currency at 4 shillings 8.125 pence and US currency at 7.84375 yuan. The twelve-month British currency was 4 shillings 7.75 pence and US currency was 7.71875 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, both the current and future British currency had no difference, while US currency was slightly tighter by 0.03125 yuan.

Hong Kong Spot US Dollar Exchange Rate Decreased

A telegram from Hong Kong on the 28th reported that the exchange market opened stable this morning. Both current and future British currency were unchanged. Spot US currency was tighter by 0.0625, at 14.375 yuan. Spot Shanghai currency decreased by 2 yuan, to 308 yuan. Spot Japanese currency was tighter by 0.25, at 104 yuan. At 9:45 AM, spot Shanghai currency rose again by 2 yuan, still at 310 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it was stable and unchanged. At noon closing, spot Shanghai currency decreased again by 2 yuan, to 308 yuan. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the market opened stable. Spot Shanghai currency decreased again by 1 yuan, to 307 yuan.

Tianjin Shanghai Currency Decreased by 1.5 Yuan

"Joint Notes" on the black market were cheaper by 1 yuan, at 89 yuan.

### Gold Pounds and Gold Bills Decreased

Yesterday, the demand for foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, decreased, and the market loosened. The market price for British and American gold bills weakened. American gold bills were initially strong, once rising to 12.9 yuan. Subsequently, customers supplied enthusiastically, and the market price frequently softened, decreasing to 12.5 yuan in the evening market. Demand for French franc bills was strong, and the market price was firm. The market price for Japanese gold bills was 1.2555 yuan. Korean bills were also weak, with an evening market price of 1.135 yuan. Yesterday's market prices were British and American gold pounds both decreased by 0.5 yuan, British gold bills decreased by 0.2 yuan, American gold bills decreased by 0.05 yuan, French franc bills increased by 0.0008 yuan, and other currencies did not change.

### Securities Internal Debt Showing Mixed Gains and Losses

The securities black market was listless and sluggish yesterday. The excitement of the previous day subsided, and people returned to uncertainty. A group of retail investors who had been following the trend turned from bullish to bearish because the market price had first risen and then fallen the previous day. Yesterday, when the opening price showed limited losses, they rushed to cover their positions. As a result, Class C bonds re-emerged above the 7 yuan mark after initially falling below it. The market price relied on this to hold up. However, this kind of floating short covering, driven by following the trend, was not formal buying to increase positions, so the foundation was still floating and insubstantial. Yesterday morning, the opening price was relatively low. Class C bonds opened below 7 yuan, and then, due to floating short covering, re-emerged above 7 yuan. It was observed that the price had already fluctuated many times around the 7 yuan mark, and further changes were still to come. The market was initially firm and then tired in the afternoon, with only slight fluctuations. Covering transactions only slightly embellished the market. As a result, the number of gains and losses offset each other, and the number was not more than 0.05 or 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 500,000. A summary table is listed below.

In stock trading, a small number of shares of the Commercial Press were traded, with a price of 67.75 yuan.

The underlying trend of the stock market at the Public Industry Association yesterday was strong. Public interest was less than in previous days. Rubber stocks were also firm, although trading was sparse. There were still many inquiries about various stocks.

The managers of the Kiao Lao Fo and Ying Gu Da Chu Rubber Limited Companies, both managed by the Shanghai Hui Tong Foreign Firm, have been resolved by the board of directors of each company to pay the first interim dividend for 1939 on December 12. Kiao Lao Fo will continue to pay 0.05 yuan per share (together with the first household payment of 0.05 yuan, a total of 0.1 yuan has been paid). Ying Gu Da Chu will continue to pay 0.2 yuan per share (together with the first payment of 0.2 yuan, a total of 0.4 yuan has been paid).

The fourteenth lottery for the Shanghai Disaster Area Reconstruction Public Bonds of the Republic of China, 21st Year, will be held at the HSBC Bank at 12 The Bund, Shanghai, at 4:00 PM on December 6. The number of branches to be drawn this time is two, each with a principal of 60,000 yuan, for a total principal repayment of 120,000 yuan. Together with the matured interest coupons for the fourteenth period, they will be paid by the Shanghai HSBC Bank on December 15.

### Yarn and Cotton Raw Yarn Transactions Not Weak

The yarn market, which had risen sharply the previous day, returned to a quiet path yesterday. The actual cause was the slight stability of the foreign exchange market. At the same time, the rising wind in the overseas Bombay cotton market had stopped, but US cotton was still firm. People's hearts were peaceful, not as heated as the previous day. The upward force seemed to be hindered by the restraint of the small good shadow. However, Hong Kong banks still converted to Hong Kong currency to rise, and the absorption of raw yarn was still healthy, but demand for fine yarn was quiet. The vitality of the eastern Zhejiang area was not as good as in the past, so the yarn market was unable to continue to advance. However, raw cotton was still firm and expensive.

The current yarn farm opening and industry popularity were still good, but traders' intentions were not strong. The price for 20-count Double Horse was 680 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. Unexpectedly, once the price was high, many profit-takers took the opportunity to sell, and the market suddenly loosened. At the same time, the opening of foreign exchange showed no major changes, and the price fell to 671 yuan. Subsequently, due to the still-not-weak transactions of raw yarn by customers, the price recovered a few yuan. It was found that 1,455 bales were traded in half a day. The market price for 20-count Double Horse fell by 3 yuan, Double Globe fell by 3 yuan, and Heavenly Lady fell by 2 yuan. Shenxin No. 2 Factory opened 700 bales of 20-count Heavenly Lady at a price of 670 yuan. Shenxin No. 9 Factory opened 500 bales of 10-count Red Double Horse at a price of 500 yuan, supplementing the previous price of 580 yuan, and clearing the previous idle 580 yuan yarn on the same day. Today, 91 pieces of yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 75 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 5 pieces were shipped to Haikou. The amounts purchased by various merchant groups are listed on the left.

### Cotton Calling Price Reaches 150 Yuan

The trading of local cotton was still not weak. Most of the transactions were done by fellow traders. Factory transactions were average. However, the inventory was not thick, so the yarn factories, although they did not buy, were as firm in their hearts as . If factory sales were to move, the increase would be unstoppable. Therefore, the common intention of traders to collect was becoming stronger. The foundation of the cotton market was more expensive than the yarn market. However, the rising wind of Indian cotton had stopped, and US cotton was also gentle. Cotton prices could still be leveled one step at a time. The calling price for Tonghua cotton was 150 yuan, and the transaction price was 149 yuan, still an increase of 1.4 yuan compared to the previous day. Taicang cotton had reached 116 yuan. The supply from northern Jiangsu was slightly stronger. It is estimated that 5,238 bales of Tonghua cotton and 2,160 bales of Beisha cotton arrived, and 160 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

Another news item: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was firm at the opening this morning. Speculators took the opportunity to buy. Cash merchants and merchants from New Orleans were all buying in the market, resulting in the highest closing price, an increase of 8.9 pounds per sound compared to the previous day's market price. Indian cotton, including forecasts, increased by more than 3 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 40 pounds per sound. Liverpool had no significant difference.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently. All parties are cautious because the exchange rate changes are unpredictable. The factory has enough inventory to cope with, and orders have been continuously loaded and shipped on the way, so they are extremely indifferent to the current problem of raw cotton procurement. The Japanese factory has also been quiet these days, with no more than a bale of transactions all day.

### Piece Goods The First Batch of Products Sold After Lun Chang Resumes Work

The sales of domestic cloth were not smooth. Fellow traders transferred and sold at a profit. Hong Kong and Nanyang merchants benefited more from procurement due to exchange rate relations, and transactions turned brisk. The futures prices quoted by the factory were all expensive, so the spot market presented a revolving labor. Hong Kong merchants purchased more than 100 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, and nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth and coarse twill. Nanyang merchants purchased more than 5,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, and printed cloth. Fellow traders and hoarders in this street traded more than 300 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, and coarse cloth, and more than 10,000 pieces of flannel, colored cloth, and printed goods. After the resumption of work at the British Lun Chang factory, the first batch of products was sold yesterday, including blue cloth, printed cloth, straight tribute satin, and bleached cloth, totaling more than 50 boxes, purchased by wholesale shops in this street.

### Japanese Naval Landing Forces Actually Exercising Police Power Notifying Residents of Hongkou and Yangshupu to Report Criminal Cases to Japanese Military Units Police Department Officials Express Regret

According to the English-language Da Mei Wan Pao, the Japanese-language Continental News reported that Rear Admiral Takeda of the Shanghai-based Japanese Naval Landing Forces asked civilians in Hongkou and Yangshupu on Sunday to cooperate in preventing crime and arresting criminals in the western district. Takeda said that the key to solving crime lies in

Prompt Reporting

Residents of the western district who encounter criminal cases can report them by telephone to the Japanese Defense Forces Command and the Hongkou, Central, and Eastern District Japanese military units. Reporters learned this morning (28th) that the Public Concession Police Department had not been notified of Takeda's appeal. The Police Department believes that Takeda did not include the Police Department's telephone number in the above list,

which is regrettable.

The real key to solving crime lies in letting the Police Department conduct investigations, as this is the job of police officers, not the task of sailors. Although sailors can assist the Police Department, they are not trained in

crime investigation.

The number of police officers and control of the Police Department north of Suzhou Creek are still limited due to the Japanese occupation of the area. However, the Police Department can still solve crimes north of Suzhou Creek, as in the recent arrest of the thugs who killed a Japanese person on Tangshan Road.

### Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce Visited Kato Yesterday Focusing on Commercial Issues in the Discussion No Other Special Events Were Discussed

According to the English-language Da Mei Wan Pao, Sir [blank] Marshall, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, visited Japanese Envoy Kato at the Broadway Mansion this morning (28th) for a courtesy call. It is said that the meeting between the two began at 9:30 AM this morning and lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. Observers who are closely monitoring the trend of recent Shanghai diplomatic negotiations believe that the discussion between Sir [blank] Marshall and Kato this morning focused on various commercial issues of the British in this area. However, according to Kato's reply to reporters' questions, he said that "no special circumstances were discussed." In addition, he refused to continue to make comments. Sir [blank] Marshall also remained silent about the meeting with the Japanese envoy, only saying that "it was a friendly visit and the conversation was very ordinary."

### Empress of Canada Converted to Transport Ship

The British Changxing Steamship Company's mail ship "Empress of Canada" was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the first of next month. The Dazhong News Agency reporter learned from reliable sources in the shipping industry yesterday that the ship has been ordered by the British Admiralty to be converted into a transport ship and will not arrive in Shanghai as scheduled. The Empress of Canada weighs 21,500 tons, is 644 feet long, and is the largest mail ship of the Changxing Company.

### Judges and Lawyers Unexpectedly Threatened Terrorists Send Threatening Letters Separately Daggers Inserted in Front of Judge's Residence The Municipal Council Has Taken Strict Precautions

According to the English-language Da Mei Wan Pao, it was learned this morning (28th) that after Yu Hua, President of the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, was killed by thugs on Shanzhong Road on Thursday, terrorists have sent threatening letters to two judges of the Chinese courts in the two concessions and lawyers in the Municipal Council's legal department in recent days. The letters stated that if the recipients participated in the lawsuit when prosecuting those arrested for Yu Hua's murder, they would

lose their lives.

The Police Department has dispatched police officers to protect the two judges and the Municipal Council's lawyers. According to reliable sources, a judge of the Special First District Court of the Public Concession recently found a dagger inserted in front of his residence. The judge only reported the matter to the police station and continued to perform his duties as usual. A judge of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in the French Concession

did not appear in court yesterday. It is said that the judge also received an anonymous threatening letter, and his position was the same as Yu Hua's. If Yu Hua was assassinated for political reasons, the judge is now in similar danger. In the corridor outside the Municipal Council's legal department (Director is [blank] Briand), the authorities have added

patrol guards

and specially assigned patrol guards to protect several senior lawyers who attend the Special District Court to handle prosecution laws. Regarding the Yu Hua murder case, the Police Department has not yet arrested the perpetrators, which has not been confirmed this morning. Legal professionals pointed out that terrorists do not consider the system of prosecuting criminals in the two concessions. For example, if an assassination occurs in the French Concession, the

arrested criminals

are often sent to the Special Second District Court of the French Concession, not the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court or the Special First District Court of the Public Concession. The courts where the two judges and the Municipal Council's lawyers who received the threatening letters perform their duties have no connection with the litigation of the Special Second District Court.

### Wu Guangxin's Coffin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Temporarily Placed in the Shanghai Funeral Home

After Wu Guangxin passed away in Hong Kong at 8:40 PM on the 14th of this month, his family originally planned to temporarily place the coffin in Hong Kong and return it to his native place for burial after the situation stabilized. Later, due to many inconveniences in Hong Kong, it was decided to transport the coffin to Shanghai. It was transported to Shanghai by the Taikoo Company's Jiaying Wheel the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. This afternoon, the coffin will be transported to the Shanghai Funeral Home for temporary storage, and no ceremony will be held. Wu was 58 years old this year. In February of last year, he refused to participate in the puppet organization and went to Hong Kong, residing in Kowloon. Apart from reading books and scriptures and participating in charity work, he did not ask about world affairs. This sudden passing was mourned by all in the central government. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also sent a telegram to express condolences to his family.

### Over 48,000 Bags of Imported Rice Arrived in Four Days The Jiaying Wheel Transported Over 13,000 Bags Yesterday The Suzhou Wheel Also Transported Over 14,000 Bags

Recently, rice prices have risen again, and people are very fearful. The reason for this is that they are all confused by rumors. In fact, the source is constant. Rice stores have sufficient rice in stock, and recently foreign rice has also been coming in continuously. Not only has the price not decreased, but it has risen day by day, and will soon reach the highest peak of last month. The principles of price increases are truly unpredictable. As for the import of foreign rice, over 48,000 bags have arrived in Shanghai in four days. The Taikoo Company's Sichuan Wheel transported 20,658 bags of foreign rice on the 25th. The Jiaying Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, bringing 13,657 bags from Hong Kong. The Suzhou Wheel also imported 14,535 bags from Hong Kong yesterday evening and is currently unloading. It is said that a large batch will be transported later.

The Rice Market Increased the Number of Committee Members on Duty

Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the source of rice in Shanghai has increased recently, and the rice warehouses have increased their stock. The pile of Hong Kong tribute rice is also being loaded and shipped to Shanghai in succession. However, the rice maggots' greed has not been restrained, and they have been buying in large quantities, resulting in a situation of rising rice prices. The Concession authorities are now sending staff to the rice shops and tea houses to monitor the market every day, and are closely investigating rumor-mongering brokers. The Rice Market Management Committee is increasing the number of committee members on duty every day to maintain market order and strictly enforce (1) brokers are only allowed to sell to fellow traders in the market, (2) goods sold on behalf of customers are only allowed to be sold to rice shops that are fellow traders in the market, and (3) rice purchased by rice shops should be purchased from rice shops that are fellow traders in the market. All buying and selling in the market must be spot transactions and must not buy or sell short, in order to maintain the entire people's food supply.

The Rice Industry Observes the Trend of Rice Prices

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency went to the Rice Shop Tea House Market at [time blank] yesterday morning. At that time, people's hearts were upward and continued to be bullish. As a result, the price rose by another 0.4 or 0.5 yuan. However, according to a certain rice industry leader, judging from the current rice source situation, rice prices will fall back within days. The so-called "transportation certificates" have been negotiated. Now, rice merchants from various groups are starting to purchase separately. The goods that arrived in Shanghai yesterday were mainly indica rice. The market for japonica goods was less absorbent, but a large batch of indica goods is still on its way to Shanghai. Once it arrives at the port and enters the warehouse, people's hearts will tend downstream, and rice prices will fall without being folded.

### Various Banks Issue Auxiliary Coin Vouchers; Restrictions Placed on China Farmers' Bank 5-Jiao Vouchers; Zhejiang Bank Corner Notes Already Exchanged; Jiangsu Farmers' Old Auxiliary Coin Vouchers Being Sorted

The auxiliary coin vouchers circulating in the Shanghai market include those of 1-jiao and 2-jiao denominations from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, as well as 5-jiao, 2-jiao, and 1-jiao denominations from the Central Bank, China Farmers' Bank, Zhejiang Local Bank, and Jiangsu Farmers' Bank. The number of auxiliary coin vouchers issued by various banks one after another is quite large, sufficient for market circulation. The recent lack of market panic clearly indicates that some people are hoarding for profit. To adjust the market and meet legitimate needs, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China Farmers' Bank have agreed on temporary remedial measures, including exchanging and circulating the auxiliary coin vouchers in the inventories of various banks as much as possible, and telegraphing their head offices to rush-print new auxiliary coin vouchers and transport them to Shanghai for assistance.

Various Banks Begin Inventory Exchange

(1) The China Farmers' Bank has put forward its inventory of 5-jiao auxiliary coin vouchers for issuance. Starting yesterday, it has entrusted the Central Bank to exchange them at its Shanghai branch on Avenue Albert. Those applying for exchange were very crowded. Yesterday, a total of 50,000 yuan was exchanged. The exchange continues today, but each person is subject to restrictions. (2) The Zhejiang Local Bank has reissued its old 1-jiao and 2-jiao auxiliary coin vouchers previously collected. Approximately 100,000 yuan has already been exchanged. It will be suspended temporarily starting today. Once the old vouchers are sorted, they will be exchanged again at a fixed time.

Jiangsu Farmers' Old Vouchers Reissued

The 5-jiao, 2-jiao, and 1-jiao vouchers previously issued by the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank, including the auxiliary coin vouchers of the Xuzhou Pingshi Official Money Bureau, circulated in the Shanghai market in large quantities. During the first half of the year, when Shanghai refused to use banknotes from other places, the bank collected a large number of old auxiliary coin vouchers. Now, to adjust the market, it has decided to reissue the previously collected vouchers. All industries with legitimate needs can exchange them at its Shanghai branch at 539 Avenue Joffre, but each person is limited to 100 yuan. It is best to prepare an exchange letter separately. The exchange is scheduled to begin today.

Telegraph Head Office to Transport Assistance to Shanghai

Yesterday, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications that temporary remedial measures have been discussed regarding the shortage of auxiliary coin vouchers in Shanghai. The inventories of various banks have been exchanged as much as possible, and the head offices have been requested to print new vouchers and transport them to Shanghai for assistance. Therefore, the lack of panic has gradually been eliminated. It is hoped that citizens will not hoard in large quantities to avoid another panic. However, the circulation of auxiliary coin vouchers in Shanghai is sufficient for the legitimate needs of the market. The reason for this shortage is quite puzzling. Regarding the second batch of fractional coin vouchers, a formal announcement will be made and issued as soon as printing is completed.

### Barbed Wire on North Jiangxi Road Extended Again Yesterday; Police Had Consultations but Still Not Removed

At the gaps in the blockade line on North Jiangxi Road north of the Suzhou Creek, Japanese sentries have recently been extremely strict in checking residents entering and exiting. Yesterday morning, several Chinese people entering the central district from Hongkou were detained one after another and held in the guardhouse for a long time before being released. At the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, after Japanese soldiers slightly extended the police line outwards with barbed wire, two new barbed wire fences were set up. The relevant police authorities had negotiated with the Japanese sentries to remove one of them to facilitate traffic. Unexpectedly, two more were added again yesterday, causing considerable obstruction to the traffic on North Jiangxi Road. Also, at the Baoshan Road intersection, there was originally a Japanese guard post with two Japanese soldiers stationed there. Since its removal a few days ago, there is now only one Japanese soldier, constantly patrolling back and forth between Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road.

### Solicitation of Winter Clothing Allowances to End at the End of the Month; Donations from All Walks of Life Never Slacken; Fundraising Results Are Very Good

Shanghai's solicitation of winter clothing funds of 200,000 yuan began in October of this year, and the full amount was raised by the end of October. Subsequently, because the fundraising headquarters issued a notice to fundraising organizations across the country to extend the period by one month, it also continued to fundraise for one month. Donations from all walks of life never slackened, and the results were very good. It is learned that it has been decided to end the process on schedule at the end of this month, and remit the funds to the fundraising headquarters to make winter clothing for the soldiers.

### Inland Postmen's Allowances Generally Increased; Divided into Two Types, Four Yuan and Eight Yuan; Depending on the Location of the Service Bureau

The reason for the postal workers' strike last month was that the allowance for postal clerks was increased to ten yuan, while the allowance for postal porters remained at seven and a half yuan. In order to seek equal treatment, they once went on strike to fight for it.

Generally Increase

Now the Postal Administration has approved the recommendation of the Shanghai Postal Director. In addition to supplementing the allowances of postmen, etc., to 10 yuan per month, starting in November, the allowances for all postal employees in the Shanghai Post Office, regardless of rank, have been generally increased to 15 yuan, and are not limited to postal porters.

Inland Messengers

As for the allowances for inland postal porters in the Shanghai postal district, which were previously only 2 yuan, they have also been increased to 4 yuan and 8 yuan after the Postal Director made a recommendation to the General Post Office. The standard for increasing the allowances to 4 yuan or 8 yuan is based on the cost of living in the area where the service bureau is located.

Begin Supplementary Issuance

The above measures have been ordered by the Postal Director to the accounting department of the post office for implementation. It is noted that today is the day for the post office to pay salaries, and the procedures for the above supplementary allowances have been started and generally implemented.

### Tang-Character Tugs, Released, Placed Under Receivership; Flies Japanese Flag; Former Crew Members All Expelled; American Company to Take Necessary Action

The four Portuguese tugs, Tang Sai, Tang Qiao, Tang Lu, and Tang Bei, were represented by the American-owned Wah Mei Navigation Company after the "August 13th" battle due to mortgage relations, and operated on the Shanghai-Wenzhou-Taizhou-Ningbo lines. In April of this year, the Tang Qiao, Tang Lu, and Tang Bei were detained by the Japanese Navy one after another. Unexpectedly, the Portuguese man Ying Kang Sheng (transliteration) and two Japanese men suddenly went to the tugs the day before yesterday afternoon and changed the flags on the sterns of each ship to Japanese flags. This shows that the tugs have undoubtedly cooperated with the Japanese side.

Former Crew Members Expelled

During the detention period of the Tang-character tugs, Wah Mei Navigation Company assigned crew members to guard the tugs and be responsible for watching the tugs. After the tugs were released, the crew members remained on board and did not leave. The day before yesterday afternoon, in addition to affixing Japanese flags to each tug, the other party brought many new crew members and ordered them to be stationed, seemingly taking over. On the one hand, the old crew members were expelled from the tugs, and it was declared that if the old crew members wanted to continue working, they would have to pay a deposit to the new company: 700 to 800 yuan for the accounting room, 400 to 500 yuan for the teahouse, and other departments such as sailors and firemen would have to be re-selected, otherwise they would not be allowed to work.

Wah Mei Company Cannot Remain Silent

A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned reliable information from the shipping industry that the truth about the release of the Tang-character tugs was entirely due to someone relying on a certain force to attempt to seize property rights and seek to resume operations. They are currently organizing a so-called "shipping company," recruiting teahouse staff and crew members, and collecting deposits indiscriminately. However, it is heard that Wah Mei Navigation Company, due to creditor-debtor relations, cannot remain silent and is now searching for evidence to take necessary steps to respond.

### China Childhood Welfare Association; Development of Childhood Welfare Undertakings; Churches in Various Places Cooperate to Implement Relief Plans; Solicitation of 10,000 Sets of Winter Clothing for Refugee Children; Hope for Support

The China Childhood Welfare Association is a popular organization in China that promotes child welfare. Its headquarters was originally located in Shanghai. After the August 13th Incident, in order to facilitate relief work, the general headquarters was specially moved to Chongqing, and an office was established in Shanghai. This association has been engaged in this year

Rescue Work

In Qin County, Yongji, Liulin, Qishi in Shanxi; Mengjin, Tanghe, Songbai, Taikang, Fugou, Lingbao, Huayin, Yancheng, Zhengzhou in Henan; Jingmen, Shayang, Xingshan, Zigui, Dangyang, Fang County, Gu County, Xiangyang, Fancheng, Yichang in Hubei, and other places, it has dispatched a large number of relief workers to carry out child rescue work.

Location of Institutions

The association currently has the Zhengzhou Childhood Welfare Institute, Luoyang Childhood Welfare Institute, Xuchang Childhood Welfare Institute, Yuxian Childhood Welfare Institute, Qinyang Childhood Welfare Institute, Dengxian Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Yiyang Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Wuyang Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Xi'an Orphan Education and Training Institute, Xi'an Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Fengxiang Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Mei County Shoe Children's Education and Training Institute, Jingyang Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Lintong Refugee Children's Education Training Institute, Baoji Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Chongqing Childhood Welfare Institute, Liangshan Childhood Welfare Institute, Langzhong Childhood Welfare Institute, Shizishan Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Wanxian Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Fengjie Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, and other 21 relief agencies. The number of children admitted is 15,850 (the total number of children admitted before and after is more than 40,000).

Church Cooperation

The association not only provides relief to children in the war zones of the interior, but also plans to provide relief to refugee children in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces. With the cooperation of the National Christian Council of China and churches in various places, the plan will be gradually implemented. The association has established a childhood welfare clinic in Chongqing, publishes the "Today's Children Semi-Monthly," and organizes a wartime childhood welfare staff training class, hoping to cultivate suitable personnel to preside over the wartime childhood education and training work in various places.

Chongqing Work

Because Chongqing has been changed to the national capital, there are frequent air raids. Whenever an air raid occurs, it dispatches emergency rescue teams, under the flames, in the burned areas of the city, engaged in rescuing children. In addition to sending injured children to hospitals for treatment, children who are homeless after being bombed are handed over to temporary shelters and then transferred to education and training institutions for proper resettlement. The above describes the situation of the general headquarters.

Shanghai Aspect

As for the Shanghai office, it currently maintains the Infant Shelter (116 Da Xi Road), Children's Shelter (181 Jisi Fei Er Road), Childhood Education and Training Institute (1131 Lafayette Road), Civilian Education and Training Institute (99, Lane 258, Wuding Road), and other childhood experimental institutions, accommodating children from newborns to 16 years old, and also admitting maids from 6 to 17 years old. Last year, a total of 1,857 children were admitted. The number of children currently admitted is 752.

Educational Policy

The education policy that the office guides in various experimental institutions is to appropriately coordinate child education with child placement education. In addition to implementing universal training for all children, special training suitable for the personality and future development of individual children with different situations is also implemented. The office's placement of children is divided into introducing apprenticeships, allowing people to adopt, and (selecting spouses for girls), etc. Regarding adoption matters, the handling is very meticulous. Adopters must find a guarantor, answer questions, and wait for investigation. Once the adoption is completed, a review is conducted after three months, and a visit is conducted after one year. This visit is conducted three times, and the special guardianship period is three years. The office also handles the promotion of parental education, treatment of children's diseases, and protection of abused children.

Solicitation of Winter Clothing

Recently, a winter clothing campaign has been launched to make 10,000 sets of winter clothing for refugee children in the city. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively support the completion of this charitable act.

### Ruirong Shipyard Work Stoppage Resolved; Workers' Representative Released; Demands Not Expected to be Disappointed

A dismissal dispute at the Ruirong Shipyard in Yangshupu, owned by the British merchant, caused a strike. Now, in order to take into account the overall situation, both labor and management have reached a compromise the day before yesterday, so all workers have resumed work. Zhang Shunde, the arrested workers' representative, has also been released on bail by the factory. Because the issue of severance pay or reinstatement for the 30 dismissed workers still needs to be discussed, they are temporarily not working. The factory has promised to consider all other demands made by the workers, and will not disappoint the workers.

### Puppet Police Reduced in Shanghai West; Reportedly Transferred to the South City and Zhabei to Take Over Defense

A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inspected the area west of Shanghai yesterday and found that the puppet police had suddenly decreased. At each road intersection, there was only one puppet policeman managing traffic. The puppet police stationed on the sidewalks have been withdrawn from many locations, and the puppet patrols that were commonly seen have also disappeared. In the area around Kaixuan Road, Da Xi Road, and Anhe Temple Road, security is very tight, and pedestrians are frequently interrogated. As for the eastern and western parts of the French Concession, households are frequently searched by Japanese and puppet troops and police. It is rumored locally that due to the fierce fighting in northern Hunan and southern Guangxi and the thinness of troop strength, the troops from all over had to be mobilized to reinforce them, so the Japanese troops in Hongkou, Nanshi, and Zhabei in Shanghai were transferred, and the above-mentioned locations were mostly replaced by puppet police taking over sentry posts. Therefore, the number of puppet police in western Shanghai has decreased, but this statement cannot be confirmed.

### Chongqing-Chengdu Transportation Available by Ship

According to sources in Chongqing, goods for export from Chengdu to Chongqing have recently been mostly transported by water using civilian ships due to the high cost of automobile transportation. It takes six days to arrive when the water is high, and no more than ten days when the water is low. The shipping cost is only over 200 yuan per 10,000 catty, which is several times cheaper than automobile transportation. If goods are transported to the interior by land, human-powered trolleys can be used, each trolley can carry half a ton to a ton of weight. In addition, there are mule carts that can also be loaded, and although the load is greater than that of the trolleys, the transportation cost is higher and the speed is faster.

### Japanese Plan to Open Nanshi to Establish Gambling Dens; Demand for Houses Adjacent to Concessions Increases Sharply

Nanshi Will Become a Den of All Evils, According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Japanese authorities decided to open Nanshi, including or partially including the refugee area, from November 1st, which is widely rumored. Many people went to find houses there. It is said that most of the house seekers intend to open gambling dens and opium dens in Nanshi. Although the rumors about

Reopening of Nanshi

Have not been confirmed, the demand for houses in Nanshi has increased sharply. Small two-story houses already have rent transfer fees of 200 yuan. However, the landlords have not received any rent since the war started, and now they are hoarding and asking for even higher fees. It is said that the area that will be reopened for

Chinese Residents

Is the northwest of Nanshi and the area connected to Minguo Road, including the large refugee area. Because the area is close to the central area of ​​the concession, it has attracted the attention of those who run gambling dens and opium dens. It is said that those who are currently

Running Gambling Dens and Opium Dens

In the western part of Shanghai, because Nanshi is close to the French Concession, most of them are looking for houses in Nanshi in order to operate a more prosperous gambling industry. Moreover, the expenses will be less because in the west of Shanghai, they are subject to blackmail by the Japanese, the "municipal government" and the "Peace Preservation Corps".

Move to Nanshi

As to whether the Yimiao area will be included in the area to be reopened, it is not certain today. If it is included, the area will become a den of evils such as gambling and opium pills.

### YWCA Fundraising Rally; First Achievement

The 31st annual fundraising rally of the Shanghai YWCA has been open since November 20th. Although it encountered continuous heavy rain and severe cold, the captains, members, and consultants were enthusiastic about service and went out to raise funds in the rain and cold. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of all sectors of Shanghai, the results of the first achievement were announced yesterday and were very satisfactory. On that day, Mrs. Huang Tanfu presided over the meeting, and the team leaders reported the achievements they have made.

### Japanese Attempt to Repair Wusong Road

The outer road along the Yunzaobang in Wusong was previously built by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The road surface was paved with asphalt, and the project was solid. When the war broke out two years ago, the road was destroyed by guns and artillery. The stone embankment in the eastern section along the shore was also collapsed by shells, causing severe damage. Vehicles traveling to and from are especially dangerous. Zhongdao, the head of the Japanese Propaganda Group in Baoshan, proposed to several people in Wusong the other day to repair the road, starting from the Yunzaobang Bridge in the west, extending east to Paohe Bay, but it would cost a lot of money and it would be difficult to raise funds, and it may be difficult to achieve at present. Unexpectedly, the Gaoqiao puppet "National Association" has recently posted recruitment notices everywhere, saying that Wusong is recruiting 300 workers to repair the road, with wages of 8 jiao per person, food and lodging provided, and bedding self-provided. Those who recruit 20 people will be filled as foremen with salaries of 1.1 yuan, etc. When the reporter asked the relevant parties in Wusong yesterday, they replied that they did not know about this matter. The repair of Wusong Road is only based on Zhongdao's empty words, and there is no definite preparation news. Gaoqiao's recruitment of workers must have other purposes, it is said.

### Hotel Industry Increases Prices by 20%; Implemented on December 1st

The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association decided to increase the price by 20% of the original price due to the arrival of winter and the use of heating in each hotel, but this year the price of coal has doubled. The following is a record of the announcement: Announcement: Due to the arrival of winter, the weather is getting colder and colder. In the past, the industry should appropriately increase the selling price and use heating. However, the price of coal this year is several times higher than in previous years, and even if it is increased, it is only a drop in the bucket, and the gains do not outweigh the losses. Therefore, a special meeting was convened on November 8th to discuss coping strategies. It was agreed that the skyrocketing price of coal is an indisputable fact. However, it is impossible not to increase the selling price and stop using heating. Therefore, under duress, in addition to enduring the pain of slightly increasing the selling price to partially compensate, there is really no other way. Therefore, it was decided on the spot that from December 1st, the original selling price will be increased by 20% across the board to cover part of the losses, etc. The records are on file. It is believed that all these difficulties are also understood by the patrons. In addition to the announcement by the association to all industries, another announcement is made.

By noon, the indoor temperature had reached 56 degrees, and the minimum was still above 40 degrees. Also, a reporter from Daguan News Agency learned from Pushan Villa yesterday that although the weather turned warmer in the morning, many beggars in various places continued to die. Although it cannot be said that it was entirely caused by being unable to withstand the cold, it is still related. The locations where they were found are recorded as follows: In the Public Concession area, there was (1) a male corpse of more than 40 years old at 5 Ma Road, Zhengfeng Street; (2) a male corpse of more than 30 years old at Anhe Temple Road, Kaixuan Road; (3) three male corpses aged between 30 and 40 at Wuhu Road, Xishanglin; (4) a male corpse of more than 40 years old at Robertsheng Road, Jiaozhou Road; (5) a male corpse of more than 30 years old at Jiaozhou Road, Binlang Road; (6) a female corpse of more than 30 years old at 6 Ma Road, Guangxi Road; (7) three male corpses in the east town of Fahua.

the cause of the incident

was that the at-large Zhang Jiuguan, Wang Ayue, and the three who have now been arrested planned to rob a wealthy household in Ziyang Lane that day. However, because the wealthy household had many family members, they could not succeed. They were wandering around the alley entrance when a woman surnamed Ma, the wife of the deceased Cai Dehong's disciple, nicknamed Ma Zhanshan, who made a living selling the drug morphine, happened to pass by with several packets of morphine hidden on her body. She saw Zhang Jiuguan and others and

suspected they were going to rob

her of her morphine. She reported it to her husband, Ma Zhanshan, who told the deceased. Cai then gathered more than ten people and rushed to the scene.

### Lawsuit for Payment of Public Expenses, Appeal Against the Judgment

Li Shiyang, the deceased director of the Zhengtai Railway Bureau and official in the Ministry of Finance, originally from Hunan, had his first wife, Li Shou (also known as Shou Yu), living in Beiping with their children. In the spring of the 25th year of the Republic, Li married Sun Huifen, a woman from Suzhou, in Hangzhou and gave her 50,000 gold as alimony. They then came to Shanghai and lived together in Jing'an Villa. After the August 13th Incident in the 26th year of the Republic, Li Shou brought her children from Ping to Shanghai, and Li rented a house at No. 25 Jingucun, Jin Shenfu Road, to live together. On Double Ten Day of that year, Li fell ill and died in Guangci Hospital. Sun claimed to have received the gift of gold, and Li Shou discovered that her husband had committed adultery and lived with Sun, so she filed a private prosecution against Sun for disrupting the family in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. She also commissioned lawyer Li Jinbiao to file a civil lawsuit against Sun in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court to confirm the ownership of the bank deposit, but it has not yet been concluded.

### Elderly Man Dies Unexpectedly, Son Commits Suicide and Comes to Shanghai to Transport Coffin, Struck and Killed by Military Vehicle Upon Landing at Wharf

Xia Rongsheng, an elderly man from Ningbo in his sixties, was 61 years old this year. He had been farming in his hometown. His son, Xia Fuyue, was 30 years old this year and worked as a waiter on a ship. In April of this year, after an argument with his mistress, Ms. Lin, in Shanghai, Fuyue committed suicide by poisoning himself. After the police reported to the court for inspection, Ms. Lin claimed the body, and the coffin was temporarily buried in the Shantang Cemetery. Xia Rongsheng received the news in his hometown and was saddened by his son's tragic death. He recently raised money in his hometown and resided in the workshop at the Roosevelt Wharf in the Sixteenth Pupu, intending to transport his son's coffin back to his hometown for burial. Unexpectedly, Xia Rongsheng was passing by the Xin Kaihe area of the Bund in the French Concession at 4:45 PM on the 27th when a Japanese vehicle numbered 103, a truck, was speeding from north to south and turning west. Xia was unable to avoid it and was knocked down, injuring his head. The police found him, recorded the truck number, and reported it to the police station. They also summoned an ambulance to take Xia to Guangci Hospital, but he died before he could be treated. The body was transferred to the autopsy center, and the Second Special Court was requested to send a prosecutor to the center yesterday afternoon to verify that the deceased, Xia Rongsheng, had indeed died from being hit by a car. The corpse belonged to relatives in the countryside, and relative Chen Dingde signed on their behalf to claim the body and coffin.

### Yongzhen Still Not Imported, Baoli Tries to Sail to Wenzhou

The Yongzhen ship continued to sail to Wenzhou on the 23rd for its final trial voyage. However, as of yesterday afternoon, the company had not yet received a telegram stating that the ship had been approved for import. Therefore, it is believed that the ship is still being blocked outside the mouth of the Ou River. Also, the British ship Jess Maller (transliteration) sailed directly to Wenzhou from Ningbo a few days ago and is said to have been imported. According to news from the Italian company Yihua, the Baoli ship of the company has been completed after being repaired in the dock and started its trial voyage to Wenzhou at 4:00 PM yesterday. Whether it can be imported is still difficult to predict.

### Car Crash on Xinzha Road

Tram Crashes into Public Bus

Yesterday afternoon around 4:20 PM, a tram on Route 3 crashed into a public bus on Route 10 near the East Entrance of Xinzha Road in the Public Concession, near the bus stop. At that time, the Route 10 bus was in front, traveling from west to east, and was about to arrive at the station when the Route 3 tram behind it could not catch up and failed to stop, causing the rear glass of the Route 10 bus to be shattered. The passengers in the car were all frightened, but fortunately, no one was injured. Afterwards, Chinese and Western patrolmen arrived, recorded the numbers of the tram drivers, etc., and traffic was stopped for about fifteen minutes.

### A Picture of Refugees After the Disaster—The Tragic Situation After the Fire in the Slum—

— New Dream

It seems that big fires and cold weather are inseparable. The colder the weather, the more fire alarms there are. In Shanghai, especially in slums, the so-called shantytown areas, a fire always burns dozens, even hundreds, of rooms. This year, the shantytowns on Yanping Road have once again suffered the tragedy of a big fire first.

It was suddenly extremely cold that Saturday, and the wind was blowing so hard that everyone was saying they couldn't take it. I went out in the afternoon for some errands and saw fire trucks from various districts passing by on Kangnauwan Road with an emergency order. Approaching Yanping Road, I could already see black flames rising into the sky, high in the air, so that anyone could see that the fire was not small. Onlookers were rushing to follow the fire trucks, and among them were a few old women crying and shouting, "It's bad! It's over!" making it clear that their homes had been destroyed by fire.

The next morning, I went to Yanping Road specifically to find the place where the fire had burned, to make a "decisive" inspection. I asked someone and learned that it was right next to Shenyuan, entered a lane, and soon found the fire site. The smell of smoke was still very strong, wafting into my nose. There were hundreds of shantytowns here, all houses built of straw and reed mats, so short that tall people could not walk in. After this "decisive" big fire, more than sixty rooms were burned down, and dozens of others were spared. Fortunately, it was during the day, and only one child was burned to death.

On the fire site, there were piles of black ash to the east and piles of embers to the west. Mothers were holding their children, sitting under the burned-out mud walls. Jars, urns, and pots were scattered on the ground, not burned by the fire. Loud cries and wails filled the air as they lost their homes. Many women were crying and grabbing things from the embers. Men were carrying burned clothes and moving to other places to live. This picture of refugees made people who witnessed it unable to hold back tears of sympathy!

I chatted with a few people casually and learned that the fire was started by a restaurant next door. Although no one was burned to death, several pigs raised by the shantytown residents were burned to death. These poor people had fled into the concessions from Hudong and Zhabei after the war, and only built shacks to live in near Shenyuan. In terms of occupation, most of the men were rickshaw pullers, coolies, and peddlers, while the women sewed clothes for the poor or worked in factories. The children mostly scavenged for garbage, so life was naturally very difficult.

One shantytown resident told me with emotion that these days rice is like pearls and firewood is like cinnamon. Normally, it is difficult enough to make a living, but unexpectedly, they have suffered this fire. In the future, it will not only be difficult to find other houses, but they will also not have money to rebuild on the original site. After this fire, a large family has the pain of having nowhere to go. It made me feel very sad to hear that.

### Encountered with Tianqing

— Bao Tianyi

Chapter 18: Discussing the Economic Prosperity of the Old City, Describing the Legacy of Marriage Plunder

Shao Huihua said, "Of course! Without such a time, China's progress might not have been so fast. Everything is stimulated and swayed, and then there are all kinds of changes. There is a Chinese saying: 'Learn a lesson every time you suffer a loss.' At that time, we thought that a house like that would cost 3,000 yuan, which was not cost-effective. Let's go to another place to look for it. Who knew that other places were the same? There was also a kind of speculative nature. They rented a large piece of land, built houses in pieces, gave you a contract, and asked you to pay a rent of 18,000. They set a term of fifteen years or twenty years. When the term expires, they choose you from all the 10,000 or 8,000 yuan you paid before. This method is a clever one, and it doesn't suffer in both ways. If there is an honest business firm or a reliable banker, it would be good. But we can't wait, we don't know when their houses will be built. Moreover, the low cost of building their houses and the remoteness of the road are also conceivable. We had no choice but to go back to the place where we used to ask for a top fee of 3,000 yuan to ask. Who knew that less than a week later, two or three days before, someone had already taken it away with 3,000 yuan. Later, we really had no way, so we rented a three-story building with a pavilion room for 90 yuan a month, which is what Shanghai people call a three-tenant. The second landlord had very strict restrictions. The lights could only be turned on until 12 o'clock. Tap water was only available three times a day, and the rest of the time it was locked up. Each phone call cost five points, cash transaction. We borrowed their house, as if we were entrusting someone to live under the eaves, so we had to swallow our anger. But when the war stopped, those who had fled to Shanghai all moved back to the mainland. Because many families had their own houses in the mainland, why should they come to Shanghai to live in this cramped place? At that time, Shanghai's population of 5 million clearly dropped to less than 2 million. All the crowded houses before were empty. The telephone poles on the road were all covered with rent advertisements. The short line advertisements in the newspapers were all filled with rental advertisements. At that time, we rented a very spacious four-story building for 50 yuan. But we also have houses and jobs in the mainland. We have a house by the West Lake in Hangzhou, with sails reflecting in the windows and mountain scenery on the pillow. Why don't we go live there? At this time, Shanghai's real estate agents were really defeated. If they sold the land and houses to others, no one wanted them. If they mortgaged the real estate to the bank, the bankers also declined. Why? If there are houses but no one lives in them, and they can't collect rent, the land price will naturally fall." (208)

Life Report

### Comrades in the Abyss

— Xiao

Every time those foreign ships come into port, there are always many people gathered on the dock waiting. You naturally know that those people are customs officials and workers, etc., but what I want to tell you here is: another group of people.

That group of people are all comrades in their twenties and thirties, some wearing overalls and others wearing old suits. They gathered in a corner of the dock, each talking with excited hope:

"I heard that the sailors on this ship are going to be replaced! I think I will definitely have a chance. I have been a sailor for ten years, and I am completely skilled, so there is definitely hope!"

"But I don't know how many stokers on the ship will be replaced?"

It turns out that the lower-level crew members (sailors and stokers) hired on those foreign ships are all Chinese. The foreign bosses' calculations are very precise: because the wages of Chinese people are low! After the ship arrives in Shanghai, they are busy arranging those comrades, quickly replacing new people who have resigned, and naturally also replacing those who are lazy at work; and these "great powers" are in the hands of the head of those comrades. So many people pleaded with the head, hoping to get a position. After being busy for a while, the new and old comrades were arranged, and the head led them to be examined by the doctor for their physical condition. Many comrades who were not "selected" still had a little hope at this time:

"Maybe there will be someone who fails the physical examination, right? That kid just recovered from syphilis!"

After the physical examination is over, everything can be said to be settled. So the next day, a month's salary is issued to each person first. This matter seems quite serious, and the head said solemnly in front of the comrades:

"Do you know? A month's salary is issued first. The salary for skilled workers is 30 yuan, and the salary for unskilled workers is 15 yuan! Everyone can only take half of it in the first month, do you know?"

Yes, those comrades all knew it: that was the "rule"! It is said that it is not easy to be a head, and who did not spend money to get here! Besides, I heard that the salary issued by the company is more than 30 yuan each, so what are skilled and unskilled workers! But for the sake of life, no one dares to resist the authority and interests of the head, and silently, those comrades are carried out time and time again, and then brought back again.

They will naturally have days to come back, because the ships are regular. But after returning to Shanghai, many comrades were dismissed by the head again. Why?

"I understand myself!" One of the dismissed comrades said: "Because I don't like gambling! The head hopes to play poker all day and all night, so he has money to draw! We who don't gamble are naturally given the cold shoulder by him. If our work is a little slower, we will be scolded. Serves us right! Those friends who gamble day and night, the head is of course more polite to them, but look at their pay slips, look!"

Look! It is written clearly on the pay slips of those gambling comrades: how much is the total salary for one year, how much has been borrowed on the way, how much is owed, and how much should be paid for various fees and donations. In summary, what? After working hard for a year, they only saved three old foreign coins! Some even owe the head money, because he lost too much.

These comrades are always in the abyss, and are always a poor wretch! They are just a group of slaves in the abyss.

Does anyone think of them? Those poor slaves!

### In Memory of Mr. Ma Xiangbo

— Xiang Weichen

Mr. Xiang Weichen from Ruian had a 40-year friendship with Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a centenarian from Danyang. When he heard that Old Xiang had passed away in Liangshan, he mourned Old Xiang with a couplet:

The world has many teachers, but China has only one centenarian.

May the spirits in the emperor's court protect the Three Principles of the People for our party.

### The Forward-Moving Artists and Audiences Should Cherish the True Spirit of Performing Arts

— Xin Liang

Every department of the performing arts, whether it be Ping opera, spoken drama, singing, or broadcasting, has a very close relationship with our lives. It is undeniable that a play with great consciousness and a tight plot, or a passionate and moving song, can give us a stimulant like strong coffee. Even an illiterate person, after watching ten plays full of national righteousness, cannot help but be stirred by a passionate patriotic sentiment.

Let's not talk about other places, but just discuss the performing arts scene in Shanghai. Mr. Zhou Xinfang's performance in "Meishan Hen" (Regret at Meishan) at the Carlton has moved tens of thousands of people. When we see Emperor Chongzhen's tragic situation and his sorrowful mood, how moved our hearts are. Similarly, "Ming Mo Yi Hen" (Remnants of the Late Ming Dynasty, also known as Bi Xue Hua or Blood-Stained Flowers), currently being performed at the Xuanting Theatre, naturally evokes a sense of patriotism after watching it. From this, we understand that using performing arts to instill ideas in everyone is the most profound and unforgettable method. No wonder some say that using drama and songs to promote justice and inspire people yields results far beyond those of monotonous preaching.

We must not regard performing arts as a passive so-called "entertainment"! Performers should not adopt a casual attitude, and audiences should not treat it merely as a "pastime" or something to "seek pleasure" from. Because of the deep and significant influence that every department of the performing arts has on humanity, we should all rise up to protect and promote the unique spirit of the performing arts.

We sincerely pay tribute to the artists and audiences who cherish the performing arts, but looking back, here and now in Shanghai, how many are neglecting the purpose of performing arts and using it as a tool to numb people's minds! The naked dance that relies solely on flesh to attract audiences is still appearing here, and the general audience seems willing to flock there to seek a moment of stimulation. Under the trampling of such people, the pure spirit of performing arts is being damaged.

Let us look again: the enthusiasm of the performing arts in Chongqing, where every department's performance can be said to prioritize the nation and the country, has stirred the patriotic sentiments of millions of people in the inland, and aroused the sense of justice in each of us... Can't we do something like this in Shanghai? It is true that Shanghai's situation is not free, but can't we even achieve the negative condition of "never using performing arts to numb people's minds"? I personally hope that those artists and audiences who have always valued the true spirit of performing arts can work harder and more actively. We must make the entire Shanghai performing arts scene gradually awaken from the abyss of debauchery and march forward towards a bright goal! We must eliminate all obstacles on this road—the group that is using the face of performing arts to numb people's minds! Forward-moving artists! Strive on!

### My Suggestions for Movie Theaters

— Lu Ping

I am a movie lover, but I often encounter many difficulties when looking for movies to watch: first, which movie theater to go to; second, which movie theater's film suits my taste. Regarding these two points, I would like to boldly offer this suggestion to some movie theaters.

Everyone knows that movie audiences have different preferences: some like suspenseful films, some like passionate ones, some like happy ones, some like sad ones... some focus on plot, some focus on visuals, some focus on structure... Regardless of the size of the audience, I believe that buying a ticket after seeing a synopsis is always more interesting than buying a ticket without seeing a synopsis. (Newspaper advertisements only attract a small group who rarely watch movies.)

As for how to let the audience see the synopsis? It couldn't be simpler. As long as for a certain film, at the entrance or on the wall of the theater showing the film, use appropriate methods to post the synopsis in relatively large characters. It is economical and saves time, and is truly worth trying. I hope that all movie theaters will pay attention to it.

### Chatting About Steel-Stringed Erhu

— Kelou Louzhu

The steel-stringed erhu is an instrument used to accompany Cantonese music. Although it is also an erhu, its structure is slightly different from that of ordinary silk-stringed erhus. I am fond of music theory. When I have nothing to do, I once fantasized about replacing the silk strings of an ordinary silk-stringed erhu with steel strings. Sitting alone in my small room, I played it with varying tones, and the charm was unique. Thus, I wrote this article to share with fellow enthusiasts.

Steel strings are available in hardware stores, but they must be brand new and flawless, with no bends or black spots. Soak them in boiling water and then in cold water for a moment. Take them out and use them. They are not easily broken (German products are the best). Otherwise, the sound will change, and even if you play strictly, it will be useless. When playing the strings, you should tightly press the tuning pegs with your knees, lean your body slightly, and exert force on your arms. With slight vibrations, you can handle the high and low tones and bends as you wish, without worrying about the strings breaking like silk strings. In the quiet of the night, try playing a few sections of Cantonese music such as "Han Palace Autumn Moon," "Zou Ma Ying Xiong" (Galloping Hero), or "Zhaojun's Lament." The sound is so mournful and poignant, so desolate and lonely, that it sounds like "a midnight crow cawing," making people unable to bear to listen. If you play Peking opera, it is not pleasant at all, because the sound is too delicate and seems beyond its capability. But if you play "Liu Yao Jin" (Golden Willows Swaying) and other "interlude" tunes, it is exquisitely beautiful and has a unique charm, which is incomparable to silk-stringed erhus.

Two Clumsy Young Masters in the Peking Amateur Opera Circle

Beijing is an ancient city of six or seven hundred years, and there are many large mansions of princes and nobles. It is not uncommon for each mansion to have hundreds of rooms. However, if the owner of such a large courtyard becomes poor, sometimes they cannot even afford sesame seed cakes. Often, one can see vendors selling sesame seed cakes and peanuts in front of the gates of large mansions, yelling and scolding at the gate for a long time, but no one comes out to pay the few dollars owed for sesame seed cakes that have accumulated day after day. This situation is probably rare in Shanghai. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, many hereditary princes and nobles had descendants who had no ability to produce anything. After the cash was spent, they could initially auction off some antiques and furniture. After that was spent, they had to call the small drum player (a profession unique to Beijing, specializing in buying old items, carrying a pole and using a small drum to signal). When they got to the point of selling junk, they were not far from selling the house. Because these types of residences are large, if the previous owner of the house had buried some gold, silver, and jewelry under the floorboards of a certain courtyard or room, or inside the walls, and then encountered an unexpected assignment to an official position in another location, or died suddenly of illness, or did not tell his descendants where the treasure was hidden before his death, then when the new owner of the house renovated it, they could often obtain an unexpected fortune, which, after deducting the cost of buying the house, would probably be several times the profit. The most famous Beijing ×× Hospital is said to have been built so magnificently because it obtained this unexpected fortune. There are also a few other places, but I will not list them because I do not know the details. The two clumsy young masters I want to talk about now are people I see often, and the previous owners of both of them were prominent officials in the Qing Dynasty. I have often visited one of the residences, and I feel that it is a pity that such a large mansion was sold for only tens of thousands of yuan, and that such a rare and strange event occurred. Therefore, I am mentioning these two incidents to inform the readers (151).
