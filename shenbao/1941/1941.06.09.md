### British Troops Assist Free French Forces, Enter Syria and Lebanon, Guaranteeing the Liberation and Independence of Both Places, Vichy Announces Full Defense of This Mandated Territory

Cairo: According to an official announcement from here, Free French troops, with the assistance of British Empire forces, entered Syria and Lebanon this morning. This military action is proceeding according to a pre-arranged plan. The entry of Allied forces into Syria began at 2:00 AM. This action is primarily political in nature, aimed at preventing German forces from using Syrian bases for any activity. (Reuters, 8th)

London: When Free French forces, assisted by British Empire forces, entered Syria and Lebanon, the British government issued a communique declaring the reasons for taking this important step. Simultaneously, General Catroux, commander of the Free French forces in the Middle East, issued a declaration in his name, guaranteeing the liberation and independence of Syria and Lebanon. (Reuters, 8th)

London: Lieutenant General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, commander of the Allied forces in Syria, previously commanded the British mechanized units in Libya when they advanced from Sidi Barrani towards Benghazi. He was later ordered to coordinate British forces in Greece. Recently, Wilson was appointed commander of British forces in Palestine and Transjordan. Wilson's ancestors are quite famous in British military history. (Reuters, 8th)

Vichy: The government formally announced today that British troops attacked Syria this morning. According to a report from the Syrian High Commissioner Dentz to Vichy, fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Jebel Druze mountains south of Soueida on the Jordanian border. A government spokesperson stated, "We will maintain Dentz's position and will never yield." This statement refers to Dentz's assertion that the French forces in Syria will defend this French-mandated territory. (Associated Press, 8th)

Vichy: Official reports received here state that British troops, together with the Catroux faction, attacked Syria at dawn today from Palestine, with a force of 20,000 men. The Syrian garrison has risen to resist, and fighting is underway. According to responsible sources here, Britain's adoption of this military action and collaboration with French traitors, causing Frenchmen to kill each other, carries a heavy responsibility. As for French policy, it will continue to maintain its territories "within the realm of possibility." (Havas, 8th)

Berlin: According to an announcement from the Vichy government, it will defend Syria with the maximum possible garrison. According to a statement from the Vichy government issued by the German official news agency, British and Catroux faction troops have declared Syria occupied by German forces and are attacking it. A man named Catroux issued a notice inciting the people of the French-mandated area to revolt against France. The French government has repeatedly stated that there are no German troops in Syria; therefore, Britain is committing another improper attack on French territory. (Reuters, 8th)

Cairo: As far as is known here, anti-German sentiment is extremely strong among the soldiers and junior officers of the French forces in Syria and Lebanon. If there is any resistance in the two places, it will necessarily come from the minority ruling class who still blindly follow orders from Vichy. As for whether all the people of the two places will unite under a common purpose to expel the Germans, it is not yet possible to determine. (Reuters, 8th)

London: The headquarters of the Free French forces in London announced this morning that they have not received any news regarding the developments in Syria or Weygand's attitude towards the Free French forces' entry into Syria. (Reuters, 8th)

London: 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister's residence, revealed that the British Ambassador to Egypt, Lampson, has issued a declaration calling on the residents of Syria to overthrow Vichy rule and join the Allies, stating that if the Syrian people do so, the British government will grant them all the rights enjoyed by free nations allied with Britain. (Associated Press, 8th)

Vichy: Vichy political figures announced this afternoon that British troops have invaded southern Syria. French officials in Syria and Lebanon, led by Dentz, are currently directing French troops to defend the safety of Syria and fight the enemy. The British troops' actions of crossing the border to provoke trouble are absolutely unjust. Such unreasonable provocations by British troops are not without precedent, such as the British military's invasion of (1) Mers-el-Kebir, (2) Dakar, (3) Gabon, (4) New Caledonia, and (5) Tahiti. In all of the aforementioned locations, there was no trace of German troops, yet they launched military actions. As for the fact that a few German planes landed at Syrian airfields, France does not deny it. The German planes were at the airfields for a very short time, which the British knew, so why bother launching military action? Former British Minister to Egypt Lampson used the lifting of the blockade of Syria as bait to lure Syria into the embrace of Britain and join the British faction, and the depth of his intention is now obvious. (Haitong Press, 8th)

Moscow: Diplomatic circles here recently declared that Soviet newspapers have not made any comment on the situation in Iraq and Syria, indicating that the government's attitude has not yet been firmly decided. However, this does not mean that the government authorities are indifferent. It is noteworthy that the scope of the European war is gradually approaching, and the Soviet Union's position is more pivotal than in the past, so it must be especially cautious. (Havas, 8th)

### General Catroux Arrives in Haifa to Command in Syria

Vichy: Unconfirmed reports received here yesterday state that Free French General Catroux has arrived in Haifa and is currently aboard a British warship, preparing to command the "Free French" in the war for the French-mandated territory of Syria. (Associated Press, 8th)

Managua, Nicaragua: Vichy Consul Dreifus here has resigned, believing that Vichy's cooperation with Germany is not in France's interest. Dreifus also said that the French residents of Nicaragua unanimously support General Catroux. (Reuters, 8th)

### German Placement of Mines Around Cyprus, One Oil Tanker Sinks After Striking a Mine, Ten German and Italian Pilots Detained in Turkey

Ankara: The Germans have laid mines in the seas around Cyprus. Several mines have already been washed ashore on the Turkish coast. A Turkish small motor vessel carrying oil between two ports of that country recently sank suddenly off the coast, opposite the mainland. It was probably struck by a floating mine. There has apparently been discussion of a Turkish investigation into the sinking. Some quarters suggest that the German placement of mines is a prelude to an attack on Cyprus. Seven German pilots and three Italian pilots, whose planes were forced to land in Turkish territory, have now arrived in Ankara and are being detained. (Reuters, 8th)

Istanbul: Yesterday, a ship sent out a distress signal mid-voyage. Diplomatic circles believe it was en route to the Black Sea from here. It was probably either torpedoed or struck a mine. Reliable sources also say that Turkish anti-aircraft batteries near Bozcaada shot down an unidentified seaplane, a Dornier type, which was searching for submarines. The plane flew too close to the Turkish coast, causing the anti-aircraft batteries to open fire. (Associated Press, 8th)

Cyprus: For the past few days, unidentified planes have frequently flown over the island at extremely high altitudes, causing alerts to be issued day and night. However, no bombs have been dropped. It is believed that these are German planes flying to Syria. Civilians on the island are still continuing to evacuate to the countryside. (Associated Press, 8th)

Nicosia: According to news today, a squadron of German and Italian warplanes is flying from Greece to Syria via the Dodecanese Islands. Several Axis planes flew over Cyprus this morning but did not drop any bombs. It is said that the main destination of Axis planes in Syria is the Aleppo airfield, and several others are landing at the Palmyra and Damascus airfields. Although there is no sign of a large-scale arrival of Nazi airborne troops in Syria, there are reports that several German troop transports are mixed in with the planes flying to Syria. (International News Service, 8th)

New York: According to a German wireless message received here today, Damascus, the capital of Syria, has been repeatedly bombed by British planes. (International News Service, 8th)

London: As revealed yesterday, Axis forces are prepared for battle; therefore, war in Syria could break out at any time. The London Express reports that an air division with 500 planes, tanks, and mechanized equipment is currently en route to Syria from Nantes. South African troops are currently traveling by truck along a 3,000-mile route to Egypt. (International News Service, 8th)

### German-Soviet Negotiations Encounter Disputes

Stockholm: While London and Berlin are concerned about the Soviet Union's attitude, neutral parties now believe that there must have been some disputes in the German-Soviet negotiations. A correspondent for the Social Democratic newspaper in Berlin commented on British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Stafford Cripps's journey, saying that German newspapers are all asking how Cripps was summoned to London by Eden, because his journey from Sweden to England must pass through German-controlled areas. People here are completely silent on this issue. (Reuters, 8th)

### Hitler Receives Bulgarian King, Hungarian Defense Minister Visits Italy

Berlin: The German official news agency announced yesterday that Führer Hitler received King Boris of Bulgaria, with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also in attendance. The content of the conversation is unknown. (Associated Press, 8th)

Budapest, Hungary: Hungarian Defense Minister General Bartha left for Rome yesterday afternoon. (Haitong Press, 8th)

### Former Iraqi Prime Minister Said to Be Sent to Turkey and Iran to Promote a Four-Nation Military Alliance, Baghdad's Order Has Not Yet Returned to Normal

Damascus: News from the Iraqi capital states that the country's former Prime Minister Said has been appointed as a minister without portfolio and dispatched to Turkey and Iran. (Havas, 7th)

Damascus: Iraq's new minister without portfolio, Said, a pro-British politician, will visit Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan to get the signatories of the Saadabad Pact to conclude a military alliance. Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan signed a non-aggression pact in 1935 at the Saadabad Palace in Iran. (Haitong, 8th)

Beirut: Arab figures here are closely watching the political situation in Iraq, saying that the formation of the Mitri cabinet does not mean that Iraq has surrendered to Britain, because any cooperation that cannot defend the interests and honor of Iraq and the Arab people is probably unacceptable to the Mitri cabinet. (Havas, 7th)

### Germany Plans to Gather a Large Army to Attack the Suez Canal

Ankara: Turkish sources believe that the German army is preparing to gather a large army of one million men and heavy tanks to attack the Suez Canal from Libya. The military action in Syria is only a plan to restrain and divide British forces in the Near and Middle East. It is believed that it will be difficult for Germany to send heavy war equipment to Syria to attack the strongly fortified Palestinian border. (Associated Press, 8th)

London: Baghdad's atmosphere is gradually improving, with more vehicles on the streets than before, but it has not yet returned to normal. It is believed here that the claim that Baghdad's mosque was destroyed by British planes is false. The Shiite pilgrimage site of Kadhimayn is intact. British planes are warned not to bomb places revered by Muslims. (Reuters, 8th)

Damascus: Baghdad Radio will suspend music programs for three days to mourn the Iraqi war dead. The entire nation also observed a minute of silence yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, and special prayers were held in various churches. (Haitong, 8th)

### Soviet Union Supplies Finland with Grain, While Criticizing Finland for Breaching Agreements

Moscow: As of June 1 of this year, Finnish goods shipped to the Soviet Union totaled only $885,600, but during the same period, the Soviet Union shipped goods worth $3,559,200 to Finland. The Soviet-Finnish trade agreement stipulates that the trade volume should reach $7.5 million on each side within the first year. In other words, Soviet shipments to Finland accounted for 47.4% of the total, but Finnish shipments to the Soviet Union accounted for only 11.4% of the total. Finland's failure to fulfill the terms of the agreement has clearly hindered the further development of trade between the two countries. However, in view of the increasingly serious food shortage in Finland, Soviet People's Commissar Sverdlov, on May 30 of last month, agreed to Finnish Minister Paasikivi's request to ship 20,000 tons of grain to Finland in the near future (excluding the 15,578 tons previously shipped to Finland). In addition, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade Mikoyan informed the Finnish minister on the same day that he had ordered the Export Trade Department to expedite the shipment of 20,000 tons of grain to Finland. As of June 6, 7,514 tons had been shipped to Finland. (TASS, 7th)

### Fifth Anniversary of Gorky's Death

Moscow: The 18th of this month marks the fifth anniversary of Gorky's death. The Soviet Union is preparing national commemorations. Gorky's works are extremely popular in the Soviet Union. Between 1917 and 1941, 35.5 million copies of his works in Russian and 5 million copies in other Soviet national languages were printed. In the era of Imperial Russia, only 1.83 million copies of Gorky's works were printed from 1894 to 1916. His plays are also popular. The films of his life story have been seen by 26 million people.

Editorial

### The Enigma of American-Japanese Relations

In the recent Far Eastern situation, the most noteworthy event, apart from the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations which have reached a critical juncture, is none other than the American-Japanese relationship. Following the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese pact and the Nazis' active eastward advance, the trend of deterioration in American-Japanese relations that the world had expected has only been occasionally seen in the statements of Japanese spokespersons and individual opinions. Recently, diplomatic contacts between the two sides have been frequent, and various rumors have spread endlessly. After repeated statements by the American authorities, yesterday's Associated Press report from Tokyo even suggested that the talks between American Ambassador to Japan Grew and Matsuoka might be a prelude to the initiation of improved relations between the United States and Japan. This suggests that the policy of appeasement is about to be revived in the Far East, which is a problem that urgently needs to be resolved.

Appeasement in the Far East once ran rampant, and even today, it has not disappeared from the ideals of some. What makes it particularly noteworthy is not the rumors themselves, but the current international situation, which is objectively creating an opportunity for the rise of appeasement in the Far East. The Tripartite Pact has not provided the Axis with assistance, but has only elevated Japan's pivotal position in the international arena. Regardless of whether the United States' three-ocean navy is not yet fully completed, even if it has the strength to be prepared for any eventuality, from a strategic point of view, fighting on two fronts is what any country tries to avoid. Therefore, as the United States gradually moves towards joining the war, how to prevent the application of the third clause of the Tripartite Pact by improving American-Japanese relations is always a very plausible reason. Thus, Roosevelt's fireside chat last week, which did not specifically mention the Pacific and the Far East, was seen as pleasing Japan, and Nomura's speech stating that Japan had not given up on improving relations with the United States soon followed. Recently, the frequent and active diplomatic contacts in Tokyo have shown that this attempt has moved from fantasy through probing to practical application.

The United States and Japan are not enemy countries or belligerents and have always maintained normal diplomatic relations. Therefore, there is no particularly surprising reason for the two sides to engage in diplomatic contacts. The problem lies in the true nature of the so-called improvement of relations, as well as whether it is possible and how to seek improvement. The United States is extremely concerned about the European situation, but the United States is also a Pacific nation and has significant interests in the Far East. Even if its views on the situation in the East and West differ in terms of urgency, it is difficult to imagine that it would apply completely different policies to deal with them separately. If it did so, how could it justify its consistent policy over the past decade and its policy of actively aiding China? Great vigilance must be exercised against the future offensive in the Atlantic by the Nazis, whose navy is almost non-existent, then it is clear that the naval threat from the world's third-ranked navy, which has always aimed to confront the United States, cannot be dealt with by appeasement. In the past ten days, the American authorities have twice stated that their policy towards Japan remains unchanged. In addition to rejecting the Japanese attempt to conclude a non-aggression pact, the exchange of letters between Hull and Kuo Tai-chi clearly demonstrated the United States' friendship and trust in China. Even if the rumors are not entirely without cause, they cannot weaken the effect of these official documents. Of course, the American authorities recently also stated that their policy remains unchanged, but the lack of a more active expression is probably the reason for the rumors and even the appeasement fantasies. Another statement by Hull on May 21 indicated that the United States had never taken the initiative in seeking an accommodation with the Japanese government, which clearly shows that it is not the American government that is eager to improve American-Japanese relations, but the other side. Combining the news from various sources in recent days, this movement is already actively underway. If the nature of its proposal is only to avoid the expansion of the Pacific war without changing the original order in the Far East, the American authorities will probably not reject it too severely, because what the United States is focusing on is only the stability and maintenance of order in the Far East, and the United States is not a warlike country. However, if it actually fantasizes about taking the opportunity to advance, wanting the American side to change its consistent policy, stop aiding China, and even recognize a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," then the so-called improvement of relations between the two countries can only be empty talk. Not only has the Soviet Union, which previously concluded a non-aggression treaty with Japan, rejected this type of condition, but even the Dutch-Indonesian side has so far refused to lose its position due to coercion in these negotiations, let alone the United States.

The current policy of the American side is undoubtedly sound, but its view that the European situation is more important than the Far East is an exploitable gap. In fact, no matter how much the aggressor shows off, the anti-aggression war is ultimately a whole and cannot be divided. The order and security of the Pacific do not depend on the good intentions of the aggressor, but entirely on whether the democratic countries have sufficient preparedness and strength to respond to changes. What can truly yield effective results in this regard is a powerful fleet, measures to aid China, and not diplomatic negotiations that may cause doubts about appeasement.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in the Taihang Mountains, Contacts Occur in the Damo Mountains and Tongshan, Chinese Launch Guerrilla Warfare Around Qingdao

Chongqing: Fierce fighting continues in the Taihang Mountains in southeastern Shanxi Province. The Chinese 98th and 27th Army units are currently fighting the Japanese army in the mountains north of the Yuanqu-Jiyuan highway and along both sides of the Tunliu-Gaoping highway. Chinese and Japanese artillery units are exchanging fire across the Yellow River every day. The Japanese army is currently attacking the Qiwu Mountains (phonetic) in southwestern Shanxi Province, south of the Fen River. A part of the Chinese army in the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi moved into the mountains three weeks ago after the Japanese army entered southern Shanxi. There is fighting in the Damo Mountains (phonetic) in southeastern Xianning, southern Hubei, and Tongshan (phonetic) in the northeast. The Chinese mobile units in the area use Tongshan as a base to control transportation in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces. The Japanese army launched an attack on the mountains on May 25 in an effort to clear out the Chinese forces in the mountains. (Reuters, 8th)

A Certain Location in Southern Shandong: The Chinese army recently launched a large-scale guerrilla war around Qingdao, achieving great success. The Boyu Prison and the so-called Shandong Salt Bureau in Qingdao were destroyed by the Chinese army last month. The garrison stationed on the island also took the opportunity to defect en masse. The Japanese naval and army forces in Qingdao gathered more than 1,000 men and launched repeated fierce attacks on the Chinese army, but were defeated. In recent days, the Japanese army has again gathered more than 3,000 men from Pingdu, Zhucheng, Gaomi, and Jiaoxian, with a detachment of marines, and launched fierce attacks on the northwest of Jimo and the southwest of Jiaoxian in several directions. The Chinese army fought back and forth fiercely more than ten times and was finally defeated. The Chinese army pursued and destroyed the Qingdao Baisha River Water Plant, capturing Japanese instructor Ichiyama Ichiro and others. In total, more than 1,500 Japanese soldiers were killed, more than 300 rifles, 5 machine guns, 1 heavy machine gun, 2 mountain guns, and a large amount of ammunition were seized, and Japanese commander Shirin and more than 10 Japanese soldiers were captured.

He immediately visited the disaster area in person to inspect and comfort the families of the victims.

On the 7th, he personally issued an order to dismiss and retain Liu Zhi, Hu Bohan, and Wu Guozhen. The original order is as follows: "It has been investigated that a tragic incident of asphyxiation occurred in a certain tunnel in the city on the evening of the 5th of this month, causing the death and injury of many civilians seeking refuge, which is deeply mourned. All responsible authorities cannot shirk their responsibility for negligence. Air Defense Commander Liu Zhi, Deputy Commander Hu Bohan, and Chongqing Mayor Wu Guozhen are hereby dismissed and retained, and each of the aforementioned officials is still charged with expediting the handling of relief matters and with immediately being responsible for improving protection equipment in order to seek future results.

### Japanese Disregard Vietnamese Governor's Protest, Illegally Transporting Goods from the United States in Vietnam; Five Large Ships, Estimated at Over 10,000 Tons, Have Been Transported; US Consul in Hanoi Has Reported the Details to the US Government

Hanoi: Japanese military officials today continued to load goods seized from warehouses in Haiphong on May 15th, ignoring repeated protests from the Vietnamese government since the Japanese military detained the goods. The French side has acknowledged that they are under pressure from the Japanese and unable to interfere. It is recalled that when the Japanese suddenly began confiscating the goods, Japanese military machine guns were deployed throughout the streets near the warehouses, and Japanese aircraft circled over Haiphong. The goods already transported by the Japanese include raw materials, metal sheets, freight cars, rubber tires, and machinery, totaling over 10,000 tons, divided into five large ships, and transported to Hainan Island. It is worth noting that the Japanese have consistently ignored suggestions from the original owners of all detained goods, asking the Vietnamese government to resolve the issue of the goods on their behalf. On May 25th, without stating the reason, the Japanese suddenly notified the original owners to hand over the keys to the warehouses. After the original owners handed over the keys to the French officials in Haiphong, the Japanese immediately began seizing the goods. It is reported that the US Consul in Hanoi, considering that the goods include those belonging to two American companies, Far East Trading Company and North American Company, has reported all the details to the US government. Since occupying Vietnam last year, the Japanese have insisted that the goods are military supplies destined for China and not the property of Americans. (8th United Press Telegram)

Hanoi: A certain Japanese news agency issued a message claiming that the French authorities in Haiphong Port had permitted the Japanese to detain a large quantity of military equipment and other goods stored there by the Chinese government. Local officials formally denied this today, stating that after discovering the Japanese plan to transport these goods, the Governor-General of Vietnam and the French government jointly lodged a serious protest with the Japanese military authorities, but the Japanese ignored it and proceeded to transport the goods themselves. The Vietnamese authorities are unaware of the destination of these goods. (7th Havas World News Agency Telegram)

### US Government to Resolve Labor Disputes: Army to Take Over Factories; Order Can Be Signed by President at Any Time; Final Advice to Workers Today

Washington: The nation and members of Congress are quite indignant about the frequent labor strikes in important industries. It is generally believed that while each soldier receives only four yuan per week, workers earn eight yuan per day and still strike for more, which is considered greedy and insatiable. It is heard that the heads of the army and navy are dissatisfied with the labor strikes. Although they do not wish to interfere with labor rights, they also do not want to see the production of war equipment, on which national security depends, being halted by labor strikes. President Roosevelt's delay in quelling the labor strikes is puzzling to many, with some believing that the president is letting labor commit evil and destroy itself. The Army Department has now initiated the drafting of an industry bill, the true purpose of which is to deal with labor. It is rumored that aircraft production in May was only slightly higher than in April due to labor strikes. Even if the labor strikes are resolved, production in June may not exceed that of May. If so, the plan to increase production to 20,000 aircraft this year will not be realized. Strikes in the shipbuilding industry are as harmful as those in the aircraft manufacturing industry. Presidential Secretary O'Reilly told people that the president hopes for a peaceful resolution of the labor strikes; otherwise, he will have to take over the industries. The president has invited the leader of the International Association of Machinists, Mr. Brown, to come to Washington to discuss the machinists' strike at the San Francisco shipyard. When asked about the Pacific Coast timber industry strike, O'Reilly replied that it was not a cause for concern because the timber supply was abundant. (8th Reuters Telegram)

Washington: President Roosevelt's Secretary O'Reilly said yesterday that the necessary documents have been prepared and can be signed at any time to allow the Army to take over and operate the North American Aviation factory during worker strikes. The president is traveling this weekend and is expected to return on Monday. If the strikers have not returned to work by then, the president will sign this document. (8th Reuters Telegram)

Washington: The United States currently has three major labor strikes that are sufficient to hinder the progress of national defense programs: one is the machinists' strike at the Bethelem shipyard on the West Coast, the second is the strike at the North American Aviation factory in Inglewood, California, and the third is the strike of forestry workers in Washington State. The US Production Management Bureau has issued a notice to the striking workers, advising them to return to work. It is reported that President Roosevelt is also scheduled to make a final appeal to the striking workers on Monday. If they continue to strike, the government will take strict measures to end the strikes. (7th Havas Telegram)

Washington: The strike at North American Aviation in Inglewood, California, has lasted for three days, halting the production of $1,910,000,000 worth of British and American aircraft. The White House announced yesterday that President Roosevelt has decided to confiscate and take over the company's factory if the workers do not return to work on Sunday. He is currently examining the legal issues of this action with officials. The document for taking over the factory has already been drafted. President's Secretary O'Reilly said that the president will postpone action until the United Auto Workers union meets on Sunday and will study the situation on Sunday night. On Monday morning, he will sign the document ordering the Army to take over and manage the factory. The President's approach should not be regarded as a threat to the workers. The President insists that national defense projects cannot be stopped again due to strikes. The President is giving the workers an opportunity to decide for themselves. If the Army takes over the factory, all workers will have the right to return to work. This statement indicates that the Army will guard the factory and repel the workers' pickets so that non-striking workers can enter and work. (8th United Press Telegram)

Washington: According to sources close to the White House, President Roosevelt has decided to take firm measures to crack down on the strike at the North American Aviation factory in Inglewood, California. It is said that President Roosevelt will declare a state of national emergency in accordance with the recently announced state of national emergency and announce the government's takeover of the factory. (8th Haitong Telegram)

New York: According to reliable news here yesterday, regarding the strike at the North American Aviation factory in Inglewood, California, the workers will continue the strike regardless of President Roosevelt's threat to take over the factory if their demands are not accepted. It is expected here that President Roosevelt will sign an order to confiscate the factory on Monday. (8th Haitong Telegram)

Detroit: According to Ford Motor Company's announcement, the aircraft engine factory will soon be completed and is expected to begin production by the end of this month. According to the original plan, it can produce 15 engines per day. The government has requested that production be increased threefold to 40 engines per day, which requires the construction of a new factory. (7th Havas Telegram)

Washington: News here yesterday stated that senior administrative officials are seeking to use President Wilson's World War I law, "Work or Fight," as a model for resolving this strike case, and are requesting President Roosevelt to dismiss striking workers from national defense factories. Officials believe that President Roosevelt will take such measures in the conscription law. (8th United Press Telegram)

### Japan Still Yearns to Improve Relations with the US; It Is Widely Believed That the US Ambassador's Visit to Matsuoka May Have Revealed This Intention

Tokyo: Political observers expressed their opinion today that US Ambassador to Tokyo Joseph Grew's recent visit to Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka may be a prelude to the initiation of negotiations between the US and Japan to improve relations. People are paying such attention to the conversation between the two because they met immediately following Japanese Ambassador to the US Nomura's declaration. According to Nomura, Japan has not abandoned hope of improving relations despite difficulties. It is also worth noting that this matter occurred after Secretary of State Hull's response last Wednesday regarding the continued shipment of large quantities of raw materials from the United States to Japan and the Soviet Union. This answer by Hull to inquiries was considered by many quarters in the United States and Japan as a defense by Washington of its recent policy of not imposing a complete economic blockade on Japan so as not to provoke Japan. "The Japan Times and Advertiser" recently published a commentary discussing the situation in the Pacific, revealing Japan's desire to improve US-Japan relations. The newspaper said that Ambassador Nomura stated in his speech that although he has collected various information since arriving in the United States, his confidence in a peaceful resolution of disputes in the Pacific has not diminished. He believes that "if both sides can show goodwill, especially if the United States does not take actions that would force Japan to fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite Pact, then the goal of friendship between the two countries can be achieved." The newspaper said that the American people, having obtained the frank and hopeful verbal guarantee of General Nomura, will be able to obtain powerful tools to promote cooperation between the government and the Japanese government. "Kokumin Shimbun," a nationalist extremist newspaper that often reflects the views of the military, said that if the United States truly wants to improve US-Japan relations, Washington should abandon its anti-Japanese actions, including aid to Chongqing. "Kokumin Shimbun" argued that the Tripartite Pact is not aimed at the United States, but only to prevent the United States from entering the European war. (8th United Press Telegram)

Japan May Not Dare to Break with the US

Washington: Sims, foreign affairs editor of the Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance, wrote in the newspaper yesterday, claiming that the delay between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in avoiding a rupture is considered by Washington as an indication that Japan, at least for the present, does not want to create a crisis with the United States. Sims's article stated, "After months of negotiations, the Japanese side declared that if the Dutch East Indies could not provide a satisfactory answer by noon on Friday, the consequences would be serious. Although the current outcome is not yet known, the deadline has passed, and there has been no eruption. The seriousness of this dispute has not diminished, and Japanese warlords have not indicated that they have abandoned their ambition to invade the island. This invasion will trigger a new war in the Pacific, and the United States may also join it. Many people in Japan and the United States feel that a US-Japan war is unavoidable, but a large and influential group of Americans and Japanese believe that a US-Japan war can be avoided and will be avoided no matter how difficult. Among those who hold this view are President Roosevelt, Yosuke Matsuoka, and Kichisaburo Nomura. Although reports that the US and Japan had negotiated a non-aggression pact have been denied, it can be stated with certainty that Hull and Nomura have explored ways to improve mutual understanding. Some people in Japan believe that Nomura's main mission in the US is to delay the inevitable moment. Other Japanese believe that a war will cause both Japan and the US to suffer, while the Communists will benefit. Therefore, leaders in Tokyo sent Nomura to the US to find a way to avoid war, but this is difficult to find because the United States has a strong policy on the war in China. The United States has no intention of abandoning China and cannot accept Japan's dominance of India, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. Therefore, the crisis between Japan and the Dutch East Indies will involve the United States." (8th United Press Telegram)

### Japan Still Willing to Reach Compromise with Dutch East Indies; Negotiations Between Both Parties Will Not Result in Rupture

Tokyo: Responsible sources here say that although newspapers are pessimistic about the negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, the government is determined to reach a compromise with the Dutch East Indies government. However, whether Japan's "greatest and final effort" has any hope of success will be clear within a few days. At present, there will be no immediate rupture between the two parties. Yoshizawa, the chief Japanese representative in the Dutch East Indies, yesterday reported to the government on the latest negotiations, including the Dutch East Indies' response to various Japanese proposals. Foreign Minister Matsuoka is scheduled to convene a meeting of foreign ministry officials and experts today to study them in order to issue new instructions to Yoshizawa, requesting the Dutch East Indies authorities to revise certain points in the answer and to clarify certain sections whose meaning is ambiguous and conflicting with the Japanese proposal. (7th Havas Telegram)

Tokyo: The Japanese government is currently studying the Dutch East Indies government's response to the Japanese proposals. According to well-informed sources, the government is currently discussing the stubborn attitude of the Dutch East Indies with various responsible parties. Local newspapers are severely criticizing the attitude of the Dutch East Indies, hoping that the authorities will break with it. All newspapers believe that even if negotiations continue, they will not be able to change the situation. (8th Haitong Telegram)

Washington: It was learned yesterday that several defense officials told Congress that the United States must maintain the supply line to the Dutch East Indies "at all costs." Congress learned in a closed-door meeting that certain raw materials are currently in short supply, especially rubber, so some non-defense rubber tires have to be used. (8th International News Service Telegram)

Tokyo: Five prominent Japanese newspapers today attacked the authorities in the Dutch East Indies, saying that the failure of the final conditions proposed by the Japanese side in the recent business negotiations held in Batavia to receive a satisfactory response was due to the unfriendly attitude of the Dutch East Indies authorities. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper called on the government to suspend negotiations, saying that the Dutch East Indies' tough attitude was due to its reliance on Britain and the United States. Regarding this point, it is known that the joint defense plan between Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands has been practically completed. The newspaper pointed out that the Dutch have strengthened their defenses, especially because they have received assistance from the United States. The Asahi Shimbun said that the Japanese government should prepare a far-reaching new policy to deal with the Dutch East Indies. The other newspapers that made similar comments were the Nichinichi Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, Hochi Shimbun, and Miyako Shimbun. (6th United Press Telegram)

### Hoover Emphasizes Air Power; Urges American Scientific Community to Study Carefully

Haverford: Former Republican President Herbert Hoover declared last night while speaking to the graduating class of Haverford College that science should produce a response to military aircraft, adding, "If such a response can be realized and realized soon, it can transform the entire destiny of the world." Hoover expressed regret that the funds used for scientific research in the United States were so small. He said, "We will spend 20 billion US dollars annually for military equipment. If we can use one percent of this amount for research, we can recover some of the losses after the war." Hoover also said, "Aircraft have reformed war and made aggressors more powerful, while making smaller countries unable to defend their freedom, and the massacre of women and children has become part of the war. The world has not yet invented a method of defense. Aircraft are produced by physical science, so the method of defense may also come from it. Therefore, we must study it."

### Rear Admiral Yarnell Declares That the US Must Fight Now; US Should Adopt Realistic Self-Defense Policy in the Pacific and Atlantic

Hoboken: Former Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet Rear Admiral Yarnell stated in a speech last night that the United States must fight now if it thinks of maintaining its freedom and democratic way of life. He also said that the United States does not need to send a distant army to Britain but advocated adopting a strong and realistic self-defense policy in the Atlantic and Pacific. He also said that fourteen months ago, he claimed that the United States should remain above the war to the extent possible, but he pointed out that at present, "isolation" has become "a name of the past. If we think of preserving our freedom and democratic system, we should fight for them, and we should fight immediately while the US and Britain are still a powerful alliance."

### Shipping Between US and South America Currently Feels Shortage of Vessels; Reason Is Due to Navy Department Requisitioning Ships, Resulting in Delays in Transshipment of Various Raw Materials

New York: The US Navy Department's requisitioning of US ships has led to a shortage of vessels in shipping between the United States and South America. The use of ships from Axis countries should ease this situation somewhat. South American warehouses are currently full of goods waiting to be shipped to the United States. According to the New York Journal of Commerce, the transshipment of important raw materials from South America and the Far East, such as tin, antimony, tungsten, manganese, rubber, and copper, is delayed due to a lack of ships. It is expected that the authorities will use some of the seized foreign ships to transport these necessary items. (8th Reuters Telegram)

### British Troops Cross the Womo River and Capture Abalti; Nearly 1,000 Ethiopian Troops Captured

Cairo: Official circles claim that British troops in Abyssinia have crossed the Womo River and captured Abalti. The Womo River is 50 feet wide and lies below a vast plain. Ethiopian troops were entrenched on the high banks west of the river, a strategically advantageous position, but British African troops braved heavy artillery fire, forced a crossing, scaled the high banks, and cleared out enemy outposts, capturing 1,000 enemy soldiers.

European War Chat (62)
The Severity of the Atlantic War

U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt recently delivered a historic "fireside chat," stating that German submarines and aircraft were sinking merchant ships at a rate three times higher than Britain's replacement rate and twice as high as the combined shipbuilding rate of Britain and the United States. This shows the severity of the Atlantic war.

In the past twelve months, Britain lost a total of 4,158,986 tons of ships, including cargo worth a total of US$145,564,510 and ships valued at approximately US$1,500,000,000. From the beginning of the war to the end of April this year, Britain and its allies lost more than 1,000 ships, totaling 5,651,481 tons, with cargo and ships valued at US$1,893,246,135. At the start of the war, Britain had over 12,000,000 tons of seagoing ships exceeding 1,000 tons, which has now been reduced to 7,000,000 tons. However, according to estimates by "The Economist" magazine in London, Britain has acquired 8,000,000 tons of ships from Norway and other countries. As a result, Britain currently has 15,000,000 tons of ships. (German ships sunk totaled 1,800,000 tons, and Italian ships sunk totaled 1,200,000 tons, totaling 3,000,000 tons).

At the outset of this European war, Britain possessed 21,000,000 tons of various merchant ships "Note 1". It subsequently obtained 9,000,000 tons from allied and neutral countries, plus 3,000,000 tons from manufacturing, purchasing, leasing, and seizures, bringing the total to 33,000,000 tons. Based on common sense, after deducting the 530 tons lost, Britain should still have 27,700,000 tons remaining.

However, this number is inflated and unrealistic. A large portion has been requisitioned by the Admiralty for transporting troops and supplies to the Mediterranean and for use as escort patrols. Many merchant ships are also unsuitable for transport work, such as river vessels, ferries in the English Channel, and passenger ships with small cargo holds. In addition, many ships are assigned to special uses and cannot travel long distances. Therefore, the actual tonnage of ships used to transport military supplies and food to Britain is only 13,000,000 tons.

Secondly, the sailing speed has been reduced compared to the past. During escort missions, all ships can only use the speed of the slowest ship as the standard, and they must take winding routes, which take twice as long as usual. The transport capacity of these 13,000,000 tons of merchant ships is therefore only equivalent to 6,500,000 tons in normal times.

Furthermore, among all British ports, only Liverpool, Clyde, and Severn are able to be fully utilized. Edinburgh, Newcastle, Hull, London, and Southampton have gradually lost their original positions under concentrated attacks by German submarines and aircraft, further reducing the effective use of approximately 5,000,000 tons of merchant ships.

The reality is even worse. Shipyards are often filled with 1,000,000 tons of ships with heavy or light damage waiting for repairs. One-quarter of this damage is due to normal navigation, while the rest is the result of German destruction. Thus, shipyards are facing a situation where they urgently need to build new ships and warships while constantly repairing existing ships, creating a severe shortage of resources.

Due to these various reasons, although Britain nominally has 17,700,000 tons of merchant ships, only 4,000,000 tons are actually available for transporting overseas supplies during wartime. Since March this year, British merchant ship losses have averaged 100,000 tons per week "Note 2". At this rate, annual losses will reach 5,000,000 tons or more. Assuming the highest shipbuilding rate for Britain and the United States this year is 1,100,000 tons, Britain will suffer a net loss of 2,000,000 tons, equivalent to 22% of the current transport fleet (13,000,000 tons). The actual tonnage will also decrease to just over 3,000,000 tons. If this continues, it is difficult to see how it will end.

During the last European war, Britain was quite successful in dealing with submarines. After British merchant ship losses broke all records in April 1917 (totaling 394,700 tons), the establishment of a military convoy system proved highly effective. From 1917 to 1918, Atlantic convoys safely reached their destinations at a rate of 99.08%. British destroyers were highly skilled in searching for and sinking enemy submarines. By the end of the war, destroyers had a 30% success rate in hitting targets with depth charges, but since the start of this European war, due to different circumstances, the results have not been as impressive.

First, the ratio of German offensive power to British defensive power is vastly different now compared to then. At the end of the last European war, Britain still had 496 destroyers and could obtain 100 from the United States, 92 from France, and 67 from Italy, totaling 755 ships. The situation is different in this war. As of late April this year, Britain had just over 200 destroyers, including 50 transferred from the United States and several dozen old-fashioned medium-sized cruisers. In the spring of 1917, Germany's submarine strength was only 128, but this spring, it is at least 180, or possibly even more. Thus, Germany's offensive power has increased by more than half compared to before, while Britain's defensive power is less than half of what it used to be.

As for Britain using battleships for escort, although it provides some assistance, it is ultimately a losing proposition. During the last European war, the German fleet was a formidable force, and British battleships had to concentrate in Singapore Bay to prevent German ships from encircling and attacking. In this war, with Germany's limited number of battleships and Italy's fleet proving to be weak "Note 3," Britain has been able to disperse its fleet for escort duties. However, battleships are not as fast as destroyers and cannot pursue submarines; they can only deter enemy raiding ships.

From 1917 to 1918, Britain only needed to guard the Dover Strait and the area between Scotland and Norway in the North Sea to prevent German submarines from entering. The entire blockade line was only 300 nautical miles long. By the end of the war, the entire line was heavily mined. This time, Germany has occupied Norway and most of the French coast, with a coastline stretching 2,300 nautical miles from Narvik, Norway, to Bayonne, France. Germany can freely choose its attack bases, making it difficult for Britain to defend against.

Things Seen, Heard, and Thought

June is typically a slow month for Shanghai. Even during extraordinary times, it inevitably suffers from regular seasonal effects. In the ebb and flow of speculation, it appears all the more desolate.

Everyone probably remembers: after the May 2nd storm last year, there was a June panic. At that time, the price of gold plummeted by 1,000 yuan in ten days (from 6,494 yuan on the 3rd to 5,200 yuan on the 11th). Each package of twenty Double Horse cigarettes dropped by more than 600 yuan (from 1,45 yuan on the 4th to 805 yuan on the 14th). Foreign stocks also plunged by 50-60 yuan to 200-300 yuan each.

History does not repeat itself, but seasons are cyclical. Look: this kind of seasonal panic phenomenon began at the end of May. Both gold and yarn prices are gradually declining. Perhaps because the lingering fear of last year remains, most speculators have to take precautions in advance?

I heard that the recent sharp drop in yarn prices, in addition to seasonal influences, has a special reason. That is, a certain exchange is opening its doors to welcome guests with gifts. It is using price reductions to attract customers. This is the same as encouraging military ticket speculation, deliberately creating a trend to attract speculators' attention to help the issue of tickets. Moreover, customer groups often choose the cheaper options when importing yarn; lowering prices also appeals to popular sentiment. This method could not be more ingenious.

However, price reductions and dumping cause losses for oneself. But implementing dumping on the exchange market is a bit like being generous at the expense of others. But in all fairness, current yarn prices are still too high, not enough to be called "discounted." The so-called "discount" here refers only to another Double Horse market.

Since the soaring grain prices, labor disputes have spread to all industries. The only exception is the rice industry. They have consistently cooperated with each other, which is truly commendable. But this time, at the beginning of the Municipal Council's cheap rice entering the market and bringing rice prices back to normal, an unprecedented "non-cooperation" trend suddenly occurred among rice merchants. Fortunately, the Municipal Council handled it properly, and work soon resumed. But what their intentions are cannot help but make people suspicious. I recently heard that the Municipal Council is mediating the situation, and I think the Municipal Council will not fall for their tricks.

County and Township Financial Restructuring
Li Yibing

New-style financial institutions in our country are not only geographically concentrated in the coastal provinces' major cities, but their business activities also primarily target urban commercial and industrial enterprises. Moreover, due to other unbalanced developments in the national economy, the phenomenon of surplus capital being concentrated has intensified. Cities are constantly congested with large amounts of floating capital that cannot be absorbed, while the vast counties and townships suffer from severe anemia.

Although, a few years before the war, the banking industry in Shanghai enthusiastically promoted the slogan of capital returning to the countryside, making efforts to expand the establishment of branch offices and actively promoting the handling of agricultural loans, the results were minimal. On the surface, the number of bank branch offices has indeed increased, but the areas of distribution are still limited to small cities with thriving commerce. And although the main business is centered on agricultural loans, the short time frame, small amounts, and not-very-correct lending targets have not fulfilled the real task of regulating civilian finance. It has even led to local commercial capital colluding to become blood-sucking vessels of county and township finance, absorbing the financial power of the counties and townships and gathering it like myriad streams returning to the sea in the big cities to "float." This so-called "local economic balance and safekeeping authority" is clearly not something that ordinary banks can reliably achieve.

Originally, ordinary private banks are profit-making enterprises, so naturally their business expansion must be based on the premise of enterprise profits. The nature of capital is originally like water: water flows downwards, and capital always flows to places with higher interest rates. The targets of county and township finance are mainly agricultural credit with lower profit growth rates and longer terms. Even the industrial and commercial credit transactions of local small industries and local transportation organizations are generally limited by the production environment, and their profits can never be equated with speculative transactions in big cities. The lending purchase limits cannot be as agile and active as short-term commercial credit in cities. Therefore, the concentration of new-style banks in cities is a natural result. Because private financial businesses cannot abandon their profit-making principles and cannot ignore the limitations of time and place in their own capital movements, they naturally cannot provide sufficient county and township loans at low interest rates and for longer periods.

From an operational perspective, county and township finance mainly involves many small-amount deposits and withdrawals, making the manual procedures cumbersome and complicated. Moreover, based on past experience in handling agricultural loans, the general population in counties and townships is not good at using new-style financial institutions, and the new-style financial institutions have not improved the cumbersome procedures. Therefore, most people's financing needs are still held in the hands of private high-interest lenders and pawnshops. According to a survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute before the war, the sources of farmers' loans were mainly individuals, shops, and pawnshops, accounting for more than 89%. The financing of general shops is mostly within the domain of money shops. As for the newly established credit cooperatives, not only are there few in number and their geographical distribution is narrow, but undeniably many of them are in the hands of local tyrants and evil gentry, becoming new tools for exploitation. The actual production teams in counties and townships still have to live under the exploitation of high interest rates of 3-5% or more.

The situation before the war was like this, so what is the actual situation of county and township finance after the war? Since the war first broke out in the coastal areas, financial institutions temporarily retreated to the rear, and voices for internal migration of capital and development of the southwest rose loudly. However, according to the actual performance over the past four years, apart from government banks, not many private banks have established branch offices in the interior. Those that have truly completely retreated to the rear are certainly as rare as stars at dawn. Even among the few banks that have migrated internally from Shanghai, the general direction of their business is still mostly hesitant and wait-and-see, only putting up a facade as decoration. As for the issue of internal migration of capital, just look at the exchange rate between the major rear areas in the interior and Shanghai, which has consistently shown a reverse trend since the war, with the exchange rate getting higher day by day, and the fact that the deposit amounts in Shanghai's banking industry continue to increase and floating capital is rampant, churning with unprecedented speculative tides. This can serve as an excellent illustration.

However, in the few years after the war, the government did make efforts to adjust agriculture and local finance, planning various new facilities and programs. It promised that the construction of the agricultural financial system, the promotion of credit cooperatives, the expansion of agricultural loans, and the improvement of local finance would have very progressive performance and achieve a considerable foundation. This is the only exciting fact when discussing the current state of county and township finance.

The above is a brief review of the position of county and township finance in the entire financial industry, and it can be seen how deeply the power of finance has been biased in the past. Conversely, it is not difficult to imagine the pathological state of China's financial industry's abnormal development in the coastal areas and cities. This is neither the way to build a sound national finance nor is it beneficial to wartime national policies.

The foundation of a nation's wealth lies in materials. If the production of materials can be expanded, and the rate of re-production turnover can be increased, the accumulation of national wealth will naturally also increase. This is true in peacetime, but in wartime, due to the fierce destruction of war and the large increase in military consumption, the need for material replenishment is all the more urgent. However, to actively promote production and expand the production field, one cannot be separated from the foundation of material storage - the vast county and township areas. The three conditions of production are land, labor, and capital. With the vast land, abundant labor, fertile land, and abundant reserves in China's county and township areas, there are extremely excellent natural endowments, but they cannot be without the element of capital. Therefore, the construction of county and township finance can be said to be a prerequisite for national production and economic construction, and its importance is easy to imagine.

Secondly, we talk about the issue of the main body responsible for undertaking the task of establishing county and township finance.

As mentioned above, private banks are limited by the desire for their own enterprise profits and hindered by the normal rules of their own capital movements, so they naturally cannot fully take on the entirety of this task. Taking agricultural credit as an example, in European and American countries, either the government participates in capital and provides financial assistance, or they mostly have a unified central organization that is directly protected, assisted, and supervised by the government. Therefore, the main body for the construction of county and township finance should be publicly owned, especially in our country where the foundation is weak.

However, given the vastness of China's county and township areas, it is certainly impossible for the government's capital alone to universally establish a financial network in the counties and townships. Therefore, from the perspective of promoting county and township financial institutions and their sources of funding, we feel that the existing local financial organizations and the inherent wealth of the local area are indeed a major cornerstone of creation.

From an overall perspective, county and township finance is indeed greatly deficient. However, firstly, the government's efforts to promote agricultural finance and the initial scale of credit cooperation in recent years are all helpful for the creation. Secondly, the existence of local banks and native silver firms in various provinces, these original local financial organizations, are all important foundations for promoting county and township financial institutions. However, because they lacked a strict system in the past and did not have a strong and powerful central organization, some were limited by their own weak capital and could not independently develop their business, while others were poorly managed and human schemes were reduced, leading to the organization being scattered. In addition, the lack of profit guarantees for capital investment often caused them to hesitate and even distort the mission they should have undertaken. Therefore, if we examine it from the two aspects of organization and capital, we believe that the original local financial institutions can be utilized, but they must be thoroughly reorganized, especially in merging organizations, so as to concentrate capital, unify steps, and add the assistance of the central organization to promote business and protect business interests. Strict supervision of business is more effective than building a new stove on top of a bed.

As for the source of funds, the local financial organizations themselves have considerable capital, which can be used for local production undertakings in a unified step. Even if there are poor counties and townships, the central organization can invest appropriately. Moreover, due to the expansion of business, the absorption of deposits, the encouragement of savings, and the transformation of dead capital in the counties and townships, all can be regarded as the main sources. To put it a little further, the development of county and township production undertakings is enough to increase the savings power of the general public, and due to the high prices of agricultural products after the war, the current savings power of rural areas is far from comparable to that before the war. This is another excellent opportunity to create county and township finance at present.

To truly achieve the development of local industries with local capital, we can truly realize the "local economic balance and safekeeping authority" to curb the pathological development of capital concentration in cities. To achieve balanced development of capital in all counties and townships, the bias of finance and institutions can be naturally corrected. This is not only of great significance to the promotion of production and balanced prices during wartime, but also an important foundation for the future of national construction.

Recently, the Ministry of Finance created County and Township Banks, which is a great plan mainly aimed at utilizing local capital to develop local wealth and assist the original financial institutions in the counties and townships. The head office has been established in Chongqing, with a total capital of 20 million national currency.

The significance of the establishment of the bank and its importance in wartime and construction have been described in detail above. Now, let's briefly review the three aspects of the bank's organization, business, and management.

In terms of organization, County and Township Banks do not adopt the general branch office system, but rather a bank with the nature of a parent company. It only participates in part of the capital of the County and Township Banks in each province and sets up offices in each province to engage in guidance.

In principle, the local County and Township Banks are reorganized from the original financial organizations in various places, so they cannot lose their organizational independence and adopt a branch office system. However, the single bank system has great loopholes in management due to the lack of subordination and connection. Therefore, the County and Township Bank adopts the system of a parent company with an enterprise organizational form in its organization, which is originally a compromise method. However, in view of the past scattered and weak local finance and the fact that business operations have not been on track, we believe that at least two points should be paid attention to in the current organization: First, the power and determination of government control should be used to merge the local financial institutions into a unified organizational structure to enhance the use of capital and talents, and to overcome the ills of scattered power and loose organization. Second, in the application of the organizational system, guidance is not enough, but effective and direct management should be adopted to enhance the effectiveness of enterprise management, so that business management has a strong subordination relationship, which is conducive to the correctness, agility, and effectiveness of business promotion.

Silk Cocoon News and Knowledge
—Teaching Material for "Commercial News" from the School of Commerce, Shanghai University—

Before the war, Shanghai's silk merchants would suddenly get busy around this time. Now, they can only watch the Japanese get busy. This is the biggest wartime feature of China's silk industry, but other than that, general matters related to the silk industry are no different.

Our country is the homeland of the world's silk industry, but now it has been overtaken by Japan, Italy, France, and other latecomers. However, our country has a vast production area and cheap labor, so as long as we catch up quickly, it is not difficult to recover lost ground.

Cocoon
Silkworm species are generally divided into Chinese species, Japanese species, and Italian species. Chinese silkworm cocoons are oval and large, while Japanese species are thin in the middle and oval at both ends. In terms of color, they are divided into white and yellow. Yellow cocoons are easy to feed, but the output is poor, while white cocoons are the mainstay of the silk industry. In addition, there are so-called "double cocoons," that is, two silkworms combine to form one cocoon. The silk threads of double cocoons are disordered and must be reeled with special machines.

The grade of the cocoon is determined by color, shape, silk quantity, unwinding, dryness, and impurities. The amount of silk is the most important. The average weight of each cocoon is from 1.8 to 2.4 millimeters, the amount of silk layer accounts for 19%, and the amount of silk accounts for 14%. However, due to the different types of silkworms, the silk yield is not consistent. For high-quality Chinese silkworm cocoons, one dan of raw cocoons can yield one dan of silk. European species can produce one jin of silk per twelve jin, while Japanese species can produce one jin of silk per sixteen jin.

Silkworm Species
Before the war, the Chinese government had already paid attention to the improvement of cocoon species and had designated the following excellent original silkworm species:

Univoltine species include Hang Gui, Qia Gui, Xi Qia, Xi Qiao, Xi Hao, Dong Geng, Hua Gui No. 1, Hua Gui No. 2, etc.

Bivoltine species include Hua Wu, Hua Liu, Hua Qi, Ying Zhen, etc.

The so-called univoltine means spring silkworms with one generation per year, while bivoltine means summer and autumn silkworms with two generations (i.e., two harvests) per year. According to eugenics, crossbreeding is often used to improve silkworm species. According to test results, the following hybrid species have the best performance: Hang Gui and Hua Wu, Hang Gui and Hua Liu, Hua Liu and Xi Qiao, Hua Wu and Xi Qia, Xi Hao and Qia Gui, Dong Geng and Qia Gui, Qia Gui and Hua Liu, Ying Zhen and Hua Qi, Hua Gui No. 1 and Hua Liu.

Cocoon Market
Fresh cocoons are listed in two periods: spring and autumn. Spring cocoons are the most important, followed by autumn cocoons. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, spring cocoons are listed from mid-May to early June, lasting only about two weeks. Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, Huzhou in Zhejiang and Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yixing, Dongting Mountain, Jiangyin, Liyang, etc. in Jiangsu are all important markets. Shanghai silk factories send personnel to set up offices to collect cocoons, and there are cocoon firms locally that collect cocoons to sell to silk factories.

Cocoon Price
The quality of the cocoons is the deciding factor in the price of cocoons. Cocoons with broken shells and dirty cocoons are calculated as waste cocoon prices and cannot be compared with the prices of clean and complete cocoons.

The second factor that constitutes the cocoon price is the silk price. In theory, the silk price is the sum of the cocoon price and the silk reeling labor price. Therefore, subtracting the labor price from the silk price is the price of the raw cocoons. So, the general formula for evaluating cocoon prices is:

The formula commonly used for assessing cocoon prices in Japan is called "Kake," which calculates that the cocoon price should account for 16% of the price per 16 kwan (each kwan weighs 6.25 Japanese kin, totaling 100 Japanese kin), so the formula is:

Since the cocoon price is based on the silk price, the cocoon price must be low when the silk price is low. This connection often causes losses for silkworm farmers. Because silkworm farmers have to pay not only wages but also mulberry leaf prices. If mulberry leaves are expensive and cocoons are cheap, there is a risk of loss. The reason why China's silk industry has declined in recent years is that Japanese silk dumping has led to a sharp drop in world silk prices, resulting in a drop in cocoon prices, making silkworm farmers unprofitable, so they have given up this industry. Therefore, calculating cocoon prices based on silk prices is not a good way to encourage silkworm farming.

Packaging and Unit
Cocoon packaging varies depending on the distance of transportation. Usually, burlap bags are used and placed in bamboo baskets. Rotten cocoons are placed in burlap bags and strapped with iron bars. The pupae must be killed before packaging. Each package weighs approximately 100 jin, and the asking price is also calculated by the dan. Retail transactions are calculated by the jin.

Raw Silk Names
(1) White Local Silk, (2) Yellow Local Silk, both reeled by local methods. (3) White Silk Warp, also known as Huache Qianjing, also known as Pingche Dajing: Zhejiang Huzhou's Jili white silk warp belongs to this category. This is the goods reeled from local silk. (4) Yellow Silk Warp, which is goods reeled from yellow local silk. (5) White Mill Warp, (6) Yellow Mill Warp, both machine-reeled. (7) Gray Silk Warp, that is, wild silkworm silk, also known as tussah silk. There are eight-cocoon gray warp, large-frame gray warp, and small-frame gray warp. This refers to the number of cocoons combined to reel each silk warp. For example, eight-cocoon gray warp means that one silk warp is composed of eight cocoons. (8) Dou Gong Silk, that is, silk reeled from double cocoons or so-called double cocoons.

Raw Silk Grades
Chinese silk grades are roughly divided into high grade, superior grade, medium grade, and inferior grade. Japanese silk is divided into special grade AAA, AAA, AA, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, etc. The New York silk market is divided into GXXS, GXX, XXS, Cr.XX, XX, Best, and Extra seven grades. The grades are determined by fineness, uniformity, clarity, strength, elongation, and cohesion. The special unit is indicated by denier per strip. For each silk strip, roughly 5 strips of denier are combined to form 14 denier, and 7 strips of 3 denier are combined to form 11 denier. The so-called denier is a unit that is 450 meters long (the international unit is 900 meters) and weighs 0.05 millimeters. For example, 2 denier is 450 meters long and weighs 1 millimeter (i.e., 20 times 0.05 millimeters). Since the grade is based on weight as a unit, the fineness per strip is closely related to the grade. Usually, 30/32 strips are the largest, and 9/11 strips are the smallest. Uniformity grade A is above 85 points, and grade B is above 80 points.

Raw Silk Packaging
Chinese silk packaging, for domestic sales, is roughly one dan per piece; for export sales, there are large warp and mouth warp. Large warp weighs 160 pounds per package, divided into 20 bundles; each bundle weighs 8 pounds, divided into 15 skeins. Mouth warp weighs 135 pounds per package, divided into 15 bundles, each bundle divided into 40 to 50 skeins. Japanese silk packaging has two types: marukan and sixteen kwan. The former weighs 58 Japanese kin, and the latter weighs 100 Japanese kin (i.e., 132.275 pounds). The transaction price deducts the tare weight and checks the net weight for calculation. The so-called net weight is to check whether there is water and obtain the dry net weight.

Asking Price Unit
Chinese silk is calculated per dan; Japanese silk spot is per 100 Japanese kin in Japanese yen; spot is per 100 Japanese kin in Japanese yen, New York per pound in US dollars; Lyon per kilo in French francs; London per pound in shillings; Milan per kilo in Italian lira. The formula for converting New York silk prices to legal currency is:

The formula for converting London silk prices to legal currency is:

The formula for converting Lyon silk prices to legal currency is:

The so-called additional fees include transportation fees, freight, and insurance fees. Before the war, each dan cost about 40 yuan. (Zhang Yifan)

White-skinned Bitter Almonds Show Upturn

The market for bitter almonds has tightened slightly recently. The quoted price for white-skinned bitter almonds once rose to 96. Dealers are quoting 100 yuan. Red-skinned goods are quoted at 90 yuan, and dealers are quoting 95 yuan. The trend is stable.

Cigarette Sales Are Active

Cigarette market: Because factories have changed wooden boxes to cardboard boxes, the market has become increasingly tight. At present, general hoarders, feeling the weather getting warmer, are coming out of the woodwork. Customer groups have been shipping out in large quantities in recent days because most of the certificates (removal permits) issued to the military in various places have been obtained and are waiting to be shipped, and sales on this street are also smooth, causing prices to remain strong. For example, Old Knife brand is 944 yuan, and holders are watching the market to sell. Another example is Five Flowers brand at 687 yuan, Little Fairy brand at 671 yuan, Great Britain brand at 1,297 yuan, and Pin Hai brand at 871 yuan, all with no honor or disgrace.

Black Steel Billets Rise by 100 Yuan

The transaction of black steel billets has been quite lively recently. Because factories on this street cannot find enough, the total daily transaction volume is always in the range of 30-40 bundles. The market situation is therefore lively, and people's hearts are also rising. I heard that yesterday's market price rose again to about 100 yuan, with each bundle of 2,000 pounds selling for 3,400 yuan. At present, because overseas sources are not continuing, and the local stock is insufficient, the trend of daily searching for goods is very strong. The market atmosphere is invigorated, and the thoughts of those in the industry are getting higher. It is feared that the market price in the future will be difficult to look small.

Our Nails Still Stagnant

The market for our factory's original nails, which has not improved for a long time, still feels sluggish. Because the business of customers from other ports is not moving, and the actual sales on this street are limited, it is difficult for the market to turn around. People's hearts are tired, and the opening price still hovers around 160 yuan.

Beans and Cloth Shipped to Hong Kong

Exported goods on the 8th included 700 bags of beans and 145 pieces of tea to Hong Kong, 130 pieces of cloth, and 88 pieces of cloth to Yangon, 500 pieces of tea to Tianjin.

Cotton

Gao Jiannong

Gao Bujian, a poet of the early Qing Dynasty, has a poem about seeking the old site of the Huangmu Temple at night in Wujing: "Fiber from the barbarian land, now planted here in abundance: woven to provide for the people, modeled after Huang Po... "Now, let's borrow these few lines as my opening remarks when talking about cotton.

This so-called "cotton," a plant that is so common that it is well-known to every household, is actually a genuine foreign product! Its original name was also certainly not cotton. If the Yu Gong chapter of the Book of Documents is truly a credible historical material, and if later commentators interpret the "shells" of the tribute from Yangzhou, "islanders offer woven clothing, their baskets of shells," as "the finest of tree cotton," it truly does not lose its original meaning. Then, the true name of cotton should be the "shells" that the islanders call it: or, even more credibly and reliably, it should be the "kapok" mentioned in Li Yanshou's History of the Southern Dynasties, Biography of the Kingdom of Lin Yi. Xu Wending Gong said it well in the Complete Book of Agricultural Administration: "The name of kapok first appeared in the History of the Southern Dynasties... I don't know its meaning, it is probably a foreign language from overseas." That's right, the two words "kapok" are indeed the name of the cotton plant called by the Kingdom of Lin Yi, by the barbarians: this matter is not only stated by the famous Song Dynasty monk Fayun in his Collection of Translated Meanings: "Kapok, that is, tree cotton..." providing it with an ironclad case that is absolutely difficult to overturn based on genuine linguistics; I myself have also extensively visited several foreign clergy who are proficient in many languages, hoping to trace the source and find the true meaning of the two words "kapok." The result is that the word for cotton in Indian languages is indeed "Rirpas!" Isn't this the true predecessor of kapok and 劫貝? Moreover, this word is Karpasa in Sanskrit, and it became Karpas in Persian and Hebrew. The sound of the Greek word is the same as the above, but the Latin word is Carbusa! As for the current English word for cotton, Cotton, and the French word, Coton, come from the Arabic language.

If this is the case, how did the name kapok gradually become "tree cotton" or "cotton"? I think the traces

Tales from the New Spring and Autumn Hell: Stories from the Palace of Yama by Su Cao

In the Palace of Yama, ox-headed and horse-faced demons stand on either side. In the center sits the majestic Yama, King of Hell. He is questioning a young ghost:

"Eh! Why have you returned again? You've been reborn three times, how have you returned so quickly?"

"Reporting to the Great King: My first rebirth was in a dilapidated house. My father was a peddler; my mother was hired as a wet nurse as soon as I was born, and I was left alone at home, never getting enough to eat. Before a month was up, I fell ill. I don't know if my mother was heartless, or if her employers wouldn't let her return, but she never came to take care of me. So, I came back. For my second rebirth, my father was a rickshaw puller, and he had three other children besides me. After I was born, I often saw them sighing and crying. After a few days, on a quiet, dark night, my father carried me, quietly went out, and placed me in a dark alley, leaving me to the wind and rain. I cried my lungs out, but no one paid me any attention. So, in less than two days, I had to come back again.

"So, what about the third time?" Yama seemed eager to know about his third experience.

"The third time?" The ghost cried. "Sadly, I hadn't even entered the human world, hadn't even seen my parents, before I was sent back."

"Then you should make a fourth attempt."

"No! Great King! I don't want to go again. Please don't make me suffer anymore!" The ghost pleaded bitterly. "They say the human world is a colorful and joyous place, but in my opinion, it's even more terrifying than our hell. I would rather be permanently lost in hell than go to the human world again."

"This is not a solution!" Yama frowned, turning to the judge and asking, "Do you have any suggestions? Otherwise, the underworld will inevitably suffer from a 'ghost' overcrowding problem." The judge shook his head, remaining silent. The Palace of Yama was silent, the scene even more gloomy and desolate. After a long time, the ox-headed and horse-faced demons seemed unable to bear it any longer. Without waiting for Yama's permission, they offered their opinions: "If Your Majesty were to order the capture of the parasites, treacherous merchants... from the human world, we could exchange them for a large number of unjustly dead souls. I wonder what Your Majesty thinks?"

Yama did not criticize this suggestion, nor did he seem to have heard it. He simply closed his eyes, as if pondering a solution to this difficult problem.

### Running on Ice in the Sunlight by Xu Ping (A Fictitious Story)

This is a fictitious story.

There was a merchant who made a lot of ill-gotten wealth from hoarding, manipulating, and monopolizing goods. He recently used the exploited ten thousand yuan to build a house.

Early the next morning, a nameless notice was posted on the gate of this newly built house, which read: "If not from exploiting everyone, where would this ten thousand yuan come from?"

The man who made this ill-gotten wealth was ashamed and angry after reading it. So, he placed a large advertisement in various newspapers, offering a reward of ten thousand yuan for the capture of the person who posted the notice at the gate of his new house.

A day later, another notice was posted on the gate of the new house: "Already scraped together ten thousand yuan, so where does this other ten thousand yuan come from?"

### Begonia by Qin Shouou

(9) A Strange Farmer

His uncle and cousins ​​had never seen the world, and although there were a few neighbors who were familiar with writing, he dared not interact with them casually. Apart from teasing Little Mei Bao and telling jokes, he could only sit in boredom all day long.

Later, he felt that he really couldn't sit still anymore. In the spring of the second year, he took off his long gown and went down to the fields barefooted, wearing straw sandals, to work with his cousin and several farmhands. However, his body was originally thin and small, and his skin was particularly fair and tender. In addition, he wore such a large piece of gauze on his face, not only never taking it off all year round, but also changing it for a new one every day. To people's eyes, it was first and foremost an eyesore. Therefore, the people of the Li family village almost all gossiped about his strange appearance behind his back.

However, as the days passed, people finally got used to it and no longer found it strange.

By the fourth year, the training of work and the scorching sun had completely transformed Begonia into a farmer on the outside. "Begonia," "Wu Yuqin," "Wu Jun"!... These names no longer appeared before his eyes or were heard in his ears. Everyone who saw him called him Lao San or Wu San. The him before the age of twenty-six seemed to have died at the same time as Luo Xiangqi.

Including his uncle and Mei Bao's nanny, no one would have thought that the famous actor who caused a sensation in the capital a few years ago on the red carpet was now this thin, dark, haggard farmer who looked as if he was already middle-aged.

For three years, Li family village was still Li family village, and everything and everyone remained the same, only Begonia had completely changed.

"Yi Di, you still shouldn't carry such heavy things!" One day, Begonia and Wang Si, the husband of the nanny, carried a large basket of soybeans back from the field. They were so tired that they couldn't catch their breath when they walked into their own door. His cousin, Wu Da, was pounding noodles in the yard, and he rushed over to take over for him as soon as he saw them. (127)

### Please Parents and Teachers, Pay Attention to Children's Health by Xi Di

This is a serious and urgent request concerning the health of thousands of children in the city. Here, let me first introduce a fact to everyone:

On Monday morning, the parent of a student ran to our school, telling us: "One of my twelve-year-old children always complained of an itchy head when returning home from school every day. Later, after examination, we found that his hair was full of white dots. These are head lice, please pay attention to it." After receiving this report, we thoroughly checked the students' hair in each grade. The result was truly unexpected. Out of all 358 students in the school, 125 had head lice, most of them being girls. At the time, many colleagues advocated for suspending classes, but the principal insisted on opposing it. His meaning was: in this difficult era, educators are working hard and fear they are not doing enough, how can we abandon the children's studies because of a small "head lice problem"? The principal's opinion was quite correct, and the colleagues dismissed their prejudices about "suspending" classes. The general solution to this problem is to isolate those with head lice to avoid widespread infection, and to ask parents to advise boys to shave their heads completely, and girls, if they keep their hair, should keep it within reasonable limits, and usually wash their hair more often and pay attention to cleanliness.

This unfortunate phenomenon is not only in our school, but other schools will also have it. I always feel that it is difficult to run elementary schools today, and it is even more difficult to run alleyway elementary schools. A three-story building has to squeeze in more than 300 students, and a classroom in a wing is full of heads, accommodating 40, 50, or 60 students. Moreover, the toilet is connected to the kindergarten class, and the kitchen is connected to the sixth grade. Alas! Education? Hygiene? How easy is it to talk about?

However, we should not only blame the school, the school has its own difficulties! Regarding children's health issues, parents should also bear a great responsibility.

We often see many families where parents play mahjong at the table, neglecting their children in the alleyway, letting them fight or run around. Alas! Education? Hygiene? How easy is it to talk about?

Children are the future masters of the country. As parents and teachers, how can we bear to hinder their health and harm their physical and mental well-being?

### Western Hemisphere French Colonies Establish Agreement with U.S., Guaranteeing No Harm to American Interests, Allowing U.S. Planes and Warships to Patrol Islands

Washington: Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the United States has entered into an agreement with High Commissioner Robert, admiral in the French territories in the Western Hemisphere, guaranteeing that no activities harmful to American interests will occur within the French territories under his administration. Secretary of State Hull wrote to New York Democratic Senator Byrd, informing him that this agreement had been reached, as Byrd had previously inquired about this matter. Hull stated that the agreement stipulates that France provide "certain guarantees regarding the actions of French ships in American waters, and allow prior notification before shipping gold." The agreement also permits daily patrols by aircraft and ships on the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. The United States has dispatched one naval observer to Martinique to monitor French compliance with the agreement. The United States has agreed to expand relief efforts to the French islands and French Guiana in exchange. The U.S. government also allows a small portion of French funds frozen in the United States to be released daily so that the French islands can use them to purchase food and necessities, with the stipulation that these items may not be transported to French North Africa or mainland France. Hull also said that the United States has carefully considered various situations regarding French territories in the Western Hemisphere, "If evidence later arises that the United States must take defensive action, you can be sure that any action the United States intends to take will be in accordance with the resolutions of the Havana Pan-American Conference." (United Press Telegram, 8th)

### U.S. State Department Drafts Response to French Note

Washington: The State Department is currently drafting a reply to the French note received a few days ago regarding the relationship between Vichy and Washington. The nature of this response can be easily inferred from Secretary of State Hull's remarks on France this week. It is generally observed that the remarks made by French Ambassador to the United States Henry-Haye on Friday may not soften the tone of this reply. There is mounting evidence that the U.S. authorities are becoming increasingly intolerant of France or its current leaders. Vichy has not been in contact with the U.S. ambassador to France, Leahy, with the candor it should have, and after Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan made bellicose remarks, the French authorities here issued a statement that Darlan's and Vichy's attitudes were completely misunderstood by the United States. All of this is particularly likely to arouse American indignation. Henry-Haye was eager to meet with Hull on Friday, but Hull refused due to a lack of time, and had to postpone the meeting until Monday, which is also very meaningful. It is rare for Hull to treat an ambassador of a country in this way. Observing the attitude of the officialdom here, it can now be asserted that after this American reply is sent out, Vichy will understand the U.S. position or the U.S. government's view of Vichy's recent actions, and there will be no misunderstanding, because this document will explain that France cannot hope to please both sides. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)

Rome: Political circles and newspapers here are paying close attention to the situation in Syria and the tense relationship between France and the United States that has resulted from it. Among them, the Tribune reports that the relationship between France and the United States is indeed extremely tense. If the two sides break off diplomatic relations as a result, the United States is bound to recognize the de Gaulle faction as the sole representative of France, but it is said that General Wavell, commander of the British Near East forces, opposes using force against Syria for strategic reasons. (Havas Telegram, 7th)

Washington: French Ambassador to the United States Henry-Haye made a statement to the press this morning: "I believe German troops have landed in Syria." Newspapers here mostly use large headlines to publish this statement simultaneously with the communiqué issued by the French government, and add comments, generally stating that although France has always held a compromising attitude toward Britain, it is still determined to defend its territorial sovereignty. For example, the Washington Star, which has always advocated aid to Britain, wrote, "Previously, people generally expected Britain to strike Syria, but this has not materialized. At the same time, the tone of those in London who advocate military intervention has also tended to soften. This phenomenon of easing is unusual and unexpected, especially when Britain is accusing France of colluding with the Axis powers and Secretary of State Hull is also condemning the Vichy government's pro-German policies. The reason for this may be that Britain has to be cautious in diplomatic or military terms regarding Syria, which has led to this situation. From a military point of view, the British forces in Africa are unwilling to clash with the French forces stationed in Syria, fearing that the move to defeat the French garrison in Syria will cause French people elsewhere to defect to Germany."

### British Ambassador Meets with Welles to Discuss Tense Situation

Washington: British Ambassador to the United States Halifax met with U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles for thirty minutes yesterday to discuss the tense situation caused by Franco-German cooperation. The British Ambassador declined to comment on the talks. (United Press Telegram, 8th)

Washington: U.S. officials are closely watching developments in Vichy. Among all French regions, Vietnam, Dakar, and Martinique are those whose utilization by the Germans would pose a threat to Britain and other American allies. Vietnam is on the side of the Pacific Ocean, and the Axis ally Japan has already invaded it. Dakar is on the side of the sea route to the New World, and Martinique is near the Panama Canal, the central area of Western Hemisphere defense. Fortunately, from the perspective of Britain and the United States, all the hundreds of French islands in the Pacific Ocean, from Clipperton near Mexico to New Caledonia near Australia, are either pro-Allied or under the de Gaulle Free French regime. These islands, such as the Society Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Leeward Islands, and Tahiti, if ideally controlled by Vichy and allowed to be used by the Germans, could be used by the Germans as bases for refueling and supplying raiders. At present, except for Vietnam, there seems to be nothing in the Pacific Ocean that would cause the United States to worry. Vietnam has already given extensive concessions to the Japanese military, and logically, if the area is used as a base by Germany and Japan, it could become a tool for attacking Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, or Rangoon. Although the possibility of this danger forces senior U.S. administrative authorities to pay attention to the Pacific situation, U.S. authorities are currently paying attention to the Atlantic situation because the French West African base in Dakar there can be used by the Germans as a base for aircraft, submarines, and raiders to attack British and American shipping, and it is an excellent base. The U.S. President, in his recent fireside chat, revealed that he feared that the Germans might use the area. As for other French territories in North Africa, they are very important in the outcome of the war. Many people speculate that the Germans may be able to use Algeria and French Morocco to help attack Gibraltar and drive the British out of the Mediterranean. Currently, the French forces on Martinique are close to the United States. These forces include the aircraft carrier Béarn, a heavy cruiser, and hundreds of combat aircraft. The United States has been very concerned about the actions of these French forces. Although the French forces have firmly guaranteed that they will not take offensive action and have ordered all aircraft not to fly to the Panama Canal, the Americans are very afraid that these people may one day be instructed by the Germans to attack the Panama Canal. The situation on Martinique is temporarily stable as a result of French guarantees and U.S. naval patrols in the vicinity. However, this is still a possible factor that could disrupt U.S.-French relations. (United Press Telegram, 8th)

### U.S. Aid to Britain Crossing Atlantic; Winant Says Britain Determined to Fight; Germany States No Intention to Attack U.S.

Washington: After leaving the State Department yesterday, U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant was unwilling to confirm or deny yesterday's reports that he made remarks to senators. However, when reporters asked if there was a tendency toward peace in various parts of Britain, Winant replied, "The British government and the people are unwavering. This is a people's war, and they all know it." He also said that he was pleased to report that American aid was increasing steadily and was now crossing the Atlantic Ocean. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)

Berlin: After President Roosevelt made a speech about German propaganda in the United States, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman told foreign reporters yesterday: "Germany has instructed German expatriates in the United States to state that Germany has no intention of attacking the Western Hemisphere. This is an open fact, not some secret document, and there is no need to avoid it. As for what Roosevelt said about German expatriates spreading rumors when U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant returned to the country, claiming that Britain would compromise with Germany if the United States did not aid Britain, the words of some American celebrities prove that Roosevelt's words contradict each other. For example, Willkie openly stated that if Britain cannot stop or significantly reduce the loss of ships, it will be impossible to continue the war. Didn't Hull and Lothian state in their pro-British speeches that if the United States did not increase aid to Britain, Britain would not be able to overcome its current difficulties? Roosevelt himself has made this argument. How can it be called German propaganda?" (Hai Tong News Agency Telegram, 8th)

### Gibraltar's Defenses Fortified

Gibraltar: Gibraltar is prepared for a German attack from the Spanish border. According to neutral military experts, German troops would have to sacrifice 50,000 men if they attacked. Military authorities believe that Gibraltar has been preparing for many years and has recently completed a secret defense design, so its fortifications are as solid as any maritime fortress. Therefore, they are not alarmed by reports that the Germans intend to attack Gibraltar. Gibraltar is ready for war. If Britain wants to control the passage to North Africa and the Near East, it must defend Gibraltar. Plans to resist any attack or siege have now been completed. In the narrow strip of land between the Spanish mainland and Gibraltar, huge, densely packed obstacles have been completed, many of which are highly secret. All the houses between the border and the Rock have been demolished, and the gunners of the defenders have an unobstructed line of sight. The attacking troops will be subjected to merciless fire from hidden stone positions. The land route to La Línea de la Concepción in Spain is full of landmines, and the attacking German troops must overcome the fortifications built by German engineers during the Spanish Civil War, and the attackers will be subject to artillery fire when they pass through the western defense line. Spanish newspapers say that the main defense against land attacks on Gibraltar is the canal system recently completed, which separates British territory from the mainland. Gibraltar has no air base on the port, so it is vulnerable to air raids, but residents can escape into the Rock and not be hit by bombs. Gibraltar has become an underground city, with hospitals, shops, food stores, and armories all protected by hundreds of feet of solid rock. Many people believe that the large amounts of military supplies and food stored underground are sufficient to cope with any siege. The positions facing the sea and other equipment to prevent sea attacks have the same strength as those facing the sea on the north side and the land side. Anti-aircraft guns have also been installed. (United Press Telegram, 8th)
