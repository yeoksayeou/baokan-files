### British Foreign Secretary Eden Provides Assurance: Aiding China in Maintaining Independence; Japan Rejects British Economic Interests in China; Britain Resolves on a Fixed Policy to Cope

London - During yesterday's House of Commons session, a Member of Parliament requested Foreign Secretary Eden to comment on Sino-British relations. Eden stated, "I can gladly report that the relationship between the Chinese and British governments remains harmonious, cooperative, and exceptionally close. As we are engaged in a struggle for survival against aggression in Europe and the Middle East, the British people naturally sympathize with China's efforts to resist foreign domination and maintain its independence." (Applause from the floor.) The British government has done its utmost to help China maintain its independence in the past and will continue to do so in the future. (Applause from the floor.) (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

London - British Foreign Secretary Eden responded to a Member of Parliament's questions about Japan in the House of Commons yesterday, and his response was met with sustained applause. The Member pointed out that Eden's tone indicated Britain's determination to adopt a much-needed policy toward Japan. Numerous Members questioned Japan's failure to fulfill its promises and its continued exclusion of other countries' trade in occupied areas of China. Eden replied that the Japanese side has repeatedly violated its guarantees and rejected British interests in China, and the Japanese government cannot escape responsibility. He has said this before. Britain has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese government, but the results have been unsatisfactory. He has now instructed the British Ambassador to Japan to respond to Japan's criticisms of economic restrictions within British territory, stating that the primary purpose of British restrictions is to maintain supplies for its own use and prevent them from falling into enemy hands. However, Britain's economic policy will naturally be influenced by the Japanese government's attitude toward British interests in China. Conservative MP Milner raised the point that the House of Commons would undoubtedly be pleased with the Foreign Secretary's statement and requested the Foreign Secretary to provide assurance that this policy would be pursued with determination. Eden replied that the policy would be pursued with determination. The Japanese government criticizes Britain's economic policy, but if Japan does not treat British interests in China with appropriate consideration, it cannot expect to gain any benefits in this regard.

Chongqing - All the newspapers here have prominently featured, in large characters, British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons, stating that Britain will continue to aid China's struggle for independence with all its strength. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

London - Conservative MP Hannah recently asked in the House of Commons what actions Foreign Secretary Eden has taken regarding the actions of the chairman of the anti-British association in Beijing, who threatened to punish anyone openly selling British goods.

It is anticipated that the United States will undertake urgent diplomatic action regarding the Far East and Europe.

### Hull Receives Soviet Ambassador

Washington - Secretary of State Hull and Soviet Ambassador Oumansky, who have not met for discussions for over a year, are scheduled to meet today. Therefore, it is widely believed that the currently uncertain US-Soviet relations will soon become clearer. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

Washington - Secretary of State Hull is scheduled to meet with Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky within the next few days for discussions. It is anticipated that various outstanding issues between the United States and the Soviet Union will be resolved. After the United States government restricted the shipment of certain goods to the Soviet Union, the quantity of goods purchased by the Soviet Union from the United States decreased sharply, almost to zero. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Washington - Reliable Congressional sources stated yesterday that the United States' dispatch of a squadron of Flying Fortresses to Hawaii, and other recent developments, are generally believed to be based on the United States' preparation for urgent diplomatic actions in the Far East and Europe. It was further stated that a state of full readiness is evident here. All major administrative leaders remain silent amidst the most critical circumstances of the war. Sources familiar with the matter also believe that President Roosevelt's cancellation of his scheduled speech at the Pan-American Congress and his press conference at the White House, as well as the cancellation of press conferences by other cabinet members in the past few days, are evidence of the United States' preparation for drastic action. Congressional sources stated that the last declaration by an administrative leader was Secretary of the Navy Knox's speech, in which Knox declared that the United States was on standby. The dispatch of airplanes to Hawaii and the refusal to release information about the movement of warships and airplanes are all of great significance. One expert believes that the administration may be trying to prevent Japan from taking certain actions. To cope with this, the United States must keep its forces focused on the Far East. The expert also cited the administration's recommendation to close loopholes in the Philippines to prevent raw materials from being shipped to unfriendly countries, as well as other strong stances toward the Far East in the past fourteen days. Congressional sources stated that the main stage for diplomatic action seems to be in Europe, and the administration is considering certain actions regarding the issue of supplying American goods to Britain. However, the most reliable sources do not believe that the United States will announce that it will use warships to escort and protect the shipment of military supplies to Britain.

Italian Newspaper Claims that if the US Joins the European War, Japan will Immediately Wage War Against the Democratic Nations

Rome - Italian Premier Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, declared in the Italian Daily Newspaper today that if the United States participates in the current European war, Japan will naturally declare war on the Western democracies. Gayda forcefully argued that Japan's interests lie with the Axis powers in resisting the Anglo-Saxon group and stated that those in North America who incite war pay attention to Europe but neglect Asia, and therefore deliberately ignore the fact that if the United States fights the Axis powers, the war will inevitably expand. Gayda's article stated that the United States, in whatever way it participates in the war, will turn the war into a war between Europe and the Americas. From "the near future," additional [forces] will continue to be dispatched to Hawaii. He also stated that the Army has been continuously strengthening the defenses of Hawaii with new-style fighter jets and twin-engine bombers over the past few months. (United Press dispatch, 15th)

Honolulu - The United States Army in Hawaii yesterday officially confirmed Washington's announcement that a "Flying Fortress" bomber group of twenty-one planes had flown to Hawaii.

At the same time, authorities announced that they hope that in the near future the Hawaiian Air Force will receive more material reinforcements. Officials also confirmed Washington's announcement that the Hawaiian military had recently increased its strength by a large number of new-style pursuit planes and light bomber aircraft, thus greatly enhancing their material strength. (United Press dispatch, 15th)

London - US Ambassador to Britain Winant recently gave a speech at the English Association, in which he said, "The fate of a free people depends on how well they use their naval power. We are in the midst of the greatest war in history. For the sake of protecting freedom in the modern world, democratic nations have shown the world that if they want to retain the right to speak, they must have the power to act." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Thai Newspaper Dissatisfied with Japan's Malicious Propaganda

Bangkok - A Thai daily newspaper editorial expressed extreme dissatisfaction with Tokyo's wireless propaganda methods, stating that if Tokyo continues to spread propaganda unfavorable to Thailand, it will inevitably cause disputes between Japan and Thailand, eventually leading to a crisis in Asia. The newspaper recounted Tokyo wireless's unintentional inflammatory propaganda and expressed dissatisfaction with the broadcast that overseas Chinese are now leaving Thailand and returning to Nanjing, which is controlled by Japan. The newspaper concluded that Japan has leaped to become the strongest country in Asia, and Thailand respects it because of its leadership position, but this should not be interpreted as other countries being subservient to Tokyo. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### Twenty-One US Flying Fortresses Complete Collective Flight; the Route is Between San Francisco and Hawaii; the Purpose is to Consolidate the Defense of the Island

Washington - The War Department stated yesterday that twenty-one "Flying Fortress" bombers had completed a collective flight from San Francisco to Hawaii to consolidate the defense of the island. A War Department announcement stated that the bombers, led by Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Emmons, took off at 9:25 PM (Eastern Standard Time) on Tuesday and safely landed at Hickam Field on Oahu Island at 11:28 AM (Eastern Standard Time) yesterday. These planes are the latest model of 21-ton Boeing long-range bombers, designated as BA-17, and are heavily equipped with armament and armor plating. The War Department also stated that many medium-range bombers and Flying Fortresses capable of continuing to fly 1,800 miles over water had caused the addition of other continents. Gayda said that Japan is now paying attention to the evolution of the European war and the relationship between the United States and the war, as much as it pays attention to China and Asia. Japan knows that the hostility of Anglo-Saxon imperialists towards Japan is far greater than their hostility towards the Axis powers. Japan also knows that if the Anglo-Saxons defeat the Axis powers in Europe, they will destroy what Japan has gained in China and eliminate Japan from Asia. (United Press dispatch, 15th)

Singapore - Military authorities have announced that the defenses of Malaya were further strengthened yesterday by the arrival of a large number of British troops. The British troops, including army, air force, and naval personnel, arrived yesterday afternoon and were in high spirits and good health despite the long journey. The communique added that the army personnel included infantry, artillery, and service corps. This deployment is part of Britain's policy of strengthening Malaya's defenses. The landing of the new troops was facilitated by several US transport ships, which are currently unloading military supplies shipped from the US under the Lend-Lease Act. Another group watching the landing of the British troops was the Chinese military delegation led by General Shang Zhen, who arrived on May 10th to observe the overall defenses. The delegation said that Malaya's defensive strength was excellent, and that the troops from various parts of the British Empire were cooperating very well. During their visit to Kuala Lumpur, the leaders of the delegation also had discussions with Major General Bennett, commander of the Australian forces in Malaya. (United Press dispatch, 15th)

Editorial

### What Britain Can Do Now

"What should Britain do for China now?" This question has indeed been circulating among many upright British people recently. They hope to obtain a reassuring and satisfactory answer. Britain has long had enlightened individuals, and now, at least with regard to China and the Far East, the enlightened are in the majority. In the past, the roots of the disaster in the Far East, the value and impact of China's resistance, and Britain's responsibilities and relationships in this matter were not well understood by the majority of the British people. They thought that Britain had its own way, its own way of not suffering losses. This illusion, speaking from today, is completely gone. Now, most British people, who are indeed upright, can understand things more thoroughly. They recognize that Britain winning in Europe while China loses in Asia, or Britain losing in Europe while China wins in Asia, is absolutely unacceptable and impossible. Only if both China and Britain win, only if China and Britain win completely, can the international situation be stabilized and the world's problems be solved. Otherwise, one defeat means two defeats, and China, Britain, and even the world and the international community will be completely defeated and finished. Of course, only the enlightened can recognize this, and only the upright are willing to admit it. After recognizing and admitting this, they must recall the past. Thus, the enlightened and upright, while not ignoring the difficulties of the present, all have a sense of "regret for not acting sooner," believing that if aggression had been stopped in the beginning, would the problem be as difficult as it is today? The past is past, complaining is useless, and regret is too late, so they ask about the present.

Now, China is resolutely upholding its spirit of the past four years, continuing to fight, having suffered many losses and made enormous sacrifices. Although the day of final victory is getting closer, the difficulties and hardships are deepening. All kinds of construction are sprouting and thriving, but they are behind schedule. Military equipment is crude and simple, and only hoping for gradual self-sufficiency is insufficient. Therefore, they look forward to foreign aid like rain during a severe drought. If a certain country is only sympathetic to China, then how to help is a matter of doing their best and acting according to their capabilities. Britain, from any angle, any aspect, any meaning, and any position, has the necessity of doing everything possible to provide effective aid to China with all its strength. Unfortunately, the greatest possible opportunity for Britain to aid China has passed. Britain calls itself the hegemon of the seas, but from the North Sea to the Atlantic to the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, it is being provoked and spied upon by powerful enemies everywhere. Although the situation is not critical, it is serious. Although the future is not bleak, it is distant. They must devote all their efforts and concentrate all their attention. Therefore, the reasons for aiding China remain, the necessity remains, but the possibilities for aiding China have drastically decreased and are decreasing further due to the limitations of the situation. How can upright people not hesitate about what to do!

On land, there are tanks that can crush strong defenses, and cannons that can defeat the enemy. In the air, there are defensive fighter planes and offensive bombers. On the sea, there are anti-blockade and counter-attack capabilities, with giant warships of all classes and various small boats. These are all things that Britain has and China needs. Expeditionary forces land in Norway and Greece. Naval and air forces attack Germany and Italy. These are all things that China admires and Britain excels at. If Britain, based on the reasons for aiding China and recognizing the necessity of aiding China, started from its Eastern territories and advanced further east, this would surely change the overall situation in the Far East. At that time, if the Chinese army were to conduct its work of sweeping and clearing within Chinese territory, the military effectiveness achieved would surely be remarkable and outstanding. Unfortunately, such an imagined scene has never existed in the past, and it is not necessarily so in the future, and it is impossible in the present. What is called a small possibility, although not absolute, should never be forced. Whatever is inappropriate or impossible is what China does not seek and what Britain does not do.

What China can seek and what Britain can do is the answer to "what to do?" Yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Eden replied to questions from Members of Parliament in the House of Commons. According to London dispatches, those who heard it at the time responded with cheers. After receiving this dispatch, we would also like to respond with approval. Eden stated that Britain sympathizes with China's resistance to foreign domination and its efforts to maintain independence. He also stated that Britain has done its utmost to help China maintain independence in the past and will do so in the future. Furthermore, he said that Britain will resolutely pursue its policy of economic restrictions within its territory. This is what Britain can do. As for what China seeks, at present and in relation to Britain, it is by no means asking Britain to send any small portion of its land, sea, or air forces to participate in the Far Eastern war and help China fight. China only asks Britain to do as much as possible, as quickly as possible, and as strictly as possible what it can do, that is, to clearly distinguish the object, meaning, and scope of the so-called "enemy." In the economic aspect, not only should they "maintain supplies for its own use and prevent them from falling into enemy hands," but also, regarding military, commercial, and even agricultural and industrial goods, regardless of whether Britain has a surplus or not, regardless of whether Britain lacks them or not, absolutely not supply or accept even the slightest amount.

### Intense Fighting in Southern Shanxi; Chinese Troops Firmly Defend Zhongtiao Mountain; Japanese Troops Retreat from the North Bank of the Yellow River; Chinese Troops in Guangdong Recapture Huaxian City

Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman announced this afternoon while raising expectations for newspaper reporters that the eastern section of Zhongtiao Mountain in Southern Shanxi currently has . . . The outcome of this battle may determine whether the Japanese army will be able to completely control the north bank of the Yellow River. The Japanese army has concentrated six divisions and two mixed brigades to attack Southern Shanxi. However, so far only three divisions have actually participated in the battle. The Japanese army began its offensive on May 8th, with elite troops advancing from north to south, directly to Yuanqu on the north bank of the Yellow River, causing the Chinese troops defending Zhongtiao Mountain to be dispersed. The spokesman acknowledged that the Chinese troops defending the western section of Zhongtiao Mountain had been subjected to pressure from the Japanese army. However, the Chinese troops still hold the positions in the eastern section. According to the latest intelligence received by the Chinese military headquarters, the Japanese troops who had reached the north bank of the Yellow River have suddenly retreated north. The motive for this move cannot be determined. The Japanese army may have turned north and encircled the Chinese troops in the eastern section of Zhongtiao Mountain. Someone asked whether the Japanese army would cross the Yellow River and advance towards Luoyang or Xi'an. The spokesman replied that this development would depend on two things: (1) whether the Japanese army can eliminate the Chinese troops on Zhongtiao Mountain, and (2) whether the Japanese army can add three to five new divisions to participate in the offensive. The spokesman also said that no troops from the Eighteenth Group Army (Communist Army) are participating in the battle of Zhongtiao Mountain. It is said that some Japanese troops are carrying motorized boats, but to date there are no signs that the Japanese army intends to cross the Yellow River. Currently, in addition to a portion of the Japanese army holding Zhongtiao Mountain, there are also some troops stationed in Fengmengu (transliteration) on the north bank of the Yellow River, and there are strong forces attacking Yangbei, north of Zhongtiao Mountain. The spokesman also stated that the Japanese army in northern Hubei is currently attacking Suizhou, Zhongxiang, and Jingmen in several directions, with the aim of supporting the Japanese offensive in Southern Shanxi and eliminating the Chinese troops in the Dabie Mountains. The spokesman pointed out that the purpose of these Japanese troops in several directions is to prevent the Chinese troops in Henan province from crossing the river to aid the battle in Southern Shanxi. The Japanese army in northern Hubei is currently threatening Nanyang, an important town less than two of Luoyang. Although the current situation is still unclear, it can be said that the purpose of this offensive by the Japanese army is to end the war against China as soon as possible. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### German Planes Land in Syria with Disguised Markings British Order Action and Inform US German Torpedo Boats also sail into Mediterranean via Marseille

Cairo: Several German planes using disguised markings landed at three airfields in Syria. Their purpose is apparently to head to Iraq. According to travelers arriving here from Syria, a senior German official is currently in Beirut discussing matters with the Italian Armistice Commission and French authorities. (Reuters, 15th)

London: Reliable sources announced this afternoon that the French authorities in Syria have now allowed Germans to use airfields there for flights to Iraq. Therefore, the British government has been granted full authority to deal with German planes at Syrian airfields. (Reuters, 15th)

### German Ships Gather on Lower Danube Threatening Soviet Union to Demand Concessions

Ankara: German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, presented a friendly letter from Hitler to the Turkish President yesterday. (Reuters, 15th)

London: The German News Agency reported that German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, met with the Turkish President for one hour on Wednesday afternoon. Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu was also present. According to a Turkish official gazette, Franz von Papen paid a routine visit to the Turkish Foreign Minister after returning to his post yesterday. The Turkish Cabinet held its weekly meeting that day, and the Turkish Foreign Minister reported on foreign affairs at a non-public meeting of the People's Party, lasting one hour. The Turkish Prime Minister also reported on foreign developments. The meeting then adjourned amidst cheers. (Reuters, 15th)

Ankara: The main topic of discussion here is where Germany will act next. Most believe it will be in Syria. One newspaper commented, "Germany wants to invade Egypt via Syria. However, how the German army will enter Syria is Germany's business. In any case, Germany will not pass through Turkey; this is what we know for sure." Another newspaper carried an unconfirmed report that German bombers had arrived in Mosul, Iraq. According to many people, Hitler is currently trying to persuade Darlan to urge Pétain to allow German troop transport planes to land in Syria and then enter Iraq. It is said that 15 German divisions are currently stationed in Moldavia, more than the number stationed there before the start of the invasion of the Balkans. It is also known that Germany has concentrated a large number of flat-bottomed naval vessels on the lower Danube, indicating that Hitler intends to attack the Soviet Union or use it as a threat of invasion to demand concessions from Stalin. The Turkish government is calmly monitoring the situation and continuing to take defensive measures. Parliament has approved an additional national defense expenditure of £13 million in Turkish currency. (Reuters, 15th)

Rome: Axis authorities here predicted yesterday that within two or three weeks, the Axis powers will take major actions to consolidate Europe, control the Near East, and deploy Axis forces in the South Atlantic to establish fortresses to prevent US interference. It is claimed that important diplomatic negotiations are underway to easily achieve the above three objectives. Because food and oil are essential for final victory, the Axis powers are now striving to obtain these two items from the Soviet Union, which is believed to be agreeable. However, if the Soviet Union obstructs them, the Axis powers are prepared to use "the most drastic actions" against the Soviet Union to achieve their goals. The Axis powers are now completing their plan to attack the Suez Canal. Turkish, French, and German representatives are negotiating in Ankara to bring Turkey into closer cooperation with the "New Order." Another step is to attack Gibraltar. Even if this ancient British stronghold does not fall, its effect will be neutralized by the strengthening of the Axis base in the western Mediterranean. This step involves closer cooperation between the Axis powers and Spain. Franco-Spanish cooperation has already reached an understanding. Italy will gain control of the Adriatic and Aegean Seas and will modify its demands on French North Africa. The final stage of Axis action is to deploy forces in Dhaka and Casablanca in southwestern Spain to intercept US aid to Britain. (International News Service, 15th)

### British Foreign Secretary Elaborates on Situation in Iraq Air Force Controls Habbaniyah Port of Basra All Quiet

London: Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday elaborated on the recent situation in Iraq in the House of Commons, stating that the British Air Force detachment in Habbaniyah had repelled the Iraqi army's attack and now controlled the entire area around the town. The British Air Force detachment and British forces in Basra are rapidly reinforcing. The British Air Force is constantly attacking military targets throughout Iraq. The British government believes that the actions of Ali Gaylani and his associates in attacking loyal allies are not supported by the entire Iraqi population. The British government has no intention of threatening Iraqi independence. Its only wish is to guarantee its legitimate treaty rights. (Reuters, 15th)

Mumbai: The last batch of several hundred British women and children evacuated from Habbaniya, Iraq, has arrived safely here. According to reports, they were fired upon by Ali Gaylani's forces while being evacuated by plane from Habbaniyah to Basra amidst exploding bombs, shells, and the chatter of machine guns. A senior official of the British Colonial Office, who has been stationed in Iraq for many years, has arrived in India with his wife, stating that all is quiet in Basra and the provincial government is functioning as usual.

### Amery Gives Speech Striving to Cope with Naval and Air Battles Seeking to Preserve Iraq's Independence

London: Secretary of State for India Leo Amery, speaking in Coventry last night, first stated that the initial air battle over Britain last autumn had shattered Hitler's dream of swallowing up an unarmed British Empire. He then said that the second air battle over Britain and the submarine war in the Atlantic are currently underway. We must devote all our energy and skill to cope with it and persevere to the end, no matter how long it continues. Hitler is no closer to his goal of ambition against Britain than he was when he abandoned the first air battle over Britain six months ago. He went on to describe the situation in the Balkans, saying that the German campaign in the Balkans, which was unexpected and costly, may have disrupted Hitler's overall plan for a triumphant advance across Turkey. In the coming months, Germany will fully feel its impact on transportation and supply lines. He also mentioned the situation in Iraq, saying that a rather dangerous situation has developed in Iraq. We have forced Ali Gaylani and his followers to reveal their actions in the faint hope that the German side will provide timely assistance. The boil that was about to fester has been lanced. The actions we have taken do not have the intention of eliminating Iraqi independence, as our country and I, when I held office, did everything in our power to preserve Iraq's independence. All we seek is to fulfill our alliance obligations, which Iraq has voluntarily accepted as the only effective guarantee of its security. (Reuters, 15th)

### Scorching Heat in North Africa Saw Battle in Western Desert German Troops Halted Before Reaching Egypt South African Air Force Deployed in Desert

Cairo: The fighting in the Western Desert remains a battle of attrition. After the German attack on Sunday, the British forces took the initiative, sending motorized patrols to attack in the Sollum area and harass enemy columns around Tobruk. Military sources believe that the German attack is intended to temporarily prevent the activities of British armored patrols. The scorching heat in North Africa is increasing, making it difficult to conduct large-scale military operations. However, military sources are confident that whatever strategy the enemy adopts, they will be met with a heavy blow from the British forces. (Reuters, 15th)

London: A Reuters correspondent with a mobile patrol in the Western Desert reported that the German troops advancing into Egypt had been halted 40 miles long and 90 miles from the Egyptian border. Intelligence planes reported that one or two of the five German routes appeared to be retreating. Therefore, the German army may have abandoned its coastal advance and attempted to cross the desert south to cut off the Allied forces. It is not yet clear whether this German attack was a large-scale offensive or merely a fierce attack to probe the strength of the Allied forces and their positions. When the German attack began at dawn on Monday, it was stopped by the Allied forces' forward positions. As the German eight-wheeled armored vehicles and tanks advanced, raising clouds of dust, the Allied artillery batteries bombarded the areas where the dust rose, and the German advance came to a halt. When the German army tried to find a way to break through the Allied lines, British fighter planes suddenly swooped down and strafed them. The German army scattered in panic. The British planes continued to swoop down and attack the German army relentlessly throughout the day, only stopping when dusk fell in the desert and enemy vehicles could no longer be distinguished. The South African Air Force, transferred from Eritrea, fought in the Western Desert for the first time that day. (Reuters, 15th)

Berlin: It has just been learned from responsible sources here that the German Air Force went to the area south of Sollum on the 13th to assist the German army in its operations, bombing Allied concentrations and trucks. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)

Nairobi: According to a statement issued today, British forces continue to achieve victories on all fronts in Abyssinia. On Tuesday, British forces captured nine light tanks from the Italian army. (Reuters, 15th)

### Twelve Soviet Speculators Executed

Moscow: A Moscow Radio broadcast announced that twelve employees of the National Food Cooperative were sentenced to death yesterday for speculating in liquor and sugar, causing the Soviet Union to lose US$50 million. Twenty-five others were also sentenced to various terms of imprisonment for the same crime. (Associated Press, 15th)

### Diplomatic Advisor to British Economic Warfare Department Killed

London: England, a diplomatic advisor to the British Economic Warfare Department, was killed while inspecting a fire station during an air raid at the age of 50. He went to Peiping as a counselor in 1929, served as chargé d'affaires in China from 1931 to 1934, and was then transferred to Italy as chargé d'affaires. In 1939, he joined the Economic Warfare Department. (Reuters, 15th)

### European Nations Will Not Tolerate Rule The World's Future Hope Depends on British-American Understanding

London: British Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech here yesterday that Europe will never tolerate one ruling nation and others as subject nations. The Nazis are now fighting against history and natural forces and trying to reverse the trend of the world. Therefore, there are signs of division among the small group of parties who seek to extend their rule by force. The fact that Hess, who shook the world, landed in Britain with an umbrella can at least provide some explanation. The greatest hope for the future of the world lies in British-American understanding. We have the same traditions and habits. What does it mean when we say that we are willing to endure any hardship that German military forces can inflict, but we will never abandon our beliefs? I think the world can understand it. (Reuters, 15th)

### Fierce Naval and Air Battles in Western Mediterranean German and Italian Planes Attack British Convoy Battles for Eight Hours Without Success

London: A Reuters correspondent with the British Fleet in the Mediterranean reported from the HMS Ark Royal that while escorting a convoy in the Western Mediterranean last week, enemy planes attacked, leading to eight hours of fierce fighting with British fighters and British warships' guns. The enemy planes were unsuccessful and fled. Then, the Italian broadcaster shamelessly boasted that several British planes had been shot down and that three British warships had been severely damaged, which is laughable. In fact, Italian bombers, protected by a large number of fighters and assisted by German planes, attacked in favorable weather, but no bombs fell near the British warships, let alone hit them. Instead, they were heavily bombarded by British fighters and British ships' guns, losing seven and severely damaging five. On that day, enemy planes constantly threatened and launched four attacks in total, with torpedo bombers and high-flying bombers attacking twice each. British warships' fighters were on alert all day, flying into the low-lying clouds at any time to attack the enemy bomber formations. At that time, the British fleet was sailing between the Cagliari naval base and Sicily, so the Italian side was able to send many formations of well-equipped, fast-flying land-based fighters to protect the Italian bombers. The British ships' guns roared together continuously throughout the day, with flashes of gunfire and black smoke everywhere. The British fighters also tumbled in the clouds, attacking the enemy bombers. It was often seen that columns of water rose high on the horizon far around the British ships, as the enemy bombers, although protected, were heavily attacked by British fighters and fled in panic into the sea. The British fighters fought bravely against a large number of enemies, repeatedly dispersing enemy bombers hiding in the clouds, waiting for an opportunity to swoop down and drop bombs. At dusk, enemy torpedo bombers launched a final attack, while 30 German dive bombers, covered by six fighters, circled in the clouds, apparently planning to attack at the same time. Six British fighters happened to rush in, sweeping with machine guns, and immediately saw a German plane catch fire and fall into the sea. Two enemy fighters, staggering and smoking, fled into the clouds. The remaining enemy planes surrounded and attacked the small formation of British planes, but they bravely fought back. The enemy planes finally dropped their bombs into the sea and fled. Although the British planes were riddled with bullets, they still flew back in triumph. (Reuters, 15th)

### Laval Actively Collaborates with Germany: The US is About to Take Strong Measures. The German Foreign Minister Plans to Visit Paris to Announce the Franco-German Declaration. It is Rumored that Hitler Proposed Returning Paris to Vichy.

Washington - It was learned here yesterday that if Vichy actively cooperates with Germany, it will inevitably receive strong countermeasures from the United States. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull, at a reception for reporters, withheld criticism of the rumors that Vichy had approved the Hitler-Darlan agreement. However, another official said, "We still do not know its effect," meaning that the State Department does not yet know the details of the agreement. Officials here yesterday declined to comment on how this matter would affect the US food supply to France. However, newspapers said that German-French relations were a matter of great official concern. (United Press dispatch, 15th)

London - British Foreign Secretary Eden, speaking in the House of Commons yesterday, referred to the recent Franco-German agreement on lifting border restrictions and reducing occupation costs, saying that no official announcement had been made regarding what actions France would take to reciprocate Germany's so-called concessions. However, the Vichy government pointed to this agreement as a new progress towards Franco-German cooperation. Regardless of what concessions French Foreign Minister Darlan makes, he believes that although the French people are unable to prevent the Germans from systematically exploiting their resources, they may not be willing to sacrifice their noble traditions and customs and actively work for Germany of their own accord, thus prolonging their suffering and preventing their liberation. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

London - The Italian news agency dispatch from Vichy said that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will soon visit Paris in person to announce the Franco-German declaration on France's accession to the "New Europe." According to sources here, a communiqué on Franco-German cooperation may be issued in Berlin today. According to Vichy news yesterday, it was rumored that General Pétain and his cabinet had accepted the conditions recently proposed by Hitler during his talks with Darlan. Although the exact content has not been released, it is said that the German demands are actually greater than what they are prepared to give. News from Vichy and other sources all indicate that the Germans may return the administrative power of Paris to the French government and release 25 French prisoners of war. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

London - A correspondent for the Daily Mail on the French border cabled that many believe Hitler has proposed returning Paris to the Vichy government as an exchange condition for close cooperation between the two countries. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

Darlan May Visit Paris Again

Taecheng - Swiss radio said that well-informed sources in Vichy believe that the scope of Franco-German discussions is quite broad, not limited to purely economic matters. The final stage has not yet been reached. The negotiations involve France's position in the new Europe under German and Italian control. It is reported that the armistice terms will be revised, and the new demarcation line between the occupied and unoccupied zones will also be re-surveyed. There is still no definitive information on French concessions to Germany, but it is known that the German focus seems to be on opposing the creation of an Anglo-Saxon industrial group by the European industrial group, while allowing the French metallurgical and mining industries to occupy an important part in this group. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

London - Swiss radio broadcasted a Vichy report stating that Hitler recently met with Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan in Berchtesgaden. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and General Keitel were also present. Darlan, accompanied by the Nazi Ambassador to Paris, Abetz, and Mr. Fontaine of the French Ministry of Aviation, arrived in Berchtesgaden from Paris by special train. Unofficial sources in Vichy claim that Darlan will soon go to Paris again to meet with "key German officials" in order to implement the agreements that have been agreed upon in principle. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

The French Cabinet's Decision Will Be Announced Within Days

Vichy - The Cabinet discussed the various French and German issues this morning, and a decision will be announced soon, generally including the following: (1) Reducing the Franco-German burden of German troops stationed in France; (2) Redrawing the demarcation line between the French occupied zone and the free zone; (3) Releasing a portion of French prisoners of war. Darlan has prepared a report on his talks with the German authorities, which will be submitted to the government for approval. He will then go to the French occupied zone to continue talks with the German authorities. It is said that he may directly meet with the German Foreign Minister, but it is difficult to say for sure. Diplomatic observers say that the various proposals were unanimously approved at this morning's cabinet meeting. The previous rumors that the French cabinet would be reorganized after the Franco-German talks seem unlikely to become reality. According to well-informed sources, although the various resolutions passed by the cabinet meeting are practical, they are not extremely important. The main purpose of this Franco-German talks is to determine to what extent France views the European continent as the center of the situation. Both sides were very sincere during this negotiation, and the various rumors about this matter should not be believed. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Berlin - Authoritative sources said yesterday that the authorities may issue an official communiqué on the Franco-German talks today. German newspapers and officials are keeping silent on the matter. However, authoritative sources expressed satisfaction with the German-Soviet economic talks, which ended on Monday. (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)

### French侨 in Australia Hold a Meeting: A Touching Scene. Tegor Cables the Congress, Urging Increased Opposition to Vichy.

Sydney - Yesterday, at a meeting of free French citizens here, a telegram from General Tegor, the leader of the free French forces, was read, urging increased opposition to the Vichy government and saying that Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan is the German Quisling of France. The leader of the free French citizens here, Blanche, claimed that the Australian free French community is fighting alongside the French people to resist Germany. There were many touching scenes at the meeting, and people shouted "Long live France, long live Australia." (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### Churchill to Release Report on Hess's Flight to England. He is Now Being Treated as a Wounded Prisoner of War. Visitors Must Be Inspected by Police Officers.

London - Prime Minister Churchill will release a report on Hess's flight to England. Observers say that the Prime Minister may warn the people not to place excessive emotions on this matter, which is also very likely. It is now known that Hess met with the Duke after landing on the Duke of Hamilton's estate. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)

London - According to what is known today, Hitler's representative Hess met with the Duke of Hamilton within 48 hours of arriving in Scotland. A report was sent to London afterwards. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

London - It is now known that German Deputy Führer Hess flew to Scotland to meet with the Duke of Hamilton. He landed only a few miles from the Duke of Hamilton's residence. A statement issued by the German side said that, judging from the documents left by Hess, Hess wanted to meet with the Duke of Hamilton in order to establish peace between England and Germany. It was found that Hess had tried to write to the Duke a few months ago, but the Duke immediately forwarded the letter to the British authorities without replying. Before the war, the Duke had met Hess once or twice due to sports events, as both of them were interested in sports. The map left by Hess, with the route from Augsburg to Scotland marked in blue pencil, ended at Dungavel, where the Duke of Hamilton's residence is located. After landing on Saturday night, Hess asked the farmer McLennan for directions to Dungavel. Hess mistook a huge house for the Duke of Hamilton's residence. Seeing that there was no suitable place to land, he jumped out with an umbrella. Although he injured his ankle, he wanted someone to lead him to the Duke's residence, as he thought the Duke's residence was nearby. According to German news agency reports, Hess had met Hamilton at the 1936 World Games. After Hess landed, he told the villagers about the hardships he felt in Germany and the

Decline of Popular Morale

Caused by the British Air Force's Bombing. He also spoke of the suffering of German civilians. It is said that Hess also said that he had spent a lot of effort making preparations for his escape. He brought with him very important documents for the Duke of Hamilton, as well as information that was very beneficial to Britain and could help it overthrow the German tyranny. It is expected that British Prime Minister Churchill will not meet Hess. The British side now treats him as a wounded prisoner of war. Kirkpatrick, a special envoy from the Foreign Office who went to see Hess, has not yet returned to London. It is expected that Churchill will soon be able to continue to make statements on this matter in the House of Commons. It is said that Hess contributed a lot to Hitler's book "Mein Kampf." There are two main points in the book: one is not to fight against Britain, and the other is to oppose communism. Now that Hitler has violated this doctrine and started a war against Britain and formed an alliance with the Soviet Union, Hess adheres to the doctrine that others cannot match. As a result, he was greatly disappointed and had to

Escape Into Europe's

Only Safe Country. It is said that Hess left a letter blaming Hitler for breaking his principles. As for Hess's arrival in England indicating that Germany is now in its final struggle, it is not very convincing. Hess came here perhaps because he did not agree with the German war government and believed that he could propose peace terms between the two countries. However, it can be said with certainty that Britain is determined to fight to the end until it wins, and even if Hess makes this proposal, it will not have any impact in Britain. According to a Berlin dispatch from the Basler Zeitung, Berlin officials admitted that there were absolutely no signs of mental disorder in the letter left by Hess. However, they warned the people not to believe the news about Hess from Britain, saying that Britain would use this matter for propaganda purposes, and that the remarks made by Hess that Britain had conveyed were made under duress. Yesterday, the Scottish police specially dispatched police officers to inspect those entering the hospital to visit Hess. Military police were stationed at the hospital entrance, and no one was allowed to enter without special permission. Many filmmakers surrounded the Scottish farmer McLennan, asking him to perform

Hess's Arrest

The circumstances at the time. McLennan declined, saying, "I don't want to be a movie star. I don't have time for this." The filmmakers then told him to come back later. McLennan replied, "The work of a farmer is never finished, so it is impossible to come back later." Then, because the filmmakers continued to pester him, he said, "You might as well take pictures of me while I'm farming." After finishing the matter, McLennan said to the photographers, "You guys came here to make me stop working, which is more troublesome than those Germans." (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### Saving Movement Promoted in Mongolia, Tibet and Border Provinces. Although Started Later, Achievements are Good. People in Guerrilla Areas Eagerly Purchase Bonds.

Chongqing - Recently, the total amount of savings in the country has increased to 300 million yuan. In order to make all parties understand the widespread promotion situation, the Savings Promotion Association specially released information on the promotion of savings in Mongolia, Tibet, border provinces, and guerrilla areas as follows. The Mongolian and Tibetan regions are located on the borders and were mobilized later. However, their enthusiasm for responding to the savings movement is commendable. In Lhasa, the central government of Tibet, and Yulin, the southern part of Inner Mongolia, Mongolian and Tibetan people are enthusiastically purchasing savings bonds. According to the report of the Savings Group of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission at the end of last December, the amount was 120,000 yuan. It is estimated that it has recently multiplied. In addition, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xikang provinces have established savings and transportation agencies early on. The counties of Suiyuan Province that have not been invaded are promoted by members sent by the Shaanxi Savings Promotion Branch. Under the principle that the provincial savings group accounts for 60% and the promotion accounts for 40%, more than 130,000 yuan has been collected. In Shanxi, a guerrilla province, Japanese soldiers have invaded and there is almost no safe land. The provincial savings group operates in difficult circumstances and has also accumulated 200,000 yuan in savings. Most guerrilla areas in various provinces have established savings promotion branches. Yueyang in Hunan belongs to the Japanese guerrilla area and is also promoted by the Xiang Savings Group. Although these numbers are not very large, they are sufficient to reflect the widespread promotion of savings and the enthusiasm of the participants, which is of great significance. (Dispatch, 15th)

### Chongqing Press Celebrates Ta Kung Pao Winning US Medal

Chongqing - Ta Kung Pao won the medal from the Missouri School of Journalism in the United States. The Chinese Journalism Association and the Chongqing Newspapers Joint Committee held a tea party at the Central Party Headquarters at 4 pm on the 15th to celebrate. Colleagues from all over the country sent congratulatory telegrams. Presidents Dai and Yu both wrote congratulatory messages. The Central Daily News editorial stated that Ta Kung Pao's award is an honor for the entire Chinese journalism community. This medal shows our glorious record and is also a symbol of our responsibility. In addition to broadcasting a speech to the American people, which was rebroadcast by the American Broadcasting Corporation, Ta Kung Pao also published an article titled "Statement by Our Staff," which briefly stated that today's celebration shows that the Chinese press has gained sympathetic recognition internationally, and in the future, it can cooperate with the press of various countries, especially the American press, in secret.

### The United Kingdom and the United States Plan to Send Experts to China

Chongqing - According to reports, in addition to providing material assistance to China, the United Kingdom and the United States also plan to send many experts to China. The Chinese government is currently preparing dormitories for the experts in various transportation centers. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

New York - According to reliable sources, several American ships, carrying military supplies and weapons to support the British Middle East Army, are en route. They are preparing to paint the American flag clearly on the decks and sides of the ships and hoist high lights before sailing into the Red Sea. So far, no American ships have sailed into the Red Sea. The first ship is about to sail in. (Note: German leader Hitler announced yesterday that the Red Sea has been designated as a war zone.) (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Berlin - Neutral observers here recently warned the United States that if American ships sail in the Red Sea, they will immediately become targets of assassination by German aircraft. It is expected that there will be more German aircraft activity in this non-area. The observers also pointed out that German aircraft groups fiercely attacked British troops in the Solun area yesterday. They also recalled that German bombers had attacked Alexandria and Suez, and may immediately step up their attacks in these areas. The neutral observers also believe that Germany's declaration of the Red Sea as a war zone is very important. They also pointed out that if the United States, as Washington has reported, ignores German warnings and sails in the Red Sea, then American ships will immediately become targets of attack by German aircraft in Africa and Greece. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)

Washington - Secretary of State Hull, when receiving journalists today, refused to make any criticism of Germany's declaration of the Red Sea as a war zone and the extension of the blockade line to the Red Sea. As for the rumors that Germany has decided to set up a counter-blockade line on the sea near Danish Greenland, Hull also said that the State Department has not received formal notification from Germany, and even if it does, the government will refuse to recognize it. The Pan-American Conference has already decided that no third country should be allowed to establish a war zone in the Western Hemisphere. In short, both countries will not recognize the new war zone declared by Germany. According to well-informed sources, President Roosevelt had previously announced that the Red Sea would no longer be listed as a war zone, allowing American ships to sail there. At this time, there is no intention to change the above decision. American ships will continue to carry aid to Britain through the Red Sea, because 75% of British merchant ships that have had accidents are the result of the activities of German submarines and raiders. However, there is no such threat in the Red Sea. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Idle Talk of the European War (5) (6): A Record of the Great Fire of London

London experienced a great fire in 1666, which burned for seven days and seven nights. On December 29, 1940, a large number of German aircraft raided London at night, causing another great fire. The following is a translation of the special dispatches from "The New York Times" and "Reader's Digest":

Britain now has a new defense line, and that is on the rooftops of the entire country. The enemy being defended against is "fire." In the middle of the night, alarms blared, and the incendiary bombs and small bombs dropped by the first batch of enemy aircraft burst into flames on various buildings. If they are not extinguished immediately, then a single spark can start a prairie fire, inevitably leading to a major disaster, and the blazing fire will allow bombers carrying powerful explosives to see their targets clearly. Kang Wenjie Laicheng has already suffered a painful lesson once.

Fire prevention lookout teams have now been organized throughout Britain, specializing in managing rooftops and extinguishing incendiary bombs dropped by enemy aircraft to prevent the spread of fire. If properly equipped and acting quickly, it can be quickly successful in eliminating a burning bomb. The problem is that someone should be on watch in every house, and this point has been resolved by special organizations in commercial and residential areas.

In large stores, employers can order employees to take turns guarding at night, paying attention to the falling of incendiary bombs. Each employee performs this obligation for no more than 48 hours per month. Small shops can take a mutual defense system, with employees from each shop taking responsibility for guarding. Rooftop guards in large apartments and hotels are not only employed but can also be recruited from guests. Fire prevention lookouts in large stores are compulsory, because in large-scale air raids, unmanned places at night often turn into scorched earth, and neighboring houses are also affected.

As for residential areas, because most houses are occupied during the most dangerous bombing times, fire prevention lookouts are purely voluntary, and people volunteer. Housewives are always prepared to use fire extinguishers and sand to defend against incendiary bombs. Neighbors often form patrols to resist the threat of fire from the sky.

On the night when German aircraft attempted to burn down London, which was last year's December 29th night, the reporter and Miss Magley watched Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" movie together. Magley is 25 years old, with a beautiful appearance. She is a half-English, half-French girl who can speak both English and French. She often works for the Paris Morning News. She escaped from Paris only one step ahead of the German army, then ran to London, and is still working as a female reporter.

The movie started at 4:30, and just as the fourth reel started, we suddenly heard the air raid siren blaring. A notice appeared on the screen stating that viewers who wanted to leave could leave and hide in the air raid shelter, but no one left. Fifteen minutes later, we felt that the entire box was shaking back and forth, presumably because a large bomb had fallen nearby, causing the vibration. Although none of us said anything, we knew that the situation outside the theater must be very tense.

At 7 o'clock, when the movie was over, we left the theater and felt that the situation in the city was unprecedented. London seemed to have turned into Rome as shown in Cecil B. DeMille's "The Sign of the Cross" colorful film. The sky was a red light, mixed with clusters of orange flames. Although it was already dusk, it was as bright as day, and the thick lip gloss on Miss Magley's lips was clearly visible.

We were going to have dinner, but Magley first wanted to go to the newspaper office to proofread a news draft she had written in the afternoon. There was no one in the entire office. Finally, we found that all the office staff were in the basement, accompanied by the machine's roll of paper. They were proofreading. That house was not very sturdy, so they all ran into the basement and only came out after the falling bombs were scarce. Magley finished proofreading the new draft, and we set off together to look for restaurants that had not closed.

The pedestrians on the street mostly looked flustered. When they heard the whistling sound of bombs nearby, they ran away. However, Magley did not want to run with the crowd. The red light in Cecil B. DeMille's film shone on everything. You could see everyone's face and see who was frightened and what their expression was when they were frightened, but there were really few people who were not flustered. (To be continued)

### US Ambassador Left Shanghai for Hong Kong Yesterday: Rumor of Important Meeting. Only Ambassador Johnson and Several Others Attended. General Review of Aid to China Policy.

The new US Ambassador to China, Gauss, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge liner at about 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. After staying here overnight, he took the original liner to Hong Kong at 11:30 a.m. yesterday morning to transfer to Chongqing to take office. The new Counselor of the US Embassy, Mr. Butlerick, accompanied him. Earlier, at about 10:00 a.m., the Ambassador and the Counselor drove from the Hwa Yuan Hotel to the New Customs Wharf to wait for the ferry to cross the large liner. US Consul General Lockhart, the US Yangtze River Fleet and Fourth Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Glassford, Colonel Bay, US Overseas Association President Dr. Mindstedt, US Chamber of Commerce President Nichols, and US China Judicial Office Judge Halmik all went to see him off. Gauss shook hands with the well-wishers one by one and then boarded the ferry. At 10:30, the whistle sounded long and they said goodbye to each other. The President Coolidge sailed out of the port at 11:30 a.m. yesterday morning and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow morning. The Ambassador may stay in Hong Kong for a while before flying with Counselor Butt to Chongqing to take office.

Rumor in Hong Kong

Call a Meeting

It is also learned that Ambassador Gauss's trip to Hong Kong via Shanghai and then to Chongqing to take office will involve a considerable stay in Hong Kong to convene an important meeting of senior US Far East officials. Among those attending will be Dr. Johnson, the former US Ambassador to China, who arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing the day before yesterday. Mr. Weimer, Second Secretary of the US Embassy, and Naval Attaché McHughes accompanied Mr. Johnson to Hong Kong. Also, the Commander of the US Army Air Corps in the Philippines, Claggett, flew to Hong Kong from the Philippines the day before yesterday. Therefore, it is generally believed that once Ambassador Gauss and Counselor Butt arrive in Hong Kong, a historic military and diplomatic meeting will be held in Hong Kong. If Gauss's ambassadorship is a symbol of the United States' intensification of aid to China, then this meeting can be said to be the forerunner in the overall decision of the actual aid to China. All parties highly estimate the importance of this meeting. Although Mr. Gauss denied the rumor that the five countries of China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Australia, and Burma would hold a military meeting in Singapore when he passed through Shanghai, the importance of the Hong Kong meeting is even greater than the rumored "Singapore meeting".

Naval Attaché

Also Traveled Together Yesterday

In addition to Counselor Butlerick, Naval Attaché Commander Crayton and Assistant Naval Attaché Lieutenant Williams also accompanied Ambassador Gauss to Hong Kong yesterday. Although Mr. Krewer's destination is Manila, he will participate in a meeting of important officials when passing through Hong Kong. Therefore, it is estimated that at least eight people will participate in the meeting: Gauss, Johnson, Butlerick, Crayton, Williams, Weimer, McHughes, and Claggett. It is not yet known whether British officials will send personnel to participate, but in any case, US officials in Hong Kong will definitely attend the meeting to discuss the issue. It is generally believed that this summit meeting will not only discuss the most effective methods of assisting China but will also thoroughly consider and decide on the situation in the South Pacific to cope with the new situation in the Far East after the establishment of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact. Ambassador Gauss will fly to Chongqing after the meeting and must take office by the end of the month at the latest. Johnson will wait for an opportunity to fly to the United States and then go to Australia to take office after consulting with the Vice President. =

Ambassador Johnson

Praises the New Appointee

Hong Kong, 15th (United Press) - Retiring US Ambassador to China Johnson praised the new US Ambassador to China, Gauss, today. Johnson told visitors, "Gauss is truly the most qualified person I know to succeed me in my mission." Johnson expressed regret at leaving China and said that China is his second hometown. He said, "I am married here, my children were also born here, and I have many friends here. Under the circumstances, I feel as if I am severing the closest ties."

### Shanghai Municipal Council Budget Shortfall: Plan to Raise Public Bonds

Reportedly Discussed by Japanese Newspaper

New Electricity Reduction Regulations Also Agreed Upon

According to yesterday's Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun", the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting at 4:30 PM on the 14th to discuss raising public bonds for the current year to offset the budget deficit, levying entertainment taxes, and actively implementing electricity reductions at the request of the Shanghai Power Company due to coal shortages. It was reported that although tax increases were implemented at the beginning of the year, the budget shortfall still reached a massive eight million yuan. To make up for this, it was decided to raise nine million yuan in public bonds. The interest rate terms and collateral will be formulated by the Municipal Council and announced later. Furthermore, it was decided to levy a surcharge of approximately 10% on admission tickets to entertainment venues such as cinemas and theaters within the Settlement. Finally, the meeting discussed the Shanghai Power Company's request to actively implement electricity reductions, recognizing the validity of the company's claims. It was decided to implement a 50% electricity reduction for various large consumers as originally proposed.

### Yu Fugeng Dies of Serious Injuries

Yu Fugeng, the Chinese Detective Chief Inspector and Acting Superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Police's old Detective Division, was shot and assassinated in front of the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road at approximately 5 PM the day before yesterday. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Despite the best efforts of doctors from Renji Hospital and the Municipal Council Hospital, he succumbed to excessive blood loss and brain damage. Furthermore, due to Yu's advanced age, blood transfusions were ineffective. He passed away at 7:10 AM yesterday. Yu joined the Municipal Council on April 26, 1910, and rose through the ranks from Chinese Constable No. 399 to his current position, serving for 30 years. He was loyal to his duties and amiable. His unfortunate death has been widely mourned. Yu's remains have been sent to the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road and will be encoffined on the 18th of this month. Senior Chinese and Western officials from the Police Department will attend the funeral.

### New Commander of US Marine Corps: Howard Takes Office Yesterday

Troop Inspection Scheduled for Tomorrow Morning at the Racecourse

Baker to Reportedly Return to the US by Ship Next Week

Colonel Howard, the new commander of the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the USS Chaumont the day before yesterday (the 14th). Yesterday (the 15th), he succeeded Colonel Baker as commander of the regiment. No ceremony was held during the handover. Howard will conduct his first inspection of the US Fourth Marine Regiment on Saturday morning (tomorrow). The entire regiment of American soldiers will be fully armed and will drill at the racecourse polo field, receiving inspection from the new and outgoing commanders. The American Community Federation, the American Chamber of Commerce, and US military officers are scheduled to host banquets for both Howard and Baker next Monday and Tuesday, welcoming the new commander and bidding farewell to the old. The official announcement of Baker's departure date has not yet been made, but it is reported that he will leave Shanghai on the USS Chaumont on Wednesday. Baker has been in Shanghai for over a year and has a wide circle of acquaintances. It is expected that government officials and civilians of various countries who know Baker will go to the pier to see him off. Baker came to Shanghai in February of last year to serve as the commander of the US military. He is known for his composure and decisiveness. Last summer, the US military arrested armed plainclothes Japanese personnel at the International Hotel. Baker's handling of the situation was appropriate and highly praised by all sectors of Shanghai and the United States. A New York dispatch referred to him as the "guardian of the foremost outpost of America in the Far East." Other American newspapers have also praised him.

### Bombing of Train Between Chang'an and Jianqiao Confirmed

The English-language "China Press" reports that Japanese authorities announced today (the 15th) that a passenger train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line struck a landmine and exploded on Tuesday afternoon between Chang'an and Jianqiao. The engine and baggage car derailed. Several passengers were injured by shattered glass, but there were no fatalities. Traffic was restored to normal several hours later after the tracks were cleared. It is reported that the train was one of the new express trains recently introduced on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Several passenger cars were not directly affected by the explosion, allowing passengers to escape danger. However, the baggage car was completely destroyed. The work of clearing the wreckage was still in progress this morning. Japanese authorities stated that they are continuing to investigate the case and have found some electrical wires at the scene of the incident, which they believe were used to detonate the landmine.

### Warehouses Increase Storage Fees: Cracking Down on Hoarders

Taigoo Wharf, Blue Funnel Wharf, Wheelock Wharf, Lung Mow & Co., Kung Hoong Wharf, Shanghai Dock & Warehouse Co., and other warehouses in Shanghai have increased their storage fees for goods starting yesterday (the 15th). The additional fee is 300% for the first month and 400% for the second month. The new prices will apply to all warehouse receipts, regardless of the date issued, until June 15th. The increased warehouse fees are an effective blow to unscrupulous merchants who hoard goods for speculative purposes.

### Current Situation in the Suburbs of Ningbo

After Ningbo fell on the 20th of last month, looting occurred that evening due to bad elements. The Chen Sheng Wine Shop outside the West Gate suffered losses of over 200,000 yuan, and the Da Youfeng General Merchandise Store lost 700,000 yuan. A Mr. Xiang, from the Hunan business community, who conducted business in Ningbo under the Xiang Ji name, suffered losses of several million yuan, as he had a large amount of goods awaiting shipment in the Ningbo urban area, Hengxi, Shipu, and other places, all of which were looted. The Yongyao Electric Light Company, having reorganized earlier as a German company, did not evacuate and resumed lighting from the evening of the 21st. The Zhongma Bridge is intact and undamaged. The Xinjiang Bridge was hit by one shell, causing one row to collapse. When the Japanese troops entered the city, they used two Shandong-style wooden boats placed under the raft to repair it, which is now passable. No bombs fell inside the city. The rumor that a bomb hit the Drum Tower is not true.

### Port Rice Has Been Released from Warehouses

Black Market at the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange Ordered to Shut Down

The Shanghai Municipal Council's first batch of over 50,000 bags of subsidized Hong Kong rice has now been unloaded. The distributing procedures handled by the Leki & Co. have issued payment and delivery notices to various rice shops, requiring them to pay the goods to the Cheung Mow & Co. within three days, to get the warehouse receipts in order to release the goods. Therefore, various rice shops actively went to Cheung Mow & Co. yesterday to settle the payment of goods. With these procedures completed, the delivery of goods will begin today, and sales can start tomorrow. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship has not yet arrived due to the bad weather yesterday, and should arrive today with Chap Holme Company's Fu Sheng ship.

Payment for Rice

Best to Prepare Banker's Drafts

According to reports from Ping Ming News, Cheung Mow & Co. issued a total of over 10,000 bags yesterday, of which Thai Yu had over 6,000 bags, which were more than most. Many shops who tried to pay by cash and checks were refused. According to the person in charge of the Cheung Mow Co., the funds are directly transferred to the Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), and HSBC does not accept checks. Cash also requires a handling fee of 15 yuan per 10,000 yuan. Therefore, for the various rice shops that go to pay for the goods, it is best to use a banker's draft from a bank or money shop. After the rice shops pay for the goods, in addition to receiving the bill of lading from Cheung Mow & Co., the company will also issue a rectangular piece of thick cardboard, written in Chinese and English: "This store sells Shanghai Municipal Council foreign rice, current market price of 110 yuan per picul", so that each rice shop can hang it when selling.

Amount of Rice

Calculated by Weight

Rice shops which have the bill of lading, can go to the Taikoo Warehouse to release the goods from the miscellaneous grains shops, and go to the Roosevelt Warehouse to release the goods from the rice shops. The subsidized Hong Kong rice being sold this time is 133.5 yuan per bag, and the weight is 224 pounds. The Shanghai Municipal Council has entrusted Babli Sen Davies & Co. at No. 2 Beijing Road and San Y Co. at No. 12 The Bund to handle the weighing procedures. If the weight of each bag of Hong Kong rice is less than 224 pounds, the rice shops can take the weight certificate from San Y Co. and Babli Sen Davies & Co. to Cheung Mow & Co. at No. 20 Guangdong Road to get a refund for the weight shortfall. If each bag exceeds 224 pounds, the rice shops will still need to pay the additional cost.

Afternoon Black Market

Stopped Immediately

The afternoon rice sales in the Edouard Road Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Exchange have been repeatedly ordered to be prohibited by the authorities of the two settlements. However, due to the lack of cooperation and compliance, it has not been eliminated. Instead, it has become more rampant. Now, the French Concession authorities, seeing that it is their responsibility and not willing to sit idly by, have not only ordered their staff to monitor illegal transactions in the field, but also ordered the Miscellaneous Grain Association to strictly stop it. The Association announced to the market yesterday: "The French Concession authorities ordered that from today onwards, all rice transactions, whether spot or futures, or those recognized by the authorities of the two settlements, are not allowed to be bought and sold in this market (including foreign firms). If anyone dares to violate it, they will be arrested and prosecuted without leniency. A collective compliance with this order is required. Do not neglect."

### Rice Cart Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning

Police Protected Warehouses and Arrested Detectives

Rice Transportation Resumed as Usual

Over a thousand rice cart workers went on strike on the morning of the 12th because their request to manage the rice transportation was not fulfilled. The next day, riots and disturbances broke out. After two mediations by the Shanghai Municipal Council, all parties were able to understand each other, so the resolution could proceed smoothly. It was agreed that the large and small rice would be transported by the handcarts. 40% of the large rice would be pulled by the handcarts, and the rest would be transported by trucks. The labor-capital agreement could have been signed immediately, but since the Rice Shop Association still needed to be decided through a meeting, and the porters (contracting rice) were invited to meet, it was decided to sign at the Shanghai Municipal Council next Monday. The striking workers officially resumed work as usual at 8:00 AM yesterday. The Shanghai Municipal Council's detectives guarding the warehouses immediately withdrew. As for the 26 striking workers who were arrested during the disturbance on the 13th, they were sent to the First Special Court Criminal Court and sentenced to seven days of hard labor each. If they are converted into fines, two yuan will offset one day of imprisonment. Yesterday, they had already paid the fines and were released.

### Former President of Hankou Chamber of Commerce, Chen Jingshu, Arrested

Chen Jingshu, the former president of the Hankou Chamber of Commerce and current Councilor of the National Government, came to Shanghai with his family after the August 13th Incident and settled at No. 35 Shafei Road, Xiuhua Lane. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese side sent personnel to the French Concession Police to request that Chinese and Western detectives be dispatched to Chen's residence. Chen was arrested while sleeping in bed and taken to the French General Police Station for investigation. It is reported that Chen was originally a businessman, and the government appointed him as a Councilor because he was usually upright. However, Chen had never participated in political work, although he accepted the appointment. He is now in Shanghai and is very concerned about various charities. The reason for his sudden arrest is unknown. It is reported that Chen is still detained in the French General Police Station and has not been extradited by the Japanese. They are investigating his daily activities in detail.

In 1939, it had increased to more than 1,500. According to custom, "Foreign Trade Week always includes 'American Maritime Day' on May 22nd." This holiday was established by the American Congress to commemorate the departure of the American ship Savannah in May 1819, which was the first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

### Soviet Consular Interests in Shanghai Taken Over by Soviet Ambassador to Japan

No Longer Handled by Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai

Shanghai Report by TASS: Officials announced that Soviet consular interests in Shanghai, previously temporarily handled by the Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai, have now been directly managed by the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo. The announcement was signed by Director Zaitsev of the Consular Department of the Soviet Embassy in Japan and authorized to be published by the Far East Branch of TASS. The announcement reads as follows: "For the purpose of notification, from this date, I have taken over the Soviet consular interests in Shanghai from the Norwegian Consul-General.

### USS Henderson to Carry American Soldiers Home

Over One Hundred Soldiers Stationed in Tianjin and Peking Complete Their Service

Free Passage on Ship to Return to US via Shanghai

The US Navy transport ship USS Henderson, coming from the United States via Manila and North China, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on May 24th. At the same time, rumors are circulating in Shanghai that the strength of the US Fourth Marine Regiment will be reduced, but this claim has not been officially confirmed. It is reported that the USS Henderson will arrive in Shanghai from Qinhuangdao, will only stay for 24 hours, and will depart the next day for San Francisco via Manila, Guam, and Honolulu.

North China American Military

123 American Marines stationed in North China, including 70 stationed in Beijing and 53 stationed in Tianjin, have completed their service in the East and are scheduled to board the USS Henderson in Qinhuangdao on May 20th to return to the United States. US officials in Shanghai are keeping the number of American soldiers being transferred back to the United States secret, but unofficial sources say that approximately 300 people will return to the country on the USS Henderson.

Substitute Soldiers Carried

To Fill the Defense in Shanghai

It is expected that the ship will carry substitute soldiers to fill the defense in Shanghai, but it is still questionable whether the number of substitute soldiers will exceed 100. It is reported that all but the drummers and buglers of the US Marine Corps Band originally stationed at the US Embassy in Beijing have been transferred, and some of them will come to Shanghai to replace the Fourth Marine Regiment. There are also some members of the Fourth Marine Regiment Band who will be transferred back to the United States.

Passing Shanghai

Staying for Only One Day

In addition, sailors of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet who have completed their service in the East will also return to the country on the USS Henderson. In the past, US transport ships would stay in port for about ten days. However, the USS Henderson will only be moored for one day this time. Another US transport ship, the USS Chaumont, also only stayed briefly when it passed through Shanghai earlier this year. Traditionally, the two ships alternate their voyages to the East, but since May of last year, the USS Henderson is making its first voyage to the Far East, while the USS Chaumont has made three consecutive voyages.

### Coal Prices Rising Frequently

According to news from the various coal business associations yesterday, large quantities of coal briquettes will arrive in Shanghai around the middle of this month. Also, there are shipments arriving daily. The numbers are not small. The average amount arriving with each shipment is around 5,000 tons. However, amidst this news of the abundance of coal, the price of white coal is still being driven up frequently. These speculators are not competing to purchase large quantities of coal in the market. They are secretly grabbing long-term warehouse receipts, planning to hold onto them and sell them at high prices. As for the price of coal balls, it remains at 296 yuan per ton.

### Norwegian Community Holds National Day Commemoration Amid National Crisis

Tomorrow is Norway's Constitution Day. The Norwegian community in Shanghai is extremely motivated and determined to restore their country as they commemorate National Day amidst the national crisis. At 5:00 PM tomorrow, a commemorative service will be held at the Foreign Cemetery on Avenue Joffre. From 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM, Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires and Mrs. Nordenson will host a reception for all Norwegians in Shanghai at their private residence at No. 111 Columbia Road. From 8:30 PM, a broadcast will be held at the Democracy Radio Station. From 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, there will still be a broadcast on that station, promoting the Norwegian aircraft purchase donation. Earlier, at 9:20 AM, Norwegian Consul Giddell will give a commemorative speech at the Hua Mei Electric Cooperation.

### Domestic Goods Certification Offices to Open Simultaneously in Shanghai and Hong Kong

Representatives from the China National Goods Industry Service Society and the Chinese Manufacturers Association met with Minister of Economics, Weng Wenhao, when he left, to request guidance on organizing domestic goods certification offices. Minister Weng expressed his approval and provided detailed guidance. The date when they can start issuing certificates depends on when Minister Weng formally approves its establishment and commences work. It is expected that the review and certification work can begin at the end of this month. At that time, exports of domestic goods from both Shanghai and Hong Kong will be certified in the same way.

### British Merchant Ships on Yangtze River Ordered to Sail South in Succession

Concentrated in Singapore to Await Repairs and Deployment

Ships Moored in Hankou and Yichang Still Unable to Sail

Since the outbreak of war, the Yangtze River has been blockaded. Since the Chinese military evacuated Hankou, the entire Yangtze River has been under control. Foreign ships have been forced to stop and anchor, with many anchored in Hankou, and subject to strict surveillance. They are restricted to their original mooring places and cannot move without permission from the Japanese authorities. This has been the case for three years. However, the Taikoo Company's Wulin ship was replaced by the Wuhu ship to carry British troops transferred from Hankou back to Shanghai. Recently, in mid-March of this year, two Dutch ships and one Portuguese ship were specially permitted by the Japanese Navy to be released and return to Shanghai, as reported previously. Now, due to the escalation of the European war, the British Admiralty is requisitioning many merchant ships. Ships sailing in the Far East have been restricted. The Taikoo Company's Beiyang-class Shenjing ship was also ordered to go to Singapore last month to await deployment. The Jardine Matheson and Taikoo companies' ships on the Shanghai-Yangtze River route that were docked in Shanghai have been sailing south in succession. Jardine Matheson's last ship to leave Shanghai, the Tonghe ship, left for Hong Kong and Singapore at the end of last month. The Taikoo Company's Huangpu and Wulin ships sailed to Hong Kong and then Singapore on the 4th of this month. The company's last Jiang River ship to withdraw, the Wanyuan, also left Shanghai for Hong Kong this Tuesday (the 13th), and then headed to Singapore. The Jiang River ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo companies parked in Shanghai have all left the port and sailed south. It is reported that the ships docked in the Yangtze River are still unable to move. At present, Jardine Matheson has the Longhe and Shihe ships on the Hankou and Fujiang River, and Taikoo has the Wuhu, Wusong, and Changsha ships. In the Yichang area, Jardine Matheson has the Jianghe, Xinchanghe, and Qinghe ships, and Taikoo has the Shashi, Xiangtan, Wanxian, and Wanmu ships. The British ships in Hankou and Yichang do not have any hope of sailing downriver at this time.

### Murder on Seymour Road and Wuding Road: Wang Zhengshao Shot Dead - Lawyer and Employee of Xiang Sheng Motors - Died in Ambush After Car Broke Down

At 1:45 PM yesterday, a murder occurred on Seymour Road and Wuding Road in the Public Settlement. The victim, Wang Zhengshao, a lawyer, was shot three times and died on the spot. The details of the case are as follows:

Practicing Law

Lawyer Wang Zhengshao, styled Yiyun, was a native of Zheng County, Zhejiang Province, aged 40. He joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association in July of the 17th year of the Republic of China and practiced law, with an office on the 4th floor of the Guohua Bank Building at No. 356 Beijing Road. His residence in Shanghai was No. 4 Anyi Lane, Seymour Road, Wuding Road. He graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tungwu University. In addition to his law practice, he also served as chairman of Xiang Sheng Motors and the White Palace Funeral Home on Great Western Road. He usually used a car with license plate number 2121 for transportation.

Shot Three Times

At 1:45 PM yesterday, Wang left his residence by car after lunch, intending to go to his office. Shortly after leaving the lane, the car's engine broke down when it reached the intersection and could not be driven. The driver got out to check and repair the car. Unexpectedly, a man wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants suddenly produced a pistol and fired several shots at Wang. Wang was hit by one bullet in the head and two in the chest and immediately fell into a pool of blood, barely breathing. The shooter fled and disappeared without a trace.

Died of Serious Injuries

The nearby patrol officers arrived upon hearing the alarm and, seeing the murder, reported it to the police station. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to the scene, but a thorough search yielded nothing. Wang was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment but died shortly after arriving due to the critical nature of his injuries. The police station is currently conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the murder. It is reported that Wang's family has decided to send his body to the Anle Funeral Home for burial at a later date.

Impoverished and Sick

### Two Rickshaw Pullers, Uncle and Nephew, Drown Themselves in Well

Zhu Xiaohe (40 years old) and Xu Bao (18 years old), uncle and nephew, rickshaw pullers living in a rickshaw shed in Baoan Lane No. 17, Lane 126, Route Sœurcères in Lokawei, have recently been suffering from illness. Not only were they unable to seek medical treatment, but their illness also prevented them from earning a living, putting them in an extremely impoverished and sick state. They both conceived the idea of ending their lives. On the night of the 14th, the uncle and nephew went out together and committed suicide by jumping into a public well at the entrance of Baoan Lane No. 13, where they lived. It was late at night, and in a secluded place, no one noticed that night. It was not until 10:00 AM yesterday morning that their landlord, Tang Zhifang, discovered them and reported it to the French police. Detectives were dispatched to investigate, and the two bodies were recovered and sent to the morgue for examination before burial.

### Two Suspects in Checker Murder Case Die of Illness

Chen Guohua, a checker for the French Tram Company, was shot and killed on a No. 21 public bus on Rue du Père Robert on June 27 of last year. After arresting the perpetrator, Lu Rusheng, on the spot, another thirty people were successively arrested, including ticket sellers and drivers who had stopped working at the company, such as Hu Shengxiang, Bian Jintang, Yu Dianchen, etc., and investigated and sent to the court for prosecution for murder. Wang Yaozhong and Zheng Chengliang were two people in the case. They were released on bail for medical treatment due to serious illness while in custody. Wang died in February of this year. Now Zheng Bingliang also died at his residence at No. 49 Rue Bourget yesterday due to serious illness despite medical treatment. The guarantor, Dong Wenli, reported this to the French police after learning about it. Detectives were dispatched to investigate and the body of Zheng was sent to the morgue to be examined to discharge the responsibility of the guarantor.

### Dancer Robbed on the Street

After the two Shi sisters, Yiping and Xiaoping, who were dancers at the Victory Ballroom on Beijing Road, transferred to the Far East Ballroom on Yu Xiaqing Road this spring, their business boomed. However, the two Shi sisters had a contract with the Victory Ballroom for a term that had not yet expired. Chen Jiying, the owner of the Victory Ballroom, believed that they had breached the contract, resulting in a loss of more than 3,000 yuan. He hired a lawyer to apply to the Civil Division of the First Special Court for mediation, but it was unsuccessful. He then formally filed a lawsuit, which will be heard in court soon. However, when Shi Yiping was walking through the intersection of Hainan Road and North Zhejiang Road at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a bandit named Zhou Zhi, a native of Nanjing, suddenly came forward and snatched her wallet. A Chinese constable saw this and helped chase after the thief, recovering the stolen goods and arresting him. He was taken to the Huishi Police Station and sent to the Criminal Court Three of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Jiang Baolian, the police station's lawyer, filed a lawsuit according to law. After interrogating Zhou, the judge ordered Zhou to be detained pending a scheduled verdict. The stolen goods were first returned.

### Business Representatives Confer with Capital Representatives Yesterday

The labor dispute at the Commercial Press has lasted for more than twenty days without resolution. Yesterday, the representatives of the factory workers again sent representatives to meet with Mr. Li Bojia, the special commissioner dispatched by Hong Kong to resolve the dispute. As Mr. Li was out, Shi Jiuyun received them on his behalf, stating that General Manager Wang was very distressed about the current labor unrest. As for the actual situation in Shanghai, Mr. Li had reported to Hong Kong via express mail. A telegram from Hong Kong indicated that concrete measures were on the way and should arrive in Shanghai in about a week. Furthermore, it was announced that the salary for the first half of May would be paid at 9:00 AM today, according to the previous method. The representatives then inquired about the company's policy for resolving the dispute. Mr. Shi replied that the company would still handle the matter according to the announcements previously issued. The representatives, with a sincere attitude, hoped that the company would seek a reasonable solution, withdraw the order to transfer personnel, and expressed their strong position.

Colored Printing Labor Dispute May Soon Be Resolved

The colored printing industry in this city has been experiencing a strike since the 9th, which has lasted for a week. Labor and management held negotiations once on the 9th, but no results were achieved. It is now known that more than ten companies, including Dahua (previously mistakenly written as Dihua), Xiesheng, Zhonghua, and Sida Sanyi, have requested Zhuang Ping to act as a mediator. Negotiations were held once yesterday, and progress was considered smooth. A satisfactory resolution is expected roughly within today or tomorrow.

### Rumor that the Municipal Council Will Levy Additional Entertainment Tax

According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, the Public Concession's Municipal Council, in order to make up for budget shortfalls, is considering levying an additional tax of about 10% on tickets for theaters and cinemas within the concession as a way to increase revenue. It has already notified relevant agencies of this intention. It is rumored that the Hongkou area will also be handled in the same way. However, cinemas in the Hongkou area believe that increasing ticket prices by 10% is a considerable amount, which will greatly affect public entertainment, and have submitted a written objection.

### Pushen Villa Announces Last Year's Burial of Nearly 30,000 Exposed Corpses

The benefits to society will be boundless.

### Grains: Imported Rice's Decline Has Become a Certainty

There was still no sign of change for imported rice yesterday. Although domestic rice showed a swirling situation, futures prices fell again due to the impact of cheaper rice batches. With too many floating chips of broken rice, there was a rush to sell, and the market was seen as tired and unable to recover. The opening price for Yinghua Si broken rice (one shi and two dou and a half) yesterday morning was 108.5 yuan, similar to the low price quoted the previous night, and slightly less than the opening price the previous afternoon. Because there were more sellers than buyers, it immediately dropped from 107 yuan, 6 yuan, to as little as 105 yuan, a huge drop of 5.5 yuan compared to the previous afternoon. Small Jiaoyuan bao (one shi and two dou and a half) also opened lower at 138 yuan, Saigon No. 2 at only 136 yuan, and No. 1 dropped from an opening price of 140 yuan to as little as 136.5 yuan, all slightly lower than the previous day. The opening of domestic rice was already weak and lifeless, and the opening price was weaker than the evening market of the previous day. However, as local buyers inquired and major players held their ground, the market stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, floating holders sought to sell due to nervousness, and the market softened. Total trading volume was more than 7,000 bags, Yinghua Si 8-900 tons, Saigon No. 1 123 yuan to 121 yuan, No. 2 115.5 yuan to 114.5 yuan, Small Jiaoyuan 115 yuan to 112 yuan, Min Dang 116 yuan to 114 yuan, broken rice 90 yuan, down to 78 yuan.

As for glutinous rice and glutinous tea, none were opened.

### Vermicelli Fluctuation

The current vermicelli market is fluctuating. As rice prices continue to fall and the arrival of Dingfen in Shanghai is constant, it is difficult to boost morale. However, stockpilers in the industry absorb whenever prices are low, and Nanyang buyers also take advantage of cheap purchases. Therefore, the market stops falling when it wants to fall. Today, 200 bags of Australia vermicelli of the Flower Bird brand were traded at 31.25 yuan, American vermicelli of the Fortress brand at 30.08-9 yuan, and Kan vermicelli of the Golden Dragon brand at 30.05-07 yuan.

The future of the market is also in a state of fluctuation.

The purchase of goods by Japanese factories at the market has also become scarce. It is said that the current market price of Gaodu wheat is 45-46 yuan, a slight decrease of 1-2 yuan compared to before, but there is no formal opening.

Smiling all the way and crying all the way is the usual sight in the market. Now, the bulls are losing, and the bears are thriving. Yesterday, the price of corn fell first and then collapsed, but its potential is still weak and unable to recover. As a result, it continued to fall by 1.4-5 yuan. It is estimated that more than 2,000 bags of spot goods were traded, and 50 tons of futures. The opening price for Saigon old goods was 27.5 yuan to 28 yuan, and the price for new goods was 29.5 yuan to 30 yuan.

### Conflicting News, Gold Market Speculation

Lost and Confused

The black market for raw gold yesterday initially rose and then suddenly turned lower. People from all sides were extremely uncertain. The reason was that domestic and international news and rumors were conflicting, and it was impossible to determine which were bullish and which were bearish. At the morning opening, it continued the upward trend after the previous day's close, and with the US dollar softening to 5.3125 yuan, it opened at 6,500 yuan, the high price for the day. When Xinyuan and Chengji sold off, buying interest dissipated, and a reverse trend began. Furthermore, the rumor of a Sino-British-American military alliance caused foreign exchange to return from tight to flat. Tong Kangyong repeatedly sold off, and the price continued to fall. In the afternoon, the story of the devaluation of the US dollar rose, so in the midst of selling, it retreated to 6,443 yuan.

Raw Gold Rose Very Slightly

Since the June contract (10 taels per bar) in the morning, the mood had been upward after the close in the afternoon of the previous day, and the US dollar was also tightening, so the price was raised. The market opened at 9:15 at 6,500 yuan, which was 54 yuan higher than the closing price in the afternoon of the previous day. Xinyuan, Tong Kangyong, Chengji, Hengji, Xinfeng, and Yongli sold, initially pressing it down to 6,472 yuan. Securities firm Defu bought, raising it to 6,487 yuan. Then, rumors of negative news were heard, and Xinfengyong, Tianyuan, Chengji, Dafeng, Tong Kangyong and Yongli sold, retreating to 6,450 yuan.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Rose in the Afternoon

The gray market for public bonds saw a downward trend in the morning, but there were also those who pushed it up in the afternoon, and it rebounded and rose. It was seen that the bulls made repeated efforts, and a part of the bulls were able to release it at a good price. This kind of abnormal development is not the right path. Because in recent days, there have been general operators in the market who tend to raise prices whenever they fall. However, they can often arouse the optimism of a part of the people, so the market price rises slightly, and someone raises it. The future changes will occur in this ruthless price increase. Yesterday morning, Lianhe and Tongkang bought, and Lianyi and Hengyi sold, and the market price fell by 2-3 jiao. The noon closing also recovered slightly. In the afternoon, Lianhe came again to raise the price. Hongda also had a need, and type C instantly reached 6 yuan, and it entered and exited at the 6 yuan level several times, and was finally held up, and closed at 6 yuan outside.

### Yarn and Cloth: Bullish Chips Closed, Yarn Market Rebounds, Double Horse Near the 500 Yuan Mark

The yarn market continued to improve. This was because generally financially affluent households were coming to purchase a batch at the Daanfeng, and by pulling with high prices, they would not suffer losses. At the same time, a portion of the chips were absorbed by the bulls, closed, and not released. Therefore, the number of transactions on the market was very strong, and short-sellers could not paste the interest rate. Therefore, everyone said that there was a lack of warehouse orders, and it took until 8 or 9 o'clock every day to ease the warehouse orders. From this point of view, it is beneficial to the bulls. In addition, the foreign American and Indian cotton markets all soared, which is also a benefit for the price increase, so the buyers' intentions were particularly strong, and the bullish mentality was strong again. However, some people say that American cotton is rising, foreign exchange is playing a long game, and margins are downward. If the price goes over 500 yuan, it is okay to sell. The high price of 20-count Varma cotton was 1,494 yuan, and the low price was 1,482 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,494 yuan, and it rose to 1,499 yuan. Then, as the price of gold fell, it fell to 1,486 yuan, but morale was still good, and finally returned to 1,494 yuan, it was said. Today, 1,145 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning due to the improved morale in the afternoon of the previous day, and the price rebounded. The bulls did not lose money, so the buying momentum in the market was strong. The first board price was 1,485 yuan, and it soon rose to 1,494 yuan. At this time, roughly retail investors were buying empty, and then it was heard that the margins were flat and the foreign exchange was not moving, so it returned to 1,484 yuan. However, the tabletop already belonged to the bullish position, and morale was firm and high. Most people were optimistic, and as Indian cotton jumped greatly, the buying momentum was outstanding, rising again to 1,494 yuan. The closing price was 1,492 yuan. The turnover for the half day was approximately 10,705 bales, of which fellow traders accounted for 10,000 bales, and Hong Kong 705 bales.

### American and Indian Cotton Soar Again and Again, Morale in the Cotton Market is Bullish

The current cotton situation is trending well with foreign cotton. The morale of fellow traders is mostly bullish because the American and Indian cotton markets are rising across the board. However, factory owners are unwilling to make large purchases at this time, and numbers houses are also unwilling to boldly move in, making it difficult to achieve smooth transactions. It is learned that the Shenxin Factory has been purchasing a lot of fire machine cotton raw materials recently because of the strong sales of coarse yarn.

Middling 425.5 No. 125 pieces were delivered to the warehouse.

Again, 425 Again, 100 pieces were delivered to the warehouse.

Again, Ordinary 416 Again, 100 pieces were delivered to the warehouse.

Although the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai was not much, the consistent bullish sentiment was driven by the turning of the yarn market and soaring prices of American and Indian cotton. Simultaneously, most merchants holding stock did not want to sell readily.

The New York cotton market initially rose due to massive public consumption and Washington political news of the Senate agreeing to an 85% loan, but then slightly declined due to some profit-taking. As a result, the closing price was 13-14 points higher than the previous day.

Also, Washington Electricity, the Bureau of Statistics, published the April U.S. cotton industry statistics left, (clothing unit thousand bales, spindle unit thousand pieces)

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to retail liquidation and rebounded because of active short covering. Then, due to continuous purchases by buyers and scarce inventories, the market suddenly soared. As a result, the closing prices, apart from white Roche, rose by 38 rupees uniquely in April-May, and the rest rose by 10 rupees or more.

It is also predicted that today's opening market will look low at 5.75 rupees.

### Sugar Market: The Decline of Coarse White is Even Worse

Yesterday's sugar market saw a further sharp decline due to the continuous decline in recent days, and people's nervousness was even more severe. Therefore, the market price fluctuated throughout the day, and the ups and downs were also as much as 3.4-5 yuan. The association's disc prices, spot 24 coarse white outer warehouse was 106.2 yuan, a drop of 5.3 yuan compared to the previous (13th). The initial price of coarse white for the May 20th period was 108.4 jiao, 7 jiao, 5 jiao, to 8 yuan, and then turned to decline to 107.6 jiao, 3 jiao, 5.6 jiao, and recovered to 6.9 jiao in the middle, suddenly down to 5 yuan, and then closed at 5.9 jiao and 6 yuan, a drop of 4.4 jiao. The May end period also opened at 109 yuan, which was initially good at 9.2 jiao, 4 jiao, and up to 9 yuan, and then fell to 8.7 jiao, 8 yuan, 7 yuan, 6.7 jiao, 4 jiao, and 3 jiao, until 5.9 jiao and 7 jiao, and then rebounded slightly to 106.12 yuan, and even to 7.5 jiao, 4 jiao, 3.5 jiao, and 2.5 jiao, and 3 jiao, and closed at 7.3 jiao, a drop of around 3 yuan. Taikoo Cart White B mark was 110 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Difference Between Sales Prices of Coarse Cloth and Coarse Twill is More Than 7 Yuan

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was stable, but the actual demand was flat, and most speculators were also holding back. The sales prices of each cloth differed greatly due to the thickness of the inventory. For example, the cost of 16-pound coarse cloth and coarse twill was the same, but the current market price of coarse twill was (per piece) 7 yuan higher than that of coarse cloth. Moreover, it was also seen that lower-grade fine twill was in short supply, and only fine cloth was in surplus. Shenda Factory's 78-yard twill is now quoted at 77 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan compared to the previous day, with the remaining grades rising by 2 jiao and a half. Coarse cloth and coarse twill rose by 2 jiao and a half each due to the increase in the factory disc prices, while fine cloth declined instead, by 2 jiao and a half. Approximately 300 pieces of gray cloth were traded on this street, and the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs continued to handle approximately 200 pieces of coarse and fine twill and colored twill. Approximately 3,000 pieces of bleached and printed cloth were handled in Singapore. Today, there are 2,050 pieces of cloth heading to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: The opening price of the white goods leader fine cloth was 49.56 yuan, and then the selling prices gradually declined because the actual sales were not strong. The afternoon market price was 48.9 jiao. The price of colored goods, 4 Gentlemen flannel, was 1.5225 yuan.

### Hardware: Black Iron Billets Sales are Slow

The market for black iron billets remained sluggish yesterday. The number of sales from overseas merchants was sparse, and sales were limited to local can factories, iron printing factories, and machine factories. The number of transactions was not large, so the overall market was not lively. The morale among fellow traders was not strong due to the slow sales. The prices of the margin banks were also weak, such as 2,000-pound billets from the New Steel Factory were offered at 3,200 yuan per bundle, while goods from the Old Steel Factory were sold at 3,300 yuan per bundle, a drop of approximately 50 yuan each.

### Dried Goods: The First Batch of New Bamboo Shoots are on the Way

The season for the arrival of fresh green bamboo shoots is now upon us. It is heard that the first batch of Tianmu Tips has been shipped and is on the way, and should arrive in Shanghai soon. It is said that the current production price is extremely high, and even fresh bamboo shoot blanks require approximately 1 yuan per catty. If so, the high price of ten goods can be imagined.

Essays

### Hope

— Jue Hui

Everyone has hope, the only difference lies in the difference itself.

Hope also has degrees: intense is called fervent hope, urgent is called longing, and near impossible is called extravagant... The most "inauspicious" is naturally disappointment!

Hope also has a scope: treacherous merchants hope rumors will spread like bees, hoarders hope their price increases will be pasted high, and poor scholars hope to have ragged clothes to cover their bodies and thin porridge to fill their stomachs! It is indeed possible to obtain small grain rice from various sources, the more the better, and to distribute it evenly so that it is no longer subject to exploitation by treacherous merchants.

Originally, everything is upside down in the present state, and hope cannot be an exception; however, we will never despair, we still have heat.

Of course, the more extravagant the hope, the more likely it is to be "fulfilled." The lower the hope, the more likely it is to be disappointed, and even merely hoping to prolong the last breath is impossible. But our current "fervent hope" needs to be expanded.

What was hopeless before need not be extravagant now; what was disappointing before must not be allowed to be disappointing now!

### Confessions of a "Neuropathic Apprentice"

— Sun Jianbai

—"Teach these children"—

I've been idle for a long time, people looked down on me, and I felt uncomfortable myself. Since my uncle was kind enough to get me a job as an apprentice in a trading house, of course I had to thank him profusely. At least I could feed myself—that's what my parents thought, and that's what I thought too.

What kind of work was done in the trading house? What should an apprentice do? I didn't understand at all. I wanted to ask, but I couldn't find anyone to ask. There were people in the house, but those two guys were all arrogant and condescending! Just looking at them filled me with anger. If I didn't understand, I didn't understand, but I couldn't stand those two "straight faces"!

The days passed in a muddle. My job was to write on the blackboard and report market prices. Although I got thirty yuan a month, I always wanted to quit when I thought that I was helping those speculators who disrupted society and manipulated prices! Of course, I was just thinking about it; I was afraid of being idle!

I couldn't stay vague all the time, there had to be a chance for everyone to talk. One morning, I specially bought a pack of cigarettes and brought them to the trading house, hoping to break the ice by offering them a smoke.

I had just offered the cigarettes to the skinny-faced accountant surnamed Li when things went sour. That guy didn't take my cigarettes, nor did he say he didn't want them. He just laughed a few times, took out a pack of "Craven A" from his pocket, lit one, and started smoking, staring straight at the window.

I didn't say anything and turned to look at the other guy surnamed Han. That guy was also sneering contemptuously. I looked down at my blue cloth gown, although it had ten patched spots, my mother had washed it very cleanly, without any oil stains or ink marks; so why was he looking down on me like that? Was it because I wasn't a local? Was it because I was poor? Was it because...? What was it really for?

So I opened my mouth and said, "Mr. Li! My cigarettes are bad, but you shouldn't look down on people like this!"

"You're a student! You don't need to worry about how people treat you. Take the spittoon over there and empty it. There's no teaboy here, so that's your job! As for that lousy cigarette, smoke it yourself! But you're not allowed to smoke it here!" The skinny guy said, his eyes blazing, and the flesh on his face was all taut.

My temper flared up! The ease of making money in speculative business had fostered this guy's "luxury" and "arrogance." I couldn't forget that I had been a teacher and taught many children. I felt that I had to teach this skinny guy a lesson too. I reached out and slapped that "skinny face" so hard that it turned to the side, but I felt relieved in my heart.

The skinny guy was angered by the slap. Together with the guy surnamed Han, he rushed towards me, but didn't dare to lay a hand on me, just cursed loudly.

By the time the neighbors from the next room came to break us up, our two gowns were torn to shreds, and those two guys had been thoroughly beaten by me!

The boss fired me, saying that I had "neuropathic disorder." I ran home. I'd rather die than work for you!

People all said "neuropathic disorder" behind my back. When I thought about it, I felt strange too. The funniest thing was that the skinny guy never expected to be slapped by me the first time. He cursed me as a beast, a hooligan, a bandit. I ignored him completely. I just felt that I had done everything right. In this day and age, whoever bullies me gets beaten!

### Beggar Art

— Sima Jun

The art of beggars is rarely noticed, and even if some attention is paid to it, beggar art has "appreciable" aspects. But when they follow you around asking for money, it's truly disgusting.

Not all beggars are the same, so their "art" also varies.

Those who beg at the door, in addition to shouting "Boss," swallowing iron pellets, wearing chains, and balancing bowls, these are hard-to-hard arts. Watching him swallow an iron pellet the size of his mouth into his stomach and then thrust a sword into his throat is truly admirable. A chain can be threaded from the nostril to the mouth, and bamboo chopsticks can hold up a bowl. I think this is more magnificent than the art of the circus, because these genuine skills only ask for a few cents in reward, without relying on bragging or publicity.

As for the beggars on the road, they rely on their "three-inch tongue." Following people, they say "Young Master this, Mr. that, Old Master Wealthy," while calling out several times. Their art is to keep talking non-stop, like a string of rolling beads. When the weather is hot, they will fan you from behind with a palm-leaf fan, and sometimes they will shout, "Young Master, watch out for puddles."

However, some people think that the most "basic" thing is to write a petition, in which he writes a "resume," telling all his sufferings and begging "benevolent gentlemen to show their sympathy and bestow a few coins." However, these people want some "face," but in fact, people can see through his "insides."

Looking at the art of beggars above, those who beg at the door are "pragmatic," while those who write petitions, etc., if exposed, may be "worthless."

Campus Scene

### The Last Class

— Zhu Hu

"Oh, Little Wang, you're here so early."

"You're early too, Old Chen."

The clock clearly pointed to only five minutes before class time. Old Chen threw the book hard on the table, then turned around and took out three cigarettes from his pocket, handing one to Little Wang.

"Old Chen, I heard from Old Cao that you hoarded a lot of coal, didn't you?"

"I sold it all off a while ago. I was lucky. If I hadn't sold it off, I would have been at risk!" Old Chen replied with a smile.

"Yeah, I originally had a friend who wanted to hoard hardware with me, but we couldn't agree, so I didn't hoard it. Really, hardware once fell, but now it's back up." Little Wang flicked off the ashes.

A lot of students came to the classroom one after another. Tall Ah Gao pulled Old Chen as soon as he stepped into the classroom door and asked:

"Why isn't Old Yang here? Did he take leave?"

"No, today Miss Shen asked him to go see 'The Merry Cavalier,' and asked me to substitute for him." Old Chen replied.

"That's terrible. People are waiting for his reply on a hundred boxes of foreign candles, but he put it behind his head and is having a good time." Ah Gao was complaining angrily when he suddenly heard the sound of leather shoes. He jumped up happily and said, waving his hand, "Hello, Miss Yin, 5:30 movie tickets, I bought them, 'Heroes on the Sea' at the Grand Theater."

The woman brushed the stray hair behind her ear lightly.

Ah Gao still said with a sly smile:

"No matter if the movie is good or not, after watching it, we can go to the New Asia Restaurant for dinner, and then go to the MGM for a while, wouldn't that be nice?"

Before Miss Yin could nod, the well-dressed lecturer came in. After taking attendance, the students' voices became noisy again:

"Teacher, don't talk about books, talk about current affairs!"

"How should we observe the recent situation in US-Japan relations?"

"Why did Hess secretly leave Germany?"

"Don't talk about international affairs, talk about Shanghai!"

"Yes! Will the price of rice in Shanghai rise again? Which daily necessities will rise?"

The lecturer was speechless. He smiled, adjusted his tie, and began to talk about the recent developments in current affairs; from international affairs to Shanghai. The students listened quietly, occasionally exchanging a few words in private:

"I think we should hoard some daily necessities!"

"No, instead of hoarding, it's better to get some stocks!"

Ah Gao took out his gold-cased watch and saw that it was almost five o'clock. He stood up and winked at Miss Yin, who also stood up.

Class was over. As the lecturer was about to leave, he was surrounded by students outside the classroom again:

"Mr. ×, what goods are you hoarding? Can I buy a share?"

"I want to buy a share too, Mr. ×, are you free? Let's go together! It's my treat."

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(8) Palpable Friendship

Because of this, although Shao Wen spent a lot of time in the hospital consecutively, trying to comfort him with various words, Qiu Haitang still couldn't sleep without sleeping pills, and even when he did fall asleep, it was only for a short hour or two each time, which gradually led to his mental decline.

"Your family affairs, Miss Luo's affairs, and that scoundrel Ji Zhaoxiong's affairs, I can take care of them for you in one go!" On this day, Shao Wen, urged by both public and private matters, had to leave Tianjin with Yuan Baofan. Before leaving, he repeatedly exhorted Qiu Haitang, "It's useless for you to think about anything now, it only tortures your body in vain! What if I take care of everything for you, but you become seriously ill yourself? Wouldn't that be a waste of all my efforts? So, my good brother, please listen to me and rest in peace! After I return to Beijing, I will write to you at least every three days. I think I'll have good news for you before you even leave the hospital!"

Shao Wen spoke all the way, constantly giving him very sincere smiles, hoping to relieve some of his worries; but the deep sorrow in Qiu Haitang's heart was still as difficult to melt as a frozen block of ice.

In the following three days, he not only slept very little, but his appetite also decreased to the point where it was worse than that of a patient suffering from internal ailments. Although the medical expenses that Shao Wen had prepaid for him still had a lot left, the doctors couldn't help but start to worry; because no matter how unrelated doctors and patients were, curing a patient was certainly more pleasant than watching a patient die!

"The patient in room ten is in even worse condition today, he seems to be in a state of delirium, and he just vomited up the milk he drank," a female nurse hurriedly walked into the office, reporting to the three resident doctors. (107)

### New Contributions of "Cartoon" Creator Walt Disney

— Xin Juan

New Techniques Performed in "Fantasia"

The creation of cartoon films predates movies. The history of "cartoons" began in 1824 when the magic lantern was invented in Europe. The second step in the development of "cartoons" was to photograph them from drawings. In recent years, cartoon films have advanced to having sound and color, with many bizarre scenes and actions. Things that cannot be seen in ordinary films can be seen in cartoon films through the strokes of a pen, because every inch of a cartoon film is carefully drawn by hand, so it takes a long time to produce. The screening time of a cartoon film is usually from twenty to thirty minutes.

In the past, cartoon films were all short films, and "Mickey Mouse" was the best drawn among the short films, so Walt Disney, the creator of Mickey Mouse, became famous. He has extraordinary artistic talent and perseverance. He has been tirelessly engaged in the production of "cartoons", and his skills have become increasingly refined. Undoubtedly, he has now become the authoritative cartoon creator in the film industry.

Due to the popularity of cartoon films, under the efforts of Walt Disney, a full-length cartoon film was finally released. "Snow White" shocked the art world and swept audiences around the world. Because of its vivid and detailed drawings, this unprecedented full-length cartoon film broke box office records and was selected as one of the top ten films of the year before last.

Following "Snow White" came Fleischer's "Gulliver's Travels," but because the drawing and other techniques were not as good as Disney's, it failed to give audiences a good impression. Disney's work after "Snow White" was "Pinocchio," although this cartoon film was also successful, it was not as praised by the audience as "Snow White."

His third full-color cartoon feature film, titled "Fantasia," was originally scheduled to be completed before Christmas last year, but was delayed due to production issues and was only recently fully edited and premiered in Hollywood. In this cartoon film, Walt Disney not only exhausted all of his painting artistic talents, but also achieved great success in music. All the dragon surface movements and colors in the film are completely coordinated with the music. It contains Stokowski's adaptation of Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony" and Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring," and even more noteworthy is the visualization of Schubert's "Ave Maria." This new attempt has never been seen before.

After completing the cartoon film "Fantasia," Disney is currently starting to produce another new film, titled "The Reluctant Dragon." He contributed a new technique in the wooden film, which is to have real people and cartoon characters acting together. From this point alone, you can know the novelty of its content.

### Wang Xichun's Stomach Illness Relapses

— Bai Ding

"Princess Bi Luo" Work Suspended

Wang Xichun, this beautiful little bird, has been really popular in both the opera and film circles for three years. However, the life of an artist is not as beautiful as people imagine. The more famous one becomes, the more pain follows. Superficial pleasure cannot represent the inner feelings.

Just imagine: On the one hand, she has to perform Peking opera at the Carlton, and on the other hand, she often works under the mercury lamps at Hezhong. At the same time, the Venus Guolian authorities also want to invite her to guest star in one or two films. How can her weak body sustain such intense work on three fronts? Also, because her diet is unbalanced, she finally developed a stomach illness.

More than ten days ago, just as she was filming "Princess Bi Luo" at Hejia, her stomach illness suddenly broke out, causing her to vomit on the spot and almost faint. Later, she returned home, and the "Dragon and Phoenix Presenting Auspiciousness" that she was supposed to sing at the Carlton was also performed by someone else. She gradually recovered after resting for two days.

Recently, Yan Jupeng performed at the Carlton, which, in theory, should have given her a chance to rest. Unexpectedly, her stomach illness relapsed yesterday, and the condition was quite serious, so she had to lie in bed and ask a Western doctor for treatment. As for Hezhong's "Princess Bi Luo," it had to be suspended.

### News in Brief from the Entertainment World

More than a dozen filmmakers, including Zheng Xiaoqiu, Qin Wei, Chen Zhong, and Zhou Qi, attended the event.

Li Hong suddenly fell ill, and the new film "Where Does the Soul Return" had to be temporarily suspended.

### Summary of the Philosophy of Vigorous Action

— Zong Yu

The result of actions should absolutely not be for self-interest at the expense of the group. It should be beneficial to both the group and the individual. Sometimes the group and the individual cannot have both, one should sacrifice oneself and fulfill the interests of the group.

### Blood Rain Qiong Pa

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 9: Why Do You Pity Him Coming to the Ends of the Earth?

Xu Jing was wondering where the dart came from when he heard a shout from the ridge. A handsome young man came running down, wearing a Wusheng hat, a green silk robe, and quick boots. His face was like jade, his eyebrows were slender, and his cheeks were rosy, making him both handsome and heroic. Xu Jing couldn't help but stare blankly. The handsome young man also looked at Xu Jing for a while, and thought that Xu Jing was also a handsome young man, not an ordinary person, so he cupped his hands and said, "Where do you come from, guest? There are many jackals and wolves in these mountains, and they come out to devour people and animals even during the day. Just now, I came down from the ridge and happened to see you fighting fiercely with that beast. I was afraid that the beast would hurt you, so I wanted to draw my sword to help, but unfortunately I had no weapon in hand. Fortunately, I had a dart with me, so I fired a dart and fortunately killed that evil beast. Please forgive my recklessness." Xu Jing heard the young man speak politely, and couldn't help but admire him even more. Because the young man asked him where he came from, but he couldn't easily explain the reason, he had to say, "My name is Xu Jing, and I came here from Qi County, Henan, to visit relatives, but I didn't find them. I was wandering in the mountains when I suddenly encountered a jackal. Fortunately, you helped me righteously. How can I express my gratitude? You killed the fierce wolf with a dart, which can only be done by someone with extraordinary skills. Please tell me your name, so that I can write it down." The handsome young man smiled and said, "You praise me too much, Mr. Xu, I am ashamed. My name is Liu Yining. I was originally from Jiangnan since I was a child, but later I was displaced to the north. This time I came to Daizhou to visit relatives because my aunt and uncle live here in seclusion. But after I came, my uncle suddenly fell ill and passed away, and my aunt wouldn't let me leave for a while, so I stayed here. When I have nothing to do, I often go to the mountains for a walk. It is a great coincidence that we met by chance. Since you came to visit relatives and didn't find them, why not stay at my aunt's house for a while, until you find out where your relatives have gone, and then make plans." Xu Jing listened, and it was exactly what he wanted, so he put the sword into its sheath, cupped his hands to the young man, and said, "Brother Liu, we have only met for the first time, but you have already shown me such kindness. I am suffering from having no place to eat or sleep. I am very grateful for your kindness and invitation. Is your aunt's residence in this mountain?" Liu Yining nodded and said, "Yes, this mountain is called Weifeng Mountain, and this ridge is called Phoenix Ridge. My aunt's house is on Phoenix Ridge, opposite Suoyi Ridge, which you just passed. Please come with me, Mr. Xu." (64)
