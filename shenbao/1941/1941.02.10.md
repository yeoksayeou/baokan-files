London - The Admiralty has just released a communiqué stating that the British Mediterranean Fleet launched an attack on the Italian port of Genoa this morning and is currently subjecting it to intense bombardment. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 9th)

London - The British Navy has begun attacking Genoa, Italy's largest naval base. According to a Navy communiqué, British warships, both light and heavy, launched a fierce bombardment of Genoa at dawn this morning. Although detailed information is still unclear, initial reports indicate that the bombardment was very successful. Genoa is Italy's fourth-largest city, a major port, and an important shipbuilding center, with a population of 650,000. It is located in the northwest of the Ligurian Sea, less than 100 miles from the French Riviera. Although this is the first time the British military has bombarded it from the sea, the docks and factories in the area have already been bombed four times by British aircraft during this war. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Cairo - According to a communiqué issued today by Middle East Command, British forces in Libya continue to make significant progress. El Agheila, about 140 miles south of Benghazi, has been occupied by the British armored column's motorized units. At the same time, the work of clearing the battlefield south of Benghazi is continuing. In addition to the one general and one division commander captured with great difficulty previously, five more senior generals and dozens of soldiers have been captured. The exact number of captured spoils is difficult to ascertain immediately. Although the enemy has sent reinforcements to the Eritrean front, the British forces near Keren are still making smooth progress in their operations. Furthermore, according to the British Air Force Middle East Headquarters, British aircraft destroyed eight Italian aircraft on the ground in the Alomata area of Abyssinia. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

London - According to General Wavell's communiqué issued yesterday, the Italian division commander captured in Benghazi is General Baccari. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

London - A special correspondent for Reuters cabled from the British military remembrance department stating that one Italian corps commander and the deputy commander of the Libyan army, whose position is second only to Commander-in-Chief Graziani, were captured in Benghazi. British armored units have cut off the retreat of the Italian forces in Benghazi, have now reached the coast, and are engaged in clearing operations. Thousands have been captured, and more prisoners are still being escorted back. To consolidate their position, the British armored units are now advancing towards Sirte, which marks the beginning of the 300-mile desert between Cyrenaica and Tripoli. It is said that at the beginning of the Libyan campaign, the Italian army had a total of fifteen divisions in the field, but now ten divisions have been lost, and the remaining five divisions have been demoralized due to the loss of various war equipment such as tanks and artillery, and are no longer capable of fighting. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Cairo - A communiqué from the British military remembrance department stated that British military operations south of Benghazi are progressing smoothly. British forces are also making progress on other African fronts. British forces within Eritrea are continuing to apply pressure and pursue the Italian forces, and the British mobile units in Abyssinia are also advancing along the main road to Gondar. At the same time, British reconnaissance units continue to advance into Italian Somaliland. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Vichy - After the Italian army withdrew from the port of Benghazi in Libya, military observers here commented on the African campaign, saying that of the fifteen Italian divisions in Libya, ten have been routed, and the Italian army has suffered heavy losses in military equipment. As for the British strategy of capturing the port of Benghazi for the second time, it is essentially the same as when they captured Sidi Barrani and Sollum last month. In other words, the British motorized units used flanking attacks with the advantage of wind and water, and because their advance was rapid, the Italian army was caught off guard, and their left flank defense collapsed immediately.

According to the latest news, British motorized units are now rapidly advancing along the coast of Sirte towards the no-man's land that stretches between Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. The area is 250 miles long. Except for a few isolated Italian outposts that are still resisting, almost all of it has fallen into British hands. Cyrenaica has a better climate than the surrounding desert areas, and has more water, making it easier to cultivate. Foreign colonists have settled here. The Italian government, in order to develop the area, selected 25,000 immigrants from the poor provinces of Italy and sent them here to engage in reclamation. Until 1934, Cyrenaica was merged with the Tripolitania region to become what is now Italian Libya. When the Italian colonists arrived here, they cut down shrubs and frankincense trees and planted olive trees, grapevines, fruit trees, and wheat, and the local economy gradually improved. By last year, the population had increased to one million, with Europeans accounting for 70,000, most of whom were Italians. The port of Benghazi has been developed into a modern port with a population of 35,000, and the port of Derna also has a population of 10,000. Both are centers of Italy's colonial policy in Libya.

### Italian Army Counterattack in Albania Meets with Disaster; Greek Artillery Fire Fierce; Remnants Piled Up in Mountain Areas

Athens - Local radio reported that on Friday, the Italian army counterattacked and broke through a Greek regiment at a certain point in the Klisura Pass, but the Greek army immediately responded with artillery support, and finally defeated the Italian army. The Italian army suffered heavy casualties in this battle, one of the most disastrous defeats of the Italian counterattack. As they retreated, corpses littered the ground, all killed by Greek artillery fire. Seeing the enemy formation in disarray, the Greek army launched an attack down the steep mountain passes and narrow valleys, capturing many enemies, including several officers. The Greek army's advance is quite satisfactory and has approached its target location. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Southern Capital Nanjing - According to Haitong News Agency correspondent Coste, the weather on the Albanian front has improved, and the air force is very active.

British long-range artillery has reached the Korçë area to assist in the fighting. (Haitong dispatch, 9th)

Athens - In the first three months of the Italian-Greek war, three Italian submarines and over 35,000 tons of transport ships have been sunk by the Greek side. According to a statement issued by the Greek Navy, among the Italian ships sunk was an auxiliary warship with two large cannons. The Italian claims that they inflicted heavy damage on the Greek Navy are completely untrue. All Greek destroyers are unscathed, and Greek merchant ships in the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas have not been damaged in any way by enemy actions or any other reasons. None have been hit; the victims are only women and children. The Italian attacks on the Albanian coast occupied by the Greek side have had no effect. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### Bulgaria to Join the Axis; Britain Issues Serious Warning; Bulgaria's Allowing Germany to Pass Through to Invade Greece Will Inevitably Lead to Unfortunate Consequences; Greek Army Concentrates on Bulgarian Border as a Precautionary Measure

Sofia - An official announcement stated that Britain has clearly warned Bulgaria that if a single German soldier enters Bulgarian territory, all Bulgarian transportation lines will be immediately bombed. London officials declined to confirm or deny a message from Sofia stating that Britain has warned Bulgaria that if German troops invade Bulgaria, the country's transportation lines will be bombed by the British Air Force. However, reliable sources believe that recent exchanges of views between British and Bulgarian diplomatic circles have indicated the unfortunate consequences of a German invasion of Bulgaria. (United Press dispatch, 9th)

Budapest - The situation in the Balkans has become even more tense. At the time, the "Deutsche Zeitung" declared that Bulgaria would follow in the footsteps of Hungary and Romania and join the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. This prediction has caused general concern that Germany may take action in Southeastern Europe to counter Britain's conquest of the Libyan Cyrenaica coast and Greece's invasion of Albania. The "Deutsche Zeitung" also warned Turkey in stern terms and hinted at the possibility of Turkey assisting Italy in attacking Greece. The above country is "now the last bastion of British interests in the Balkans." (International News Agency dispatch, 9th)

Budapest - According to news received here today, Greece suddenly concentrated a large army on the northeastern part of the Thracian border at dawn today, facing off against a large Bulgarian contingent of reinforcements. Since the "Deutsche Zeitung" in Budapest predicted that Bulgaria would soon join the Axis powers and would allow Germany to pass through to invade Greece, the situation in the Balkans has become more tense this morning. Currently, people in the Balkans are generally afraid that German leader Hitler will transfer troops to Southeastern Europe to counter the gains of the British army in Libya.

Editorial

### Prospects for Japan's Southern Advance

Japan's declaration of its intention to implement a "southern advance" has been nearly a year since Arita's statement on the Dutch East Indies last April. Looking at its evolutionary process, Japan failed to take swift action when Britain and France were defeated and the democratic camp was in disarray, which was indeed a lost opportunity. However, in the past six or seven months, it has been diligently managing, intensifying preparations, actually gaining some benefits, and also achieving a favorable strategic position in South Asia. Therefore, the situation in the South Pacific today is no longer comparable to what it was a year ago. At a time when the Nazi large-scale offensive against Britain is becoming increasingly urgent, the future prospects in this area are indeed a problem worthy of attention.

The so-called southern advance has already begun in fact. The coercion of French Indochina, the negotiations with the Dutch East Indies, and even the war and mediation between Thailand and Indochina, although different in form, can all be regarded as the actual actions of Japan's southern advance. Therefore, the question now is not when to advance south, but how to continue to advance south, whether to use trickery and plunder, or to actually take military action. As far as Japan is concerned, as long as it obtains real benefits, it does not care about the method. As for the objective impact, based on some past experience, the former will only stimulate the world's perception and may not immediately cause a major reaction. However, if it takes the latter path, it will inevitably lead to great turmoil. Look at the South China Sea and the South Pacific at this moment. Malaya and the Dutch East Indies are already on high alert. Even in Australia and the United States, are they not in serious alert? If the Japanese military is really preparing to take this step in the near future, then the prediction that a crisis will break out in the Far East in March or April will unfortunately come true, and the great war in the Pacific will ultimately be unavoidable.

However, the complexity of the situation in the Far East today far exceeds that of any era in history. The reason why Japan has spared no effort in roundabout operations and has not taken decisive action from last summer to the present is due to these complex factors. Since the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, the Axis powers have always hoped that a new storm in the Far East could break out before the European front, and Japan has also hoped that the Nazi offensive could restrain Britain and the United States' attention to the Far East. The so-called Far East crisis in March and April is also based on the premise of the German offensive against Britain. However, the Nazi offensive is only one of several factors that can influence the future destiny of the Far East, and only if the future European war relives the miracle of May and June last year will it have a decisive effect on the situation in the South Pacific. If that offensive cannot be achieved quickly, or if it makes progress but is not enough to fundamentally reverse the Axis powers' decline in recent months, then it will be difficult for it to exert a significant mutually reinforcing effect on Japan's southern advance. Recent Japanese arguments have expressed extreme anxiety about the Sino-Japanese War and diplomacy with the Soviet Union, precisely because these issues have a greater determining effect on the southern advance. Although Japan's strategic position in the South China Sea is far stronger than before, it has not improved its situation in the entire Pacific where it will be surrounded and opposed on all sides due to excessive adventure. This is a weakness and a fatal wound. Furthermore, looking at Japan's strategic position in the South China Sea, from Taiwan to the southern tip of the Indochina Peninsula, it has already arranged some advanced springboards, but it is more than enough for opportunistic raids, but insufficient for large-scale naval battles or the implementation of major strategic tasks. Because there are only some air stations and naval anchorages, but there is a lack of fully equipped naval and land bases for long-distance overseas operations. The above are the main reasons why the Japanese authorities are actively engaged in military preparations for the southern advance, while also not giving up various economic negotiations and various diplomatic maneuvers.

People often only focus on the danger of large-scale military actions in Japan's southern advance, while ignoring the various crises in the economic and diplomatic aspects. Although this crisis is still in the process of quantitative progression, if it is left unattended, it will inevitably form a qualitative change one day. For example, the ping-pong war between Thailand and Indochina has progressed from the start of the war to the ceasefire to the start of negotiations, and these steps have almost all been directed by Japan. Its future prospects are also predictable. If, as rumored, Japan will continue to gain some military advantages within Thailand and Indochina, then it will not be difficult to integrate the Sino-Japanese War on the southern battlefield in China with the southern advance, and it can also avoid the difficulties of the navy venturing far across the ocean to attack strongholds by taking the route through Vietnam and Thailand to spy on Burma and Malaya. However, this issue has not yet attracted the full attention of democratic countries, which cannot be regarded as a major regret. If the situation in Europe does not undergo major and extraordinary changes, then Japan, despite making all the threatening gestures in the military, will continue its past gradual policy in actual actions, satisfying its southern advance desires by means that do not excessively stimulate the world. This can be asserted at this moment.

### Nomura's Mission to the United States Doomed to Fail: Observations from the American Press

Washington: Simms, the international editor of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, wrote yesterday that the appointment of Nomura as the new Japanese ambassador to the United States can be divided into diplomatic and military aspects. Simms stated that the most important aspect is the military one. "As for the diplomatic appointment, it has long been known that it will ultimately fail. However, Nomura's report to Tokyo on whether the United States is prepared for war will determine Japan's actions in the Far East." Simms further stated that to improve friendship between Japan and the United States, the United States must be consistent in its actions towards Japan in the Far East. Simms concluded, "However, it can be asserted now that the United States has no intention of accommodating Japan." (United Press, 9th)

They often sacrifice significant interests for this, preferring to lose business rather than trade directly or indirectly with the enemy. (Reuters, 9th)

### Laval Refuses to Join Cabinet; The Political Situation in Vichy Is Fraught with Crisis; Laval's Demand for the Premiership Is Not Granted; Darlan Is Likely to Be Entrusted with Forming a New Cabinet

Vichy: According to an official announcement made at 8:00 PM yesterday, Marshal Pétain, the French Premier, will maintain his "Montoire policy" (discussions of French-German collaboration originated there) and invited Laval to join the government as a State Councillor, also proposing to appoint Laval as one of the supervisors, but Laval has refused Pétain's proposal. Minister of the Navy Darlan brought Laval's reply from Paris, stating that Laval refused to join a cabinet with Darlan as Premier and serve as one of the top three or four figures. Laval reiterated that he must obtain the premiership and that all cabinet members should be chosen by him, otherwise he would not join the cabinet. (United Press, 9th)

[Images of] Pétain (left) and Laval (right)

Vichy: This morning, newspapers here carried official reports regarding Minister of the Navy Darlan's talks in Paris, briefly stating that French Head of State Marshal Pétain promoted the Monroe Doctrine and specially invited Laval to join the cabinet, offering him positions as a cabinet member and a member of the steering committee, but Laval refused. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

New York: A dispatch from Vichy states that, according to reliable sources, after Laval refused to join the cabinet without controlling all powers, Marshal Pétain decided to appoint Navy Chief Darlan as Premier. It is heard that Marshal Pétain has entrusted Darlan with forming a cabinet. Laval and Flandin are unlikely to join the cabinet. It is rumored that Flandin has resigned as Foreign Minister, but it is not yet known whether Pétain's cabinet has already resigned. (Reuters, 9th)

Vichy: Marshal Pétain offered Laval a position in the government, but Laval refused to accept it. According to the French official news agency, Marshal Pétain recently proposed that Laval join the government as a State Councillor to assist in governing the country. Pétain's proposal was based on the talks with Hitler, which emphasized strict adherence to the armistice agreement and cooperation with Germany. Therefore, Laval refused to accept this proposal. (Reuters, 9th) Official sources in Vichy revealed that Marshal Pétain asked Laval to rejoin the cabinet, but Laval refused. As a result, the German-French crisis reached its most serious stage last night, because Laval's position clearly did not allow him to obtain the power he desired. This announcement shocked Vichy, as this action implicitly indicated that Germany's attempt to make Laval the de facto leader of the French government had been completely rejected by Pétain's supporters. The difficult situation caused by Marshal Pétain's sudden dismissal of Laval on December 13 has no immediate prospect of resolution. According to government sources, Laval was dismissed from his position as Deputy Premier due to a power struggle with Marshal Pétain. It is claimed that Laval, under the current crisis, demanded to be appointed as Premier, with the power to choose cabinet members and to be responsible only to the National Consultative Council. It is also rumored that Laval requested to personally handle German-French relations. (International News Service, 9th)

Clermont-Ferrand, France: The French "Journal des Débats," currently published in the unoccupied zone, commented on General Weygand's agreement to hand over the port of Bizerte in French Tunisia to Germany, stating that Marshal Pétain's policy is to strictly implement the armistice agreement, and no one can say that this implementation is not completely faithful. (Reuters, 9th)

Rumors of Pétain and Darlan Fleeing Prove Unfounded

Vichy: Regarding the rumors circulating from the Swiss capital that a coup had occurred in Vichy and that Pétain and Darlan had fled to Africa, officials here consider them absurd and not worthy of discussion. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

London: The German official news agency claimed, according to reliable neutral sources in Bern, that a revolution had occurred in Vichy and that Marshal Pétain and Darlan had both fled to Africa. London has not yet received confirmation of the above news. The German news agency indicated that this news came from neutral sources and did not take responsibility for it. This is a common trick of the German side to spread alarming news. The British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast to the French population within France in French last night, urging them to remain calm and not give the German side an excuse for further aggression, and stated that the above unconfirmed news was released by the German side to create disturbances to benefit the German side. (Reuters, 9th)

New York: Correspondents from both American broadcasting companies stationed in Vichy denied the rumors spread by the German side that disturbances had occurred in Vichy, saying that everything there was peaceful as usual. According to a correspondent from the National Broadcasting Company stationed in Vichy, someone met with Pétain in Vichy on Saturday and Sunday, and said that the resignation of Foreign Minister Flandin could only be accepted after a full cabinet meeting. According to a correspondent from the Columbia Broadcasting Company, Interior Minister Peyrouton seems likely to be sent to North Africa to serve as Civil Governor of Algiers to assist Weygand. (Reuters, 9th)

It Is Said That French General Weygand Will Meet With Wavell

Hungary: It is widely rumored here today that General Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces in Africa, and Lieutenant General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, will soon meet on a battleship somewhere in the Mediterranean. It is heard that American military observer and special envoy of President Roosevelt, Donovan, recently visited Weygand and Wavell and proposed this idea. Donovan is now in Jerusalem, having flown there from Istanbul. (International News Service, 9th)

Cabinet Held a Meeting to Hear Darlan's Report

Vichy: After returning to this place from Paris this morning, Navy Minister Lieutenant General Darlan immediately visited Head of State Pétain to report on his trip. The Cabinet then held a small meeting in the afternoon, attended only by Head of State Pétain, General Huntziger, and Foreign Minister Flandin to listen to the report presented by Lieutenant General Darlan. Officials refused to release any information about the results of the Navy Minister's trip. However, the atmosphere here is completely different from when Lieutenant General Darlan left for Paris. According to reliable sources, a cabinet reshuffle is still possible, but the various rumors circulating outside cannot be confirmed. What can be asserted at this time is that any changes that would weaken the special powers of Head of State Pétain will not occur. Furthermore, Lieutenant General Darlan repeatedly went to Paris and did everything possible to support Head of State Pétain to maintain national unity. Therefore, it is expected that he will be given greater responsibility in the future. In addition, General Weygand, the French government's commissioner to various territories in Africa, recently made a statement recognizing that the port of Bizerte in French Tunisia will be ceded to Germany. The significance of this action and the intentions of the French government can also be understood.

Germany to Gain Territory in Africa; Focus of Talks in Paris

Vichy: Regarding the French political situation over the past week, observers in political circles here stated that, initially, the newspapers in Paris unanimously and fiercely criticized the Vichy government, but did not dare to make irresponsible criticisms against Head of State Pétain personally. Later, a "National Unity Party" was first established here, and the so-called "Popular Unity Party" was also established in Paris, forming a remote confrontation. The work of Head of State Pétain inevitably encountered major difficulties. Navy Minister Lieutenant General Darlan then went to Paris on the 3rd of this month to meet with former Cabinet Secretary Laval, and returned to Vichy on the 5th. The atmosphere at that time was extremely tense. The Cabinet held a State Council meeting on that day, and the discussions lasted for two hours. The next day, Lieutenant General Darlan was ordered to go to Paris for a second time, and returned this morning, immediately attending a small cabinet meeting to report on his trip. The government has not released any official announcements regarding this matter, so rumors have arisen, but the authorities have denied them one by one. At the same time, General Weygand, the French government's commissioner to various territories in Africa, also made a statement acknowledging that the port of Bizerte in French Tunisia will be ceded to Germany. However, according to what some people here know, the talks between Vichy and Paris seem to focus on this issue. However, the atmosphere here has slightly eased today, but it has not been confirmed that various government departments will move back to Paris to work. (Havas, 8th)

### Germany Will Be Forced to Launch a Large-Scale Invasion of Britain; Britain Has Been Fully Prepared

London: General Dill, the Chief of Staff of the British Army, inspected the Canadian Second Division somewhere in Britain yesterday and told them, "I believe Germany will be forced to attempt an invasion of Britain. We have achieved an amazing and important victory in Libya, but the defense of the British Isles is crucial. If Germany attacks us, I believe you should be able to deal with it." Amery, the Secretary of State for India, also said in a speech in London yesterday that Hitler is in a difficult situation and will have to take action to invade Britain sooner or later. Therefore, it is expected that Germany's large-scale action will be launched soon. The Nazis are like tigers crouching in the forest waiting for the opportunity to pounce, but their ferocity has decreased compared to the past, because they have swallowed indigestible objects, causing their weight to become inflexible. Hitler has been waiting for the time to leap out for months, and the longer he waits, the less opportunity he has to show off his skills. (Reuters, 9th)

### US Aid to Democratic Nations Bill Passes House of Representatives and Is Handed Over to the Senate; Willkie, Who Returned from Investigating England, Will Go to the Senate to Defend the Government

Washington: The House of Representatives yesterday approved the "Aid to Democratic Nations Bill" (i.e., the Lend-Lease Act) as desired by the government, and passed the bill to the Senate by a vote of 260 to 165. The only amendment that was passed against the government's wishes was that both houses of Congress could abolish the powers obtained by the President under the Act at any time with the consent of the majority. Another important change was a government amendment stipulating that the value of military supplies, whether finished or contracted, shipped to foreign countries by the President shall not exceed $1,300,000,000. This amendment only applies to current bonds and contracts signed by the military based on the defense budget. Without special permission from Congress, military personnel may not be sent to areas outside the Western Hemisphere. (8) The opinion of New York Republican Representative Fish to render the Act useless by abolishing the power to execute the Act was rejected by a vote of 163 to 0. (9) Fish's amendment to prevent US military ports from being used to repair British ships was rejected by a vote of 147 to 70. (10) The suggestion that the Act be returned to the Foreign Affairs Committee for discussion was rejected. (11) The amendment by Maryland Democratic Representative Kennedy to postpone the implementation of the Act until the Secretary of State Hull proved to Congress that he was dissatisfied with the negotiated peace 30 days later was rejected. (12) The amendment by New York American Labor Party Representative Marcantonio, stating "If the Act includes a guarantee of full compensation, why do we offer it in the form of a lease bill? If we want to tell Britain that we will use tanks to support them, then we should let Britain know as soon as possible. If we will not use tanks to support them, then we should let Britain know as soon as possible. What we need is just a simple budget," was rejected by a vote of 180 to 2. Landon asked again, "Does Congress also suggest concentrating the power to allocate all the resources of our country in one person until China drives the Japanese out of the country and until China drives the Communists out?

### International Anecdotes (4): Pétain, Old but Vigorous

Old General Pétain is in such a situation, having to appease the country on the one hand and deal with strong neighbors on the other, truly suffering from difficulties on all sides. Now, the London Picture Post's biography of Pétain is translated below:

Marshal Pétain, the head of the Vichy government in France, is already an 84-year-old hero who established outstanding achievements in the last World War and became immortal. According to a group of military historians and authoritative commentators, the reason why Foch, the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the last World War, was able to achieve the final victory was entirely due to General Pétain laying the initial foundation for him. If it were not for Pétain's preparations in 1917 and 1918, this final victory might not have been so certain! His great achievements in defending Verdun bravely in 1916 are praised by the world and are never excessive.

Looking at Pétain's life, he has been tricked by fate twice. When the last World War broke out, Pétain was already 58 years old. He was an obscure infantry officer who had always lived a plain and unremarkable life, sometimes living in Paris and sometimes in the provinces. From 1901, he served as a professor of infantry at the Senior Military Academy. When he was promoted to colonel, he was almost at retirement age. If there had been no earth-shattering event in July 1914, his life would have been submerged in obscurity, and who would know this famous old hero today!

After the outbreak of the last World War, Pétain suddenly emerged. He participated in the operations of the Fifth Army in Belgium from the beginning. In September 1914, he was promoted to lieutenant general, and from then on, he rose rapidly, first commanding a division, then commanding an army (the famous 33rd Army). From 1914 to the winter of 1915, he made outstanding contributions in the Battle of Artois. Finally, he was transferred to command the Second Army Corps and participated in the Battle of Champagne on September 25, 1915. In the report he made after the war, he earned the title of a strategist and tactician who completely disregarded conventions.

His new military principles had a great impact. However, the supreme glory he gained was in the defense of Verdun, from February 1916 to May. The slogan "They shall not pass" has become an immortal saying since then. Many French soldiers who participated in the Battle of Verdun can testify that this commander-in-chief was very heroic and very kind. He had a tall stature and blue eyes. He treated soldiers like a loving father on weekdays. He not only knew how to command and how to deploy defenses, but also knew how to maintain and how to encourage. He often stood on the lower level of the stone steps in front of the headquarters of Souilly, eagerly inspecting the army, tirelessly for hours. When the soldiers jumped off the vehicles, they asked each other, "Have you seen Pétain?"

After May 1916, he commanded the Central Army in Verdun and continued to direct the battle. On May 15, 1917, he succeeded General Nivelle and was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the French Army. His task at that time was very difficult. The French army suffered heavy casualties due to Nivelle's poor command, resulting in depleted military strength and declining morale, bordering on collapse and mutiny. Pétain's mission was to restore morale, clarify discipline, and reorganize the military.

His actions were quite peculiar. He was originally a pessimist, always holding pessimistic thoughts, but looking around France, only he could give hope to the soldiers and reignite their courage to fight.

He had a deep understanding of soldiers, so even though the task was difficult, he was able to handle it with ease. He did not enforce the law too strictly, but focused on improving the lives of soldiers, and fought several small battles in a row to restore their self-confidence. He not only went to the front lines to inspect the army and had cordial conversations with officers and soldiers, but also called out a few people from the soldiers, asking them who was the bravest, and attached the badge to this person to encourage the morale of the army. By 1918, the morale of the French army was restored, and they first bravely defended, then switched to offensive, and under the guidance of Commander-in-Chief Foch, finally established a glorious armistice on October 11, 1918.

On November 19, Pétain was promoted to general and continued to serve in the army. In 1926, he quelled the Moroccan rebellion and revitalized France's military prestige in Africa. From 1922 to 1931, he served as the Inspector General of the French Army and Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Military Council, and in 1931, he was appointed as the Director General of Air Defense. (To be continued), The House of Representatives rejected the following points of the Lend-Lease Act yesterday: (1) By a vote of 122 to 38, the proposal by New York Republican Representative Walter Waters to limit the cost to $7,000,000,000 was rejected. (2) The proposal by New Jersey Republican Representative to limit the credit loan to Britain for purchasing US military equipment to $2,000,000,000 was rejected. (3) The amendment by California Democratic Representative Costello, stipulating that the total number of fighter planes given to foreign countries by the President shall not exceed one-half of the current total number of finished or contracted planes, was rejected. (4) By a vote of 132 to 82, the amendment by New York Republican Representative to prevent the rental or loan of military supplies except for sale was rejected. (5) By a vote of 127 to 71, the amendment by Massachusetts Republican Representative to only aid countries that "are willing to cooperate with the United States and dump American goods in peacetime" was rejected. (6) The amendment by Iowa Democratic Representative Harrington, stipulating that Britain must purchase a certain amount of pork, vegetable oil, cotton, and wheat from the United States every year, was rejected verbally. (7) The amendment by Pennsylvania Republican Representative to include the Philippine Islands and the Thirteen Colonies in the Act was rejected verbally. (13) By a vote of 137 to 82, the amendment by Montana Republican Representative Rankin, to prohibit the President from sending "any soldiers, sailors, marines, or pilots outside the Western Hemisphere" under the Act, was rejected. When Representative Rankin proposed this amendment, Texas Democratic Representative Puch asked, "Does this Act want to make the United States withdraw its fleet from Asia, and retreat if it doesn't work?" and then immediately withdrew his amendment. (United Press, 9th)

Washington: The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee resolved yesterday to extend the date for the committee to hear the Lend-Lease Act by one day for those who oppose the Act, because the opposition believes that the progress of the Act is too hasty. At the same time, the government hopes to invite Willkie, the Republican leader who went to England to investigate the war situation, to testify in the Senate in the near future to make a strong defense for the government. Landon, the defeated Republican presidential candidate in 1936, testified before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, denouncing the Act as "a speculative and bad policy" and demanding that Congress "control aid to Britain." Landon advocated giving billions of dollars in gifts to Britain. He claimed that if Britain's victory were in the United States' interest. After a short reception, the Dixie express plane carrying Willkie took off at 8:53 PM. When reporters asked about Willkie's future report on the Lend-Lease Act to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Willkie refused to answer. (International News Service, 9th)

### Improvements in China's Wartime Finance

— Introduction

A country that wishes to be among the world's strong nations must have a sound government to lead it. However, to have a sound government, there must first be sound finances as its backing. All government measures rely on ample financial resources, but the soundness of the financial system is also of great importance to us. Only a sound financial system can achieve ample financial resources. Conversely, if the financial system is unsound, even if the people bear a heavy burden, it will be difficult to achieve abundant revenue. Therefore, a sound financial system should refer to one that has a good financial system and can obtain ample financial resources. The reason why China was unable to establish a sound government after the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and before the establishment of the Nationalist Government was the lack of sound finances.

In times of peace, the importance of finance to the government is already such. In extraordinary times, its importance is far greater, as the soundness of finance is linked to the survival of the nation. Since the establishment of the Nationalist Government, China's finances have strived for reform until wartime, but there are still areas that have not been fully addressed. Although the accounting system has been established, a public treasury system has not yet been established. Moreover, China's national and local revenues and expenditures are not closely aligned with reality, placing counties in a subordinate position to provinces. With unsound county finances, all local construction is merely nominal. Furthermore, the tax system still places emphasis on the collection of indirect taxes, which is not in line with the latest financial principles.

The government, recognizing the importance of the financial position during wartime, aims to establish a sound wartime finance to achieve ultimate victory. Therefore, even during wartime, it continues to strive to reform the financial system, such as the establishment of the public treasury system, the improvement of local finances, and the collection of direct taxes. These will be described in detail below.

Establishment of the Public Treasury System

The Public Treasury Law was promulgated in June of the 27th year of the Republic (1938) and was implemented on a trial basis by central government agencies starting in November of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). From January 1st of this year (1940), except for Yunnan, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang, which are still under preparation, all local agencies across the country will implement it uniformly. (A) Significance and Importance of the Public Treasury System. China's financial administration adopts a joint organization, with the four powers of command, public treasury, accounting, and auditing separated. The command system is carried out by financial agencies, executing revenue and expenditure orders in financial administration. The public treasury system is managed by public treasury agencies, handling the receipt, disbursement, custody, transfer, and other financial matters of cash, notes, and securities. The accounting system is managed by accounting agencies, handling budget, accounting, and statistical affairs, with budget affairs referring to the preparation of budgets and final accounts. The auditing system is managed by auditing agencies, which conduct pre- and post-audits. Therefore, the so-called public treasury system is actually the receipt and disbursement of cash, notes, securities, and other financial assets of all government agencies, handled by an independent agency that specializes in these matters and manages them uniformly. Based on the principle of division of labor, it can achieve the effect of checks and balances. Its spirit comes from the "internal control" system in corporate accounting. The "internal control" system means that those who hold authority, manage assets, and manage accounts stand together, each performing their duties without encroaching on each other, so that those who manage assets and those who manage accounts can achieve the function of checks and balances to prevent fraud. As a result, the treasury's income increases, while the people's burden remains the same. It also makes the supervision of the accounting agency practical and facilitates the audit of the auditing agency. Therefore, the implementation of the public treasury system not only increases the strength of wartime finance but also lays the foundation for national construction finance after the war.

(B) Contents of the Public Treasury Law. The Public Treasury Law consists of thirty-two articles, and the implementing rules are forty articles. The main points are summarized below:

(1) Competent Authorities and Agents. The competent public treasury authority for the central government is the Ministry of Finance; for provincial governments, it is the Department of Finance; for municipal or county governments, it is the Finance Bureau; if there is no Finance Bureau, the respective municipal or county government is the competent authority. The public treasury of the central government is called the National Treasury; the public treasury of the provincial government is called the Provincial Treasury; the public treasury of the municipal government is called the Municipal Treasury; and the public treasury of the county government is called the County Treasury. The receipt, disbursement, transfer, custody of cash, notes, securities, and title deeds of properties at all levels should be handled by banks as agents. For the National Treasury, the Central Bank acts as the agent. For public treasuries at other levels, designated banks act as agents. In areas where there are no banks, postal agencies should be designated as agents.

(2) Handling of Revenue and Expenditure. All government revenue is collected by the agent agencies and deposited into the public treasury agent agency in the form of deposits. It is managed by the competent public treasury authority, and agencies are not allowed to keep it themselves. For payments, the accounting agency must first notify the competent public treasury authority based on the allocated budget. It is then notified by the competent auditing agency along with it to the public treasury agent agency, which can then be withdrawn from the total income deposit according to the agency category of the expenditure. However, if the government incurs unplanned expenditures, it may be paid by the competent public treasury authority by emergency order in accordance with the law, so that the public treasury can make timely payments without delaying important matters. However, a supplementary budget should still be made afterward. However, under the following circumstances, the silver and financial assets of government agencies may be kept by themselves:

(A) Exceptions to Revenue: The following types of revenue can be collected by themselves and kept by themselves within the prescribed period (not exceeding ten days): (a) Miscellaneous income – that is, each income is less than five yuan. (b) If the agency's location is beyond the prescribed distance from the public treasury agent agency, its income can also be kept by itself. (C) If the managing agency deems it appropriate to provide convenience for collection and payment at the collection location, its income can also be. (d) If the agency has no fixed location, its income is also the same. (B) Exceptions to Expenditure: The following types of expenditure may be drawn from the public treasury in advance for the prescribed period and kept and disbursed by themselves: (a) Monthly fixed petty cash can be drawn at the end of the previous month and disbursed by themselves. The amount is less than half of the office expenses. (b) If the agency's location is beyond the prescribed distance from the agent public treasury agency, its expenses can be claimed when actually needed. (c) If the agency has no fixed location, its expenses can also be claimed when needed. (d) Other estimated and contracted amounts permitted by laws and regulations should be claimed according to the contract or the time specified in laws and regulations, and supporting documents should be submitted for verification by the competent authority.

### Implementation of the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law and Reorganization of Local Finance

The current national and local revenue and expenditure standards in China are based on the National Revenue and Local Revenue Standards and the National Expenditure and Local Expenditure Standards of the 17th year of the Republic (1928). Among them, only two levels, national and local, are distinguished, but according to the actual political system, there must be at least three levels: central, provincial, and county. In this standard, all local taxes are provincial taxes, and county finance has no independent source of tax revenue, only existing as a subordinate to the province. Its income relies on surtaxes for support. However, in fact, the county is an autonomous unit, and all local construction depends on its promotion. Moreover, according to historical facts, the province only represents the central government's agency, and its task is only to convey the central government's will to the county. Therefore, the adjustment of tax sources between the province and the county is an important step in reorganizing local finance.

In July of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the National Government promulgated the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law. Except for cities directly under the Executive Yuan and provinces, it divides into three levels: central, provincial, and county. In terms of tax revenue, on the one hand, it adopts a tax sharing system to divide the revenues between the province and the central government and between the province and the county; at the same time, it grants powers so that the central government, province, and county each have independent expenditure items; it also adopts a subsidy system to regulate the surpluses and deficits between the central government, province, and county. Surcharges are prohibited to avoid excessive burdens on the people. However, the essence lies in reducing the province's financial power to enrich the county's financial resources, so as to establish a sound county finance. In March of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the National Government also promulgated the Regulations for the Implementation of the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law and stipulated that it would be implemented on January 1st of the 27th year of the Republic (1938). Due to the outbreak of national crisis, it was not implemented. However, the authorities, recognizing the importance of finance and that a sound county finance is the prelude to county autonomy and the first step in implementing constitutional government, ordered in January of this year (1940) that it be implemented from January 1st of next year (1941). The division of revenue between the central and local governments in various countries often varies due to historical background, economic, social, and political systems. However, the methods of the tax system can be broadly divided into an independent tax source system, an allocated tax amount system, and a surtax system. In the current Financial Revenue and Expenditure System, the independent tax source system and the allocated tax amount system are adopted simultaneously, while surtaxes are prohibited. The division is shown in the table above: It can be seen from the above that after the implementation of this law, land tax will be collected by the county, so the province's revenue will be greatly reduced, which is probably one of the reasons why this law has been slow to materialize. However, the stipulated tax rate for the province, from 15% to 45%, is very flexible. Because the rate used for the province can be determined according to the wealth or poverty of the county. A poor county needs to enrich its county finances so that it can develop local undertakings, so the rate used should be low. A wealthy county should use a high rate for the province so as to maintain its own financial resources.

The division of expenditures has the following standards: (1) The expenses required by the central government to exercise judicial, examination, and supervisory powers in the localities are borne by the central government. (2) National defense and foreign affairs expenses are borne by the central government. (3) The expenses for the relocation of people and overseas Chinese affairs are borne by the central government. However, provinces and cities with special connections to relocation or overseas Chinese affairs may also determine their own expenses. (4) The expenses for the people to exercise political power in the government areas at all levels are borne by the governments at the respective levels. (5) The total amount of education, culture, economic construction, health care, and relief expenses must be at least 30% of the total budget in the central government; in the province or city, it must be at least 60% of the total budget.

The purpose of subsidies is to develop impoverished areas and to revitalize their undertakings. Or to be used to control financial administration. The Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law stipulates two types: (1) Subsidies for revitalizing undertakings; if the upper-level government wants to promote the balanced development of education, culture, economic construction, health care, and relief undertakings in the area under its jurisdiction, it may grant subsidies to the lower-level government and may obtain assistance from other lower-level governments. Unless otherwise stipulated by law, their use is limited to the aforementioned undertakings. (2) Subsidies granted for reforming the financial system; provinces, cities, and counties that re-levy various central taxes or collect surtaxes should abolish them. However, if, due to special circumstances, funds to compensate for the abolition cannot be raised, it may be presented to the Executive Yuan for phased abolition, or the central government may recover and reorganize and grant subsidies for at least two years.

IV. Conclusion

The implementation of the public treasury system and the revenue and expenditure system law can indeed enhance the structure of China's finance and improve wartime finance, and it can also lay the foundation for future national construction finance. With the implementation of the public treasury system, the four powers of financial administration can be established. With the implementation of the revenue and expenditure system, the financial strength of counties can be enriched so as to achieve county autonomy, and only then can constitutional government be achieved. Therefore, the implementation of this law is a major improvement in China's postwar finance.

### Brief Discussion on Controlled Economy by Yan Maode

Modern economic systems have a very large shortcoming, which is that with the development of culture and knowledge to this day, there are several obvious phenomena: (1) There is no shortage of natural resources, (2) The skills given to us by scientific knowledge have greatly improved compared to the past, and (3) The organizational ability of labor has increased compared to the past. These three phenomena reveal this shortcoming, which is that they cannot reconcile the progress of human life. The technology of scientific knowledge and the organization of the labor sector cannot be applied to natural resources, so that the standard of human life has not yet reached the level it should be. Natural resources are abundant, but there is still poverty in abundance, which is an undesirable phenomenon. Then, only partial improvements can be made, but whether partial improvements can guarantee the prosperity of the national economy is a real question. Therefore, the economic organization should be improved, and a systematic improvement as a whole should replace partial improvements, which will benefit the national economy.

The controlled economy has developed to this day due to special reasons: (1) As a result of the previous World War, when the war was in progress, countries adopted considerable control in order to control their own resources to strengthen their resistance. Therefore, the success of the controlled economy is due to the war. (2) Due to the Soviet Union's five-year plan. The material civilization of the Soviet Union under the extreme socialist experiment has made considerable progress, which proves that natural resources can be combined with scientific technology and labor organization to achieve good results, which is of course a stimulus to capitalist countries. (3) Due to the inspiration of Fascism, Italy is not a country that restricts the private property system, but the government imposes a restriction on its utilization and activities, and it has achieved considerable effectiveness, which has led to the imitation of countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. (4) Due to the rationalization movement of industry, the meaning of this movement is to connect the production of the country with its consumer market, indirectly solving unemployment or poverty. What the United Kingdom and the United States imitated is not the Soviet Union's five-year plan or Italy's restriction on private property, but a general broad system, namely, the controlled economy. (5) Due to the world's depression, the world's depression shrouded all countries, resulting in excess goods in production, uncertainty in transactions, insufficient purchasing power in consumption, and an imbalance in the payment of goods in distribution. This anarchic economic state must be improved, which is the so-called implementation of a controlled economy. (6) Due to the shortcomings of the modern political system, the elections of democratic politics are based on geographical units, and the elected members of parliament inevitably include those who are ignorant, and even those who are ignorant of specialized economic knowledge, which will inevitably affect the efficiency of administration. Therefore, countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States are adopting economic control. (7) Due to the emergence of the idea of economic groups. The United States will naturally form an economic group in North and South America in terms of its political status. The so-called economic groups are all within this scope, and the basis for adjusting economic activities, such as the British Empire forming a group with colonies and self-governing territories, many countries in Central Europe also forming several groups due to geographical connections, such as Danzig Poland, etc., in the Far East, Japan, including China and Manchuria, also attempted to form an economic group, which can be said to be caused by political ambitions.

At present, the politics and economy of various countries in the world have the color of a controlled economy, and the possibility of this is not a problem. However, there are two aspects to the degree of development of the possibility: (1) How to implement the controlled organization. (2) How coercive is this organization. Under which of these two organizations can the purpose of control be achieved, which completely depends on the organization of the controlled economy and the different national status and background. The Soviet Union's political organization is managed by the Controlled Economic Commission, so that it can have the Soviet Union's controlled economic policy. Italy's political organization is based on the National Union Council to have Italy's controlled economic policy, while the United Kingdom and France also have their own different controlled policies. Therefore, the different degrees of controlled economy in various countries are actually formed by the different political, economic, and organizational backgrounds of various countries. It can be seen from this that no country in the world can achieve the same effect in the controlled economy, all because of the different environments of various countries. In other words, the determination of the degree of a country's controlled economy should be based on the country's political background as the key point for determining the policy of the controlled economy. If you only know how to imitate the policies of other countries, I am afraid that you may not be able to get good results.

Recently, persimmon cakes have been actively sold by the Nanjing and Hangzhou gangs, the market is unusually lively. A batch was sold yesterday, including 200 cases of boxed row cakes, 44 yuan, and 300 cases of bagged green cakes, 40 yuan.

### Piece Goods – Plain Serge Soars

The price of plain-colored thin serge has suddenly soared recently. The opening price for the Dalong Yangcheng brand is 15 yuan, the Zhanghua 918 sells for 15.5 yuan, the price for the Da Guangming brand is 16 yuan, and the price for the Yinfeng God of Wealth Tiger brand is 17 yuan. Grass yellow and grass green still need to add a few corners. The reason for the sharp rise is that the factory said that raw materials are scarce, and the cost of future products will increase, so they are hoarding and raising the price of inventory. The stores also follow suit. However, as the most popular product in the woolen fabric market, and with no Western goods arriving for sale, it is also a major reason.

### Shanghai Flour Market in the 29th Year of the Republic (Continued)

— Zhou Xigeng

Then he occasionally acted as an agent for fellow merchants to buy and sell flour and bran, which was not valued by the outside world at this time. Subsequently, the Shanghai flour market repeatedly changed, the supply of flour from this factory decreased, and prices gradually rose. These people took the opportunity to fuel the flames and profit from it. For example, when it was not easy to buy flour from this factory in the regular market, it could be bought at a slightly higher price than the factory price in the black market. As for the source of these flour chips, it was from some greedy flour merchants who, after buying from the factory, did not sell it in stores, but took it to the black market to sell it, which could make more profit. By this time, some legitimate flour merchants had also gradually entered the market to trade. By the time the factory's flour was supplied and sold at a flat price, the chips were scarce, and foreign flour became the main transaction. As for the price of flour from this factory, the cost increased, and the speed of the price increase from January to December of last year (1939) was unprecedented. A table is shown below: (Unit: Yuan) (Price per bag of flour)

Looking at the table above, the price of flour has doubled in one year, which is still the official factory price. The price of flour in the black market is even more. The upward trend in the table above was more intense in the second half of the year, mainly because at this time, foreign wheat was subject to foreign exchange contraction, and various expenses increased, resulting in a large increase in costs. Comparing the flour prices in the years after the war can give us great surprises, and they are recorded as follows:

Year Price (Unit: Yuan) per bag

December of the 26th year of the Republic (1937) 4.35

December of the 27th year of the Republic (1938) 4.80

December of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) 4.70

December of the 29th year of the Republic (1940) 18.00

From the flour prices listed above, it can be seen that the rise in flour prices was the fastest from the 27th year to the 29th year of the Republic (1938-1940), and at this time, foreign flour took the opportunity to dump, and its momentum was alarming. Looking at the table below, you can see a glimpse.

Year Net Value of Imported Foreign Flour (Unit: Yuan)

26th year of the Republic (1937) 6,183,000

27th year of the Republic (1938) 52,985,000

28th year of the Republic (1939) 76,817,000 Although domestic flour has increased in price, due to insufficient raw materials and narrow sales channels and a poor environment, it cannot be produced in large quantities, allowing foreign flour to dump at low prices, which is regrettable.

(V) A Humble Prediction of the Future Trend of the Flour Market

At present, the largest flour mills in the Shanghai concession area are the Fuxin and Fufeng mills owned by Chinese merchants. Unfortunately, the raw materials are controlled by others, and they cannot exert their great power. It is rumored that the factory has ordered many ships of foreign wheat, the number of which is huge. One ship has arrived, and more are expected to arrive successively. Therefore, the raw materials of this factory's flour can be worked for several months without worry. There are still about one million bags of foreign flour ordered by Shanghai merchants that are on their way. It is estimated that there are no less than 400,000 bags of flour in stock in this port. With such information, Shanghai flour merchants in panic will inevitably be stunned. It is heard that the flat-priced flour organized by the Public Works Department will continue to be held, and the bread, steamed bun, and sliced noodle industries in this port can still buy it, and the sales of flour are not seen to be lessened. The northern gang has stopped doing it for a long time, and even if there are occasional ones, it is nothing more than speculation. The southern gang occasionally gets involved, but it is difficult to fix. Now, let's take the current supply of about 7,000 bags of flour from this factory per day as an example. The food sales of flour in this port have been able to maintain, and there are still other industrial applications that account for about 2,000 bags per day, which can be compensated by the foreign flour arriving in Shanghai. Moreover, the amount of flour purchased and stored by various sectors in advance is imagined to be not small, right? Therefore, there is really no reason to panic about the supply and demand of the entire Shanghai flour market. Although it cannot be said that it can be maintained for a long time, it can at least supply the residents of the isolated island with more than ten months of wheat food. Furthermore, summer is approaching, and new wheat will be on the market soon. Although it cannot be said that it can be transported into the concession, in terms of business, it can ultimately reduce some of the false fears. From this point of view, whether the price of flour will rise again is more than half of what we think. I would like to say one more word to speculative merchants. Whenever the price of flour rises sharply, buyers rush to be the first, fearing to be behind. However, this kind of sales does not come from actual needs, but is a completely speculative scalping behavior. If it stagnates, it will be sold cheaply, and I am afraid that those who receive it will not want to buy it, because those who really need flour for application have a considerable amount of inventory in their hands that can be used for allocation, and they will never dig a well when they are thirsty and search for it on the market. Even if there are some, they are very few, and the sellers are speculative, not real sales. At this time, the selling heart is more eager, and there are fewer recipients, resulting in a one-sided situation. These things have been seen many times in the past. It is credible that the rise in market prices, if it follows the law of supply and demand, will not be excessively expensive. Conversely, excessively expensive is the development of an abnormal state, and the result will inevitably collapse. If you don't believe me, watch what happens later. (End)

### Labor Union Election Begins; Chinese Directors and Commissioners to Remain in Office; British and American Reinforcements Intensify, Moving in Unison; Japanese Residents' Association Elects Representatives

Following the American Chamber of Commerce's nomination of Mr. A____ and Mr. McMorran as candidates for the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Directorate on Friday evening, the 1941 SMC directorate election campaign officially commenced. This early initiation perhaps foreshadows a repeat of last year's thrilling events. With the American candidates already announced, the British are expected to follow suit shortly, nominating five candidates as per usual. However, the Japanese side's intentions remain unknown. The period from today until April 2nd or 3rd will likely see rapid developments, as the candidate lists must be submitted to the authorities by noon on March 25th. A reporter inquired with American candidate McMorran about his views on being selected. He reportedly stated that negotiations were "still in progress." However, when the reporter informed him that the news had spread widely in the press, Mr. McMorran frankly admitted that he had been asked to fill the vacancy left by Mr. Kanar, who recently returned to his home country, and that he had agreed to this request. Mr. McMorran's resolute commitment to municipal work is a first step, and many believe he will live up to expectations.

Chinese Directors and Commissioners to Remain in Office

According to sources within the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, due to current circumstances, a meeting of Chinese taxpayer representatives will be convened in a week to discuss the selection process for the Chinese members of the SMC Directorate for this year. However, the majority of Chinese residents advocate for the re-election of the current five Chinese directors: Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, and Chen Tingrui, seeing no need for change. The six Chinese commissioners of the SMC for 1941-1942 will also be re-elected as per usual. Additionally, one member of the Land Committee must be selected. The current Chinese commissioners are Lin Kanghou, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Liu Shifang, Li Wenjie, and Chen Tingrui. Jin Zongcheng is the Land Committee member. Except for Lin Kanghou, who has left Shanghai, all others are still in the city.

British and Americans Decide to Adopt a United Front

The Shanghai International Settlement is the last economic stronghold of Great Britain and the United States, and they are unwilling to allow its administration to fall under Japanese control, thereby destroying the assets and interests they have cultivated and possessed for over a century since the port's opening. If the Japanese attempt to alter the status quo and secure more seats on the SMC Directorate, a fierce contest is inevitable. However, the Japanese side has yet to express its attitude towards this election. Following the Lin Xiongji affair, the arson attack on Moriyasu Matsunosuke and Kubo Akihiro, the Japanese feel uneasy due to criticism from both Chinese and foreign public opinion. Nevertheless, the Japanese began preparing for this election as early as a year ago. The British and Americans are well aware that only by adopting a united front even stronger than last year's can they defeat the Japanese. The intensity of the upcoming election can be imagined. According to Great China News Agency reporters, besides the American Chamber of Commerce holding a meeting at the Foochow Road clubhouse on the 7th, the British Chamber of Commerce will also hold a meeting at the British Women's Association on the Bund to discuss strategies to cooperate with the Americans in response.

Continuing to Uphold the Gentleman's Agreement

Yesterday, some newspapers claimed that British and American residents held differing opinions on this election and that the British even intended to increase their number of director seats while some Americans were withdrawing from Shanghai. According to a well-informed source close to the SMC, this claim is entirely unfounded. The source believes that the purpose of such reports is to sow discord between British and American residents, disrupt their united front, and achieve ulterior motives. However, such efforts are futile, as residents of both countries will not fall for these tricks. The source confidently asserts that the British have no intention of violating the "five-two-two" gentleman's agreement between the British, Americans, and Japanese. The question of which country harbors such ambition is self-evident.

Japanese Residents Elect Representatives

Since the arrest of Lin Xiongji, the Japanese have strengthened the Japanese Residents' Association. Under the designation of the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, 25 representatives were elected from various social strata of the Japanese community in Shanghai. According to foreign sources, Mr. Kanzo Uchiyama, who has resided in Shanghai for over 30 years, has been elected as one of the key representatives to gain an advantage for the Japanese in the upcoming SMC Directorate election. Mr. Uchiyama has lived in Shanghai for many years and is well-versed in Chinese affairs. He founded Uchiyama Bookstore and enjoys considerable prestige among the Japanese community.

### Arrest of Teachers at Zhonghe Elementary School: Only Two Were Arrested; Handed Over to the Japanese Yesterday

The Zhonghe Elementary School at No. 11, Lane 89, Rue Bourgeat, French Concession, was raided on the morning before last by the Japanese, accompanied by Chinese and Western detectives from the Criminal Section of the French Concession Police, who arrested three teachers. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to an investigation by the Pingming News Agency, only two people were arrested at the time, not three. The details are as follows:

Living and Eating at the School, Not Involved in External Affairs

Zhonghe Elementary School, located at No. 11, Lane 89, at the intersection of Rue Bourgeat and Route En Se, was founded by a local man named Zhu Guowei (36 years old). Since the principalship of ______, the school has been registered with the Bureau of Education and has many students, currently over 700. Zhu's fourth younger brother, Zhu Peigang, 27 years old, graduated from Beiguang Middle School and then studied at the Shanghai College of Law and Politics. He is currently an English teacher at the school. Chen Jiwen, a graduate of the Suzhou Chenglie Physical Education School, has been hired as a gymnastics teacher. Chen is from Kunshan and is 25 years old. Both Zhu and Chen wear Western suits and live and eat at the school. They do not involve themselves in external affairs other than teaching.

Arrested During a Short Break After Class

At approximately 9:50 a.m. on the morning before last, Japanese personnel accompanied by Chinese and Western police officers from the Criminal Section of the French Concession Police arrived at the school in two black cars (one identified as No. 1099, the number of the other unknown). At that time, the first class had just ended. Chen Jiwen was taking a short break in the teachers' room, and Zhu Peigang was slowly walking down from the classroom upstairs. The Japanese personnel and detectives, without asking any questions, first arrested Zhu Peigang and then went to the teachers' room and, after inquiring about Chen Jiwen's name, also took him into custody and drove away quickly to the east in the waiting car.

Handed Over to the Japanese Yesterday Morning

They were first taken to the Sungshan Road police station, where they were questioned about their names, ages, and native places. The Japanese only wrote down numbers related to the Japanese Gendarmerie of the Hongkou Concession, and then they were taken away in the original car towards Hongkou. Their whereabouts remain unknown. According to someone at the school, both Zhu and Chen were conscientious and did not engage in any wrongdoing. They have never been involved in political activities. This sudden arrest is truly puzzling. According to Shewen News Agency, the two teachers were handed over to the Japanese yesterday morning after being taken to the French police station. It is said that the arrest was based on a tip-off, accusing the two of being involved in something, which led to the arrest.

### Zhang Zhizhong Sends Condolences to the Family of Jin Huating

General Zhang Zhizhong sent a telegram of condolence to the family of Jin Huating, stating: "To the family of Mr. Jin Huating, c/o Shen Bao: I was deeply saddened to hear the tragic news of Mr. Jin Huating's death at the hands of the enemy. Mr. Huating was known for his integrity and respected in journalistic circles. His passing is mourned by all. The spirit of a patriot never dies, and the righteous spirit of the nation will endure. He has set an example for generations to come. I send my deepest condolences and hope that you will find solace. Zhang Zhizhong."

### Japanese Transport Ship Sinks After Hitting Reef in Chongming Waters

According to Japanese claims yesterday, a transport ship, Yushun Maru (over 1,000 tons), loaded with coal from Qingdao to Shanghai, ran aground on a reef off Dongshawu Island, Chongming Island, at noon on the 8th due to sudden heavy fog. The hull was pierced, and seawater rushed in rapidly. The ship immediately sent a distress call, which was received by Nagasaki, who urgently telegraphed the navy for assistance. As a result, the 30-plus crew members escaped in small boats. However, the ship has sunk. The Japanese navy has dispatched ships to provide assistance.

### Strict Plague Inspection

According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the Jianghai Customs continues to strictly inspect ships arriving from ports in Zhejiang Province for plague, refusing to lift restrictions. This is because plague is still present in Qu County and Pingyang. However, the plague within Ningbo has long been brought under control.

### Retiring American Vice-Chairman of SMC, Mr. Kanar, Leaves Shanghai for America This Morning; Chinese and Western Friends See Him Off at the Dock; General Manager of SMC, Mr. Kaison, Returns to Shanghai at the End of the Month After Vacation

Mr. Kanar, the American Vice-Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), has retired due to his advanced age. After submitting his resignation to the authorities, Chinese and Western friends have held farewell banquets for him. Mr. Kanar is scheduled to leave Shanghai for America at 10:00 AM today on the Clipper, which is currently docked at Pier 12, No. 3 Buoy. The Jianghai Customs passenger launch, Marie Muller, is scheduled to depart from the Jianghai Customs dock at 8:30 AM this morning. Mr. Kanar will transfer via the launch. Chinese and Western friends, as well as senior officials from the SMC and the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP), will be present at the dock to see him off.

Mr. Kaison to Return to Shanghai at the End of the Month

Mr. Kaison, the General Manager of the SMC, has signed the Shanghai West Police Rights Agreement and attended the Special Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers, which reopened on the 5th, since the Lin Xiongji shooting. Yet, due to his injuries not fully healed, he left Shanghai on the American President Lines' President Monroe on the 7th to recuperate in Hong Kong. According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, Mr. Kaison is scheduled to return to Shanghai at the end of this month to resume his duties.

### Clearing Up National Rice Sources: Negotiations Gradually Approaching Conclusion; Results May Be Achieved After Further Discussion

The Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council previously proposed seven measures to improve the rice market and instructed their immediate implementation. It is reported that the Rice Market Management Committee, in an effort to eliminate existing malpractices and restore fair trading regulations, plans to convene a full committee meeting soon to discuss concrete measures for reorganizing the rice market, with the aim of rigorously suppressing illegal transactions in the rice market. Representatives from the Bean and Rice Guilds will be invited to attend, and instructions will be given to guide their decisions.

Progress in Clearing Up National Rice Sources

A Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from related sources in the city that the authorities of the two concessions have been repeatedly consulting with the "City Government" regarding the clearing of national rice sources, requesting that they find ways to supply a certain amount of national rice each month to supplement the people's food reserves. However, due to numerous difficulties, no progress has been made. It is still actively in progress. However, authorities revealed that progress is being made on the aforementioned matter of clearing national rice sources. They expect that results may be achieved after further discussions. According to rice industry sources, clearing national rice sources is an urgent task that cannot be delayed any longer, as the cost of transporting national rice to Shanghai is low, the time is short, and the quality is better than that of foreign rice. Due to the "control" effect, the monthly shipment volume to Shanghai is not as smooth as before, so they sincerely hope that the authorities will make further efforts to promote its realization.

Awaiting Funding for the Ninth Term of Price Stabilization

It has been decided that the ninth term of price stabilization rice sales will continue. However, the concrete measures are still actively in progress. As it is the Lunar New Year, all industries and rice shops are on holiday, so it is temporarily impossible to proceed. However, there is a great need for funds. Although there are still many people who have donated recently, they are not as enthusiastic as before. It is hoped that all industries, guilds, large and small factories, and warm-hearted people from all walks of life will continue their efforts to assist in raising funds for the low-price rice, so that the ninth term of price stabilization can begin as soon as possible, and ordinary people can benefit.

### Barber Shops on Avenue Joffre Strike Again; Request to Change the Previous Agreement of 30% Profit Sharing to 35%

At the end of the lunar year, the barbers in various barber shops struck because they requested employers to improve their treatment. The authorities mediated, negotiations were reached, and work was resumed. However, because the conditions were not fully agreed upon at the time, major barber shops have not been resolved until now, causing more complications. The barbers of six larger barber shops, Xinhua, Paris, Yuegong, Avenue Joffre, White Rose, and its branches along Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, jointly went on strike yesterday morning, requesting employers to increase profit sharing by five points. Representatives from both sides are currently negotiating. The conditions for the previous resumption of work were: 12 hours of work per day, from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM, with profit sharing of 70% for the employer and 30% for the barber for every dollar, and the employer provides food and lodging, with three meals and two bowls of rice and one bowl of porridge per day. Depending on the skill level, the employer gives each barber a monthly salary ranging from five to six yuan to over twenty yuan. The barbers of the six barber shops now on strike are requesting that for every dollar, the employer receive six and a half cents and the barber two and a half cents. Negotiations are currently underway.

### Fierce Battles Along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Near Zhangzhu

Along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the Japanese have recently erected dense networks of electric fences. Steel-reinforced concrete bunkers are increasingly being built at strategic locations. Military telephone lines are being set up along highways to facilitate communication. In the countryside, roads are being hastily constructed to allow heavy weapons to be deployed as needed and defensive positions established in important towns for a small number of Japanese troops. However, Chinese troops frequently cross the railway line at night, using only two large door panels to overturn the two-meter-high electric fences. Thousands of soldiers can then safely proceed to sabotage the roads, a routine activity for the Chinese forces. The "sawtooth" digging method is also highly effective. Most of the Chinese regular forces are concentrated in the mountains of Zhangzhu, southeast of Yixing. Consequently, fierce battles frequently occur there. At the end of last month, it was reported that the Japanese troops were once surrounded. Chinese forces utilize the advantageous terrain to maintain a military advantage.

Soaring Prices Along the Railway Line

The soaring prices along the railway line are truly alarming. Daily necessities such as white sugar cost over one yuan per pound, salt costs three pounds per yuan, and fuel, such as soybean firewood, has soared to six yuan per load. Kerosene costs over one yuan per pound. Other items, such as cigarettes, matches, and military paper, are six to seven times to over ten times higher than before the war. Rice also costs around eighty yuan per load. More than 50,000 small traders who are controlled by the Japanese come to Shanghai from counties along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to sell daily necessities, but inspections are very strict.

### Possession of Ministry of Foreign Affairs Passport Permits Free Travel to Hong Kong; Transit Endorsement Fee Only Three Dollars; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Directs Hong Kong Visa Office to Issue

Since Hong Kong implemented the immigration control regulations on the 15th of last month, all travelers going to Hong Kong from abroad, whether for residence or transit, must possess a passport issued by their country's government or a Hong Kong entry permit to be allowed to land. Except for various immigration certificates issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Department, a passport issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, endorsed by the British Ambassador in Chongqing and the British Consulates in various locations, allows free entry to Hong Kong. Applying for this passport is very simple. The applicant needs to provide a guarantee from a business or individual and complete the procedures at the Hong Kong Passport and Visa Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The passport endorsement fee is divided into two types: (1) Transit endorsement fee of HK$3, (2) Residence endorsement fee of HK$13. Both allow legal entry. To facilitate the travel of overseas Chinese, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the Hong Kong Passport and Visa Office to issue this passport to overseas Chinese. According to Mr. Fu Li Shi, Director of the Hong Kong Immigration Department, only passports issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing will be recognized for Chinese citizens; all others will not be accepted.

### North China Youth's Earnest Patriotism: Continuing the Arduous Struggle; Organizing a Condolence Mission to Serve in Free China; Visiting Supreme Authorities to Comfort Frontline Soldiers

According to a recent arrival from Hong Kong, the Xinsheng News Agency reporter was told that youths from schools in Peiping (Beijing) and Tianjin in North China believe that under the leadership of our Supreme Leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the whole nation has been engaged in national reconstruction for nearly four years, and that final victory is imminent. Although the youth of Peiping and Tianjin have been in dire straits for four years, they continue their arduous struggle. Recently, they organized a "North China Youth Condolence Mission" and ventured out of North China, arriving safely in Hong Kong and transferring to the interior to pay their respects and offer condolences to the Supreme Leader, soldiers, wounded soldiers, and displaced compatriots. Mr. Song, a representative of the mission, spoke to the reporter in Hong Kong about the purpose of the trip and the situation of the youth in North China in detail. The details are as follows:

Longing for the Motherland

The purpose of this mission is to go to Chongqing to pay our respects to the Central Government and, along the way, to express our condolences to the commanders and soldiers, wounded soldiers, and refugees in the various war zones, as well as to visit and sweep the tombs of the martyred soldiers. This time we came from the rear, overcoming many difficulties and hardships. What we brought from North China is materially nothing, but only the hearts of all the North China youth who are loyal to the motherland, and the boiling blood of longing for the motherland. Now that they have come to Hong Kong from North China via Shanghai and transferred to the mainland, the representatives can see the national flag again and read our righteous newspapers. Everyone could not help but shed tears and feel overwhelmed. Their inner excitement and the loveliness of breathing free air cannot be fully described by those who have lived in hardship for four years.

Extremely Strict Inspections

The strictness of the inspections in North China is remarkable. Even traveling from Tianjin to Peiping, there are as many as eighteen inspections. The person responsible for the inspection is the passenger traveling next to you, who is completely unaware beforehand that they are plainclothes detectives. At present, there is a special phenomenon in North China that is unknown to outsiders, that is, the sales of Japanese goods in North China are decreasing day by day.

Sabotaging Transportation

As for guerrilla activities, although the Peiping-Tianjin area is heavily guarded, their methods of sabotage are constantly evolving. For example, in the past, guerrillas often sabotaged railways by digging up the rails or digging traps under the rails to overturn passing trains. However, now, before each train departs, a hand-cranked car leads the way and personnel are dispatched to inspect the tracks. Therefore, the guerrillas have changed their methods, removing the iron nails from the tracks and replacing them with large radishes cut into the shape of rail nails and placed in the original position of the rail nails. In this way, the hand-cranked car and track inspectors cannot easily detect it. However, when military or other trains with very heavy weight pass, they are overturned or stopped from moving forward, and the guerrillas can come out and attack.

### Radio and Telegraph Technical Personnel Not Allowed to Change Professions Easily

The radio and telegraph technical operators and telegraphers of the radio stations and bureaus under the Ministry of Transportation often resign or take sick leave on the pretext, and privately ask people to introduce them to various military and political organizations, or apply to work for other banks, companies, and public and private organizations. Such fickleness affects the telegraph and radio industry deeply. The authorities have issued a notice strictly ordering all military and political organizations, as well as public and private organizations, to prohibit the recruitment of such technical telegraph and radio personnel.

### In Memory of Mr. Xiong Deshan

— Nanhu

It was on a dusk two years ago, the spring chill still biting, the evening breeze mournfully sighing. I had just undressed, ready to sleep, when I received a call from Mr. Qian Tieru, saying, "A telegram from Guilin reports that Mr. Xiong Deshan passed away from illness in Liangfeng two days ago!" Hearing this, I was deeply shaken. I recalled that Mr. Xiong had decided to go from Shanghai to Guilin after our army retreated from Shanghai after the August 13th Incident. At that time, I was very concerned about his health, fearing he would not be able to withstand the hardships of the rear during such extraordinary times. However, I was also beset by difficulties and did not have the means to keep him temporarily in Shanghai. I could only watch him take his elderly and young family, inquiring along the way, to Guilin. Little did I expect that this departure would be a final farewell! As I was mourning, Mr. Qian had already arrived at my apartment. After showing me the telegram from Guilin, he broke down in tears at the desk. I, too, was overwhelmed with grief! Throughout his life, he was a revolutionary activist in his youth, a vanguard in introducing socialist theories in his middle age, and a pure, rigorous scholar in his later years. Except for the last few years when we were each bound by our duties and our contact became somewhat less frequent, we had lived together for many years in the past thirty years, so I know his life in the most detail. Venerable elders are withering, old friends are scattered, and during this period of grave national crisis, it is an immense loss both publicly and privately.

In the Bingwu year of the Guangxu reign of the Former Qing Dynasty (1906), just as the Russo-Japanese War had recently ended and the Qing court was intent on reforms, there was a two-level elementary school attached to a middle school in Haoxue, under the jurisdiction of Jiangling County in Hubei. Mr. Xiong, Mr. Qian, Ning Dunwu, and I were all students there. Originally, schools had just begun to flourish at that time, and according to regulations, only those who had passed the imperial examination could enter state-run middle schools. However, although those of us around twenty years old had not passed the exam, we had read quite a few old books. Naturally, we were embarrassed to attend elementary school, but we could not enter the palace school either. This unique attached middle school, with the nature of a preparatory school, was specifically set up for people like us. At that time, new ideas from overseas had deeply penetrated the mainland, and many students were influenced. We came from farming families, and each of us had cultivated the land ourselves. We were very 　　about life outside and also possessed a very fierce ambition to go out and make a career. That summer, I failed the entrance exam for the police academy and enlisted as a soldier in Wuchang, returning to my hometown in late autumn. Mr. Xiong and others were still studying at the school, and we had become very close friends.

The following year, Xiong and Qian went to Japan to study abroad. I also went to a school in Beijing in the Wushen year of Guangxu (1908). We often communicated with each other, discussing revolution. After the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), someone organized the Gongjinhui (Progressive Alliance) in Japan, and both of them joined as members. However, soon after, both of them joined the Tongmenghui again. This is said to be the beginning of Mr. Xiong's participation in revolutionary organizations. After graduating and returning to China, seeing the situation of general students seeking official positions, they felt very dissatisfied and returned to their hometown to continue farming and instill revolutionary ideas in the local people. In the Jiyou year of the Xuantong reign (1909), Li Yaoqu and I were studying in the forestry department of the Baoding Advanced Agricultural School. In the year of their return to China, we sent a letter inviting them to the northern student groups to promote the revolutionary movement. So Mr. Xiong went to Baoding and was admitted to the advanced normal department of the agricultural school, while Mr. Qian went to Beijing to study at the Advanced Industrial School. Before long, we had united many revolutionary youths around us, but at that time we were unable to contact the Tongmenghui, so we founded the Republican Association. In the Gengxu year (1910), the movement to petition for the convocation of a national assembly swept the country. In Baoding, the students of our forestry department first launched it, and all schools in Baoding, except for the military academy, unanimously went on strike in response. In this movement, the Republican Association played a major leading role. In Baoding alone, there were more than three thousand comrades in the Republican Association. I took the opportunity to go to 　　Tianjin and other places to send out 　　organizations. When I returned to Baoding, the agricultural school was surrounded by military police, and they also 　　me. I had no choice but to suspend my studies and go to Jiangxi. Mr. Xiong was elected as the representative to go to Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan and other places, going directly to Wuhan with the Beijing representatives, but without much result, they 　　returned to their hometown. The next spring, he 　　went to Baoding again and transferred to the Veterinary School to study.

In the early autumn of the Xinhai year, 　　he went north from northern Hubei to inspect the Common Benefit 　　work. Mr. Xiong was still in Baoding presiding over the headquarters of the association. On the eve of the Wuchang Uprising, they knew that I and Ning Dunwu were participating in the revolution in Wuchang, so they gathered the cadres at the Lianchi Academy in Baoding and assigned comrades to various places to make arrangements, preparing to raise the banner. He, Zhang Wen, and Liu Xinru were responsible for planning and directing the responsibility. In mid-September, I was in Hanyang participating in the Guang 　　battle. One after another, Tongmenghui comrades Leng Gongjian and Yang Shijie came to Hubei from Beijing via secret routes, reporting on the high tide of the revolution in the north, saying that Mr. Xiong and Mr. Qian were contacting the army to arrange an uprising in Beijing. Because Yuan Shikai's father and son's responding troops sat idly by, the event failed. More than ten people, including Li Hanjie, died as martyrs. Mr. Xiong was spared and went to Tianjin, knowing that I had abandoned the Republican Association and was cooperating with various revolutionary groups in the north as a whole. He worked in the general headquarters. Then, together with me, my deceased wife Sun Weiqiang, and female comrades Li Fen, Wang Juehe and others, we transported weapons and ammunition to Baoding. Unfortunately, we were quickly avoided by the Qing officials.

The funds I carried were soon exhausted. … The work in the north was extremely tense and there was a pressing need for money. In our extreme anxiety, we consulted with Gong Shanzhi, the quartermaster of the garrison in Hanliushu in the suburbs of Tianjin, and borrowed more than 6,000 silver dollars of military pay from his two battalions. We immediately loaded them onto a carriage and took them directly to the general headquarters in Xiaobailou in the British Concession in Tianjin. Unexpectedly, the police station detected it and, together with the British Public Works Department, surrounded the headquarters and confiscated all the 　　silver documents during the search. At that time, I and more than ten comrades, including Mr. Xiong, were trapped in it. I had been captured by the British and was about to be taken away. Just as I was about to go out the door, Mr. Xiong suddenly shouted, "You've arrested the wrong person!" and admitted that it was all his doing. The detective released me and arrested him instead. His intention was 　　because at that time, I needed to preside over everything. If I went to prison, the work would come to a standstill. Therefore, he stepped forward to take my place. That spirit of selfless righteousness still moves me to tears. Later, in the name of the representative of the Hubei military governor, I 　　met the British consul to argue strongly, and he was released only on the third day. Soon after, after several uprisings in 　　Xuzhou independence and Tianjin and other places, the Qing emperor abdicated.

During the process of the north-south peace talks during the Xinhai Revolution, we deeply felt that the peace with Yuan Shikai was a mistake. We sent more than a dozen telegrams to Nanjing and Wuchang, opposing the peace. When the peace was concluded, we immediately published the Greater China Daily in Tianjin to continue advocating revolution. However, at that time, the revolutionary work in the north had in fact come to an end, so we handed over the newspaper to others and returned to Hubei. In May, Governor Li Yuanhong appointed me to handle the aftermath of the Manchu people in Jingzhou. I raised funds locally in Jingzhou and established schools and factories to settle the scattered Manchu soldiers. Mr. Xiong served as the general manager of the Civilian Factory. In the spring of the second year of the Republic, I was elected as a member of the House of Representatives and went north to attend the meeting. He continued to be responsible for Jingzhou, working hard for more than a year, and the jobless Manchu people benefited greatly from him. After he handed over his post, he lived in seclusion in the countryside, establishing a private school to teach new knowledge to the children of poor farmers who could not afford to go to school. He also occasionally participated in local affairs. (To be continued)

### Refusal to Pay Village Bank Notes: Silver Firms and Qian Zhuang in Litigation; Payer Claims Right to Recover Notes; Triangular Lawsuit Awaits Investigation and Review

Shen Dizhuang, manager of Zhengxiang Tongji Qian Zhuang at No. 15 Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road, was recently sued by Hong Shuliang, manager of Dingtai Yong Silver Firm at No. 17 Changweng Lane, Tianjin Road, through lawyer Mao Xianshen to the Civil Court of the First Special Court for failing to honor payment on notes. Judge Ni presided over the third civil court session to summon the parties. The plaintiff's attorney stated the allegations, claiming that the plaintiff was conducting

silver firm business

and had regular transactions with the client Ying Yankang (i.e., Kangji). On January 8 of this year, the client delivered an immediate bank note (i.e., village bank note) No. 185 issued by the defendant Zhengxiang Qian Zhuang, with a face value of 18,360 national currency. The plaintiff accepted it as a deposit of 16,000 national currency, which is recorded in the accounts. Subsequently, the note was presented to the Asian Bank for redemption, but was unexpectedly

rejected by the defendant.

The defendant stated that the aforementioned bank note was issued to the client Yonghe Cotton Cloth Firm, which subsequently declared it lost in transit, hence the order to stop payment. However, after this incident occurred, because Yonghe Cotton Cloth Firm reported it to the Zhabei Police Station, the police station dispatched personnel to the plaintiff's location to investigate, concluding that the plaintiff obtained the note in good faith. It was heard that Yonghe Cotton Cloth Firm

was scammed

and lost the bank note, not that it was lost. Since the plaintiff obtained the note in good faith, according to Items 1 and 2 of Article 15 of the Shanghai Money Industry Regulations, the defendant should also pay the plaintiff the note amount of 18,360 yuan. Defendant Shen Dizhuang's attorney, Zhang Bingyun, replied that although the presented bank note was issued by the defendant, since the holder, Yonghe Cotton Cloth Firm, declared it

lost in transit,

payment was stopped. According to money industry custom, the 18,360 yuan note amount was submitted to the Money Industry Association for review. The plaintiff's claims are baseless and should be rejected. Yonghe Cotton Cloth Firm also retained lawyers Fei Xizhen, Wang Heng, and Gu to appear in court, claiming the right to recover the note and receive the payment. After reviewing the court records, the court determined that further investigation and witness testimony were necessary, and adjourned the case to be heard again on the 22nd of this month.

### Sentencing Scheduled for Kang Shoufan Kidnapping Case

Unexpectedly, on the morning of December 11, while Kang was driving his car near the factory on Gongping Road, he was suddenly kidnapped by four bandits. The detectives of the Putuo Road Police Station, Hua Detective Feng Baishun and Wang Yongjun, learned that the suspects in the case were plotting at the Yongan Skating Rink, so they rushed to the address and captured the Pudong bandits Cai Asi (also known as Qiao Sigen) and Ma Guosu (also known as Ma Yingjun). According to their confession, they were charged with starting flesh trade. The two suspects were handed over to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court for questioning. After Judge Jiang Shuzi thoroughly questioned them, the facts of the case were clear, so he declared the debate closed and scheduled sentencing for the 12th.

### Driver Sentenced for Truck Killing Teenager

Li Baoyu, a truck driver from Ningbo, was driving truck number 9529 around 9:00 AM on January 28, near Xihua Road and Minhang Road. The driver was careless and knocked down a 17-year-old boy walking on the road, causing severe head injuries. Li, in a panic, sped away in his truck. The Hongkou Police Station arrived and summoned an ambulance to transport the injured to the Shanghai Leprosarium for treatment. The boy died around 2:00 PM. Li, realizing the enormity of the disaster, had no choice but to surrender to the police station the next morning and was sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for negligent homicide under the criminal law. However, the family of the deceased could not be found to be notified. As a result, Li Baoyu was sentenced to two years in prison as a warning.

### One Thief Executed

He Quangen was sentenced to two years and six months in prison, and the gun and ammunition were confiscated.

### West Shanghai Out-of-Bounds Road Construction: Gambling Dens Face a Dim Future

Since the signing of the Shanghai West Shanghai Police Power Agreement for the area of West Shanghai where roads are built out of bounds, all large and small gambling dens in the area, due to the restrictions of the "Agreement" and the regulations in the annex prohibiting their establishment, will be forced to close. Therefore, they are now preparing to relocate separately. Many plan to move to Nanshi. The Six Nations Hotel on Haige Road has found the old site of the Xiaoshijie in Nanshi and is actively renovating and arranging the site. Other gambling dens on Yuyuan Road, Difeng Road, and Jessfield Road originally planned to move to Nanshi. However, they are deeply afraid of being concentrated in one place, causing mutual exclusion and affecting business. Moreover, transportation in Nanshi is inconvenient and it is difficult to find housing, so the future is bleak. Several places will be closed soon.

### International Cup Soccer Semifinals: China and Portugal Tie 3-3; China First to Score, Tied 2-2 in Regulation Time; Each Score Again in 30-Minute Overtime, Still a Draw

The 1940-41 International Cup soccer tournament, in which seven nations are vying for supremacy, has reached the semifinals following the preliminary round where Portugal defeated the World Team, China defeated England, and the Jewish team defeated Russia. France advanced unchallenged. The semifinal round features competition between China, Portugal, the Jewish team, and France. As a result of the drawing of lots, France faced the Jewish team, while China faced Portugal. Counting the International Cup since 1938, it is now the third year in which China and Portugal have met in the semifinal week. In the previous semifinal match between China and Portugal, the result was a lopsided 5-0 score. In the past, when China and Portugal met in a championship match, the referee's dereliction of duty in awarding China a dubious penalty kick resulted in China being humiliated by the Portuguese team a second time. Unexpectedly, in the International Cup two years later, China and Portugal again meet in the semifinals. When the two sides met at the Yiyuan yesterday morning, the crowd reached over 16,000 people. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie. After switching sides, the Portuguese team took the lead again. Fortunately, Sun Jinshun reversed the misfortune in the last two minutes, creating a 2-2 tie. In the 30-minute overtime period, the Portuguese team again had the advantage. Finally, relying on the blessings of heaven for China, Dai Linjing scored with one kick. From then on, the Chinese team's offensive was heated, but it still ended in a 3-3 tie. In the future, a selection will be made 　　to determine the winner. The two teams lined up as follows:

Chinese Team

Portuguese Team

Victorious Start

As the teams lined up for battle, the Portuguese team won the right to attack first. After the mobilization order was issued, the Portuguese team did not gain any ground, and Liang Shutang intercepted the ball. The Chinese team drove straight in, and the Portuguese team hurriedly met the challenge, but it was blocked into a corner kick. Awan sent the ball in, just right, but Youliang's steps were too heavy and he flew towards the sky. The Portuguese team counterattacked. Gaine took a free kick from 20 yards out. Fonseca fell in front of the goal and missed a great opportunity. In the 13th minute of the stalemate, Old Sun Jinshun knocked hard near the goal, hitting the post and bouncing back. The Chinese team besieged, and in a minute of melee, Liang Shutang took a free kick, and Li Yichen intercepted it with one kick, hitting the lower left corner squarely. China had a victorious start. Firecrackers sounded from the stands (1-0).

Each Side Ties

Before long, Dai Linjing was injured in battle and left the field temporarily. The Chinese team fought with fewer men, and the momentum inevitably diminished slightly. The Portuguese team, led by Rocha Liao Gaine, frequently attacked, but fortunately they were not successful. Not long after the rampage, the Chinese team regained control of the situation. Zhang Lin'gen cleared the ball with a big kick. After that, the Chinese team frequently encountered misfortunes. Huang Kehou accidentally collided with Gaine, and Costan took a free kick, which fortunately grazed the crossbar and flew away. Before long, Lin'gen committed a foul, and Qin Bigao held the ball and ran four steps, and the bullet was stopped. However, they also turned danger into safety. But at 37 minutes, L. Rocha Liao received support from Colasa, and was finally shot in the red heart, and tied by one point. The first half ended in a tie.

Dark Period

After switching sides to continue the battle, the Portuguese team's offensive suddenly intensified. Fortunately, the Chinese team's A Li, A Dai, and A Jia put on a wonderful small-triangle passing. A Jia lobbed the ball, but was caught by Su Ruo who rushed out to catch it. And Wan Jin's Old Sun Shutang took three shots in a row, but none hit the target. At 16 minutes, Costan took a free kick, directly hitting the corner of the goal. Fortunately, it hit the goalpost. After a chaotic battle, it finally became a corner kick. Fonseca sent the ball in, and Gaine passed it to Blat. Blat passed it to the same back, and Gaine shot a cold arrow. Qin Bigao was trapped in the core, and did not prevent it. The Portuguese team took the lead with 2-1.

Legacy Life Has Soup

The Chinese team's Zhou Liangzeng switched positions to meet the challenge, but the ball was not lucky, and there were still no achievements. There were only two minutes left. The Chinese team still had no progress. When there were only two minutes left, Portuguese J. Rocha Liao violently crashed into Wan Jin in the penalty area. The referee Kanair punished with a penalty kick. Old Sun Jinshun was ordered to enforce the law, and he really succeeded with one arrow, hitting the lower right corner directly. 1-2 turned into a tie again. Suddenly, the audience cheered and the garden was full of spring.

As if facing an abyss

As the tie was secured, the battle was extended for another 30 minutes according to the law. The Chinese army led the attack first. Blat suddenly attacked the goal, and Bigao rescued the dangerous situation. A Dai turned around and gave a wonderful pass, but was blocked by the Portuguese team into a corner kick. A Jia kicked it too high, losing the opportunity. The Chinese army also lost a free kick opportunity. After Old Sun returned to camp to rescue a dangerous ball, A Wan drove straight in, far to Youliang, and after it was sent in, Old Sun raised his left foot and volleyed into the upper left corner, but unfortunately it was one inch away from the crossbar. At 5 minutes, Zhou Qilin took a long pass, and Wan Jin headed for the goal, but was cleverly caught by Su Ruo again. So the Chinese army's bad luck came again. At 7 minutes, Blat took a corner kick, and Costan fired a cold arrow in the crowd. Bigao had not defended it, and watched it enter the net. 3-2, the Portuguese army took the lead again.

Light reappears

The first 15 minutes passed in an instant. At this critical moment, Hua Shen gritted his teeth, A Dai rushed through Remidi's barrier, less than five yards from the goal, and kicked it out, but was caught by Su Ruo again. Fortunately, the Chinese army's offensive was quite strong, and finally in the last four minutes, after Old Sun ejected, Wan Jin took a corner kick, and Old Sun was close to the water tower, intercepted and sent to the center. A Dai raised his feet and slammed into it, cleverly capturing the right corner, 3-3. In the last minute, A Jia rushed through the Remidi barrier, and the three musketeers Dai, Sun and Li gathered in one place, and joined forces to rush. Close to the door, the distance was close, but Old Sun touched it too hard, and before he could raise his foot, he was caught by Su Ruo, and I stepped on it and slammed it, and the great success could have been laid down long ago. Unfortunately, the effort fell short, and China and Portugal ended in a 3-3 tie.

### Members of the New China Drama Troupe to Return Home in Batches at the End of the Month – Long March Abroad Gained Overseas Acclaim – Charity Performances Raised Over Seven Million in June

(Singapore Correspondent) The New China Drama Troupe, organized by domestic film and drama artists Jin Shan, Wang Ying, etc., dedicated themselves to theatrical propaganda in various war zones after the war, travelling through the provinces of Su, Wan, E, Yu, Xiang, Gui, and Yue, and performing over 700 shows as charity performances. In early 1941, to expand overseas propaganda, the troupe held several large-scale fundraising charity performances in Hong Kong and Vietnam, achieving remarkable results. In early 1942, after twists and turns, the troupe arrived in Singapore from Vietnam and took charge of charity performances in Malaya. However, due to environmental factors, they were unable to start work for many months. It was not until early June of last year that they obtained approval from the local government and officially began fundraising charity performances. After holding the first charity performance in Singapore on June 15, they continuously performed great plays such as "Scenery Beyond the Great Wall" (i.e., Yang Hansheng's "Scenery Beyond the Great Wall") and "By the Yongding River" (i.e., Tian Han's "Lugou Bridge"). After four performances, at the strong invitation of the fundraising committees in various parts of Malaya, they left Singapore on August 10 and began a tour of charity performances throughout Malaya, passing through more than twenty large and small places in Johor, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, and Selangor. Wherever they went, they were warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese. In just six months, they raised 1 million Straits dollars, equivalent to more than 7 million national currency. The hard work and serious lifestyle of all the troupe members were praised by overseas Chinese everywhere. Unfortunately, Zhao Xun (i.e., Jin Shan), the head of the troupe, suddenly received a notice from the local government in November of last year, ordering him to leave the country by the end of December. In order to comply with local laws, Mr. Zhao left Singapore and returned to China on December 28. The troupe members originally planned to continue working in Perak and other places, but due to Zhao's return, the work lacked leadership, and the troupe had been abroad for more than a year and a half, far exceeding the scheduled date. Given the current environment, they were unable to fulfill their wishes and found it necessary to return to China temporarily for reorganization. Therefore, after careful consideration by the South Seas General Association and the troupe's responsible persons, it was officially announced on January 12 that the troupe's work in Malaya would be temporarily concluded, and all troupe members would return to China in batches at the end of February.

### British Prime Minister Churchill's Life on a Ship

— Ying Dai

Since the outbreak of the European War, the current British Prime Minister, Churchill, once lived on a warship for fourteen hours a day, commanding everything. On the ship, his private room had only one door, but due to the heavy burden of war, this door was rarely closed. At the end of the corridor, what distinguished it from the offices of ordinary officers was the sign indicating the office of the Admiral.

Even his private life has many stories to tell. For example, his dining room was like the warrant officers' mess on a flagship, with the table full of senior officers and other important personnel discussing war issues with Churchill. The private rooms of Churchill and his wife were surrounded by the warrant officers' mess, so that if there were important issues, warrant officers could be summoned for discussion at any time, day or night.

He lived on a warship and, due to the burden of affairs, did not have enough time to sleep, sleeping only four hours a day, or at most five hours. He got up before seven o'clock in the morning and read the newspaper first. This was his normal work, without interruption every day. He had to read every British newspaper, paying attention not only to political criticism, but also to the development of various industries. At half-past eight, his stenographer walked into his office and began to deal with official documents and letters. From half-past eleven to half-past one, a meeting was held every day, and he and his subordinates discussed all war issues.

Lunch was just a name, an opportunity for him to gather with politicians, naval experts, and the naval officers and soldiers under his command. In the afternoon, although the war was in progress, he would take an hour nap every day for health reasons. At that time, his reception room was full of people waiting to see him, presenting or reporting everything, such as the invention of new weapons, new tactical methods, and so on.

Churchill's real work on a warship was to direct the operational plans on the seven sea lanes every day, every hour, and every minute. Wireless telegrams and wireless broadcasts were constantly sent to the office, like blood circulating, and everything seemed to be alive. Sometimes, Churchill had a notebook next to him when he was eating, and if something important happened, he would write it down immediately, even without having time to eat. It was also common for an important message to wake him up from his sleep. From this, we can easily see how busy Churchill's life on a ship was, with almost no free time!

Shanghai is a prosperous city, and many fresh events occur every year, causing a sensation in society. The "Hero Brand Fine Wool Knitting Competition" held at the New World Company a few days ago can be said to be a fairly sensational and fresh event.

This conference was initiated by Anle Textile Factory, the producer of Hero Brand wool. The slogan of the conference was "Promote the virtues of diligence and frugality among women and enhance knitting skills." Judging from the enthusiasm of the participants and the excellence of the knitting skills, it did indeed yield rich harvests.

January 23 was the last day of the session and the date of the awards ceremony. Although it was raining lightly, the New World Company was crowded with people. Groups of men and women were admiring the beautiful achievements with ardent hope. They were infinitely excited to see the endless variety of knitting products, each with a smile on their face, expressing great optimism for the future of the knitting industry. The author also visited the venue for a week. The types of competition products included women's long coats, short coats, men's vests, children's clothing, and several other types. The styles were all different, and the patterns and color schemes were even more unique and beautiful. Several coats were knitted into the appearance of fur and tweed. At first glance, one almost thought they were real leather coats and tweed coats. "Clothing" is one of the four essential elements of human survival. If the "Wool Knitting Competition" can be held continuously, so that knitting technology constantly has new discoveries and achievements, and can satisfactorily solve a part of the "clothing" problem, it may not be a blessing for people's livelihood. Especially in our country with import surpluses, if we can use domestic wool knitting products to replace imported tweed and fur as much as possible, then it will not only benefit people's livelihood, but also be beneficial to the national economy. That's what I thought at the time.

The bell rang three times, and the award ceremony began. First, Manager Deng of Anle Factory gave a speech. Mr. Deng is one of the leading industrialists in China. He is at the prime of his life and has a graceful demeanor, obviously a resourceful and skilled figure. He earnestly talked about the motivation and hope for holding this conference, and also announced that the second conference would be held again within this year, and hoped that it would be held year after year, so that knitting technology would continue to improve, and the people of the country would have a more beautiful enjoyment in the "clothing" aspect. After the speech, the winners began to receive awards amidst thunderous applause. The first to fifth place winners each received bonuses of up to 500 yuan and large silver tripods of glory, and the sixth to tenth place winners each received generous bonuses and prizes. The award ceremony ended in a simple and solemn ceremony. The radio broadcast a melodious farewell music, and a large group of visitors walked out of the venue with brisk steps. I knew that a beautiful impression would be forever deeply imprinted in their minds.

### Walking as a Means of Transportation

— Zili

Whether I am going to work in the morning or returning home in the evening, the means of transportation I adopt has always been walking instead of taking a car. Therefore, in recent years, my two legs, which can be said to be universally useful and suitable for both long and short distances, have become my most economical, most convenient, and most satisfactory personal vehicle.

I remember that when I first started doing this, I inevitably felt a little unaccustomed, but now that I have mastered it and it has become a daily routine, I not only don't find it annoying, but I also consider walking a great pleasure. The effects it produces on my spirit and physical strength are not something that other people who walk less can appreciate.

Regardless of whether the price of trams or buses goes up or down, I don't take them anyway, and I don't spend a penny. I save a considerable amount of money on transportation and practice the virtue of thrift. Therefore, the pleasure I feel in my spirit is also unlimited. At the same time, in order to walk to work every day and arrive at my destination on time, I have to get up early to prepare so that I can leave as soon as possible. Therefore, getting up early has also become a habit unconsciously. Whenever the morning rises and the curtain is lifted, at the energetic moment of the morning, I take light steps and move forward bravely. Who knows that the best physical training is also unknowingly carried out and effective in this kind of walking?

In summary, the spiritual effect that walking gives me is like that, and the physical exercise is also like this. If we are to advocate frugality and the cultivation of a hardworking body and mind, walking is indeed a commendable and excellent method. May I ask modern young people, why not walk instead of taking a car? The second of the problem of cold living by Ni Changmin

### Ten Things Suitable for Living at Home

— Zheng Yimei

1.  Bamboo: Bamboo is one of the three friends of winter. Whether it is sunny, rainy, or dewy, it has its own wonderful charm. Planting it in the garden, shading the rafters, is a clear green, making people feel far away. Xue Yeye said, "People's houses must have three parts water, two parts bamboo, and one part house to be good." This is true.
2.  Banana: "Chongqing banana, every family plants it in the courtyard," see Longshu Yiyun. Once Ren Sinong built a banana forest study, and wrote a self-inscription: "Half a boat sitting in the rain is cold and desolate, as if the river and sky are playing in the evening tide. People are as clear as water in the west window, and the most pleasant place to listen to is the banana." Therefore, banana can be regarded as a clear companion. As for dripping broken sorrow, it is because people's situation cannot be well consoled, and if you blame the banana, the banana does not bear its responsibility.
3.  Paulownia: "A branch of green jade, a thousand leaves of green clouds," this is Bai Juyi's poem about the lone Paulownia in Yunju Temple; and it stands tall and straight, suitable for the summer courtyard. You can take its clear shade, play the zither and wash the inkstone, talk about ghosts and discuss Zen. What is more joyful than relieving summer heat and worries?
4.  Calligraphy and Painting: A building of calligraphy and painting, half a couch of tea smoke, this kind of clear blessing should be enjoyed. The paintings are best with small flower and landscape paintings, and the calligraphy is still good at the Jin and Tang people's witty words, and the solemn appearance is all rejected.
5.  Qin and Sword: Qin is for pleasure, and sword is for courage. Only old is precious, then the antique color, the eye of the brave, is also an excellent embellishment.
6.  Incense Burner: An incense burner of Xuande is offered on the desk, the patterns are clear, burning agarwood incense, strands of green seal script, heavy curtains protect it, it is quiet and incomparable, and can be used for a long day.
7.  Strange Stone: A strange stone the size of a fist has the artistic conception of Huang Zihua's paintings, matched with a sandalwood frame, placed on the desk, and imagine thousands of hills and valleys, and the mind is open.
8.  Ornamental Fish: Several ornamental fish are kept in a crystal pot, with green algae and red scales, swimming happily. Although they are confined to a small room, they seem to be on the Hao Pu, listening to Zhuangzi and Hui Shi's words.
9.  Green Parrot: Parrot is a wise bird, able to play its tongue and call guests, chanting the Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra, and getting this good in a quiet boudoir.
10. Kitten: Jade chess game is free to flip, gauze curtains are tightly stored. The beautiful story of the kitten has long been recorded in the pen of the former sage. And its nature is docile, and it is touching to caress between the curtains, and it not only has the function of subduing rats and protecting things.

### One Week's Family Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

I remember that squid seems to have never appeared on my menu, because it has some unknown origins. In fact, we also produce this thing in Guangdong, but the meat is older and the color is yellower. This kind of Guangdong squid is still a bit expensive, one yuan can buy five. After buying it, soak it in cold water overnight and it will soften. The time should not be too long, too long and it will lose its freshness. As for the method of cooking, it can be cut into small pieces and fried with meat slices and bean sprouts, or cut into shreds and fried with shredded meat and chives. If you like to eat soup, then you can add vermicelli in white soup, and then put in squid and shredded ham.

Spring and Autumn

### The Disconnection between "Recruitment" and "Seeking" - One Aspect of Labor-Management Conflict

— Yuchi Guang

Let's just say that Shanghai is developing in a distorted way, that Shanghai's industry and commerce are prospering in a distorted way, but it is strange enough to make us wonder that the overflowing tide of unemployment in the same region is still as panicked as before!

Some time ago, I read in the newspaper that the post office was recruiting a dozen or so postal workers to serve in the interior, but the number of applicants reached more than 1,000; and although the qualifications were limited to junior high school or primary school, many of the applicants had academic qualifications above the junior high school level. A few days ago, in a friend's company, in order to recruit several salespeople, more than 100 people applied; and once again, in the writing room next to us, it is said that only an advertisement for adding trainees was published in the newspaper for one day, and more than 80 people came to apply in one day. This clearly tells you that at this time and in this place, those who are eager for job opportunities (including job seekers and the unemployed) are as numerous as this!

But on the other hand, one cannot help but feel that there are even more miracles in front of one's eyes: in many factories, commercial firms, or companies, today there are cases of rule-breaking and desertion, tomorrow there are incidents of sinking into an irredeemable black hole until suicide, or even the day after tomorrow a murder case of smuggling goods is discovered, etc. Therefore, some places show a shortage of manpower, resulting in no way to develop business; and some places only raise a group of incompetent and uneven staff... Let's take the most common situation, when we occasionally visit some relatives and friends, three out of four families are shouting about the unfaithfulness of the housemaids and the lack of human feelings, etc. Today one is dismissed, and another new one is hired, and maybe another new one will be replaced tomorrow, but looking back at some head shops, you can only see the housemaids of the Ning Shao and other gangs sitting closely packed and waiting to be hired!

In our chats, we can find more examples of this situation, such as reading countless advertisements for employment or self-introduction in some social service columns, but in other pages, such as the classified advertisement columns, we can find countless advertisements for recruitment or employment. Trainees, salesmen, service personnel, old stewards, female workers, interns,... all kinds of personnel, really everything is needed...

Isn't this a very strange contradictory phenomenon! The disconnection between "recruitment" and "seeking"!

Among them, I feel that the lack of connection between "learning" and "application" in our country's education system is one reason. Naturally, the "hand system" and "yellow horse coat system" in this social system are produced. Isn't this also a causative factor? Faced with this contradictory phenomenon, this is a question that should be asked: "How to eliminate this contradictory phenomenon?"

### Automobiles and the Automobile Class

— Zhong Zimang

"1940 Sedans are already sold out." "XXX automobiles are few in number, buy them quickly." "XX Old Brand six-cylinder new cars are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai next month, viewings are welcome."

These are iron strikes in automobile advertisements in newspapers. Sometimes, we can see this kind of non-startling but eye-catching artistic large lettering in the exquisite window display of the automobile business.

Look, how beautiful these automobiles are displayed! Sprayed with azure crystal, with green-edged lower panels, the inside is a pearl-colored, elastic sofa, with eggplant-shaped small electric lights on top, and even a radio can be placed there. This is comfortable - like a luxurious and quiet café.

The automobile was probably handled by "window design experts," so it looks very appropriate and has "cinematic" scenery added! The trees and snow, as well as the hundreds of electric lights shining on it, this new automobile lying on the waxed, smooth floor can certainly look down upon the poor people outside the display window, homeless, wandering, and shivering.

It is not a big deal for Chinese people to have two or three automobiles each. Now, the newly emerging automobile class is quite numerous. Speculators, wanting to flaunt their wealth, first equip themselves with one. The newly emerging "important people" also equip themselves with one. Wealthy people of the first rank giving a small automobile as a gift to a famous socialite is even more common. Some people who often go out for social engagements have to rent a car by the month... Therefore, the sales of automobiles are quite good.

But the automobile space is a very expensive "animal" - the automobile itself is a valuable object, costing nearly ten thousand to acquire, and it also requires a chauffeur, and gasoline by the gallon. However, the poor people don't have to think about it that way. Look at the expenditures of the automobile class:

A chauffeur costs only a few dozen yuan per month. The automobile license fee must be paid every quarter.

What about gasoline? There is no real daily consumption, and it is always a muddled account.

The uses of the automobile: "Office," taking young masters and young ladies to school, the wife going shopping - these should be "legitimate matters."

The rest is for joyriding, going to and from dance halls, gambling dens, pelota courts, dog racing tracks, cinemas, restaurants, and hotels! Therefore, it embellishes the prosperity of these consumption venues, adding some splendor to those "fully booked" promotional photos!

The automobile class is willing to undertake these services, but when poor children open the car door to beg for money, they ignore them completely, sincerely instructing the chauffeur to speed away.

### Climbing

— Juehui

Everyone wants to climb, everyone has to climb, everyone is climbing.

Climb well, ascend to high office; climb poorly, fall and break your head!

But climb you must, fall you must, yet no one has ever been willing to "know when to stop." The best is to climb upwards and be level with the sky...

How can one climb up to the sky? This does not need to be considered; anyway, as long as one lives, one must climb every day. Not climbing is for "fools"!

And in the process of climbing, one must also squeeze, push, kick, and shout... One less person is of great benefit to oneself; so, in addition to climbing, one must also display one's skills in excluding others.

"Turmoil" is an excellent opportunity for climbing. Moreover, climbing does not require hands and feet, just take the "elevator" and rush to the sky, hanging in mid-air, neither human nor ghost, but the space is "triumphant," one's original form is not important!

But fortunately, there are still precedents of falling and breaking one's head...

The automobile class is often obediently greeted by the god of wealth, moving their bodies from one private car to another strange-smelling car. This kind of taste is also specially prepared for the countrymen who have automobiles.

Automobiles are probably the enemies of pedestrians. The tiger's mouth formed by strings of large reptiles allows those leisurely people to quickly get to entertainment venues, while pedestrians rushing to important matters are always waiting and waiting, nervously crossing the street, and a horn behind them will make them jump.

Once, an automobile ran over a beggar to death. The car owner just said a few words to the police, as if signing some kind of paper, and then drove away.

Every time, the injured or dead who are run over by automobiles are injured or dead, but the automobile is still alive. It is still alive by being filled with Scony or Shell.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Principal Hou looked out from a pair of old glasses and recognized the tall figure walking at the front, who was relatively thin and had a face full of the aura of opium, as Military Governor Hu. She immediately put on an unprecedented smile and went up to greet him. Unfortunately, her back was already severely hunched. Now, seeing this great personage, in order to show humility, she arched her back and shrugged her shoulders even more, bending into the shape of a "human shrimp." Military Governor Hu's body was at least three feet taller than hers, so no matter what, he could no longer see her smiling face.

"Principal Hou, let me introduce a friend to you," Military Governor Hu said in a full Shandong accent, "This is my sworn brother, Zhenshoushi Yuan Bin of Rehe. You probably can't have not heard of his name, right?"

"Very welcome, please give us as much guidance as possible!" Principal Hou said as she walked, but she dared not raise her head to admire this uninvited guest. It was not until the meeting was halfway through, just as Provincial Governor Wang was following Military Governor Hu on the stage, talking about the three obediences and four virtues, that she calmed her mind and glanced at the many distinguished guests in the audience, knowing that the military officer sitting on Military Governor Hu's right, who had a fat head and big ears, and whose height was five or six times greater than her own, was the so-called Zhenshoushi Yuan - a typical warlord.

Yuan Bin had come from Rehe this time specifically to accompany Military Governor Hu to Tianjin for the sake of Military Governor Hu marrying a daughter-in-law. On this day, he heard Military Governor Hu mention that he was going to the Provincial Women's Normal School to attend a commemorative meeting, which aroused his interest. He felt that taking this opportunity to see the female students there was a very good opportunity, so he came with Military Governor Hu.

For several years, all that Yuan Bin had seen were prostitutes, concubines, actresses, and other kinds of women who sold their souls. He had never even thought of seeing such dignified and pure female students. At this moment, sitting in front of three or four hundred female students, although there was no scent of powder blowing into his nose, and no charming laughter entering his ears, in his inspiration, there was a kind of indescribable interest and comfort that made him involuntarily look on in a daze.
