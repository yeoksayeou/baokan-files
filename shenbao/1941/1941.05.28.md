### British Royal Navy Displays Power: German Battleship Bismarck Sunk; Pursued Hundreds of Miles in 72 Hours; Hit by Six Aerial Torpedoes, Sharing the Hood's Fate

London - It was officially announced here this morning that the German's newest and most powerful battleship, the "Bismarck" (30,000 tons), has been sunk. The reason for the ship's deployment at sea remains unknown. However, given that the ship was Germany's most modern and powerful warship, it is doubtful that it was intended for a small-scale operation. This morning, the Prime Minister first announced the startling news of the British Navy's recent victory, followed by a formal announcement from the Admiralty: The German battleship "Bismarck" has been sunk by our forces. Details of the battle will be announced soon. Previously, the "New York Journal" had published a German-controlled Oslo radio message stating that a large-scale naval battle had occurred near Denmark, in which the German fleet, including the "Bismarck," had clashed with a superior British fleet. The British Admiralty announced last night that British naval aviation bombers had hit the "Bismarck" with bombs yesterday. On Saturday morning, the two sides clashed off Greenland, and British ships fiercely pursued the German ship. The British battlecruiser "Hood" (42,000 tons) exploded and sank at that time.

London - A special naval communiqué stated that after the British battlecruiser Hood sank in the Atlantic naval battle on Saturday, British forces pursued the 30,000-ton German battleship Bismarck.

It is reported that after the encounter between the Central German warship and foreign counterparts off Greenland on Saturday, the British Navy has been pursuing it for seventy-two hours, covering a distance of over hundreds of miles and still maintaining contact with the enemy ship. (Reuters, 27th)

### Detailed Account of the Naval Battle

London - It was announced here today that the German 30,000-ton battleship "Bismarck" has been sunk. The announcement was first made by the Prime Minister this morning, followed by confirmation from the Admiralty. Later, the German official news agency acknowledged the loss of this newest German battleship. The Germans always believed that the "Bismarck" could not be sunk. Since Saturday morning, when the British 42,100-ton battlecruiser "Hood" was sunk in battle near Greenland, British warships and naval aviation aircraft have relentlessly pursued the German ship. The details of the battle are still unknown, but it is understood that the British ships involved in the battle included the newly built "Prince of Wales" (35,000 tons) and the aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" (22,000 tons). It is reported that one of the carrier's aircraft hit the German ship with a torpedo. The German battleship "Bismarck" and the newly built German eight-inch-caliber cruiser "Prinz Eugen" were discovered by British aerial reconnaissance aircraft near Bergen, Norway, last Wednesday. On Thursday, they were observed leaving the area simultaneously. The British side immediately prepared to intercept them when they attempted to attack the Central's Atlantic convoy. On Friday night, the British side again detected them. At dawn on Saturday, the British ships "Prince of Wales" and "Hood" intercepted them at sea. The "Hood" was sunk at this time. The weather was poor, allowing the "Bismarck" to evade the British ships. Yesterday morning, the German ship was again spotted by American-made aircraft of the Naval Aviation Corps, heading towards the French coast. Yesterday afternoon, torpedo-carrying aircraft from the "Ark Royal" repeatedly attacked the isolated "Bismarck," hitting the ship with six aerial torpedoes, rendering it unable to maneuver. After daybreak today, the pursuing British warships opened fire. There is no news regarding the fate of the cruiser "Prinz Eugen." (Reuters, 27th)

London - First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander gave a speech at a luncheon in London today, stating that the German battleship "Bismarck" sank at 11:00 AM today.

Last night at 11:42 PM, the German Naval Command received a message from Fleet Commander Admiral Lütjens stating, "The 'Bismarck' is no longer able to maneuver as desired. We will fight to the last bullet. Hail the Führer!" The ship fought until this morning before sinking. (Haitong Dispatch, 27th)

The Soviet Union is sparing no effort to strengthen its naval power, so that the enemy is awestruck. The Soviet Navy is now determined to deliver a lightning and devastating blow to the enemy. The heroic deeds of the Russian Navy have not been forgotten. The Soviet people are very fond of their navy, and Soviet youth are eager to serve in the navy. Soviet naval personnel will greet this year's Navy Day with new achievements in training and express their readiness to move at any time under wise leadership with their formidable technology and power to defend our beloved homeland."

Syria's Capital - Official circles here have announced that only twenty regular army cavalrymen and twenty-one militiamen followed Lieutenant Colonel Collet to join the British forces outside the city. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)

Swedish Capital - An editorial in "Dagens Nyheter" discussed the Japanese military mission to Europe, saying that since the establishment of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, the only important remarks from the authorities have been Foreign Minister Matsuoka's comments, which are absolutely not far-fetched. The Tripartite Pact was originally intended to threaten the United States not to join the war, but the United States was not frightened by it. It should be known that today's international treaties have absolutely no value, but are only used to stir up public opinion and have nothing to do with government actions. If Japan believes that the United States can be attacked, it will attack it, not because of the Tripartite Pact. The German-Italian military alliance and the Soviet-German agreement, the US-Turkish agreement all have all sorts of different histories. France's promise to England was broken without discussion. This is enough to show that the United States does not need to fear the Tripartite Pact. Furthermore, Japan has already learned a lesson and knows that it is difficult to get off the tiger's back. China, after four years of war, still cannot be defeated. Although a Chinese quisling government has been established, it has had absolutely no effect. Japan's resources have now reached an extreme state of depletion. If the United States imposes a blockade on it, it will be driven into a desperate situation. Therefore, the reason why the United States disregards the threats of the Tripartite Pact is conceivable, and it is not unreasonable that the Axis newspapers have been indifferent to the Japanese military mission to Europe.

Australian Prime Minister Calls On National Unity to Deal with the Current Crisis

Sydney - After returning here from Europe and the United States, Australian Prime Minister Menzies yesterday issued an appeal for the Australian people to unite politically, saying that whether he remains the leader of the government or not is not his concern, but whoever the leader may be, the people must give them consistent support in action and spirit. He hopes that his personal friendship with Labour Party leader Curtin can serve as a symbol of the most united cooperation between the parties. Parliament must be a tool of expression and debate, and not a place for infighting. After witnessing astonishing unity in England, he is now shocked to see that Labour representatives in the Australian War Council still have no executive power. We must now cooperate across party lines to deal with the greatest difficulty in our history. If the machinery is turned around at this time, it will cause us to be forever lost. Menzies continued to speak about the United States, saying, "I trust President Roosevelt, but in the next six months we must rely on ourselves. Australia must greatly increase its production of war materials and abolish unnecessary production and consumption." (Reuters, 27th)

Japan Seizes American Goods in Vietnam: Raw Materials Purchased by China, Including Gasoline, Machinery, etc.

Manila - The manager of the American Far East Trading Company, Hyde, told a United Press reporter yesterday that the American goods seized by the Japanese army in Haiphong on Sunday were mostly raw materials ordered by China using American loans. Hyde is now in Manila en route to the United States for a vacation and will return to the company's head office in Vietnam. He said that the items confiscated by the Japanese army included metals, gasoline, and machinery. These goods had been stacked in warehouses for a year, during which time the company waited for permission to be transported. Last September, the Japanese allowed them to transport $1 million worth of goods out of Haiphong, but no more. Hyde also said that the American consul in Hanoi had repeatedly attempted to request permission from the French and Japanese authorities to transport the remaining $10 million worth of goods, but without success.

### Speech by the Prime Minister of Southern Ireland: Opposing Forced Conscription in Northern Ireland; North and South Ireland Still Harbouring the Hidden Pain of Separation; Believing This Action Damages the Basic Rights of the Irish People

Dublin - Southern Ireland Prime Minister de Valera spoke in the Irish Parliament yesterday afternoon on the issue of forced conscription in Northern Ireland, saying that nothing undermines basic rights more than forcing a country to send troops to fight for a country to which it does not wish to belong. When the British government proposed conscription in Northern Ireland, he had negotiated with London in opposition. The six counties of Northern Ireland are part of Ireland, and their residents are Irish people. This is an unchangeable fact. Regardless of what political or economic changes occur in the world, the people living on this island will eventually live together as neighbors. We do not consider any actions that might appear to be hostile towards Britain to be justifiable. If the Central Government comes to implement this conscription proposal, the people of these two islands will once again fall into the unhappy relations of the past. Ireland has declared neutrality. This is friendly neutrality, meaning that Ireland will never allow its territory to be used by an enemy as a base for attacking Britain. All of Ireland's troops are the guarantee that this promise will be fulfilled. De Valera spoke of the separation of North and South Ireland, saying that some years ago, Britain and Ireland reached a solution that was approved by the British Parliament, resolving various outstanding issues. The most important of these was the issue of separation. He initially believed that once good relations were established, separation could soon be eliminated. Unfortunately, war has broken out while everyone in Ireland still harbors the hidden pain of separation. Southern Ireland opposition leader Cosgrave stated that misunderstandings between Ireland must not arise at this time, causing old hatreds that everyone in this parliament hopes to eliminate forever to be rekindled. The situation in the current war is extremely dangerous. If it is not handled well, it will involve the survival of this country, and not only the future happiness of this country. The adverse reaction of forced conscription is difficult to predict, but it will undoubtedly be very great. He knows that the results in both North and South Ireland, and elsewhere, will be more harmful than beneficial to the country. However, we should ask ourselves whether the steps we are now taking are the most effective in preventing conscription in Northern Ireland and ensuring a future that is acceptable to the people of both North and South Ireland. Southern Ireland Labor Party leader Norton supported the protest against forced conscription. During the discussion, U.S. representative Maffett and the Canadian chargé d'affaires in Ireland, Gallander, were present as observers. (Reuters, 27th)

Editorial

### The Battle of Crete and the International Situation

Germany has recently failed to break through Turkey and into Iraq to join forces southward, and instead has been forced to concentrate its efforts on a lightning air strike on Crete. The threat this poses to the British Eastern Mediterranean is relatively minor compared to an offensive through Turkey. This is the first point worth noting in the current international situation. Secondly, since the start of the Battle of Crete, Britain has had a considerable opportunity and breathing space to repel German forces in Iraq, achieving a political victory in general, temporarily stabilizing the Near East, preserving the oil fields, and guaranteeing the main supply of oil for its fleets in the Mediterranean and Red Seas. This is also worth noting. The third and most important point is that it proves that the previous rumors of a Soviet-German compromise and tacit understanding regarding the Near East were completely inaccurate. As a result, the situation of victory or defeat in the Anglo-German struggle for hegemony in the Near East has not yet reached a point where it is difficult to reverse or remedy. This situation has a very significant impact on the entire international future.

According to general observations at present, Germany's lightning strike on Crete contains a rehearsal for an attack on the British Isles. Further examination of the lessons learned in the past few days may cause Hitler to hesitate temporarily and delay his final assault on the British Isles. Of course, on the side of the British and Greek allied forces defending Crete, the intensity of this offensive and the magnitude of the losses are undeniable. However, on the German side, this kind of concentrated hammering that does not hesitate to make any sacrifices has not been able to achieve decisive results in a very short period of three or two days, which is already a great disappointment. Moreover, in terms of material resources, the degree of concentration and sacrifice has even forced it to temporarily suspend its air raids on Britain in recent days. And the massive sacrifice of personnel is simply approaching a group suicide strategy. The two sides stimulate and hold each other, evolving into a situation where neither side has any room for retreat. Although it is still too early to predict the victory or defeat of the Battle of Crete, at least one thing can be asserted: even if the attacker eventually wins, the price paid in both personnel and material terms is bound to be many times greater than that of Britain and Greece. It is doubtful how long Germany's resources will allow it to continue this kind of frantic warfare once it is used against the British Isles. And how long the German people will allow the Nazis to carry out this frantic action of wasting the lives of their own people is also a major question.

Analyzing the entire international situation, Germany's all-out gamble on Crete does not indicate an unprecedented increase in its power or absolute confidence in its winning advantage. On the contrary, it reveals Hitler's unprecedented anxiety. On the one hand, the demand for and pressure on Turkey to allow passage has not achieved its purpose due to the attitudes of the Soviet Union and Turkey. At the same time, what frightens Germany the most is that American aid to Britain is becoming increasingly concrete and is playing a decisive role in the outcome of the war.

To counter this with all resources, the entire resources under the control of German and Italian forces in Europe, excluding the Soviet Union and the British Isles, as well as one or two small countries in Northern Europe, are inherently inferior to the United States, Canada, and most of South and Central America under British and American control. Moreover, the entire resources of the British colonies must be added to this. Britain and the United States, cooperating with each other in naval matters, almost control all the seas of the world, allowing vast material resources to flow continuously to Britain, build up its war machine, and gradually launch a fierce competition in armaments with Germany and Italy. On the other hand, the United States is actively training combat personnel, and Britain is accelerating the recruitment of personnel from its colonies, in order to wait for an opportunity to give Germany and Italy a fatal blow. Therefore, solely in terms of current combat strength, Germany and Italy do indeed hold a considerable air superiority and overwhelming land advantage over Britain, causing the latter to constantly fear that Germany and Italy will invade the British Isles by airlifting troops, or cross the narrower seas through the Near East or Spain and invade Africa. However, if Germany and Italy fail to achieve a decisive victory during this fleeting favorable period, what is about to be confirmed is the common precarious situation of Germany and Italy themselves. It has been almost a year since the fall of France last year, and Germany and Italy have still failed to immediately launch a large-scale invasion of the British Isles. Whether this is due to the impossibility of the balance of power or to strategic necessity or failure, let us put it aside for the time being. However, this is Germany and Italy's greatest failure, and it cannot be denied. As of now, if Germany and Italy launch another direct war against the British mainland, the possibility of its success is certainly not as good as last year. But in any case, this is still the only way to attempt to defeat Britain. Indeed, the only course of action currently available to Germany and Italy is to gradually dismantle Britain, while simultaneously threatening and enticing the Soviet Union and Turkey in the hope of achieving a compromise and cooperation, and waging a long-term war with Britain and the United States.

In short, the crisis in Britain's current combat strength is forcing it to appeal to the United States for larger-scale practical assistance. And the weaknesses of Germany and Italy in the future, which will be difficult to sustain, have indeed reached a point where they must strive to forge a bloody path. The attitude of the United States to aid Britain is certainly not in question. What is now worth pointing out is that if the positions of the Soviet Union and Turkey remain strong throughout, then the failure of Germany and Italy is probably only a matter of time. Conversely, even if the Soviet Union and Turkey further cooperate with Germany and Italy, and the United States also enters the war, then the world's war disaster will probably increase countless times.

### Encountering a Severe Crisis in History: America Will Make an Important Announcement; All Parties are Waiting Quietly for Roosevelt's Speech; It is Expected that America Will Fully Assist China and Britain

Chongqing. All of China is extremely concerned about President Roosevelt's fireside chat today. International Broadcasting Station plans to receive this broadcast. It can be received at 9:30 AM tomorrow morning, and then translated into Chinese and broadcast to the whole country. The National Diplomacy Association also plans to receive this speech and has invited Chinese and foreign journalists to attend and listen. This morning, Chinese newspapers reported that in view of the affirmative comments made by American Ambassador Gauss yesterday, Roosevelt's speech may mention the Far East, that is, declare that the United States will continue to help China fight for freedom and independence. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Washington. Mr. Simms, a well-known commentator for "Scripps Howard" newspapers, wrote here yesterday that Washington is waiting for President Roosevelt's speech on Tuesday evening with a tension not seen since 1917. He said, "President Roosevelt's fireside chat to be delivered on Tuesday evening is the most notable one in Washington's distant memory, not only here but also abroad. According to diplomats, the tense unease is even greater than in 1917, when President Wilson officially announced, 'If Germany sinks American ships, war will ensue.'" Simms also said, "Now someone tells Washington that unless the United States makes the Atlantic passable, Britain is beyond salvation. Unless the United States patrols the South Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and Red Sea, the American supply lines related to Britain's survival are in danger of being cut off. Unless the United States occupies the French port of Dakar, the Nazi Party will invade the Americas. Unless we occupy the Azores, the Canary Islands, and the Cape Verde Islands, the Germans will occupy them. The same is true for Guadeloupe and Martinique. Britain is threatened, as is Greenland. Ireland is resentful of the United States for the few ships carrying food to Ireland due to famine." Simms continued to review the situation in the Far East. He said, "Everyone says that if the United States wants to make the Atlantic suitable for British ships to navigate, it must transfer part of the Pacific Fleet elsewhere, which will make the war more likely to spread to the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies. So what does President Roosevelt think? What will he do? Will he provide escorts, declare a worldwide emergency, provide military assistance to China and Britain, or even include participation in the war if necessary? This is what every diplomat here is eager to ask." (United Press dispatch, 27th)

New York. Republican leader Wilkie requested last night that President Roosevelt, in his fireside chat to be delivered tonight, tell "the leaders of all totalitarian countries that the United States intends to work hard to curb aggressive countries and totalitarian countries." Wilkie was speaking at a "United Aid to China" parade in New York. He mentioned the sinking of the world's largest battleship, the "Hood," saying it shows the seriousness of the current crisis. Wilkie declared, "I believe that any American people who hear this message (the sinking of the Hood) will recognize that the United States is encountering the greatest crisis in its history." (United Press dispatch, 27th)

London. Britain awaits President Roosevelt's fireside chat tonight with confidence, hoping that President Roosevelt will announce his second step to fully assist Britain without participating in the war. Officials refused to predict the content of President Roosevelt's speech, but non-official observers believe that the most important part of the speech will discuss the Battle of the Atlantic, especially because German Fleet Commander Raeder has warned that if the United States begins to escort military supplies to Britain, American ships will be attacked by Germany. The Daily Mail commented, "We can confidently expect that President Roosevelt will at least extend the Monroe Doctrine to half of the Atlantic and be prepared to protect freedom on the seas by force and protect freedom on the seas." (United Press dispatch, 27th)

### O'Leary Hints to Reporters: President's Speech is Important in Nature

Washington. President Roosevelt's private secretary, O'Leary, told reporters at the White House yesterday that the President is now revising his speech, which will be delivered on Tuesday, in view of the rapid changes in the overseas situation. According to the original plan, this speech was to be disclosed half a month ago. At that time, O'Leary advised reporters not to attach too much importance to it, but yesterday O'Leary said, "What I can tell you is that the President will spend all day today until night, and even tomorrow, revising his speech, in view of the rapid changes in the overseas situation. Don't question me, because I can't tell you the details. You will know the details when you hear his speech." When reporters mentioned that the German Foreign Ministry did not criticize the German Navy Commander Raeder's remarks about escorts, O'Leary claimed, "I think Berlin is doing what it can today to obscure the President's remarks, and in the time between today and tomorrow, deliberately making dangerous remarks to scare you. Therefore, before the President speaks, you may ask about other Berlin news, which is not surprising." The President is spending more time preparing his speech than O'Leary can remember. The President consulted many people when drafting the speech, including the playwright Sherwood. The President has also consulted Sherwood on other important military documents. The President's speech will be translated into at least six languages ​​and broadcast to various countries. O'Leary neither revealed the nature of this speech nor explained what events in international developments prompted him to warn reporters not to exaggerate. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Nazis Habitually Use Intimidation Tactics: Hull Says He Will Ignore Them

Washington. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday while receiving reporters that German Navy Commander Raeder's declaration (to the Japanese Domei News Agency) that "Germany will consider American escorts an act of war" is clearly a threat, intending to prevent the United States from truly devoting itself to national defense while Hitler has not yet obtained control of roads and other continents. Hitler has used the same tactics on European countries, and Raeder's remarks are just one part of the entire process of conquering the world by force. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Observers believe that Hull's remarks are particularly important because they generally refer to the countries of the Americas. Hull arrived late to see his guests, which was due to careful consideration of his remarks. Someone asked about the events in the Far East. Hull replied that he had not received any news about the reported confiscation of American goods in the Haiphong godowns by the Japanese, but the State Department was paying close attention to the matter and may have news to report to the press later. Someone also asked whether the Japanese Foreign Ministry had made a statement to the American Ambassador to Japan, Grew, regarding American aid to Britain. Hull said he had not heard of it. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

### Tokyo Authorities Deeply Concerned: Believe It Will Affect Japanese-American Relations

The "Hochi Shimbun" in Tokyo stated that the Japanese government is paying serious attention to President Roosevelt's future fireside chat, as President Roosevelt may decide on the attitude of the United States regarding participation in the European war, and "will have a major impact on future Japanese-American relations." When discussing this matter, the newspaper declared that "Japan's diplomatic policy is pursued in accordance with peace," and said that this can be seen in the conclusion of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact and the Vietnamese-Thai Peace Pact. The "Hochi Shimbun" stated that if the United States "is on the same side as Japan's just world policy and expresses sincere intentions to improve relations with Japan, the Tokyo government will be happy to do so." (United Press dispatch, 27th)

An editorial in the "Hochi Shimbun" in Tokyo approved of the warning issued by German Navy Commander Raeder to the United States on May 24 regarding escorts, saying that Germany's determination to use force against American Atlantic patrol measures, similar to wartime expansion, is justified for various reasons. President Roosevelt is now obviously hesitant and has not immediately implemented the escort method for transporting aid to Britain, which shows that Washington also knows that escorts will inevitably involve the United States in the vortex of the European war. The warning issued by Admiral Raeder can be said to be as important as the declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare issued by Germany during the last war. If the United States does not make a last-minute change of plan, the United States' opportunity to maintain neutrality in the Atlantic war will be lost, and this point has been made clear by Admiral Raeder. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also approved of Raeder's statement that the United States should be responsible for the German-American war, saying that the British military's repeated defeats from Greenland to Africa have gradually shown the final result of the European war and indicated that it is too late for the United States to participate in the war to save Britain from defeat. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### American Secretary of the Navy Asks Congress for Greater Power Over Ships

Washington. Secretary of the Navy Knox has asked Congress to approve legislation allowing commanders of warships to exercise greater power to properly protect their warships in American territorial waters. In a letter to House Speaker Rayburn, Knox said that Congress would give ship captains greater freedom of action. The proposed bill will allow the officers in charge of naval warships or coast guard ships cooperating with the navy to manage the actions or berthing of foreign or domestic ships in American territorial waters. Any ship that ignores the orders of the responsible naval officer will be severely punished. President Roosevelt signed an order yesterday approving the construction of 50 naval auxiliary ships. At the same time, the US Maritime Commission announced the signing of new contracts to build ships worth $240,000,000. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Washington. It is learned that one of the four members of the National Defense Committee, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, inspected the sea surface at the invitation of Admiral King, commander of the Atlantic Fleet. It is known that Morgenthau wanted to see the exercises of the naval patrol team. The Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to manage the US Coast Guard, and several Coast Guard ships have been dispatched to participate in naval patrol missions. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Washington. US Navy officials yesterday declined to comment on Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau's meeting at sea with the Atlantic Fleet. However, it is widely believed that Morgenthau was on the flagship. However, there has been no definite confirmation of the rumor that he negotiated the participation of the naval patrol team (under the Department of the Treasury) in the neutrality patrol under the auspices of the Department of the Treasury. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Japanese Government Spokesman Warns America Not to Tread into the Path of War

Tokyo. Ishii, a spokesman for the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau, recently warned the United States in a conversation with the press not to take lightly the statement made by German naval leader Raeder that Germany would consider it an act of war if the US escorted military supplies to Britain. He also said that if the United States ignores Raeder's statement, "I am afraid the United States will create a dangerous and extremely difficult situation." However, Ishii refused to comment on what Japan would do if the US escorted ships. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Tokyo. When asked about Britain's blacklisting of 92 Japanese ships, the spokesman replied that Tokyo was still unclear as to the purpose of this move and said that the government had not discussed taking retaliatory action. He also said that Japan, in principle, refuses to recognize the naval passport system, as this infringes on neutral rights. However, Japan is still cooperating with the British authorities, and various rumors are not credible. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Japan Absolutely Has No Remaining Strength to Wage War Against the US – Observations of a Senior Figure in the American Press –

New York – Duranty, a renowned figure in the press and a member of the North American Newspaper Alliance, recently sent an article from Honolulu after traveling in Japan. He stated that while Japan claims it wants to fulfill the promises of the Tripartite Pact, circumstances do not permit Japan to enter the war. However, he said he believes Japan will participate once oil supplies are cut off. Duranty stated that among Japan's key leaders, there is still considerable doubt as to whether joining the Axis is a sound strategy, but there are still some who firmly advocate joining the Axis, seeking to participate in plundering the British Empire and neutralizing the Soviet Union to reduce Soviet aid to China. Duranty also stated that the Japanese are very fearful and pessimistic about the escape of German Deputy Führer Hess. He also stated that if Japan is so disturbed by such a small matter, it may not be able to wage war against the United States, Britain, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies. Duranty also stated that, as a result of his travels in the Far East, he learned that foreign observers in the region believe that the economic, agricultural, financial, and even manpower exhaustion felt by Japan due to the war in China is more significant than it appears on the surface, and that the number of soldiers who die from illness is three to four times greater than the number who die in battle.

### Battle of Crete – British and Germans Still Deadlocked – Fierce Fighting Unfolds at Canea and Maleme – Greek Cabinet Ministers Still on the Island

Cairo – According to the latest news from the front lines, the battle of Crete is intensifying, especially in the suburbs of Maleme. The two armies are engaged in continuous attacks and counterattacks. It is reported that fierce fighting is taking place between Canea and Maleme, and around the Maleme airfield, with both sides gaining and losing ground. According to another report, German forces, assisted by reinforcements transported by air, and under the cover of heavy German bombing, have penetrated British positions. New Zealand forces immediately counterattacked. The German side disregards the heavy losses suffered by its troops, and its aircraft losses are also extremely heavy. It is now known that the ports of Heraklion and Rethymno and the airfields are still in British hands. Although there are reports of German troops nearby, the situation has not changed. It has been revealed that British Royal Marines are currently fighting alongside Allied forces. The Greek Embassy in London announced today that not all Greek cabinet ministers have left Crete with the King. The Ministers of Interior, Labor, and Land and Air Force remain on the island to handle military and civil affairs. Further details have emerged today regarding the King's evacuation from Crete. According to various reports, when hundreds of German paratroopers landed a short distance from the King's residence, the King and his party left their residence and moved towards the center of the island. At that time, the sky was filled with German aircraft, and the situation was very dangerous. Moreover, the weather was extremely hot, and the King and his party, wearing only light walking shoes, trekked for three days before leaving the dangerous area. British Ambassador Palairet and his staff also narrowly escaped disaster. Major General Heywood, the head of the British military mission to Greece, has returned here with the King. It is said that on May 20th, the first day of the German attack, he telephoned the King's residence in the morning, and the person who answered was German, indicating that the residence had already been occupied. In the afternoon, when British Ambassador Palairet and his wife and staff were sheltering in a trench, three shells landed near the embassy. The British Consul, Mr. Mitt, was buried under rubble but managed to free himself by using his hands and a copper flower pot to clear away the debris. According to captured German orders, the German side chose a location guarded by a Greek company where three thousand Italian prisoners were held, as the German paratrooper headquarters. Each paratrooper carried three times the weapons, intending to cause disruption. Unexpectedly, after the prisoners obtained weapons, they fought back against the German troops. Major General Heywood recounted that the British Ambassador and his staff departed in three cars at 3:30 AM to meet with the King, traveling over high mountains and finally reaching the coast. After meeting the King, they continued their journey, seeing over five hundred paratroopers landing. They then climbed over an 8,000-foot-high mountain, spending the night in a shepherd's stone hut on the summit. The climate was very cold. The King subsisted on sheep's milk and biscuits. After two days, they crossed the mountain. Their last meal, cooked by Mrs. Palairet, consisted only of eggs and military canned food. They waited quietly for a boat to pick them up at night. Soon they saw a signal from the sea, and an officer was first sent by a small boat to confirm that it was safe before boarding the ship to escape. Major General Heywood praised the New Zealand forces, the garrison in Crete, and the Greek army. The islanders have also organized self-defense forces, using various rifles to resist the enemy. (Reuters dispatch from the 27th)

### German Paratroopers Continue to Land in the Maleme Area – Numbers Are Extremely High

Cairo – Military sources here have recently summarized the latest developments, stating that the situation in Crete remains unchanged. In the past 24 hours, German troops have continued to land in the Maleme area and are engaged in fierce fighting with Allied forces in that area. It is difficult to predict how the battle will develop. It is also difficult to determine whether the number of German troops landing is greater than those landing in the previous two days. However, the enemy's aircraft losses must be heavy, and those that are not destroyed are in urgent need of inspection and repair. Yesterday, the British Air Force in the Middle East released a communiqué stating that British bombers and fighters launched a fierce attack on enemy positions and aircraft on Crete throughout Sunday and Saturday night, with outstanding results. At least 24 enemy aircraft of various types were destroyed, and several were damaged. The Maleme airfield and nearby fields, where German gliders and troop transport planes landed, were the main targets of the British aircraft. JU-52 transport planes concentrated in the area were hit and severely damaged. Two enemy transport planes that were landing and taxiing were also hit and caught fire. Several other enemy planes were shot down by British fighters and caught fire. British planes also shot down an enemy transport plane in Souda Bay. Photos taken during the attacks prove that the enemy's damage is very severe. (Reuters dispatch from the 27th)

Berlin – A Ha Tung News Agency reporter learned last night from responsible sources that German aircraft are continuing to carry paratroopers to Crete as reinforcements. German aircraft have gained air supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean, protecting the transport of troops and supplies to the island. According to returning pilots, British positions and ships are burning. (Ha Tung News Agency dispatch from the 27th)

### British Positions West of Canea Breached by Heavily Attacking German Forces

New York – British overseas troops on western Crete desperately defended yesterday against German forces brought in by air and sea. The Germans had tanks as support, and more reinforcements arrived continuously, landing on the coast. In the past six days, the German side has destroyed 24 British warships. According to a British military communiqué from Cairo, New Zealand troops counterattacked the innermost German defense lines at Canea and Souda Bay, but the results are unclear. German headquarters claimed that German forces had launched a general offensive from the Maleme airfield, and the battle was progressing smoothly. The German side also claimed that German forces were victorious everywhere else, presumably referring to Canea, Heraklion, Rethymno, and other locations. (United Press International dispatch from the 27th)

Cairo – A British headquarters communiqué announced that German paratroopers have broken through British positions west of Canea. New Zealand troops are engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat in a vigorous counterattack. German losses are very heavy. The situation of the battles at Heraklion and Rethymno remains unchanged. (United Press International dispatch from the 27th)

London – It is believed here today that the Germans have concentrated their aircraft to transport tanks weighing three to eight tons for a new attack to expand their occupied area in Crete from Maleme to Canea. In this area, the exhausted New Zealand troops are struggling to repel the large number of newly arrived attackers. At the end of last week, the German offensive seemed to have slackened, but on Monday, large numbers of paratroopers and troop transport planes landed, and the situation became tense again. The *Times* military correspondent believes that because the Germans cannot achieve a decisive victory with the three divisions of soldiers who have already landed, they have decided to send several more divisions to join the battle. As for the British side, unless the censors prohibit reporters from reporting on troop reinforcements, we have not heard of British troops adding a single soldier. We only know that Britain is still fighting with the British and Greek garrisons that fought against the first German troops a week ago, while the number of German soldiers is increasing daily. It is estimated that the Germans have sent 25,000 to 28,000 men to Crete, and the ability of the country's defenders to cope with the German supply of food and ammunition to the landed German troops, as well as the German troops who are on their way to reinforce, is uncertain. (United Press International dispatch from the 27th)

### Italian "Mosquito Boat" Squadron Escorts German Small Boats Transporting Supplies

Rome – All newspapers here are publishing news about the progress of the battle of Crete, both at sea and in the air, in large format. They especially emphasize the effective participation of the Italian navy and air force. When German troops use many small boats to transport reinforcements and supplies to the island, they are escorted by the Italian "Mosquito Boat" squadron. Although the firepower of this small fleet is small and enough to penetrate enemy ship armor, it can always launch torpedoes. (Havas dispatch from the 26th)

Berlin – German experts officially stated yesterday that the British navy's recent losses near Crete have effectively annihilated its Alexandria cruiser squadron. The battle of Crete proves once again that the power of the air force is superior to that of the navy. As in the Norwegian campaign, Britain was unable to exert its naval power because of the German air force. Today, the British navy is experiencing the same lesson in Crete. Even if British aircraft carriers have ideal air force bases, they have all fallen into German hands, so their effectiveness is also extremely weak. According to information received here, Alexandria currently has twelve British cruisers, and it is reported that reinforcements will be sent from the Far East and Gibraltar. (Ha Tung News Agency dispatch from the 27th)

Berlin – Responsible authorities announced last night that German aircraft attacked British brigades and camps on Crete yesterday. In the waters off Crete, German reconnaissance planes spotted a British heavy cruiser, burning from bow to stern. In addition, there was a destroyer and three merchant ships completely burned, all reduced to ashes. (Ha Tung News Agency dispatch from the 27th)

### French Air Minister Returns from the Near East – Delivers Broadcast to the Nation – Denounces Major Collet's Defection

Vichy – Air Minister General Bergeret, who recently visited Africa and Syria for inspection, has completed his official duties and returned here by plane this afternoon. He immediately delivered a broadcast speech to the nation, reporting on his trip and the impressions he gained. He said, "When I set out to inspect Africa on the 10th of this month, I heard of a major incident in Syria, so I went to Syria for inspection. Therefore, it was only now that I was able to return home. When I was in North Africa and Syria, I met with leaders from all sectors of the government and the people, and the impressions I gained were extremely pleasant. In all the places I visited, I was able to see the two major factors in the revival of France: unity and strict discipline. Not only were such expressions often made in newspapers, magazines, and public speeches, but they were also reflected in reality. As a result, my perception of Marshal Pétain personally and his work has been strengthened. I stayed in Syria for several days, and it happened that an officer (referring to Lieutenant Colonel Collet) attempted to lead his troops to defect to a foreign country, but his subordinates all understood the greater good, and after discovering this, they returned to their posts. One soldier once said, 'We can only serve under the French flag.' At a time when the outside world is spreading rumors, attempting to undermine French unity and military discipline, this soldier's words can truly serve as our motto." (Havas dispatch from the 26th)

Gliding Exercises to be Held Throughout the Soviet Union – Turkey Pays Attention to Air Defense

### Various Grain Merchants Start to Undertake Sales – Price of Tribute Rice Has Been Determined – Approximately 87 Yuan in National Currency Per Stone – Saigon Dispatches Will Be Supplied Monthly Going Forward

Guest Merchants Purchase Small Amount of Grain, Market Unexpectedly Starts to Rise

The procedure for the purchase of tribute rice directly from the Vietnamese government by the French Municipal Council was assigned to the import committee organized by Jardine Matheson and other foreign firms. There is also an export committee organization in Saigon to assist in the handling. According to a *Ping Ming She* reporter's inquiry, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Fukuka, and Hap Yee Foreign Firms in Shanghai received a telegram from Saigon yesterday morning saying that the rice being handled is a mixed broken rice of No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon varieties. The amount needed per month in Shanghai can be supplied monthly. Now that the Shanghai sales affairs have been negotiated, the tribute rice will be transported to Shanghai. The price at which it will be sold in the future has also been determined. It is reported that each bag weighs 220.46 pounds, and the price for wholesaling to various grain merchants is 96 yuan in national currency per bag. The price for various grain merchants to sell to various rice stores must not exceed 105.84 yuan per bag. The retail price for various rice stores must also not exceed 108 yuan per bag, which is about 87 yuan in national currency per stone. Judging from the price of flat-price rice handled by the two concessions, regardless of the quality of the rice purchased, the price of tribute rice handled by the French Municipal Council is cheaper.

Thai Run and Other Firms Order Tribute Rice – The firms handling the tribute rice are the import committees organized by Jardine Matheson and other firms. After the news of the Saigon telegram spread yesterday morning, various grain merchants in Shanghai inquired and were happy to undertake the sales. The first to order from Jardine Matheson and other firms were three grain merchants, including Thai Run, with a total amount of 1,500 tons (i.e., 15,000 bags). As for the specific measures for selling this tribute rice in the future, representatives from various grain merchants are currently discussing with the French Municipal Council. According to people in the rice industry, the sales affairs of this tribute rice are progressing smoothly, and the specific measures are expected to be formulated within days. According to what they know, these measures will be slightly different from those handled by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession.

Hong Kong Rice Sells Well, Distribution Restarted

A total of 151,309 bags of Hong Kong rice, including previous shipments, have arrived. However, the market has recently experienced another price surge, and most hoarders hoard goods and seek profits, deliberately raising market prices. Yesterday, the price surge was even more severe in the rice market. As a result, various retail rice stores in Shanghai also raised prices at the same time, and most ordinary citizens were unwilling to inquire, and bought the Shanghai Municipal Council's flat-price Hong Kong rice. Yesterday, because most retail rice stores had sold out of Hong Kong rice, the number of people who bought from the 17 grain merchants such as Thai Run was also quite large. Thai Run and other firms then applied to Cheung Mao Foreign Firm to order flat-price Hong Kong rice for resale to various rice stores. Cheung Mao Foreign Firm has reviewed the application and it is heard that two grain merchants are likely to be re-allocated 500 tons (i.e., 5,000 bags).

Weight Shortages, Refunds, Strictly Investigate Sales

Cheung Mao Foreign Firm will begin to refund weight shortages today. When rice stores go to collect refunds, they must stamp their store's chop on the back of their weight slip for it to be valid. If the weight exceeds 224 pounds, the rice store must also pay for the overweight rice. According to news from Lap Kee Foreign Firm, the authorities are deeply concerned that unscrupulous elements will resell the inexpensive Hong Kong rice for profit as the price of rice has been again raised by speculative elements. Therefore, the sales figures of firms which purchase the Shanghai Municipal Council's rice will be strictly investigated daily. As for groups and factories that apply to the foreign firm for permission to purchase the Shanghai Municipal Council's rice, those with a quantity of several dozen bags which are definitely for their own consumption will be supplied by various rice stores, but those with a large number will not be approved.

Ningbo and Shaoxing Obtain Less Than 10,000 Bags of Rice

Rice merchants use the excuse that Ningbo and Shaoxing merchants are purchasing rice to raise prices. According to inquiries made by a *Ta Tung She* reporter to Shanghai groups from Zhejiang Province, in addition to the 500 bags obtained in the first batch and the 1,000-plus bags obtained in the second batch by the Ningbo merchants, the most rice to be obtained recently is estimated to be 5,000 bags inclusive of the above numbers. As the silver is tight locally, Shanghai Ningbo gentry will not support economic measures in regard to the complex situation in Ningbo. Therefore, the number of rice purchased is very small. The rice purchased in Shanghai by Shaoxing merchants is less than 3,000 bags. Therefore, in total, less than 10,000 bags of rice has been purchased. Given the abundance of rice stocks in Shanghai, the number of bags obtained by Ningbo and Shaoxing merchants is just a drop in the bucket. This has no effect on the entire rice market in Shanghai.

Rumors That Rice Store Employees Will Strike

More than 1,000 rice store clerks and laborers citywide, affected by high rice and wage costs, jointly submitted a request to rice store owners on the 24th of this month for increased salaries and improved treatment, with a deadline of three days for a satisfactory response. However, the rice store owners, citing poor business conditions, have instead laid off a large number of employees, and have not responded to the conditions proposed, which has caused dissatisfaction among the employees of various rice stores. It is rumored that a joint strike will be announced starting today to prompt the capitalists to realize their mistake.

Now more than two weeks later, with the mutual understanding of both parties, the main factory and all branch factories have fully resumed operations.

Procedures for Transporting Goods to Switzerland

Must Wait for Approval from the British Ministry of Economic Warfare According to news from the Information Office of the British Embassy, ​​official notice has been received regarding the method of applying for navigation licenses for the following goods transported to Switzerland, and certain provisions have been made. For goods such as coal, wheat, oats, rye, barley, corn, and other general grains, tinplate, tinplate basins, carbon rods, raw rubber, mineral oil, tung oil, vegetable oil, animal oil, fats, cocoa, cocoa butter, honey, tea, raw wool, raw cotton, etc., those who intend to export from Switzerland, the British representative overseas does not accept any navigation license requests. However, those who wish to transport the above-mentioned goods to Switzerland can submit the request to the local Swiss authorities. After obtaining the approval of the War Economy Department in London and paying the normal fees, the British Embassy will issue a navigation license. The iron gates connecting the French Concession to the Nanshi district have been closed since Hibashima Kikuji, the captain of the Japanese military police in Nanshi, was assassinated on the 24th of this month. After three days, the gates were opened at 8 am yesterday. However, the inspection of people entering was very strict. According to a *Ta Tung She* reporter who visited the gates in person, the iron gate on Xinqiao Street only allowed entry and exit on foot. The iron gate on Dongxinqiao Street allowed vehicles and items to pass. The iron gate on Nanyangqiao Street designated the Fangbang Road side as the entrance, and the Min Tini Yin Road side as the exit. The gates on the inclined bridge of Xinkai River were also opened at the same time. The French, Vietnamese, and Chinese detectives of the French Police were extremely strict in their inspections. After entering the Chinese territory, they were then subjected to meticulous inspections by Japanese sentries.

### Many Young Englishmen Enlist and Return Home to Serve Their Country; Four Will Leave Shanghai This Week, and Dozens More Next Month

Mr. Huarays, the British army officer in this port responsible for recruiting British expatriates, told reporters yesterday that since Sir [Fredrick] Maze, the British Ambassador, called on young British men in this area to serve their country, businesses in this port are adjusting their employees to give young British men the opportunity to serve their country. The young British men who have enlisted also deeply understand that serving in the military is more important than working here. Therefore, the number of people who have signed up to enlist in the army has increased sharply in recent days. Among them, some are not British citizens but are also willing to serve in the British army. The transportation problem for new recruits depends on the convenience of ships heading south. It is reported that four people will leave Shanghai this week, and fifty to sixty people will leave Shanghai in June to serve in the British army. The age of the British expatriates who serve in the British army must be between nineteen and thirty years old, and they must be healthy to be qualified. It is said that the British army accepts all non-British citizens who are willing to serve the United Kingdom, but there may be difficulties with the passports they hold, because some countries usually do not allow people of certain nationalities to enter the country.

The Japanese Ship Narutomaru Sets Sail for Ningbo for Export

Small cargo and passenger loading of a test voyage

The Japanese military has not issued a navigation permit. The East Asia Shipping Company, a Japanese company, dispatched the Yangtze River liner Narutomaru to change its route to the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It first entered the shipyard for repairs and was moored at buoy No. 19 on the 22nd of this month, waiting to sail to Ningbo, etc. This has been reported in previous newspapers. According to the company's previous announcement, the Japanese Navy Department has not yet issued a navigation permit for the Shanghai-Ningbo line, and it is still difficult to set sail for a while. Unexpectedly, the ship suddenly sailed out of the port to Ningbo around 9 o'clock the night before, as a test voyage, without any passengers or cargo, an empty ship to Ningbo. It is expected to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow. It is said that the navigation permit has not yet been issued, so it is still difficult to determine whether the ship can officially open to traffic after its test voyage back to Shanghai.

Coal Market Black Market Rises Again Due to Market Bully Harassment

The coal market trade has not improved in recent days. The price of smoke-free white coal per catty [unit of weight] has been sluggish in the past few days, and at the same time, foreign exchange continues to ease, so the overall coal market situation has not changed much. However, the holders are reluctant to devalue and sell off. According to another source, the black market for coal briquettes has resurfaced. Although the price was once quoted at 275 yuan per ton, it has now been raised to 290 yuan. It is reported that this is due to major coal briquette companies buying up at low prices and market bullies hoarding goods. However, according to people familiar with the coal market, this situation is unlikely to last. The large quantities of smoke-free white coal that the coal industry has previously traded have now been shipped to Shanghai in batches from Annam [Vietnam] and India. It is said that about 70,000 to 80,000 tons have arrived at the port, and more than 50,000 tons are already on their way to Shanghai and will arrive here soon. The French Concession Water and Electricity Company reported to the French Consulate General due to an unexpected special difficulty in the supply of diesel fuel. At the same time, the Electricity Control Committee of the French Concession also stated the actual situation. Now the French Consulate has stipulated restrictive regulations, and its decree says: In order to implement the matter, according to the report of the General Manager of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company on April 25, 1941 regarding the unexpected special difficulty in the supply of diesel fuel, and the report of the Electricity Control Committee on the same day, in accordance with Article 13 of the Shanghai French Concession Public Works Bureau Organization Regulations of January 15, 1927, the following articles are formulated and announced.

Restrictions on the amount of light, power and heat

Article 1. From May 15, 1941, during the period of insufficient diesel fuel supply in Shanghai, the following methods shall be followed for electricity consumption control: (A) Electric light and power: The monthly electricity consumption for electric light in residences, shops, warehouses, factories, workshops, etc., shall be limited to the amount used in the same month of 1940. If there is no amount used in the same month for comparison, the amount used in the previous month of 1941 shall prevail. The restriction method for power consumption is the same as the previous item. The above two restriction methods do not apply to the current required for the installation of advertising decorations (such as advertising placards and signs that consume a large amount of current), the current required for lanterns, and strong searchlights. The Electricity Control Committee has the right to prohibit or reduce the consumption of this large amount of current based on the application of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company and the special commissioner of the Police Department. The Electricity Control Committee has the right to decide on the requests of interested parties. (B) Electric heat: The use of current for electric heat is prohibited, except for the following uses, which are divided into four types of uses: industrial combustion, bakeries, medical equipment, and electric stoves. However, under any circumstances, the monthly electric heat consumption shall not exceed the amount used in the same month of 1940. If there is no amount used in the same month for comparison, the amount used in the previous month of 1941 shall be the highest limit.

Expansion of equipment is rejected

Article 2. Expansion of equipment and new users: The French Concession Water and Electricity Company shall refuse to supply electricity to new users or those who request to expand the original equipment, but this does not apply to the electricity required for private water intake equipment, elevators, and household refrigerators in newly built or to be built residences, as well as the electric light equipment required for the residences. Article 3. Exceptions: The Electricity Control Committee has the right to determine the amount of electricity to be used by users in special circumstances.

Stop supply for exceeding electricity consumption

Article 4. Penalties: If a user exceeds the amount of electricity specified in the above articles in a certain month, the amount of electricity they use shall be reduced in the following month. In addition to immediately notifying the user, the French Concession Water and Electricity Company shall also report to the Electricity Control Committee. The committee may recommend that the French Concession Administrative Authority order the suspension of electricity supply for several days. The number of days of suspension shall be at least equal to the quotient of dividing the overdraft amount by one-thirtieth of the monthly permitted electricity consumption. Article 5. After the promulgation of the above provisions, the previous promulgated measures, such as the notices on March 8 and 15, 1941, shall be declared abolished. Article 6. This decree shall be supervised by the Public Works Bureau, the Chief of the Police Department, and the Electricity Control Committee, each within the scope of their duties.

### Mixing Broken Rice into Foreign Rice for Sale; Rice Merchant Sentenced to Fine; Municipal Council Strictly Prohibits Mixed Sales; Two Rice Shops Accused of Fraud

The price of rice in this city once soared. The price of foreign rice per picul [unit of volume] also reached 150 yuan, which was unbearable for the common people. The investigation results of the Public Concession Municipal Council determined that it was caused by rice smugglers manipulating the market. Although severe sanctions have been taken in the past, the effect has been minimal.

The authorities strictly prohibit mixing and selling

Therefore, the Municipal Council immediately purchased a large amount of foreign rice directly from Hong Kong and distributed it to various rice shops in the city for sale. The price was set at 110 yuan per picul, and the price at which the rice shops took goods from the Municipal Council was only 106 yuan per picul. The profit of 7 or 8 yuan or so per picul could be obtained even with the sack. The authorities were deeply afraid that the rice shops might mix or sell inferior rice as a substitute, so they specially dispatched commissioners to investigate.

Exploiting the Common People, Unscrupulous Merchants Fined

On the 17th of the month, Zhang Hexiang, the Chinese head constable of the Huizi [Hongkou] Police Station, found that the Xintai Rice Shop at No. 175 North Jiangxi Road, although it had a market sign for selling Municipal Council foreign rice, the rice sold was not actually Municipal Council rice, and the quality was much inferior to that of the Municipal Council rice. He immediately reported it to the Political Department and asked the First Special Court to issue a warrant to Wang Shoucheng, the owner of the rice shop from Jiangwan. Judge Dai Rongduo opened the fourth criminal court for interrogation. The police lawyer Fang Fushu prosecuted him for fraud and requested severe punishment according to law. After questioning by Judge Dai, he decided to fine Wang Shoucheng 300 yuan as a warning.

Huang Baolin Case to be Heard Tomorrow

In addition, the Yucheng Gong Rice Shop at No. 182 to No. 184 Aierkaoke Road [now Huangpi South Road] also sold inferior rice as Municipal Council foreign rice in the same way. Zhang Yunsheng, the Chinese detective of the Huishan [Hongkou] Police Station, found out and sued the shop owner Huang Baolin to the First Special Court according to law. It is reported that the First Special Court has scheduled to hear the case this Thursday by Judge Meng Tingzhang in the fourth criminal court.

### Bloodshed on Avenue Edward VII Yesterday Afternoon; Yin Zhanqing Shot Dead

Wounded in the head and chest, died of serious injuries; a stray bullet also killed a hawker

At about 12:00 noon yesterday, a sniper attack occurred at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII [now Yan'an East Road] and Wenzhou Road in the Public Concession. The person who was sniped was named Yin Zhanqing, who was the deputy captain of the Special Police Reconnaissance Team in western Shanghai. He died on the spot due to serious injuries. At the same time, a stray bullet killed a hawker. The details of the incident are described below.

Suddenly attacked on the way home for lunch

Yin Zhanqing, a native of Nantong, was 50 years old and lived at No. 4, Alley 11, Wenzhou Road. He also opened a Ludong Sauce and Vinegar Factory in that house. He once served as a detective in the Public Concession Police Department. When the Special Police was established, Yin was appointed as the deputy captain of the Reconnaissance Team. At about 12:00 noon yesterday, Yin returned home for lunch in his own car. Unexpectedly, when the car arrived at the entrance of the alley, just as he was getting out of the car to enter the alley, a man suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and shot at him with a gun, firing four or five shots in a row.

Yin and Mao Died One After Another

At that time, Yin was caught off guard and was hit by three bullets. One bullet entered from behind his left ear and exited through his right eye, one bullet hit his chest, and another bullet grazed his right wrist. He immediately fell heavily into a pool of blood. At the same time, a hawker named Mao Xianjin (30 years old, living at No. 149 Changsha Road) was hit in the right breast by a stray bullet and also fell to the ground with serious injuries. The gunman fled without a trace after his goal was achieved. Afterwards, the police station dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene and send Yin and Mao to Baolong Hospital for emergency treatment in a car. Because both of them were injured in vital parts, they could not be saved and died one after another. The police station is now investigating the case.

### Director of the Yantai Shenzhuang Embezzles Huge Sum of Money

The total amount reached more than 80,000 yuan; Zhang Donglu confessed without hesitation

Zhang Donglu (36 years old, from Shandong), the director of the Yantai Tianhexing Exchange Shop Shenzhuang, in Tongjulong Inn, No. 5 Tianzhutang [Catholic Church] in the French Concession, was found to have embezzled more than 80,000 yuan of public funds. The Yantai head office sent a representative, Shi Huanting, to Shanghai to investigate and found it to be true. He reported it to the French police station, and ordered the detectives to arrest Zhang. After interrogation, Zhang confessed that in addition to his own share of the surplus of more than 10,000 yuan, he had embezzled 67,000 yuan of public funds. Subsequently, according to Zhang's confession, the police station sent detectives to the Qingdao Photography Studio at No. 448 Avenue Joffre [now Huaihai Middle Road] to retrieve Zhang's deposit book, Maoli Company deposit, blue checkered stocks, and Lianxinghao deposit book, totaling more than 27,000 yuan, and took them to the police station together. Because there were still tens of thousands of yuan of stolen money that could not be retrieved, the police station is now trying to investigate.

### Seven-Year-Old Child Almost Kidnapped

The patrol constable discovered and bravely rescued him

Jin Erkang is an accountant in the Taile Yanghang [trading company] in this port. He lives at No. 54, Sanyuanfang, Xinzha Road in the Public Concession. He has a son named Wu Lu, who is seven years old and studies at a nearby elementary school. At 8:40 am yesterday, Jin's child finished breakfast at home and left home for school with his schoolbag. Unexpectedly, just as he left the alley, three bandits came forward, stopped him, forcibly dragged his hand, and ran towards Seymour Road [now Shaanxi North Road]. Because the child did not know any of the three people, he shouted wildly along the way. A patrol constable in the area caught sight of it and knew that the bandits were kidnapping the child. He stepped forward to chase and arrest them. The three bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, abandoned the child and fled in a rush. The constable bravely chased after them and caught one bandit. He took the bandit and the little hostage back to the police station together. The police station escorted Jin's child back home.

### Arrest of Criminals in the Grand Shanghai Theater Bombing Case

The North China Daily News reported that the bombing incident at the Grand Shanghai Theater on Thursday night of last week was committed by a 17-year-old Korean, who has been arrested. After interrogation by the Laozha [old Zhabei] Police Station, he has been handed over to the Japanese authorities. It is reported that at about 10 pm on Thursday night, when the Grand Shanghai Theater was showing "Heroes on the Sea," someone suddenly dropped four smoke bombs under the screen. Suddenly, thick smoke filled the air, the film was stopped, and the audience left one after another after exchanging tickets for other shows. Afterwards, detectives from the Laozha Police Station made every effort to investigate. At about 3 pm on Sunday, they received a report that the bomber was hiding in Youth Road, Min Ti Ni Yin Road [now today unknown], so they went to the YMCA together with detectives from the French Concession to search. The bomber was indeed among them, surrendered without resistance, and was taken to the Laozha Police Station. It is believed that he has confessed to committing the crime. He was immediately handed over to the Japanese authorities. It is reported that the Korean's purpose in bombing was only to intimidate the theater owner, not a retaliatory measure as initially expected by the general public. The Korean intended to extort "protection money" from the theater.

### Truth Revealed in the Explosion on Rue Lagrenée

Ma A'gen was fooled by someone and asked to send it to a foreign goods store; mistakenly thought it was food and sent it to the Yu family

The explosion of a bomb in the room of the second floor of the Huifeng Paper Store, No. 32 Rue Lagrenée [now Huanghe Road] in the French Concession, resulting in the injury and death of many women, has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the police station is paying close attention to the case. Since the Yu family is neither rich nor has any enemies, where did the bomb come from? Therefore, the police station ordered detectives to investigate strictly and bring the perpetrators to justice. It was not until 11 pm the night before that a Chinese detective discovered that the person who placed the bomb was named Chen A'gen, also known as Ma A'gen the toilet cleaner, who was 40 years old and was hiding in the Rue Lafayette [now Fuxing Middle Road] area. He was immediately arrested and taken to the police station. After being interrogated by the Western Detective Chief, Chen A'gen confessed that he had been working as a toilet cleaner for a living, but had been unemployed for a long time and had been wandering around. At 10 am this morning, he met an unknown person near Huanghe Road, who handed him the tin can and asked him to send it to a foreign goods store on Great Horse Road [now Nanjing East Road], but did not specify what was inside. He mistakenly thought it was canned food, so he took it to his relative Yu's house. He really did not know that it was a bomb, and begged for leniency. He was ordered to be detained and investigated in detail.

### Five Pickpockets Caught

Between Jielu [East Jinling Road], Baoshan Road, and North Henan Road, there are often pickpockets lurking and taking the opportunity to show off their skills.

They often steal money from pedestrians without their knowledge. At about 4 pm yesterday, the meeting place of the gang was discovered by Chinese Detective Chief Feng Baishun, Deputy Detective Chief Huang Fusen, Detective Deng Ruxin, and Liang Yuliang of the Huizi [Hongkou] Police Station. They went to arrest them all together and confiscated a large number of stolen goods. The police station is hoping that those who have recently been stolen in this area will report it.

### Major Gambling Dens in Western Shanghai to Close by the End of the Month

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that Pan Da, the head of the Special Police in western Shanghai, told reporters this morning (27th) that major gambling dens in the outer road area of ​​western Shanghai will be closed before midnight on May 31, otherwise he will personally seal them up. The gambling dens that must be closed by May 31 include the Six Nations Hotel, the Chinese General Association, the United Overseas Chinese General Association, the Falanse General Association, and the Ivantai Nightclub. It is found that these five places are the largest gambling dens in the western district and are protected by influential people, making it difficult for the Special Police to restore the normalcy of the western district. According to people in the Six Nations Hotel, the gambling den will be closed in compliance with the order. It is believed that other major gambling dens will also close down accordingly. It is estimated that in addition to the major gambling dens, there are still more than 100 small gambling dens and about 24 opium dens in the western district. The western district has also become a breeding ground for all kinds of crimes, making it quite difficult for the police to arrest criminals who have fled into the area.

### Finance; Foreign Exchange Market Soars Suddenly

Easing Trend Gradually Returns to Normal

The foreign exchange market yesterday was as follows: The HSBC posted prices at 9:30, revealing that both the British and American exchange rates had increased by 0.0625, the British exchange rate was 3/16, and the American exchange rate was 5.25 yuan. There was no market for French and German exchange rates. Only the tea exchange rate did not change. Other exchange rates such as [Indian] Rupee and Hong Kong also increased accordingly. The black market for British and American exchange rates continued to ease strongly in the morning. Although a few Chinese speculators were still covering short positions for May American exchange rates, they were selling large amounts of June positions. Initially, Chinese banks such as Dalu [Continental Bank] saw a slight increase in cheap prices, and when they heard that the British HSBC had profits, they also sold one after another. Although American banks did not enjoy it, the easing trend turned sharp at noon. The June positions could once be settled at 5.5 yuan. The British exchange rate was even more unpopular, and it then hardened to 3/16 3.59375. In the afternoon, speculators continued to sell constantly and sold June American dollars at 5.5 yuan. At that time, the banks' appetite was better than at noon. Unexpectedly, in the last half hour, speculators were setting up to scrape, and the easing degree of the American exchange rate was swept back to normal, finally at 5.4375 yuan, the same as the previous day's price. The British gold also softened slightly to 3/16 3.4375, still easing by 0.03125. The trading was extremely active throughout the day. It is said that speculators also scraped out 200,000 US dollars.

Selling is still strong in the morning market

Since the morning overseas telegraphic silver market, the British, American, and Indian markets have all remained unchanged. The exchange rate of each country against Shanghai has risen by 4 points, and the rest are flat. The central posted prices for all exchange rates are flat. In the early morning, the banks' selling prices for spot goods were flat. The British exchange rate was 3/16 3.328125. First, it was strongly sold to Dalu [Continental Bank] June American dollars at 5.46875 yuan. There were also cover purchases HSBC May 5.4375 yuan. The market situation was stable and trending upward. Speculators also sold to a certain Chinese bank May also 5.46875 yuan. At that time, the June positions had hardened to the point where they could be settled at the above price. When HSBC posted prices, both the British and American markets increased. After the white silver balance tax was still slightly 23.75%, the Chinese speculators sold even more urgently. They sold June 5.5 yuan even more strongly. The banks, except for American merchants who purchased slightly, and English banks such as Ewo [Jardine Matheson & Co.] also spit out May 5.46875 yuan, so the June positions once hardened even more to 5.5 yuan and were difficult to sell or could be settled. The British exchange rate habits were watching, and the pace was increasing strongly. Until the market closed at noon, the first order was 3/16 3.59375 and the American dollar was 5.46875.

Speculation suddenly came to scrape

In the early afternoon, it was still stable and slightly easier. Speculators offered this month's 5.5 yuan, and the banks had little intention to buy. At three-thirty, a strange peak emerged. Speculators turned to violently scrape 5.46875 yuan and 5.4375 yuan in May and June. Foreign merchants and various firms took the opportunity to pull up prices, and the situation became tight again. The closing price at four o'clock for spot goods to June was 3/16 3.4375 for the British exchange rate, still increasing by 0.015625, and the American dollar was 5.4375, both scraping flat.

### Rumors Spread, Gold Market Recovers After Fall

Yesterday, the gold market was sluggish in grey sheet dealings, remaining flat and weak throughout the day. However, in the final half-hour before closing, it suddenly surged. Inquiries revealed that the market's sentiment, which had been uniformly bearish due to President Roosevelt's fireside chat, was abruptly reversed by rumors of a postponement, leading to a tightening of foreign exchange.

The market opened low in the morning at 6,360 yuan. Shun Yuan and De Cheng money shops each sold a thousand-odd taels. Exchange houses like Xin Feng Yong offered five or six thousand taels. Yi Yuan, Yi Da, and Yi Yuan also repeatedly dumped gold. The U.S. dollar weakened to five and a half yuan, pushing the price down to the 6,300 yuan mark, reaching a low of 6,305 yuan.

Guangdong banking houses Heng Ji and Da Feng, along with gold shops, absorbed the supply, slightly reversing the downward trend. The afternoon started flat and weak, but after 3:30 PM, rumors spread that speculators had softened their position on the U.S.-Japanese exchange rate. Although Xin Feng Yong released over two thousand taels, the buying momentum had already started. Guangdong banking houses and securities firms rushed to buy, and short sellers covered their positions, leading to a sharp rebound to 6,365 yuan.

Jewelry gold prices also rose by five yuan, reaching 695 yuan. Reports on customs gold and other gold were similar.

Once Close to the 300 Yuan Mark

The market opened at 6,360 yuan per bar (ten taels) at 9:15 AM, down nine yuan from the previous evening's close. Foreign exchange rates were soft, with U.S. dollars for next month quoted at 5.46875 yuan for settlement. Sentiment weakened further, and De Fu, Ren Cheng Yong, and Xin Feng Yong rushed to sell, leading to an immediate decline. De Cheng and Shun Yuan money shops were particularly eager to sell, pushing the price down by 35 yuan to 6,325 yuan. Cheng Ji, Xiang He, and Xiang Xing Yong aggressively bought, raising the price to 6,342 yuan.

The market then remained stable for a long time until around 11:00 AM, when money shops continued to sell aggressively. News that U.S. dollars for June were difficult to sell even at 5.50 yuan led to even more aggressive selling by Yi Da, Yi Yuan, Jin Yuan, and Ren Cheng Yong, causing a drop of over 30 yuan to 6,350 yuan. At noon, Heng Ji, Da Feng, Xin Yuan, Gong Da, and Yi Da absorbed the supply, raising the price to 6,335 yuan. The noon close was 6,329 yuan.

The market opened in the afternoon at 2:00 PM at 6,333 yuan, up four yuan. Next, it was at 28 yuan, and Heng Ji aggressively bought, raising the price to 6,338 yuan. With U.S. dollars for this month difficult to sell even at 5.50 yuan, Xin Feng Yong, Ren Cheng Yong, and De Fu sold again, pushing the price down to 6,318 yuan. Yi Da, Chi Da, Heng Ji, Da Feng, He Sheng, and Shi He aggressively bought, gradually raising the price. After 3:30 PM, multiple rumors resurfaced, causing a rapid rise to 6,365 yuan. Yi Li, Yi Da, and Xin Feng Yong dumped again, pushing it down to 6,348 yuan. De Fu bought again, and the market closed at 4:00 PM at 6,362 yuan, down seven yuan from the previous evening's close. U.S. dollars for June were settled at 5.4375 yuan, equivalent to 6,404.6 yuan, a difference of 42.6 yuan. The market rose again to 6,370 yuan after closing.

The total range for the day was 60 yuan. The selling price of cash gold from local shops was 380 yuan higher than the grey sheet deferred price, and the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. Spot gold had no quoted price and no market.

Jewelry Gold Falls and Then Recovers

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang initially quoted 690 yuan, rising by five yuan at 4:15 PM to 695 yuan (buying price less 40 yuan), it was said.

### Japanese Gold Notes Rise by Two Yuan

In the foreign currency market yesterday, grey sheet prices fell before recovering. British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan before recovering by one yuan in the afternoon, resulting in no change from the previous day. British gold notes remained stagnant and unchanged, with the market price steady. American gold notes fell to 17.90 yuan at one point, eventually closing at 18.06 yuan, down one cent from the previous day. Hong Kong notes remained soft. Japanese gold notes broke the two-yuan mark, falling to 1.99 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes remained weak, falling to 1.68 yuan in the evening market.

### Food: Rice Market Fluctuates Wildly; Speculators Use "Fishing in Troubled Waters" Tactics

The foreign rice market rose and then fell yesterday, with the market presenting a chaotic picture. Prices surged by four, five, and six yuan in the morning, followed by a sharp drop of one, two, and three yuan in the afternoon, with rapid rises and falls being the norm. Speculators, like rice weevils, were attempting to stimulate the market in order to raise prices again. Other speculators, like those who "kick the ball" and "pass it to the top," were also eager to take advantage of the situation to create opportunities for "fishing in troubled waters." As a result, the market became more and more chaotic, and prices were driven higher and higher.

The rice market was originally boosted by pre-festival purchases from local customers, and further stimulated by purchases from inland areas and re-exports by Japanese merchants. As a result, after the market opened in the morning, all varieties of foreign rice rose sharply amid strong buying interest. Number One Saigon rose from about 123-124 yuan to 126 yuan, Number Two from 117-118 yuan to 122 yuan, Min Dang white from 119 yuan to 124 yuan, and Small Grade from about 117-118 yuan to 120 yuan. English-Chinese firm returned four-five month contracts were particularly strong, with Small Grade initially at 139 yuan and 140 yuan, then rising to 141 yuan and 142.5 yuan. Broken rice rose from 107.5 yuan to 108-109 yuan, 110 yuan, and 111 yuan. Saigon rose to 147-148 yuan, up by four, five, and six yuan compared to the previous evening.

In addition to the reasons mentioned above, the price increases were also attributed to rumors about the subsidized sale of Vietnamese rice, which had not been officially announced. Sales in the International Settlement had a significant impact, with over 100,000 bags sold, and further batches were expected. The French Municipal Council's subsidized sale of Saigon rice was also being planned, and would soon be implemented. Market manipulators who spread rumors to raise prices would only find themselves working in vain and digging their own graves.

Around noon, sales slowed down, and major hoarders began to release their holdings to take profits. The price rise was frustrated, and the market turned weak, with prices falling by one or two yuan. The closing prices were Number One Saigon at 122-123 yuan, Number Two at 118-119 yuan, Number Two Siam at 118 yuan, Min Dang at 121 yuan, and Small Grade at 118 yuan. Tokyo Special Grade was at 112 yuan, and Broken Special at 96 yuan.

Overall, the market rose and fell, resulting in a net increase of two to four yuan. Nearly 30,000 bags of spot rice were traded, along with 2,000 tons of futures.

Domestic rice, including thick and thin Japonica varieties, was in short supply. As foreign rice prices soared, the market sentiment turned bullish. Not only did sellers become more demanding, but local shops also saw improved sales. As a result, prices rose in tandem, increasing by two or three yuan. South Port early and late rice special grade was quoted at 137 yuan, ordinary at 135 yuan, and second grade at 132 yuan. Original package was at 138 yuan, and ingot at 132 yuan. There was no market for original Japonica rice from Xixi, with only fresh Japonica from Kunshan quoted at 135 yuan, ordinary at 132 yuan, and second grade at 128 yuan.

Glutinous rice saw strong demand and good sales, leading to price increases of two to three yuan. Hong Kong round grain glutinous rice was quoted at 114-115 yuan, and long grain ranged from 112-113 yuan to about 110 yuan. Ordinary domestic glutinous rice in original packages was at 104 yuan and 102 yuan.

### Flour Market Tightens and Then Loosens; Hoarders Dump at High Prices

Flour: Trading in foreign flour has been active in recent days. Since foreign flour became cheaper than factory flour last Friday, it has gradually attracted some local retail sales, stabilizing the market. Market conditions at the end of last week continued to hover, with Golden Dragon flour opening at 29 yuan, Fortress flour at 29.56 yuan, Double Eagle flour at 28.5 yuan, and Fortune God flour at 28.15 yuan.

At the beginning of this week, due to the rice market rally, flour also attracted attention from northern merchants, and prices rose slightly, with Golden Dragon flour rising to 29.23 yuan, Fortress flour to 29.8 yuan, and Fortune God flour to 28.23 yuan, each rising by two to three cents.

The market looked even better when it opened yesterday, as both northern and southern merchants inquired and the rice market continued to rise, creating a bullish sentiment. Golden Dragon flour rose from 29.5 yuan to 29.8 yuan. However, current inventories were ample and the outlook for the new wheat crop was uncertain, so hoarders dumped their holdings at high prices, causing the market to flatten out later. Golden Dragon flour closed at 29.5 yuan, Fortress flour at 30.05 yuan, Double Eagle flour at 28.9 yuan, and Flower Bird flour at 30.065 yuan, a total of 22,000 to 23,000 bags, resulting in an increase of five to six cents. However, the market outlook has loosened, and the market base is difficult to consolidate. Hua Chang plain flour remains at 29 yuan, and is unlikely to change in the near future. It is generally expected that a decision will be made after the new wheat crop is harvested.

In addition, 1,100 bags of flour, loaded on the Taikoo Hanyang wheel, will be exported to Xiamen today (28th).

### Oilseed Cake: Bullish Traders Lose Momentum; Market Prices Fall Again and Again

Yesterday's miscellaneous grains and oilseed cake market remained in a state of cautious consolidation. Soybean oil and soybeans showed a slight recovery, while corn fell slightly, so the overall market was uninspiring. Soybean cake sales were sluggish, while skin-ball futures were active, with prices fluctuating rapidly. As a result, bullish traders lost momentum, and market prices fell again compared to the previous day, with a total of over 40,000 pieces of Shen Ji futures traded.

May lower hold single loss June upper term delivery price from 19 yuan 6 corners, step up to 8 corners and a half, re-fall to 4 corners, June upper hold single loss June upper delivery price for 19 yuan 9 corners to 20 yuan 1 corner, June upper hold single loss June lower delivery price from 20 yuan 4 corners, fall to 2 corners, turn up to 6 corners, re-fall straight to 1 corner, existing cake only open Li Zi cake 1000 pieces, price for 17 yuan 5 corners.

In addition, 200 pieces of raw oil arrived from Tianjin yesterday (27th).

Today (28th), 1,320 bags of soybeans and 300 bags of raw kernels will be exported to Xiamen. Another 355 bags of soybeans and 500 bags of sesame seeds will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Securities: Government Bonds Rise Across the Board

Government Bond Grey Market: Yesterday's market saw a gradual strengthening of the uptrend. Hong Da and Tian Sheng showed strong buying interest in the morning, and Xin Fu also began to buy. As a result, Lian Yi, Xie Kang, and Le Mao also attracted buying interest. Lian He, Xin Hua, and Yi Zhong were mostly sold, with the remainder supplied by scattered retail investors. The noon close rose slightly by three to four cents, but there was no change in Type A bonds.

The uptrend continued in the afternoon, with Hong Da, Tian Sheng, and Xin Fu showing excellent buying interest, which was noteworthy. Xie Xing Yuan and No. 31 also showed strong purchasing power. Type C bonds broke through seven yuan, with Tong Kang, Lian He, Run De, Yi Zhong, Hu He Ji, and Jiu Feng all showing selling activity, but the buyers still dominated. As a result, prices rose by one cent to six and a half cents, with a total turnover of over 1.2 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock Transactions: 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 18.5 yuan.

Public utility stocks remained extremely quiet, and market sentiment was uncertain. Prices recovered slightly before the close. Rubber stocks were stagnant and soft.

London, 26th (Monday) Report: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East company stocks remained flat. Shanghai Tramway Wuji shares fell by 2 shillings and 4 pence, to a price of 13 shillings and 8 pence. HSBC Bank Hong Kong registered shares rose by 2 pounds, to a price of 78 pounds, with prices listed but no actual transactions. There were no other changes.

### Yarn and Cotton: Bullish Traders Hold Factory Orders; Shuang Ma Set to Corner the Market

Shuang Ma opened in the morning with the first trade breaking the 1,400 yuan mark due to panic sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day, at a price of 1,397 yuan. Large quantities of sales were made on the market at this time, falling to 1,384 yuan, lingering quite long at 88, 89 yuan. After passing eleven o'clock, drafts were extended, benchmark gold fell, people's hearts were frightened, and it went straight down to 1,372 yuan. At this time the situation was terrible, but unexpectedly, too many chips were thrown out, leading to the saying of big head cornering the market, and it rose in an instant to 1,389 yuan when the market closed. The statistical trading volume for the half day was 13,270 bales. The amount of the respective groups that bought will be listed below.

### Cotton Trade: Only Soybean Oil Traders Add Some Flavor

Spot Cotton Situation: Even if fair, spot sales lack all the same, factory houses, because cloth outlet is no longer clear, so in regard to raw material intention calm also, today there is cotton twenty package carry to Hong Kong.

Another Bulletin: Shanghai Port foreign trading cotton exchange, in recent days on account of Yarn market continue fatigue, and foreign exchange continuously release long, hence market situation especially without lively performance, factory side neither take in stomach, people of the same trade also not dare massively purchase enters, yesterday only the same trade had resale and carry to outside port, two three batch persons, Brazil flower sell price for 400 yuan approximately also.

YMCA Conducts College Guidance Lecture

Various schools have been inquiring about the details of the college guidance lecture sponsored by the Student Department of the Chinese Christian Association, to assist high school graduates. Since it was published in various newspapers and periodicals, more than ten schools have sent letters inquiring about the detailed methods of participation. According to Mr. Ding Guangxun of the Student Department, the procedure for participation is very simple. The school authorities only need to send a letter to the Student Department of the Association to report the number of participants and the date. If participating in batches or on different days, it must also be noted on which day how many people will participate. Although the YMCA auditorium is large, it would be crowded if it accommodated too many people, and it would be difficult for the organizers.

Sports News: Public Concession Police Spring Games; Excellent Preliminary Results Yesterday

Chinese Constable Wu Huanian Sets New Record in 440 Yards: 56.6 Seconds

The 31st Police Spring Games held its preliminary round at the racecourse yesterday morning. Among the 22 events, the results for the Chinese were excellent. Chinese Constable Wu Huanian's time of 56.6 seconds in the 440-yard final broke the police department's highest record of 57.6 seconds, held by Mr. Sun Zhichong for many years, shortening the old record by more than a second. Mr. Wu was previously affiliated with the Chinese Athletics Team, which explains his excellent performance. Yesterday, Mr. Wu stood out among the Chinese constables, winning the 440-yard championship, the long jump championship, and the high jump runner-up. Winning three awards in one day was commendable. In the long jump event for Chinese inspectors, deputy inspectors, and clerks, the top three finishers were separated by only inches, demonstrating the intensity of the competition. In the two short-distance races, veteran Sun Zhichong won the first place in the second group. In the final on July 7, he will form a three-way rivalry with Wu Xiquan and Zhuo Guopei. Judging from the preliminary results, Wu Xiquan may retain the 100-yard title, while Sun Zhichong has high hopes for the 220-yard title. Although some say that Zhuo Guopei is sure to win the championship, Sun Zhichong's performance was far better than Zhuo's yesterday. The results of the Western constables' competition yesterday were unremarkable. The results sheet has not yet been finalized, but the results of the Chinese side are recorded below.

### Essentials of Guidance for Advancement and Employment (II)   Shen Guanglie (II)

The focus of guidance for advancement and employment is to simplify matters. First, focus on the main career direction indicated by the two words "guidance." School authorities should collect specific materials and offer sound advice as their normal duty. The final decision should rest with the student. Some teachers are too enthusiastic and decide everything on behalf of the student. This overstepping and meddling is a serious mistake and should be strictly avoided.

(III) There are two important bases for guidance work for advancement and employment: one is self-awareness, and the other is analysis of the matter. The former, such as the individual's interests, abilities, family, and environment, must be thoroughly considered and deeply understood by the student. The latter, such as the history, content, curriculum, teachers, and career prospects of the school, must be carefully investigated, researched, and analyzed. If it involves employment, the history of the industry, the conditions required, the compensation, and promotion prospects must also be understood. "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." Guidance work for advancement and employment has the same meaning.

I will now discuss the work that can be done based on the current school equipment, organization, teaching, and teacher capabilities.

(I) Understanding the student's family's economic situation, occupation, and health status. This is generally available in schools with slightly better management. However, the shortcoming is that it is often too general. For example, the classification of family occupations often uses agriculture, industry, commerce, medicine, academics, military police, and political parties as categories. Although this is more detailed than the old system, the scope of "industry" is very broad. Simply saying "industrial sector" is not enough to encompass the entire field. Economic and health information is relatively difficult to obtain accurately, but it is not entirely impossible.

(II) Understanding the local social situation. This is very important and relatively difficult to implement. The school must put forth its best effort to do so. Fortunately, once it has been determined through investigation, there is no need for repetitive work. Gradually extend the investigation to other areas and make revisions and supplements as needed.

(III) Investigating students' physical strength, intelligence, and academic ability. These are all easy tasks. For reliability, it may be advisable to conduct an investigation every academic year. For academic ability, as long as the usual semester and annual examinations are meticulous and lawful, it is not difficult to obtain readily available data.

(IV) Imparting vocational common sense. In addition to the existing textbooks, attention should be paid to imparting vocational common sense, such as guiding students to read books on vocational overviews, visiting companies and factories, and finding opportunities to arrange internships to deepen students' understanding of occupations.

(V) Enriching practical activities and hands-on learning subjects. The implementation of practical activities can be determined with reference to local conditions, without excessive uniformity. Furthermore, individual work should not be purely based on a single method. It may be divided into several groups, classified according to their interests. Other activities, such as drawing, games, and sports, have similar functions. In essence, expanding the scope of activities and varying the types of activities can help to develop or detect their hobbies, which is also very important in education.

(VI) Pay attention to students' reading and activity interests. Reading and activity interests also shift with teachers and the environment. With good guidance, they can all express their educational value. A good reading habit or a legitimate activity has a great impact on one's life and career. Educators should pay special attention to this.

(VII) Creating a complete student record book. Most schools have student record books, but few are complete. The usual items include the student's origin, parents, age, address, grades for each academic year, and occasionally physical condition, diseases, and behavioral habits. Some are even more detailed than this. In short, all attitudes and facts displayed by students during their school days that teachers should pay attention to should be included.

(VIII) Inquiring about students' families. Although home visits have many difficulties, their effectiveness is significant. On the one hand, they can clarify misunderstandings between families and the school, and on the other hand, they can understand the living conditions of both students and families and communicate opinions. In addition, family hygiene, economy, and educational facilities can also be understood. To achieve greater effects from school education, this kind of close cooperation must be implemented.

(IX) Lectures by professionals in various industries and school alumni. This is purely to help students understand the situation in various industries and the various facilities of the school, so that they have something to refer to. This can be arranged appropriately during the semester when students are about to graduate. Too early or too many can easily lead to boredom, which is not appropriate.

(X) Interviews and guidance. Conduct interviews and provide individual guidance to obtain useful facts as a basis for guidance. By graduation, students should have a concrete idea about studying or working and allow students to make their own choices.

(XI) Holiday remedial classes. Use the holidays to provide remedial classes for students' weak subjects, improve their grades, and enhance their abilities. Even the usual shortcomings can be remedied in this way. The above are all major points. Each school can make adjustments as needed. This is just a few examples. As for job seekers, the following organizations offer public introduction services in this city: the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center (80 Hualong Road), the YMCA Vocational Introduction Department (Carter Road), the Sino-American Daily Vocational Guidance Association (Aiduya Road), and the Lixin Accounting School Vocational Counseling Department (Jiangxi Road). These are all social service locations that do not charge fees and have a considerable reputation, and they also provide introductions. (End)

Talking Points

### "Adoptive Parents"

— Le Yunzhan

I don't know who started it, but in recent months, there have been many young people in the classified advertising section of newspapers seeking adoptive parents. Unless based on malicious speculation, this phenomenon in society cannot be considered entirely negative.

Those without children can readily become fathers and mothers, and there are so many applicants that prospective parents can leisurely choose. It compensates for Bo Dao's regrets and allows one to experience the joys of family. There is truly nothing cheaper than this in the world.

Although most applicants specify economic assistance as a condition, this is not only an obligation that parents should fulfill, but a son raised to adulthood has an incalculable cost in terms of the effort and spirit expended over the years. Moreover, money cannot be taken to the grave. Once you have become someone's parent, won't it eventually be theirs?

And such a son must be very filial and affectionate, trying to win the favor of the elders. As for appearance, I don't think anyone would want a consumptive drug addict or a vulgar wretch with nostrils open to the sky as a son! As for what's in their heart, that's something you have to "leave to fate," because even with biological sons, you only "give birth to their body, not their heart!" In fact, there's no need to worry. If you think they can't be kept, just as bad sons are expelled, adoptive sons can be separated. A few lines of advertising can tie and untie the knot, and the problem can still be solved in this way. If you say that you have already suffered a lot, I think parents have to bear this risk. After all, compared to biological sons, whose selection is beyond your control from the beginning, you can still carefully choose an adoptive son.

The above is all the truth.

At the same time, we should not ridicule applicants for seeking money. It should be known that many good young people are unable to pursue education or develop their careers due to a lack of resources. Among them, I truly don't know how many useful talents are buried. Don't you see that the applicants in the advertisements are all excellent in appearance and have high aspirations? If adoptive parents can truly treat their adoptive children as their own and can support their education and career development, their gratitude will not only be deeper than that of biological children, but their indirect contribution to society and the country will also be significant.

Those without sons should have an adoptive son, and even those with sons can have one. Rather than using useful money to let unworthy children commit crimes and do evil, why not create a few more useful talents for society! It's just that "a leper's son is the best," and I know that saying is empty.

As for the applicant obtaining the consent of the adoptive parents, I think it is necessary to publish a confirmation advertisement like a couple getting engaged and married. The simplest example is: "Mr./Ms. hereby formally recognizes Mr./Ms. as an adoptive son (or changes name to). To all relatives and friends who may not be aware, this is to inform you. Respectfully announced by Mr./Ms. and adoptive son."

In that case, with the status established, both parties have a legal basis for protection, which I think is beneficial to both. If you entrust a lawyer to make a statement on your behalf, that is of course even better.

### A Common Public Health Problem

— Xinan

I said, "Indeed! But in my opinion, your expenses are increasing and there is nowhere to replenish them. To be fair, the 'Three Zhies' (Shi Xingzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi) who run charitable organizations in Shanghai truly have the spirit of Buddhism. They are pragmatic and do not use charitable organizations as a front to struggle for social status. As long as they make a call, there is no fear of not being able to raise funds." He said, "However, they want to do practical work and never solicit donations from the outside. They are still using the old methods, but their businesses have new developments. Using old methods to cope with new developments means that even if the three elders have the ability to inspire, they are suffering from a lack of alchemic skills? Now, a dose of Chinese medicine costs at least one or two yuan, according to cost. Because the clinic is closed on Sundays, many patients who need to continue taking medicine have to temporarily add a dose outside, which costs three or four yuan. Only then do they realize that our free clinic is truly authentic, so more people are coming for treatment because of the power of 'two-legged advertising'!" I said, "What about the Western medicine department?" He said, "Minor external conditions, bandages, and ointments are still affordable, but for internal medicine, giving him two days' worth of medicine, and injecting him when necessary, costs even more." I said, "Injections are largely unnecessary, and are adding flowers to the brocade." He said, "It is difficult to open the door to charity, that is the truth. If it is truly a case where the injection is necessary to save him, not giving him the injection would mean, not only would he cry out weakly, 'Sir, save me!' but we would also feel unbearable in our hearts, so we can only endure the pain (the pain of medicine costs) and inject him anyway!" I said, "Good! Good! Now, those who chant the Buddha only have the Buddha in their mouths; how can they have the Buddha in their hearts: those who do charity, despite talking about charity, may have the three poisons in their chests even more developed than ordinary people; you can be Buddhist in heart and Buddhist in deed. According to the law of karma, planting good causes will definitely have good results, and you don't have to worry about not having anyone to help you." He said, "Because of this, our organization can maintain its business, precisely because of the voluntary donations of well-meaning people, according to their ability; indirectly, it has also greatly benefited those suffering from chronic illnesses." I said, "Doing good deeds must be done in a practical way! However, today's society is a hypocritical society, so Confucius hated the sycophant, precisely because he was deceiving the world and stealing fame; the famous do not necessarily have substance, while the unknown have actual practice; in theory, when substance arrives, fame will follow! But because newspapers are full of self-promotion, and those who like to do practical work are too unwilling to 'praise themselves', they are not noticed by the world; substance arrives but fame does not follow, things in the world are often like this. In fact, talking about almsgiving means that one does not see people, nor does one see oneself, nor does one see things. The 'three nothings' are necessary to run a charitable organization. Today's discussion of fame and substance has lost its way, but for the sake of business, one has to talk about fame and substance, talking about fame and substance is only for the world. I said to Gong Jun: "You should use your facts to seek public opinion from society. Society is full of people who are happy to do good and give alms. In order to relieve the suffering of general people from illness, especially those in the working class, you should think about your own situation and send you sympathy. Then, if you do this, you don't have to worry about lack of funding." I hope you have greater achievements for the public! Be a healthy ark for those who are suffering from illness! Don't say that it should be so from a religious standpoint, but also from the spirit of mutual aid of human beings. This is precisely one way to solve the difficulty of public medical and health problems, and people in society should pay attention to it! (End) (Donations to help medicine)

(VIII) Moving Friendship

Ji Zhaoxiong's death certainly made him feel very happy, but Shao Wen's rash action was different from his usual behavior, which made him feel very surprised; in addition to the joy and surprise, he felt extremely uneasy about his old friend being imprisoned for his sake.

"Seventh Master is too good!" After six or seven minutes, he slowly turned his face to the outer bed and looked at Yu Kun.

Yu Kun put down the newspaper, lightly jumped, and immediately sat on the edge of the bed.

"Really happy! Really a good friend! Tonight, I'm going to drink at least four taels of white spirits!" He raised a big thumb and said.

Since Yu Kun came yesterday, Qiu Haitang's worries had been somewhat settled, and his diet and sleep had improved significantly, but seeing this news today, his heart couldn't help but become chaotic again.

"Old brother, don't worry!" Although Yu Kun could only see a corner of his face outside the gauze, he could always perceive the changes in his expression. "Seventh Master is a master, and also a brigade commander. What does it matter if he kills a Ma? As the saying goes: officials protect each other. As long as he goes to court once, covers up the eyes of outsiders, he can come out immediately!"

Qiu Haitang didn't say anything, just sighed deeply.

"That's why I always say that women can't be approached!" Yu Kun rummaged in his pocket for his cow's whistle, and then took out a crumpled cigarette, carefully rubbing it in his palms, trying to make it tidier. "Look, this incident has not only harmed yourself, but also harmed a Yuan Seventh Master!"

For the past two days, his face had never shown any sign of drinking, and he often took out and put back a broken cigarette that was almost unsmokable, which suddenly reminded Qiu Haitang of something.

"Second brother, take the thirty dollars from here back with you today!"

"Money? It doesn't matter!" Yu Kun glanced at the room for a long time, but couldn't find a box of matches, so he hid the cigarette again. (117)

### Crawling

— Ren

Three bodies sat on the sofa, involuntarily rotating and twisting.

It was only the beginning of office hours.

The three silently read the newspaper, guarding the silence for a while. Now, the fat man in the middle threw the newspaper hard on the table, and then leaned his bloated back heavily on the sofa. "Old Wu!"

"..." The one on the left glanced back, saw that he had nothing else to say, and had to quickly withdraw his gaze to the tempting words "Sensual Dance, Generation Red Star, Awaiting Instruction at this Hall".

"If I had cut it a few days earlier, that would have been great." The thin man on the right, who had read the news about rice, muttered to himself, shaking his head repeatedly, regretting "knowing this was coming!" The fat man was feeling depressed and retorted angrily, "If there hadn't been this move, huh, two hundred yuan would have arrived early, maybe three hundred yuan..."

His thoughts immediately conjured up the scene at that time: five million, streamlined car, dancers, another incense nest, the deed transferred to his name, the vault...

He became somewhat irritated by his fantasies, stretched, and looked at the thin man on the right, still staring at the headline about rice prices falling and hoarders panicking. He was even more angry.

"Wu! Go to the market and ask." The one on the left quickly went to the phone, his shaking fingers dialing the number, and a trembling voice was transmitted from outside the receiver into the ears of the two people on the sofa who were like ants on a hot pan.

"Ah. Still small... people are tired... buyers are watching... The ship has arrived... Looks like it's going to fall even more, fall..."

The nerves of the three men cramped. Old Wu put down the phone, lazily returned to the sofa, staring blankly. The fat man leaned his back heavily again. The thin man waved the newspaper, deep in thought, "A stack is small..." Beautiful expectations turned into fleeting clouds. The surplus of five million yuan turned into wisps of illusory clouds.

The three of them writhed slightly, like three stunned insects, twisting weakly.

### Letter to the Editor

Request for Spiritual Food Rejected by Rice Food Editor:

We are a group of oppressed workers, and also loyal readers of your newspaper. In this society where the level of life is higher than everything else, our monthly wages are at most twenty yuan, and at least three yuan. It is difficult for us to afford shoes, socks, and clothes, let alone if we encounter illness. We can only groan in pain and wait to die when we get seriously ill. However, we can grit our teeth and endure these difficulties, but we only seek spiritual comfort. In order to seek knowledge, we subscribed to a newspaper in July last year. Only two months later, the factory used an unreasonable high-pressure method, using the excuse that reading the newspaper interfered with work, and confiscated our newspaper. From then on, we could not enjoy the newspaper. After more than a month (October), we subscribed to another newspaper to comfort our spirits. This newspaper was repeatedly confiscated and repeatedly negotiated. Intermittently, on April 27, it was confiscated by the factory again. Repeated negotiations were unsuccessful, and they said that we were confronting the factory and expelled eleven of us. For the sake of seeking knowledge, we were expelled from hunger by this evil force. We have been away from the factory for three days and have only eaten two meals. We have no money. We have been fasting since last night, and for two days now. Now, for the sake of truth, justice, and humanity, please borrow a corner of your newspaper to appeal to all mankind. A group of expelled workers from the Needle Factory

### Random Notes on Movie Theater Program Guides

— Xinliang

In order to help audiences easily understand the plot of a movie, each movie theater is equipped with a "program guide" or "program booklet". Its English name is "Programme", which, in addition to listing the story of the movie, sometimes includes advertisements. In short, the main purpose of each "program guide" is to give audiences a general idea of the story in advance. Using it as an advertising tool is, of course, just a matter of utilization.

Speaking of the "program guides" of various theaters, they can be described as colorful and bizarre. Needless to say, the "program guides" printed by first-run movie theaters are much more magnificent than those of third- and fourth-run theaters. The program guides of the four first-run theaters of the Asia Film Company, Da Guangming, Nanjing, Guotai, and Da Shanghai, are all consistent and neat. There are virtually no Chinese or English typos. Brown printing is their characteristic. Da Hua's is even more exquisite than the above four. In addition to the better paper, it uses red and black double-set colors for printing, which undoubtedly adds a lot of beauty. As for the second-run theaters, I think the program guides of Ping'an, Lido, Guanglu, and Jinmen are the most tidy. Lido Grand Theater used to print a booklet at the beginning of each month to tell the audience about the movies for the coming month, but now it is no longer seen. The program guide of the Paris Grand Theater seems a bit longer than the above ones, perhaps because it includes more previews, which looks quite chaotic. Among the domestic film theaters, the first-run Yucheng, Xinguang, Guolian, Huguang, etc., their program guides are different from those that exclusively show Western films: first, they have more advertisements. In addition to publishing previews of upcoming movies, they also have many store advertisements; second, they have more double pages. Since there are so many advertisements, the space has to be expanded accordingly. Before the war, three-page program guides were not uncommon in first-run theaters, but now they are hard to find; only Jin Cheng Grand Theater printed a three-page program guide when "Confucius" was showing. The program guides of Jin Cheng and Xinguang are printed in light blue, which is very pleasing to the eye. In the second-run theaters, most of them are only one page, with the movie title printed on the front and the story printed on the back. The program guide of the Mingxing Grand Theater has a continuous number printed on it, which tells us which number the movie is that is showing this year, which is quite unique.

Some of the third- and fourth-run program guides are printed on gray newspaper, the printing is poor, and there are even more typos, which makes it easy to hurt your eyes.

I think that the cast list should be printed on every program guide, otherwise it would be difficult to know who is playing whom. As for other things, the fewer the better; things like addresses, times, and phone numbers don't seem to be very necessary for audiences who have already entered the door. I believe that a concise and eye-catching exquisite program guide will definitely attract some movie fans, because in fact, there are quite a few people who put a lot of thought into collecting program guides. "Program guides" that can be read as literature readers and English readers should be made as tidy and attractive as possible!

### Anecdotes from Film City

### Brief Records of Performers in the Pear Garden

— Nanchang Beidiaoren Written, Zhang Yuzhang Illustrated

Jin Shaoshan

Jin Shaoshan is the son of Jin Xiushan. He specializes in painted faces (opera roles), and is proficient in bronze hammer roles. He is skilled in both civil and military roles, and is considered the most spectacular in black head roles. His voice is high-pitched, and his appearance is imposing, truly a perfect person in the Jing (painted face) role. At first, he stood in the South for a long time. He boarded various stages at sea, but was not valued by people, and could not achieve his aspirations. After performing with Mei Lanfang in the role of Xiang Yu in "Farewell My Concubine", his reputation soared, and from then on, he sailed smoothly and rose rapidly. He holds the top position in the painted face role in the Pear Garden. He is quite generous and good at spending money. The wages he gets from singing are often spent as soon as he gets them. He has a fondness for animals, and once raised two macaques. Occasionally seeing things he likes, regardless of their expensive price, he buys them, so he has no savings after decades of performance. Every time he performs, he does not go backstage until a few minutes before going on stage, which often causes him to miss the start of the performance. Among the actors, this gentleman is the most famous for missing the start of the performance. He currently lives in the former capital, playing the leading role with a painted face, and performing alone with a band.

Labor seeks peace of mind. How to make labor production richer and more perfect in quantity and quality is the only major problem of labor. As for personal material life, it is best for the public to make rational distribution.

Chapter 10: Gongsun's Sword Energy Appears for the First Time

It was the evening of the first day of the month. Wang Yongtai sat alone in his room, burning incense and chanting scriptures. As he was about to sleep, he suddenly felt uneasy, so he sat and pondered. In recent days, after listening to He Ji's one-sided story, he had driven away Xu Jing. He felt somewhat regretful for his rashness. He thought about how Xu Jing's behavior had always been so upright and pure. How could he, upon entering his house, have conceived such a lecherous idea? This little girl He Ji relied on his affection and acted coquettishly, often nagging in his ear. Although he sometimes didn't want to readily believe her, her clever words were so persuasive that he couldn't help but believe her. In the matter of Xu Jing, he hadn't considered it carefully, not allowing him to speak and forcibly sending him away. In the end, he had only heard one side of the story. Perhaps this matter was completely unfounded, a false accusation made by He Ji; perhaps there were other complications. Recently, He Ji had been heavily made up and seductive, clearly showing a lack of exclusive devotion to him. Because he was practicing Buddhism, he often neglected her. She was, after all, too young and probably couldn't fulfill his desires. Now that Xu Jing had left, he had no way to find him, which was his negligence. Yesterday, General Zhou had asked him about him, and he had no words to answer, only saying that he was ill and hadn't recovered. How would he cover up his lie? The more Wang Yongtai thought, the more regretful he felt. Therefore, he sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and pondered, unable to sleep for a while. The solitary lamp in the room flickered, illuminating the Buddha statue on the wall, creating a very desolate atmosphere. But little did he know that in his own bedroom, the wolfish-hearted Sang Yiqing had crept in, calling out, "Sister." He Ji had been waiting for him to come in. The weather was still hot, and both were wearing light clothing. He Ji stared intently at Sang Yiqing with her watery eyes. They smiled at each other and embraced, entering the gauze bed together. The lamplight on the table illuminated the shadows of the two people inside the bed curtains. They were venting their desires, with their backs to Wang Yongtai, unaware that a dark figure was standing quietly outside the window, with two eyes pressed against a small hole poked in the paper window, staring intently inside. Seeing the shadows in the bed, anger arose from his heart and malice from his gut. He was about to go in and punish this shameless pair of adulterers. Who was this dark figure? Of course, it was none other than Xu Jing. (74)

### Dragon Boat Festival Film Schedule Set

— Xing

The Dragon Boat Festival is one of the major festivals in the old lunar calendar. The Guopian Company attaches great importance to this. The Dragon Boat Festival program for the four first-run domestic film theaters has been scheduled. Huguang is showing "Blue Sea and Azure Sky," Jincheng is showing "Tears of Iron Window," Guolian is showing "Jiangnan Little Hero," and Xinguang is showing "Broken Heart Flower." Except for Xinguang, all are produced by China United Company, and all four are modern films. From now on, modern films will occupy an absolute advantage, and even if some costume dramas are released, they will only be a swan song.
