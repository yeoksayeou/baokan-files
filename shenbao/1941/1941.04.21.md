### Wang Zhengting Criticizes the Soviet-Japanese Agreement

Chongqing: Diplomat Dr. Wang Zhengting delivered a speech at the National Diplomacy Association yesterday, stating that the recent neutrality treaty concluded between Japan and the Soviet Union is merely a "deceptive measure" that cannot provide any permanent peace guarantees for the Soviet border and does not have a serious impact on China. Self-reliance is China's consistent diplomatic policy, and Japan has long sought to carry out its southward advance, but it does not dare to launch it rashly, leading to a direct conflict with the United States. (20th Havas Dispatch)

Chongqing: Local Chinese sources have expressed various speculations regarding the recent sudden increase in Japanese military tension in China. Some observers believe that this activity may be the result of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, while others suspect that Japan is planning a large-scale attack on Chongqing. It is widely believed that the primary objective of this decisive action by the Japanese army is to block traffic between the interior and coastal areas. In Zhejiang Province, the Japanese army is currently carrying out a three-pronged offensive on the south bank of the Qiantang River in an attempt to cut off highway and railway traffic between the coast and the interior. One route of the Japanese army, which captured Shaoxing three days ago, is continuing to advance southwest to support another route advancing along the railway line towards Zhuji. The third route of Japanese troops landed at several locations near Ningbo and is now attempting to occupy this important commercial port. According to well-informed Chinese sources, the Chinese High Command had anticipated the Japanese army's actions, and the roads and railways along the coast of Zhejiang Province have been systematically destroyed to delay the Japanese advance. Although the Chinese army does not seem to intend to defend the coastal areas, it is expected to put up a strong resistance in the interior. At the same time, fierce battles are also taking place in the Dabie Mountains in Hubei Province and the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi. News from Guangdong Province indicates that a large number of Japanese troops are concentrated in the Guangzhou area, leading some to believe that the Japanese army will launch an offensive in the Xijiang area or advance north along the Yuehan Railway. It is also reported that Japanese aircraft heavily bombed Wuzhou at the junction of Guangdong and Guangxi. Yesterday, air raid alerts were issued in Guilin, Kunming, and Changsha in the northern section of the Yuegui Railway. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

### Chongqing Three Organizations Tea Party Welcomes Belgian Ambassador

Ye Nan, the Secretary-General of the Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association, delivered a short welcome speech in French, stating that Baron Jean de Muyser had lived in China for over a decade and was a close friend of China, having made great contributions to Sino-Belgian relations. This decision to come to Chongqing led the three organizations to jointly hold a family-style gathering, preparing simple refreshments to warmly welcome him. The Belgian Ambassador then gave a reply speech, expressing his gratitude for the hospitality of the three organizations, and stating, "Although the Belgian mainland has now been occupied by German forces, the Belgian King, in order to share the joys and sorrows with his people, is determined to live and die together. We must know that Belgium still possesses the Congo colony, and the people's will to fight has never wavered. The Belgian government is currently in London engaged in various counter-offensive preparations. Today, the entire Belgian Air Force has been transferred to England to continue fighting alongside the British army." Ambassador Jean de Muyser concluded with a sincere tone, wishing China and Belgium the same final victory in their resistance and reconstruction. The Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Custody Committee held a banquet on the evening of the 19th to welcome the Belgian Ambassador. (19th Dispatch)

Editorial

### Review and Outlook on Chinese Diplomacy

China's new Foreign Minister, Mr. Guo Taiqi, departed England yesterday amidst warm congratulations and heartfelt farewells. British officials and the public alike praised him highly, saying that his appointment as Foreign Minister would undoubtedly benefit China's victory and peace. During wartime, diplomacy is a part of the nation's overall policy and a crucial key to military success or failure. We would like to take this opportunity to briefly review China's wartime diplomacy.

For the past ninety years, Chinese diplomacy has been consistently filled with humiliation and tears. However, when discussing it today, those are mostly historical relics. After the success of the Northern Expedition, the so-called revolutionary diplomacy began to unfold with a promising prospect, but in reality, it did not have much time to establish itself. It entered a new stage after the "July 7th" incident. After nearly four years of arduous fighting, China's international status and diplomatic situation have reached an unprecedented level of elevation and advantage. Objectively, this is the result of the shift in the world situation. Subjectively, it is due to the correct and strong national policy during the war, especially the steadfastness and calmness with which we have always responded, regardless of whether the international situation is favorable to us. Although there have been great efforts in winning over allies, we have never been anxious or reckless, acting like someone who has gone mad, or running around begging for pity. Instead, we have naturally achieved the effect of gaining more support because we are on the right path. This is something that every Chinese person today should feel extraordinarily gratified about.

Regarding China's wartime foreign policy, its highest principle is clearly seen in Article 3 of the Resistance and Reconstruction Program: "In the spirit of independence and autonomy, unite with countries and nations around the world that sympathize with China and jointly strive for world justice and peace." This was the case in the past and should not change in the future. Looking at the current situation, China has implicitly formed an interdependent relationship with the United States and Britain in the common anti-aggression war. The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is growing stronger over time. Even after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, their position of supporting China has not wavered in the slightest. It is expected that this common struggle between China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will continue to be promoted and enhanced to achieve the definite realization of world justice and peace. This is not because China favors Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union over Germany and Italy, but because of the attitudes and actions of the Axis powers themselves. In the past, China did not value and cherish friendship with Germany and Italy, but recently there has only been regret and lament. Any other country that takes the same steps as Germany and Italy will also lose China's friendship. On the other hand, China's friendship with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is entirely based on their sympathy for China and its struggle for world justice and peace. Although there have always been some differences in viewpoints and actions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the whole of international relations, thus forming a major deficiency in today's world politics and even leading to some unpleasant facts, in terms of supporting China, the positions and measures of both sides are absolutely consistent, and Chinese diplomacy pays equal attention to both without any preference. Mr. Guo Taiqi, in his speech before leaving England, stated that in the great era of post-war world reorganization, his first thought was ABC, namely America, Britain, and China; and that he often felt that the stronger the Soviet Union's friendship and assistance to China, the more the restoration of peace in Asia and the world could be expected. Combining these two statements, it is sufficient to prove that Mr. Guo's personal beliefs and aspirations are completely in line with China's consistent foreign policy. Therefore, it is all the more clear that this change of personnel in the position of Foreign Minister will not have any impact on policy.

However, unchanging policy is one thing, and enhancing work efficiency is another. In the past four years and more, Dr. Wang Chonghui, with his venerable experience, entered the wartime foreign affairs machinery and prepared for hard work. The aforementioned achievements in Chinese diplomacy are undoubtedly due in large part to the efforts of the diplomatic authorities; but in terms of flexible response, there were sometimes slight shortcomings, which need not be denied. In the future, the international situation will become more and more difficult, and China's war will also approach the decisive stage. The difficulties of future foreign operations will naturally be many times greater than in the past. Mr. Guo has been stationed in Britain for a long time, residing in the heart of the world's diplomatic hub, and has experienced countless adversities and dangers from the heyday of the League of Nations to the protraction of the European War. His experience and grasp of the subtle shifts in international affairs and the timely application of diplomacy are naturally more profound than those who have lived in the country for a long time. The great expectations that the British government and public have placed on Mr. Guo are shared by Chinese and foreign people alike. However, diplomatic issues not only rely on the correctness of the policy and the right people to implement it, but also on the strength and status of the entire country. Although Talleyrand was able to preserve France's glory after defeat at the Congress of Vienna, diplomatic talents such as Beneš and Titulescu were ultimately unable to save the unfortunate fate of Czechoslovakia and Romania. We have high hopes for Chinese diplomacy in the future, and we also sincerely hope that China can make balanced progress in politics, military affairs, economics, and other aspects, so as to cooperate with this unprecedentedly good diplomatic situation.

### The US and Canada Strengthen North Pacific Defenses According to the Joint Defense Plan; Air Force Bases Are Being Actively Constructed in Many Places

(20th International News Service Dispatch)

Washington: The Navy Department yesterday appointed Admiral Greenslade as commander of the 12th Naval District, succeeding Rear Admiral Hepburn, who has been assigned to the office of the Secretary of the Navy. (20th Associated Press Dispatch)

Washington Naval Dispatch: Previously, when the US Senate and House of Representatives were discussing the appropriation of $400 million to strengthen naval and air bases in Guam and Samoa in the Pacific and in the British territories ceded to the US in the Atlantic, the US and Canadian federal land, sea, and air force authorities had already engaged in a large-scale construction plan to strengthen the strategic position of the two countries from Washington State to Alaska. The Canadian Federation has already begun to construct multiple air force bases in the area from Edmonton and Vancouver to Alaska, in accordance with the recommendations made by the US-Canada Joint Defense Committee. At the same time, the United States is spending $50 million to strengthen defenses along the Alaskan coast. For example, on Annette Island, several thousand people have begun construction of an air force base capable of accommodating giant bombers and establishing a link between the United States and Angolaki Port. Angolaki Port has become the largest US air force base in the Pacific over the past six months. Just in the case of the Lee Hutchinson Battery alone, the total number of air force infantry and artillery troops is no less than several thousand. In addition, there are two major bases, one being Women's Bay on Kodiak Island, and the other being Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands. The US Navy Department is currently constructing defense projects in these two locations and wants to build a second Pearl Harbor in the Aleutian Islands. In addition, the Canadian Federation is actively strengthening defenses along the North Pacific coast, setting up artillery batteries in the Rocky Mountain region and building eight air force bases in Grand Prairie, Saint John, Nelson, Prince George, Smithers, Whitehorse and other places north of Edmonton Harbor. In this way, once the Pacific War breaks out, Canadian and American fighter squadrons will be able to quickly fly to Alaska to be on guard. Moreover, when the aforementioned airfields are completed in the future, they will be fully equipped and capable of handling the take-off and landing of giant aircraft. (Havas Agency)

### Japanese Rumors of Soviet Far East Army Moving to European Front; Temporary Ban on Foreigners Traveling in Soviet Territory May Be a Sign of Troop Movement

Tokyo: The Nichinichi Shimbun today published a report from Manchuria stating that the Soviet Union may be moving its Far East army to the European front. The report said that the Soviet Union's ban on foreigners traveling from April 17 to May 3 indicates that a portion of the Soviet Far East army may be moving to the European front. It was learned here yesterday that all travel permits through the Soviet Union will be temporarily canceled from April 17 to May 3 (the German Consulate in Shanghai has also issued a similar announcement). The Nichinichi Shimbun also said that the movement of Soviet troops may represent the Soviet Union's decision to take advantage of the new Soviet-Japanese agreement and the needs of the European war. Therefore, it had no choice but to take this action. (20th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Matsuoka Yosuke Arrives in Manchuria; Scheduled to Fly Back to Tokyo Tomorrow

Tokyo: When Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka arrived in Manchuria today, he told Japanese reporters that he had no hope of signing a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union before his second visit to Moscow. He said, "This treaty was truly beyond my most pleasant expectations." He also said that once negotiations began, the treaty was completed within ten minutes. According to a report received today from Manchuria, Matsuoka explained that Moscow was not included in his original itinerary, but he stopped there to visit Stalin and Molotov, with the original intention of thanking them for the warm hospitality of the Soviet authorities. Unexpectedly, this led to the conclusion of the Neutrality Treaty. A Japanese source in Manchuria said that Matsuoka strongly defended the (Chinese Treaty), saying that it was not, as foreign commentators claimed, beneficial to the Soviet Union and detrimental to Japan. Matsuoka will travel from Manchuria to Hailar, and then fly to Dalian. He is scheduled to fly to Tokyo from Dalian on Tuesday. (20th Associated Press Dispatch)

### The Atlantic War Will Be a Decisive Factor; The Next Four Months Are a Critical Juncture; Britain Is Confident of Achieving Final Victory

London: British Admiral Chatfield said in a speech in Torbay yesterday: "In this terrifying struggle against the European beast, what we have are the War for Britain, the War for the Atlantic, and the Wars for the Middle East and the Mediterranean. All are extremely important, but the first and second wars are especially critical. Hitler's only chance to defeat Britain lies in the Atlantic War, so the Atlantic is Britain's most important battlefield. I am confident that we can hold out to the end. With our skills and experience, I know that Britain will be able to solve the shipping problem as it did in the last great war." (20th Reuters Dispatch)

London: British Labour Minister Bevin said in a speech in Birmingham yesterday that the period from today to July is Britain's most critical period. We must hold on for the next four months. From then on, the growing advantage will definitely belong to Britain. We now have a chance to win the night air raids before the next winter, and there is reason to believe that British science has reached the point where it can defeat night raids. However, the public must be warned not to rush to say that there is no danger of Britain being invaded. We must still prepare for the enemy to invade. I urge the labor sector to find ways to maintain production seven days a week. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

### Reactions to Churchill's Remarks in Germany and Italy

Berlin: Regarding British Prime Minister Churchill's statement that Germany would bomb Cairo and Athens, using it as a pretext to threaten to bomb Rome, responsible officials here have dismissed it as nonsense, saying that the German army is fighting in North Africa and is not attacking Egyptian territory or the Egyptian people.

At the same time, Germany has no intention of threatening to bomb Athens. (20th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Rome: Regarding British Prime Minister Churchill's threat to bomb Rome, political figures here have refused to comment on it, considering it to be the absurd theory of a British politician.

### Greece Organizes Military Cabinet, Vows to Fight to the End

Military and Political Power Concentrated in the King, Machalaque Appointed Cabinet Assistant

Athens - General Machalaque, a renowned Greek military strategist and member of the Liberal Party, was appointed today as Deputy Prime Minister of Greece. While German forces were heavily bombarding the Allied defense lines, King George III of Greece took over the highest military and political power due to the death of Prime Minister Koryzis. King George held meetings all night Friday with government leaders, and by Saturday morning, he had already appointed Kotzias as Deputy Prime Minister. However, Kotzias resigned after only a few hours in office, citing that under the current situation, a fully military government seemed more necessary. There are currently various strong indications to prove that Koryzis' death was due to suicide out of concern for the war against Germany and Italy. Deputy Prime Minister Kotzias issued a statement to the army, stating that the new national government would definitely continue to fight until victory. It is believed here that Kotzias' failure to form a new cabinet by noon yesterday indicates that a military government will soon be established. Observers say that the King's decision regarding the organization of the new government is sufficient to ensure absolute unity at the most critical moment in Greece, and this decision is also the most effective guarantee on the road to fighting to the end. At the same time, the strong resistance of the Allied forces in various mountain passes has created an atmosphere of excitement on the streets of Athens. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

Turkish Capital - Official sources here have praised the reorganization of the Greek cabinet and the concentration of power in the King, saying that, following the sudden death of Prime Minister Koryzis, the developments in the Greek political situation prove that the country will continue to resist. As for the landing of British troops in Basra, southern Iraq, it is considered a timely move. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

People of Athens Calm as Usual, Former Premier's Death Due to Suicide

Athens - It was learned last night that former Greek Prime Minister Koryzis committed suicide on Friday due to extreme anxiety about the tense military situation. The funeral was held yesterday afternoon at the Athens Cathedral, with the honors befitting a deceased Prime Minister in office. King George II of Greece, members of the royal family, government officials, and members of the diplomatic corps all came to pay their respects. Acting Prime Minister Kotzias delivered a eulogy, and many people watched along the way. Although the situation is serious and the Prime Minister has passed away, the people remain calm. According to Ankara Radio, Koryzis' sudden death is a terrible blow to Greece, which has achieved amazing victories in the struggle for freedom and independence. Everyone must die, but what will not die is the land of the motherland, which has been soaked in the blood of the Greeks. Greece will eventually survive. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Fierce Fighting on All Fronts in Greece, British-Greek Allied Forces Hold New Positions, Counterattack in Macedonia Inflicts Heavy Damage on the Enemy

London - A communique issued at 5 pm yesterday stated that after the British forces in Greece withdrew to new defense lines on Friday, they resolutely resisted repeated fierce attacks by German forces and remained unshaken. The location of this new defense line has not been announced, but according to German reports, it appears to be thirty miles south of Mount Olympus. The British rearguard repelled attacks by German armored units and infantry, allowing the main British forces to safely withdraw without losses. Although the Germans have captured Larissa and Mount Olympus, the Allied resistance everywhere remains extremely formidable. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

Cairo - A recent communique from the British General Headquarters here announced that Greek and British Imperial forces are continuing to retreat, covered by rear guard units. These rear guard units, due to their prompt action and courageous combat, have halted the German advance and inflicted military damage. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

London - According to recent battle reports from the northern Greek front, although the intense German offensive has not diminished slightly, the British and Greek forces are still holding all their positions and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The Greek army has officially announced that the transfer of its troops has not been hindered. The Australian and New Zealand troops on the right wing have not only repelled the Germans but have also launched fierce counterattacks repeatedly. A Reuters correspondent stationed in northern Greece reported that the German forces around Mount Olympus are now being blocked in the positions they occupied three days ago. A Greek military communique stated that during the transfer of troops, they repeatedly attacked German forces attempting to harass them, inflicting heavy damage. Yesterday, there was fierce fighting in the Akilocastron area of Albania, and the Greek army killed many enemies. At the same time, the British Air Force continued to bomb enemy transportation lines and convoys today. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Athens - A communique stated that although the weather was poor on Friday, the British Air Force continued to launch continuous attacks on enemy transportation lines and troops. Many bombs fell and exploded in enemy transportation concentrations. British fighters also conducted offensive patrols, and two aircraft did not return. Last night, Athens Radio reported that the Greek army launched a fierce counterattack on a key point in the center of the Macedonian front line, north of Calabaka. The German army could not withstand it and retreated backward. The Greek army was greatly excited by this victory, because the German army there attempted to break through the mountain range and reach the plains of central Greece. The Greek army put great pressure on this German route, so the German army had to retreat after the Greek counterattack. The news from the front on Saturday was gratifying. The German army suffered heavy losses, and German soldiers were killed and wounded everywhere on the Macedonian battlefield. The British, Australian, and New Zealand forces have achieved victories in repelling attacking German forces and counterattacking German forces every day, causing the German army to be disturbed and uneasy. Within Albanian territory, Italian attacks continue to be defeated. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Berlin - According to the German military headquarters, the German army has occupied Mount Olympus in Greece, which is three thousand meters above sea level. The mountain is fortified with strong fortresses and occupies an extremely important military position. The enemy forces are stubbornly resisting and refusing to retreat, so every inch of land must be exchanged for blood and flesh. The city of Larissa, an important supply station for the British army, has also been occupied by the German army. With the occupation of this city, the port of Volos on the eastern coast of Greece is threatened. In the past four days, German aircraft have sunk 84,000 tons of British ships in Greek ports. Twenty ships have been hit and caught fire. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

### Premier of Southern Country Declares Continued Struggle for Freedom, Heartbroken Words on Military Collapse After Peaceful Nation Suffers Invasion

Athens - Southern Prime Minister Simovic issued a statement regarding recent events, saying that what we are facing is an unequal war. We have no illusions about the final outcome. Although we know that defeating such a strong enemy is impossible, we all know that any war involving the defense of our integrity and independence must be accepted by us. However, the duration of resistance is the only question. We had hoped that the war could be sustained for a long time, but the technical preparedness of the Southern Army is far inferior to that of the enemy, and our allied countries, although with great ambitions, cannot quickly come to our aid. We had hoped to establish a defense line along the new front line after being attacked and abandoning the territory of eastern Serbia, but the sudden advance of the German army towards Zagreb made the situation in Croatia even more difficult, and foreign party members, protected by German armored troops, occupied Zagreb and established their so-called independent Croatian government. However, he must declare that Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes are all fighting bravely. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Ankara - Turkish newspapers have all commented at length on the Balkan war situation, generally saying that the reasons for Yugoslavia's failure are nothing more than three points: (1) the nation failed to unite as one; (2) the entire military force failed to fully mobilize; and (3) the people failed to be spiritually prepared. However, after the outbreak of war, Serbian patriots were able to serve their country loyally, which is particularly admirable. The "Ulus" newspaper also reported that the disintegration of the Yugoslav nation is only a military victory for Germany, and it has gained almost nothing economically. The recent concentration of British warships in the port of Gibraltar and the holding of meetings by various generals in the port are all precursors to major British actions in the Mediterranean. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### North African Front, British Forces Attack, Army, Navy, and Air Force Cooperate to Maintain Initiative

Cairo - British Imperial forces are still maintaining their initiative in Libya, and the British Air Force's bombing and fighter planes, along with the Australian Air Force, are not allowing the enemy any respite. Aircraft are active from morning to night, low-flying bombing German concentrations, and have destroyed hundreds of tanks.

### German-Turkish Relations, Papen Returns Home for Consultation, Arousing Attention from All Parties

Berlin - Regarding the return of the German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, to Berlin, German officials are still keeping silent. Some say that Papen is already in Germany and has met with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, but the location is unknown. Because Papen has recently consulted with Turkish authorities many times, his arrival is regarded as extremely important by the outside world. Neutral observers believe that at this time of tense international situation, Papen's return to the German capital cannot be regarded as ordinary. However, the claim that Germany and Turkey have signed a non-aggression and friendship treaty seems to be premature. Well-informed German sources say that there will be no surprising events in the near future. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

### German Special Envoy Goes to Near East, Conducts Consolidation Activities, British Troops Land in Iraq, Breaking Nazi Illusions of Seizing Oil Fields

Turkish Capital - German special envoy Schabel,奉命前來近東活動, has arrived here. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

Constantinople - It is confirmed that the British decision to occupy the port of Basra in Iraq is to eliminate Germany's plan to invade the Near East. Germany's attempt to seize the Near East is actively preparing to promote revolution in Arabia and secretly transport cash and military equipment to support it. Its purpose is to directly seize the oil in Persia and Iraq, taking a route through Turkey, Egypt, or the Soviet Union. The leader of German political activities in Arabia is a former Muslim judge in Jerusalem who was the leader of the Arab National Party in Palestine. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

London - British newspapers today have welcomed the landing of British troops in Basra, Iraq, to protect the transportation line to Iraq, considering it a farsighted step. The Sunday Dispatch reported that the British action is precautionary, and it is essential to protect important supplies and maintain contact with the garrison in Egypt. The Times said that this supply route may become extremely important for Turkey, as Turkey urgently desires various forms of assistance from Britain in times of emergency. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

London - People here now recognize that the arrival of powerful British forces in Basra, 300 miles southeast of Baghdad, is a British move to strengthen its defenses in the Near East. Iraq has many oil fields and is a military fortress in the Middle East, easily occupied by German paratroopers and airborne troops. Military observers also recalled that during the German operations in Norway, they used giant aircraft to transport troops. People here are all aware that the recent coup in Iraq has caused great suspicion on the part of Britain. Although officials have repeatedly stated that the Anglo-Iraqi treaty will be fully respected, the suspicion has not been completely dispelled. The arrival of British troops in the country is due to Britain's suspicion of Iraq's position. It is generally believed that the British troops who have already landed are sufficient for Britain to protect its main interests and resist German attacks when necessary. Britain is concerned about Iraq due to the following three important facts: (1) Iraq produces 4 million tons of oil annually, which is transported via pipelines through the Syrian desert to Haifa; (2) If Iraq joins the Axis, the southern corner of Turkey will lose its protection and will affect the diplomatic attitudes of Turkey, Syria, and others; (3) Iraq occupies an important position on the British air route to India and the Persian Gulf. It is expected that the arrival of British troops in Iraq will protect Turkey's southern flank and support Ankara's position on the Balkan war, and it can prevent Germany from reliving its old dream of building a road from Berlin to Baghdad 50 years ago.

### Hundreds of German Aircraft Launch Large-Scale Raids on England All Night, Bombs Fall Like Rain Over London, Heavy Material and Human Losses

London - Last night and this morning, hundreds of German aircraft twice attacked London fiercely. Huge super bombs fell like rain, but the number of damages and casualties has not yet been announced. The ferocity of the German aircraft's attack was almost on par with the terrible lightning attack of last Wednesday, but at 4 am, the sky suddenly turned dark, the clouds and fog were dense, and the anti-aircraft fire was very fierce, so the raiders had no choice but to withdraw. The first air raid began shortly after dusk. Countless German bombers attacked London, dropping high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs for two hours, and then flew away. But two hours later, they flew back again. During the lull in the air raid, rescue teams worked hard to excavate the ruins of a certain air-raid shelter, as people feared that many women were buried in the rubble there. (International dispatch, 20th)

London - An official Air Ministry communiqué stated that the air raid on London last night was quite fierce, with very heavy losses and many casualties. Several places outside London were also bombed, with the most damage occurring in the eastern and southeastern counties. There was slight damage, but the casualties were not significant. It is heard that two enemy bombers have been shot down. Last night, on the eve of Hitler's birthday, German planes fiercely attacked London. Just as darkness fell, many batches of German bombers circled back and forth in the cloudy sky, dropping many incendiary and high-explosive bombs, which only ended before dawn. The dense anti-aircraft fire on the ground in London prevented the German planes from flying low. At that time, the fire brigades quickly extinguished the fires to prevent them from becoming targets for later German planes, which was a great achievement. One of London's most magnificent cathedrals has been burned down, and the fire was visible from miles away. In addition, another church, four hospitals, two museums, a public hall, and a school were hit. A London fire station was directly hit, and the number of deaths is feared to be high. The German official news agency said that this was another act of revenge for the British air raid on Berlin. According to German propaganda, the Thames Estuary, the Royal Albert Docks area, and Greenwich were heavily bombed. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Parliament Building Hit by Bomb

London - The British Houses of Parliament were hit again in the recent air raid, and the residence of Speaker of the House of Commons Fitzroy was also hit, but the Speaker was not in the room at the time and was not injured. Many of the glass windows in the House of Commons library have been shattered, and the servants' quarters have also been destroyed, but the debating chamber is said to be unharmed.

Mountain of Gifts

Berlin - Hitler spent his 52nd birthday today at the forward command post somewhere in southeastern Europe. Gifts from all over the world poured in, sent to Hitler's chancellery. Most of the gifts came from within Germany, but there were also quite a few from the United States, South America, Bulgaria, Romania, Sweden, and Norway. One oil painting, dated December 10, 1940, was mailed from the United States and has now arrived, apparently approved for passage by British inspectors. There were also many foods such as coffee, cocoa, and tea, which will be forwarded to charities or military hospitals. German各地 were ordered by Propaganda Minister Goebbels to hold celebrations, and all buildings across the country were decorated with flags. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

### Longstanding Friendship Between China and Thailand, Broadcasting of Unfavorable News Clearly Intended to Cause Harm

Chongqing - Regarding the recent news from Bangkok that the Chinese government discriminates against Thailand and that the Chongqing Radio Station is broadcasting unfavorable news about Thailand, the reporter inquired about the situation from a responsible person in the Central Overseas Department. According to the discussion, the rumored details are not true and are clearly intended to cause harm. Although there are no formal diplomatic relations between China and Thailand, the Chinese and Thai nations have always been friendly and have extremely close relations in terms of history, geography, economy, and bloodline. Thailand's request to recover lost territory is a matter between Thailand and Annam and has nothing to do with China. In short, there are currently a large number of overseas Chinese in Thailand, and we should hope that Thailand is peaceful so that overseas Chinese can live and work in peace and promote Thailand's prosperity. As early as December of the 28th year of the Republic of China, Thai Prime Minister Fu Zongcai电 also guaranteed that the Thai government would properly protect overseas Chinese in Thailand. The Chinese government and people were very pleased to hear this expression of friendship. Today, we hope that there will be further connections between China and Thailand, because China today is fighting to safeguard peace in East Asia and establish world peace, and Thailand today is a peace-loving country. The Chongqing International Radio Station's increase in Thai-language broadcasting programs is precisely to promote Sino-Thai sentiment and bridge the gap between China and Thailand. Therefore, we firmly believe that those who deliberately fabricate facts and deliberately undermine Sino-Thai sentiment must have other intentions that are unfavorable to the two nations of China and Thailand.

### US Aid to Britain Plan Intensifies

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday hosted newspaper reporters and stated in a speech that the situations in Greece and Egypt are quite serious, so the US government has to conduct further research on the plan to aid Britain. Observers here generally believe that the war in Egypt is extremely important and can determine the future of the current European war in comparison to the war in Greece. According to the US official opinion, if the British and Egyptian allied forces can prevent the German and Italian troops from directly approaching the Suez Canal, then the United States can transport weapons to Britain via the Red Sea, as President Roosevelt recently announced the Red Sea as a "non-war zone," allowing US merchant ships to freely enter and exit the Suez Canal.

### Rumors Emerge from the Board of Directors Regarding Amendments to Land Regulations; Special Taxpayer Meeting Imminent; Annual Election System Potentially to Be Abolished

The *North-China Daily News* reports that the outgoing Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council for 1940 is rumored to be proposing a suggestion to the interim Board of Directors that may abolish the annual election system and the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers. It is believed that if this suggestion is accepted, a special taxpayer meeting will be convened to pass amendments to the Land Regulations.

Potential Abolition of Election System

These amendments are of such importance that they surpass any changes since Captain Balfour and the Chinese Daotai first established the settlement ninety-five years ago. Even more significant is the fact that since 1870, it has been customary to elect the Board of Directors every April. This system may now be abolished. The Board of Directors of 1865 was also not elected by the taxpayer meeting, but was established by a motion from Keswick (grandfather of the former Chairman Keswick).

Few Foreigners Spend Their Entire Lives Here

Since Shanghai was opened as a trading port, it has been a center of commerce. Those who come here to do business often return home fully loaded after a considerable period. Very few spend their entire lives here. According to the oldest records, the Municipal Council staff had requested salary increases due to high living expenses early on, but the so-called high living expenses at that time were not as severe as they are now. At that time, the monthly salary of the Inspector-General of the Shanghai Municipal Police was $150, which was later reduced to $100 because it was generally considered too high. As for the constables, their salary was only $30 per month.

Almost Endowed with Dictatorial Powers

According to the aforementioned proposal, it was impossible to verify yesterday due to it being Sunday. However, if this suggestion is accepted, the special taxpayer meeting this year has already authorized the interim Board of Directors, whose term shall not be less than one year, to consider, within its term, a municipal system that is more satisfactory than that stipulated by the current Land Regulations for the residents of the Public Concession and the representatives of relevant countries. In this case, the interim Board of Directors would almost be endowed with dictatorial powers, which is something that Chinese and foreign citizens should not ignore.

### Public Concession Electricity Consumption Already Reduced; Company Thanks Users for Cooperation

The Shanghai Power Company previously appealed to the public to conserve electricity and overcome the difficult times together, as the supply of coal was difficult to ensure in sufficient quantities. A reporter yesterday visited a senior official of the Power Company, who stated that the company's appeal had received some response from users. The company's weekly electricity production had fallen from approximately 15.9 million kilowatt-hours to 14.3 million kilowatt-hours. In other words, users' consumption of electricity has been reduced by

Ten Percent

The official also stated that this amount of reduction is still far from the company's expected target, but it is already encouraging and exciting. It was also revealed that the company can still transport 125,000 tons of coal per month, while the coal consumption reaches 50,000 tons. The shortfall is made up from stockpiles. Due to the lack of ships, the hope of increasing the coal supply to the port seems very slim. The company's suggestion that users reduce electricity by 30% is only a temporary measure. The Municipal Council has appointed a committee to study reducing the current supply of electricity,

Accurate Measures

To be implemented. According to unofficial sources, the committee may consider the importance of various industries, determine which are necessary and which are secondary, and then ask secondary industrial manufacturers to cooperate and reduce electricity consumption. However, this issue is quite complicated, because once the electricity supply to these factories is reduced, it will result in the dismissal of workers and lead to a new labor problem. The reporter asked the company official about the rumors that the company would restrict the use of neon lights. The response was that he did not believe there would be much reduction, because the electricity used by neon lights is

Quite Small

Its impact is not significant. As for whether to cancel the smallest amount of electricity meter users, it is still under consideration. According to a company official, this is a most difficult problem, because the company has spent a lot of money to install equipment for users, and of course hopes to be compensated. This whole problem is still under consideration.

### The War Situation in Eastern Zhejiang is Increasingly Tense; Large Chinese Forces Rush to the Coast, People's Hearts are Still Stable; Postal and Telegraph Services Are Still Maintained as Usual

Since the war situation in eastern Zhejiang has become increasingly tense, Zhejiang provincial organizations in Shanghai are very concerned and have wired Zhejiang to inquire about the details. However, postal and telegraph services between Shanghai and eastern Zhejiang are still being maintained. Details are recorded as follows:

Stable War Situation on the Coast of Eastern Zhejiang

According to sources from Zhejiang provincial organizations in Shanghai, the Japanese army landed in Zhenhai at 3:00 a.m. on the 19th, and another force landed near Shipu Town in Xiangshan County and Haimen at the mouth of the Ou River. A fierce battle ensued. Large Chinese forces have now rushed to Linhai, so the war situation is expected to stabilize. Japanese planes have been continuously bombing Shipu, Haimen, and other places since the 16th. A telegram from Ningbo yesterday stated, "The Japanese army has landed in Zhenhai and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. The situation in Ningbo has become stronger, and people's hearts are very calm."

Postal, Telegraph, and Remittance Services Maintained as Usual

Zhenhai was previously captured by Japanese warships under the cover of aircraft and artillery on July 16 last year in Jiangnan, but was recovered in just two days. Therefore, it is generally believed that the future of the war situation this time will be optimistic. According to reporters from the Datong News Agency who inquired with various telegraph offices such as Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific in this port, telegrams to and from eastern Zhejiang are currently being sent and received as usual. However, if there is an accident and delivery is impossible, the bureau cannot be held responsible. The Shanghai Postal Administration is still maintaining postal and remittance services as usual, but whether they can arrive safely depends on the situation at the time due to shipping disruptions.

The Situation in Shaoxing is Extremely Chaotic

Regarding the war situation in Shaoxing, since the Japanese army in Xiaoshan suddenly invaded in multiple directions on the 17th, fierce fighting is expected to have occurred in the Keqiao and Qianqing areas. The fighting in the suburbs of the city is still fierce, and all agencies and organizations have moved to the countryside to work. The Shaoxing Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai wired Yuyao on the 19th to inquire, but has not yet received a reply, only that the situation in the city is extremely chaotic, and residents' belongings have been moved to the countryside.

### At a Time of Soaring Prices, Ad Valorem Tax Collection

The Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association and the Chinese Cotton Mill Association previously requested that the Ministry of Finance abandon the idea of ​​using ad valorem tax collection. It is now heard that the Ministry of Finance has replied by telegram, stating, "Received your telegram. After investigation, tax rate revisions should be adapted to the times. Current unified tax rates include those collected in the past, those collected ad valorem, and those collected both ad valorem and volumetrically. At this time of soaring prices, in order to equalize the burden and enrich the treasury, this Ministry should adjust the price differences and revise the dutiable prices of unified tax commodities at any time to suit market conditions. The proposal by the association to quickly abandon ad valorem tax collection should not be discussed. Please be informed. Ministry of Finance Yu Tax Bing Hao Seal."

### American Community Celebrates Foreign Trade Day

The American Association has issued a notice to all American citizens in Shanghai stating that May 11 is Mother's Day, May 22 is International Maritime Day, and May 30 is Memorial Day. American citizens in Shanghai should fly flags in commemoration on each of these memorial days. If lapel pins are needed, they can also be obtained from the American Association. Reporters have also learned that the American Foreign Trade Week will begin on May 19, and American officials and businessmen in Shanghai will hold celebrations.

### P. L. Pruthi Expresses His Aspirations

The *Continental Daily News* reports that P. L. Pruthi, the founder of the World Alliance Movement, has had extensive travel experience, circling the globe five or six times. He has visited almost every capital city in the world. According to him, the purpose of his travels is "to seek a shortcut to liberate his motherland (India)." He met with Kaiser Wilhelm in 1915, Lenin in 1919, and traveled in China and Japan from 1922 to 1923. In 1929, he published the first "World Alliance Movement" publication in Berlin. He considers himself a servant of humanity. He said, "People should first seek psychological peace and then world peace."

### The Four Shanghai Banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong May Resume Operations in the Short Term; The Four Head Offices Are Negotiating Solutions in Hong Kong

After the four Shanghai banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong suspended operations last Thursday, they jointly telegraphed Chongqing and Hong Kong to report. It is now learned that a reply telegram has been received from the four head offices in Hong Kong. The gist is that they received the telegram from Minister Kong Jian, knowing that the two items of the Shanghai four banks have been investigated. The shooting of Zhang was examined and found to be revenge due to private grievances, and had nothing to do with our side. The tragic shooting of a colleague at the China Bank is especially regrettable. It is hoped that the deceased will be given a good funeral first, and a separate case will be reported to the government for commendation. The injured should be given emergency treatment and the families should be comforted. However, the details of the colleague's death at the China Bank should still be investigated and reported. In recent years, the banks in Shanghai have continued to maintain operations in order to take care of the interests of compatriots in the southeastern provinces and the convenience of Chinese and foreign merchants. Now that the Concession authorities do not provide sufficient protection and the lives of colleagues are in danger at any time, the reported suspension of operations can be forgiven. It is still hoped that the circumstances and facts of all parties will be carefully considered, and the resumption of operations and future response measures will be discussed and submitted for approval, etc. Please follow the procedures. As for the resumption of operations and future response measures, the four head offices in the mountains will consult and report again. After receiving the telegram from the Shanghai four banks, they are waiting quietly for the telegram from the four head offices. However, the Shanghai market has been extremely inconvenienced since the suspension of operations of the four banks. Leaders of various commercial organizations are doing their best to appeal. Once negotiations are completed and the Chongqing and Hong Kong replies arrive, operations can be resumed in the short term.

### The Recent Price Limits on Rice Will Not Be Relaxed Again; The Under-the-Table Premiums Must Not Continue to Exist; Adulteration or Reduction of Quantity Should Be Investigated

According to sources from relevant parties, last weekend, the responsible authorities of the Public Concession Municipal Council convened a meeting to consult rice merchants on opinions regarding improving the rice market. It is said that the crux of the rising rice prices is mostly the hoarding of spot goods by speculators. Of the million or so bags of spot goods currently in this city, at least 700,000 bags or more are in the hands of speculators. Only

Two Hundred Thousand Bags

Are in circulation on the market. The authorities then inquired whether it would be possible to add a reasonable profit to the purchase price of the rice and persuade them to sell. The rice merchants said that this might be feasible, but the work of investigating speculators is not easy, and these people have a large amount of floating capital, so they do not have to rush to sell and wait for a good price. According to general speculation, the authorities will, in the future, use measures to suppress rice prices, in addition to making every effort to dredge sources of supply, and set laws to prevent speculators from hoarding spot goods. The authorities have conducted meticulous research on limiting the market prices of rice and miscellaneous grains before now, and all parties believe that the prices set now allow the rice merchants who hold goods to obtain

Substantial Profits

Which would definitely not cause losses to these rice merchants. Furthermore, domestic and foreign sources are surging, and the bottom of Chinese and foreign rice warehouses are filled. When the time comes, rice merchants can be called upon to sell, and rice prices will no longer continue to rise. However, since the announcement and implementation of the price limits, under-the-table transactions such as market premiums have revived. Now, the authorities are paying close attention to such bad behavior in the rice market. All the various price limits that have been set will not be relaxed again. It is heard that they are actively carrying out concrete measures to punish rice market brokers, and will not allow illegal transactions such as under-the-table premiums in the rice market to continue to exist, and will try to severely crack down on them. They have ordered detectives in the location to pay close attention. If they find anyone exceeding the price limits and privately doing under-the-table deals, they will be arrested and prosecuted according to the law. They have also deeply warned the detectives not to use this as an excuse to extort legitimate rice merchants, and not to engage in favoritism or corruption. If any are discovered, they will be severely punished without leniency.

### Chinese Medicine Industry Demands Improved Treatment

There are more than 500 Chinese medicine shops in this port. Business was sluggish before the war, but business has flourished since the war. The income of employees is extremely low. Ordinary employees earn between four and more than ten yuan per month. Senior employees, such as assistant managers, earn more than thirty yuan per month, which is extremely rare. Since the outbreak of the war, living expenses, especially in Zhejiang Province, have been three times higher than in Shanghai. Therefore, employees of drugstores in Shanghai, although employers have slightly increased subsidies, are only twenty or thirty yuan, barely surviving. Recently, representatives from the labor side have made a request to the employer to increase salaries threefold and give five dou of white rice per month. After negotiations between labor and management, no results were achieved. The labor side stated that if the employer cannot accept the request, they will not be able to survive. The employer believes that if they accept the request, they will not be able to operate. Both sides are going to extremes. It is hoped that both labor and management will be open and honest, and consider solutions so as not to expand the situation and repeat the mistakes of Xu Chongdao.

Wage Increase Solved for Carpentry Industry

The carpentry and sawing workers of construction factories requested a wage increase due to difficult living conditions. The industry announced a wage increase: nine jiao for carpentry, eight jiao for water work, and two jiao and five fen for apprentices. The workers were not satisfied and a strike broke out, as reported in previous newspapers. Now, after calling all parties to mediate, it has been decided to increase carpentry by another one jiao to one yuan per day, water work by another one jiao to nine jiao per day, and apprentices by another five fen to three jiao per day. It should be uniformly resumed today.

Cinema Employees Make Four Demands

Since the resumption of business of cinemas in this city, business is booming and seat prices have been increased several times. The income of employees is meager. It is now unanimously decided to request the employer to increase salaries and benefits as follows:

(1) Those with original salaries below ten yuan will receive an additional 150%, those between 150 yuan and 200 yuan will receive an additional 10%. A discretionary increase will be given across nine levels. (2) Subsidies will be issued at 100% of the post-raise wage. (3) If the rice price exceeds 130 yuan, the demand to increase subsidies must be retained. (4) Working hours are limited to nine hours.

Eyeglass Workers' Resumption Conditions

The strike of eyeglass grinding workers in this city has been going on for two weeks. The Concession authorities have taken on the role of mediator, advising both labor and management in the industry. Progress has been very smooth. It is now heard that the labor-management dispute in the industry has been completely resolved. The full text of the conditions is as follows: (1) Starting from April 1, 1941, based on the current price of 120 yuan for No. 2 Saigon rice (the price on the day of mediation), the employer will issue a living subsidy of 21 yuan in national currency per month to each worker. However, employers who voluntarily provide a living subsidy exceeding this amount are not subject to this limit. Subsequently, for every ten yuan that the rice price exceeds, the employer will increase the living subsidy by three yuan. (2) Apprentices who have been on the job for more than one year will receive a living subsidy of five yuan in national currency. (3) Holiday regulations will still be in accordance with the original practices of each company. (4) Workers or apprentices who stop working outside of the prescribed holidays will have their living subsidy deducted on a daily basis. (5) Neither labor nor management may resign without cause. (6) Workers should resume work immediately.

### Coal Stockpiles Reach 450,000 Tons; Speculators Are Already Anxious; Prices Will Plummet If There Is No Price Gouging; Buyers Gradually Decrease as Weather Turns Hot

Since the speculative coal brokers in the Shanghai market have repeatedly used their skills, the market situation has been extremely chaotic. The sales price of smoke-white coal has risen steadily, and the market has reached a situation where there is a market but no goods. The authorities of the two concessions, in view of the rising coal prices, which are related to the livelihoods of ordinary people, have tried to rent a number of ocean-going vessels, specifically for loading foreign coal to Shanghai, in order to increase spot goods in the market and stabilize the coal industry. The effect is now gradually becoming apparent. The details are recorded as follows:

Surging Sources

Reporters from the *New Life News Agency* learned from various coal industry organizations that the amount of smoke-white coal blocks and chips transported to Shanghai from overseas coal-producing areas such as India and Vietnam has gradually increased. The daily arrivals average around five or six thousand tons, which is sufficient for the daily consumption of residents. This coal was mostly traded separately at the beginning of February this year. At that time, due to the difficulty in finding shipping, the shipment was delayed until now. A coal industry tycoon also said that the shipment of smoke-white coal to Shanghai will be more than it was a few months ago, and that this coal is mostly produced in India, Vietnam and other places, and its quality is better. It is expected that inferior coal will not be asked for in the future.

Abundant Stockpiles

Reporters also learned from various large coal companies that the coal stockpiles in this city are quite abundant, and there is no worry about shortages in the future. It is expected that due to the daily arrival of sources, the stockpiles of each coal yard are increasingly abundant. According to the persons in charge of each coal company, the total amount of smoke-white coal blocks and chips now in stock has reached about 450,000 tons. However, general non-industry merchants dare to continue to hold onto the warehouse receipts and are unwilling to sell. According to other sources, major coal companies are also hiding large amounts of spot goods and are unwilling to supply them to the industry. It is hoped that the authorities will send personnel to thoroughly investigate as soon as possible in order to clarify the darkness.

Loosening Market

In recent days, due to the slight increase in spot goods and the weakening of customers' purchases, the market for spot goods has declined. Holders are afraid that market prices will plummet, and seem anxious and are gradually selling their stockpiles on the market. Yesterday, according to news from various coal industry organizations, the coal industry market has been quite loose in recent days. However, due to the weather turning hot, buyers have gradually left the market. As for Hongji coal chips, because they are used more widely, the market price is still difficult to loosen. In order to understand the future of the coal industry market, reporters yesterday visited people familiar with the coal market. According to them, the coal industry market in this city can be seen improving. If there is no manipulation by market brokers, there will not be major changes.

Fair-Priced Coal Sold Out

In order to adhere to its original intention, the Shanghai Coal Industry Association specially continued to sell fair-priced No. 3 coal chips to the boiled water shop industry and bathhouse industry from the 17th of this month. The sale has now been completed recently, with (1) 544 tons to the boiled water shop industry and (2) 956 tons to the bathhouse industry, at 80 yuan in national currency per ton. It is learned that the Coal Industry Association has reported the figures to the Kailuan Mining Bureau, Huazhong, Yuan Tai, Yi Tai and other relevant coal companies yesterday. According to the persons in charge of the boiled water shop industry and bathhouse industry, the reason why each member can maintain the status quo is that they can obtain fair-priced coal chips. Otherwise, they would have closed down long ago.

### Mysterious Kidnapping Case Occurred After the Car Was Stopped Yesterday Afternoon; The Kidnapped Person Was the Comprador of the Huatai Shipping Company; He Was Carried Away After Chatting in the Residence for Several Hours

A mysterious kidnapping case occurred in the French Concession yesterday. The kidnapped person was Wu Guanhua, the comprador of the Huatai Shipping Company in this port. The details of the case are recorded as follows:

Serving as Comprador, Equipped with a Car

Wu Guanhua, from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, is 42 years old and married to Mrs. Gan. They live together at No. 3, Lane 2, Youning Village, Lane 197, Avenue Delastre. Wu is currently the comprador of the Huatai Shipping Company at No. 110 Sichuan Road. Because the distance to the office is very far, he is equipped with a private car, No. 6774, as transportation.

Three Guests Arrived Suddenly and Exchanged Pleasantries for a Long Time

Wu recently suffered a slight illness and was resting at home. Unexpectedly, at about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, three men in suits, one wearing dark blue and two wearing gray, all about 30 years old, entered Wu's house together. They immediately asked if Mr. Wu was in, saying that they had business to discuss. Mrs. Gan saw that the visitors were well-dressed and invited them to the parlor, and went upstairs to call Wu downstairs. The three men talked cordially with Wu until 2:15 p.m. The visitors suddenly said to Wu, "It's time to go."

Forcibly Taken Out of the Lane and Carried Away Without a Trace

Wu then went to change clothes and went upstairs to change into a long gown. The three men watched Wu downstairs and then forcibly boarded the Xiang Sheng car parked at the entrance of the lane and sped away. When leaving, Wu's wife was present, but Wu did not say a word. Afterwards, Wu's wife found the matter very strange and, because she did not know the visitors, concluded that it was a kidnapping and reported it to the French police for investigation.

Set Up Iron Wire and Thoroughly Searched

After receiving the news, the French police immediately dispatched a large team of Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate, and increased the number of patrolmen in the French Concession, such as on Avenue Haig, and set up temporary barbed wire to search passing vehicles, but nothing was found. The temporary security was removed at about 3:00 p.m. The whereabouts of Wu Guanhua, who was kidnapped in the case, are still unknown. The case is now being closely investigated by the French police.

### Book World Briefs

Because Lin Daji had gone to Hong Kong, his mother and younger brother, named Dazong, were immediately arrested and his residence was searched, but nothing was found. His youngest brother was studying at Nanyang Middle School. His family asked the Japanese authorities not to arrest him, but permission was denied. He was taken to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Hongkou. Later, detectives called out names and waited at his residence. At around 9:00 AM, his father, Lin Ziyi, returned home,

And was also arrested.

However, according to another source, yesterday morning at around 6:00 AM, five Japanese military police in plainclothes drove to the Central Police Station in Lujiawan, French Concession, requesting that personnel be dispatched to No. 1, Lane 107, Pushi Road to arrest a suspected Chinese resident. After arriving at the address, they searched the house for half an hour, but found nothing. Finally, they took the resident, Ren Daze, his wife, and nephew, a total of three people, onto the car and took them to the police station before handing them over to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Hongkou.

Educational News

### Registered Overseas Schools in Hong Kong Total Sixty, Including Zhonghua, Etc. Six Schools Receive Subsidies from the Central Government.

(Hong Kong Correspondence) Regarding the situation of overseas schools in Hong Kong, this reporter recently visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Education stationed in Hong Kong. According to him, as of this year, there are a total of sixty overseas schools in Hong Kong that are registered with our Central Government, of which six receive subsidies from the Central Government. The list of registered schools is as follows: Zhengzhong Middle School, World Electrical Engineering School, Minfan Middle School, Fanglin Middle School, Southwest Middle School, Guanghua Middle School, Dongfang Middle School, Zhiyong Middle School, Nanfang Middle School, Xiangjiang Girls' Middle School, Xianggang Middle School, Sisi Middle School, Xinxue Middle School, Xiangdao Middle School, Nanzhong Middle School, Zhixing Middle School, Zhenguang Middle School, Zhenzhong Middle School, Zhujiang Middle School, Min Da Attached Middle School, Meifang Middle School, Peidao Middle School, Huaying Girls' Middle School, Gangqiao Middle School, Huaqiao Middle School, Far East Middle School, Lingdao Girls' Middle School, Hanhua Middle School, Guangda Accounting School, Yangzhong Girls' Middle School, Shiyong Accounting School, Dazhong Middle School, Guangda Attached Elementary School, Guangda Accounting and Political Class, Jinling Middle School, Peiying Middle School, Shijian Middle School, Xinghua Middle School, Dejiao Middle School, Xingzhong Middle School, Lingdong Middle School, Lingying Middle School, Qionghai Middle School, Lizhe Girls' Middle School, Yaozhi Middle School, Taoxiu Girls' Middle School, Fudan Middle School, Peizheng Middle School, Hanzhi Middle School, Kung I Middle School, Xiangjiang Commercial Vocational School, Zhongzheng Accounting School, Daozheng Middle School, Jiujiang Middle School, Bagui Yu Elementary School, Dacheng Middle School, Zhongnan Middle School, Zhonghua Middle School.

### A Portion of Xiang University Students Arrived in Shaoguan. They Are Living in Difficult Conditions and Are Requesting Assistance from the Authorities.

(Shaoguan Correspondence) The Guangdong Provincial Li Dongqin Business School previously sent representatives to Shaoguan to request the immediate relocation of the school, which has been approved by the Provincial Government and the Department of Education, and allocated 30,000 yuan for relocation expenses. After the school's students received the news, they were all overjoyed. However, the school has never clearly stated this since receiving the order. Now, all the first-year students, because they all come from the occupied areas and have difficult economic sources, and the cost of living there is extremely high, are suffering from severe living pressures, and their dormitories are located in remote suburbs, coveted by thieves, who are alarmed every night. For the sake of their studies and survival, they have no choice but to first arrive in the north to await relocation. They set off in the middle of last month. Before departing, they sold their beds and clothes to raise travel expenses. Due to inconvenient transportation and rugged roads, they traveled thousands of miles and finally arrived in Shaoguan on the morning of the 4th after seventeen days. They are now penniless and have problems with their livelihoods, so they have specifically visited the authorities to request assistance. The Aurora University Library has always been characterized by its collection of specialized Western books on science, engineering, medicine, law, and politics, as well as ancient Chinese books. Although Western Oriental studies books have been designated as special collections, they have not yet reached a significant proportion of the entire collection. Recently, Father R. P. H. Bernard, a famous sinologist, professor at Tianjin Industrie et Commerce College and lecturer at the Hanoi École Française d'Extrême-Orient, has traveled to the Far East in recent years for academic research, visiting Vietnam, Laos, Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Japan, and Korea, collecting local languages, scripts, religions, customs, history, geography, and other historical materials. Over time, the number has increased. Mr. Pei believed that Shanghai is the transportation hub of the Far East, and the Aurora University Library has a considerable scale, so he gave his life's work to the library, asking them to organize and preserve it for the public. There are thousands of books in Chinese, English, Japanese, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, and other languages on various Eastern countries, many of which are rare good editions or secret books that cannot be purchased on the market. These were all collected by Mr. Pei while lecturing overseas, or given to him by others. The books have now been mostly cataloged and stored, waiting for connoisseurs. It is said that Mr. Pei will continue to seek out and donate anything he finds to the library so that it can become a grand sight. Recently, the Pacific situation has been treacherous, and many Chinese people are eager to understand the situation in various parts of the Far East, so the library's collection has a lot of research material.

Study Lecture

### How to Study Physics (1)

— Xu Ziwei

Physics is a course that only begins to be taught independently in middle school. Middle school students lack basic knowledge and concepts due to their background. Moreover, the central object of study is the abstract and difficult-to-understand "energy." When learning, many feel a special difficulty and often complain about the pain of studying it, which is indeed a somewhat objective fact. We know that studying any subject is not easy and must have its own theoretical difficulties. As for those who have a special feeling about physics, the reason can be attributed to two points: half due to incompatibility of temperament and half due to improper study methods. The former belongs to innate endowment, which is difficult to change, while the latter lies in artificial guidance and relies on specialized research in teaching. Modern education pays considerable attention to teaching methods, often providing study guidance for students of various subjects and pointing out directions, which is indeed a progress in education. Guiding research methods is like a compass in navigation, guiding the way in the vast ocean and completing the purpose of navigation. "How to Study Physics" is a question of exploring the path to be taken in studying physics. Now, I will put forward ten points based on my experience in teaching and the ideals I feel, according to the principles of education, and list them below for students in middle schools to use as a reference for studying physics. This article only provides practical and orderly guidance on the methods of studying physics. As for the content and scope of physics, readers can find it in physics books, so I will not add any empty discussions.

(1) Cultivate Research Interest
Interest, the emotion of striving for hard work, and overcoming the concept of fearing difficulties are necessary conditions for engaging in the study of any subject. Suppose we do not develop an interest in the subject, of course, we are unwilling to work diligently to learn it, then we cannot expect to achieve anything. Therefore, when studying physics, we must first cultivate an interest in research. With a strong interest, we are willing to work hard and overcome difficulties, and happily engage in research work. How to arouse interest in studying physics? For example, examining the actual physical phenomena in the natural world that we experience in our daily lives at any time and place, and citing them in conjunction with the materials discussed in the curriculum, doing more physical experiments, and reading interesting physics books all have the effect of increasing interest.

(2) Pay Attention to Pre-Reading Before Class
When we study physics, relying entirely on listening in the classroom often gives us a vague and clueless feeling. We only understand what we hear, and then we only know a little bit. Then we will not understand the places that the explanation does not reach and the places that we have not paid attention to. To increase the harvest and benefits of class, pre-reading before class is indeed the best way. Before class, take some spare time to automatically preview the materials that will be taught in the next decision, and get a general idea of the content. In this way, when lecturing in class, we will understand the parts that we have already roughly understood more clearly and create a deeper impression. For the parts that we don't understand, we will know to pay special attention and achieve a state of sudden enlightenment. Therefore, pre-reading before class can really solve a lot of difficulties in studying physics. (To be continued)

### Economic Construction of Free China

— Li Deming

Actual Results of Increased Production

As early as two years ago, Dr. Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs of China, formulated four principles as goals to strive for. These four principles are: (1) developing state-owned enterprises, (2) supporting private industrial and mining enterprises, (3) promoting agricultural economy, and (4) managing general economic matters.

The government's own undertakings are mainly focused on heavy industry. According to a report in 1940, as many as 26 of the government's factories had surpluses in that year. How to support private industrial and mining enterprises is the second main task of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. From the "July 7th Incident" to the end of 1938, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was busy assisting the relocation of coastal factories inland. As of October 1939, among the factories that had been assisted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in relocating inland, as many as 234 had already started work!

The Ministry of Economic Affairs has also spared no effort in increasing the output of various production industries. The coal production in Sichuan Province in 1938 was only 1,000,000 tons. By 1940, it had increased by 60 percent to 1,600,000 tons. The annual output of iron ore in the province was originally 22,000 tons, but it has now increased to 40,000 tons. At the same time, thanks to the assistance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, most of the iron factories have built new furnaces. It is estimated that in 1941, their annual output will be able to increase by about 30,000 tons.

The situation in the steel mills is also the same. New furnaces have been installed in several steel mills. It is hoped that other steel mills will also be installed one after another in the near future. At present, the monthly output of pure steel in the interior of China is about 2,000 tons. In the future, the needs of various factories in the interior for pure iron can be largely solved.

With the assistance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, various machinery factories in the interior have been able to produce a large number of hand grenades, shells, machine gun parts, gas masks, radio receivers and loudspeakers, and dry batteries, and have become affiliated factories of the arsenal. They can also manufacture various motors, generators, lathes, machine tools, and sewing machines and textile machines.

China's inland cotton weaving factories have now resumed work under the supervision of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In October 1939, the number of spindles installed was more than 30,000, and the monthly output of cotton yarn was 2,200 bales. By the end of 1939, the number of spindles had increased to 40,000. It is estimated that by the summer of 1941, the number of spindles can reach more than 100,000, and the monthly output of yarn can also increase to more than 5,000 bales. The above refers only to Sichuan Province. Cotton mills in Hunan and Shaanxi are not included.

Regarding the development of China's rural economy, the Ministry of Economic Affairs pays special attention to increasing the output of food, clothing, and other agricultural products that can be exported. Under the government's encouragement, farmers in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces are now engaged in cotton planting. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is working to transport the surplus cotton in western Hunan, northern Hubei, and Shaanxi provinces to the southwestern provinces to meet the needs of cotton weaving factories here.

Among agricultural products, tung oil and raw silk are the two main export commodities of our country, so the Ministry of Economic Affairs is now striving to improve the quality of tung oil. As for the silk industry, there have been significant achievements in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. In 1939, the improved silkworm eggs distributed to farmers in Sichuan Province were 308,000 sheets in the spring and 306,000 sheets in the autumn. According to general estimates, the output of raw silk in Sichuan in 1939 was more than 8,500 dan.

The climate in Yunnan is particularly suitable for sericulture. In 1939, the improved silkworm eggs distributed to farmers in the province were 10,000 sheets in the spring and 15,000 sheets in the autumn. In 1940, the output of raw silk in Yunnan was about 1,200 dan. It is estimated that the output can reach more than 10,000 dan in five years. At that time, Yunnan will become an important province for China's silk exports.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs also provides large-scale rural loans through its directly affiliated Agricultural and Commercial Bank. Excluding the loans from the four government banks, as of October 1939, the number of cooperative treasuries established with the assistance of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank reached 109, including 28 in Sichuan, 20 in Guangxi, 11 in Hunan, 10 in Hubei, 3 in Shaanxi, 5 in Xikang, and 9 in other war zones. The total amount of loans reached 9,304,407.68 yuan. The Ministry of Economic Affairs replied that 92 warehouses have been built in various parts of the interior, including 41 in Sichuan, 19 in Guangxi, 13 in Guizhou, 8 in Hubei, 9 in Hunan, and 2 in Shaanxi, with a storage capacity of approximately 2,247,415 dan.

In addition, regarding loans for agricultural production, including irrigation projects in Sichuan, Guangxi, Xikang, Yunnan, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Guizhou, the total amount of loans was 1,700,000 yuan. The total amount of loans for purchasing seeds, fertilizers, and repairing agricultural tools in Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces was approximately 1,884,559 yuan.

### Development of Production Resources

Regarding the two aspects of China's freedom, namely human resources and material resources, the Chinese government recently conducted a survey:

So far, the area of China that has fallen into enemy hands is approximately 4,500,000 square kilometers, accounting for only 22% of China's total area. The population in the occupied areas accounts for 42.5% of China's total population, but at least 1,500,000 people have moved to the interior after the war, so the actual percentage is even lower. According to the same survey report, the rice production in the occupied areas accounts for only 23.7% of the total production.

China's mineral products, such as tungsten, antimony, tin, lead, nickel, and arsenic, are almost entirely located within free China. Only coal and iron are found in the occupied areas. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has adopted partial control over the production and export of coal and cement in Sichuan Province, while it has adopted complete control over the production and export of tungsten, antimony, tin, mercury, steel, zinc, lead, etc., in other provinces. This is because the government wants to use the export of these mineral products to earn foreign exchange and exchange them with other friendly countries through "barter". In 1939, thanks to smooth transportation, the export value of tungsten was £2,260,000, the export value of antimony was £600,000, and the export value of tin was £600,000, totaling £3,420,000.

Since China began its economic construction after the outbreak of war, the government has taken various steps to actively develop various mineral resources in the southwest and northwest. What has been achieved in the past three and a half years? The following was recorded in the Xin Shu Bao on December 25, 1940:

(1) The production of various metal products in 1940 exceeded that of 1939 by more than 40%.

(2) According to the report of mining experts, in the first half of 1941, four-fifths of the steel factories in free China could be fully operational. By the end of 1941, China's steel production would be sufficient to meet domestic demand, and the steel needed for all heavy industries and munitions factories would no longer need to be sought from abroad.

(3) At the end of 1940, the Ministry of Economic Affairs invited more than 30 domestic steel industry experts to a meeting to discuss the future development plan of the steel industry and made the following decisions:

(A) Increase steel production and formulate steel prices to facilitate transactions for both buyers and sellers.

(B) Regarding steel transportation matters, registration with the Steel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs should be made in advance. Transportation can only begin upon obtaining permission; otherwise, it will be considered illegal.

It is heard that this meeting has reached detailed agreements on methods to increase steel production, which will be implemented soon.

(4) The collateral for the US loan to China is China's famous three minerals: antimony, tungsten, and tin. Since 1940, their production has increased greatly. China ranks first in the world in the production of antimony and tungsten. Even in Jiangxi Province alone, its reserves account for more than one-third of the world's total. Hunan's antimony mines are also very rich, and their quality is excellent. As for Yunnan's tin, it has long been famous worldwide, with an annual output value of approximately US$10 million or more.

(5) The government has recently implemented control over the production of antimony and tungsten. Those who used manual methods of production have now switched to using machinery. Therefore, the quality of China's antimony and tungsten in the international market is "improving day by day".

(6) Recently, the Renhe Company in Chongqing has invented a small melting furnace for melting steel, which has advanced the development of China's steel industry! The company is now drafting a plan to manufacture them in large quantities so that all steel factories across the country can install them.

(7) The authoritative authorities in Chongqing are now planning to conduct large-scale exploitation of oil mines in Gansu Province. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now established an oil company with a capital of 70,000,000 yuan and US$3,000,000. In order to solve the oil shortage in the interior of China, the government is actively carrying out this plan. The machines for drilling oil wells have already been ordered and will soon be transported and assembled.

According to recent news from Lanzhou, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has already extracted oil from one well in Gansu Province. Other wells will also be drilled and completed in the shortest possible time. After analysis, the oil quality is better than that of Soviet oil. Each gallon of Gansu oil can allow a car to travel 9 kilometers, while the same amount of Soviet oil can only allow it to travel 6 kilometers.

### Preparation of Production Organizations

The only principle for the Ministry of Economic Affairs to promote industrial and mining production is to guide all funds into production and to strive for close cooperation between all public and private enterprises.

The Chinese government is trying to operate all heavy industries related to national defense itself, but this does not prohibit private operation. On the contrary, if private individuals can accept government control, the government will welcome their participation.

In order to manage industries jointly established by officials and merchants, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has formulated a law that has detailed provisions for the protection of private capital and the division of rights and obligations. The purpose of the government in formulating this law is nothing more than to encourage private investment in industrial and mining enterprises in the interior. As for all foreign capital, it is also extremely welcomed by the Chinese government as long as it does not harm national sovereignty.

In 1940, the total output value of industrial and mining enterprises in free China was approximately 1,050,600,000 yuan. According to a report by Weng Wenhao, private industries accounted for approximately 55,600,000 yuan, of which the metal industry accounted for 42,600,000 yuan, the machinery industry accounted for 21,000,000 yuan, the electrical industry accounted for 11,800,000 yuan, the chemical industry accounted for 21,300,000 yuan, the textile industry accounted for 119,200,000 yuan, and the food industry accounted for 38,900,000 yuan. In addition, factories operated by the government accounted for approximately 5,000,000 yuan; as for mineral products, the total value of production was approximately 740,000,000 yuan, of which all metal ores and coal and iron accounted for approximately 370,000,000 yuan; tungsten, antimony, tin, mercury, copper, and other mineral products accounted for approximately 370,000,000 yuan; the above figures only refer to larger industries; all other handicrafts and small-scale industries have not been included.

Various products of industrial and mining enterprises in free China are mainly produced by 448 private factories, mines, and other state-owned factories. Since 1937, 120,000 tons of machinery worth 360,000,000 yuan have been relocated to the interior, of which approximately 70,000 tons were funded by the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and 50,000 tons were funded by self-reliance and other government agencies.

The distribution of the aforementioned 448 factories is as follows: 254 in Sichuan, 121 in Hunan, 27 in Shaanxi, 23 in Guangxi, and the remaining 23 are distributed in other provinces. Among these factories, there are 10,000 skilled workers, all of whom were funded by the government to move from the occupied coastal areas to the interior. In addition, the government provides various manufacturers with foreign exchange at the statutory exchange rate.

The state-run industrial and mining enterprises in free China are all established to meet the needs of wartime. Among them, the Central Machinery Factory can manufacture generators with a power generation capacity of 2,000 kilowatts for use in power plants in various cities in the interior. In addition, the government has successively established electrical plants, radio manufacturing plants, steel mills, alcohol plants, vegetable oil plants, chemical plants, and other various factories. In addition to the machinery relocated from the coast after the war, more than 10,000 tons of machinery have been purchased from overseas.

The Chinese government is now engaged in the production of copper mines in Sichuan, Xikang, and Yunnan. A tin mining company with a capital of 50,000,000 yuan has been established in Yunnan. At the same time, the government is also planning to exploit tin mines in Hunan and Guangxi. In addition, the government operates many coal mines to supply the newly built railways in Guangxi, Yunnan, and Hunan. Twelve power plants have been built in major cities in the interior, with a total power generation capacity of more than 20,000 kilowatts.

The speed of progress of privately operated factories is astonishing! The machines used in the four paper mills are products of the machine factories in free China. Two of the paper mills can now ship goods, and the other two are expected to start operations in the spring.

### A Glimpse of Capital Mobilization

Weng Wenhao recently appealed to Chinese capitalists who deposit money in foreign banks and overseas Chinese to invest their surplus funds in various production enterprises in free China. In addition to praising China's natural resources, Weng pointed out that depositing money in foreign banks is not a good idea in today's increasingly tense international situation and listed six benefits of investing in production enterprises in the interior:

(1) There is no fear of competition from inferior goods in the interior industry.

(2) Because the Chinese government controls foreign exchange, it is an opportunity to avoid competing with high-priced foreign goods imported from abroad.

(3) There are no labor disputes in the interior industry.

(4) The government not only encourages domestic industries but also provides material assistance.

(5) Wartime insurance protects domestic industries and businesses.

(6) The government guarantees a minimum profit for those who invest in the interior and provides special subsidies and tax exemptions.

In order to achieve the final victory, the Chinese government is now urging its people who are growing up in the atmosphere of war to purchase various war bonds in domestic or foreign currency and national construction savings bonds, so as to contribute their funds to the country. In addition, the Chinese government is also encouraging companies and individuals to invest in various industries and is offering various preferential treatments to overseas Chinese who return to the country to withdraw their capital, and is also urging overseas Chinese to actively participate in various patriotic activities, continue to purchase various wartime government bonds, and contribute to the country!

Commercial News

### US Cotton Prices Fall Due to Bearish News

US cotton prices fell on the fourth day due to profit-taking by bulls and political news from Washington that was favorable to bears. Prices then rebounded due to short covering, but the closing price was still down 2 to 6 points compared to the previous day. President Roosevelt opposed increasing aid to distressed farmers.

Indian cotton prices initially fell due to large-scale profit-taking by bulls, then rose slightly as bulls added positions. The closing price was still down 1 to 1.5 rupees compared to the previous day. Today's opening price forecast is expected to be 1.5 rupees higher.

### Black Iron Billets Recover After Weakness

The market for black iron billets was sluggish in recent days, and prices once fell, with the lowest price being around 2,800 yuan. However, since the day before yesterday, people from Tianjin have started to inquire, and local factories have also started to collect them, so the market situation has been enthusiastic and the sentiment is strong. The standard market price has rebounded. Yesterday's opening price was 2,000 yuan per 1,000 pounds for old steel factories, and 2,800 yuan per box for new steel factories. However, because overseas sources are currently cut off and there is not much inventory in the market, people in the industry are optimistic about the market outlook and feel that they will not sell until the price of new steel factories reaches 3,200 yuan.

### Cigarette Wholesale and Retail Sales Discussed and Decided by the Guild

Due to chaotic purchase prices among fellow traders, the cigarette wholesale and retail sales situation has been discussed and decided by the guild. In order to protect the interests of both labor and capital, each trader should pay a deposit of 200 yuan. If anyone is found to be engaging in secret subsidies in violation of the rules, they will be severely punished without any leniency. The prices of various cigarettes are listed separately below (unit: yuan):

### What I Saw, What I Heard, What I Thought

The market last weekend showed a sign. There will be a turbulent low market to end this disturbance. A group of remaining bulls in the foreign exchange and gold market will have grease on their feet and will only be able to escape.

Shanghai has now become a large "isolated army camp," which is no longer comparable to the era of the so-called "isolated island." The ones on Jiaozhou Road are just two small models.

The Bureau of Public Works has now adopted a direct price limit policy for the rice market. But will it turn into a damp firecracker again? It depends on what attitude the Bureau of Public Works itself will take towards its own prestige. Only those who abandon themselves are champions in failure.

To eliminate the fee subsidy black market in the rice market, administrative detention should be imposed, and the business license of the firm should be revoked, and the illegally traded goods should be confiscated. It is not enough to just detain the two or one employees who are working for others to serve as a warning. Because they can still recover their losses from the price increase movement and obtain more benefits.

These days, an air show is being held in the Shanghai sky. The friends who pick up garbage on the road are dreaming of the luck of their counterparts in Chongqing. In fact, if the police station collects shrapnel for investigation, then they also have a business to do.

### Domestic Science Principles of Food Preservation

— Casual Notes from Wang Yi's Journey to Holland

Advanced Western countries are particular about food preservation methods, and the efforts made in the past year have been the most diligent. Those who can obtain the methods may not be able to guarantee how long they can preserve food, but they can generally use it for a few more days. In summary, things have four suitable conditions: Coolness. Warmth accelerates acidification and makes it easy to spoil. Fresh vegetables with leaves are most unsuitable for storing with water. Sweet potatoes should never be stored in cellars while wet, because water easily causes acidification. Darkness. When fruits and vegetables are placed in sunlight, the life-sustaining vitamins (nutrients) disappear silently. Wind. Refers to the circulation of air. Conversely, excessive warmth, excessive cold, pressure, dampness, or exposure to sunlight should be avoided, depending on the type of object. Here are ten additional points for clarification with examples:

1. In large buildings with central heating systems, indoor cabinets in rooms heated by furnaces, kitchens that are too warm or too humid, and large wooden cabinets under outdoor eaves that cannot avoid humidity are not conducive to food preservation.

2. Meats should be placed in a dry and cool place, even unopened canned meats.

3. Smoked dried meat or preserved meat should be wrapped in cloth bags and hung in a ventilated place. Avoid laying them flat to prevent the bottom half from being weighed down by the top half. Small cabbages or caulifower are also beneficial to hang for the same reason.

4. Apples with shiny, oily skins are not easy to dry after picking. They should be spread out on newspapers instead of being stacked. If they are touched, black spots will appear. Other fruits and vegetables are generally better spread out and should not be stacked. If indoor space is limited, they can be stored in shallow, ventilated baskets or flat boxes made of wooden strips, and only a few baskets can be stacked in rows. If space is large or the quantity is large, they can be spread out on straw. Be sure to check for damaged ones first and remove them to prevent them from affecting other fruits. Fruits that are picked by hand rather than shaken to the ground can be stored longer. In very cold weather, fruits should be protected from freezing by temporarily covering them with paper. When the weather warms up slightly, the paper should be removed, otherwise the fruit will be damaged after a long time.

5. Vegetables and fruits should not be stored together. Things with strong odors should not be stored with other things that easily absorb aromas. Celery is best stored in a cellar that does not freeze or see light, but the cellar doors and windows must be covered with thick felt to prevent freezing, and the air must be ventilated and changed daily at certain times. If you don't have a cellar at home, you can use a dark room without a stove that doesn't freeze. This method is especially suitable for fruits, such as apples, which are best spread out in a room that is not warm, does not see light, and does not freeze.

6. Storing sweet potatoes is like storing coal, but they must be stacked in a dark place that is not too warm to prevent them from sprouting. However, a slanted board should be inserted into the bottom of the box for storing sweet potatoes so that when the sweet potatoes stored at the bottom of the box are taken out first, they can fall out and prevent the newly added parts from being taken by mistake.

7. Garlic is not very afraid of freezing and can be placed in an unused dark room at will.

8. Rice, soybeans, dried peas, wheat, and other grains are best stored in pillowcase-style white cloth bags sewn with thread.

9. Sago (i.e., millet), oatmeal, sweet potato flour, cornstarch, and other items that have not been used should be kept in their original paper packaging.

China is located in the subtropics, and food is difficult to store for a long time in summer. Chinese-style doors and windows are not as tightly sealed as Western houses, and humidity is more harmful than in other countries. In addition, one should be careful to prevent rats or pests from invading. If someone with experience can save resources for the extraordinary period and improve the people's livelihood, it is indeed an urgent task.

### Sarong

— Nai Liu

Anyone who has been to Myanmar or Singapore should know what a sarong is. Especially in Myanmar, almost everyone, regardless of age or gender, wears a sarong instead of pants. In Singapore, older people generally like to wear Malay clothes, which are shirts made of very thin gauze, and sarongs underneath.

There is a story about sarongs:

During the Three Kingdoms period, there was an event – which has been passed down to the present and can be seen in dramas – called "Zhuge Liang Captures Meng Huo Seven Times." Meng Huo was said to be a southern barbarian at that time. Compared with the Central Plains at that time, the difference in cultural and intellectual wisdom was certainly not small. Otherwise, how could Zhuge Liang have made Meng Huo so obediently captured? It is said that when Meng Huo was captured, he was just a naked man with a large cluster of black hair below his chest and on his navel, and a body of fat. However, this dignified man did not mind being naked. Instead, Zhuge Liang seemed embarrassed for him, or thought it was indecent, so he gave him a piece of cloth and told Meng Huo to make it into a skirt-like shape to cover his body.

However, Meng Huo was clumsy and simply didn't understand what a skirt was, so no matter how he made it, there were no pleats, and he just connected the two sides of the cloth together, like a bottomless wooden barrel. After it was made, it was not convenient to wear, so it could only be put on from the head. However, even though Meng Huo was clumsy, from that time on, the people in the south – that is, Myanmar and Annam, etc. – had the sarong.

The sarong has existed until now, perhaps because it is suitable for the hot climate, so it still exists. Whether it is a nobleman or a commoner, they cannot do without it. The only difference is whether it is elaborate or not, and whether the patterns or textures are different. And when these sarongs are worn, they still have to be put on from the head!

### A Week's Home Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Recently, some fresh seasonal vegetables have come onto the market. Things like water caltrop sprouts are newly emerged water caltrops and are very fresh and tender. When eating with meat, they are mostly used to stir-fry with shredded pork or shredded beef; of course, stir-frying with sliced chicken or shredded chicken is also always suitable. For vegetarian dishes, they can be used to braise tofu, adding some wood ear mushrooms, etc., which feels very refreshing. If you want something simpler, you can mix them with sesame oil or sesame paste, which can also be used as a side dish for porridge. In addition, crown daisy is also newly available, besides stir-frying, it can be mixed and eaten, similar to mixing with horsehair vegetable, which can help clear heat.

### Misunderstanding Between Soy Sauce and Stomach Problems

— Ren Xiben

Previously in this publication, Mr. Qing Cong and Mr. Bai Ma discussed the text of soy sauce and stomach problems, but it seems that they have not scratched the itch. Before Mr. Qing Cong, etc., published an article, I often heard people say that soy sauce contains substances that easily cause stomach problems; however, they could not point out which kind of soy sauce.

After reading Mr. Qing Cong's article, I began to study this point extensively and found it quite puzzling. According to soy sauce, it contains a lot of salt, and salt is a good medicine for nourishing the stomach, so there is no reason to harm the stomach. Even what Mr. Qing Cong called excess hydrochloric acid that has not been neutralized is probably difficult to cause disease. Excess hydrochloric acid and excess alkalinity are both quite irritating to the tongue, one being too sour and the other too astringent. It is not easy to eat, and if there is such a soy sauce, it will definitely not be sold because it cannot be drunk. Only those that are not acidic or alkaline neutralized have no sour or astringent taste, so it can be asserted that there is no such over-or-under-supplied goods on the market. There is absolutely no problem with this point, and the so-called stomach problem layer cannot be explored.

Yesterday, I met a person in the soy sauce industry and talked to him about the anti-mold problem of soy sauce. According to him, Shanghai soy sauce gardens all use salicylic acid as a preservative. As soon as I heard this, I suddenly understood. The so-called misunderstanding that soy sauce causes stomach problems must come from this. Although salicylic acid can prevent corruption; however, it cannot be used too much, otherwise it will easily damage the stomach. Those old-style workers, when using new medicines, often do not pay attention to the amount and use them arbitrarily, which naturally makes it easy for drinkers to damage their stomachs. People who make new soy sauce have many types of preservatives, such as "Gilbercto," "Paragua," "Mais Prolomine," "Angtigen," "Anglot," "Angsin," etc., which are all absolutely safe, so no one uses harmful salicylic acid.

It can be seen that soy sauce itself does not have a stomach-damaging cause, but the preservatives used in soy sauce are slightly problematic.

### Thoughts on a Sailing Ship Accident

— Zhang Mengzhao

The problem of travel is becoming increasingly difficult, not only is it full of dangers to go out as a guest, but even on a small isolated island, there is a sigh of "not being able to travel"! Car fares rise and the price of walking is high, bandits are numerous and the safety of life is dangerous, in this chaotic world, there is a sense of "being worse than an ant's life"! Reading the newspaper report: "Detailed Record of Sailing Ship Accident Crossing Hangzhou Bay at Night"! Just look at a few small headlines: "Small Boat Crossing More Than Three Hundred Li"; "Strong Wind and Tide, Accident at Night"; "Unprecedented Tragedy, Occurring in an Instant"; "Rescued Corpses, Mostly Naked"; "Family Members Searching for Corpses, A Cry of Grief;" This unprecedented tragedy! Admonishing makes people feel really sour! We study the issue of responsibility for the tragedy: (1) The boat boss (the helmsman) is sloppy and flustered in doing business. (2) The boat is small and the number of people is large, exceeding the load. (3) The passengers are too careless about the danger to their lives, anxious and greedy to board the boat. (4) The so-called local officials are too indulgent, ...; thus, all are carried away! It evolved into a great tragedy of wives leaving, husbands parting, calling out to sons, and crying to daughters.

I used to take sailing ships, and often the wind was strong and the boat capsized, extremely dangerous, but the boatmen let the sails dominate, drinking and laughing! Seeing nothing. As a person on the boat, I was sweating and worried that I would be buried in the belly of a fish. Fortunately, the boat was small and there were few people, and it sailed on the vast Taihu Lake with 36,000 hectares of water, not as dangerous as the waves in the Zhejiang sea (Hangzhou Bay), so it was fortunately unharmed. I send a message to fellow passengers, do not take "smooth sailing" and your personal life as a child's play, you must take the safety of the journey as the first priority, do not rush to buy tickets, do not rush to board the boat, what does it matter if you delay a little longer?

I press "帆" is also written as "颿", a boat, with sails to sail the wind, see Jiyun, Shiming, "帆, 汎 also, with the wind Zhang Man Yue 汎,使舟疾汎汎然也. You fan yin trap, the boat makes the wind also Tang Han Tuizhi, (Yu) Removed from office to Que Poetry Cloud: "No Yin Fan Jiang Shui,", is the truth, because attached to the description.

### Sleep (Below)

— Bao Fuxing

Generally speaking, there are two important conditions for sleeping posture: First, to avoid sexual impulses, the legs are best bent. Second, the body is best on the right side, so that the waste that has been digested in the stomach can easily flow into the small intestine, and the liver does not compress the front of the small intestine. The Tao II item conditions are just your advisor, the real sleep posture is best determined by yourself, and everyone can have his own set of special sleep postures. Sleep is originally a free enjoyment.

Finally, I talk about insomnia. The pain of people with insomnia, the kind of tossing and turning in bed, the difficulty of thinking east and west, is difficult for those who have not experienced it personally to know. Insomnia is not a major problem, but it is indeed very uncomfortable. In recent years, the weapons to deal with insomnia have increased day by day. Let's give a few examples: such as counting the chimes or silently reciting numbers, from the beginning to the sleep, or like staring at something for a long time, or reading difficult and uninteresting books, or like pressing the temples on both sides with the index and middle fingers of both hands, are all wonderful methods. If you want to know the detailed details of insomnia, I would like to introduce you to a book, the title of the book is "The Treatment of Insomnia", the editor is Zhou Jin'an, published by the Commercial Press, a thin volume, priced at one hair.

Spring and Autumn

### Missing a Thousand for Every One Caught

— Ren Wei

When I was still in middle school, I already saw an example of "missing a thousand for every one caught."

The matter was that the principal of that middle school colluded with the director of general affairs to commit fraud. Because the matter was not kept secret, it was discovered by the students, causing a storm throughout the school. The principal repeatedly declared in the memorial week that there was no such thing, and heavily criticized the rumor-mongers for having ulterior motives; however, as the saying goes, "There is one correct reason, and there are hundreds of unreasonable reasons." Under the "ten eyes watching" and "ten fingers pointing," the principal had to feel a little chills, so he dismissed a small teacher who he thought was suspected of fraud. Who knew that this would expose his own face. When the county education bureau came to take over his account, even a school badge was pawned by him in a bookstore.

Such examples can be encountered anytime and anywhere. Small things like the King of Slot Machines facing lawsuits, but slot machines are still popular as usual; large things like small businessmen and petty officials who speculate and commit fraud are punished and executed, but those who truly make a fortune from national disasters are still at large.

### "The World of Immortals"

— Dun Zi Mang

A countryman who came to Shanghai for the first time, he saw the double-layered "buses," with ladies sitting by the windows watching the scenery; he sat in the rising and falling elevator, and in a moment he rose to a very high place; he tasted a scoop of ice cream for the first time, admiring the fresh and exotic taste; he watched movies and listened to wireless electricity; his eyes were dazzled and his ears were confused, and he was a little dazed; he vaguely "criticized": "Shanghai is really a 'world of immortals'!"

But is Shanghai really a "world of immortals"?

I say: it's still a little short now, but the time is not far away.

I walked past a yellow gatehouse, where a "disaster elimination and rescue dharma assembly" was being held.

Inside the "dharma assembly," tin foil was shining, yellow paper was flying, and a person who looked neither like a Taoist priest nor a monk but had some "strange" features closed his eyes and held Buddhist beads, chanting words. Beside him were some pious old women; the "words" that were chanted, no matter what "Shan Hai Jing" they were, always contained a kind of "mana," and it was "boundless"; this must be the plaything of the "residents," "masters," or "immortal families" of the isolated island. The "dharma assembly" was hidden in the corner of the street, like a "cave." This is the same as the news people, who have a kind of "potential," not to mention that in addition to "eliminating disasters," there is also a proactive and fundamental method of construction: "rescuing," which benefits everyone a lot! Therefore, in addition to the four major "jungles" and other temples and nuns, monks, astrologers, and character measurers, various "semi-immortals" are often found on isolated islands. Sometimes, a flyer of "immortals" is suddenly seen: "Jade Emperor on... April 7 Heavenly Dog... filthy blood... killing chickens one day..." Once, a person dressed as a half-Taoist priest descended on "my home," asking for a few grains of rice, saying it was "to eliminate disasters." I still "can't figure it out," is it really an "immortal" who has come to the world?

So, if we include those who can know the past and the future, the first-class characters of fortune-telling who are "honored from the South Seas," then the "foundation layer" of the "world of immortals" has been laid.

What's more, the unfolding of objective facts is really beneficial to Shanghai becoming a "world of immortals":

Rice can rise in price, and coal has also risen in price. Some people have difficulty making "rice without rice," and some people have difficulty having "food without cooking." Taking care of this and losing the other, pulling and tugging, there is only this little bit of money. When rice is bought, there is no coal; when coal balls roll in, white rice is missing; therefore, someone invented "diet health," and "non-hunger pills" were immediately introduced to the market. In the future, Shanghai rice and coal shops will have to "close their doors," because Shanghainese have become "immortals" and do not use fireworks.

This seems to be good news, but I was not born with an "immortal bone," and it seems that it is still useless...

### Sold Out

— Li Yi

Housewife: "How much is a load of coal briquettes?"

Clerk: "Seventeen yuan."

Housewife: "The store diagonally opposite only sells for fifteen yuan!"

Clerk: "Then why don't you go to the store diagonally opposite to buy?"

Housewife: "They're sold out!" Clerk: "If we sell out, we'll only sell for fourteen yuan and fifty cents!"

(VII) Draw a Cross on Your Face

Wang Lao'er didn't pay attention to Ke Wu, but picked up the glass, slowly and slowly drank the remaining half glass of white wine, secretly calculating the steps to deal with; because he knew that what Ji Zhaoxiong said was simply more unreliable than someone else's fart. After he found out the secret nest built by Qiu Haitang and Luo Xiangqi, if he told him directly and happily without using some means, then don't say that one hundred yuan would be blown away, maybe even ten yuan would not be available!

At the same time, Ji Zhaoxiong was also planning in his heart, he thought that if he could really get three hundred yuan, Wang Lao'er's brothers would definitely divide them six yuan; just running a leg, giving them two percent, it was really not a loss to them!

In fact, these two guys' thoughts were all in vain, because Xiangqi's arrangement was very thorough, not to mention that her own actions were very cautious, that is, Qiu Haitang listened to her dispatch every time she came to Tianjin, so Wang Lao'er and Wang Lao San, two small hooligans, were entrusted by Ji Zhaoxiong, although they repeatedly tracked Qiu Haitang several times, the result was that they did not have any clues. In the blink of an eye, another month passed, but Ji Zhaoxiong's financial luck has been small recently, and he wanted to get money everywhere, but he ran into walls everywhere; the debts owed to the store and gambling debts gradually forced him to have no way out. Finally, he couldn't help but repeatedly think about Qiu Haitang.

These days, Yuan Baofan and Yuan Shaowen happened to be in Tianjin, having just returned from playing in Beidaihe for two weeks. Therefore, when Qiu Haitang came, he also followed Xiangqi's instructions. As soon as he got off the train, he went directly to Yuan's house, unlike every time when he stayed at the Tianjin Hotel. Although the garrison envoy no longer had any ambition for him, he was still very happy to see him, so he happily kept him and prepared to play together for a few days before returning to Beijing.

"Boss Wu, can you help me with a small amount that I discussed with you last time today?" One early morning, when everyone else had not yet gotten up, Ji Zhaoxiong quietly sneaked into Qiu Haitang's room and said with a very ugly smile on his face.

### "Gaining Without Labor" and "Laboring Without Gaining"

— Hongshui

Sitting comfortably on the sofa: beer, cigars, concubines embracing left and right..., happily: announcements, statements, publicizing the name; slightly frustrated, then silently going to sell "gourd medicine", this kind of life, called "gaining without labor", is it not too much?

Whip on the head, power... wife weeping and children calling under the feet, plus the level of life increasing daily (the unspoken is wonderful), but asking myself from morning to night, except for excretion, eating, there is no room for a trace of free time..., this kind of thing is also called life, it is really "laboring without gaining"!

Each person has a sky above his head, some seem to be burdened with "the trust of heaven's destiny", and do the trick of "stealing the sky and changing the day", so they greatly gain their gain without labor: some are "Qi people complaining about heaven" and always relying on fate, so they gain nothing and labor greatly. It is really sighing!

This kind of contradiction is unfair, and now it is fiercely burning, it is really...

But "one labor" and constant "eternal ease" is inevitable to "derail", because "unevenness" is to "buzz", one buzz, then do not buzz then stop, (there will be unexpected "amazing").

Where is the "surprise"? Or like this: just where the "gainer without labor" is more and more without labor, the "laborer without gain" is more and more necessary to labor, the more labor the more without gain, but people more and more without labor the more they gain, I think that even the natural idiot will become smart!
