### U.S. Undersecretary of State Announces Neutrality Act Does Not Apply to the Soviet Union; Economic and Diplomatic Relations Between the Two Countries Remain Unchanged; U.S. Ships Will Sail to Soviet Ports in the Pacific

Washington, 5th (Havas) - The Undersecretary of State, Mr. Welles, in a statement to the press, said that the United States should not feign neutrality regarding the German-Soviet war. I am acting under the orders of President Roosevelt to declare that the President has no intention of implementing the Neutrality Act. According to the provisions of the Neutrality Act, it is necessary for the President or both houses of Congress to "believe that a state of war has already been established between the powers and that it is necessary to protect the American people and preserve the peace of the United States" before the Neutrality Act can be declared. However, at this time, in order to protect the American people and preserve the peace of the United States, there is no need to implement this law. In other words, the attitude that the United States should take towards the German-Soviet war is exactly the same as that taken towards the Sino-Japanese war. In practice, whether in terms of economic, commercial, diplomatic, or military affairs, the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union remain unchanged. If necessary, the United States will be able to transport arms to various Soviet ports in the Pacific. However, because President Roosevelt has already issued an order declaring various ports along the Baltic Sea and the Arctic Ocean as war zones, U.S. ships cannot sail to them. Diplomatic circles are discussing that the United States is giving significant assistance to the Soviet Union, but it is still difficult to say at this time in what form it will be provided. Conservative observers also say that the United States is currently fully assisting Britain, but it has no such obligation to Britain's allies. Therefore, assisting Britain is absolutely prioritized, and U.S. assistance to the Soviet Union should be indirect in nature.

Washington, 26th (United Press) - Yesterday, the government lifted the Neutrality Act regarding the German-Soviet conflict. American war materials can now flow from Vladivostok into the Soviet Union via the Pacific. Undersecretary of State Welles announced this new step, indicating the government's support for the Soviet Union. President Roosevelt has decided not to implement the Neutrality Act in his efforts to help the Soviet Union. This is the first time that the United States has not adopted the Neutrality Act in a series of past wars. However, experts believe that American aid to the Soviet Union will temporarily become a verbal guarantee, because Britain has already obtained the right to prioritized assistance. However, this move is very important and sufficient to show that the United States is willing to resist Germany.

U.S. Navy Has No Need to Assist the Soviet Union in the Pacific

Washington, 26th (United Press) - Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters that the United States does not intend to establish a naval patrol in the Pacific to protect merchant ships sailing to the Soviet Union. The existing Pacific Fleet will also not change its original patrol mission. The Atlantic naval patrol system is not necessary because there is no German navy present. No German warships have been heard of for months. The U.S. Navy Department also has no plans to provide assistance to the Soviet Navy because the Soviet Union has its own warships and submarines in the Pacific. The U.S. government does not intend to declare martial law in Hawaii or expand the governance of the area's land and sea forces. According to Mr. Knox, this is in response to rumors that Hawaii will be placed under martial law.

U.S. Secretary of the Navy Believes a Protracted German-Soviet War is Advantageous to the U.S.

Washington, 26th (United Press) - Secretary of the Navy Knox declared yesterday that a war between Germany and the Soviet Union that is prolonged will be beneficial to both Britain and the United States. It would be beneficial if the Red Army could lure the German army deep into the Soviet Union, causing the German forces to be dispersed. However, Secretary Knox said that he personally believes that if the Soviet Union uses its full strength to resist at the border, then the war may not be prolonged. Mr. Knox said that the inexhaustible manpower of the Soviet Union is an important factor. The military value of this point can be understood by observing Japan's exhaustion in China. Mr. Knox also said that the German fleet cannot use the Baltic Sea as a playground until it has hunted down and destroyed all of the more than seventy Soviet submarines. Mr. Knox estimates that the Soviet Union has about eighteen destroyers, one battleship, and several cruisers. There are other forces in the Black Sea. In the Pacific Ocean, they operate from Vladivostok.

### U.S. President Urges Citizens to Dedicate Themselves to the Nation

Washington, 26th (United Press) - President Roosevelt issued a formal proclamation yesterday, comparing the current crisis of the United States to the difficult times of 1776, and asking the American people to rededicate themselves to the nation based on the principles of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, American Independence Day. The President's proclamation reads: "July 4 has always been a happy holiday. I introduce this anniversary to Americans all over the world so that, in addition to celebrating happily, we can continue our belief that Americans have struggled, sacrificed, been brave and indomitable, and used extraordinary insights to create this country."

U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines Requests Removal of Export Restrictions to the Soviet Union

Manila, 26th (United Press) - Reliable sources said last night that the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, has requested Washington to consider removing export controls from the Philippines to the Soviet Union, due to recent actions by Washington to assist Moscow. Before the Philippine government was included in the export control process, the Philippines transported large quantities of coconut oil, copra, and hemp to the Soviet Union.

British Mission Will Go to Moscow Immediately; Cripps Will Also Return to His Post

London, 26th (Reuters) - Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that the British mission to the Soviet Union, mentioned by British Prime Minister Churchill in the House of Commons on Tuesday, will be composed of representatives of the army, navy, and air force, as well as economic experts. It will depart for Moscow in the shortest possible time. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps, who is currently in London for talks, will return to his post in a few days.

Vichy, 25th (Havas) - U.S. Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, visited the Soviet Embassy again today to meet with Ambassador Bogomolov for talks that lasted thirty minutes, likely to study U.S.-Soviet relations after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war.

### Important Japanese Figures Hold Joint Meeting; Continue Discussing the German-Soviet Problem

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - After U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles announced the permission for U.S. ships to transport U.S. supplies to Vladivostok to help the Soviet Union resist Germany, Japanese newspapers here today made no comments on it. Official comments have also not been obtained. However, it is understood that Japan will regard this move as unfriendly to the Axis powers. Government leaders continued discussions today and held a joint meeting between the government and senior command at the Prime Minister's residence to continue carefully discussing the problems Japan faces due to the Soviet-German war. After the meeting, Minister of the Army Ogura met with the Japanese Emperor. Representatives from the government side attending the joint meeting were Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, Interior Minister Hiranuma, Army Minister Tojo, and Navy Minister Kawa. Cabinet Secretary Tomita and Foreign Ministry official Ohashi. Representatives from the senior command were Army Chief of Staff General Sugiyama, Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Nagano, Army Deputy Chief of Staff Tsukada, and Navy Deputy Chief of Staff 藤.

### Large Quantities of U.S. Goods Arrive in Suez

New York, 26th (Reuters) - According to a Washington dispatch from the World News Report, a large quantity of goods shipped out under the Lend-Lease Act has now arrived in the Suez Canal.

### Pro-Axis Elements in Japan Hold Meeting

Tokyo, 26th (United Press) - Pro-Axis figures among Japanese leaders, probably due to the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, met today at the Tokyo Trading Hotel to draft "strong advice to the government regarding the policies that Japan should follow in the future." Participants included former Interior Minister and former Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Admiral Suetsugu, General Nakamura, former Prime Minister Hayashi, Colonel Hashimoto, former Black Dragon Society leader Toyama, pro-Axis leader Nakano, and Adachi, among others.

### Japan Pays Close Attention to the Status of Vladivostok; Deeply Worried That If the Soviet Union Fails, Germany Will Use It as a Base

Tokyo, 26th (United Press) - Japan's belief that the German army will be able to defeat the Soviet Union in the short term has made Vladivostok, a Soviet Pacific port 600 miles north of Japan, a focal point of attention. Japanese commentators have begun to speculate on whether Vladivostok will be occupied by Germany or by the United States if the Soviet Union collapses. Some sources pointed out that Japan might as well occupy the port itself. However, so far, the Japanese government has not indicated that it is considering taking this action. Many believe that the German army will not launch a large-scale offensive directly into Siberia to Vladivostok. However, many also believe that once the Soviet Union is forced to submit, Germany will demand that Stalin cede Vladivostok as a condition for peace. It is pointed out that if Germany gains a base in the Pacific Ocean, it will have a far-reaching impact on the situation in the Far East and the progress of the European war. Japan has felt safer since signing the Tripartite Pact, because Germany and Italy are currently not threatening Japan. However, according to the views of military observers, if German aircraft and warships are stationed at Pacific ports, then Japan's position will change greatly. If Germany is adjacent to Japan in the Pacific Ocean, then Japan will face a country that has "elasticity," a country that is in a "forward-charging" posture and may covet the Dutch East Indies. At that time, Japan's hidden worries will no longer be the Soviet Union, with whom it recently signed a treaty of friendship. Japanese commentators also predict that U.S.-Soviet cooperation against Germany may allow the U.S. Navy and Air Force to use Vladivostok if necessary. The Japanese believe that the United States has signed a similar treaty with Britain to use the port of Singapore when necessary. The Japanese are also deeply impressed by the U.S. receiving air and naval bases all over the world. Another group of Japanese commentators believes that a Soviet Union under German control will also threaten Japan in China. Travelers in the streets predict that German troops will arrive in Chongqing "earlier than Japan." However, as of now, the Japanese government has not officially acknowledged this possibility. The Japanese government is now paying close attention to the Soviet Union's war against Germany in the next month to make a final decision.

### Japanese Side Denies Cabinet Reshuffle

Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) - A government official spokesperson today strongly denied rumors that the Konoe Cabinet will be changed and that Foreign Minister Matsuoka intends to resign due to the Soviet-German war. Matsuoka visited the Imperial Palace this afternoon to report on the various developments in the international situation to the Japanese Emperor.

Stockholm, 26th (Reuters) - The Stockholm Daily News reported a Berlin dispatch stating that people in Berlin believe that Japan will soon reshuffle its cabinet and that Matsuoka will no longer be in charge of foreign affairs. This is the first step in changing its attitude towards the Soviet Union. There is much speculation in Berlin about whether Japan will seize Vladivostok after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Social Democratic Newspaper in Stockholm also reported a Berlin dispatch stating that Berlin is now awaiting Japan's decision. There is undoubtedly an exchange of opinions between Tokyo and Berlin. Political circles in Berlin are now optimistic, believing that Japan's neutrality is temporary. Japan will await the attitude of the United States. There are rumors in Berlin that Japanese representatives abroad will soon gather in the capital of Spain to hold a large meeting. At that time, representatives from other Axis countries, as well as Spanish figures Franco and Foreign Minister Suner, will all attend the meeting. The Stockholm Daily News also reported a Rome dispatch stating that although the Communist Party advocates for U.S. participation in the war, the German-Soviet war will have the effect of preventing a formal outbreak of war between the United States and the Axis powers.

### U.S. Detains Romanian Ship

### The New World Situation and the Far East

Since the Soviet Union and Germany have finally clashed, the torrent of war has swept across all of Europe. Several countries that were previously relegated to a corner or protected by the Nazis and had not directly participated in the war have been unable to extricate themselves from the war under this new shock. Sweden and Finland are like that, let alone others. Therefore, solely in terms of the European mainland, this war has obviously far exceeded the scope of the last regional war, except that countries outside of Europe have been less involved in the war so far. Before today, the United States' entry into the war was almost imminent, but Hitler suddenly moved his troops eastward at this time. Regardless of whether it objectively has the intention of delaying the U.S.-German clash, it has indeed delayed that opportunity. The decisive battle between Britain and Germany has been temporarily replaced by the Soviet-German war. This naturally gives Britain and the United States more time to prepare. At the same time, it also accelerates the consumption of the Nazis' own forces; however, if the Nazis attack the Soviet Union and succeed, then Britain and the United States will soon face a major crisis. Even if their war against Germany is not fundamentally hopeless, it will be far more difficult than before. The Nazis' conspiracy to instigate democratic countries to jointly oppose the Soviet Union has already been sternly rejected by Britain and the United States. Therefore, the only major task for Britain and the United States is to promote the victory of the Soviet Union's war against Germany, without any delay or hesitation.

However, the joint British, American, and Soviet opposition to Germany, although an urgent matter at present, is not enough to encompass everything in the international arena at this time. Parallel to the European war, a war between China and Japan has long existed in the Far East. The forms and goals of these two wars are indeed different, and they are still mutually isolated and unrelated. However, both take anti-aggression as their fundamental key. In this regard, the Sino-Japanese war can undoubtedly be said to have been the precursor to the European anti-aggression war. The great contributions that China's arduous warfare has provided to the whole world have only been seen by the world since the outbreak of the European war. In the past year or two, the assistance given to China by various friendly countries in both spiritual and material aspects has been unanimously praised by all justice-loving people around the world. However, on the other hand, the appeasement policy and accommodating aggression, which have already brewed world upheaval, have also emerged from time to time in the diplomatic arena of the Far East, invisibly reducing the obligation of assisting China. Of course, any country, even if it supports justice to the utmost, cannot but put its own safety and interests first. This point is originally not necessary to criticize and is not blameworthy, but the safety of any country cannot be guaranteed by the good intentions or promises of aggressors. Take the Soviet Union as an example. Previously, in order to avoid the danger of being attacked, it had no choice but to sign a non-aggression pact. The effect was at most to postpone the attack for a certain period of time. Nazi actions were not restricted by the non-aggression pact. Another example is the Soviet-Japanese signing of the neutrality treaty and the recent conclusion of trade agreements and border agreements. It has now been factually determined that these were for the purpose of ensuring the safety of the Eastern Frontier during the war against Germany; however, since the non-aggression pact cannot guarantee long-term friendship between the Soviet Union and Germany, how can the agreements concluded with Japan be trusted? Now that the ink on the documents is not yet dry, the policy of advancing north to the continent, which has been shelved, has become clamorous again. This is a serious lesson. In democratic countries, there are often distinctions between the European war and the Far East, and even a strong tendency to subordinate the Far Eastern war to the interests of the European war, not hesitating to make concessions in the Far East for the sake of the European situation. Although this trend has been greatly weakened due to the mutual collusion of aggressors who fantasize about dividing the world, it has not disappeared and remained so until recently. Now Japan is feeling very bewildered by the sudden changes in the European situation. The British, Americans, and Soviets are still insufficiently alert and active in the Far East. It is expected that after the Nazi side has already created an anti-Soviet united front on the European continent, the first thing they will definitely pay attention to is Japan, in order to achieve the effect of jointly attacking the Soviet Union. The Far East is in reality no different from the weakest link in the British, American, and Soviet war front against Germany.

The joint anti-aggression of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union has been the highest ideal of people for many years, but it has not been realized due to the different circumstances and views between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which has given the aggressors some favorable opportunities. For example, the Soviet side, in order to ease relations with Japan in order to oppose Germany, has objectively promoted Japan's southward ambitions. If the Soviet-German war had not broken out rapidly, the sparks of the Dutch East Indies negotiations might not have ignited a prairie fire in the Pacific. From the current situation, it is clear that China is the main force in stabilizing the Far East. Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should all take appropriate measures in the Far East with the same steps of mutual consultation under this center of gravity, so that Hitler's chess piece, which was laid out in the Pacific Ocean long ago, can no longer play a role, and to achieve the effect of turning chaos into order in the Far East as soon as possible. Then the subsequent joint British, American, and Soviet opposition to Germany can be free from being constrained by other aspects. As long as the correct strategy is used, the future of the anti-aggression war will definitely be bright.

### National Land Tax Collected and Managed by the Central Government; It is Decided to Implement it Uniformly This Year; Land Tax Management Offices Will Be Established in Provinces, Cities, and Counties in the Short Term; In Addition to Collecting Land Tax, Land Reporting Will Also Be Handled

Therefore, land tax management offices will be established in provinces, cities, and counties in the short term. In addition to collecting land tax, land reporting will also be handled. At the same time, cities and counties that have not established public treasuries must also complete them within a time limit. According to statistics from the Ministry of Finance, as of the end of May, 553 public treasuries in cities and counties have been completed, of which Sichuan Province accounts for 80.

### Tragedy in Chongqing Air Raid Shelter; Cause of the Disaster Clarified; Many People Died While Fleeing in Panic; Improvement Work Has Been Completed

Chongqing - On June 7, a tragic incident occurred in an air raid shelter in Chongqing in which many people suffocated to death. A Reuters defense reporter visited the air raid shelter with a representative from the Air Defense Headquarters this morning to inspect it for a week. It was found that the shelter was originally a section of a tunnel about 15 to 20 kilometers long under the ground in Chongqing. According to the original plan, it was intended to be expanded to all parts of the city, but this process has been abandoned. Currently, only a few sections have been completed. The section where the tragedy occurred this time is about 460 meters long and has three entrances and exits. After the incident, the authorities temporarily closed it and improved it. It has now been completed and is ready for use. Currently, a 44-horsepower diesel engine is installed in the shelter to power the air circulation machine and electric lights. The shelter is about 15 feet wide and 8 feet high, all made of solid rock. Three rows of low benches are provided along the walls, which can seat 4,500 people. In the future, once it is full, the gendarmes at the entrance will no longer allow anyone to enter, and anyone will be prohibited from sitting or standing in the area within 50 feet of the entrance to avoid panic and facilitate the passage of air. According to reports from survivors and relevant authorities, the main cause of the tragedy was due to fleeing in panic, so the majority of the victims died at the entrance. Those who remained calm and motionless in the shelter were all rescued. Those in charge said that there were about 6,500 people in the shelter on the night of the incident. According to news from various sources, the course of the incident is as follows: After the first batch of Japanese planes dropped bombs and flew away, about 2,000 people who had taken refuge in the shelter left the shelter to breathe fresh air. After hearing the sound of the alarm, they rushed back into the shelter, resulting in many deaths from trampling. The entrance was partially blocked. The air raid lasted for several hours, and the air in the shelter gradually deteriorated, causing another rush from inside and outside, and many more people were crushed to death. At this point, the entrance was completely blocked. About 2,000 people left through a private air raid shelter connected to it, and another 2,000 people left after the entrance was cleared. Those who remained in the middle of the shelter were able to escape only after the bodies at each entrance were removed. The number of casualties rumored outside is too exaggerated. The number of people who took refuge in the shelter was only more than 6,000, but it was rumored that as many as 12,000 people died. The first count of the bodies at each entrance was 500, but the final inspection found that the number of deaths and injuries was between 1,200 and 1,500. In any case, it should not exceed this number. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

### Chinese and Australian Governments Will Exchange Envoys Immediately; Nominees for Minister Have Been Mutually Notified

Chongqing - The Chinese and Australian governments have mutually notified each other of the nominees for minister. Once they agree with each other, the two sides will formally announce the exchange of envoys (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

### Turkey Notifies the Soviet Union to Observe Neutrality

Moscow, 26th (Tass) - Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Aktan made the following statement to the Soviet People's Commissariat on the 25th: "The Turkish Embassy hereby declares to the Soviet People's Commissariat that the Turkish government has decided to announce Turkey's neutrality in the current Soviet-German succession."

London, 26th (Reuters) - The Turkish capital's wireless station claimed last night that the Turkish Congress unanimously approved the Turkish-German Treaty of Friendship yesterday. German Ambassador Papen also attended the Congress to observe. Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu said, "This treaty aims to adjust the relations between the two countries and shows that these relations will be developed with a friendly attitude in the future. It can be indicated by the precise stipulations of the existing obligations of the signatories and the validity of the old treaty. In our opinion, this provision means that Turkey's existing obligations, the most important of which is the Turkish-British alliance, remain unchanged. On this point, I think I should thank the German politicians for accepting our reservation to abide by the promises made to our allies, so that the tree of Turkish-German friendship can be established. This was the most important condition when conducting negotiations." Turkish Foreign Minister then elaborated on the process of the conclusion of the Turkish-German Treaty, saying that the negotiations and actions of both sides were quite correct and open. Furthermore, our side constantly notified our ally Britain of the important events in the development of the negotiations with Germany and repeatedly consulted with our ally Britain. Turkey's policy strives for fairness. "Now it is Slishchen who is entrusted to the belligerent countries, neutral countries, and even the world. In the face of the heroic Turkish army that defends our peace and on the same front, we unanimously adopt the position of defending Turkish peace. We will prove to the world with the future development of its activities and efforts that Turkey should indeed be in this glorious position."

### German Troops Break Through Northern Lines; Soviets Capture Biliyemys, Severing German Infantry and Tank Connection; German Forcible Crossing of the Prut River Repelled

TASS, Moscow, 26th—The Soviet Information Bureau today issued the following war report: "On the 25th, enemy mobile units attacked in the direction of Vilna and Baranovichy. The vast Soviet air force engaged the enemy tank formations in that area with great success. During the fighting, enemy tank detachments penetrated the Vilna and Ashmyany areas. Our forces, through active maneuvers and strong resistance, severed the enemy infantry from the tank units in that sector. The enemy attempted to break through in the direction of Brody and Lviv but encountered strong resistance from counter-attacking Red Army units. With the assistance of the great air force, the Red Army has inflicted heavy losses on the enemy's mechanized forces. The battle continues. After a rapid counter-attack, our troops have recaptured Biliyemys. In the Chernivtsi area, the enemy's attempt to forcibly cross the Prut River has been repelled. Along the Bessarabian line, the Red Army is firmly holding the east bank of the Prut River. The enemy has repeatedly attempted to cross, but all attempts have been repelled. In the Sculeni area, the enemy attempted to advance but suffered a disastrous defeat. The remnants were forced to retreat beyond the Prut River. Many German and Romanian soldiers were captured. Our air force bombed German airfields in Finland, Memel, enemy ships north of Liepāja, and the Constanța oil depots, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. On the 25th, 76 enemy planes were shot down, and 17 Soviet planes did not return to base." Note: Vilna is on the Lithuanian-Polish border.

Reuters, Moscow, 26th—Today's Soviet communiqué stated that although the northern front lines of Soviet troops in Soviet-occupied Poland were broken through by German tanks, Soviet troops captured Biliyemys (60 miles west of Lviv) to the south. Yesterday, German mobile units attacked Vilna and Baranovichy, 120 miles to its south. German tank formations penetrated the areas of Vilna and Ashmyany, 35 miles to its southeast, but Soviet ground forces severed the connection between German infantry and tanks. German forces attempted to advance towards Lviv and Brody, 55 miles to its northeast, and encountered strong resistance from counter-attacking Soviet land and air forces. German mechanized units suffered heavy losses. Fighting is currently ongoing.

United Press, London, 26th—Moscow official radio broadcast a war report from a Western front correspondent yesterday, stating that the Red Army, in a certain stronghold, took surprising action and annihilated a unit of German attacking forces. It also stated, "At dawn, under the cover of thick fog, the enemy crossed a wide river (location unspecified) in ten small boats. The German forces failed to achieve the effect of a surprise attack against the Soviets. The Soviet troops waited until the German forces approached, then suddenly launched a fierce bombardment against the Nazis. The majority of the enemy forces were killed on the spot, and the remainder were captured, including two officers."

United Press, Berlin, 26th—The High Command today issued a statement from the Führer's headquarters stating that the border fighting has ended, implying that they have penetrated deep into Soviet territory. The statement also said that German naval units also participated in the war against the Soviet Union, stating, "On the eastern front, both land and air operations yesterday proceeded according to plan. After the successful conclusion of border fighting in many areas, the great scope of German military success has begun to become apparent."

Reuters, London, 26th—Today, a Berlin spokesperson admitted that ending the war against the Soviet Union in the shortest possible time is of great importance to Germany. The German High Command has deployed all war organizations left in Germany to deal with the Soviet Union, and will disregard losses to achieve this important objective. The total number of German troops currently engaged in combat exceeds one million, with another million in reserve. The spokesperson also said that the number of aircraft used by Germany against the Soviet Union surpasses that of last year's French campaign. The Soviet Union has also mobilized most of its aircraft to cope with the fierce attacks by the German air force. It is reported that the losses on both sides are very heavy. According to the Soviet communiqué, in the first four days of the war, the German forces lost a total of 457 aircraft, while the Soviet Union lost 221.

Reuters, London, 26th—Today, German radio stations continue to claim that German troops are advancing, but they also broadcast accounts from eyewitnesses on the Eastern Front, all of whom admitted that German troops have had to engage in extremely fierce and bloody battles to advance, and acknowledged that the Soviet resistance and strategy have greatly exceeded German expectations. German broadcasts also admitted that Soviet troops have launched counter-attacks in various locations and achieved undeniable success. The Columbia Broadcasting System broadcast a dispatch from Ankara this morning stating that from East Prussia to Bukovina, German troops have launched equally fierce offensives against Soviet positions along eight routes. Two of these routes appear to be flanking maneuvers around the Baltic States and northern Bessarabia. No one can determine which of the eight routes is most important. At least two major routes have Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, as their ultimate goal. However, German troops have not yet found a weak point in the Soviet lines, so the German side must concentrate its maximum force and make every effort to attack the Red Army's defenses. A semi-official statement issued in Rome corrected expectations of a swift and lightning victory, saying that German operations against the Soviet Union are not without difficulties. The recently begun war is extremely complex because the front line is long and both sides have concentrated vast manpower and material resources to fight. German forces, particularly mechanized and armored units, must replenish their heavy consumption during the advance, which will make supply a very difficult problem. Furthermore, the German army must break through many Soviet fortresses and natural defenses. The German High Command, as usual, does not publish detailed reports at the start of the war. However, it is a fact that German troops are currently advancing.

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 26th—The local command announced yesterday the second communiqué, stating that in the three days of operation, the German-Romanian joint forces have proceeded according to pre-determined plans. Enemy aircraft bombed Constanța south, Galați, Tulcea, Brăila, and Jessi. Romanian aircraft and anti-aircraft guns shot down a total of 30 Soviet aircraft, destroyed 40 Soviet aircraft on the ground, and Romanian aircraft lost 12.

Heavy Fighting Between Two Armies in Four Key Areas Resembles Boxing Championship

Reuters, London, 26th—The Nazi blitzkrieg against Ukraine has entered its fifth day. According to reports from various sources, in several areas of the vast front, Soviet troops are currently retreating, either due to tactics or other reasons. In other areas, the German army is being slowed down by the Soviet Union's amassed troops and artillery. The advance has slowed, but the war is still in its early stages. Germany has not yet engaged the main Soviet forces. Yesterday, elite German troops fiercely attacked Soviet positions in four key areas. Elite Soviet troops retaliated fiercely, resembling two great boxers engaged in a fifteen-round steel standard match. After several minutes of exchanges, the battle began to rage. A dispatch from Reuters Rome stated that the Red Army is currently retreating to the old fortifications on the other side of the Dniester River, but the advancing German army is preventing Soviet troops from entering the positions to defend them. According to a dispatch from Budapest, a Hungarian government newspaper reported that the German army has entered Vilna, the ancient capital of Lithuania. A division of the Lithuanian "National Army" fighting alongside the German army prevented the Soviets from destroying two important bridges. Radio Rome broadcast a dispatch from Helsinki stating that thick smoke was seen billowing from the direction of Leningrad yesterday, burning fiercely, indicating that the city had been subjected to a major air raid or bombardment. According to a dispatch from a Swedish newspaper in Berlin, Berlin military circles stated that although the German army had tactically achieved a surprising victory and made great progress in several areas, so far it has only been the initial stage of a major battle that will occur when they encounter the main Soviet forces. It is expected that the German army will soon encounter the main Soviet forces. Berlin also stated that the scale of the German army is unprecedented in this decisive war, and perhaps in history. A dispatch from a Swedish newspaper in Berlin stated that concrete news about the war is expected to be obtained today. Yesterday's semi-official German news mentioned aircraft bombing Soviet transport and assisting army affairs, indicating that the German side is paying considerable attention to air warfare in this stage of the war against the Soviet Union. A German official news agency stated, "Bombers and fighters from a certain German Eastern Front squadron destroyed 280 Soviet tanks. The Eastern Front German Air Force also launched a large-scale operation to participate in land warfare, breaking through enemy resistance to facilitate the German advance. Whenever enemy tank armies appeared, they were attacked."

Soviets Strengthen Black Sea Submarine Fleet to Protect Red Army Supply Centers

Independent French News Agency supplement: According to information from Ankara, Soviet Navy Commander Admiral Kuznetsov has recently strengthened the Soviet submarine fleet in the Black Sea. Previously, the Soviets discussed whether defense of the Baltic Sea or the Black Sea should take priority, and ultimately decided that defense of the Caucasus, the Red Army's supply center, was more important. It is reported that the Soviets are currently building underground airfields in Ukraine to prevent aircraft from being destroyed on the ground.

American United Press, New York, 26th—Soviet radio reported in French that Soviet aircraft and anti-aircraft guns shot down 27 German aircraft, while the Soviets also lost 10 aircraft.

TASS, Moscow, 26th—During the first day of the war, young Soviet anti-aircraft gun crews lacked confidence in their shooting, but regained their form on the second day, shooting down nine aircraft in one day.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 26th—Local authorities revealed last night that on the third day of operations on the Eastern Front, German bombers continued to bomb Soviet railways and trains. On one railway line, 17 trains caught fire after being hit, and on another line, six trains were destroyed. Passenger cars were fully loaded with troops and munitions. Locomotives, rails, and stations were all destroyed. Another team of German aircraft assisted infantry in ground operations. Troop concentration points and supply columns were all bombed or strafed with machine guns. Many sections of rear supply routes were blocked by rubble.

### Full Text of National Financial Conference Declaration Released; Elaborating on Strengthening Wartime Economic Policies; Aiming for Financial Alignment with Military Affairs

Chongqing - The full text of the declaration from the Third National Financial Conference is as follows: "Our sacred War of Resistance and National Reconstruction will soon mark its fourth anniversary. After four years of arduous struggle, the foundation for recovery has been laid, and the dawn of victory is in sight. The entire nation is convinced that final victory will belong to us. However, the complexities of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction are manifold, and finance plays a crucial role. For the past four years, thanks to the dedicated efforts of the financial authorities in raising war funds, we have been able to meet our needs and promote construction while also paying attention to both immediate needs and long-term considerations, allowing the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction to advance simultaneously. However, in the future, the key to victory lies in the equal importance of economic and military affairs. Therefore, economic war expenditure will be extremely important in the future. Recognizing this, the central government specifically proposed and passed two proposals at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Executive Committee: one is (to improve the financial system, comprehensively organize and allocate resources to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and lay a self-sufficient foundation, so that national undertakings can achieve balanced development), and the other is (to adapt to wartime needs, temporarily transferring the field tax of each province to the central government for unified management and organization). With the principles established, implementation measures await exploration. Given the magnitude of the matter, it cannot be achieved without collective wisdom and broad input. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the central government's intentions, convened the Third National Financial Conference in June this year, aiming to mobilize the nation's financial and human resources to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and to jointly pursue the goal of (military affairs first, victory first). At the opening of the conference, the Chairman graced the occasion with his presence and delivered a speech, providing encouragement and appreciation. Although the President was preoccupied with military affairs, he still made time to personally deliver instructions, emphasizing the unification of national finance, the equalization of people's burdens, and the implementation of land and food policies, offering earnest encouragement. Letters and telegrams from various parties expressed high expectations for this conference. Feeling inspired, we recognized the importance of our mission even more. Fortunately, we have inherited from previous efforts and have made initial progress. During the eight days of the conference, we explored over a hundred proposals, and to provide a clear overview, we would like to present the following ten points to the nation: First, establish a national financial system, with the aim of unifying national finance and laying the foundation for a modern state. Second, establish an autonomous financial system, with the aim of promoting the new county system and laying the foundation for local autonomy. Third, reform taxation policies and systems, with the aim of organizing field tax, abolishing harsh taxes, and unifying collection to equalize the people's burdens. Fourth, implement food and land policies, with the aim of resolving military provisions, people's food, and equalizing land rights to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood. Other policies, such as financial policies, trade policies, and monopoly policies, also have resolutions, all aiming to align finance with military affairs to achieve final victory. I will now elaborate on each point as follows: (I) Establishing a national financial system: Since the implementation of the program for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, the responsibility of national finance has been extremely significant. Military expenditures are enormous, and construction projects require a large number of people. As the day of victory approaches, we should, under the principle of advancing both the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, concentrate our will and financial resources to enhance our enduring strength and seek the balanced development of national undertakings. To achieve this goal, we must adjust the financial system and coordinate operations to ensure unified progress and swift achievement. Based on the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, this conference conducted detailed discussions and determined the following guidelines as the future course: to determine the revenue and expenditure system, national financial revenue and expenditure are divided into two major systems: national finance and autonomous finance. Those that should be managed and distributed nationally are included in the national financial system, and those that should be adapted to local conditions are included in the autonomous financial system. The division of revenue and expenditure is carefully considered, taking into account both legal and practical aspects. Considering that poor counties may not be able to balance their revenue and expenditure, a subsidy system is also stipulated, so that the central government, in addition to raising the huge funds needed for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, also bears the heavy responsibility of regulating autonomous finance; (II) Provincial-level finance is incorporated into national finance. The original provincial revenue and expenditure are included in the national budget, and provincial-level budgets no longer exist. From now on, the central government will compile and review budgets based on the principles of unified coordination, so that internal and external resources can be integrated and surpluses and deficits can be adjusted; (III) Unified revenue and expenditure: All revenue belonging to national finance should be deposited into the national treasury, and all expenditure belonging to national finance should be disbursed by local financial institutions acting as agents of the national treasury in accordance with the law, so that financial revenue can be unified, expenditure can be rational, and financial resources can be concentrated, making circulation more flexible; (IV) Unified collection agencies: To provide ample tax revenue and balance the burden, it is necessary to improve the tax system and unify collection. It was decided to establish tax bureaus in counties across the country to collect national taxes and collect donations and taxes for autonomous finance, directly managed and supervised by the central government. The organization is unified, collection is simplified, and financial expenses can be reduced; (V) Unification of the debts of the provincial governments: All debts of the provinces will be taken over by the central government for reorganization. Debts are used by the state, which can increase their effectiveness, and debts are borne by the state, which can increase their credit. The original fund management organizations are abolished."

The spokesperson pointed out that Japan cannot decide whether to advance into Southeast Asia or attack inland China. Recent international developments have made Japan even more confused.

### Shanghai Student Association Cables Chongqing: Youth Should Unite to Fight for the Nation

Chongqing - According to Chinese reports, this place received a letter last night from the Shanghai Student Association addressed to the youth of the entire nation regarding the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, saying: "Fellow youth of the nation, the sudden outbreak of the Soviet-German war is a world-shaking event, sufficient to prove that the flames of the aggressors have spread to every corner of the world, and the banner of anti-aggression has been raised everywhere. The battle between the aggressors and those who resist aggression actually started with the incident four years ago. In these four years, the international situation has changed rapidly, and the world map has been repeatedly redrawn. However, our country, under the command of the supreme leader, has persisted in fighting, remaining steadfast, exchanging time for space, and responding to the ever-changing situation with constancy. The goal is nothing more than seeking the survival and freedom of the motherland. People across the country, at this critical moment of survival, can all understand the difficulties of the times, unite sincerely, contribute money and effort, and jointly face the national crisis. However, there are some people who have ulterior motives, deliberately undermine the authority of the central government, attempt to divide the strength of the nation, and promote internationalism in the hope of creating class struggle, even shouting the slogan 'Long live another motherland!' They even attack our country for joining hands with Britain and the United States, saying that this will change the nature of our country's war and turn it into an imperialist war. Now, these people suffering from infantile neurosis should probably wake up. Frankly speaking, hasn't the war in Europe been caused by the Soviet Union? If there had been no signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, where would Hitler get today's arrogance? Where would hundreds of millions of people in Europe suffer such bloodshed? Even in the Far East, if there had been no establishment of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact, Mao Zedong's meeting with Matsuoka in Moscow, and the obstruction by the Eighteenth Group Army directly commanded by the Chinese Communist Party, wouldn't our country have been able to achieve an unprecedented victory again in a short period in the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain? Diplomatic policy is the same in principle as friendship between private individuals. Only by firmly adhering to integrity can one always stand in an invincible position. Those who are cunning will inevitably suffer the consequences. Germany's attack on the Soviet Union this time can be said to be a lesson from the Soviet Union's consistent use of cunning diplomacy. We regret its past mistakes, and at the same time, we are pleased with its current awakening. As for whether joining Britain and the United States will turn it into an imperialist war, then just ask if the Soviet Union would be able to defeat the aggressors' attack if it did not receive the aid of Britain, the United States, and other sympathizers? Past facts and the most recent developments have gradually proven the absurdity of the rumors spread by these blindly following officials. In short, now only by everyone being loyal to the motherland and fighting for their own nation can they find a path to survival. Even the socialist Soviet Union, when its territory is invaded, can only unite the whole country and fight against the common enemy. Even the progressive elements within the Yan'an CCP have realized the importance of national victory and have begun to oppose those who betray the war effort. If at this time and place, there are still those who rely on some international background, engage in empty talk about new democracy, engage in propaganda that undermines unity, and harbor ambitions of creating division, then they are not only traitors to the motherland, but also unworthy descendants of the Soviet Union. Looking at the past and present, both domestically and abroad, the 'nation first' and 'national interest first' principles shown to us by the leader are indeed the only way to save the country. We can only concentrate our will and strength under the unified command of the leader to overcome the current great difficulties and establish a democratic nation, so that we are worthy of being descendants of the Yellow Emperor, children of China. At the same time, in the international arena, the leader made the statement some time ago that China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should establish a united front. The foresight and vision truly revealed an understanding of the world situation in the future. We hope that this strong united front can be quickly coordinated and completed to strike at those who strike and prevent the aggressive warmongers from displaying their skills. This is sufficient to realize world peace, which is already in sight. The dark period is about to pass. Human justice will once again be upheld. We wish our national liberation success, and we also wish all anti-aggression countries victory. We must unite strongly, work together, support the leader, obey the central government, and fight for the survival and freedom of the motherland to welcome this glorious arrival." (Dispatch, 16th)

### Siberian Route Disrupted; German Trade Suffers a Major Blow; Last Year, Imports to Shanghai Were Worth 4 Million USD; China's Exports to Germany Were Also Very Important; Shanghai Will Face Shortages of Medicines and Dyes

Reliable sources reported yesterday that after Nazi Germany's war with the Soviet Union, the route across Siberia was cut off, causing a major blow to Germany's trade with China, especially with Shanghai. Some German expatriates, hoping to return to Germany via the Soviet Union and waiting for approval from the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo, are now stranded in Shanghai and unable to travel.

Huge Amount of German Goods Shipped to Shanghai

During the last World War, German trade in China suffered severe setbacks, while the business of British and Allied firms prospered unprecedentedly. After the outbreak of this European war, Germany used the overland route across Siberia to transport goods to the east, so its trade volume was huge. Well-informed sources said that customs statistics do not reflect even half of the actual trade volume of German merchants in Shanghai. Last year, China imported German goods worth a total of 5,550,000 USD, of which Shanghai accounted for 4,530,000 USD.

Exports to Germany Are Also Considerable

As for China's exports to Germany, according to official figures, they were 245,000 USD, of which Shanghai accounted for 6,000 USD. The import figures are reliable, but the total value of Shanghai's exports to Germany is not accurate, because German merchants in Shanghai often entrust Chinese and Japanese merchants to act as agents, shipping goods to Germany via Siberia. The freight costs on the Trans-Siberian Railway are extremely high, but this does not significantly hinder German trade in China. Some valuable items, taking up very little space, can easily compensate for the expensive freight costs.

Japanese Agents Buy Chinese Products

China's imports from Germany have gradually increased, occupying a prominent position in the market here. Although official figures show a decrease in exports to Germany, superficially it seems that Germany can sell goods in China and obtain foreign currency, but it has failed to obtain the Chinese products it desperately needs. In fact, according to market surveys by economic and financial experts in this city, Chinese and Japanese firms here have purchased a large number of goods on behalf of Germany, proving that China's exports to Germany are by no means a negligible business.

German Merchants in South China Greatly Affected

As Germany's trade route to the East has changed, the transportation industries in Dalian, North China, and the Middle East Railway have become extremely prosperous. As a result of the southward expansion of the Sino-Japanese War, the business of German firms in South China has been greatly affected, unlike the prosperity of German firms here. This is because traffic between Hong Kong and the mainland has been blocked. Passengers traveling to Europe via Siberia must apply for the necessary visas from the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo, as Shanghai currently has no formal Soviet representative.

Medicine and Dye Prices Increase Sharply

Knu Chong, the Norwegian representative in China who was responsible for taking care of Soviet interests here until last month, told visitors that he now expects the Soviet Union to change its attitude towards Norway, that is, no longer recognize Norway as an independent country. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that it is no longer necessary to set up a Norwegian legation in Moscow. Also, the English-language China Press reported that, according to Chinese sources, one of the significant impacts on Shanghai after the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union is the sharp increase in the price of German medicines and dyes, as these items are expected to be in short supply.

### American Oil Tycoon's Son Donates to China

According to the China Weekly Review, which will be published tomorrow, a letter from Chongqing received in this port stated that as of the 9th of this month, there were a total of 177 requests from all over the country for assistance from the American Red Cross, involving 75 organizations in 11 provinces. Among them, the most were issued by organizations in Jiangsu Province, reaching 71. In order to actively assist China, the American people are currently initiating a fundraising campaign by the China Relief Society to raise 5 million USD by the end of July to be used as relief funds. This work is currently being chaired by Mr. Berle, and 1 million USD has already been raised. The largest donation among them is 50,000 USD from the son of oil tycoon Rockefeller. In addition, there are many donations ranging from 500 USD to 20,000 USD, all of whom are enthusiastic people who do not wish to be named.

### Visitors from Southwest China Discuss Sichuan-Xikang Water Conservancy

Visitors from Southwest China discussed that after the Sichuan Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau took charge of the water conservancy projects in Sichuan and Xikang, they first focused on farmland irrigation projects. In recent years, the constructed dams include the Santai Jiaozhe District. Recently completed are the Mianyang Longxi Canal and the Meichuan Liquan Canal. Projects about to be completed include the Ya'an Qingyi Canal and the Hongya Huahan Canal. Projects that have just started include the Suining Nanzhuang Dam and other six districts. After all are completed, 139,000 mu of land can be irrigated, with an annual increase in agricultural income of 22 million yuan and an increase in land tax revenue of 5.6 million yuan. The old dams that have been reorganized include the Mianyang Tianhuang Dam, Xinmingjing Yu Dam, Qingshen Hongdai Dam, Leshan Nanmu Dam, Jintang Beize Dam, Jianyang Xianweng Dam, Emei Xiongshan Dam, and other seven places, irrigating a total of 57,000 mu of land, with an annual increase in agricultural income of more than 5.8 million yuan and an increase in land price of more than 19 million yuan. The Mumadi area between Huayang and other five counties is currently being surveyed, and 300,000 mu of paddy fields can be developed in the future, with an annual increase in production of more than 100,000 shi. This plan turns barren land into fertile soil, which is beneficial to China's future. The water conservancy of the entire Xikang province is currently being planned in an all-round way and actively promoted. According to the implementation plan, hydrological stations are set up in Ya'an, Luojing, Fulin, Xichang, and Luding. Water separation stations are set up in Zhougonghe, Feixianguan, Lushan, Tianquan, Kangding, Xichang, Mianning, Wasigou, and other eight places, and separately observe the water level, velocity, flow, sediment content, rise and fall of the Qingyi River, Dadu River, and Anning River, as well as the complex changes of local rainfall temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind force, and wind direction. The government authorities are about to allocate funds to carry out water conservancy to dredge waterways.

### The People's Maternity and Children's Hospital Has Outstanding Achievements

Last month, 1,495 people were treated at the Shanghai People's Maternity and Children's Hospital, which was reorganized from the former Shanghai Refugee Maternity Hospital. It applies various facilities in obstetrics, which are slightly more complete than other ordinary hospitals. The staff, such as doctors, nurses, and midwives, have also received special obstetrical training. Therefore, every month, many patients with difficult labor or obstetrical complications are referred to the hospital by local hospitals or midwives. Last month, 18 pregnant women were diagnosed and treated at the hospital for the above-mentioned diseases. Thanks to the dedicated service of the hospital staff, all have recovered, and no misfortunes have occurred. Last month, the hospital treated a total of 1,495 patients, of which 158 were hospitalized for childbirth, and the rest were outpatients.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Has Made Appropriate Modifications to the Electricity Saving Measures; Generous Allocations of Electricity for Cinemas, Etc.; New Investors Will Also Receive Proportional Allotments

According to a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Council has considered the objections raised to the report of the "Committee on Limiting Electricity Supply." The important objections that have been considered are: (1) Opposition to the allocation of small amounts of electricity to luxury businesses and entertainment venues (compared to the allocation of electricity to industrial categories); (2) Objections raised due to the serious impact felt by authorizing the Shanghai Power Company to refuse to accept new electricity connection applications.

Very Little Saving, No Distinction Should Be Made

After carefully considering the objections and the reasons for the special committee's allocation of electricity, the Council decided that until the available coal supply drops below 25,000 tons per month, there should be no distinction in the allocation of electricity to users in categories 5, 6, 7, and 8. This is because the electricity consumption of categories 6, 7, and 8 combined accounts for only 4.4% of the total electricity consumption of all categories, and the amount reduced from the allocation of electricity to the industrial category after additional allocation to these users is only 1% or less. Editor's Note: "Category 5" listed in the report of the "Committee on Limiting Electricity Supply" is for cotton mills, various metal manufacturing plants, shipbuilding plants, chemical and rubber plants, and those who use power to produce products. The original provision was a 70% reduction. "Category 6" includes brewing, baking, confectionery, cosmetics, wireless electricity, photography, barber shops, and beauty salons, etc. "Category 7" is for billboards and special bright lights. "Category 8" includes cinemas, theaters, and dance halls, etc. The original provisions for the above 6, 7, and 8 categories were all a 75% reduction.

New Applications Will Be Accepted As Appropriate

The objections raised by citizens or companies who invested in the installation of new machines or the expansion of existing machines before March 4 of this year have also been considered. They invested in the hope of obtaining a supply of electricity. The Council believes that a portion should be allocated according to their needs. It has been decided to modify the method of refusing to accept new electricity connection requests in order to accept requests for the installation of metered electricity and small amounts of electricity. However, the applicant must prove: (1) That the building was started on or before March 4 of this year; (2) That the equipment using electricity was ordered on or before March 4 of this year. Requests handled in accordance with this provision should be sent to the Shanghai Electric Power Company before July 5 of this year for review. The Council's decision can be found in a separate announcement today.

### Over Seventy Thousand Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived Yesterday; Public Granary Rice to be Sold at Fixed Price; First Batch of Granary Rice, 27,000 Bags, Expected to Arrive on the 2nd of Next Month and Will Immediately be Available for the Market

The Shanghai Food Rice Public Granary, initiated and organized by Mr. Yu Qiaqing and enthusiastic individuals from various sectors of this city, has spared no effort in raising funds and procuring rice since its establishment. It has been learned that the first batch of small Ngwe rice, amounting to 2,715 tons (equivalent to 27,150 bags), ordered by the public granary, has been shipped from Rangoon by the "Grant" vessel and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on July 2nd. This rice was ordered at the end of March, but due to delays in shipping schedules, the arrival of the goods was delayed. However, the price of rice and shipping costs at that time were lower than the current prices.

Public Granary Rice to be Sold to the Authorities First

The Public Granary Management Committee has resolved to sell all the rice to the Shanghai Municipal Council, following the method used by the Hong Kong government for selling small broken rice. The Municipal Council will then entrust rice shops to sell the rice to local consumers at a fixed price of no more than 110 yuan per picul for personal consumption. It has been decided that the surplus profits obtained after the public granary rice arrives and the subsequent batches of fixed rice arrive and are sold will be used for public welfare projects in this city. The specific measures will be announced after the accounts are closed at the end of the year and a meeting is held to make a decision. As for the accounts of the public granary, they must be audited every three months according to regulations. The first quarterly accounts ending at the end of March this year were previously audited by the accountants Mr. Xu Yongzuo and Mr. Tang Sheng and were officially published in newspapers in April. The second quarterly accounts ending at the end of June this year were also decided upon at the 7th regular meeting of the Public Granary Management Committee on the 23rd of this month and will be entrusted to the above two accountants for auditing and then published.

Over Seventy Thousand Bags of Rice Arrived Yesterday

A large quantity of foreign rice at fixed prices arrived in Shanghai through the Shanghai Municipal Council. The "Dart" vessel of the Wah Lun Shipping Company, directly from Rangoon, transported 5,850 tons, approximately 58,500 bags, which arrived yesterday and docked at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is reported that the "Grant" vessel also loaded a large quantity of foreign rice from Rangoon for the Shanghai Municipal Council and is expected to arrive on the 2nd of next month. The "Hanyang" vessel of the Taikoo Company arrived from Hong Kong the day before yesterday with 10,000 bags of foreign rice, which is also the fixed-price rice of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The "Tjitaroem" of the Java Mailboat Company, a new vessel, arrived yesterday afternoon from Java with 10,000 bags of foreign rice, which was unloaded at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong.

Over Thirty Thousand Bags of Hong Kong Rice Distributed Yesterday

Yesterday, the Lap Kee Foreign Firm distributed the Hong Kong rice that had already arrived to various miscellaneous grain stores, totaling 35,000 bags, and instructed them to distribute it to the rice shops immediately. Therefore, most rice shops obtained sufficient Hong Kong rice yesterday for retail sales. The number of applications from rice shops to the Lap Kee Foreign Firm for the distribution of Hong Kong rice yesterday was also reduced to over 6,000 bags, and the total number of delivery orders paid for and collected from the Xiang Mao Foreign Firm was only over 1,000 bags for the whole day.

Strictly Prevent Fixed-Price Rice from Flowing into Nanshi

Although the Public Concession authorities had previously received a joint request from most rice merchants in Nanshi to distribute Hong Kong rice for sale in that area, it was not approved due to the special circumstances of the area. Therefore, the price of rice in Nanshi is higher than in the Concession. It has recently been learned that some rice merchants in Nanshi are indirectly purchasing foreign rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council from rice merchants in the extraterritorial road area for sale in that area to make profits. This action has now attracted the attention of the authorities, and strict management measures will be implemented for the rice shops in the extraterritorial road area to prevent abuses.

### Increasing Demand in South China; Shanghai Factories Active

The "China Press" reported that Shanghai factories have recently been reducing their production due to the blockade of the eastern Zhejiang coast, which has reduced the supply of raw materials and electricity. However, due to the easing of the situation in the Pacific and the increasing demand for commercial products in the South Seas, Shanghai factories have increased their production to meet this demand. Currently, there are 64 textile factories in this city, and the number of other local goods factories has not decreased.

### Fox to Come to Shanghai; Inspect Shanghai's Economic Situation; Four Members of the Stabilization Fund Depart in Different Directions; Chen Guangfu and Bei Sung-sun Go to Kunming Together

Since the US-China loan was established and the Stabilization Fund Management Committee was established in China, it was decided to maintain currency credit and foreign exchange with all efforts, and to appropriately maintain the Shanghai black market foreign exchange. The exchange rate of the legal tender against the US dollar and the British pound can be stably maintained for a long time, which can increase China's foreign trade. The general headquarters of the committee is located in Chongqing, and offices are also set up in Hong Kong and other places. After a meeting, in order to investigate the economic situation in various places, it has been decided to send Chairman Chen Guangfu, Member Bei Sung-sun, to Kunming, Member Rogers to Hong Kong, Member Fox to Shanghai to inspect the economic situation in various places, and Member Xi Demao to stay in Chongqing to handle the affairs of the committee. It is reported that the committee's financial reserves have become increasingly abundant and can cope with everything, and effective measures have been taken to eliminate speculation in the black market and the seizure of foreign exchange by conspirators. Various friendly banks have decided to do their best to assist the committee's stabilization work. American Citibank and British HSBC and other banks have agreed to cooperate fully with the committee.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Announces Measures to Prevent Flooding; Fundamental Solution Requires Burying Large-Scale Underground Channels; But Cannot be Realized Due to Economic Constraints; Currently, New Possible Flood Prevention Measures are Being Implemented One by One

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued an announcement yesterday, explaining the situation of flood prevention measures, saying that in recent years, the public has suffered inconvenience due to the accumulation of water in this city. It is believed that the outside world has doubts about what preventive measures the Municipal Council has taken or at least tried to control.

Fundamental Solution Difficult to Achieve for the Time Being

It has been found that the ground in this city is low-lying, and if we want to completely eliminate the danger of water accumulation, we must bury large-scale new underground channels in almost every road, so that the water can flow into special pumping stations. These pumping stations can quickly drain water under any tide, just like collecting water. However, the above-mentioned plan to bury channels will take ten years to complete. During the burial, the impact on transportation will be significant, and the cost will be huge, which is difficult to raise even in peacetime. Therefore, the Public Works Department has explored several more practical methods.

Cleaning of Underground Channels Has Not Been Neglected

In 1939, the Public Works Department's usual cleaning of underground channel equipment was added and concentrated on the main hub of a certain system of underground channels within the boundary, and a specially manufactured machine was used to quickly remove the silt from the larger water pipe doors. As a result, the main underground pipes were completely cleaned by the end of the same year. This cleaning situation has been maintained to this day.

High Tides and Heavy Rains are Most Likely to Cause Water Accumulation

Certain areas are most prone to water accumulation. The causes of water accumulation have been investigated separately, and effective measures have been taken to reduce the possibility of water accumulation. When water accumulation cannot be prevented, efforts are made to reduce the affected area and reduce the depth and duration of water accumulation. Excessive high tides and excessive rainfall are factors that cause flooding. Some areas accumulate water due to high tides, while other areas overflow due to heavy rains. High tides and heavy rains often occur at the same time.

Low-Lying Roads Have Been Raised

Several years ago, the section of ground between Henan Road and the Bund often accumulated water due to high tides. Not only was there no drainage, but also the channel water backflowed and overflowed the road surface. Therefore, the first step was to renovate and raise the road surface. However, this work hindered traffic, and the cost of each road was the highest. Therefore, the renovation work was suspended after 1936. At the same time, non-return valves were installed at the mouths of the sewers in the area to prevent water from flowing into the area and allow it to drain outwards.

Dike Walls Installed Along the Bund

A cement dike wall has been added along the Bund, and the entrances and exits leading to the docks have been filled in, as well as several methods to prevent river water from flowing back. In addition, a pump has been installed to drain the channel water when the sewer mouths are blocked by the tide. All of this has reduced the annual road water accumulation by more than 100 times when the Jiang tide rises above the road surface. At present, the only opportunity for flooding occurs when the river water rises and flows into the area through the French Concession Bund, or due to heavy rain during the high tide period. (To be continued)

### Police Situation Last Month

Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department handled a total of 2,279 criminal cases, an increase of 53 cases compared with April. At the same time, 2,021 criminals were arrested. In addition, 124 criminals who committed crimes in the previous months and 17 criminals arrested on behalf of official agencies outside the boundary were sent away together. A total of 147 people who committed crimes using firearms were arrested, and 40 firearms, along with a large number of ammunition, were seized. A total of 15 strikes occurred, affecting 460 workers. The total number of workers employed in factories in the extraterritorial road area of the Public Concession is estimated to be 227,50. The inspection of Chinese newspapers is still ongoing. A certain tabloid was fined 40 yuan by the court on May 9 for publishing obscene words. Eight major newspapers were warned by letter for publishing words that should not be published.

### British Tramway to Increase Prices Again from Tomorrow; The Increase Reaches 50 Percent; Public Bus Price Increase Still Under Discussion

The British Tramway Company of the Public Concession previously submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council to approve the increase of tram fares, which is calculated to increase the average first-class fare from 6.37 cents per mile to 9.11 cents, and the average third-class fare from 4.87 cents per mile to 7.29 cents. It has been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors at the regular meeting on the 11th of this month.

Tram Fares Increased by 5

The company has decided to implement the approved increase from the 28th of this month. The distribution of fares at each station will be increased by 50 percent uniformly for each section station. Monthly season tickets will also be increased in price at the same time.

Public Bus Price Increase Case to be Decided

At 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council held a board meeting to discuss the British Public Bus's request to increase fares again and the electricity of the cinema. Regarding the former question, the result of the discussion was published by the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office yesterday, saying, "The bureau has considered the case of the Chinese Public Bus Company applying to amend the fare schedule. At the same time, the bureau and the company are continuing to discuss it."

### Japanese Arrest Chinese in Lloyd Road

At 8:10 p.m. last night, plainclothes Japanese personnel, riding in a military license plate car (number unknown), went to the second floor of the Jin Kang Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 30 Lloyd Road in the Public Concession, and arrested a man from Guangdong, Mr. Shen. He was immediately taken to Hongkou. It is said that when the Japanese went to Lloyd Road to arrest people, a Chinese young woman led the way.

### American President Lines Announces Baggage Regulations; Keeps Monthly Transit Schedule Secret; Soviet Ships Sailing Along the Coast are Temporarily Unhindered

Since seven ships of the American President Lines were requisitioned for military use, the schedule was rearranged and the names were kept secret. After taking the above step, the number of voyages was reduced, and each ship carried a large number of passengers. Therefore, it was necessary to revise the baggage and cargo transportation methods, and a notice was issued yesterday.

Newly Revised Baggage and Cargo Transportation Methods

The notice stated, "Passengers must pay attention to the following important baggage regulations. First-class cabins are limited to 350 pounds, tourist cabins are limited to 250 pounds, and third-class cabins are limited to 175 pounds. An extra fee of 5 cents per pound will be charged for exceeding the limit. Baggage only includes clothing, toiletries, and other travel items for the same purpose. All commodities, banknotes, bonds, official documents, manuscripts, photos, coins, gold bars, jewelry, silverware, ornaments, or other valuables must not be packed in baggage and must not be regarded as baggage. Also, camphor wood boxes, tea tables, short stools, boxes, baskets, wooden boxes, cargo tubes, and furniture are not baggage and will be treated as cargo. The above regulations must be strictly enforced due to passenger congestion. As for the freight of the above-mentioned goods, please inquire at the company at No. 51 Guangdong Road."

President Pierce Returning to Shanghai

After the company revised its schedule, it is reported that the first mail ship to sail from Shanghai to the United States will be the President Pierce, which is scheduled to return from Manila on the 4th of next month and arrive here. After staying in Shanghai for one night, it will set sail directly for Honolulu, San Francisco to report, and it is expected to arrive on July 22nd. The ships sailing from Shanghai to the United States again are only in the last week of August and the last week of September. The company stipulates that the ships sailing south from the United States via Shanghai are in the second week of August and the last week of August and the second week of September. According to the above regulations, there are indeed two voyages per month through Shanghai.

Four Cargo Ships Arriving in Shanghai One After Another

Other ships that are not managed and represented by the American President Lines will be American merchant ships. These ships are handled by the Tiansheng Foreign Firm, the Fulai Foreign Firm, the Overseas Chinese Foreign Firm, and the cargo ships represented by the company. It is reported that a total of three American merchant ships are expected to arrive in Shanghai this week. Their tonnage is between 3,000 and 4,000 tons. (1) The Langanbaite, represented by the American President Lines, is carrying goods from New York, San Francisco, and Honolulu. The ship arrived at 5 pm last night. (2) The Xihuaque, also managed by the company, is coming to Shanghai from New York via the Panama Canal and Little Luzon, and is expected to arrive here on the 29th of this month. (3) Another ship, the Bode, is also coming to Shanghai from Little Luzon on the same day. (4) The Flede Land, managed by the Fulai Foreign Firm, is carrying goods from Seattle to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th of this month. The ship is the second new cargo ship of the Fulai Company and is making its maiden voyage to Shanghai, and is scheduled to dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou.

Soviet Ships Sailing are Not Hindered

There are currently four Soviet ships being repaired in Shanghai. The whereabouts of these ships are now awaiting orders. However, the Soviet ships Maytop, Xilenga, and Texibo, after being repaired at the Taikoo Shipyard in Hong Kong, have decided to sail to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tianjin within two weeks. Although the German-Soviet war broke out suddenly, the Soviet Union and Japan have a commercial treaty relationship, and Soviet ships sailing in the Far East are not hindered. The above-mentioned three ships are directly under the jurisdiction of the Soviet Union Maritime Authority.

### Da Guangming Theater Ticket Scalping Case; Five People Arrested

The Da Guangming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road previously had a strike due to collusion between the ticket collector and the ticket scalper. Three criminals were arrested and sent to the Special First Court. After interrogation, it was found that there were many ticket collectors and ticket sellers at large, and they were ordered to be arrested. Later, detectives from the New Gate Patrol Station arrested the ticket seller Qin Jilin, the ticket collector Jin Guanzhong, Shen, Lin Chengfu, and Wu Yin, and detained them in the patrol station. They were sent to the Special First Court yesterday morning. The patrol station lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit according to law. The defendants hired lawyer Xu Jie to appear in court to defend them. The court ordered that the case be re-examined at a later date.

### Heavy Rain and Tidal Backflow the Day Before Yesterday; Public Transportation Obstructed; More Than 260 Millimeters of Rain Measured; Pacific Hurricane Stalled

The heavy rain the day before yesterday was most rapid after evening. The entire Shanghai was submerged in heavy rain. According to the record of the Xujiahui Observatory, the rainfall was most intense from 5:45 a.m. to 6:45 a.m. and from 7:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. The total rainfall in the 24 hours from 5:00 a.m. the day before to 5:00 a.m. yesterday was 161.4 millimeters, which was the largest rainfall this year. The roads were all flooded. Starting yesterday morning, the water gradually receded, but the sky was still cloudy. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the new hurricane in the Pacific Ocean had reached between 127 degrees east longitude and 15 degrees north latitude at 5:00 a.m. yesterday, but it had stalled, so its direction was unclear. After the rain yesterday, the climate in this city was quite cool. Because the sky was cloudy in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the weather was still difficult to clear.

Traveling Vehicles Like Sailing Boats

There are many places with water accumulation in the Concession. In the Public Concession, roads such as Zhejiang Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Maho Road, Racecourse Road, Guizhou Road, and Guangxi Road, and in the French Concession, roads such as Albert Road, Luban Road, Sacred Heart Road, Sappho Road, Avenue Joffre, Wangzhi Road, and Maysi Road, etc., were all flooded to the ankles, and people had to wade through the water. The public vehicles in the two Concessions, the British 12 Road trams in the Public Concession, headed west to the intersection of Hart Road and turned around. Other trams and public buses traveled through the water, splashing waves, like sailing boats in a watery country. The French Tram Company, except for the public buses on the 12 and 178 roads and the trolleybuses on the 17 and 18 roads, which operated as usual, the trolleybuses on the Gan Road and the trams on the 1, 2, 5, 7, and 10 roads were temporarily suspended. The engineering offices of the two Concessions yesterday assigned workers to dredge the sewers on the low-lying roads to allow the accumulated water to flow smoothly so that vehicles could resume traffic.

Commercial News

### Securities; Bulls' Attitudes on Public Bonds Ambiguous; Selling High, Buying Low; Stock Market Trends Also Active

In the unofficial market for public bonds yesterday, both type C and type E bonds reached new high prices in the morning. Type C was not far from 74 yuan, which aroused some bulls to come out. Although the bulls in the financial sector and large accounts were still brave, the bulls in the financial sector and large accounts on the other side were also quite willing to come out, so the market was quite dazed. If they wanted to sell high, they would slow down; if they wanted to enter low, they would have to increase. Buying and selling transactions often could not be concluded, which shows that people's hearts were slightly dazed. Taking type C as an example, it rose from 3 yuan 67 cents to 3 yuan again, then shrank to 2 yuan 60 cents, and then rose to 3 yuan 60 cents and a half to close. The range of ups and downs was very large, which shows the enthusiasm of both buyers and sellers. Yesterday morning, Yi Tai, Xinfu, and Yongchang bought in, and Xing Yuan entered the stomach was still strong. Lianhe and Lianyi Runli sold out more. Type C opened at 2 yuan 80 cents and rose to 3 yuan 70 cents. In the middle, it fell from 3 yuan 20 cents to 2 yuan 60 cents, and then rose to 3 yuan 60 cents and a half to close. The range of ups and downs was extremely large, which shows the enthusiasm of both buyers and sellers. Type E also saw a new high price of 1 yuan 60 cents. In the afternoon, the market suddenly flashed. The opening price was 3 yuan 70 cents, and it was only 50 cents to sell, and it immediately broke through 3 yuan. After several times in and out of 3 yuan, the result was still closed outside 3 yuan. Yi Tai, Xinfu, and Yongchang continued to buy in, and Renchang Wengfeng also bought in. Lianhe and Lian continued to sell out. Bei also sold out a lot. Yongkang and Tongkang always sought to sell. Hu Heji, representing a certain bank, also sold a lot. The buying and selling parties were evenly matched, and the supply was more than the demand, so the market rose again by 40 cents to 90 cents. The transaction volume of type D was the smallest, rising only 10 cents. The transaction volume was 2.56 million yuan. A brief table is listed below. In the stock transaction, 50 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of 20 yuan and 5 cents.

The transaction volume of public industrial stocks was extremely large, and the trend was exceptionally active. The opening price was average, but later, stimulated by political news, the market continued to rise. Of course, there were sometimes reactions in between, but a kind of continued purchase was enough to offset it.

The 21st shareholders' meeting of the British Zhanghua Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by the British Huatong Foreign Firm, will be held on July 18. The company's net profit for 1940 was as high as 2.56 million yuan in national currency. In addition to the interim dividend of 3 yuan per share in national currency that has been paid, it is planned to continue to pay 2 yuan per share in national currency, for a total of 5 yuan in national currency for the whole year.

### Finance The American Bank Greatly Provides Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates remain flat across the board. The unofficial British and American exchange rates shifted from a loosening to a flat trend. In the morning, American banks, including Citibank and Chase, suddenly showed a willingness to supply, while the intention to cover short positions dwindled. As a result, the forward month U.S. dollar rate of 5.4175 yuan and the near-term rate could be settled successively. The British gold rate followed suit, depreciating to 3 shillings and 328125 pence. In the afternoon, due to the approach of the end of the month, speculators eagerly covered short positions, causing the previous loosening of the two exchange rates to completely revert to flat. The final rate matched the closing price of the previous day. Trading was active, with Chinese merchants covering tens of thousands of U.S. dollars.

Small Settlements by Importers

Since the morning, foreign telegrams indicated that spot silver in the silver market was also seeing longer positions. Futures and the silver market in the United States and Britain remained flat. Exchange rates in various countries, including the United States and Britain, remained consistent without change. The central bank's listed rates remained flat across the board. The opening price for domestic banks was a selling price, with the spot British exchange rate at 3 shillings and 3125 pence and the U.S. dollar at 5.40625 yuan. Few Chinese merchants and speculators dared to enter the market. Citibank's offer to settle the next month's U.S. dollar at 5.4375 yuan revealed a hardening trend. HSBC's listed rates remained flat. The silver equalization tax was levied at 24.25%. Chase, an American bank, also sold June futures at 5.4375 yuan. Importing firms made small settlements, and the trend later became stagnant. At noon, the British gold rate hardened back to 3 shillings and 328125 pence, and the U.S. dollar to 5.4375 yuan.

Chinese Merchants Cover June U.S. Dollars

In the afternoon, Chinese merchants and speculators vigorously covered June U.S. dollars at 5.4375 yuan. The willingness to supply of American and other foreign banks weakened, causing the situation to become tighter. The July futures and the U.S. exchange rate also softened. At the 3:30 PM closing, the spot to July futures British exchange rate was 3 shillings and 3125 pence, and the U.S. dollar was 5.40625 yuan, both the same as the noon closing price of the day.

### Securities Firms Jointly Enter the Market; Gold Market Rises Sharply

Yesterday, the gold market was volatile in the unofficial market, continuing to rise. The price has soared to around the 6,400 yuan mark. The confidence of various parties in a downward direction gradually began to waver. It is the end of the month, and although foreign exchange speculators can postpone positions to the next month, some inevitably covered positions, shifting from loose to tight. From the morning opening, the market trended firm. Due to the supply of American banks, the U.S. exchange rate slightly loosened, and Guang Hengji came to sell, causing a brief period of fatigue. Amid unfavorable rumors, the price retreated to 6,370 yuan, where it was absorbed by securities firms and draft merchants. It gradually rebounded. In the afternoon, as foreign exchange shifted from loose to flat, even more securities firms jointly absorbed, cut losses, and rose sharply, soaring to 6,405 yuan. Xinfeng Yongmeng sold, causing a slight retreat, but the closing still saw an increase of 18 yuan. The after-hours price rebounded again. Total trading for the day exceeded 10,000 taels. For swap trades (transferring from June to July), sellers offered to pay buyers from 62 yuan, calling up to 68 yuan. The cash price rose by over 20 yuan. Xianghe sold 100 taels to jewelers at a price 350 yuan higher than the futures price. The price of jewelry gold remained unchanged.

Once Outside the 400 Yuan Mark

Since the morning, the market was heard at 9:15 AM at 6,390 yuan per bar (ten taels), an increase of ten yuan. Hengji sold again when the price rose. Deda, Xinfeng, and Yong also followed suit, selling successively. Foreign exchange could be settled because the American bank released near-month U.S. dollars at 5.4375 yuan. The price gradually decreased by twenty yuan. At 10:15 AM, the price retreated to 6,370 yuan. Dafeng, Yida, Ren Cheng, and Yong Lai bought in, so the price gradually rose to 6,395 yuan. Silver banks and retail investors released, and at noon, the price retreated again to the noon closing price of 6,380 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 PM in the afternoon at 6,275 yuan, a decrease of five yuan. Gongda, Yida, Deda, Futong, Kangyong, and other securities firms vigorously entered the market successively, and the foreign exchange market tightened. Short positions also came to cover, and the price was seen to move outside the 6,400 yuan mark, reaching 6,405 yuan. Only after Xinfeng Yong made a huge sale did the price retreat slightly to 6,396 yuan. The market closed at 3:30 PM at 6,398 yuan, an increase of eighteen yuan from the previous day's noon closing price. Based on the settlement price of the July U.S. dollar at 5.40625 yuan, the price was 6,400 yuan plus 2 yuan, a discount of 44 yuan. The closing price recovered to 6,403 or 4 yuan. The difference for the whole day was fifteen yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own-brand gold was 360 yuan higher than the spot futures price, and the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. Bid prices were unavailable and there was no market.

Jewelry Gold Prices Unchanged

The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged at 695 yuan at Datongxing and Xintongxing. The purchase price was reduced by 40 yuan.

### Grain 70,000 Bags of Rice Arrived Yesterday; Large Quantities Still En Route to Shanghai; Rice Prices Fluctuate but Return to Flat

A large amount of foreign rice arrived on the Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship from Hanyang via Hong Kong the day before yesterday (the 15th). 9,998 bags of foreign rice transshipped from Rangoon to Shanghai were docked at the foreign bank wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Unloading began yesterday. The Java Company's new mail ship, Zhizhayun Jia, arrived yesterday morning, carrying 10,000 bags of foreign rice and 10,000 bags of corn from Java. It docked at the Pudong Lanyancong wharf for unloading. In addition, the Huahlun Foreign Company's Deta ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying a large amount of foreign rice directly from Rangoon, totaling 58,500 bags. It docked at the Pudong Hongsheng wharf for unloading. This rice is the Bureau of Public Works' subsidized foreign rice. The foreign rice loaded on the Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship from Hong Kong is also the Bureau of Public Works' cargo. A large amount is still continuing to arrive in Shanghai. (Zu)

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice again showed a fluctuating trend. The market opened in the morning, following the weak trend of the previous day. The prices of both futures and spot goods continued to decline consistently, falling by another one to one and a half yuan from the previous day. This was due to the cautious outlook of speculators, the continuous arrival of goods, and the assurance of the Hong Kong Rice Public Sale to replenish supplies. Although there was no announcement of firm orders, direct transactions continued uninterrupted. Therefore, some long positions sought to sell. No. 1 Saigon rice fell from 128 yuan to 126 yuan, and slightly lower rice from 115.3 yuan to 114.5 yuan. No. 1 rice was 121 yuan, and slightly lower rice 116.5 yuan. Broken rice was 98 yuan to 97.5 yuan, and slightly lower rice 94 yuan. High Siamese rice was 132 yuan to 130 yuan, and No. 2 rice was 115 yuan. Small ground rice was 123.5 yuan to 122.5 yuan, and then to 121.5 yuan. After the price stabilized, local customers slightly inquired. Inland gangs from Zhejiang successively increased their orders. High-quality goods had a more active outlet, and the calling price rebounded. The market immediately turned from weak to tight. Subsequently, floating speculators and retail investors seized the opportunity to push prices up, manipulating each other. The prices were seen to climb back step by step. As a result, after rising and falling, they eventually returned to the original level. The closing prices were still 128 yuan to 116 yuan for No. 1 Saigon rice, 121 yuan for No. 2 rice, 128.5 yuan to 128 yuan for high-quality茄佛rice, 115.5 yuan for No. 2 Siamese rice, 123 or 124 yuan for small ground rice, and 97 or 98 yuan for broken pointed rice. Yinghua Company did not dare to sell cheaply yesterday after the price of returned cargo had decreased the day before. The decline was slow. No. 1 Siamese rice was 139 yuan for June and July, 148 yuan for current small grain, 148.5 yuan to 147.5 yuan for road cargo, and 115 yuan for current broken rice, 115.5 yuan to 115.2 yuan for road cargo, then 112.5 yuan, and 114 yuan for futures. Transactions totaled over 1,000 tons, and spot goods totaled 14,000 bags due to customer demand.

Thick and thin japonica domestic rice had been scarce to flat since the previous dynasty. Yesterday, it was still scarce and lacked change. Fresh early and late rice from Southern ports was 136 yuan to 133 yuan, and original bagged overnight japonica rice from Wuxi was 130 yuan to 128 yuan.

Glutinous rice was out of season and had poor sales. However, the supply from Hong Kong had been interrupted for a long time, and the market inventory was weak. Sellers were not eager to sell, and the selling price remained firm. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened high at 122 yuan, settling at 117 or 118 yuan. High-quality glutinous rice opened at 113 yuan, settling at 106 yuan. However, domestic glutinous rice was weak and could not withstand the hot weather. The weather was sultry, and both buyers and sellers were discouraged. Sales were sluggish, and the market price had fallen below the Hong Kong dollar, opening at only 120 yuan, then 118 yuan.

### Flour Market Still Fluctuating

The price of foreign flour tended to fluctuate, and speculators were quiet. Local sales were still being made by Chinese factories selling flour cheaply. Demand was not strong, so the market was dull. The Jinlong flour brand was the hottest. Because there were many floating positions, some selling occurred, and the selling price decreased by a small amount of 3 or 4 cents. It is estimated that 1,500 bags were sold from the local street at a price of 31.6 or 7 yuan. There were inquiries about the real sale of the American Battery brand flour. It initially opened at 32.5 yuan, but immediately rebounded to 32.8 yuan, with 500 bags sold each. The wheat market remained stagnant.

In addition to the foreign rice that the Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship brought from Hong Kong for the Bureau of Public Works, there were also 20,350 bags of flour. Unloading began yesterday.

### Soybeans Dare Not Speculate; Rumors Abound of Northeastern Soybeans Shipping to Shanghai

The price of soybeans continued to decline sharply yesterday. Rumors of Northeastern soybeans shipping to Shanghai were widespread, causing general speculators to feel quite annoyed. They frequently lowered prices to sell, and the market price fell by another half to one yuan. It is estimated that 100 bags of Tianjin Jin Yuan soybeans and 100 bags of green soybeans were sold. 600 bags of Guide yellow soybeans, 300 bags of Qingdao yellow soybeans, and 200 bags of Jiaozhou yellow soybeans were also sold. (See the market price column for details) 100 pieces of raw oil arrived yesterday from Tianjin. On the 27th, 1,155 bags of exported soybeans and 2,488 pieces of soybean cakes will be shipped to Singapore.

Yesterday's corn market saw speculators stop selling and remain on the sidelines. There was slight activity from the Hangzhou gang, so sentiment improved and the price rose by about half a yuan. It is estimated that seven carts, totaling 1,000 bags, of Saigon and Dutch corn were sold.

### Yarn and Cotton The Cotton Yarn Market Profit-Taking Reverses; Trend Pauses; More Cotton Yarn Shipping to Hong Kong Today

The yarn market began to rise but then weakened, but the trend made people hesitate. This was because sales of current yarn had slowed. Rumors suddenly spread in the market that a Cantonese gang had faced obstacles in shipping yarn from Hong Kong. It was said that the gang would sell out. However, according to this newspaper's advertisement for the Wah Shing Silver Company yesterday, the words "five corners commission" per hundred American bills were mistakenly printed as "one yuan." We hereby declare that we are correcting this. It has been found that shipments of cotton yarn to the South have continued uninterrupted. Today (the 27th), 1,580 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 77 pieces will be shipped to Singapore. The source of the market rumors remains to be verified. However, sentiment has been shaken, and selling pressure has suddenly intensified, causing the market to turn from high to low. In fact, the closing price on the previous day was only 1,530 yuan, and it had now risen to 1,575 yuan, an increase of 45 yuan. Those who had profited generally had profits to take and sold out, causing a sudden reaction. If the underlying raw cotton issue could not be loosened, and the market price fell, buyers would definitely appear. In short, the yarn market is volatile. Without manipulation, it is difficult to make a profit. Outsiders who follow the trend are played in the hands of others, which is pitiful. Yesterday's highest price for 10-count Shuangma was 1,575 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,543 yuan. The initial noon opening price was 1,546 or 7 yuan, and then as low as 1,545 yuan. Subsequently, the bid price trended higher, rising to 1,561 yuan. The final price was 1,552 or 3 yuan. Generally, the bulls wanted to break through the 1,600 yuan mark, but they had to pause for a while. As far as the general public's clothing is concerned, the price of yarn is so high that it hinders people's livelihoods, and actual sales have suffered.

Shuangma's morning opening continued the firm bullish sentiment from the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price was 1,575 yuan. As soon as this price opened, sellers came one after another, and the trend turned downward. At the same time, those taking profits unanimously offered positions between 1,563 and 4 yuan. After some fluctuation, rumors spread that the Cantonese gang had stopped trading, and sentiment became more volatile, falling further to 1,544 yuan. However, the long positions came to drag in again and rose again to 1,559 yuan. The closing price was 1,550 yuan. The total trading volume in half a day was 9,605 bales. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 55, totaling 9,500 bales. Total 9,605

Jin Shuangma futures market conditions, the morning opening was flat, slightly lower in the middle, and the afternoon opening was still flat, but the closing was strong. As a result, the July contract rose by 1.5 yuan, and the August contract fell by 5 yuan. It was found that the total turnover for the day was 8,700 bales. The high, low, and closing prices for one day are as follows:

July Open 1416 1412

Close 1415.5 1418

Daily High 1419.5 Low 1410.5

August Open 1424 1418

Close 1422 1424.5

Daily High 1426.5 Low 1415

### Cotton Trading Factories and Firms Active

The situation for spot cotton remains firm. Those holding goods have a strong desire to hold onto prices. Shenxin factories have bought in large quantities, and trading among firms is also active. Prices have risen by 4 or 5 yuan. It is still difficult to approach prices for coarse and fine cotton, so few offers are made.

Brazilian Cotton 424.0 Shenxin Second Factory 462 Bales Sent to Factory

Also 439.0 Firm 2 Bales Machine Delivery

Lancashire Cotton 36.0 Also 200 Bales Also

Also 37.0 Also 200 Bales Also

Fire Machine Straw Bale 33 Shenxin Second 10 9 2,500 Sent to Factory

Also 203 Firm 200 Stack Delivery

Also 02 Also 300 Also

Also 201 Also 500 Also

Also 200.5 Also 170 Also The New York cotton market rose initially due to purchases by industry peers, but then fell back due to profit-taking by long positions and good cotton harvest conditions. Yesterday's closing price was 5 to 10 pounds lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to sales by European exporters and profit-taking by long positions, and then fell slightly due to purchases by speculators and uneven rainfall. As a result, the closing price fell by about one-eighth.

In other news, the Shanghai foreign cotton trade is quiet but firm. Due to a lack of sellers in recent days, transactions have been scarce. However, because the situation for current yarn continues to be good and Shanghai's inventory is not large, sentiment is unanimously bullish. Yesterday, Shenxin bought 300 bales of top-grade Brazilian cotton at a price of nearly 460 yuan.

### Piece Goods Piece Goods Traders Intend to Look High

The market for factory-made cloth was stable yesterday, and traders intended not to look small. Continuing to sell goods due at the end of the month were seen, and there were those who absorbed goods at a cheap price of 2.5 corners less than the market price, so the trend for cloth prices was tight. For the whole day, white goods fluctuated only by 1 to 2.5 corners. As a result, fine cloth and twill remained flat, light-weight coarse cloth rose by 2.5 corners, and the price of a portion of bleached and dyed cloth increased by 2.5 to 5 corners. Demand for bleached and dyed gray cloth and wholesale shops in Mu Street was slightly strong. Intentions in the retail market were pale due to the rainy weather. In total, over 300 pieces were transacted. Traders from the Zhejiang East Dinghai gang bought 50 or 60 pieces of raw-colored foreign yarn coarse cloth, etc. Traders from the Cantonese, Hong Kong, and Nanyang gangs bought over 200 pieces of printed and unbleached cloths. Today, there are 2,575 pieces of piece goods being shipped to Rangoon, another 200 pieces being shipped to Singapore, and 98 pieces being shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth Weakened Then Rose, Market Sentiment Still Strong, Futures for the leading firm in the exchange opened down 3 or 4 corners, gradually rising back up. Towards the closing in the afternoon, they recovered, rising by 6.1 corners per piece, coupled with good actual sales, short accounts desperately covered their positions, causing current goods to also rise 5 cents. The evening closing price was 47.35 yuan. Color goods "Four Gentlemen," the low end price saw 1.58 yuan, but there were many who used their cheap advantage to buy them, closing price was 1.597.7 yuan, also up 2.5 cents.

### Sugar Market Sugar Slightly Loosens

Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market was stable, with occasional slight loosening. The association's benchmark price for spot goods of No. 24 coarse white sugar imported in June was 90.046 yuan, slightly lower, 90.5 yuan for invoicing at the end of this month, 90 yuan for imports in May, 87.4 to 87.6 yuan for imports in April, 87 yuan for imports in March, which was softer. Dutch Red sugar NT mark 800 bags were sold at 68.7 yuan. Taikoo Company's present goods white B mark was at 105.6 to 105.6 yuan, transshipment goods were at 88.5 yuan, the lower grade saw a slight loosening. DY mark was at 93.8 to 94 yuan, HX mark was at 88.5 yuan in the West warehouse and 88 yuan in the East warehouse. On the 26th, 1,000 tons of sugar came from Java and 4,000 bags came from Hong Kong.

### North and South Goods Golden Vegetables from the Production Area Newly Arrived

According to reliable telegrams from Xuzhou, the first batch of newly purchased golden vegetables has sporadically appeared on the market, but there is still a lack of formal market prices. However, a telegram from a certain firm stated that the prices were higher, which may be exploratory in nature. It is said that this year's harvest is still abundant, and it seems inappropriate for the initial market price to be too high. We received a postal delivery with small samples of rice. The large rice is very pretty in terms of characteristics, color, and grains, the first market will definitely be very lively.

### My Thoughts on "Marital Change"

— Xu Daming

A Few Fair Words About Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua

In recent years, the word "change" seems to have struck it rich: from the "change" of things to the "change" of people; from the "change" of individuals to the change of the nation; truly nothing remains unchanged, and nothing is immune to change. In short—

"The times have changed, and we have no choice but to change along with them!"

However, the word "change" cuts both ways. Changing for the better is "change," and changing for the worse is also "change." While both are "change," there is a distinction between progress and decline.

As for the marital change of Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua, it clearly belongs to the category of "change." However, this "change" is not simply a personal issue between two individuals but rather a manifestation of a social phenomenon in a transitional era—it is a serious social problem today. As for the general public's extraordinary attention to Zhou Xuan because she is a "movie star," that is quite unnecessary. Such stories are hidden in every corner of today's society, with a significant number no doubt. However, because there is no "movie star" to easily stir up excitement, they are overlooked by people.

In most marital changes today, the conflict between "new" and "old" cannot be avoided. Some people have been washed by the tide of the times and move forward, while others not only stagnate but also cling to the remnants of feudal society, even wanting to "promote" them. This creates two torrents of progress and regression, and the phenomena reflected in society are the clash of these two torrents. Therefore, the daily occurrence of "divorce," "separation," and other events is not surprising or regrettable. It is simply a phenomenon that is bound to be reflected as society progresses to this era.

However, the "marital change" of Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua differs somewhat from the above principle. This is because it is a mutual slaughter between two feudal forces, and the one being ravaged is undoubtedly the weak woman within feudal society. (Because in a male-dominated society, women are inherently burdened with two layers of shackles.) Therefore, here I agree with a short article in this newspaper's "Entertainment" section the day before yesterday—Zhou Xuan should embrace the light and strive for the development of her film career. This is the correct path. As for the conclusion of this event, we hope that Zhou Xuan's own will be firm. However, in order to avoid "rumors" from the outside world, she should quickly leave the place of conflict. Devoting all her efforts to film art is the only way out for an artist. However, it must be noted that art is not a simple thing; it also has nationality and ethnicity. Finally, we still believe that this event is commonplace, a product of social development. However, it should be a lesson for Zhou Xuan—her own lack of resolve has created opportunities for others to attack. In the future, she should work harder in this regard and pay more attention to self-cultivation. This is the correct solution to this event and the path she should take.

### How to Deal With "People on the Water"

— Xinghua

"Accountant, please pay my tuition." The young master walked into the accounting room and said to me.

"The summer vacation has just started, how come you need to pay tuition already, and it's so expensive. The end of the month is near, and people are coming to settle accounts. The rent won't be collected until the third or fourth of next month! It's best to pay you when school starts." I knew he had no money and wanted to find a reason to get it.

"Accountant, my father also agreed to this. Your father isn't him. You..."

I thought about it and said, "That's right! This money isn't mine anyway, and besides, the master has already agreed. I might as well do a good deed and hand him a pile of banknotes."

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Ten: A慈父的心慈父的心 Father's Heart

"Third Master, it's raining so hard. Why don't I go pick up the young lady?" Zhang Xiaogouzi put down the dry tobacco pipe in his hand, stood up from a bamboo stool, and looked clearly at the middle-aged man standing under the eaves outside.

Middle-aged man? That's right! The current Begonia is already a completely middle-aged man!

"Time makes people old." This sentence was not just used to scare people. Five or six years is only a small change in numbers, but it has an incredible effect on everyone's appearance. The child who was only held in his mother's arms has already become a lively and clever elementary school student after five or six years; the woman who was once a beautiful young lady has become an aging woman after five or six years. Think about it! Five or six years, less than a hundred months in total, but can you underestimate it? No! No! Just look in the mirror, and you will believe it! Moreover, these few years have been spent in pain and suffering?

Close your eyes and think about it. The days when he was active on the red stage seem very close, almost like yesterday! But all of his handsome appearance, moving frowns and smiles, lively and excited spirit, and that extremely clever mind are completely gone now. The smooth skin has turned purple-brown; a few inches of beard have grown under his jaw and on his lips; horizontal and vertical wrinkles are densely covering his face. Although the two knife scars are not very obvious, if he is willing to stand in front of the mirror and look at himself, he will no longer recognize himself.

He stood under the eaves, which were so low that they almost touched his head, widening his eyes and raising half of his head, staring at the rain pouring down from the sky.

"The sky has also changed this year, with so much rain!" He said as if talking to himself, but his voice was no longer as clear as before.

Zhang Xiaogouzi had already stepped out of the door, holding an umbrella in his hand. (一四三)

Brief Comments
— Gu Minda

Dancer: "Why do you always bring a few books to the dance hall?"

Dance hostess: "That way people will think I'm a student."

Landlord: "This three-story attic will cost fifty yuan to rent."

Old woman: "I'm very poor, so let me have it cheaper!"

Landlord: "No, no."

Young girl: "How much does this three-story attic cost to rent?"

Landlord: "Fifteen yuan, I can even make it cheaper for you."

Woman: "Why are you following me?"

Youth: "I am a progressive youth."

Woman: "Where is your home?"

Man: "It's in the tall building in front."

Woman: "That's a prison!"

Man: "………………"

"And also, two hundred for meals, one hundred for books."

Haha—meal expenses, what a joke. He wouldn't want to eat the food at school even if he were dying. Isn't he just taking the money under a false pretense to go dancing? Books don't cost that much either. One hundred for one book. However, the money isn't mine anyway, and besides... Okay, I'll just take out another pile.

"It would be best to advance some travel expenses as well."

"Travel expenses! The master has a car for you to ride in."

"That's too inconvenient."

Okay, okay! I'll give him another fifty.

"It's okay for you to take the money, but you have to say a few good words for me in front of the master."

"Of course, we all understand."

He smiled, and I smiled too.

### Startled Dream

— Xu Pingzuo

### About Serving Herbal Tea

— Chen Yaozu

Under the blazing sun and scorching heat, people are sweating like漿, constantly calling out for heat, especially the working class, who are constantly running around all day, sweating profusely, unbearably hot, and their mouths are extremely dry. What a difficult thing this is!

But after all, there are still kind-hearted people in society. When this hot summer season arrives, they will set up a tea缸 at the entrance of the alley or on the side of the road, brew a缸 of boiled water, and provide it for the general working class to enjoy.

People like yellow-jacket rickshaw drivers, who run under the scorching sun, covered in sweat, and with very dry mouths, would surely die of thirst if they didn't have something to moisten their lips. Therefore, serving herbal tea is indeed a good deed with immeasurable merit.

However, I would like to respectfully inform those who serve herbal tea that the problem of the tea缸 needs attention. Because vehicles are running on the road, and dust is flying, if the tea缸 doesn't have a lid on it, it is inevitable that bacteria will enter it. Therefore, it is best to have a lid for each tea缸, and it must be properly covered when not in use. At the same time, I hope that the general public who drink the tea will also pay attention to hygiene and cover it immediately after drinking it. It is important to maintain cleanliness.

### Small Statistics

— Zhang Qing

There are five million residents in Shanghai, of which two million play mahjong. If there is one mahjong set for every five people, there are a total of 400,000 mahjong sets. Each mahjong set has 144 tiles, so there are a total of 57,600,000 tiles. That would be enough to stretch from Shanghai all the way to Chongqing, if they were arranged in a straight line.

### Want to Say, Want to Do

— Yaoyao

Think with your brain,

Speak with your mouth,

Do with your hands,

Don't think, don't speak,

Having spoken, you must do,

If you don't do, why think?

Having thought, you have thought,

Having spoken, you have spoken,

Having done, have you done?

Speak slowly,

Think carefully,

Do earnestly.

### Flesh Tumor

— Zuo Hui

After the war, my third uncle suddenly became rich, so the flesh tumor on his neck, which he didn't care about before, now made him greatly resentful. The reason is this: before the war, he had no money, so he was not willing to sell his appearance. Now that he drinks cloud ear fungus and ginseng tea, and eats shark fin, his face is nourished and glowing, but that flesh tumor shaking on his neck is really not a good thing, as if it's about to ruin his appearance.

My third uncle once talked to me about it, and I replied, "Then why don't you have it cut off!" But my third uncle said, "The tumor is too big, so it's difficult." "Then why didn't you have it cut off when it was smaller?" My third uncle stammered and didn't give a reason, so I also became silent. In my silence, my thoughts grew wings and flew far, far away.

I think my third uncle himself is a flesh tumor, but I'm too embarrassed to say it directly. Isn't that right? My third uncle sucks people's blood into his mouth and spits it into the warehouse, so people suffer from anemia and their faces are pale. But this social flesh tumor is gradually swelling and filling up... The tumor doesn't seem to look like anything, but it stores a lot of fat and blood meaninglessly, which is a great sin!

My third uncle resents the flesh tumor on his neck, but I resent the social flesh tumors even more. I use a resolute tone to say, "That flesh tumor, cut it off—only by cutting it off!"

### Talking About Kunling Bearded Actors

— Junmei

These days, both the Carlton and the Tianchan theaters are using Kunling bearded actors as their mainstays. Thus, Xu Dongming and Song Baoluo have become a pair competing for the stage. However, the two actors have different styles. Dongming sings Tan-style operas, purely in the Beijing court style, while Baoluo performs Yu-style operas, with a mixture of foreign Jiang style. In terms of skill, it is certainly not possible to make a definitive conclusion. But in terms of style, Xu may be superior to Song.

Kunling acting as a bearded actor, due to the relationship between vocal cords and sound, always lacks the air of old age. Therefore, since Kunling became popular, for three or four decades, Kunling bearded actors who can be outstanding are really few and far between. En Xiaofeng takes Zhu-style opera as his selling point. His high-pitched and resonant voice has the reputation of being the "little called heaven" of the Kun class and can be regarded as the chief priest in this field. There is also Xiao Lanyang, who sings "Teaching the Son," "Vermilion Mole," "Four Scholars," etc., which are also extremely pure and are rare among Kunling bearded actors. Lu Lanchun was also once extremely popular. In addition to Huang-style martial arts opera, he occasionally performed Tan-style bearded opera, and he was also able to grasp the essence and be meticulous. As for others such as Zhou Guibao, Chen Huifeng, Zhou Chu, and Chen Changgeng, although they occasionally have merits, they are like flashes in the pan and cannot be compared with the above-mentioned people. In the past, I once saw a Chen Baofeng in a jianghu troupe. He was unknown, but he could perform a lot of dramas. He performed tiring operas such as the entire "Four Lang Visits His Mother," from beginning to end, alone, without showing any signs of exhaustion. I secretly thought that if he were placed in a large city, with famous officials and dignitaries to promote him, and poets and writers to praise him, he would always be a promising talent. Unfortunately, his makeup was not elegant, and his actions were too contrived, so he remained unknown. The difficulty of finding Kunling bearded actors can be seen from this.

In recent years, Meng Xiaodong has been the foremost Kunling bearded actor. After studying with Shu Yan, his artistry has improved. However, he does not often perform. There are still Ma Yunjiao and Yang Bosheng in the old capital. Ma studied with Bao Jixiang, and Yang followed Liu Bo, and both have reputations. As for Zhang Wenjuan and Qiu Ledi, who went north from Shanghai, it is difficult to say what their future achievements will be. A certain famous Dan once said, "In the future, there will be no male actors playing Jinghuang roles." Regarding the difficulty of cultivating Kunling bearded actors, I would like to slightly change his meaning and say that it is because it violates natural law. Doing it occasionally may shock the world or gain temporary fame.

### Notes After Watching "Yue Fei"

— Ge Liang

At the same time and in the same place, thirty theaters were performing plays, whether they were movies or Peking operas, but none could match the spoken drama—Yue Fei.

The script of Yue Fei borrows from ancient people to satirize modern people. It has blood and tears, and few who watch it are not moved. The play is divided into five acts: the first act depicts Yue Fei making plans for the Northern Expedition. When the generals are happily taking orders, an edict ordering the immediate return of troops is suddenly delivered, like a thunderbolt from a clear sky. Then, twelve gold plaques are issued in succession, causing the loyal and patriotic Yue Fei to shed tears and return to the court.

The second act depicts crowds of people begging and blocking the troops that protected them—the Yue Family Army—from leaving them. But this was an order, and Yue Fei painfully bid farewell to these simple people, leaving Zhang Bao to thank the people for their concern.

In the third act, Zhao Shibao leads Yue Fei's daughter, Yinping Niang, to see Qin Hui, but the meeting ends unhappily. Hui secretly colludes with Hami Chi and Wang Shi to plot to harm loyal ministers in the East Window. Xing'er, a female servant in the prime minister's mansion, goes alone to assassinate Qin Hui, but fails.

In the fourth act, Dalu Temple Zheng Zhou Sanwei resigns because he is unwilling to frame loyal ministers. Wanqiu Yuan Gui Nian caters to the prime minister's favor and interrogates Xing'er and Yue Fei. Yue Fei is unwilling to submit despite severe torture, and the charge against Yue Fei is ultimately determined to be "perhaps."

In the fifth act, Yinping, disguised as Zhang Bao's son, goes to the prison to visit Yue Fei. Under the irretrievable situation, Zhang Bao commits suicide by crashing into the prison pillar. Yue Yun and Zhang Xian follow Yue Fei bravely to the Fengbo Pavilion to be executed. Yinping holds the will given to her by her father and sees four large characters: "Restore My Rivers and Mountains"!

The playwright, Jiang Shangqing, is successful. He makes the hot blood boil in the chests of many people, and their eyes contain tears of sympathy. The director, Shushi, has done his best. The scene in the fourth act where Yue Fei is tortured is depicted using shadows cast on the wall, which can be said to be an innovative setting.

As for the actors: Huang He's Yue Fei has the demeanor of a great general, Zhou Qi's Niu Gao is very lovable, Yu Yi's Zhang Bao is wholeheartedly loyal, and his performance is more than adequate. Chen Qi's Yinping is quite moving, and Huang Yu's Zhou Wei vividly portrays an upright official who is unwilling to frame loyal ministers. In the villain roles, Qiu Quan's Qin Hui is cunning and treacherous, and Chen Lu's Wang Shi is extremely wicked. All are quite successful. At this time and in this place, performing this play deserves our utmost respect.

Zhou Yuji imprisoned Wang Yongtai and died at the hands of bandits. He also wanted to take revenge in his heart. He said to Xu Jing, "The bandits are challenging us to fight. I will go out with you to kill them for a while. If we can kill one of their generals, we can slightly intimidate the bandits." Xu Jing said, "This general is willing to follow you to kill the bandits." So Zhou Yuji and Xu Jing led five hundred cavalrymen out of the city to fight. He also ordered Zhang Lie to lead five hundred archers to support them from behind. In Daizhou City, the drums immediately sounded loudly, the city gates opened, and the drawbridge was lowered. Zhou Yuji and Xu Jing rode out on horseback. A large flag fluttered in the wind, embroidered with the character "Zhou." The bandit general One-Eyed Tiger saw the flag and knew that the commander-in-chief had personally taken the field. He immediately waved his broadsword and stepped forward to meet the challenge. Zhou Yuji recognized him as a brave general under the bandit leader and wished he could stab him through with one spear. He used his 开金枪 to fight fiercely with One-Eyed Tiger in front of the battle. Xu Jing also fought with a bandit general. Li Zicheng saw this from behind and ordered his subordinates to capture Zhou Yuji alive, so he sent four more bandit generals to the battle, preparing to tire Zhou Yuji with轮战. One-Eyed Tiger was naturally strong and fought fiercely with Zhou Yuji for more than two hundred rounds. Suddenly, his horse lost its footing and threw him off. Zhou Yuji was overjoyed and was about to use his spear to kill him when another bandit general quickly rushed up and used the broadsword in his hand to block Zhou Yuji's golden spear. Thus, the bandits rescued One-Eyed Tiger. Zhou Yuji was very angry and used his spear urgently. Finding a gap, he stabbed with his spear, hitting the bandit general's chest, who fell off his horse backward, with fresh blood spurting out, and his heart was pierced. Xu Jing also stabbed the bandit general to death. The two men joined forces and charged together, two horses, two spears, straight into the bandit formation, wanting to capture Li Chuang. One-Eyed Tiger had already changed to a black horse and killed his way back. Xu Jing stopped him to fight fiercely. Zhou Yuji fought with another general and killed two generals. The bandit generals were greatly frightened. Zhou Yuji then charged into the formation on his horse to look for Li Zicheng. Li Muchen panicked and retreated, ordering his subordinates to release a volley of arrows to shoot Zhou Yuji. Seeing the rain of arrows gathering, Zhou Yuji knocked down dozens of arrows with his spear. Alone, he feared that he would be lost, so he turned his horse around. Seeing that Xu Jing was unable to defeat One-Eyed Tiger, he came to help. One-Eyed Tiger was not afraid of the two men at all. (一〇〇)

### A Discussion on the Ice Rink Scene in Shanghai (Part 2)

— Yuan Shen

Because of this, "Wing On" has made a great determination to improve the standard of skating. They renovated New Inn, replaced the cement practice rink with oil wood flooring, and replaced all the lights in the rink with sunlight lamps. Originally, the ticket office was very sloppy, but now it has become serious, and absolutely no irrelevant people are allowed to run around. Furthermore, after the autumn coolness, the authorities plan to completely replace the skates with new ones, and at the same time increase the ticket prices.

We can also report to the readers of the "Entertainment World" that nearly two skating groups have been established recently. One is the Skating Federation and the other is the Women's Skating Research Association. Both of these groups have invited the veterans of the ice rink, Shen Weide and Miao Huaiqiu, to serve as consultants.

The Skating Federation has a lot of important work to do. It is the highest organization in the Shanghai skating world. The current organizers are seeking assistance from social celebrities such as Zhang Shankun and Liu Zhonghao. The skating teams that have already been established include "Wing On," "Jie Bei," "Post Office Workers," and "Yue Guang," etc., with twelve people per team. In the future, they also plan to advance into the film and drama industry, organizing a "Drama People" team or a "Movie Star" team, hoping that the drama people and movie stars of Shanghai will voluntarily participate and promote it.

The work of the Women's Skating Research Association is to promote skating in every girls' middle school. After the teams are established in the future, they plan to invite Wang Liping, the champion of the "United Shanghai Women's Skating," and Yun Cuizhu, the runner-up, to serve as instructors. The Guangxia Middle School grounds may be borrowed for practice.

Skating is a sport and also an entertainment. It is very beneficial to the health and physical development of a person.
