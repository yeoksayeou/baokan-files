### Foreign Minister Guo Warns Democratic Nations to Be on High Alert Against Japan

Believes Japan's Expansionist Policy Will Never Stop; Condemns Germany's Brutal Actions

Chongqing, 27th—Foreign Minister Guo stated at a press conference on the 27th, regarding the Tojo Cabinet in Japan, that "the aggressive nature of the Tojo Cabinet is even stronger than before. This point has been noted by the anti-aggression group of nations and newspapers. However, since Tojo's cabinet took office, its movements have given some people a false sense of security. Therefore, I would like to re-emphasize the basic policy of the Japanese cabinet. What is this policy? It is external aggression and alliance with the Axis powers. I believe the Japanese government will take further aggressive actions. The reason is simple: Japan cannot remain still, nor can it retreat. Therefore, we should be on high alert. China has never relaxed its vigilance. As for where and against whom Japan will launch aggression in the future, the Philippine Dutch East Indies Singapore Thailand Burmese border or Siberia, it is all irrelevant. However, no matter where, no matter what form its aggression takes, I believe that all Pacific nations must deal with it in various more effective ways. This is true not only for countries whose interests and territories will be directly invaded. To this day, any future offensive by Japan should not be regarded merely as an attack on any country directly threatened, but as an attack on all anti-aggression nations. The German tactic of defeating countries one by one in Europe should not be allowed to be repeated by Japan in East Asia. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox said that if Japan continues its current policy, a conflict between the U.S. and Japan will be inevitable. I believe this applies to all other nations whose interests are being threatened by Japan. Regarding the German massacre of French hostages, Foreign Minister Guo stated that China deeply sympathizes with the condemnations of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. Such brutal actions are simply intolerable to the Chinese people. I would like to add that Germany's friends in the Far East are even more excessive in their attitude towards such massacres."

A reporter also asked if the Soviet Union had stopped providing aid to China. Guo replied that Soviet aid had never been continuous due to transportation and other difficulties.

Macau's Population Increases Sharply

Hong Kong—Neutral Macau is seen as a good place of refuge by destitute refugees from Guangdong Province and the war zones of North China, due to the widespread fires of war in Europe and China. Macau has no immigration restrictions. In view of the large number of refugees, the Macau government has allocated 600,000 Macau patacas (equivalent to 333,333 Chinese dollars) annually for relief. At the same time, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Jinghe Hospital, and other charitable organizations are carrying out relief work. Macau's population has soared to 500,000 since 1938 due to the influx of refugees. According to official estimates, 250,000 of the 300,000 refugees are destitute. Recently, the number has increased again due to Hong Kong's restrictions on immigration. A small number of refugees, from Guangzhou and Foshan, are from well-off families. They moved here in 1938 because they saw that the cost of living in Macau was lower than in Hong Kong. Governor Teixeira has secured work for 5,000 refugees, ordering them to develop Macau's outer harbor and fill in swamps for post-war operations or residential areas. Although Macau's annual tax revenue has decreased from 7 million to 6 million due to the impact of the freeze order, the general public is still very optimistic about the future because Macau's port facilities are new and its terrain is excellent.

### German Forces in the South Launch a Full-Scale Attack; Fierce Battle in the Donets Basin; Soviet Communiqué Admits the Fall of Stalino; Soldiers in the Central Region Ordered to Defend Moscow to the Death

Havas, Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 26th—On the 127th day of the German-Soviet war, the battle situation in all directions is roughly as follows: (1) German forces are attempting to break through the Soviet defense line in the Crimea region, encountering various difficulties; (2) The battle near Rostov-on-Don, the "Gateway to the Caucasus," is very fierce, and the Red Army is under considerable threat; (3) Moscow is still firmly defended by the Red Army, but German aircraft are bombing fiercely.

Reuters, London, 20th—Moscow Radio stated that the battle to defend Rostov-on-Don is quite fierce. Although Fascist forces have launched desperate attacks in the past few days, they have failed to advance. In a certain area on the western front, German forces attempted to cut off the main road leading to the city of "V." The Soviet forces defending the area fought fiercely from the morning of October 23rd to the night of October 24th, repelling repeated attacks by the German forces. The enemy suffered more than a thousand casualties and still failed to achieve its goal. In the Maloyaroslavets region, the German attempt to break through the Soviet defense line along the highway also failed.

Reuters, London, 27th—The German side claimed to have captured Stalino, a key industrial center in the Donets Basin, several days ago, but the Soviet side only announced in its communiqué last night that Soviet forces had withdrawn from the city after many days of fierce fighting. In this battle, the German forces suffered 50,000 casualties and lost 250 tanks, more than 170 artillery pieces, and 1,200 trucks loaded with military equipment. The battle for the Donets River is continuing fiercely. Yesterday's German communiqué stated that German forces were "continuing to advance," but the latest Soviet communiqué stated that German offensives were repelled and suffered heavy losses. The center of the fighting is in Kharkov, upstream of the Donets River, and Taganrog, at the southern end of the 250-mile-long front line. Although reliable sources in London did not confirm the news that German forces had occupied Kharkov yesterday, it is clear that German General von Kleist is driving his troops to launch a pincer-like desperate attack on the Donets Basin, regardless of the huge sacrifice of life and military equipment. The German forces attacking in the northern route appear to be passing through Kharkov, and then may advance southeast along the Donets River. The German forces on the southern route are advancing south of Taganrog along the Sea of Azov towards the key port of Rostov-on-Don. German forces claimed that German aircraft had launched preparatory fierce attacks on the "Soviet retreat line" in the Kharkov and Zaporozhye regions, destroying nine Soviet troop trains and damaging twenty-six. The German advance in the Donets River basin has not slightly diminished the offensives elsewhere. The Soviet midnight communiqué stated that fierce fighting continued all day yesterday in Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets. According to newspaper reports received from London late last night, German forces have strengthened their pressure here. Unconfirmed reports said that Soviet forces had retreated 20 miles from Maloyaroslavets and were defending a new line of defense outside the Soviet capital. A Reuters correspondent reported from Chekhov that German forces continued their fierce attacks in the Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets regions starting on Friday, in order to find the best starting point for resuming the offensive. In the southern part of this region, Soviet forces were forced to retreat to new positions in some locations. The full text of the Soviet midnight communiqué is as follows: "On October 26th, our forces engaged the enemy in the directions of Mozhaisk, Maloyaroslavets, Kharkov, and Taganrog. In various regions of the western front, German forces launched continuous fierce attacks on our defensive lines, all of which were repelled. The enemy suffered heavy losses. After many days of fighting, our forces have withdrawn from Stalino. The enemy suffered heavy losses in this battle. On October 25th, 27 German aircraft were destroyed, and 17 Soviet aircraft were lost."

United Press International, London, 27th—Moscow Radio announced this morning that, due to increased Soviet resistance, Hitler has increased the number of troops and all tanks by hundreds of thousands, preparing for an even greater and more dramatic war. Fighting is currently taking place along the Nara River, 40 miles southwest of Moscow. Soldiers on the central front have received new military orders not to retreat a single step, stating that at this stage it is particularly necessary to contain the Fascists and defend Moscow with the last drop of blood. Anyone who does not fulfill their duties will be regarded as a traitor and executed."

The War Enters its 18th Week; German Casualties Exceed Three Million

Reinforcements will soon be unable to be deployed. It also said that "nearly all of the German army, nine-tenths of the German air force, and all mechanized divisions are fighting on the eastern front." The newspaper acknowledged that German forces are still extremely fearsome, but said that it is very possible that the Red Army will increase its strength, while German forces cannot.

TASS, Moscow, 27th—On the 25th, a certain unit of our army in the central region repelled three fierce enemy offensives. As a result, 32 enemy tanks, 11 artillery pieces, and other military equipment were destroyed, and 1,800 enemy soldiers were annihilated. Another unit of the Red Army also destroyed 37 enemy tanks, 270 trucks, and annihilated an enemy regiment.

### British Labor Holds a Demonstration Rally; Calls for an Offensive on the Western Front

The Internationale and The Red Flag Echo Through the Clouds; Resolution Urges the Government to Fulfill its Promise to Aid the Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 27th—Ten thousand workers held a demonstration rally yesterday in Trafalgar Square, demanding "full support for the Soviet Union." It started with roars and noise, and eventually turned into cheers for the Soviet Union, and the singing of "The Red Flag." Miss Wilkinson, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Home Security, addressed the crowd, but even though her voice was amplified by a loudspeaker, it was drowned out by the crowd's loud calls for "an offensive on the western front." When the calls subsided slightly, Miss Wilkinson said, "The key to supporting the Soviet Union is to provide it with supplies, and this key is in the hands of the workers." Upon hearing this, a portion of the crowd shouted, "Help them go." After Miss Wilkinson finished speaking, 20 representatives from various branches of the London Labour Movement gave speeches from the two platforms below Nelson, but only a few people listened to them. Member of Parliament Summerskill called on workers to launch an offensive against waste and inefficiency in their families and workplaces. Fletcher, Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, said that he believed the Soviet Union would eventually win. The conference then passed a resolution guaranteeing the Soviet Union that the British people are determined to provide the Soviet Union with the greatest possible practical assistance as soon as possible. The resolution also stated, "The conference guarantees to strongly urge the government to fully implement its promises in this matter, and instructs factories to work hard so that the necessary materials can be produced quickly and in large quantities." The conference also passed a resolution calling for the lifting of the ban on the communist newspaper, "The Daily Worker." The crowd dispersed while cheering "Long Live the Soviet Union" and singing "The Internationale" and "The Red Flag." This demonstration rally was organized by the London Trades Council, the London Labour Party, and the Royal Arsenal Cooperative Society, and was sponsored by the Communist Party of London.

Editorial

### International Exchange Rates and Price Controls

Since the United States froze Chinese and Japanese funds and the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee announced on August 18 a new exchange rate for the legal tender of 5 and 5/16 US cents per yuan (i.e., 18.82 yuan per US dollar) and restricted the supply of this US exchange rate in the Shanghai market, the exchange rate of the legal tender and prices have changed rapidly. There is a sense of "a storm is brewing". Therefore, the general public has doubts about this control measure, and there is no shortage of friendly foreigners who continue to criticize it. The most powerful reason against exchange rate controls is that both the Shanghai exchange rate and prices have their own special factors that cannot be controlled. Next, it is said that the newly set exchange rate of the legal tender is too high and must be reduced to around 4 US cents (or 27 yuan of legal tender per US dollar) to match the rising price level in order to maintain it. This implicitly acknowledges the relationship between exchange rates and prices. Furthermore, it is said that today's shrinking black market and rising prices indicate that exchange rate controls are not perfect. In short, there are many Chinese and Western people who hope that this city will become a special international market and preserve a free-market trading system. Considering this free market, how will it continue to be maintained? Is it our special order that the legal tender bear this heavy burden, or should friendly foreign funds share the difficult task? There is no definite answer, as if the responsibility lies solely with the legal tender. But what is puzzling is why this free market still needs to be maintained during wartime? Can the recent rapid changes in the black market and prices be attributed to the Exchange Stabilization Fund's exchange rate controls?

In essence, what kind of impact does this control measure have on the city's economic institutions, and how does it affect general livelihood issues? There is factual evidence, so it is not difficult to follow the clues. All countries have precedents for not maintaining free markets during wartime, and what is not maintained only refers to speculative transactions that cannot supply legal tender to anyone. This is the same as cracking down on financial disturbances in peacetime. Moreover, friendly foreigners know that our national treasury is short of funds. Forcing the endless legal tender to be consumed in the wasteful spending of huge amounts of mobile capital in this city will inevitably have a day of exhaustion. What good is it? And this is enough to show that mobile capital should quickly seek other profitable production avenues to avoid the worry of being left behind. Taking the supply of the black market in recent days as an example, it is indeed like the loopholes in the control that we pointed out earlier, but it must also have a day of exhaustion and have to plan for it early. As for the recent surge in prices and the sharp contraction of black market exchange rates, they are purely special performances of free trading in this city. If there were no exchange rate control measures, the surge and contraction would undoubtedly be doubled. Taking rice as an example, if there were no new regulations on the exchange rate of legal tender, the Public Works Department would have long changed its selling price. Although other influences are small, they are not impossible to trace.

We firmly believe that the Exchange Stabilization Fund can complete its predetermined mission and that this measure is beneficial and without harm. Some say that certain imported goods that have been converted into foreign exchange have not yet seen their prices reduced to lighten the burden on consumers, and point this out as a flaw. However, this responsibility belongs to the municipal authorities, not the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which cannot implement it. It is rumored that the authorities in the concessions have repeatedly held meetings to crack down on brokers and general middlemen. If this is true, prices will definitely change afterwards. It is also heard that the authorities in the concessions are actively planning to monopolize essential consumer goods. It is sincerely hoped that it will be realized soon, so as to cooperate with the Exchange Stabilization Fund and achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. Exchange rate controls and price controls must be implemented simultaneously in order to support each other and achieve success. Some foreign economic scholars say that the exchange rate of the legal tender is entirely subject to the price level and cannot be forcibly regulated, which is far from the mark and does not need to be elaborated on. This theory has not been applied in European and American countries, and all countries are engaged in controlling exchange rates and prices. This is what we hope that the gentlemen of the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the authorities in the concessions will do their best to break the deadlock and establish a new banner of good governance in the international market, leading the way in international cooperation.

### Establishment of Guerrilla Base Areas in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Triangle

Guerrilla Forces Strengthen, All Able to Operate Independently, People in the Area Have a Strong Understanding of the Country and Move Backwards One After Another

A Certain Place in Western Zhejiang - Several counties in western Zhejiang have become guerrilla areas. Over the years, guerrilla units have been active in the area and have been constantly fighting with the Japanese army. It can be said that in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou triangle, they are the center of activity and have established deeply rooted guerrilla base areas. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the Beijing-Shanghai National Highway are constantly being damaged, and Japanese transportation is often interrupted. In the counties occupied by the Japanese army in the guerrilla area, people's lives are difficult, while lives in the free area are stable and life is guaranteed. Therefore, the general public has moved back to the countryside from the cities one after another. This phenomenon of people's hearts turning inward is worth paying attention to. The quality and quantity of self-defense units in the guerrilla area have been strengthened compared to the past. They have shifted from a defensive posture to an offensive one. In addition to assisting regular troops in attacks, they can also independently initiate combat operations. For example, the German-French self-defense force attacked Xinshi, and the HaiNing self-defense force captured Huangwan Baobao, all of which have recorded achievements. In the past, in guerrilla counties, county magistrates often avoided leaving the county when they encountered Japanese sweeps, but recently they have also been able to fulfill their responsibility of defending their territory, and no one dares to leave the county without authorization. In addition, the people in the guerrilla area have suffered oppression and trampling, which has strengthened their understanding of the country. Recently, the Western Zhejiang "One Yuan for Plane" campaign raised a total of 450,000 yuan, and the people in the Japanese-occupied areas donated more than 200,000 yuan. This is enough to show the general atmosphere of popular indignation. (27th Dispatch)

### The Eleventh Annual Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers Held in Lanzhou Is of Great Significance

Lanzhou Is the Center of the Country and Has Abundant Resources, Scientists Should Be Encouraged to Go There to Develop Resources

Guiyang - The meeting location for the Eleventh Annual Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers has been decided to be held in Lanzhou. According to the person in charge of the association, the significance of holding the annual meeting in Lanzhou is that Lanzhou is the center of the country, and the railway trunk line of the Premier's industrial plan also takes the area as the center. Moreover, Lanzhou has abundant coal and iron, ample oil reserves, and a good natural environment for forests and animal husbandry, but it has not been developed. Engineers and scientists across the country should be encouraged to go there to develop resources in the future.

Random Talks on the European War

### The French People's Gloom

The problem for France is not whether she should "cooperate" with Germany and join the new European order to obtain better survival opportunities, or whether she should continue to secretly contact her former allies and cultivate the friendship of the United States in the hope that Britain and the United States will eventually defeat Germany. The question is whether France is willing to remain a part of Western culture, or whether she is willing to bow her head and be enslaved by the German master.

I want to say that if the French can avoid it, they will not take the second route above. I also want to say that at the moment, it is really difficult for them to actively liberate themselves.

France has experienced the greatest failure in her history, suffered the deepest humiliation in her history, and her moral resistance has also declined. The Germans are taking advantage of this opportunity. Many loyal French people are wondering why Hitler's experiment to unify Europe should not be tried, and they also complain that the British should not prolong this futile struggle and delay peace. Even some Americans think so.

A large part of this thinking is, of course, due to German propaganda. Hitler must make France admit that everyone is to blame for causing the war, and everyone must be responsible for France's disaster, except for him. Hitler's propaganda has surprisingly succeeded. The number of French people who have fallen into his trap may astonish future historians. Although I understand that it is difficult to make anyone on this side of the Atlantic understand the decadence and chaos in France and other European countries, I cannot help but think that if the French leaders did not adopt a policy of cooperation with the Axis powers that was impossible or difficult to achieve, but only announced the facts and simply admitted "defeat," then France's position in the world might be stronger than it is now.

If France, through the mouths of her leaders, announced that she still has unshakable confidence in fighting twice in 25 years to protect freedom and justice, then how great would France's reputation be, even in today's dark times! If our current leaders could announce to the world the true thoughts of most of the French people, saying that they hope that the sacrifices of the French people will not be in vain, and that their courage in struggling under the iron heel of the conquerors may encourage those who continue to fight for justice, then how touching would the example we show be!

Of course, some will say that in view of the tragic failure of France, there was really no way to go except for the path taken by the Vichy government. Pétain cannot go any further except to make Germany respect the armistice terms as much as Pétain respects himself. The prestige that Pétain enjoys in France is not only proof of France's reunification, but also the best defense against further extortion by the conquerors.

### Value of Ten Taels of Gold Reaches 20,000 Yuan, Purchased by Tian Yuan

Yesterday, although the October futures of refined gold fell slightly by 300 yuan to 8,500 yuan, manipulated by one or two agents, the actual transaction volume was only 80 taels. Including book transfers, it was nearly 1,000 taels. Cash was still in turbulent waters, initially rising sharply, then rebounding. After breaking through the 20,000 yuan mark, it soared instantly, once reaching an unprecedented high of 20,100 yuan. In the morning, a certain bank's speculative leader came in strongly, and money changers fiercely competed to raise the price. This new peak emerged amidst the chaos. Soon, the Tianjin gang suddenly dumped their holdings, and the Hong Kong gang and cash houses, along with Xianghe, also sold fiercely, causing a rapid reversal. It plunged 1,300 yuan, falling to the day's low of 18,800 yuan. After 10 o'clock, the exchange suddenly announced a slight commission on market transactions, and the activity of general retail investors suddenly weakened. The price fluctuations also narrowed. In the afternoon, money changers re-entered, rising to 9,500 yuan, and finally squeezing up another 1,250 yuan. Transactions went from booming to sparse, with 4,400 to 4,500 taels changing hands. Jewelry gold also reached a historical high of 2,030 yuan, finally closing at 1,980 yuan, up another 130 yuan. Purchases decreased by 150 yuan, silver rose by 2 yuan, and the premium reached 18 yuan.

The price of refined gold cash initially rose and then fell back. After breaking through the 20,000 yuan mark, it quickly retreated. People's minds were fluctuating uncertainly. The morning opening price was 19,500 yuan, driven by consistent buying from Hethai, Tianyuan, money changers, and retail investors, opening 1,350 yuan higher. The buying momentum continued to increase, rising another 600 yuan, with Tianyuan pushing it to 20,100 yuan. Xianghe and the Tianjin gang, seeing the high price, rushed to sell, leading to a rebound and a drop of 1,300 yuan, falling back to 18,800 yuan. Xianghe re-entered, pushing it up to 9,300 yuan around 10 o'clock, then falling back again. Because the exchange suddenly announced that from that day onwards, a commission of 5 yuan, plus an income tax of 3 jiao, would be charged on single-sided cash transactions. The activity of retail investors weakened immediately, and the price fluctuations also narrowed. Defu, Xianghe, and the Tianjin gang continued to sell, and Decheng also sold, calling it down to within 9,000 yuan. The noon closing price was 19,050 yuan. In the afternoon, Xiangxing Yong first bought 40 taels from Xianghe, with the opening price at 19,230 yuan. Xianghe and others sold, shorting it by 130 yuan, falling back to 100 yuan. Shun Yuan entered strongly, rising sharply around 3:30, reaching 500 yuan. Finally, Yifeng and cash houses sold. The 4 o'clock closing price was 19,400 yuan, a sharp increase of 1,250 yuan compared to last Saturday's noon closing price. It has risen for nine consecutive days, with a total increase of over 9,670 yuan. The difference between the day's high and low was 1,300 yuan. The listed price of cash houses' own brand gold was 19,600 yuan, with the purchase price being 800 yuan to 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.

### Black Market Exchange Rates: Demand Exceeds Supply

—Foreign Currencies Rise Again, Only Japanese Yen Falls—

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The listed prices of HSBC and the Central Bank remained unchanged. The small counter prices of HSBC and others did not change. The black market rates for British and American currencies were two jiao for British pounds and three yuan for US dollars. Importers who were generally not allowed to apply were in urgent need of Japanese yen, but there were no sellers. The underlying situation was very tight, with demand exceeding supply throughout the day. The evening closing prices were the same as the above prices. Although the closing prices were the same as last Saturday's, there was a slight softening trend. Yesterday, foreign currencies rose because the black market US dollar was about to break the 3 yuan mark, and the cash price had once exceeded the 20,000 yuan mark, causing people's hearts to be even more uneasy and leading to relentless buying. British and American gold pounds rose another 20 yuan, British gold notes rose 4 yuan, US gold notes rose another 3 yuan, and Hong Kong notes rose by a dime. In addition, currencies such as Singapore, Annam, rupees, Canada, the Philippines, Italy, Australian gold notes, and Siamese notes also tended to rise. Only Japanese gold notes and Korean notes continued to decline. The former fell to 3 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, and the latter fell to 1 yuan and 6 jiao.

### Yarn Market Exhausted After Repeated Rises

The rising trend in the yarn market continued unabated, with an upward trend. Generally, speculators, seeing that gold only rose and did not fall, were unanimously bullish on commodity prices. Under this environment, the yarn market evolved into a situation of only rising and not falling. The morning opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 2,460 yuan, and buyers poured in. Soon, it rose to 2,490 yuan and was declared a limit up. However, off-market trading continued to advance, rising to 2,585 yuan and then falling back to 2,545 yuan. Because large traders sold thousands of bales according to the market price to maintain the market, the market situation was slightly calmer. In the afternoon, the price of gold rose again, with large trades reaching 2,589 yuan. It was found that 6,500 bales were traded in half a day. Shenxin No. 2 Factory opened 230 bales of 20-count Tiannv yarn at a price of 2,530 yuan.

Double Horse gold futures, with the actual factory orders rising again, were limit up. The November futures, which were interdependent, immediately traded up to 2,419 yuan and were raised to 2,500 yuan limit up. The remaining months also rose by 100 yuan across the board and were limit up. The guild was handling margin calls, which was completed at noon. The industry gathered to discuss continuing to suspend trading in the afternoon, but off-market trading continued, with the price of gold standing at 19,000 yuan and continuing to rise. Large traders were standing aside, and short sellers were forced to cover. The market situation was tilted towards the bullish side. It is estimated that the factory orders also rose to 2,630 to 2,640 yuan, with spot and futures prices rising in tandem. Last week, there was a sharp rise for six days, with a daily increase of 100 yuan. The bulls were insatiable, and this continued day after day, inviting trouble. It is not known where this will end. Those engaged in this business should be cautious. The total daily trading volume was 6,000 to 7,000 bales, which was a reduction from the previous 20,000+ bales.

### Large Quantities of Foreign Cotton Arrive in Shanghai, Over 35,000 Bales of American and Indian Cotton Arrive.  Mitterling Raised to 1,100 Yuan

American and Indian cotton arrived one after another. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 25th), carrying 3,905 bales of cotton from Hong Kong. It docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The cotton was transported from Karachi to Hong Kong and then transshipped. In addition, the Argentine merchant ship Norta (SSNCRTE), managed by the foreign department manager of the same company, transported a large quantity of cotton, 30,810 bales, from Santos, USA. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th of this month, but it was delayed along the way. According to the company, the ship was expected to arrive last night, and at the latest, it would be able to enter the port this morning and dock at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading. (Zu)

The spot cotton situation continued to advance, and the rising trend remained strong. The public's belief in cotton prices was strengthened by the soaring prices of premium gold and yarn, leading to increased trading and a sudden rise in prices by several tens of yuan.

Mitterling 100 bales 200.0 Gongda
Lancashire Cotton 200 bales 620.0 Tongyi
Pengjiapo 100 bales 800.0 Haojia
Huishideng 100 bales 730.0 Haojia
Lancashire Cotton 400 bales 600.0 Haojia
Lancashire Cotton 200 bales 595.0 Haojia
Lancashire Cotton 100 bales 590.0 Haojia
Lancashire Cotton 200 bales 589.0 Haojia
Lancashire Cotton 500 bales 580.0 Haojia
Lancashire Cotton 100 bales 586.0 Haojia
Dulila 100 bales 600.0 Haojia
Central India 100 bales 600.0 Haojia

The New York cotton market initially fell due to long liquidation and negative political news from Washington, but subsequently, it rose slightly due to some short covering and buying by the industry. As a result, the closing price fell by seventeen or eighteen points. The Indian cotton market initially rose due to industry trading and short covering, but later fell back due to speculative selling. As a result, the closing price rose by about four or five rupees each. It is also predicted that the opening price today will fall by two to four rupees.

### Rice Shipments Arrive, Rice Prices Soar

The rice market claimed that the Municipal Council's rice bureau did not allocate much rice as an excuse to raise rice prices step by step. However, the fact remained that Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship brought 8,922 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong last Saturday, docking at the French Concession's Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is rumored that a Dutch ship will arrive today with a large shipment of Javanese foreign rice, so there is no shortage of rice in Shanghai. (Zu)

Yesterday, foreign rice also soared with the price of gold, with an alarming rising trend. The green rice market had long been seeing wild trading under the control of innkeepers and speculators. It was claimed that the small sundry shops selling at fair prices had run out, and foreign firms had not issued much rice, as a pretext to raise prices, making the market even more tense. This was nothing more than rampant speculation, hoarding by speculators, and a ball game moving straight up. Number 1 Saigon rose from 174 yuan to 178 yuan. Silver warehouse small-grain rice rose from 155 yuan to 159 yuan. Large traders also used small-grain rice to push close to the 160 yuan mark, all watching and waiting, then falling back to 156 to 157 yuan. Until near the closing, due to renewed absorption by large off-market traders, prices rose again by one yuan or more. Therefore, the final price for silver warehouse small-grain rice was 158 yuan, for foreign warehouse rice, 157 yuan, and for Number 1 Saigon, 176 to 177 yuan. The total daily trading volume was no less than 35,000 to 36,000 bags. However, after the repeated rises in rice prices, orders were gradually transferred again. Yesterday, Meilong sold 1,000 tons of November small-grain rice at 175 yuan. Yinghua Company opened at 188 yuan in the market.

Over 400 shi of thick and thin, new and broken japonica rice arrived. The selling price was strong, varying by three to four yuan. South Port early broken rice was priced at 186 yuan to 184 yuan, Kunshan new japonica rice at 183 to 184 yuan, Qingjiao kiln rice and Fengjing rice at 182 to 183 yuan, and Sijing wild rice at 189 yuan. Glutinous rice has been scarce for a long time, with Hong Kong rice reaching as high as 196 yuan, ordinary rice at 193 to 194 yuan, and the lowest at 189 yuan. Glutinous green bean rice was priced at 183 yuan, up another six to seven yuan.

### Flour Market Extremely Tight and Rising

Yesterday, the foreign flour market was extremely tight and rising. The morning opening price for Pao Tai flour was 48 yuan plus half a yuan, and for Jin Long flour, it was 46 yuan to 46 yuan and 7 jiao, both rising by more than two and a half yuan compared to Saturday. Soon, there were profit-taking sales, and rumors that the fair-price goods would soon be rationed and sold at cost. Then, the Tianjin gang sold back, and Pao Tai flour fell slightly to 47 yuan and 8 jiao, and Jin Long flour to 45 yuan and 6 jiao and 8 jiao, but still up by about one and a half yuan. Bran also soared to 48 yuan. It was reported that people were reluctant to sell.

### Sugar Rising Trend Resumes

Yesterday, the rising trend in the sugar market resumed, with many fluctuations. The difference between the highest and lowest prices reached seven or eight yuan. The company's futures price for 24 grade coarse white sugar for October 30th opened at 247 yuan in the morning and closed at 47 yuan and 8 jiao in the afternoon. The highest price was the same, and the lowest was 45 yuan. The price for November 10th opened at 261 yuan, closed at 60 yuan and 8 jiao. The highest price was 64 yuan and a half, and the lowest was 58 yuan. The guild's spot price for 24 grade coarse white sugar for October imports was 252 yuan and a half to 62 yuan, for September, 253 yuan to 61 yuan, for August, 251 yuan to 60 yuan, and for July, 248 yuan to 56 yuan. Hong Kong goods were priced at 233 yuan to 22 yuan, and Dutch red sugar at 233 yuan to 24 yuan, rising by fifteen yuan, eight yuan, and four yuan respectively. A total of over 35,000 bags of futures and over 8,000 bags of spot goods were traded.

Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship arrived last Saturday, carrying 2,737 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, docking at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.

### Public Bonds Still Falling

The off-market trading of public bonds experienced another decline yesterday. People's confidence could not be boosted as the price of gold discovered to be over 20,000 yuan. Long positions in public bonds had no intention of entering the market, and short positions did not cover much, resulting in a sluggish market with light trading. In the morning, Class C bonds opened at only 67 yuan, which was an excessive pressure from the short positions. Therefore, it immediately triggered short covering, rising by eight or nine jiao. Other bonds did not experience such large fluctuations. Runde bought, Zhongfu sold Class E and bought Class C, Yuancheng Shuntai sold, and retail investors sold more than they bought. Class A bonds broke through the 5 yuan mark. In the afternoon, selling pressure intensified again. Lianhe and Lianyi bought, and Shengxing, Jiufeng, and Hongda sold. Class C bonds, after opening at 67 yuan and 8 jiao, gradually fell to the lowest closing price of seven yuan and one jiao. Class A bonds even broke through four yuan, falling the most drastically. Class B bonds also broke through nine yuan. As a result, all bonds fell by two jiao and a half to one yuan and six jiao. The trading volume was 1.2 million to 1.3 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

In stock trading, 100 shares of the Commercial Press Printing Company were traded, with each share priced at 231 yuan.

The stock market of the Public Industries Exchange was extremely active, with opening prices rising significantly. Although there was a slight rebound in the afternoon, the closing trend was quite firm. Xiangtai shares reached a high price of 122 yuan and a half and closed at 119 yuan and a half. Rubber shares had extremely large trading volumes, with prices moving in tandem with industrial shares.

The Shanghai Malay Rubber Tree Co., Ltd., managed by the British firm Huitong 洋行, is scheduled to distribute an interim dividend for 1941 on November 14, with each share receiving 2 yuan in national currency.

### Factory Opens Futures at High Price, Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply and Falls Slightly

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market continued to be firm due to the soaring price of gold, with no end in sight. Speculators began to snap up goods again, and cloth prices reached new highs. Later in the market, because the factory opened futures at high prices, many floating profits were taken, and there was a slight decline. Sixteen-pound Butterfly coarse cloth was heard in the morning at 99 yuan, jumping up six yuan from last Saturday, then rising to 101 yuan and 5 jiao. Later, because the factory opened the December futures price at 100 yuan, traders sold off, and the evening closing price fell back to 99 yuan, up six yuan. Dapeng fine cloth sold over 90 yuan at its peak, and the subsequent market also fell back to 88 yuan, up more than five yuan. Coarse and fine cloths, twills, etc., rose by three to five yuan each. The quoted prices for bleached and dyed cloths were chaotic, with a weaker upward trend. Over 500 pieces were traded in this street, with clear sales.

Eastern Cloth: The futures cloth in the trading exchange rose by 4 jiao and 9 fen, reaching the limit up, causing the spot market to rise even more frantically. The peak factory order price for Longtou fine cloth reached 92 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and the evening closing price fell slightly to 91 yuan and 9 jiao, but it was still a sharp increase of 6 yuan and 7 jiao per bolt compared to last Saturday's market. The peak new order price for Sijunzi Serge reached 3 yuan and 4 jiao, with a low price of 3 yuan, 2 jiao, 6 and 7 fen, but the closing price in the subsequent market was still high, with a trading price of 3 yuan and 3 jiao and 7 fen, and goods were very tight.

Colonel Howard's message stated, "Navy Day was first created by the Navy League of the United States in 1922, and it has been commemorated every year since. The reason why October 27 was chosen as Navy Day is because it is the birthday of the late President Theodore Roosevelt. The former president devoted his life to establishing a strong US naval policy. He first wrote a book on naval history in the War of 1812, which was famous throughout the country. He then served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy and President, always striving to impress upon the American people the need for a strong US Navy and, as a leader, working to realize this ideal."

Reaching an Unprecedentedly Powerful Stage

October is also the month in which the US Navy was established in 1775. Commemorating Navy Day has proven to make the American public better understand the US Navy and its work. This kind of understanding is quite necessary in a country where public opinion guides the government. On this Navy Day in 1941, the US Navy's strength and preparedness have reached an unprecedented level. At a time when the peace and security of all democracies are threatened, all American citizens can be satisfied to know that the Navy, the first line of defense of their country, is ready to fulfill its mission.

British-American Cooperation to Defend the Far East

The US Asiatic Fleet is the main military force of democracies in the Far East. It is reported to have suddenly arrived at the British naval base in Singapore, proving the close cooperation between Britain and the United States in defending the East. The Asiatic Fleet is permanently stationed in this hemisphere. Its ships are rarely transferred, and only the flagship changes more frequently. Currently, the fleet's flagship is the Houston, replacing the previous ship, the Augusta. The Houston is a 10,000-ton cruiser, the largest of the US ships currently in the Far East. The Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet has his headquarters on this ship, directing the actions of the ships in the valley.

Asiatic Fleet Possesses Abundant Strength

The Asiatic Fleet has ten destroyers, three escort ships, and the Black Hawk care ship, six submarines, and the Canopus submarine care ship. In addition, there are many auxiliary small ships, such as mine-laying ships and aviation care ships, all of which are small tug-type ships that assist the ships during operations or in emergencies, such as when the transport ship Chamonix ran aground in Qinhuangdao, it was used to perform assistance work. Most of the Asiatic Fleet's warships are around the Philippines, allowing it to overwinter in Manila. Each year, the ships sail south, always between October and November, when the tropical rainy season has stopped and the climate in the Philippines is suitable for naval exercises.

Ships Cruise Throughout the Far East

In previous years, when the ships sailed south to overwinter, the Augusta always arrived in Manila last, because this ship always visited ports such as southern French Vietnam, Singapore, and Bali along the way. After overwintering in the tropics, the Asiatic Fleet sails north, cruising to various ports in China and Japan, and staying in Shanghai for quite some time. Then, the destroyers sail north to Yantai, using that port as their summer base. The submarine squadron accompanies the Augusta to Qingdao for the summer. The auxiliary ships are divided between the two ports. The destroyers also sail to Qingdao to dock for a few days. In addition to sailing to Manila for cruising every winter, the Asiatic Fleet also has two squadrons of gunboats, organized into the South China Patrol Fleet and the Yangtze Patrol Fleet.

### YMCA Enlists Donations for Winter Clothing, Distribution to Begin in Early December

The YMCA, in view of the high prices and the dire straits of the poor in this city, and in this cold weather and high rice prices, suffering from hunger and cold, a truly pitiful situation, with no relatives and no way to ask for help, will all become starving corpses. For this reason, on the 20th, it initiated a fundraising drive for 30,000 yuan for winter clothing for the poor, and various winter clothing items (including old clothes, bedding, shoes, hats, etc., donations are welcome). Since the beginning, all sectors have given enthusiastic support. The YMCA has specifically stipulated that the enlistment period will last until the end of December, and distribution will begin in early December. Before distribution, all old clothes and bedding donated by all parties will be disinfected to avoid the spread of disease, which would further burden those already struggling with poverty and illness. In order to promote the effort more broadly, the YMCA also printed tens of thousands of large posters with the words "Shanghai YMCA Enlists Donations of 30,000 Yuan for Winter Clothing for the Poor" in red, and decided to ask the Shanghai Public Bus Company, the British Electric Traction Company, major companies, major businesses, and the French Electric Traction Company to post them in the carriages and display windows to spread the word and achieve twice the result with half the effort.

### Argentine Ship Norta Carries Cotton to Shanghai

The Argentine merchant ship Norta (SSNORTE), managed by the foreign department manager of Jardine Matheson, carried a large shipment of cotton from Santos, USA, totaling 30,810 bales. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th of this month, but for some reason, it was delayed. According to inquiries with the company yesterday, it was said that it could arrive in Shanghai last night. If it did not arrive last night, it will definitely be able to enter the port this morning and dock at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.

### Cochran Holds Full Day of Office Yesterday, Meets with Shanghai Financial Community to Provide Information on the Actual Situation of Shanghai's Finances

Mr. Cochran, the special financial commissioner sent by the US to Shanghai to investigate the local financial and external relations, worked all day yesterday at the US Consulate General, meeting with responsible persons from Chinese and foreign banking circles to inquire about the situation of foreign exchange controls and trade conditions. From 10:00 am to 6:00 pm, he returned to the Capital Hotel to rest. According to the New Life News reporter, among the guests received by Mr. Cochran at the Chinese consulate yesterday, the responsible authorities of the National Bank were also on the list. Representatives of banks such as HSBC, Citibank, and Chartered Bank also went to visit. Well-informed sources revealed that Mr. Cochran's visit was in the name of a representative of the US Treasury Department, rather than as an American member of the Exchange Equalization Fund. The mission to Shanghai was not officially reported to the parties concerned in advance, so the bankers' interviews with Mr. Cochran were only to introduce the actual situation in various fields and provide the most prioritized information for Mr. Cochran to use as reference in preparing the investigation report.

Paying Attention to American Economic Aid to China

It is learned that Mr. Cochran, while in Hong Kong, openly stated his mission to China, saying, "I am here in the capacity of an official of the US Treasury Department to discuss financial issues. There are three points I am paying attention to, namely, the stability of the Chinese legal tender, the control of frozen Chinese funds, and other economic and financial issues, including American economic aid to China." Mr. Cochran is an old friend of Mr. Fox, the American member of the Exchange Equalization Fund, and served as a counselor at the US Embassy in Paris, France. During his tenure, he contributed greatly to the promotion of US-France trade. Recently, as a special commissioner of the Treasury, he is a powerful assistant to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau.

The Equalization Authorities Have New Decisions

A reporter from the New Life News learned from the competent authorities yesterday that the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee and the Foreign Exchange Management Authority have made the following decisions regarding the improvement of China's economy, finance, and financial sectors: (1) Strengthen efforts to urge Britain and the United States to promote the external transportation of goods produced in the interior by all relevant transportation institutions in China, in order to increase China's foreign exchange income. (2) Increase the management of domestic and foreign funds in order to promote the liquidity of commercial finance. (3) After eliminating the black market in Shanghai, guide the internal transfer of floating capital in Shanghai, and take the same steps for the black market and floating capital in Hong Kong.

### Japanese Authorities Conscript Dredger; Crew Resign En Masse; Japanese Attempt to Charter Vessel to Dredge Kure Naval Port; Russian Captain Sympathetic to Chinese, Dismissed; Japanese Water Police Arrest Two Chinese Crew Members

The Shanghai Dredging Bureau's giant dredger "Jianshe" (Construction) was suddenly requisitioned by the Japanese for six months to dredge the Kure naval port in Japanese territorial waters near Vladivostok. The crew of over one hundred unanimously opposed this, and all resigned, taking a firm stance. Consequently, two crew members were arrested by the Japanese. Our Datong News Agency reporter investigated the situation, as follows:

Construction Vessel Built in Germany

The "Jianshe" dredger of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau is one of the largest dredgers in the world, built in Germany. It arrived in Shanghai in April of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933] for handover. The vessel is 360 feet long, 60 feet wide, with a draft of 18 feet, and an hourly dredging capacity of 3,000 tons, making it one of the world's largest trailing suction hopper dredgers. Its original purpose was for dredging the shoal outside the Wusong estuary.

Requisitioned for Kure; Dredging Naval Port

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War [1937], the vessel has been detained by the Japanese. It was returned last year, but the machinery was damaged, requiring the Bureau to repair it at a cost of 200,000 yuan. Immediately after the repairs were completed, the Japanese suddenly sought to charter it to Kure to dredge the naval port, with the entire crew, including the Russian captain and over 130 Chinese crew members, to be transferred.

Crew Oppose; Two Arrested

Initially, the Japanese were secretive about requisitioning the "Jianshe" for Kure. The crew only realized the plan when photographs were being taken for their passports. They unanimously expressed their opposition. The Russian captain also sympathized with the Chinese crew's position and refused the transfer. The Japanese then instructed the Bureau's Japanese engineer, Fujisawa, to replace the Russian captain of the "Riyou" surveying vessel with a Japanese captain and dispatched Japanese military police along with Japanese water police from the patrol station to guard the "Jianshe," arresting two Chinese crew members who went aboard.

Refuse to Board; Passive Resistance

Upon learning of this, the entire crew was extremely indignant and refused to board the vessel, engaging in passive resistance. The "Jianshe" is a specialized technical vessel, and the crew members were all trained by the German captain who came with the ship at the time. The German captain only returned to his country after the training was complete. Therefore, the vessel cannot be operated without this crew.

Bureau's Notice; Statement of Guarantee

The Shanghai Dredging Bureau issued a notice to the crew yesterday, stating: "To the crew of the 'Jianshe': Upon investigation, your departure from your posts is due to misunderstanding. The Bureau hereby solemnly declares that for all who return to work or report to the Bureau, the Bureau guarantees your personal safety and there will be no problems. Even if the vessel is transferred, whether the crew wishes to go is entirely up to your free choice. The Bureau's care for you is well known. It is your duty to return to your posts as soon as possible, otherwise you will be bringing trouble upon yourselves. Please consider this carefully. This notice is hereby issued."

### Increase in Overseas Postage; Officially Implemented; Effective from the First Day of Next Month

Guo, the Director of the Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications, issued a notice on the 16th of this month to increase overseas postage by 100% from November 1st of this year. The reason for the increase is that expenditures are high and revenue cannot meet them. Our Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday that the bureau had received the order for the increase. However, the order did not specify whether the increased rates would apply to (1) Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou Bay, etc., or (2) Japanese airmail. The Postal Administration will await further instructions to decide. For other regions, the rates will be increased from that date: (1) Ordinary letters from 50 cents to one yuan; (2) Registered letters from one yuan to two yuan; Double registered letters from one yuan fifty cents to three yuan (4) Express letters from one yuan to two yuan; (5) US-China airmail, British overseas airmail, and other airmail routes will also be subject to a 100% increase in postage. All postal branches received the bureau's instructions yesterday.

### Radio Operator Arrested; Further Arrests to Follow

The English-language "China Press" reports that the French Concession police discovered a secret shortwave radio station within the Concession last Friday and arrested five radio operators. The person managing the station was General Molochkovsky, who had served as an advisor to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The next day, personnel were dispatched to Molochkovsky's residence for questioning. To avoid interrogation, Molochkovsky shot himself in his residence. It is reported that the five arrested radio operators are now being held and questioned by the Japanese authorities. The details of the investigation are not yet known, but it is rumored that one of the arrested has confessed to the involvement of several others in the secret radio station. The Japanese are currently continuing their investigation and it is expected that they will coordinate with the Concession police to make further arrests in the coming days. The arrangements for Molochkovsky's burial are not yet known.

### Three French Ships; Departure from Shanghai Postponed; "Datada Nanming" to Set Sail at Noon

According to news from the French Navigation Company yesterday, the company's "Datada Nan," "Lie Kangte Lile," and "Beina Shengting Bira" vessels have been delayed due to incomplete loading. The "Beina Shengting Bira" was originally scheduled to depart yesterday morning but has now been rescheduled to depart for Haiphong, Annam, at 4:00 PM today (the 28th). The "Lie Kangte Lile" and "Datada Nan" vessels will depart at noon tomorrow (the 29th). The "Lie Kangte Lile" is sailing via Haiphong to load coal for Shanghai, while the "Datada Nan" is sailing to Manila and then Saigon. It is reported that in addition to carrying 150 American passengers to the Philippines, the vessel is also carrying over a thousand tons of food such as potatoes and onions to Manila. Currently, shipping between Shanghai and Manila is entirely maintained by the vessels of the French Mail Company. It is reported that the American President Lines has advised passengers traveling to the United States to travel from Shanghai to Manila and then transfer to an American ship to the United States.

### American Criminal Tait Pang; Extradition Begins Tomorrow

Tait Pang, the former deputy executive officer of the US Narcotics Bureau in China, has been sentenced to five years of imprisonment. He is being escorted back to the United States for execution by Mins, a retired police officer from the Shanghai International Settlement. Originally scheduled to depart Shanghai today (the 28th) on the French mail ship "Datada Nan," the departure has been postponed to Wednesday, so Mins's escort of the criminal Tait will also be delayed by one day.

Li Quesun Urges Return to Shanghai

Li Quesun, the executive officer of the US Narcotics Bureau who appointed Tait Pang as deputy executive officer, hurriedly returned to the United States several weeks before Tait's arrest. Hillier, the prosecutor of the Narcotics Bureau, has now telegraphed the US Department of Justice to urge Li Quesun to return to Shanghai to resume his duties immediately. Furthermore, the US Narcotics Inspector Helmick has already set off for China on the President Van Buren after his return trip to the United States. It is now reported that the President Van Buren has cancelled its voyage to Shanghai, so Helmick will transfer ships in Manila or Hong Kong, and will likely return to Shanghai in early next month.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Regulate Prices; Implementation Imminent; Speculators Make Last-Ditch Efforts

According to reliable sources in official circles obtained by our Datong News Agency reporter, the Consular Body's application for the Shanghai Municipal Council to regulate prices is expected to be approved within two or three days. It is reported that the consuls of various countries are currently seeking instructions from their respective governments. As of yesterday, no replies have been received. It is understood that this matter is not as simple as generally believed, as the new bylaws may conflict with the rights and interests stipulated in treaties between China and various countries, and therefore must be handled with caution. If the consuls of various countries did not need to seek instructions from their respective governments, there would be no need for such a lengthy delay.

Speculators Exert Maximum Effort

The "North-China Daily News" reports that if the authorities of the two settlements do not take immediate action to control prices, merchants hoarding goods for profit will try their best to raise prices to the maximum extent before the price control measures are implemented. It is generally believed that those hoarding goods for profit know that the authorities will eventually implement price control measures, so they are now exerting their last efforts to raise prices sky-high. Therefore, after news of the Shanghai Municipal Council's decision to regulate prices was released, the prices of various commodities immediately reached new records.

An Inevitable Showdown Ahead

The "North-China Daily News" reports that there have been various rumors circulating in recent days, believing that if the Shanghai Municipal Council wants to punish speculators and greedy merchants in the city, it will inevitably have to confront some well-connected individuals with political backgrounds. For example, some cotton yarn speculators are connected to certain political groups. Furthermore, after customs recently prohibited the export of cotton goods, the market price actually fell instead of rising, causing significant losses to Japanese merchants. It is common knowledge that those who control the cotton market not only possess huge capital but also have enormous political influence. It is rumored that someone started with a capital of 10,000 yuan to buy cotton yarn a few weeks ago and has now become a millionaire. It is rumored that several banks are now specializing in collecting cash and foreign exchange to serve as funding.

### Shanghai-US Mail Delivery; Shipped via Manila

Since the number of ships has decreased, the Shanghai Post Office has opened a new route through Manila to maintain expedited delivery between Shanghai and the United States. All mail from Shanghai to Europe and the United States, in addition to being shipped directly to the United States when ships are available, will also be shipped to Manila and then loaded onto ships across the Pacific Ocean to the United States, to avoid delays and difficulties in delivery.

Shanghai-US Airmail; Quantity Congested Due to the convenience of delivery, the Shanghai-US airmail line has been quite congested with designated mail. Yesterday (27th), a batch of airmail bound for the United States, Canada, Europe, and other regions was loaded onto a ship at 10:00 AM, connecting to US airlines in Manila for transportation to the United States. It is expected to arrive in San Francisco on November 10th.

### Chinese Citizens Traveling to Hong Kong; Can Apply for Passports; Obtain from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hong Kong Office

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hong Kong Office has consulted with the Hong Kong authorities to facilitate the entry of Chinese citizens. Chinese citizens can apply for passports. Any national of our country, regardless of where they come from, can enter Hong Kong at any time with a Chinese passport. The procedures for obtaining this passport are very simple. They need to provide three 4.5-inch full-face photographs, a passport fee of six yuan, fill out two application forms for a passport at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hong Kong Office, and have the application guaranteed with the seal of a reputable business. After verification, the passport will be issued within one week.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Strictly Prohibits Hoarding of Coal Balls and Foreign Rice; Limits Coal Ball Price to 19 Yuan; No More Than Half a Stone of Rice per Household per Week

Yesterday, prices in the city continued to rise. Except for cigarettes, soap, matches, and candles, almost everything increased in price. This phenomenon, which occurred before the Shanghai Municipal Council implemented price controls, was entirely caused by speculative merchants. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council, aware of this situation and fearing that the price of coal would rise as the weather became colder, has taken consistent steps with the French Concession Public Works Bureau to manage the price of coal balls. To prevent anyone from hoarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice, it reiterated its previous order yesterday, limiting the quantity of rice sold to prevent anyone from hoarding for speculative purposes.

Coal Ball Price Set

According to a statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, the Coal Ball Evaluation Committee, jointly organized by the two Public Works Bureaus, has now set the retail price of coal balls at 19 yuan (national currency) per city dan (110 pounds), delivery included. The above evaluation is scheduled to take effect from today (the 28th). The two Settlement Municipal Councils are currently planning the manufacture and market introduction of a "standard coal ball." Several leading coal ball factories in the city have, at the request of the two Municipal Councils, submitted samples of what they consider to be standard coal balls. These samples are currently being jointly studied by the two Municipal Councils, and it is hoped that soon a standard coal ball approved and managed by the municipal authorities will be available on the market.

Limit the Sale of Plain Rice

In order to prevent hoarding of plain rice, the Shanghai Municipal Council has issued a notice reiterating the order of May 14th, limiting the quantity of Shanghai Municipal Council rice sold. That is, no rice store may sell more than half a stone per week to each household, family, or organization, and buyers are limited to those who will use it themselves. At the same time, the quantity sold by rice stores to individuals must not exceed two dou. The above measures have been communicated by the bureau to all rice retailers for compliance. The bureau has also ordered the police to dispatch personnel to conduct strict inspections to ensure compliance. If citizens find any violations of the above regulations, they are requested to report them to the nearest police station for verification and action.

No Need to Panic About the Future of Food

Some rice shops in the city, using the excuse that the Shanghai Municipal Council rice had been sold out, suspended retail sales, causing panic among the common people. According to reports yesterday, various rice shops picked up delivery orders from the Xiangmao Foreign Company yesterday, ranging from seven to eight thousand bags per day, and rushed to the Swire warehouse to pick up the goods. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Council rice, which had already been sold out, was being sold by various rice shops yesterday. However, some rice shops still claimed that the Shanghai Municipal Council rice had been sold out and refused to sell it, causing difficulty for the common people to purchase rice. However, this situation should improve today, as the Xiangmao Foreign Company's allocation of foreign rice to various rice shops can be fully supplied. According to news from the shipping industry, 50,000 bags of Shanghai Municipal Council rice will arrive in Shanghai within a few days.

### Xin Cheng & Co. Manager Zhu Xiangrong Kidnapped Yesterday

Zhu usually used his No. 8202 car as transportation. At 10:50 AM yesterday, Zhu was working in his office when, unexpectedly, four kidnappers, three of whom were carrying handguns and one of whom was acting as a lookout, broke into the office. They threatened with their guns, prohibiting the staff from making any noise, and immediately abducted Zhu Xiangrong, who was standing next to the counter, and forced him into a No. 6635 car parked in front of the Meixi Bed Factory on Tongfu Road, speeding east. The whereabouts of the abduction are unknown. Afterwards, Shen Zengyuan, the company's accountant, reported the information to the police station to investigate the whereabouts.

According to detectives from the Central Police Station, the person carrying the bullets may have been afraid of being searched by nearby police officers, so they discarded the bullets on the church lawn. It is noted that in the past two years, two pistols and five bullets have been found on the church lawn, so this is the third time that weapons have been discovered.

### Veteran Painter Shen Xinhai Passed Away

Shanghai's famous painter, Shen Xinhai, was highly skilled and virtuous, a well-known master of painting, and a veteran of the art world. He passed away on the 27th. Shen Jun was renowned for his meticulous figure paintings at an early age. Although he was capable of painting birds, flowers, and landscapes, he rarely did so outside of figures. Therefore, few such works were circulated. After middle age, his artistry became more refined, his reputation spread throughout the country, and his paintings were highly sought after. In his later years, those seeking his work were even more numerous. His works were cherished by society. It is generally recognized that he was a master of the local painting scene, second only to Qian Jisheng of the Qing Dynasty. Shen Jun was a local native, 86 years old. Many of his disciples have achieved fame, including the late writers Zhu Liangcai and Sun Shoubo, and Xie Xianou is one of the most outstanding today.

### Layman Meng Lao Establishes Fund for Condolence Gifts

Therefore, they believed that Master Yin Guang was the only one in 200 years to promote Buddhist teachings and advocate the Pure Land school. They are currently preparing to establish a permanent memorial association for the Master. Layman Meng Lao did not have the opportunity to assist during his lifetime, so they wish to encourage the inheritance of his wishes and use the condolence gifts to spread Buddhism and assist the fund. With the joint initiation of the Xingci Buddhist monks, Zhang Jingjiang, Ming Lanting, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Fan Guchen, and Meng's relatives and friends, it is requested that condolence gifts be converted into cash to plant good roots, jointly reach the Land of Ultimate Bliss, and achieve the merits of generosity.

### Shanghai's Prostitutes (Part 1)

— Translated by Kequn

"At least fifty percent of Shanghai's citizens are infected with social diseases." So said a well-known venereal disease expert with fifteen years of research on sexually transmitted diseases.

After interviewing more than a dozen doctors and conversing with patients, my conclusion is that ninety percent of venereal diseases are initially transmitted by prostitutes.

Every time night envelops the city, women of various nationalities who engage in this profession begin to prepare for their work. These women are the "prostitutes" of Shanghai. They gather in every corner of the city because Shanghai needs the existence of prostitutes. They will remain, so they cannot be eradicated.

Standing on both sides of the road are the most common prostitutes in Shanghai. We can often see them dragging their imagined customers on both sides of Nanjing Road and Avenue Edward VII. There are thousands of them, and the price for a night ranges from two to ten yuan. These can be said to be the main spreaders of sexually transmitted diseases in the city. Most of them have no knowledge of sexual hygiene, and neither do those who patronize them.

Thousands of patrolmen cannot eliminate them from the streets. Sometimes when the police come to the prostitutes' street, there are no women on the street. They have all fled to another street or hid in a dimly lit place to take temporary refuge until the police leave the street, and then they reappear. In the public concession, about five hundred of them are arrested every month, but generally speaking, after being arrested, they can be released after paying a bail of about ten yuan each.

The entertainment venues on the roofs of major Chinese department stores in Shanghai are filled with prostitutes and tourists who come there to flirt. The price of these women is more expensive than those standing on the street. The price for a night ranges from eight to forty yuan. Some of them are young and beautiful, with an average age between thirteen and nineteen. They have no knowledge of sexual hygiene and are generally infected with infectious diseases. Most Chinese customers originally did not have these bad diseases, but after one night of passion, they became infected.

Behind Rue du Consulat is the most wretched red-light district in Shanghai, where the price of women is also very low—anyone can get any woman there for three yuan. According to a Chinese doctor, nine out of ten women in these brothels are infected with diseases. In fact, the brothels display the women in the windows. The prostitutes gather in one place, often sitting on stools behind large glass windows, exposing their jade legs, and giving passersby a seductive smile. Most of the customers in this kind of place are Chinese, and occasionally some foreign sailors also patronize them. The brothel owners often send people outside to watch, solicit business, and guide customers to the door. If a rickshaw puller brings a customer, the rickshaw puller can get a reward of fifty cents to one yuan.

In another corner of Shanghai, there are also similar brothels, but only foreigners—mostly Russians, although foreigners of other nationalities also often patronize them. The price set in this kind of brothel is four or five yuan for a woman. A foreign doctor—who has treated the prostitutes in this kind of brothel and people who have contracted diseases from there—told me that at least eighty percent of the prostitutes there are sick.

### Ministry of Education Announces Implementation of Two-Session System to Alleviate Difficulties for Children Unable to Attend School

(Chongqing Airmail) In view of the densely populated areas and the inability to accommodate children attending school, the Ministry of Education has specially formulated and announced the implementation of the two-session system. The method is recorded as follows: Article 1. This method is formulated in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Provisional Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education and Article 10, Paragraph 1 and Article 13, Paragraph 12 of the Implementing Regulations. Article 2. In areas with relatively dense populations, all short-term primary schools, simple primary schools, and lower grades of ordinary primary schools should adopt a two-session system in principle when they cannot accommodate children attending school. Article 3. The two-session system is divided into the following items and should be adopted by each school according to the school and local conditions: 1. Full-day, two-classroom, two-session system: two classrooms simultaneously accommodate two classes of children of the same or different levels, with one teacher teaching back and forth. The classrooms are best connected or in a 日-shape, with doors in the middle to facilitate teacher movement, or actually facing each other in separate rooms or in a 曲-shape. No partitions are set up at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines. Blackboards are placed obliquely against the wall. The teacher can take care of the two classrooms on the left and right from the same position. 2. Full-day, one-classroom, intermittent two-session system: one classroom and one other venue simultaneously accommodate two classes of children, who alternately enter the classroom intermittently for teaching by one teacher. Children who are not directly taught are led by student leaders to study on their own or engage in other activities. 3. Half-day, two-session system: one classroom accommodates two classes of children, with teaching in the morning and afternoon by one teacher. This two-session system is divided into the following two types: A. Children who are in school for the whole day study in the classroom for half a day, and the other half day is led by student leaders to do free work or activities in other venues. B. Children who are in school for half a day are assigned extracurricular work by the teacher for the half day they are away from school and are instructed to study on their own. 4. Full-day, half-day mixed two-session system: two classrooms accommodate two or three classes of children, one class is in school for the whole day, and the remaining two classes alternate between morning and afternoon. The teaching time for the full-day class and the half-day class must be alternately arranged. When the half-day class is taught, the full-day class should be assigned to self-study or extracurricular work. 5. Intermittent two-session system: one session accommodates two classes of children, who take turns teaching on alternate days. The class that is not directly taught should be assigned to self-study or extracurricular work. Article 4. For subjects that are convenient for joint teaching, the two classes of children should be combined for teaching as much as possible. Article 5. Teachers who implement the two-session teaching system should, in addition to meeting the prescribed qualifications, also be selected from those with better teaching performance. Their remuneration may be appropriately increased. Article 6. The operating expenses of schools implementing the two-session system may be appropriately increased. Article 7. Central primary schools and experimental primary schools in various places should earnestly implement the two-session system and publish the results of the implementation at any time for reference by other primary schools. Article 8. This method shall be announced and implemented by the Ministry of Education.

### Children's Library Stipulates Group Borrowing Method; Board of Directors Appoints Zhou Xixin as Librarian

The Shanghai Children's Library, in order to facilitate children who live far away to borrow books, has specially solicited various groups in the city, such as associations, to establish circulation stations to circulate books. The library has now received applications from fifteen groups in the city to set up circulation stations and is currently engaged in review and preparation procedures, which will be announced soon. The library has now specially formulated group borrowing methods to facilitate schools and children's education institutions to borrow books in batches for children in each school or institution to read on their own. The methods are recorded as follows by a Dahua News Agency reporter: 1. Schools or children's education institutions that want to borrow books in batches must first prepare a letter to obtain the library's application form, fill it out according to the format, affix the seal of the person in charge, and pay a deposit of twenty yuan. After review and approval, a group borrowing certificate will be issued to borrow books. 2. In addition to the borrowing certificate, group borrowing must also fill out a group borrowing slip, with a temporary limit of thirty volumes each time. 3. Group borrowing is limited to two weeks each time. When the term expires, staff will be sent to exchange new books and renew the loan for two weeks. After that, the loan will be renewed every two weeks. 4. Group borrowed books should be taken care of and should not be soiled, folded, torn, or lost. Otherwise, compensation should be paid at the current price. 5. When a group borrows books and pays a deposit, the library will issue a receipt as proof. The deposit can be refunded upon presentation of the receipt twice a year, from June 20 to 30 or from December 20 to 31. 6. Group borrowers have the obligation to report on the reader's status and compile various statistics. It is also inquired that the library's board of directors has appointed Ms. Zhou Xixin as the librarian. Ms. Zhou graduated from the Sociology Department of Hujiang University in 1933, went to the United States in 1935, and majored in sociology at the University of Michigan, obtaining a master's degree.

### Talking about Love

— Maosun

When young people mention "love," they immediately become animated. What kind of "love" do young people like to talk about? That is what Goethe said in the narrative poem "The Sorrows of Young Werther": "What young man would not fall in love? What young woman would not be good at cherishing spring?" "Falling in love" and "cherishing spring" are a kind of heterosexual love. Although this is also a kind of love, it cannot represent all of love.

What I call "love" is the emotion of love, which may also be said to be the feeling of love. Psychology simply divides emotions into several types, but it always cannot be separated from the "seven emotions" in our country's ancient books, namely joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hatred, and desire. In fact, among these seven emotions, love is the most important. Joy, anger, sorrow, fear, hatred, and desire, these six emotions, seem to be like the stars surrounding the North Star for love. Love is a hub of the other six emotions. Look, we are happy when we gain love, angry when we lose love, sad when we lose love, afraid when we fight for love, hate when we don't love, and desire when we love. Isn't this the common nature of people? I say that love is the basis of all emotions, who would say it is not appropriate?

Love is the hub of all emotions and the basis of all emotions. If we use it properly, we can gain happiness and success. If we don't use it well, it is enough to cause trouble and failure. Not only is the love between men and women like this, but the love for all of humanity in society is also the same. If you can fully express your love for all people, where will you have enemies? If you can show love to people everywhere, you will eventually be welcomed, respected, and helped everywhere. You love people, and people love you. A person who is loved by everyone naturally has a happy life, his environment is undoubtedly smooth, and his career will easily reach the point of success.

Scientists say that the creation of all things in the universe is a combination of "Affinity." However, the success of all undertakings in society is also initiated by "love."

What is the greatest force in the world? It is the power of love. What is the most useful emotion for mankind? It is love.

I sing praise of love, I support love, I want to make love the goal of my life, I want to make love the religion of my belief!

### The Lament of Old Maids

— Feile

Yin was the first to jump out of the "virgin circle."

When she walked down the aisle to the wedding march with him, the virgin front—her classmates—sneered and glared coldly. In their minds, Yin was simply depraved! At the very least, Yin was a pity, having lost the precious title of "virgin."

Married life is not necessarily as beautiful and fulfilling as imagined. Yin's husband struggles on the lifeline of life, and Yin's enjoyment almost falls below the standard.

Then, two children were born one after another. What they gave Yin was a whole day of busyness, a whole night of noise, laughter, sighs, and intricate emotions!

Where is Yin's beauty? ——No powder on her face, no oil on her hair, wrinkled clothes, loose socks! Some people might even suspect that she is a nanny at a nursery!

This is a powerful testimony that makes them (Yin's classmates) even more strengthen their virgin will:

"At least, my body is my own, I can play with it at will and sleep comfortably!"

"Why are you willing to ruin yourself?"

"There is no flower of marriage that does not wither and turn yellow!"

These ironic words were reverberating in Yin's eardrums. She seemed to want to argue, but, in the end, she replaced it with "silence." Ten years later.

Quite coincidentally, Yin ran into her classmates again. They had already said goodbye to youth and were heading towards the path of old maids.

Today's Yin looks very energetic and is especially complimented by them. Yin proudly stroked her second child, who she was carrying, and said:

"Jian is twelve years old, and his older brother Qiang is thirteen years old. They have both completed their primary school courses and are continuing their studies in middle school. After a few years of hardship, I have finally taken a breath."

"Not only that, but also my husband's comfort!" Yin deliberately added in a coquettish tone!

Yes, today is Yin's universe. Her words forced tears that were like a waterfall from their dry eyes.

This is music, using tears to pat the notes, and its name is "The Lament of Old Maids!"

Yin patted them on the shoulder:

"I don't want to return your tears, but there is something I can tell you. What marriage includes is not only the comfort of children and husband, but it also has the meaning of the true meaning of life.

"However, everything requires a kind of power to deal with. Who says that the happiness of marriage is not exchanged for courage? Just talking about the ridicule you gave me at the beginning is already enough to bear!

"If the center of the old maid front is to escape reality and shirk responsibility, then that is not acceptable! This will create a miserable score in your lament!" Yin parted from them, but she felt a little regretful:

"If I hadn't left their front early, who knows if I wouldn't be one of the people singing the high notes in the lament today?"

### Essay Contest Announcement Seven Experiences—A Lesson I Learned—

— Ruosi

My friend Wen Jun told me a story:

"What would you do if you encountered a highway robbery at night?"

"Is that so? How did you deal with it?" I was eager to know.

"I saw a man walking towards me, and I thought he had bad intentions. It was about twelve o'clock at midnight, and only a few streetlights were flickering in the cold wind; there were no other pedestrians, only his and my unrelenting footsteps were answering. The distance was gradually getting closer, and I knew that this was a critical moment, and I should prepare how to escape.

"So I simply walked up to him quickly, pretending to be a refugee, and begged him for help. I told him some fabricated history, saying how I had escaped from the occupied area after many detours, leaving only myself. I didn't meet my relatives and couldn't find a job, and I hadn't eaten for two days. I begged him to help me with the cost of a meal.

"He saw that I was wearing a long gown, reached out and touched it, and it turned out to be coarse cloth. He also saw my bitter face, which looked like I was in trouble, so he shook his head, meaning that he felt very sorry for me. Then he kindly dug out twenty cents for me."

"You actually accepted it?" I couldn't help but say, "And how did you determine that he must have been going to rob you?"

"When he left, the gun in his coat pocket bumped against my waist, and he smiled at me and said, 'Goodbye!' I originally wanted to return the money to him, who really wanted his alms? But I had more than ten yuan in my inner pocket. If I didn't accept his kindness, the money in my pocket wouldn't be mine either."

"You are so cruel!" I seemed to say with great discomfort, "It's unlucky for a robber to meet you."

He suddenly straightened his face and said, "Calmness is the first requirement for dealing with a dangerous situation, and wit is the only good friend to help you escape."

I was deeply moved by this lesson.

Fourteen The Life of a Hero

Originally, he himself and this Mr. Qian had overlooked one point—and the most important point! It was not until they walked into the accounting room of the Red Stage and met the backstage manager surnamed Su that this loophole was discovered.

"Of course, Mr. Wu's orders should be followed. And seventeen or eight years ago, who didn't know the name of Boss Wu? But... but..." After Xiao Jiqing heard Mr. Qian explain his intention, he put his hands in his trouser pockets and kept rummaging, as if he was showing a very embarrassed look; at the same time, he also turned two inhuman eyes from a pair of deep nearsighted glasses, frequently looking at Begonia's face. "But... but, please don't be angry, Boss Wu. Now that you have such deep and large scars on your face, let alone singing the shirts is no longer possible, even old men, old women, martial artists, and everyone who doesn't wear face paint, I'm afraid it won't work! No matter how thick the powder is, it may not be able to cover it up."

This is really clear to bystanders!

After he said it, Mr. Qian looked at Begonia's face again and couldn't help but frown.

However, how could they have thought that Begonia would be so uncomfortable in his heart when he heard this? He really wanted to escape immediately, because this was not only a fatal wound on his physical appearance, but also a fatal wound in his heart. (247)

### "Screen Villain" Wang Xianzai Passed Away Last Night, After 20 Years in Film, a Master of Villainous Expressions

— Yan Ciping

Mr. Wang Xianzai, a master of villainous expressions on Chinese screens, unfortunately passed away at six o'clock last night due to a lung disease, separating him from the film industry forever. Those in the industry who heard the news were all saddened, and people felt sorry that China's film performance had lost another excellent actor!

Wang Xianzai was from Yishui County, Shandong Province. He served in the Chinese film industry since 1932. After joining the Star Film Company, he became famous in the film world. Recently, he was a basic actor for the Guolian Film Company. After completing the two films "Home" and "New Sisters" a month ago, he continued to shoot "Survival Road" and "Daring," directed by Zhang Huichong. After "Survival Road" was completed, "Daring" was only halfway through filming when he suffered from "severe typhoid fever" five days ago. After he fell ill, Lu Yuanliang, the factory director of Guolian, and Han Langen, the director of affairs, and his friend Hong Jingling went to visit him. When Zhang Shankun learned that Mr. Wang's condition was critical, he immediately invited five Chinese medicine doctors to diagnose and treat him, and also invited Western doctors for emergency treatment. However, he eventually died of his illness. The funeral will be held tomorrow at the World Funeral Home.

Mr. Wang had an elderly mother at home and Wang Wei, one of today's famous drama actors. His wife, Ms. Yuan Zhuru, is also a basic actor for the Guolian Film Company. Mr. Wang's first wife passed away fifteen years ago. He lived as a widower for more than ten years until he married Ms. Yuan in Kunming in January of the seventh year. They were united by love, but who knew that only three years after their marriage, he would sadly bid farewell to Yuan forever. Zhuru grieved deeply, truly a woman of misfortune.

### Talking About Music on the Double Ninth Festival

— Zhuang Yifu

As the years and months pass, it is again the Double Ninth Festival. We people feel something when we see the scenery, and we borrow tunes to sing different feelings, which are expressed in operas and sung with great enthusiasm. For example, the "Dragon Mountain Banquet" from Xu Chao Tai He Ji's Eight Kinds. (Yang Shen'an also has a Tai He Ji with the same theme. Mr. Zhao Jingshen has determined that the current popular eight kinds are written by Xu). On the ninth day, Huan Wen was at Dragon Mountain, and the wind blew Meng Jia's hat off, causing everyone to laugh. Although everyone knows the story, the so-called scenery in the play is different, and there is a difference in the mountains and rivers. Looking at each other in tears, Meng Jia's expression changed and said: We should work together to serve the royal family and restore the homeland, why should we be prisoners facing each other. The language is borrowed, but how touching it is. And quoting Huan's biography, ascending the Pingcheng Tower and looking at the Central Plains, the loss of the homeland and the ruins of a hundred years are the responsibility of Wang Yifu and others. And one quotation is appropriate, which can be compared. On this joyous festival, embrace one and respond to chastity, and enjoy the wine and sing, also should be happy. Other songs, such as "Appreciating Chrysanthemums" in Bai Shun Ji, although it is also a good song for the time, should not be compared with the same language for enjoying the good time with wine.

### New Voices in the Art World

Standard beauty Xu Lai recently suffered from severe enteritis, which has reached a dangerous stage. She is currently being treated at Fumin Hospital. This news was revealed by Zhang Shichuan.

Tang Ruoqing has reached an agreement with the Shanghai Drama Company and will star in a play with the company. It was previously agreed that she would still perform her masterpiece "Hong Yijiao," but it is now said that a new script will be found.

Minhua's new work, "Song of Ancient China," has been fully completed after several revisions. The screening results are satisfactory, and it will be released in Jincheng next month.

"Home" will be released at the Great Shanghai Theater in the next issue. After the Great Shanghai screening is over, it will be screened by Huguang at ordinary ticket prices.

Bu Wancang's new work, "Ideal Wife," is mostly completed and is purely a comedy, starring Chen Yanyan. According to people in the film circle, the play is another unique performance in style and will definitely cause a sensation when it is released.

Zhang Shankun has officially stated that the rumors that Wang Xichun has joined the common stage are untrue.

There are plans to increase the prices of first-run cinemas in this city that screen domestic films.

Chapter 18 Swear to Sweep Away the Huns, Regardless of One's Own Life

Zhang Cangqiu said, "That's right. I hate that I don't have the chance to frankly tell him what I think. Brother Bai, why don't you take the opportunity to speak up when you don't blame us? You are often by General Wu's side. The General treats you well, and you should also advise him." Bai Er smiled and said, "General Wu is working so hard to fix things, almost forgetting to eat and sleep, and wants to make the broken mirror whole again to fulfill his private wishes. He originally wanted to..." Bai Twelve stopped here and changed his tone, saying, "This matter is very difficult for him. Since you are unwilling to go to the capital to do this, I have to politely decline the General. It is difficult for me alone to handle it." Zhang Cangqiu said, "Let's fight the bandits first." So everyone drank and talked about the situation outside the customs and in Beijing, until they were drunk before they dispersed. Bai Twelve went to see Wu Sangui to report back. He dared not directly tell Sangui what Zhang Cangqiu and others had said, but only said that they also felt that their strength was weak and feared that they would commit the crime of overstepping their authority, so they dared not go. Sangui also expected that Zhang Chen and others would not be willing to work for his private affairs, but he could not help them, so he had to give up. He secretly pondered the strategy of how to confront the bandits. When Li Zicheng received the news that the vanguard army had been ambushed while pursuing the enemy, Liu Zongmin was injured by an arrow, and many soldiers were lost, he was shocked and angry. He immediately urged his troops to advance towards Shanhaiguan. He also listened to Niu Jinxing's advice and sent another army, led by the brave general Yang Tianlin, to go out of the northeast border of Faning, bypass the Great Wall to the outside of Shanhaiguan, and attack Sangui's back, creating a very powerful momentum.
