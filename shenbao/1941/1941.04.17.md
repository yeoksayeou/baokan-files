In addition, the government would order manufacturers to produce new military equipment to supply to China. According to reports, the meeting between Song Ziwen and Hu Shih and President Roosevelt at the White House at noon today occurred after the signing of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact, which all parties recognized as having great significance. It was also learned that the US government's aid to China mechanism had begun to function, and China could immediately obtain tangible assistance to continue its war effort.

Washington - President Roosevelt announced yesterday that the United States had begun to list items for aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act. The President's remarks were in response to questions from reporters at a regular press conference. Previously, Chinese leaders here had expressed that the President had agreed to take new actions to increase material aid to China. President Roosevelt told reporters that the items for aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act would be drawn from existing inventory or obtained from new resources, but he declined to specify which goods. (Sixteenth dispatch from the Associated Press)

Washington - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that he was currently analyzing China's needs under the Lend-Lease Act, and that some supplies, including both new and old items, had been processed.

(Sixteenth dispatch from Reuters)

Washington - President Roosevelt stated yesterday that no event could change the United States' policy of assisting countries that have been invaded. The President's words were clearly directed at the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact.

(Sixteenth dispatch from the Associated Press)

Washington - Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, Mr. Song Ziwen, strongly indicated yesterday that President Roosevelt had agreed to take new actions to increase material aid to China. They hinted that a resolution would be announced soon. Accompanied by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Hu and Song met with President Roosevelt for a quarter of an hour. Upon leaving the Executive Yuan, they reiterated China's determination to fight Japan to the end. Mr. Song stated that the progress on the Sino-American stabilization fund agreement was extremely rapid, and that he had mentioned this matter to President Roosevelt. These observations, as well as Dr. Hu's comments and other indications, have given observers in the East confidence that two developments between China and the United States are imminent. Observers believe that these developments are: First, that the United States will finally give serious attention to the issue of military aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act. Second, that the stabilization fund agreement, announced at the end of 1940, will be signed and take effect soon. Some speculate that if this happens, Mr. Song may return to China in the near future. (Sixteenth dispatch from the Associated Press)

Washington - After participating in the meeting at the White House yesterday, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih stated that the United States would soon issue a statement regarding assistance to China under the Lend-Lease Act.

(Sixteenth dispatch from the Associated Press)

Chongqing - President Roosevelt's announcement that he would immediately provide substantial assistance to China in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act was met with great excitement and satisfaction here. It was especially valued because the announcement was made after the signing of the Soviet-Japanese pact. The United States announces increased aid to China every time Japan takes action.

Washington - Diplomatic circles here predicted yesterday that US-Soviet commercial talks would be temporarily stalled until the Soviet-Japanese pact became clearer. Comments on the pact remain inconsistent. Observers believe that if there is sufficient evidence that the pact will enable the Soviet Union to take a stronger stance against Germany in Europe, the United States will continue to work to improve US-Soviet relations. As for Japan, its relationship with the United States is on the verge of collapse, and there is little hope of improvement for the time being. Most observers here believe that the pact is sufficient to harm the interests of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Far East, as Japan will not have to worry about the rear when launching its southward advance.

### Rumor That Japan Will Adopt New Diplomatic Policy; US Commentator Lippmann Claims Japan Will Not Advance South Immediately

Tokyo - The Yomiuri Shimbun carried an article stating that Japan will rely on the friendly support of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union in the future and will concentrate on building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It also expected that with the establishment of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality agreement, Japan's foreign policy will take a new direction. It also stated that Japan was previously very worried about the international situation it faced because it had the anti-Axis vanguard, the United States, threatening it in front, and the Soviet Union, whose relationship with Japan was ambiguous, behind it. In the future, the danger from the rear has been eliminated due to the neutrality agreement. The amity between the Soviet Union and Japan has dealt the United States a severe blow, which must be greater than what most people believe because the United States has been trying its best to use the Soviet Union and the Chongqing government to contain Japan's advance, and the Chongqing government hopes to obtain more assistance from the Soviet Union. Japan can now develop its actions toward the United States, Chongqing, and the South China Sea more smoothly. The newspaper also advocated that Japan should adopt a new plan to deal with the war against China and to deal with the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and stated that a new era has been ushered in for the East Asian diplomatic situation, which has indeed provided a strong impetus for Japan's work to build a new order in Greater East Asia. (Sixteenth dispatch from Reuters)

Stockholm - A newspaper received a message from Berlin saying that the Germans believe that the Soviet-Japanese neutrality agreement can eliminate Japan's worries about the rear. If the United States enters the war, Japan is responsible for declaring war on the United States according to the Tripartite Pact. (Sixteenth dispatch from Reuters)

Tokyo - It was announced here yesterday that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is expected to arrive in Tokyo on the 22nd. (Sixteenth dispatch from the United Press)

Washington - American political commentator Walter Lippmann published an article in the New York Herald Tribune today, stating that although the Soviet Union and Japan have signed a neutrality agreement, Japan will not immediately launch a frontal attack on British and Dutch territories in the South Pacific. However, Japan will quickly concentrate its troops to prepare for a southward advance, while separately adopting aggressive actions in various places to test the defensive strength of each place and seek ways to deal with it. Japan has always been wary of the Soviet Union. Now that it has established a pact with the Soviet Union, it can boldly join the world war. Japan's permission for the Soviet Union not to help Hitler attack the Soviet Union is of no use because, in fact, Japan is unable to help Hitler. As for Stalin encouraging Japan to participate in the war against the Allies, it is actually weakening his own position in Europe. The establishment of the Soviet-Japanese pact has actually gained nothing for the Soviet Union. All it has gained is being more isolated from Germany. The Soviet Union does not feel safer because Japan guarantees not to attack it. Japan could not attack the Soviet Union in the first place. Now, ordering those who cannot attack the Soviet Union to declare that they will not attack the Soviet Union actually has no effect. On the contrary, there is no doubt that the Soviet Union will feel weakened if it increases pressure on the United Kingdom and the United States. The only result of the Soviet-Japanese treaty is to expand the war in Europe to the Far East. (Fifteenth dispatch)

### War Is Becoming Increasingly Serious: United States Reaches Critical Juncture; Secretaries of the Navy and War Issue Startling Statements: Prepared to Fight in Any Area

Senate Passes Increase in Naval and Army Personnel

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox stated yesterday, "The United States is at the decisive period of the current world war." Knox's words followed closely after those of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who stated that the US Navy and Army must be prepared to fight in the northern, southern, and central Americas, "or even in any area," to defend the United States and its territories. Secretary Knox, attending the House Naval Affairs Committee to testify on the strike mediation bill proposed by Mr. Vinson, stated, "I do not wish to make alarmist remarks, but based on the information I have received, I dare say that we are in the decisive period of the current world war. We are currently facing acute and difficult problems to accelerate production to meet the greatest crisis of the war." He also stated, "I see our country gradually falling into encirclement and isolation. If the countries currently at war were to fail, our country would be surrounded by enemies who dislike our system and ideals." At the same time, President Roosevelt requested Congress to add $728,767,000 to next year's $6,000,000,000 Army budget, including $289,000,000 to build the Army Air Corps. (Sixteenth dispatch from the Associated Press)

The bill was sent to the White House yesterday. (Sixteenth dispatch from Reuters)

Editorial

### Prospects for the Pacific Situation

The establishment of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality agreement, regardless of whether it was promoted by recent developments in Eastern Europe, undoubtedly still has a direct impact on the Far East. It is akin to adding some enzymes to the turbulent Pacific Ocean. The Far Eastern crisis, which has lasted for nearly ten years, has formed turmoil because the countries concerned have failed to cooperate fully. People who care about world affairs have shown eager expectations for this. However, up to this day, not only has it not been effective, but the Soviet Union has also explicitly stated in the signing of the agreement with Japan that it is not interested in this task, to avoid hindering the "completion" of each other's historical tasks. Regardless of whether there are other unavoidable reasons and inevitable causes in this, from the perspective of the Far East alone, it cannot but be admitted that it is a regrettable disappointment.

Just two days before the signing of the Soviet-Japanese agreement, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe received reporters from various newspapers and stated that Japan had no intention of using force to implement its southward advance plan and claimed that he believed that there was nothing between Japan and the United States that could not be resolved peacefully. Adjusting relations with the Soviet Union has always been regarded as one of the prerequisites for Japan's southward advance. Moreover, in fact, after the conclusion of this agreement, it has reduced Japan's worries about the north and given Japan the possibility of mobilizing troops stationed in Northeast China to defend against the Soviet Union, all of which are important conditions for the implementation of southward aggression. However, Konoe publicly stated before signing the agreement that Japan had no intention of implementing a southward advance by force, which is somewhat surprising. In fact, the signing of the agreement with the Soviet Union is beneficial to the southward advance, but it does not mean that the timing of the southward advance is completely ripe. Perhaps some people in Japan have fantasies about advancing southward immediately after the agreement with the Soviet Union is signed, but that obviously cannot represent the intention of the Japanese authorities. From the perspective of the entire trend of the Japanese political situation, the so-called plan to establish a high degree of national defense was recently strengthened by a partial cabinet reshuffle. In terms of international relations, the struggle between Britain and Germany has not yet reached the final decisive moment. Moreover, if there is still room for continued development in economic southward advance and political manipulation, force is not a tool that must be used immediately. Analyzing Konoe's intentions, it is clear that because the southward advance issue has not reached the final stage, he wants to give the world the impression before the news of the signing of the Soviet-Japanese agreement is announced that Japan is not prepared to use force to avoid causing a strong international reaction due to the spread of that news. Konoe then stated that Japan's foreign policy would not change after Matsuoka returned to the country. His statement on the signing of the Soviet-Japanese agreement was also vague and did not greatly exaggerate or boast of success, which clearly came from the same intention.

However, regardless of whether Japan has the intention to immediately engage in a southward advance by force, the crisis in the Pacific has deepened due to the existence of the Soviet-Japanese agreement. If the European war were to repeat the unfortunate scene of last spring at this time, then the South Pacific would have no chance of surviving. The United States has paid close attention to this and has repeatedly made strong statements: On the 14th, US Secretary of State Hull issued a formal statement to reporters stating that the United States' policy remains unchanged. The day before yesterday afternoon, Roosevelt solemnly declared again that the United States would immediately and rapidly give China definite and powerful assistance without delay. In addition, it is rumored that the United States will soon issue a statement on assisting China under the Lend-Lease Act, and the Sino-American stabilization fund loan agreement announced last year will also be implemented. If the signing of the agreement with the Soviet Union is enough to promote the outbreak of the Pacific crisis, then the firm attitude and steps of the United States are enough to offset that force. The rise and fall of these two trends depends on the comparison of the strength and size of these two forces.

Looking at the various aspects of the Pacific, one side has changing factors, and the other side has unchanging factors; the impact of the European war and Japan's movements belong to the former, while China's war and the United States' actions belong to the latter. Although these unchanging anti-aggression factors have not yet secured an active position and therefore do not have the power to grasp the overall situation, if their strength can be rapidly increased and various effective measures can be quickly implemented, then the effect of quantitative change to qualitative change can occur at any time, changing from passive to active. This process is currently continuing to progress. The steps recently taken by the Soviet Union have only passive significance for the Far East. Although it is not prepared to block Japan's southward advance, it will not give it active support except for some objective influences. Therefore, unless the Axis powers can quickly achieve a decisive victory in Europe, as far as the Pacific itself is concerned, as long as it is good at using the principle of responding to all changes with the unchanging, there is no reason to be pessimistic.

German planes have been bombing Kochani from the beginning, indicating that it is an important base for the forward outposts of the British-Greek allied forces. (16th United Press dispatch)

London, it is reported that the British-Greek forces are now holding the area extending from Mount Olympus northwest to Koritza. Greek troops are being transferred back from Albania and have established contact with the left wing of the British forces. Although German pressure is increasing daily and they have launched several fierce attacks, the rumors transmitted by Ankara that the German forces have broken through are completely untrue. Responsible officials here strongly deny the German propaganda that the British Imperial forces have withdrawn from Greece. (16th Reuters dispatch)

Athens, according to the details announced here regarding the Greek army's withdrawal from the northern sector of the Albanian front, the Greek retreat was very orderly and secret. Military supplies and artillery were taken along, and bridges were destroyed. The retreat lasted three days, and the Italian forces only learned about it on Sunday and entered the Koritza area. The Greek army's small covering force has also withdrawn without any losses, and the British-Greek defense line has been unified. Parts of this line are in areas where mechanized units are difficult to operate. (16th Reuters dispatch)

### Bulgarian Army Enters Thrace, Causing Deep Concern in Turkey

Istanbul, reliable Bulgarian sources recently stated that Bulgarian troops have begun to enter the occupied areas of Thrace from Alexandroupolis to the Struma River. Turkish political circles unanimously acknowledge that this Bulgarian move is an act of aggression. However, these sources believe that the official statement about not intervening in support of Greece based on the Balkan Entente conditions must mean that the Entente has been dissolved in fact since Romania joined the Axis powers.

### Nazi Air Force Bombs Key Greek Port, British Aircraft Disrupt German Transportation

Berlin, German sources claim that the German military's mission is to destroy the British forces in Greece. Therefore, British ships in the port of Piraeus are constantly being bombed. According to the Germans, most of the British ships in the port of Piraeus came from Egypt, waiting to transport British troops to Greece. The German air force has sunk four merchant ships with a total of 35,000 tons and damaged another eight ships. The port facilities are all on fire. The Germans also claim that the main goal is to occupy or completely destroy the port because it is the only good port in southern Greece, and without it, it will not be possible to withdraw from the sea. (16th United Press dispatch)

Berlin, German authorities announced yesterday that German aircraft bombed the port of Eleusis and the port of Piraeus in Greece on Sunday night. In Eleusis, two merchant ships of 6,000 and 5,000 tons were severely damaged, and the airfield was also bombed, causing a large explosion. In Piraeus, a large fire broke out. (16th Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Athens, on Tuesday morning, German Junkers dive bombers first bombed the port of Piraeus and had five shot down by Allied fighters. Several others were also severely damaged and may not be able to return to base. All Allied aircraft were damaged, but all British fighters returned to base. Allied bombers departing from bases in Greece launched a fierce attack on German transport, and the enemy forces concentrated in Yangnitse were heavily bombed. Enemy transport convoys near Piraeus were also strafed, destroying many vehicles. According to pilots who attacked Sofia on Sunday night, Sofia was bombed, a large fire broke out in the parking lot, and a munitions train was also hit by a large bomb, with an exceptionally loud explosion. The Allied air raids were aimed at disrupting German transportation, with freight stations, parking lots, and warehouses as the main targets. The freight yards were bombed, and fires broke out in many places. Two truck convoys in the yard were hit and exploded, indicating that they were carrying explosives. A British Air Force communiqué stated that enemy transport convoys invading Greece were attacked by British bombers in the Yangnitse and other areas, and enemy troops and military supplies suffered heavy losses.

### Serbian Army Retreats to Mountains, Will Launch Guerrilla Warfare, Bosnian Capital Occupied by Germans

London, authoritative sources announced today that organized resistance by Yugoslav forces against Germany and Italy has ceased. This situation is apparently due to the obstruction of communications between the various regions of the Yugoslav army, resulting in a lack of centralized command. Therefore, the Serbian army can only rely on guerrilla tactics. Many Serbian soldiers have fled into the mountains. Well-informed sources here believe that these Serbian soldiers can harass German and Italian troops for a considerable period. (16th United Press dispatch)

Berlin, the German military bulletin this afternoon stated that the remnants of the Serbian army are becoming increasingly disorganized. German mechanized units have occupied Sarajevo, and thousands of Serbian soldiers have surrendered their arms. (16th Haitong dispatch) Note: Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Yugoslavia. The assassination that sparked the last world war took place here.

New York, a correspondent for the Columbia Broadcasting System reported from "a certain place in Yugoslavia" that Yugoslav forces had recaptured Skopje and Nis and captured 20,000 enemy soldiers. The Yugoslav army also claimed to have isolated a German armored division and 400 German tanks. (16th Reuters dispatch)

Vichy, French military commentators recently received telegrams from the Balkans that Yugoslavs have concentrated their troops in the Monastir area to stop the enemy. However, the Axis forces in the area are still trying to consolidate their positions around Lake Ohrid. Sources in Yugoslavia say that except for some Croatian divisions, the entire Yugoslav army is still resisting the three enemies of Germany, Italy, and Hungary, and that the Yugoslav army's operations are not only intermittent but also directed by the General Staff, which is gradually rebuilding the defense line from the Dalmatian coast to Macedonia. The achievements of the Serbs in the Vardar and Morava river basins have been confirmed by official telegrams, which have been received by diplomatic personnel from Greece and Yugoslavia here. Therefore, diplomatic personnel from Greece and Yugoslavia are optimistic about the resistance of the Yugoslav army. These sources believe that, given the resolute resistance of the Yugoslav army, the German army may have to transfer more troops from other fronts and order them to enter the Macedonian theater through Bulgaria along the Struma River, because the Serbs still control most of the only railway from Belgrade south through Nis and Skopje to Thessaloniki.

Nazi Invasion of Yugoslavia Comes at a Significant Price

New York, The New York Times reported that Hitler's attack on Yugoslavia has come at a huge economic cost. The German army has now been forced to fight on two continents simultaneously. Hitler may have planned to launch a spring offensive in the Balkans, expecting Yugoslavia to cooperate and quickly strike at the British forces in Greece, but the result has been a complete failure, causing his supply lines in the Balkans to suffer and incur increasingly heavy costs.

### Yugoslav Territory Fragmented, Germany Recovers Former Austrian Territories

Budapest, political figures here recently reported that once the Balkan war ends, the borders of each country will be redefined. With the Independent State of Croatia having been recognized by the Axis powers, Yugoslavia will no longer exist. The territory between the Danube and Tisza rivers within Yugoslavia has already been occupied by Hungarian troops, and Hungary can restore its borders before the Treaty of Versailles. In addition, Lower Styria, Carniola, and Southern Carinthia have been occupied by German troops and may be incorporated into Ostmark. Bulgaria and Romania will demand parts of Yugoslavia.

### Libyan War Underway, Situation Gradually Stabilizing, British Troops Holding Strong Positions, Air Force Maintains Absolute Superiority

Cairo, Although the war in Libya is still underway, the situation is gradually stabilizing, as can be seen from information coming from Libya. Elite British troops are holding their positions in the most suitable areas and fighting. There is no reason for anxiety at present. According to German prisoners of war, they have been without food and water for two days and can no longer follow the order to advance as quickly as possible. The British Air Force maintains its absolute superiority in the sky and continues to bomb German supply convoys, so the German vanguard is increasingly unable to contact the rear. Since German dive bombers are no match for British Hurricane fighters, they are often hit by British land forces when flying low. German troops traveling by vehicle are constantly bombed by the British Air Force, resulting in increasing casualties. British patrols often raid from Tobruk at night, capturing enemy soldiers and disrupting the German army's advance towards the Egyptian border. The German army launched two attacks on British artillery positions yesterday, but both were repulsed with heavy losses. Since the German vanguard advanced quickly, the rear was neglected, so many captured British soldiers were able to escape safely. Two British officers seized a truck and sped towards Tobruk during a sandstorm. Although they were monitored by Italian soldiers, they could not be stopped. The British officers arrived in Tobruk before the German troops arrived in Mechili and warned the Tobruk defenders of the news that the British army had withdrawn from Mechili, putting them on alert. On Sunday, twenty German and Italian aircraft were shot down in the Tobruk area. This was due to the efforts of two British fighter squadrons. The British Air Force also continued to bomb and strafe enemy airfields, troop concentrations, and motor transport convoys in Cyrenaica on Sunday and Monday. Tripoli is the main base for Germany to send reinforcements to Libya and was attacked by British aircraft again on Sunday night. One ship caught fire, and the remaining ships were also hit.

British Troops in High Spirits

The British commander believes that if the enemy reaches the positions already selected by the British command, the outcome of the battle between the British and German forces will be favorable to the British because this defensive line was built last autumn to prevent Italian attacks and is still intact and even stronger than before. The soldiers who have returned from the desert and are being re-equipped are all in high spirits and optimistic about the situation because the British forces are gradually concentrating and the situation is becoming increasingly stable.

Situation on the East African Front

The South African fighter squadron operating in Abyssinia also strafed the Chima airfield, destroying two Italian aircraft. The British forces attacking Chima have reached the Omo River, 106 miles southwest of Addis Ababa, and the British forces advancing south from Adama have occupied Asela after crossing the Awash River at the Gergie Bridge without encountering resistance. The British forces seized a large number of spoils in Addis Ababa, including surveying instruments worth £1 million. (16th Reuters dispatch)

British Newspaper Comments on the War Situation

A military commentator for the Yorkshire Post stated that it will be debated even after the war ends whether the British should have advanced to Tripoli earlier to complete the conquest of Libya. However, we must realize that Libya is not isolated because Germany has decided to join the war in the Balkans as a backup for America, while the British army is still fighting in East Africa and cannot go elsewhere. At that time, the British had to choose from the following options: (1) Accept the German challenge in the Balkans. (2) Conquer Abyssinia quickly before the rainy season so that the British troops there could be released. (3) Concentrate forces on both the East African and North African fronts and allow the German army to advance south through the Balkans to the Mediterranean. If the British had chosen the third option, the German army would probably already be in Athens. However, the British decided to adopt the first and second options, willing to temporarily risk danger in Libya and wanting to transfer troops to Libya after conquering East Africa to adjust the war situation. This was indeed a sensible approach, and it is still possible to adjust the North African war situation. However, if the British allow the Germans to run rampant in the Balkans or hesitate to clear the East African war situation, it will be difficult to restore the previous situation and will take a year or more.

### Soviet Union, Germany, and Turkey Conduct Political Talks, Possible German-Turkish Non-Aggression Pact, British Military Representative Leaves Ankara for Egypt

It is reported that the German ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, has held several talks with Turkish President Ismet Inonu and other Turkish leaders.

### Halifax Discusses the War Situation: British Naval Power Undiminished, Certain to Achieve Final Victory

New York – British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax spoke last night at the English-Speaking Union in New York, discussing the British war situation. He pointed to the Balkans and North Africa as the "black spots" in the war and revealed some of the behind-the-scenes diplomatic maneuvering before the German attack on Greece. He stated that when the Southern countries were attacked, their mobilization was not complete, and the staff talks previously rejected by the former government of the Southern countries had not been effectively implemented. To aid both Greece and Southern countries, the British diverted a portion of their troops from North Africa, resulting in a reduction of military strength there. The British were well aware of the danger involved, but felt they could not fail to aid their brave Greek and Southern allies. This was the reason why the British forces in North Africa had to retreat from Libya. Although this move resulted in losses for us, the enemy also paid a significant price for their advance. Currently, British reinforcements are being rapidly and continuously transported to the North African battlefield, aided significantly by President Roosevelt's approval of the resumption of American shipping in the Red Sea, which is truly rare. The British Air Force is also stronger than it was several months ago. The course of naval battles since the start of the war gives us reason to believe that British naval power has not diminished and will ultimately bear the brunt of toppling the Nazi regime. Lord Halifax also stated earnestly that he was speaking at a time of momentous decisions and called this period "the darkest hour for humanity," reiterating his complete confidence in eventual victory (Reuters, 16th).

### A Spectacle of the American Navy

After the enemy planes launched a large-scale attack, the American Navy broke through the enemy's destroyer formation. The enemy commander-in-chief was inevitably somewhat disheartened. In this situation, he already saw defeat as inevitable. The enemy still possessed one aircraft carrier with seventy-two aircraft, divided into four squadrons. Constant aerial combat had been ongoing since the beginning of the naval battle, with the American forces consistently holding the advantage. Now, the enemy was staking everything on their seventy-two aircraft, attempting to inflict heavy damage on the American main battle fleet.

An enemy squadron of bombers, protected by a squadron of fighters, approached with massive bombs. American fighters immediately took off to engage them, but a few enemy planes managed to break through and dropped some relatively insignificant bombs. Another squadron of dive bombers roared down from an altitude of eight thousand feet, as the American fleet's anti-aircraft guns and machine guns opened fire simultaneously. The enemy only managed to hit the stern of one battleship with two bombs.

Finally, a squadron of aerial torpedo bombers sped in, led by two smoke-laying aircraft, which deployed a screen of smoke between the formidable cruisers and destroyers, protecting the bombers from being hit. The bombers released their torpedoes at a height of twenty feet above the sea. At this moment, several guns on the battleship fired, and the shells landed in front of one bomber. The resulting impact of the water column destroyed the plane. In an instant, these torpedo bombers emerged from the smoke, about two miles away, forming a formation to attack the American battleships and released their torpedoes into the water. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the American ships immediately changed course and altered their formation to avoid them, but one battleship and one destroyer were hit by torpedoes. Not a single enemy plane flew away at this time, and they were still wreaking havoc.

Establishing a Final Position. The enemy's faster battleships began to approach the American line, moving out of range of the artillery fire. To counter this move, the American naval commander-in-chief immediately dispatched a vanguard consisting of Chester-class cruisers to break through the enemy's cruiser vanguard. Because he had superior speed, he was successful. Now, with a large force of destroyers, he attacked the enemy battleships, constantly bombarding them with mines and five-inch guns. The enemy formation gradually faltered, and the ships turned away, changing their formation to avoid being attacked by mines.

It is not yet known whether the commander-in-chief will be able to achieve final victory in this battle. If things go poorly, the entire navy could be damaged, and even the fate of the entire nation could be decided by this battle. The crucial moment of this half-hour battle has arrived. He must now use all his strength to break through the enemy's main formation. He issued an order for his fleet to establish a final position, protecting the battleships that were about to engage in combat. Heavy cruisers, serving as the vanguard, headed straight for the enemy. To prevent further attacks from enemy submarines and destroyers, all the destroyers formed a broad screen to protect the battle line. All actions were directed by the flagship in the center of the battleship line. The twelve 14-inch guns on the flagship USS Idaho were aimed at the enemy ships, but the barrels were not yet raised. All the guns were "ready to fire." (To be continued)

### Along the Border of the New Territories: Germany Hastens to Build New Fortresses, Soviet Border Defenses Also Strengthened: German-Soviet Suspicion Difficult to Eradicate

London – According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily News, Germany is currently intensifying its long-term preparations for a final invasion of the Soviet Union. Fortresses have already been built along the German-Soviet border in Poland, and the Germans are now building new fortifications behind them. They are also constructing airfields from south of Warsaw towards Lviv, extending to the Polish plains border. According to a dispatch from the Svenska Dagbladet's correspondent in Budapest, the situation in Eastern Europe is extremely alarming. Soviet border defenses have been strengthened, and German troops are arriving in a steady stream from the west, some transferred from the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. German proclamations have been found in the Lviv region, designating forty-three villages to be evacuated by May 1st. In addition, twenty-one more villages are listed, instructing refugees not to go there. According to reliable sources, the reason for these evacuations is to expand underground airfields and build fortifications along the Warsaw-Lviv railway line (Reuters, 16th).

### Northern Ireland Suffers Unprecedented Bombing: British Planes Heavily Attack Northern Germany

London – British Air Force bomber squadrons carried out a heavy bombing raid on the German naval port of Kiel on the 38th. On the same night, powerful German bomber squadrons launched a heavy raid on Northern Ireland for several hours. German radio admitted that many houses were destroyed last night and British planes dropped bombs on northern Germany. A communiqué issued by the Northern Ireland Ministry of Public Security stated that almost the entire region of Northern Ireland was bombed for several hours by large German bomber formations with varying degrees of intensity. Some areas were indiscriminately bombed, damaging several factories, and many bombs landed in residential areas. There were fears of numerous casualties. Two churches, a cinema, a library, and a hospital were hit. After ten buildings and a nursing home in the hospital were hit, doctors and nurses rushed to move patients out of the hospital and then treated the injured. The areas where workers resided were the worst affected. According to an Air Ministry communiqué, enemy aircraft activity last night extended throughout the British Isles. Bombs were dropped in many areas, but none could be described as a heavy raid. Several shops and houses were damaged in some areas, and a few factories were also damaged. Casualties were few (Reuters, 16th).

London – It was officially announced that the British cruiser HMS Dunedin was torpedoed and sunk while escorting a convoy. The ship displaced 5,450 tons and was launched two years ago.

### Food: Rice Prices Rise Wildly, Unwilling to Stop: All Under the Control of Hoarders

Under the price hikes and speculation by major rice merchants and the cheering on of floating traders, the spot prices for various grades of foreign rice have once again soared. Although there is a lack of appetite from actual consumers and inventories are full, the holders of the rice only know to raise prices to make money, and new hoarders are recklessly buying up supplies. The market has been raised by two to three yuan without any justification. In the afternoon, "hat" traders began to chase after the market price, driving it up another two to three yuan. However, after the price rise, those who profited took the opportunity to sell at the high price, so the closing price fell back a little over two yuan, but it was still two, three, or four yuan higher than the closing price the previous evening. Number One Saigon opened at 124 yuan, Number Two at 121 yuan, at 120 yuan. Number One Siam Special opened at 124 yuan, Medium at 122 yuan, at 120 yuan. Fine rice opened at 122-123 yuan, while small-grain rice was even more popular, opening at 120 yuan. Tokyo polished special dropped from 115 yuan to 112 yuan, broken rice from 98-99 yuan to 95 yuan, and Wuhu special at 118 yuan. The transactions at Jardine Matheson were the most lively, with no less than 3,000 tons traded. Number One Saigon for April/May delivery was 140 yuan to 141 yuan, small-grain rice spot at 145-146 yuan, and broken rice at 115-116 yuan. In the afternoon, broken rice reached 120 yuan, and other types also rose by two to three yuan at one point. The market situation softened at the close, and prices fell by a little over two yuan. Small-grain rice opened at 120.05 yuan in the morning, reached a high of 123 yuan in the afternoon, and closed at 121 yuan. Transactions of various grades of rice totaled nearly 30,000 bags.

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Shipping Company's Haikou arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 14th) evening, carrying 17,341 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and berthed at the company's wharf in Pudong to unload. Also, the Guangdong arrived in Shanghai yesterday, also loaded with 3,300 bags of foreign rice and 469 bags of corn from Hong Kong. The Jardine Matheson's Cébessa arrived from Java with a large quantity of corn, over 34,000 bags, and arrived in port the morning before yesterday (the 15th), as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the regular passenger ship Tjisaroea arrived in Shanghai the afternoon of the same day, also loaded with over 8,000 bags of corn from Java. It also berthed at the Blue Funnel Line wharf in Pudong and is currently unloading.

Although the arrivals of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice are still limited, the domestic rice stores have weakened their purchases due to repeated price increases in the previous period. Therefore, the owners are unable to push up prices, and the market has formed a stable situation. High-grade clear special japonica is still 128 yuan, high at 126 yuan, Kunshan premium special japonica is 125 yuan, dropping to 120 yuan, Qingjiao premium thin rice is 118 yuan to 117 yuan, original package at 111.5 yuan.

The path for glutinous rice is affected by the usual Qingming Festival decline, and the market is already expensive, so even though foreign rice continues to surge, it is difficult to keep pace. It has only tightened slightly. Hong Kong Special opened at 115 yuan, dropping to 110 yuan, glutinous rice at 104 yuan to 100 yuan.

### Flour Follows the Rice Market and Stays Firm

Flour: Yesterday, the market initially weakened and stabilized. In the morning, due to the arrival of 20,000 to 30,000 bags of Canadian flour newly imported by the Kung Lee Yanghang and unloaded at the Pudong godown, with continuous arrivals expected, sentiment softened. Therefore, the Golden Cage brand Canadian flour retreated to within the 30 yuan mark to 29.8 yuan, and the Flower Island brand Australian flour retreated to 30.03-30.04 yuan. However, the market soon stabilized because rice prices rose again by 2 yuan, and there was continuous demand from northern and southern customers. The disposal of domestic flour also revived, and the situation immediately felt firmer. Flower Island flour immediately rose to 30.055 yuan, Golden Cage brand to 29.9-30 yuan, with 14,000 bags traded. Chinese factories continue to supply flour at a flat price, with no changes expected this month.

Wheat: Yesterday, purchases and sales remained scarce. Because the supply of domestic wheat has been exhausted, it is difficult to purchase entire batches of spot goods. Therefore, Chinese factories rely solely on foreign wheat for raw materials. Japanese factories also occasionally purchase small amounts of wheat at the gate, with prices still between 45-46 yuan. The market is unable to develop for the time being.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Jumps Wildly by Nine Yuan, All Speculation

Yesterday's soybean oil market: initially, there was little movement because peanut oil remained flat. Afterwards, because the main holders of physical goods were unwilling to release them, this added another boost to the bulls. The squeeze became tighter and tighter, and the market soared, with Dalian spot oil skyrocketing by 9 yuan. 200+ barrels traded, with prices rising from 156 yuan to 165 yuan. Over 1,000 barrels for April delivery traded (all speculative), with prices climbing from 156.25 yuan to 164.5 yuan, a sharp increase of 8 yuan compared to the previous day. Factory oil initially weakened and was later boosted by about 2 yuan, with 400+ dan of Great China factory oil traded at prices of 110 yuan to 114 yuan, and 40 dan of Jihua factory oil trading at 112.5 yuan. Peanut oil was unchanged, with Jiaozhou oil at 50 pieces, priced at 119 yuan, Yantai oil at 30 pieces, priced at 115 yuan, canned oil at 500 cans, priced at 160 yuan, and Jiangbei local workshop canned oil also at 500 cans, priced at 160 yuan.

100 bags of soybeans were exported to Singapore on the 17th, and 20 bags to Hong Kong. 580 bags of sesame seeds were exported to Hong Kong.

### Finance: New York Pound Plunges Suddenly: Foreign Exchange Shows Slight Firmness

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed rates were unchanged. The sterling-US dollar rate in the black market was stable with a slight hardening. The sudden drop of 1.25 points in the New York pound was not yet widely noted, so it had little impact. Only Hong Kong telegraphic transfers offered 60,000 to 70,000 pounds of sterling. Speculators and Chinese banks offered US dollars. A rate of 5.3125 yuan was available for settlement this month, but the selling pressure soon subsided, and the market became static after 10:30. Sterling settled at 3 pence 234375 and US dollars at 5.28125 yuan, both the same as the previous day's closing price. Trading in the morning was normal. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Hong Kong Telegraphic Transfers Offered Sterling

The US dollar weakened by 1.25 points against the pound and by a small fraction against Shanghai. The Central Bank's listed rates were unchanged. Banks opened with the same spot selling prices in the morning as the previous day: sterling at 3 pence 234375 and US dollars at 5.28125 yuan. After opening, speculators first offered May US dollars at 5.3125 yuan. The market was stable. When HSBC announced its listed rates, they were unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was also unchanged. Afterwards, Hong Kong telegraphic transfers suddenly offered sterling, and at the same time, Chinese banks also had selling intentions. The market hardened slightly. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegraphic transfers sold sterling for this month to foreign banks at 3 pence 25, and Chinese banks sold US dollars for April/May at 5.3125 yuan. At this time, a certain American bank also had selling intentions at 5.3125 yuan, but Japanese banks suddenly came in to absorb it, and the market returned to flat. It is estimated that foreign banks absorbed US dollars for this month at 5.3125 yuan and 28125 yuan. Transactions decreased at noon, and the situation was calm. By closing, spot sterling was all at 3 pence 234375 and US dollars all at 5.28125 yuan. In the end, there were no gains or losses compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

### Gold Market Meanders: First Falls, Then Rises, and Finally Declines Again

Yesterday, the black market for pure gold rarely saw a good situation. Prices were often flat and weak. Due to the unstable trend and news of a Sino-American loan, most ordinary operators were cautious. Initially, the exchange market reported firmness, and Cheng Kee and Yi Da, etc., sold heavily. The lowest price fell to 6,523 yuan. Later, due to purchases by small holders, and soon the US dollar exchange rate suddenly became difficult to settle at 5.3125 yuan, a buying trend was sparked. Yi Da, Da Feng, De Da, Tong Kang, and Yong vigorously absorbed, and the price once reached 6,565 yuan. However, floating shorts were not long-lived and sold as soon as they made a profit. Therefore, by the close, it only reported 6,544 yuan, a small squeeze of 9 yuan. Spot trading was just over 10,000 taels. Xiang He's swap rate was over 250 taels, priced at 30 yuan. For cash, Yong Cheng initially offered Xiang Xing Yong at 50 taels, plus 185 yuan. Subsequently, Li Tai offered De Fu at 50 taels, plus 180 yuan. Later, the Gold Shop Group offered Lian Xing (representing the silver shop industry) at 180 taels, plus 175 yuan. At noon, Shun Yuan wanted to buy in at 175 yuan, but there were no sellers. As a result, the trading was 5 yuan smaller than the previous day.

Pure Gold Only Squeezed 9 Yuan

Initially, the price per bar (ten taels): initially, the market was weak. Cheng Kee pressed the price and sold heavily, and the market opened 13 yuan lower, reporting 6,540 yuan. It continued to fall by 10 yuan in the selling trend. Later, with Xiang He and Xin Feng Yong absorbing, it returned to 6,550 yuan. Afterwards, due to the slight loosening of the exchange market, selling pressure revived. Yi Da and Da Feng took profits, and Cheng Kee and Xing Yuan also followed suit, causing the price to fall to 6,525 yuan. At that time, Cheng Kee reversed course and bought, and Xiang Xing Yong's appetite was also good, and it rose back to 6,545 yuan. Soon, Yi Da's bulls continued to unload, and at the same time, Cheng Kee came to sell again, and it fell again to 6,523 yuan. After that, Jin Yuan and Xiang He absorbed, and the market rose again. Soon after, the news that the exchange rate was difficult to settle at 5.3125 yuan spread, and there were more buyers. Yi Da, De Da, Da Feng Tong Kang, and Yong competed to buy, and it once rose sharply to 6,565 yuan. However, floating shorts emerged at noon, and Jin Yuan, Xiang Xing, and Yong took profits, and Tian Yuan Yi Li also sold, causing it to fall to 6,538 yuan again. The closing price was finally reported at 6,544 yuan, a small squeeze of 9 yuan compared to the previous day. Based on the May US dollar exchange rate of 5.28125 yuan, the settlement price was 6,594.08 yuan, which was pressed down by 50.08 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 42 yuan in half a day. There was no market in the afternoon. The selling price of the cash gold bars from the main gold shops was 200 yuan higher than the pure gold forward trading price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the spot gold standard.

Ornamental Gold Again Listed Up 5 Yuan

The selling price for silver shop jewelry and ornaments was raised by 5 yuan, around 11 o'clock, by Da Tong Heng and Xin Tong Heng ,to 695 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 40 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Also Unchanged

Yesterday's foreign currency market: spot prices for pure gold, both forward and spot, were unchanged, so British and American gold pounds were also flat. British gold notes remained stable as before, and the market price remained flat. The opening price of US dollar notes was 4 jiao 5 fen, and after opening, it retreated to 4 jiao 1 fen, then rose to 4 jiao 8 fen, and the closing price retreated again to 18 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen, a squeeze of 1 fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes trended slightly weaker, while Japanese gold notes remained firm. The evening market rose to 1 yuan 9 jiao 9.5 fen. The supply and demand for Korean notes was even, and the market price remained flat. The evening market remained at 1 yuan 7 jiao 1 fen.

### Securities: Government Bonds Waiting for an Opportunity to Act

Government Bond black market: Yesterday's market situation, because of the continuous purchases of Tong Kang and Ding Kang, the market price was maintained and not firm. At the moment, it is still in a state of uncertainty. Therefore, investors invest, and speculators speculate, each with their own views, and everyone is waiting for future changes. At present, it is probably unlikely that there will be major ups and downs for the time being. Yesterday's transactions: in the morning, Tong Kang bought the most, followed by Ding Kang and Lian Yi, but Heng Fu, Wu He, and De Fu sold in abundance. The market price first fell slightly and then recovered. In the afternoon, Tong Kang and Ding Kang continued to buy, and Yi Kang also had an appetite, while Heng Fu and Wu He continued to sell. The supply and demand were not very disparate, and the price showed a slight recovery. As a result, highs and lows were seen. Grade B bonds rose by 1 jiao alone, while Grade A bonds rose by only 5 fen. This was an imbalance. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.7-1.8 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day
---|---|---|---|---
Unified Grade A | 74.80 | 74.20 | 74.65 | Down 0.05
Unified Grade B | 68.15 | 67.65 | 68.15 | Up 0.30
Unified Grade C | 65.70 | 65.35 | 65.70 | Up 0.10
Unified Grade D | 64.00 | 63.80 | 64.00 | Up 0.20
Unified Grade E | 63.90 | 63.40 | 63.90 | Flat

Stock trading: 10 shares of Silk Industry Bank were traded at a price of 29.1 yuan.

London, 15th (Tuesday) telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British Far East company stocks were all flat. Only Kula Kelin Rubber shares rose by 3 pence, to a price of 15 shillings. There were no other changes.

### Yarn and Cotton: Profit Taking Emerges, Double Horse Price Increases Stabilize

Hong Kong Sales Not as Strong as the Previous Day

Yesterday, the yarn market, which had risen sharply the previous day, was slightly more stable. This was due to profit taking, which caused the counters to loosen up. As for the Hong Kong traders, they only bought 900 bales, and the transactions were not as strong as the previous day. At the same time, the foreign exchange market was also quiet, so market sentiment was more moderate. Transactions on the floor decreased, but the large amounts held by the same industry remained unchanged. However, most securities traders were still short, so the market entered a two-sided struggle again. Considering that it had risen by more than 60 yuan the previous day, it was too sharp, and when the price increase stopped, it naturally triggered profit taking. In short, fine yarn prices are very high, and cloth prices are high. If there are no unexpected changes, 20-count yarn will not have a big drop. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,494 yuan, and the low price was 1,475 yuan. The first trade in the afternoon was at 1,480 yuan, then at 1,488 yuan, and finally at 1,486 yuan. 1,900 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong today.

Double Horse Opened Firm This Morning: The opening price for the first trade was 1,492 yuan. However, the momentum at the counters was quite weak, because most of the bulls were taking profits, and securities traders were selling, so the number of sellers in the ring exceeded the number of buyers. After that, the market slowly declined to 1,475 yuan, but as soon as the low price was seen, profit takers picked up bargains, and new buyers were active, and the price rose to 1,485 yuan. However, the sales of spot yarn were not as strong as the previous day. Until after 11:00, a rumor suddenly arose on the floor that a certain foreign yarn factory had a labor dispute, and buying orders revived, rising as high as 1,494 yuan. Then, after hearing that this matter was unfounded, the market returned to 1,482 yuan at the close. The day's transaction statistics totaled 6,600 bales. The amount bought by various groups is listed on the left: Hong Kong 900, same industry 5,700, total 6,600.

### Cotton Market Active

Both Brokers and Factories Have Large Transactions

The current cotton situation remains firm, because people are optimistic about higher prices. At the same time, factories are actively seeking supplies. Therefore, although the report on foreign cotton is weak, Shanghai cotton merchants are very firm in their thinking, mainly because their inventory is not large. Recently, trading among brokers in the market has been very lively, and the market is thriving. A total of 2,600 bales and 1,500 bags were transacted throughout the day, with prices continuing to rise by two or three yuan. Today, 155 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong. The current market prices for cotton are recorded below:

Brazilian Cotton 388, Shenxin No. 2 Factory: 100 bales sent to the factory

American Peeler 310: 100 bales also

Middling 410, Xinsheng: 200 bales also

Fire Machine Grass Bag 209, Hongzhang: 1,100 bags also

Brazilian Cotton 380, Tongfeng: 200 bales also

Middling 390, Zengfeng: 100 bales also

Also 396, Dachang: 200 bales also

Also 396, Shunfeng: 200 bales also

Also 399, Xietongxing: 100 bales also

Also: 200 bales also

White Locke 257, Shunfeng: 100 bales also

Also 264, Hengtai: 100 bales also

Also 262, Changxing: 400 bales also

Dhurilla 245, Zhongye: 100 bales also

Indian Cotton 209, Shunfeng: 200 bales also

Also 34, Shenghe: 200 bales also

In other news, the trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is very active because of the perilous situation in the Pacific and the optimism of fellow merchants. At the same time, factories are also in urgent need of goods due to the booming yarn market. In recent days, both brokers and factories have had large transactions, and the market trend is quite firm. The market price of Brazilian cotton per picul has exceeded 370 yuan, and the high-grade Peeler from India is also approaching 300 yuan.

The New York cotton market is weak due to the reluctance of buyers to enter the market. At the same time, it has fallen due to the weakness of Wall Street stocks and the selling by spot traders. As a result, closing prices were eight to fifteen points lower than the previous day, depending on the grade.

Also, Washington, 15th - The Bureau of Statistics released the March statistics for the American cotton industry as follows (bales in thousands, spindles in thousands):

Category | March This Year | March Last Year
------- | -------- | --------
Cotton Consumption | 854 | 626
Linters Consumption | 29 | 88
Cotton Exports | 97 | 434
Cotton Inventory at Factories | 1,911 | 1,96
Cotton Inventory at Warehouses | 13,244 | 2,404
Active Spindles | 13,796 | 13,555

The Indian cotton market is also weak, with closing prices falling by about three rupees each. It is also predicted that the market will continue to decline by one rupee at the opening today.

### Piece Goods: Factory Supply Is Weak

The piece goods market continued to be firm yesterday, because the factory supply was weak, and the demand from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and the Nanyang groups was still strong. Brokers and speculators absorbed cheaper goods, but some who had profited from floating orders resold them, so the selling prices were mixed. As a result, white coarse cloth rose by 2.5 jiao per piece, while fine cloth, twill, and plain cloth partially fell back by 1-2 jiao. Bleached and dyed cloth also had a mixed price range of 2.5 jiao. Nanyang brokers bought over 200 pieces of colored cloth and coarse cloth, while Guangdong and Hong Kong brokers bought over 300 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, serge, and broadcloth. Zhejiang and Ningbo brokers bought nearly 100 pieces of coarse and fine cloth and colored cloth. Over 700 pieces of various cloths were transacted on this street. Today, 1,855 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong and 80 pieces to Singapore.

The market for Dongbu cloth is tight and stable, with white fine cloth at 51.89 yuan, and fine twill continuing to be in short supply. High-end Longtou cloth rose to 45.65 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge closed at 1.5575 yuan in the afternoon.

### Yellow Drill Cloth Is a Short Play

As early summer approaches, yellow drill cloth is selling well and has good prospects. The selling price is extremely high. The actual price of Ship Brand yellow drill cloth has jumped to 2.5 yuan across the board. Tianxiang Dadesheng is 4.65 yuan, Jardine Matheson Woodpecker is 2.25 yuan, Dafeng Yipin is 2.4 yuan, Seven Sons Celebrate the Lantern Festival is 2.2 yuan, Japanese Factory Boy Scout Brand is 2.05 yuan, Elephant Deer Brand is 2.3 yuan, and there are many empty orders where there are only quotes but no actual goods. It is difficult to find in bulk, only in small quantities.

### Silk and Tea: Dragon Well New Tea on the Market

A large amount of new Dragon Well green tea from Hangzhou has been on the market in recent days. The opening price for high-mountain tea from the Lion Peak is 1,400 yuan per picul, and the selling price for second-grade tea also requires 1,100-1,200 yuan. The opening price is more than double that of last year. This new tea, through the hands of retailers, is being brought to Shanghai for sale. There are currently no bulk shipments arriving yet.

### Metals: Local Nails Are Slow and Prices Are Weak

In recent days, the market for local factory-made round nails has become soft due to the vigorous production from factories and occasional releases from speculators. Upon investigation, the actual sales have been limited due to the complete cessation of overseas routes and the limited sales on this street. Moreover, the construction industry has not been thriving, so daily trading has become even quieter, and the number of transactions throughout the day is very small. Currently, speculators have a large number of goods that they want to release opportunistically, but as people become bearish, the standards are gradually becoming unsustainable. Yesterday, each keg of Bessemer steel was 180 yuan.

### Coal: Tongdeli Coal Hoards and Refuses to Sell

The Tongdeli white coal market has been very active recently, not diminishing due to the hot weather. This is because the goods are entirely supplied to taverns, restaurants, and stoves, and are not only used for winter stoves. Although a certain company has had over 10,000 tons of new goods shipped in last month, they are using the excuse of fulfilling old orders to stop current sales. Even regular customers who usually buy half a ton or two baskets of coal for cooking are being refused. When asked why they are not selling with so much coal in storage, they are ignored. Such unscrupulous merchants are rare. It is understandable to raise prices when there is no coal, but refusing to sell when there is coal has caused fellow merchants to secretly bid 440 yuan. If they continue to hoard and not release, the market will continue to rise, and the future is worrying.

### Changing from Monthly to Installment Salary Payments (Continued)

— Zheng Shixian

Prices are rising steadily, and expenses are increasing step by step. A salary-earning family of four must have at least 100 yuan per month in expenses to barely cope. When the amount is large, it is difficult to manage. Now, for the average salaried person, if the salary date is in the first half of the month, it is easier to manage during this half-month; but in the second half of the month, the financial situation is often difficult to manage and allocate. Moreover, human nature is often like this: when receiving a salary, because there is more money on hand, spending often exceeds the budget easily, and those who do not know how to restrain themselves may even indulge in temporary extravagance. However, a month has a long thirty days. Therefore, ten to fifteen days after receiving a salary, one often falls into the plight of being economically disconnected (this month's income is exhausted, and next month's salary is yet to arrive). Moreover, with prices rising recently, most people, in order to avoid suffering greater losses, often buy as many urgently needed daily necessities as possible. In this way, even those with relatively large incomes or those who spend thriftily often find themselves counting the days and looking forward to payday. Therefore, from the perspective of employees, there is a need to improve the monthly salary payment system.

From the perspective of factories, stores, and firms, when it comes to payday, they must prepare a considerable sum of several thousand or even tens of thousands of yuan one or two days before payday, which is not uncommon. Many factories, stores, and firms must send specialists to the bank to withdraw large sums of cash for distribution during payday. In these difficult times, with thieves everywhere, the withdrawal and transportation of large sums of cash involves some risks. In the past, we have seen news in the newspapers of a large factory sending people by car to the bank to withdraw a large sum of cash the day before payday, only to be robbed by bandits on the way. Therefore, from the perspective of factories and stores, in order to reduce risks, it is indeed possible to change the monthly salary payment system. Moreover, it would be beneficial for employees to manage and turn over their finances, which would be a win-win situation, so why not do it?

My idea is that all factories, stores, and firms that follow the monthly salary payment system (as far as I know, a small number of large factories and stores in Shanghai have already changed to paying salaries twice a month) can, from now on, change to making payments in installments. As for the payment dates and frequencies, they can be determined at the discretion of each company, depending on its circumstances. I believe that for factories, stores, and firms that work every day of the month, those that previously paid monthly can now change to paying in two installments (the salary amount remains the same). For example, on the 1st and 16th of each month, or the 15th and the end of the month. As for new-style factories, stores, and firms that are closed on Sundays, they can issue payments once a week. For example, specify Saturday. Regarding this method, I think employees of general foreign companies and firms can demand that it be implemented first. This is because foreign companies originally practiced a weekly salary system in their own countries. When they came to China, they changed to following Chinese customs and adopted the monthly salary system. Under today's circumstances, in order to adapt to the actual situation and needs, the salary amount may still be calculated on a monthly basis, but the payment can be requested to be made in installments. This kind of reform will not harm the employers (at most, there will be more bookkeeping procedures); it will benefit the employees. All factories, stores, and firms, why not start doing it!

Editor's note: Dividing the monthly salary into installments provides convenience in the use of funds for the labor side; for the capital side, there seems to be a slight loss in interest, but it can avoid employees borrowing salaries in advance and reduce outstanding debts; however, opponents may be the accountants, who think that "one job is done several times," adding many procedures, and they may inevitably have some resentment in their hearts, but a reasonable and conscientious accountant will never think that way. Within the scope of his duties, he cannot care about the amount of work, so installment salary payment is simply not a problem. (End)

### Economic Miscellany

— Feng Liutang

Business Methods in the Pre-Qin Era

There is an ancient saying: "The world is bustling, all for profit; the world is clamoring, all for profit." If those who are bustling and clamoring are all for profit, then where does profit come from?

The Great Learning says: "There is a great principle for producing wealth. Let there be many producers, few consumers, diligent workers, and careful spenders, then wealth will always be sufficient."

The so-called "producing" and "working" both refer to production. "Producing" refers to the production of natural objects, such as agricultural and livestock production. "Working" refers to man-made production, such as handicrafts. The meaning of "consuming" is consumption, but it seems to refer specifically to those who do not produce but live off others. "Spending" refers to the use of wealth. If there are many producers, few consumers, quick manufacturing, and slow spending, then production exceeds consumption, and wealth is always sufficient. However, sufficient wealth is not the ultimate goal, so it is said:

"The benevolent use wealth to cultivate themselves, while the unbenevolent use themselves to cultivate wealth."

The so-called "the benevolent use wealth to cultivate themselves" means that the benevolent are able to use their wealth well and distribute it to the people, so they can start a family with wealth. This is because production requires mass consumption. The unbenevolent only know how to make personal wealth their business, so they lose themselves in order to accumulate goods, which is manipulation and hoarding.

China has never lacked economic thought. Guan Zhong was a great economic thinker and also a great financier. Later, there were Sang Hongyang in the Han Dynasty, Liu Yan in the Tang Dynasty, and Wang Anshi in the Song Dynasty, all of whom made some achievements in finance, industry, and commerce. Moreover, their theories and facts, when sought in modern times, were nothing less than the precursors of barter and controlled economy. I have often read the intellectual history of 19th-century Europe, which says that although China has thousands of years of culture, it only occupies a few pages of this book, saying that Chinese culture and thought have made no progress and have not contributed much to the world. I am ashamed of it, I am very ashamed of it, but I have no way to wash away the humiliation. But if Guan Zhong's learning is not obscured by later pedantic scholars, I know that Chinese economic theories must also be brilliant and well-organized, and be valued by the world long ago. It is a pity that no one has yet elucidated them. (To be continued)

### Taxpaying Foreigners to Hold Two Important Meetings This Afternoon to Discuss Organizational Changes and Additional Tax Proposals. It Is Expected that All Proposals Will Be Smoothly Resolved. The Chinese Side Accepts the Temporary Solution.

The annual general meeting of taxpaying foreigners this year, led by Consul General Hill, was originally scheduled to be held on April 2nd and 3rd, and to handle the change of directors for the 1941-1942 term. Later, due to the issue of the number of directors in the Municipal Council being changed, which could not be resolved for a time, it was repeatedly announced to be postponed. It was rescheduled to be held at the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road at 2:30 this afternoon. However, in order to empower the Municipal Council's Directors, Directors Okamoto, based on an agreement established by the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, proposed changing the organization of the Municipal Council and requested taxpayers to authorize the current board of directors of the Municipal Council to continue to handle the administration of the Public Concession (the original text of the proposal can be found in various Japanese newspapers). Therefore, before convening the annual general meeting, a special meeting was held first to pass the proposal. As for the important proposals of the annual general meeting, the most noteworthy is the sixth proposal: the Municipal Council requests taxpayers to authorize the council to levy or supplement various taxes and fees and to raise temporary funds of 9 million yuan. Therefore, the two major meetings today that are worth noting are: first, to decide on the reorganization of the Municipal Council starting today; second, if the sixth proposal is passed, the citizens will bear a much heavier burden in the future.

The Chairman Will Have an Important Report

The agenda for the special meeting and the annual general meeting was announced by the Municipal Council the night before last and published in the newspapers yesterday morning. There were no changes today. However, the Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday requesting those who wish to deliver speeches at the special meeting and the annual general meeting to stand on a specially designated platform in the venue to facilitate the audience and for recording. The Chairman of the Municipal Council, Kees van der Wijk, will deliver a speech when proposals six and seven are discussed. The content will include: 1. Reporting on the progress of handling the issues of western Shanghai, the northern district, funding, and the problems of beggars and refugees, hoping to fulfill the "Western District Police Rights Agreement," fundamentally improving the current situation in the district, and expressing condemnation for the stalled negotiations on police rights in the northern district, which have failed to take steps to restore the old situation. 2. Reporting on the financial situation of the previous year. 3. Reporting on the budget for this year (the full text can be found in another article, "Report on the Administrative Overview by the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Kees van der Wijk").

Meetings Should Proceed Smoothly

Startled by the incident on January 22nd, when the president of the Japanese Residents Association, Hayashi Yuji, shot the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Kees van der Wijk, during a special meeting to discuss additional tax proposals, the thoroughness of the arrangements inside and outside the venue today and the strictness of the security are likely to be the same as the situation when the special meeting was reconvened on February 5th, which does not need to be repeated. According to the previous regulations of the Municipal Council, in accordance with the rules of procedure for the meeting, anyone who has amendments to the proposals announced by the Municipal Council must notify the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Philip Felling, by 4:00 PM on April 9th. Anyone who has inquiries about the proposals must notify Mr. Felling in writing at least 24 hours before the meeting. According to investigations by reporters from the Dazhong News Agency, as of last night, no taxpayers had submitted amendments or raised questions. Therefore, today's meeting should proceed smoothly and without disputes. Furthermore, it is expected that in the near future, negotiations on restoring the northern district to its normal state will continue. The fact that Chairman Kees van der Wijk raised this issue in his report is seen by all parties as a prelude to negotiations.

The Chinese Side Accepts the Temporary Solution

Regarding the Municipal Council's proposal to change the organization and establish a temporary board of directors to exercise powers, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Kees van der Wijk, in addition to submitting the proposal for discussion at the special meeting held today, officially informed the Chinese Taxpayers Association. It is learned that the chairman and vice-chairman of the association, Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jigu, have sent a reply to the Municipal Council. The telegram reads: "To the Chairman of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, the Chinese directors attending your council for the years 1941 to 1942 have been legally elected by the representatives of the Chinese Taxpayers Congress as Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, and Chen Tingrui. According to the current Land Regulations, the number of seats for these candidates shall not be changed. However, in order to adapt to the environment and to express sincere cooperation with the Western taxpayers, the five Chinese directors of this term are willing to temporarily recommend Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, and Chen Tingrui to attend. This is a temporary measure. Respectfully reported by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, and Xu Jigu, Vice Chairman." It is heard that Guo Shun and Chen Tingrui, who were nominated as the next Chinese directors, have gone to Hong Kong for business and will return to Shanghai soon.

Foreigners Observe the Candidate Issue

According to a certain foreign authority observer, judging from the current situation, all the proposals submitted by the authorities to the congress are expected to be passed smoothly. The list of candidates for the temporary board of directors announced by the Municipal Council on the evening of the 10th has been considered by public opinion in various quarters in recent days as being unobjectionable, and it is certain that no one will oppose it at the special congress today.

Rumor: Liddell Will Be the Chairman

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that, according to reliable Japanese sources today (the 16th), after the taxpaying foreigners' special meeting tomorrow (the 17th), the British candidate for the Municipal Council, Liddell, will be elected as the next Chairman of the Municipal Council. The current Japanese director and former Japanese Consul General in Singapore, Okamoto, will be elected as the Vice Chairman. Mr. Liddell served as a director of the Municipal Council several years ago and is currently the General Manager of the British firm Peace and Co. He was wounded in the arm when the special meeting of taxpaying foreigners convened by the Municipal Council on January 23rd was shot. The Japanese side believes that in the event that Mr. Liddell leaves Shanghai for business or is unable to attend meetings due to health reasons or other reasons, Okamoto will serve as the acting Chairman of the Municipal Council, and the appointment of a Japanese person as the leader of the Municipal Council will be a historical first in the Public Concession. Even the appointment of Okamoto as the Vice Chairman is unprecedented. According to the Japanese side's statement this morning, they are satisfied with the reorganization of the Municipal Council and expect that a foundation for greater understanding will be established in the future.

### Roman Roll Ship Detained

The Roman Roll ship Kang Zhenji, represented by the Italian company Zilli & Co. (formerly known as Beiyang), was loading cargo at the French Concession Observatory Wharf at 5:00 PM on the 15th of this month, intending to sail to Changyinsha. Unexpectedly, while it was loading cargo, it was suddenly detained by Japanese military police. The cargo listed on the ship's manifest included 403 pieces of goods, including 150 bags of sugar, 172 pieces of yarn, 21 pieces of cloth, and 60 boxes of soap, with a value of over 500,000 yuan. It is heard that the ship's director, Kang Zhenji, is communicating with the naval forces, and it is expected that all of the cargo will be released within days.

### Joint Preparations in the Two Concessions Next Month

The eventful month of May is approaching in the blink of an eye, and various commemorative festivals are about to arrive. According to reports from the Daguang News Agency, various circles in the city will commemorate them solemnly. The Public Concession Municipal Council and the French Concession Municipal Council, through the police authorities, believe that due to the recent labor disputes and continuous labor unrest in the concessions, and given the extraordinary period and the special environment of Shanghai, there is a deep fear that someone will take the opportunity to cause disturbances and obstruct public order. Therefore, they are currently discussing methods and preparing to take joint precautions starting next month. Additional detectives will be dispatched to patrol, and search operations will be strengthened. In the event of important commemorative festivals, emergency measures will be implemented to ensure the peace and tranquility of the concessions.

### Perpetrators of the Destruction of Maochang Company Have Been Prosecuted

Workers in the city's eyewear industry went on strike due to demands for higher wages. The employees of Maochang Optical Company, located at 775 Yunnan Road, Nanjing Road, did not join the strike. At 3:20 PM the day before yesterday, a large number of eyewear workers went to Maochang, ordered them to join the strike, but failed. They then smashed the storefront glass and other items of the company, causing losses worth approximately 15,000 yuan. At that time, the old patrol station detective Xu Wenbin and Chinese and Western constables arrived at the scene to suppress the incident and arrested the perpetrators Gu Lijun, Zhao Ziming, Huang Jiaxiang, Xu Changrong, Yang Mingzhe, Wang Changlin, Dai Longgen, Xu Defu, Wang Weixiang, Wang Shanxiang, Wang Zhilin, Qu Quansheng, Huo Jinyuan, Jiang Xixing, Cai Arong, Gu Amao, Wang Jinlin, Dong Xingbin, and Zhu Yangsheng, a total of 19 people. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special Court. The patrol station's lawyer, Fang Fushu, prosecuted them for obstructing freedom and causing damage, requesting a postponement. After questioning by Judge Zhan, he ordered a postponement for further interrogation. It is learned that a portion of the eyewear case has been agreed to provide workers with a monthly rice subsidy of 30 yuan, so they have resumed work in succession.

### Bishop Ward to Lecture This Afternoon

This week's regular meeting of the Rotary Club of Shanghai will be held this afternoon in the gymnasium of the YMCA, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Upon investigation, the speaker has now been changed to Bishop Ralph Ward, a resident missionary in China. Bishop Ward has traveled extensively throughout the Americas in the past three or four years and has gained a great deal. The lecture program is sure to add interest. Due to the strike of workers at the Capital Hotel, the meeting place has been changed. Please note this, all members. For other details, you can call (16450) for inquiries.

### The Cathay Hotel Labor Dispute Is Expected to Be Negotiated

The management of the Cathay Hotel in this port has denied the rumors that the striking workers of the various hotels under its jurisdiction will be dismissed. It is heard that the management of the Cathay Hotel hopes that labor and management can soon conduct negotiations. Before the negotiations are concluded, no action is intended to be taken.

### The Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps Stationed in Shanghai Will Hold a Review This Morning

The Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps in this port will hold a review at the Racecourse at 9:00 AM today (the 17th). At that time, Colonel Baker will present medals to those with excellent shooting scores, and Lieutenant Colonel Cotes will serve as the commander.

### Rice Prices Are Rising Higher and Higher, Empty Talk of Suppression Is Ineffective, Speculators Are Again Engaging in Private Transactions This Afternoon

Yesterday, under the circumstances of rampant rumors by speculators, the price of rice continued to be raised by as much as three yuan per picul. After illegal elements privately made transactions again in the afternoon, it continued to be raised by about one yuan, resulting in a sharp increase of nine yuan per picul of rice in the last three days, setting a record for rice price increases. At a time when labor unrest is surging in various industries, and the current rice price is continuously rising in this way, social security is particularly worrying.

Rampant Rumors

The main reason for the rise in rice prices is the influence of rumors. After the rumors of Japan and the Soviet Union signing a treaty and Japan's imminent advance to the south subsided, yesterday rumors of Thailand's ban on exports and rising prices in the production areas were repeatedly spread in the market, causing general rice weevils to rejoice and hoarders to regard their goods as rare. It was also rumored that someone was searching for spot goods, causing rice prices to rise higher and higher. According to Thailand, it has only recently stipulated that exports of rice be subject to control, not prohibited. Moreover, the quantity imported from Thailand in Shanghai in March was only over 1,000 tons, accounting for a very small amount. This excuse is unreasonable.

Remedial Measures

Since the dissolution of the Rice Price Evaluation Committee, various rice industry organizations have also adopted a bystander attitude towards secret envoys in turn. Furthermore, because the enforcement and investigation methods of the authorities in the two concessions have not been announced for a long time, speculators are disregarding the law and manipulating market prices, further plunging the livelihoods of citizens into distress. The current situation in Shanghai has not yet reached its most serious stage, but this phenomenon already exists. If the situation evolves to a serious stage, it will be even more unimaginable. In order to avoid perishing together, rice industry organizations should cooperate with the authorities in the two concessions. The rules of operation for the rice market have been as good as waste paper since speculators became rampant in the market. Now, rice industry organizations should reissue the announcement and implement it immediately. In particular, the two points of requiring a deposit before a transaction is concluded, clearing the fixed goods within five days after the transaction is concluded, and stipulating that customers must sell to brokers and brokers must sell to rice shops, can eliminate the so-called "kicking the ball" operation in the market.

Foreign Newspaper Observations

According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, rice prices in Shanghai rose to a new height yesterday (the 16th). The selling price of No. 1 Saigon rice was as high as 123 yuan per picul, while the prices of other grades of rice also rose. According to a certain leader of Chinese rice merchants to reporters today, the high price of rice today should be attributed to the activities of general speculators. The rice merchant said that a large number of foreign rice had arrived in Shanghai in the last 24 hours. On Monday alone, the Panamanian cargo ship Ningmengna carried 45,400 bags of Saigon rice. Well-informed Chinese parties believe that the Municipal Council will soon take effective measures to force hoarders in this port to sell their stocks in order to alleviate the current tense situation. However, the details of this measure are still unavailable.

### Under the False Name of the "Ping Ming Society," Distributing Pamphlets; The Society Has Reported the Case to the Police for Thorough Investigation

The Ping Ming News Agency, established for just over a year, has been valued by society for its factual and unbiased reporting. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the agency received a returned letter bearing the agency's name and a matching address, addressed to the Shanghai Shilin Dyeing and Weaving Guild. Upon opening it, it contained a pamphlet published by the China Book Company in February of the 24th year of the Republic. The agency stated that it had never engaged in such activity. Regardless of the pamphlet's content, they did not wish to take credit for another's work. Based on this situation, they reported the matter to the police for a thorough investigation to prevent similar incidents from occurring again.

### Plague Still Present in Qu County

Of the plague outbreaks in various parts of Eastern Zhejiang, only Qu County continues to experience deaths. From the 27th to the 31st of last month, seven people died from the plague. Another four were infected and are currently receiving treatment, but their chances of survival are slim. In addition, over twenty family members of the patients have been quarantined. The epidemic prevention area is actively conducting various tasks, including investigation and statistics, sealing off the plague area, testing and research, environmental sanitation, preventive injections, and disinfection.

### Application Deadline for Postal Carrier Examination

Since the Shanghai Postal Administration began recruiting postal carriers, the number of applicants has been extremely enthusiastic. As of the day before yesterday, it had reached 1,400. The application process closed yesterday (the 16th), and the review of applications has begun. The qualifications for this examination require at least junior high school education or short-term elementary school education. After screening, applicants will be notified of the schedule for written and oral examinations. Those who pass will be hired as vacancies become available, with a monthly salary of thirteen yuan, plus allowances, totaling about 150 yuan.

### Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Cornabe, Reports on Administrative Overview (Part 1): Speech to Be Delivered Today at the Foreign Ratepayers' Meeting

This year's Foreign Ratepayers' Annual Meeting is scheduled to be held at the public viewing platform of the Race Club this afternoon (the 17th) (immediately following the special meeting). The agenda was released yesterday. Mr. Cornabe, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, will deliver a speech when discussing items 6 and 7 on the agenda. The gist of his speech is as follows:

### General Administration Item 6

As the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, my tenure has swiftly passed a year. As part of my responsibilities, I must present item 6 on the agenda, requesting the approval of the accounts and reports up to the end of last year. I recall that at last year's Ratepayers' Annual Meeting, the former Chairman, Mr. Fessenden, mentioned four main issues: the Western District problem, the Northern District problem, the economic problem, and the problem of beggars and refugees. What I wish to discuss today also pertains to these four issues, as their importance remains virtually unchanged from a year ago.

Negotiations of the Western District Agreement

On February 1st of this year, the organizational regulations for the Shanghai Western District Special Police Headquarters were formally signed. The Special Police Headquarters began operations on March 15th. Negotiations regarding the jurisdictional dispute over roads outside the Settlement had been underway for at least nine years. The outgoing Board of Directors can feel some satisfaction in finalizing the detailed regulations. It is hoped that the establishment of these detailed regulations will resolve all jurisdictional disputes in the area. The prevalence of crime in the area is well-known worldwide. It is believed that the establishment of the Special Police Force will bring about rapid and fundamental improvements in the area. However, at this time, we should exercise considerable patience. I believe that all of us are willing to sympathize with the Special Police Force's arduous work.

Northern District Problem Unresolved

Regarding the Northern District problem, due to political reasons, negotiations to restore our police jurisdiction have been unsuccessful in the past year. No steps have been taken to restore the franchise rights of the two public transportation utilities in the area. I regret this.

Chartering Vessels to Transport Grain

The problem of food and essential daily necessities is even more severe than in previous years. Over the past year, the cost of living and prices have risen frequently. The worrying rise in rice prices is self-evident and requires no further elaboration. The Council recently appointed two directors to join the Food Committee to study the grain problem and advise the Council on what steps to take to improve the rice market. As a result, the Council, based on their recommendations, established a small sub-committee to charter vessels to transport rice from Rangoon to Shanghai for price adjustment. The Council does not intend to interfere with normal business operations. However, the plan is to entrust the chartered vessels to reliable grain import merchants, with the freight charged only covering the charter fees and other unexpected expenses. Furthermore, the vacant space on these chartered vessels must be reserved for transporting cheaper rice. Once this rice arrives in Shanghai, it can only be sold to rice shops that are members of the Shanghai Rice Dealers' Association for resale. It is believed that once this port has a normal and sufficient supply of rice, a fair selling price will be established for normal rice.

Fuel Shortage Restricts Electricity

Due to the fuel shortage, it is necessary to restrict electricity supply from time to time. The Shanghai Electric Power Company is making every effort to obtain vessels to transport coal to Shanghai. The Council will do everything possible to assist them.

Reception of Beggars Completed

The beggar reception center mentioned by my predecessor last year has been established with the assistance of the Rotary Club of Shanghai and is now managed by the Salvation Army. The reception center currently houses 1,405 beggars. The enthusiastic service of these two organizations is admirable. (To be continued)

### Riot Erupts at Ewo Cotton Mill in Yangshupu: Police Open Fire on Orders, Wounding Two; Workers Injure Twelve Police Officers and Detectives

At approximately 7:30 AM yesterday morning, about fifty dockworkers employed by the Ewo Cotton Mill on Wetmore Road in Yangshupu, each wielding iron bars, rioted. Upon receiving the report, the Yulin Road Police Station dispatched officers to suppress the riot. Not only were they unable to disperse the dockworkers, but they were also attacked. They were forced to open fire, wounding two dockworkers.

Twelve Police Officers Injured

Twelve police officers were also injured, including five Western officers, two Japanese officers, and five Indian constables. All were sent to the hospital for treatment. Among the Western officers, Patrol Sergeant Fannon was the most seriously injured and is currently hospitalized at the Country Hospital. The other four were Detective Gilbert, Officers Basco and Abbott, and Acting Officer Stanberg, who sustained minor injuries. The incident unfolded as follows:

Workers Threaten to Strike with Guns

These dockworkers had been on strike for two days. This morning, each wielding iron bars, they attacked three Indian constables stationed in front of the Ewo Cotton Mill and rushed into the factory. The Yulin Road Police Station was then notified. Officers from the police station and reserves rushed to the scene. However, the dockworkers remained in the factory.

Forcibly Expelled; Ordered to Open Fire

The police then used force to expel them, resulting in a melee. Police officers were ordered to open fire, wounding two strikers. Another twenty were injured by police batons. Several Japanese military police officers also arrived on the scene, but seeing that the police did not need their assistance, they left. The police then arrested more than twenty of the rioters, and the riot was quelled. According to Ewo Cotton Mill personnel:

Labor-Management Negotiations Have Been Ongoing for Days

The riot originated on Sunday. On that day, the cargo workers announced a strike upon arriving at the factory and sent representatives to negotiate with the factory management. By 8 PM on the 15th, the issue had not been resolved when the workers left the factory. At that time, the factory expressed its willingness to continue negotiations or resume work after the strike was resolved. However, the workers were dissatisfied, leading to the riot yesterday morning.

### Shanghai People

— Shen Tao

Kun Di, who returned from Southeast Asia, said, "The overseas Chinese there are a little afraid of Shanghai people because Shanghai people are good at exploiting opportunities, have a great talent for seizing business, and are excellent at being perfunctory..." I am also a Shanghai person who has just returned from Southeast Asia, and after returning, I myself feel that the Shanghai people here are so amazing!

Shanghai is now an "isolated island," but even as an "isolated island," its external transportation has never been completely cut off. If you have always lived in Shanghai, you will definitely not believe what the situation is like outside of Shanghai. There, foreigners cannot reside without a passport or residence permit, the purchase of daily necessities is subject to regulation, there are air defense drills today and census surveys tomorrow, and there is a national defense donation for riding in cars, and the situation requires advance government request for "export permits." In Shanghai, as long as you have money, no matter how you obtained it, you can have anything and do anything. This is truly a "paradise island" amidst the flames of war everywhere!

Foreign friends write to me asking me to tell them about the recent situation in Shanghai. I don't know where to begin, so I just say that Shanghai has more than four million people, with many cinemas, dance halls, hotels, restaurants, and various other places of entertainment. Currently, apart from a few major cities in the Americas, Shanghai is the most prosperous city! But I didn't tell them how many beggars there are in Shanghai, how many prostitutes, how many houses are not fit for "human" habitation, and how much unrest there is.

Shanghai is now a barren land like the Gobi Desert. It doesn't produce rice, nor does it produce wheat. There is no place to grow even the "zhenzhu rice" or sweet potato leaves that poor people eat. There are no coal mines or iron mines here, and no one raises livestock. But there are millions of "people" here - yellow, white, and black. Everyone lives here and yet lacks nothing. If you have money, or if you can borrow money, you can buy more goods and hoard them, and in a few days, you can be sure to make some money. Currently, if you have money elsewhere, you can't use it. Here, you can spend as much as you like. If you like wine, there is all kinds of fine wine here. If you like women, there are all kinds of women here. If you like...there is...That's why Shanghai people are desperately trying to make money. But Shanghai doesn't produce anything, so it can't exchange for money, so everyone can only be perfunctory with each other, defraud each other, and gamble. You try to get his money into your pocket, and he tries to get your money. Therefore, speculators speculate. If you have money, you can spend it as you please. If you don't have it, you become a beggar or a bandit. That's why Shanghai is so prosperous!

When I first arrived on this "isolated island" and saw so many [characters missing] and everyone seemed to be enemies, I was really afraid that I couldn't step into such a city. On public transportation, buying tickets at the theater, you have to rush and push ahead regardless of others. If you don't push, you'll never get on! I didn't want to push in other places, but now I can actually push. That's probably why I can still come back to live in this hometown.

In Chongqing, there was originally no habit of having small bills in restaurants, but when Shanghai people arrived, there were. In Kunming, many Yunnan people often beat Shanghai people. They said that it was because Shanghai people came to Kunming that prices soared. In the past few years, many Shanghai people came to Hanoi, Vietnam, and the Vietnamese there said that when Shanghai people come, the prices go up! They are really rich and don't care.

Shanghai people can spend money, so they need money. Therefore, they are better at exploiting opportunities and cheating than others. Sometimes they can't care about relationships. The overseas Chinese are afraid of them. This is probably because they have not been trained in this strange Shanghai!

### Shanghai's Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign: Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday; Spitting is Like a Bomb, Killing People Effortlessly; Urging Citizens to Work Together to Promote Tuberculosis Prevention

The opening ceremony of the Shanghai Second Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign was held at 2 PM yesterday afternoon at the Xinxin Company's New Capital Radio Station. Honorary presidents Wen Lanting and Xu, as well as both presidents, delivered opening speeches, elaborating on the importance of the anti-tuberculosis campaign in Shanghai. They hoped that all sectors would work together to increase public knowledge and awaken the importance of tuberculosis prevention among citizens. Major hospitals and enthusiastic doctors throughout the city began providing services to citizens yesterday, offering free X-ray examinations and sputum tests. The conference also compiled warning slogans, such as "Spitting is like a bomb, killing people effortlessly" and "To protect national health, we should eradicate the lung disease that kills people without blood or knives," which were handed over to enthusiastic cinemas for free screenings and posted in prominent locations to encourage public awareness.

### Five Hundred Students from the Relief Association Saved from Dropping Out of School: Cilian Refugee Children's Primary School Implements Overtime Teaching

The Cilian Refugee Children's Primary School on North Zhejiang Road, located within the Ciyuan Shelter, is run by the United Relief Association, a charitable organization. The school originally had a total of more than 550 students. After reorganization last summer, the faculty worked diligently and achieved considerable results. On March 31st of this year, 500 students from the Refugee Relief Association were transferred to the Ciyuan Shelter. The Cilian Association realized that these refugee children had been through hardship, but it would be inappropriate to let them drop out of school and become desolate. It was imperative to continue teaching them. However, the number was as high as 500. Not only were they without books and supplies, but their names and grades were also without any basis for checking. They had no choice but to number and register them at the shelter, and then, based on the shelter's roster, examine each refugee child one by one and assign them to grades. There were 57 students in the first grade, 134 in the second grade, 115 in the third grade, 73 in the fourth grade, 45 in the fifth grade, and 33 in the sixth grade, [character missing] divided into eight classes. They also added books and supplies and distributed teachers and courses. The families of the refugee children had been out of school for a long time, and they were extremely grateful to be able to implement teaching in the shortest possible time.

### Zhang Yangfeng Shot Dead: Bloodshed at Dahua Hospital Yesterday Morning

At 10:25 AM yesterday morning, four men, two wearing blue short shirts and trousers and two wearing black gowns, suddenly broke into the second floor of Dahua Hospital at No. 19 Shijian Road in the French Concession. One man stood guard by the stairs, pointing a gun, and monitored Mr. Li, the bodyguard hired by Zhang Yangfeng, a patient from Jiaxing in Room 11, who was chatting idly. The other three went straight into Room 11, approached the bed, and one of them drew a gun and fired at Zhang Yangfeng, who was lying on the bed. The bullet hit Zhang's right temple and entered his brain. Blood gushed out like a fountain, and he died instantly. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the three men left the room and went downstairs with the other man, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, the police received the news and immediately dispatched detectives to search and arrest them, but to no avail. They then transported the deceased to the coroner's office and investigated the details of the case. According to reports, Zhang Yangfeng, who was shot dead, was 32 years old, from Jiaxing, and lived at No. 73 Shencheng Lane, West Avenue Road in the French Concession. On the 16th of last month, at noon, Zhang was at home when a man wearing a black gown broke in and shot Zhang twice in the right leg. At that time, Zhang went to the Guangci Hospital for treatment, where doctors amputated his injured leg. Zhang was then transferred to Dahua Hospital at the end of last month. Unexpectedly, he was still assassinated.

### Navy Social Club's Equipment Transported Away: More Than Sixty Crates

The surveying instruments and other items belonging to the former Ministry of the Navy, stored in the Navy Social Club at No. 182 Lupan Road in the French Concession, totaling more than sixty crates, were completely moved away by trucks at 11:30 PM last night. It is said that they were transported to Hongkou.

### Ordering Coal Dust: Transactions Reach 50,000 Tons

According to sources in the coal industry, legitimate coal merchants in the city, in order to prepare for contingencies and increase their inventory, have been planning and ordering large quantities of foreign coal for shipment to Shanghai. Transactions have been concluded in succession, totaling approximately 50,000 tons. The majority of this coal consists of Hongji and Gubart coal dust. The consignees have chartered ships to expedite the shipment to Shanghai for adjustment.

### Public Bus Catches Fire: Five Passengers Injured

At 6:27 PM yesterday afternoon, a Route 10 public bus caught fire near Connaught Road and Gordon Road due to a sudden electrical malfunction. Black smoke filled the air, and the fire was intense. The fire was extinguished after the fire brigade dispatched vehicles to the scene. The public bus was severely damaged by the fire. At the time, there were many passengers on the bus, all scrambling to escape, resulting in five men and women being seriously injured. They were transported to Binlong Hospital for treatment by ambulance. The names of the injured are as follows: Li Shaofu, 34 years old, and Dai Benshan, 31 years old, both with burns to the face; Yang Shoucheng, 18 years old, with a fractured right foot; Zhang Asi, 20 years old, with an injured foot; and a woman, Guo Xia Shu, 23 years old, with an injured arm.

### Bloodshed at Zhongxing Villa Last Night: Zhang Xiaochong Shot Dead, Cao Shanqing's Life Hanging by a Thread

Over a hundred Zhongxing Bank employees live in the Zhongxing Villa at No. 96 Route Ghisi. Since being freed from detention some days ago, they are still living there. At about 9 PM last night, Cao Shanqing, the deputy head of the cashier section of the bank, and Zhang Liwei, the head of the Xinzha Road branch of the bank, went out together for some business. At 11 PM, four men accompanied the three back to their residence in a black-plated car. When the car arrived at the alley entrance, the four men ordered the three to get out of the car. As they walked into the dormitory, several gunshots were suddenly heard. Zhang Xiaochong and Cao Shanqing fell to the ground in response. Zhang Liwei avoided being hit because he dodged effectively. Afterwards, the "Special Police Headquarters" was alerted and immediately dispatched detectives to investigate. The shooter also escaped without a trace. Zhang Xiaochong was shot once in the head and once in the waist and fell to the pool of blood. He was already dead. Cao Shanqing was shot three times in the head and twice in the right hand and fell to the blood. He was struggling to live. An ambulance was quickly summoned to send both men to Tongren Second Hospital. Zhang Xiaochong could not be saved, and his body was transferred to the coroner's office. Cao Shanqing's injuries were severe, and his life was hanging by a thread.

### Japanese Man Drunk and Clashes with Foreigners: Gun Fired, Fortunately No One Injured

According to the North China Daily News, at about 12:40 PM today (the 16th), several Japanese men, all drunk, suddenly got into an argument with several foreigners in a cafe near Broadway Road. They even drew guns and fired two shots. The details at the time are not known. According to the police investigation, these Japanese men, after getting drunk, broke into the cafe and suddenly got into an argument with the foreigners for some unknown reason. The Japanese then drew their guns and fired two shots, fortunately without injuring anyone. It is not known whether the Japanese men who caused the incident were detained.

### Three Chinese Employees of a Japanese Trading Company Commit Suicide Together: Resort to Desperate Measures Due to Embezzlement of Company Funds

At about 6 AM yesterday morning, in Room 431 on the fourth floor of the Yangtze Hotel at No. 287 Yunnan Road, three young men suddenly locked themselves in a room and attempted to commit suicide by taking sleeping pills in a group. After the discovery, the police were notified, and an ambulance was quickly summoned to send them to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is understood that the three young men were named Wang Dechang, 20 years old, from Shanghai; Wu Yinxing, 21 years old, from Shaoxing; and Wan Shaogan, 20 years old, from Ningbo. All were employees of the Yagi Trading Company at No. 20 Guangdong Road. Because each of them was indebted and embezzled company funds totaling several hundred yuan, they could not make up for it and resorted to this desperate measure. Wu and Wan were unable to speak after being sent to the hospital, and their conditions were precarious. The police suspected that there might be other circumstances and are currently investigating.

### Employee of Uchiyama Bookstore Robbed of Large Sum of Money

On the morning of the day before yesterday, at about 9 AM, a case occurred on North Sichuan Road in which two bandits robbed a passerby of more than 9,000 yuan in Japanese currency. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the passerby who was robbed was Wang Ruidong (34 years old), an employee of the Uchiyama Bookstore on Shigaotai Road. That morning, he was carrying 9,900 yuan in Japanese currency belonging to the store, intending to deposit it at Sumitomo Bank. While riding in a rickshaw pulled by Shi Shanjie (35 years old) from Jiangbei, on North Sichuan Road in front of the First National Elementary School, two bandits suddenly blocked the road and robbed him of all the money before fleeing without a trace.

### Two Corpses Found on Tangshan Road and Yuanfang Road in Hongkou

### The City's Climate is Good: Mortality Rate Has Decreased Sharply

Since the beginning of spring, the climate has returned to normal, with warm and pleasant spring sunshine. The health of the residents has also improved. According to the Datong News Agency's inquiries with the health departments of the two concessions, the mortality rate among residents has decreased sharply in the past week. In the International Settlement, there were 776 Chinese deaths and 9 foreign deaths. In the French Concession, there were 174 Chinese deaths and 3 foreign deaths, totaling only 962 deaths. Compared with the previous weeks of more than a thousand deaths, this is a decrease of several hundred. However, as the weather warms, cholera and other epidemics will soon be active, so it is necessary to pay attention to prevention.

### Philanthropist Yu Baoqing's Funeral Scheduled

Yu Baoqing, a Shanghai gentleman, also known as Canxia Sanren, was the son of Mr. Pinghan. He was of a quiet temperament and loved to do good deeds. His early family education was very strict. His father wanted him to experience the ways of the world and, in addition to hiring teachers to teach him, made him an apprentice in a cotton cloth store so that he would know the difficulty of farming. He married the eldest daughter of Mr. Sun Shushi, the late chief writer of the Xinwenbao. Father-in-law and son-in-law got along well, and his studies greatly improved. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, he gathered like-minded comrades in the business community to create the Shangyu Academy, purchased weapons, and trained day and night, laying the foundation for the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in the future. He also formed the Mingshe Poetry Society with famous figures such as Sun Shushi and Wu [character missing]. Members came from all over the country and held monthly poetry gatherings, which have continued for thirty years without interruption. He established seven Puyi free schools, providing books and paper to poor students, benefiting tens of thousands of students over the years. When the August 13th Incident occurred, he remained calm about the businesses he founded. At that time, traffic in Shanghai was blocked, and the corpses in the rental coffins collected by Pushen Villa had no place to be buried. Mr. Yu readily agreed to use 100 acres of his private property on Hongqiao Road for their burial, without charging rent, until traffic in the suburbs resumed. He greatly assisted with sanitation in the concessions, and his courage to do good was remarkable. He was also proficient in Western languages and served as the Chinese manager of various foreign companies, such as Huajia Foreign Company and Haoshi Foreign Company. Before his death, he served as a director of Western charities such as Renji Hall, Pushen Villa, Guangyi Chinese Medicine Hospital, and Guoyi Civilian Hospital, as well as businesses in the industry such as the Huashang Electric Company. He lived to the age of 60. His family tomb is in Minhang, but due to the unrest of the times, it was not convenient to be buried there. Feng Bingnan wrote a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, listing his contributions to the local area. The authorities specially allowed him to be buried in the Shanghai Municipal Council Cemetery in Jing'an Temple, which was held on the 2nd of the month. It is now known that his family has scheduled a funeral on April 27th at the Gongdelin Restaurant. At that time, with plain carriages and white horses, it will be a grand occasion.

### The Yiji Charity Association Distributes Affordable Rice: White Rice Sold at One Dime Per Pound; Approximately One Million Pounds Sold Each Month

The Shanghai Yiji Charity Association has been running programs such as cloth distribution for more than twenty years. Recently, in view of the rising prices of rice and coal, which have caused great suffering to the common people, the association's directors, Huang Jinrong, Fan Huichun, and Fan Kaitai, raised funds on their own initiative to establish two porridge kitchens. Later, they changed to distributing affordable rice at seven locations. The first location is at Guandi Temple in Nanshi, the second is at the Deyilou Restaurant in the Chenghuang Temple in Nanshi, the third is inside the Huhu Charity Association on Youche Street in Nanshi, the first location in the northern city is inside the Caishen Temple at No. 22 Alley, Wuding Road in the International Settlement, the second location in the northern city is the Lower Courtyard of Yuhuang Mountain at the end of Seymour Road, the third location in the northern city is the Cotton Cloth Association at the intersection of Father Rho Road and Maran Road in the French Concession, and the fourth location in the northern city is the Pingdeng Hermitage at No. 124 Raulich Road in the French Concession. The association's affordable rice is sold at one dime per pound, which is the lowest price compared to ordinary affordable rice. Because the Shanghai Peace Association and the Kaiping Coal Mine Company strongly support it, they have agreed to supply the required coal and rice at affordable prices. It is also heard that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, recognizing that the association is running things seriously and that the common people are receiving real benefits, has voluntarily donated 100,000 yuan. The affordable rice is sold at the cost of flat rice and flat coal, and there is still a loss of five cents per pound. Approximately one million pounds are sold each month. The number of people benefiting can be imagined. However, the association has not solicited donations externally in the six months since it started. The financial resources are limited, and the previous funds are about to be exhausted. Raising additional funds is urgent. It is hoped that people of influence in all sectors and enthusiastic philanthropists will quickly rise to assist, either by organizing on their own or by providing assistance to the association. Reducing the suffering of the common people by one point will increase the peace of society by one point. Not only will the merits be boundless, but it can also help to support the precarious situation and overcome the difficulties together.

### Yunnan Education Department Vigorously Implements School Mergers and Class Cuts to Save Funds and Improve Education; Arts Teachers College Merged into Kunhua Normal School; Yuxi Junior Normal School and Agricultural School Merged into Yuxi High School

(Kunming Correspondent) The Education Department of Yunnan Province, in view of the social environment's instability, the fundamental shake-up of education funding, the uncertainty of faculty and students' whereabouts, the need for further improvement of teachers' lives, the necessary adjustments to school classes, and the urgent need for changes to the spring semester, has decided to implement school mergers and class cuts vigorously starting this year. This has been reported to the provincial government and ordered to be implemented in various schools. There are four cases of schools that have been specifically merged: First, the merger of the provincial Kunming Arts Normal School and Kunhua Normal School. The Arts Normal School was originally established to cultivate arts specialist teachers and has been established for many years, producing many talents. However, the establishment of a specialist school is particularly uneconomical, and its educational professional training should also be integrated with general normal schools. Now, with the normal school system, arts specialist teachers can be cultivated, and a specialized major can be set up in the normal school. There is no provision for independently setting up a specialist school. Since February of this year, the Arts Normal School has been merged into Kunhua Normal School. Students of the same year in the two schools have also been merged and assigned to classes for teaching, in order to enrich the number of students and save expenses. Second, the merger of the provincial Yuxi High School and the provincial Yuxi Junior Agricultural School and Simplified Rural Teachers School. Because there are now two provincial schools in Yuxi, it is particularly unnecessary and uneconomical. Moreover, the personnel of the provincial Yuxi High School have been replaced, and the newly appointed Principal Yang has resigned due to illness. Since February of this year, the provincial schools established in Yuxi have been merged into the provincial Yuxi High School. The original junior agricultural and simplified teacher classes have been changed to the junior agricultural science department and the simplified rural normal department of Yuxi Provincial High School. Students of the same grade in the three schools have also been integrated into classes. Third, the merger of the provincial Kunhua Elementary School and Kunming Experimental Elementary School. In order to implement national education, the provincial elementary schools will be adjusted. The provincial Kun Elementary School and the Experimental Elementary School will be merged into one school, named the Provincial Kunming Elementary School, which is affiliated to the Provincial Kunming Normal School for normal school students to practice. It has been reorganized and implemented since February of this year. Fourth, the affiliated middle schools of the provincial Kunhua Industrial School and Agricultural School have been merged into Yunrui Middle School and Fuchun Middle School respectively. The attached junior high schools of the industrial and agricultural schools were originally a temporary expedient. Now, in order to implement the establishment of vocational and middle school systems, the attached middle school of the industrial school will be merged into Yunrui Middle School, and the attached middle school of the agricultural school will be merged into Fuchun Middle School, in order to comply with the school system.

Academic Lecture

### How to Study Chemistry (1)

— Wu Ruinian

If we want to study chemistry, we must first understand what chemistry is. The name chemistry comes from the English word Chemistry, which in turn comes from the word Alchemy. The original meaning of this word is "alchemy," which is the method used by Western philosophers to study how to turn stone into gold, which is actually the same as the myth in our country about Lu Chunyang turning stone into gold. However, its initial scope was very narrow, only how to study turning stones into gold. Later, it gradually expanded and studied the possibility of transforming one substance into another, which became today's chemistry. Therefore, the current meaning of chemistry is a science that studies the changes between substances, the composition, properties, and manufacturing methods of various substances. In terms of its function, it is closely related to human life. From national defense, military affairs, and transportation to cooking, washing, and breathing, all are directly or indirectly related to chemistry.

(2) The Importance of Chemistry

From a chemical point of view, the history of mankind can be divided into three periods: the primitive period, the transformation period, and the creation period. During the primitive period, human beings only knew how to use substances made by nature, and their relationship with chemistry was very small. Later, human desires gradually increased, and the substances made by nature were not enough to satisfy their desires, so they had to find ways to transform them to suit their needs. Unknowingly, they were already under the control of chemistry. Today, we call it the creation period. Human culture has developed rapidly and is changing with each passing day, becoming a completely chemical world. For example, national defense in the past was mostly castles, but now it is minefields. Weapons in the past were mostly bows and arrows, but now they are poison gas and explosives. Transportation in the past mostly relied on water power and animal power, but now it is cars and airplanes. Industries in the past mostly belonged to natural products, but now they are mostly man-made. We live in this era of creation and transformation. If we do not have chemical knowledge to deal with it, what will be the result? I think we all know it. We often envy the wealth and strength of the United States and lament the poverty and weakness of our country. Is it because our country's area is not as large as the United States, its products are not as abundant as the United States, or its population is not as large as the United States? We all know that this is not the case. So what is the reason? You must know that although our country has a large land area, most of it does not produce, and although its products are abundant, most of them are not utilized, and although its population is large, most of them have no way to make a living. The only reason is the lack of chemical knowledge and skills to develop it. Therefore, the goal of our study of chemistry is to understand the evolution of past culture and the relationship between chemistry and national defense, industry, agriculture, medicine, hygiene, family, etc., in order to explain the changes in natural phenomena, provide us with applications in life, and strive for the happiness of the people and promote social progress. In recent decades, educators in our country have known the importance of chemistry, so it is listed as a compulsory subject in secondary education, and students are gradually becoming aware of their responsibilities and are gradually becoming interested in chemistry.

Science

### The Heroes of the Medical World

— Guo Hongdi

The progress of science and the advancement of the times are all due to the great figures who have a firm belief in the future of mankind, bury themselves in hard work, and are loyal to their duties.

Jesse Lazear, in order to prove that mosquitoes are the vector of yellow fever, volunteered to risk his life as a test subject, allowing mosquitoes carrying yellow fever germs to bite him; as a result, yellow fever in Central America and the United States found a radical cure.

The historical records of such heroic deeds of scientists are countless. A young man, for the sake of the future of all mankind, is willing to risk his personal life to save others; this kind of time is as deeply touching as the heroes who sacrificed their lives for the country on the battlefield.

It was reported the other day that Dr. John H. Crandon of Harvard University in the United States, in order to study scurvy, used himself as a test subject, eating only cheese, biscuits, and black coffee to make himself develop scurvy. As a result, he discovered that many symptoms that were originally thought to be scurvy were actually related to other diseases. This may not be a shocking event in medical history, but the reason why the scientific community is what it is today is due to the great figures who are loyal to their duties and who have made sacrifices little by little.

Education

### Impoverished Elementary School Teachers

— Xin Liang

It is really unexpected that elementary school teachers in the United States would also be as miserable as ours. According to statistics from the US Department of Education, during the 1939-1940 school year, the average salary for each elementary school teacher was only $1,380 per year. There were even some as low as $200! Even in the most prosperous state of New York, at least 5,000 elementary school teachers earn less than $1,000 a year. We note that these are annual salaries, not monthly salaries. One person who devoted himself to education for more than 30 years received only $3,000 in compensation - only enough to support him for a few months after retirement.

This kind of impoverished life has caused many young people to change their interests and aspirations. They are not happy to take on this profession, because in the same place, an engineer or salesperson earns much more than an elementary school teacher. Moreover, being an elementary school teacher can be said to have no security and no freedom. The school board can dismiss you at any time by finding some fault. What is even more ridiculous is that some school boards absolutely prohibit elementary school teachers from dancing, smoking, playing cards, or going out for fun on weekends. For female teachers, they also put forward conditions such as not allowing them to marry, not allowing them to wear short skirts, not allowing them to wear rouge, not allowing them to make boyfriends arbitrarily, and not allowing them to go out after 10:00 PM.

A man named Lawson recently interviewed 57 elementary school teachers. According to him, some of them frankly said that they did not feel any interest in this profession. Eleven said they had no reasonable freedom at all. Eighteen said they had no learning opportunities in this profession. Sixty-seven said they simply did not like teaching. There were as many as 21 people who said that if they could find another job, they would not like to teach again. There is some truth to the saying "complain about the profession you are in." If you ask them, about nine out of ten are willing to change careers.

But in fact, there are many people who love to teach. One young man said that he was willing to spend his whole life's energy and time on teaching, saying: "The hope of democratic politics and human progress lies in education." Several people also believed that teaching is the best service opportunity. Like the educator Horace Mann, they felt that a person should always make some contributions to mankind and put in some effort to be considered worthy of this life. Teachers have a great responsibility. They should pass on to the new generation the various concepts and values of forward-looking life and reasonable thinking. "If you want to create a glorious country, please first devote yourself to schools." Bismarck once said this. Let us always keep it in mind!

### Life That is Unbearable

Editor:

I am a loyal reader of the Shen Bao. In my besieged environment, only it - the Shen Bao - is my only companion. Especially in the small garden of Free Talk, I have come to know that the help you give people is so sincere and earnest. I am a person who has suffered the pain of marriage and has been rescued after a suicide attempt. I want to pour out the infinite pain hidden in my heart to you today, hoping that you will show me a bright path so that my weak life can be preserved. I will be grateful to you!

I am a 24-year-old woman who has received a high school education. In the year I turned 19, I got to know a man who was studying in middle school by chance. After a so-called "love" process, we blindly got married. After marriage, I lived with his parents, brothers and sisters - from then on, I became a "long-term prisoner" "living under someone else's roof". All I saw were selfish and mean behaviors and hypocritical smiling faces. It made me forget whether this was heaven or hell. Only then did I begin to realize how cruel human beings were in their primitive state.

He - my husband, after accepting his mother's day and night instigation, began to show his true colors. Moreover, because someone was helping him, he would hit me if we disagreed. Several times she discussed it behind my back, even gathered a crowd to commit violence, and even wanted to put me to death as an enemy. It is a pity that I struggled for three years in a situation where I could not bear it any longer. On a night when I was beaten, I took a large amount of poison and was finally rescued. Sir, speaking of this, I have to tell you an even more terrible situation. Perhaps you will not believe that there are people in the world who are more cruel than them. On the night I took poison, they deliberately delayed taking me to the hospital immediately. If there was not a family nearby at that time, I was afraid that I would have left this world that night. This is because they are too clever. They understand that "suicide" is not "being killed." After I die, they can still live a carefree life.

His mother is a typical 50-year-old woman of "Madam Liu", whose face is always full of smiles to me, but she is extremely cunning and treacherous. Abusing outsiders is her only skill. Our family's servants are her best slaves. She drives them day and night, still afraid that they will have some respite. "The most poisonous heart is a woman's heart." This sentence is symbolized in her.

I am a person who has suffered extreme pain in the world. My husband is just his mother's son and is no longer my person in spirit. When the pressure of life has crushed me to the point where I can't breathe, I still have to bear this spiritual trauma. It is really too pitiful!

I am still young, and I really don't know how to spend my future life? Looking in the mirror, I feel my cheeks gradually thinning, and many wrinkles have been added to my forehead out of thin air. I already look very old. Alas! Marriage killed me. I am afraid that death is already waiting for me, let me go back!

There must be many people in the world who suffer the same pain as me. I hope you will disclose this letter and let the sisters who have not yet married use it as a warning.

I am a person who is dying and waiting to be rescued. I hope that some sympathetic readers will show me a path to happiness and let me [omitted words]!

Finally, I wish you good health!

A Unfortunate Person

Ai Mei Respectfully

April 9th

Ms. Ai Mei:

After seeing your letter of blood and tears, I believe that the readers of Free Talk will all be filled with infinite anger and give you deep sympathy.

Undoubtedly, there are only two realistic paths in front of you: the first is to continue your "long-term prisoner" life of "living under someone else's roof" while eking out a living. We know that you are unwilling to bury your future in the pain of inhuman life; the other path is to jump out of the cage of that cruel family, find a suitable job, seek your own life, and stand up again to be a new person. (Divorce or not is another issue).

Judging from the writing in your letter, you should not find it difficult to find something to do. Regarding this matter, we hope that sympathetic readers will find a way to help. In addition, you can go to the Career Women's Department of the YMCA at the intersection of Moore Ming Road and Jing'an Temple Road to register. They will definitely be happy to help.

(6) Product of Love

"No, at least not as troubled as you are." Zhao Yukun's two lively eyes kept circling around his face. "Hey! Third brother, if there's anything on your mind, why not tell us all? Maybe this good-for-nothing brother of yours can even help you out!"

How could he voice such anxieties? Initially, Qiu Haitang absolutely didn't want to tell him, but Yukun's eloquence was always sharp, and after withstanding his persistent indirect inquiries, Qiu Haitang's heart began to stir. Furthermore, the brotherly affection they had shared for over a decade unconsciously urged him on. After more than ten minutes of hesitation, he finally stammered out the whole story of himself and Xiangqi.

"That's really refreshing!" Yukun even laughed out loud with excitement. "I didn't expect you to vent such anger for so many people who have been bullied by old Yuan..."

"Keep it down, will you? Old One." Qiu Haitang, hearing him shout so joyfully, panicked and hurriedly got up to close the door, repeatedly waving his hand at him.

Yukun, however, laughed even louder.

"Haha! Why are you suddenly so timid now? To be honest, if you hadn't told me yourself, I really wouldn't have believed it!" He leaned back with his legs raised high, looking at the ceiling, and said, "But this female student is really brave. Can you at least let me meet her sometime?"

Qiu Haitang could only give him a wry smile.

"You don't have to worry about the child!" Yukun's small body, once curled up, really looked like a cat lying on the bed. "As long as she first sweet-talks old Yuan, making it clear that she won't go to the hospital and won't give birth to a son, then your brother will have a solution!"

"What good would going to the hospital do?" Qiu Haitang asked, baffled.

Yukun didn't explain it to him, but repeatedly patted his own chest, saying:

"As long as she can get into the hospital, give me a signal three days beforehand, and I'll have the ability to bring back your own flesh and blood!"

### James Stewart Wins Best Actor Award

— Xin Juan

James Stewart had previously won a Golden Globe for his roles in "You Can't Take It With You" in 1938 and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" in 1939. This time, he won the Best Actor Golden Globe for "The Philadelphia Story" (starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, James Stewart, John Howard, etc.). He has talent, he is willing to work hard, so his selection this time is certainly not a fluke.

James Stewart was born on May 20, 1908, in Indiana, Pennsylvania. His father was a hardware merchant. He initially studied at a public school, then transferred to Mercersburg Academy. After graduating, he entered university to study mechanical engineering, but immediately changed his plans and aspirations and joined the New England Traveling Theater Company. Arriving in New York, he performed on Broadway with his classmate Henry Fonda, achieving great success and praise. He then entered the film industry in 1935, playing supporting roles in films such as "Navy Wife," "Rose-Marie," and "After the Thin Man," gradually showing his talent. It was not until the release of "Seventh Heaven," co-starring with Simone Simon, that he established his position on the silver screen. Since then, he has become a mainstay star at MGM. His works include "Son of Frankenstein," "Born to Dance," "Vivacious Lady," "You Can't Take It With You," "The Shop Around the Corner," "Destry Rides Again," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," and "The Philadelphia Story." His most recent work is the comedy "Come Live with Me" (co-starring Hedy Lamarr and Ian Hunter).

James Stewart's acting is calm, smooth, and delicate. He is skilled at playing naive, upright, and simple young men. He, along with Cesar Romero, is one of the most watched unmarried men in Hollywood by young women. Recently, he and Olivia de Havilland have been in love, and there is a strong possibility of a lifelong commitment. Although James Stewart has expressed his reasons for not wanting to marry, this is a matter of opportunity. We anticipate that in the near future, his marriage to Olivia de Havilland will become a reality.

He is six feet four inches tall, second only to "Long Son" Gary Cooper, has brown hair, and gray and intelligent eyes. He is good at flying planes and playing the accordion. He is very shy and hates writing letters. He is interested in the film industry and is very interested in every part of the microphone work, sound recording, editing work, and the screenwriting room. He registered for military service last year.

### On "Da Hua Gu" (Beating the Flower Drum)

— Qian Naijiang

The Peking Opera play "Da Hua Gu" originally incorporated revolutionary significance into the songs of flower drum girls during the Ming Dynasty, spreading throughout the countryside and becoming a latent force among the people, which helped Hongwu drive out the Yuan Tartars. The contribution was not small. However, what is now performed on stage has transformed the female flower drum hero into a disguised prostitute. The content of the script is even more absurd. This is because, under the oppression of autocratic tyranny, it has been maliciously slandered by counter-propaganda, giving the audience a bad impression (it is said that this play originally came from Yuan Dynasty plays). It is believed that there is no shortage of Peking Opera masters in Shanghai. Scripts with similar meanings should be reported more, which will help improve Peking Opera.

"Da Hua Gu" is a joking play. Wang Ba and Ugly Young Master belong to the Clown role. Zhou Xinfang and Zhao Ruquan once cross-dressed in charity performances and co-starred with Feng Zihe at the Carlton, achieving remarkable results. The protagonist, the Fengyang girl, belongs to the Hua Dan (young female) role. Female performers in the north and south, such as Hua Huilin, Yu Sulian, Xiao Linghong, Zhou Meiyan, etc., are all masters of this role. However, there are very few people in the Beijing school who are good at this role.

### "Hua Jian Lei" (Tears on Flowers) Takes Many Twists and Turns

— Tian Fang

The Internal Cast Has Almost Completely Changed

Because it grasps realistic themes and adds vivid writing by the playwright, "Hua Jian Lei" has been supported by a large number of audiences after its performance, especially dancers, who accept it with sympathy. When Jin Xing Film Company was founded, it was prepared to move this stage play to the screen and planned to invite all the dancers to perform, but it was abandoned due to difficulties during the preparation period.

Knowing that recently, because Wu Cun was going to the South Seas Islands, (Wu Cun was the director of "Hua Jian Lei" internally appointed by Jin Xing) it had to be filmed earlier. Fortunately, the background of "Hua Jian Lei" is in the summer, and now it is late spring and early summer, which is much more convenient in terms of clothing. At that time, the cast was set as Zhou Manhua's Mimi, Yuan Shaomei's Dingxiang, Yingzi's Gu Xiaomei, Chen Lu's Manli, Meng Na's Mimi's mother, Shu Shi's Xiao Li, Lü Yukun's Jin Shiyin, Xu Feng's Xiao Chen, and Xi Jiachang's Chang Haicai, etc. Although this cast list is not very ideal, it is neat enough.

However, Zhou Manhua first proposed that she could not spare time during the "New Beauty Trap" (produced by Guo Hua) and refused to perform. Now Jin Xing has telegraphed He Ping, who is studying in Suzhou, to take on the role. At the same time, Yingzi's Gu Xiaomei is also difficult to realize for a while, and Chen Qi will play the role instead. As for Chen Lu's Manli, the company has considered and changed to invite Murong Wan'er to play.

As for Lü Yukun's Jin Shiyin, according to news from Guanzi, there is also an invitation for Han Fei, who will play the male lead in "Ye Shen Chen," to make a cameo appearance. At the same time, Yuan Shaomei's Dingxiang will also be changed to Xia Xia. However, it is difficult to confirm for a while.

Really, under such circumstances, "Hua Jian Lei" is indeed taking many twists and turns, but Jin Xing's decision to film the project will never waver because of this.

### Brief News

The Film and Drama School is scheduled to hold a parent-teacher conference on the 16th and 17th, staging the play "People of Pleasure" and the three-act play "Modern Children" at the Ningbo Fellow Association, jointly performed by the fourth and fifth second-term students of the school, and inviting Shanghai film and drama circles and the press to visit.

The Luye Troupe is actively rushing to rehearse Xu Zhi's "Nightingale Song," which is scheduled to hold its fifth experimental performance at 10:00 am on April 20th at the Queen's Theater.

Chapter 6: Temporarily Intoxicated Beauty Beside the Zither

His escape was so peaceful that he used his own methods to treat the other person’s body. He thought that when Hong Niangzi woke up tomorrow, she would regret it. He returned to Qi County all the way and was comforted to see the beautiful scenery of his hometown and the intact city walls. He ran straight to his own village, jumped off his horse, and saw a villager standing outside the door. He was overjoyed to see Li Xin coming back, so he came over and shouted, and helped him hold the horse. Li Xin asked if his family was well? The villager replied, "They have returned from the city and are all well." Li Xin went inside and met his wife and everyone else. After the reunion, everyone was overjoyed. Offline did not want to reveal his feelings on the mountain, only saying that he suffered a lot in the bandit den after being captured, and he managed to escape. The family did not pursue the matter. The next day, Li Xin missed Xu Jing, so he ran to Xu Jing's house to visit. Who knew that Xu Jing's house was quiet and only Liu Sanyi was there watering the garden. Li Xin called him over to inquire, only to learn that since the last time the bandits attacked the city, Xu Jing's old mother was frightened. When she returned home, her illness worsened, and medicine was ineffective. She passed away in a few days. Xu Jing was very sad about this great misfortune, so he put his old mother in a high-quality coffin and buried her in the ancestral cemetery. Three days before Li Xin returned to the village, Xu Jing happened to leave home with his sword and rushed to Daizhou to join the army. The family entrusted it to Liu San to take care of. Li Xin felt no emotion after hearing this news, but had to return to the village. He thought that Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei had already left the customs to join the army, and now Xu Jing was also gone. A man should be like this in troubled times. How can he grow old and die here, silently and unknown? Now I will cultivate at home for a few days and then make a decision. But I feel a little depressed and unhappy, and most of the followers are gone, so I am very lonely.
