### The Japanese Southward Invasion Situation Intensifies; China and Britain Cooperate to Defend the Burma Road; China Plans Defense Initiatives and Stations Heavy Troops in Yunnan; British Far East Air Force Greatly Strengthened with American Aid

Reuters, London, 8th: The general impression is that the tense situation in the Far East has become more acute. Japanese newspapers continue to publish uncompromising and provocative discussions. Official spokespersons and radio stations adopt the same trend, delivering lengthy speeches attempting to portray the aggression of democratic countries. Their aim is to conquer Thailand and encircle Japan. The "Japan Times," directly under the control of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has even begun a propaganda campaign for the independence of the Dutch East Indies, effectively inciting British and American intervention in Batavia, and claiming that an independent Dutch East Indies would cooperate with Japan. Every message coming from Bangkok indicates that the Thai people are well aware of where the threat comes from. Today, Bangkok Radio mentioned rumors of Japanese troops concentrating on the Thai border and a three-pronged military attack within three days. Singapore has released exciting news about the strength of the British Far East Air Force, stating that high-speed American-made fighters are now flying over the Burma Road to new bases in Burma, ready to intercept any bombing of the Burma Road that the Japanese might attempt from their new bases in Vietnam. New airfields in Burma are also stationed with British bombers, hindering any westward advance by Japan. The Chinese government is also taking steps to resist the Japanese offensive on the Burma Road. The Chinese Supreme Command has drafted a defense plan, and Chinese troops have been deployed within Yunnan Province, bordering Vietnam. News from Saigon states that some British expatriates there are scheduled to depart for Singapore on Sunday, although they have not received official instructions to leave.

Havas, Washington, 7th: Well-informed sources here recently stated that Britain is now planning to go beyond diplomatic negotiations and economic retaliation, and cooperate fully with the United States to take new steps to stop aggressive actions. These steps may be used against Japan in the future. Britain's attitude relies solely on American assistance.

Havas, Washington, 7th: Secretary of State Hull met with Australian Federal Minister to the US, Casey, today to discuss the Far East situation. Afterwards, Minister Casey declined to comment on Japan's southward advance policy, only stating that the Australian Federation firmly believes that the most suitable place to defend Australia is far beyond its coast.

United Press, Melbourne, 8th: Australian Navy Minister Hughes declared yesterday that war or peace in the Pacific depends on Japan's attitude. He stated, "The so-called encirclement by Japan is nonsense. They have now established themselves on territory fifty times larger than mainland Japan."

Reuters, Bangkok, 8th: The warnings against Japanese aggression in Thailand issued simultaneously by British Foreign Secretary Eden and Secretary of State Hull have made a great impression here. It is generally believed that Hull's remarks are good, but more detailed statements are needed to effectively eliminate the specter of war in the Far East. The Thai-Japanese situation currently appears calm on the surface, but the worrisome undercurrents have not been eliminated.

### Thailand Resolves to Defend Its Territorial Integrity Regardless of Sacrifice

United Press, Bangkok, 8th: Sources close to the Prime Minister told United Press reporters yesterday that Thailand has no intention of allowing foreign countries to use bases within its territory. When asked about contradictory rumors that Britain and Japan had requested bases from Thailand, the source stated that even if such requests were made, the government had no intention of yielding. He stated that Thailand is prepared to resist any action that endangers Thailand's independence and territorial integrity. At the same time, there are widespread rumors here that there will be changes in the American diplomatic mission.

### Large Quantities of American Cotton Cloth Soon to Be Shipped to China for Use in Making Clothing for the Chinese Army

United Press, Washington, 8th: Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced yesterday that administrators of the Lend-Lease Act had ordered 10 million yards of cotton fabric for use in making clothing for Chinese soldiers. Morgenthau stated that the cotton fabric would be used to manufacture uniforms for the Chinese army. He also mentioned that this move had been approved a few days ago. The Treasury Secretary stated that he had met with Soviet Ambassador Oumansky, but that he believed they had discussed US-Soviet financial issues. Morgenthau announced that the government had given notice to a silk factory in Chile, allowing it to recover stored silk from a contracted stockpile for weaving parachutes for the US Army paratroopers.

### Japan Busily Deploying Troops Southward and Preparing to Attack Northward, Waiting for the Opportunity to Act

Reuters, London, 8th: London newspapers recently carried news from responsible sources in London that Thailand is "undoubtedly in a dangerous situation," under headlines as long as seven or eight columns. The newspapers also gave special prominence to news of Japanese troop movements and the Tokyo Radio Station's announcement yesterday that "war may break out at any time." According to information received by responsible persons in London, the Japanese have concentrated attack-capable troops in eastern Harbin and northern Manchuria, one hundred miles from Vladivostok. Japanese troops in Vietnam have occupied Tay Ninh, which is only 250 miles from Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, which is in a dangerous situation. It is believed here that if Japan takes military action, Thailand will do its utmost to resist. In recent weeks, Japan has sent reinforcements to its 250,000 troops stationed in Northeast China and North Korea, and there is evidence that defensive positions are being constructed. It is not difficult for Japan to send troops through Lushun and Dalian to reinforce its troops stationed in North China and Korea, but the strength of the Soviet army in Siberia is very strong. The Soviet Far East Army totals one million men, who are well-trained and equipped, and commanded by capable generals. Japan must station a large part of its troops in China, which is a disadvantage. Japan has now landed 50,000 troops in Vietnam and occupied eight airfields. Thailand's army totals 50,000 men with limited equipment. Its air force personnel are limited, but brave and good at fighting. It is believed here that if Japan attempts to attack Singapore, it will exhaust all its strength and still fail. Britain has allocated huge sums of money to make Singapore stronger. The quality of the British air force there is unmatched by Japan, and reinforcements have recently been sent to strengthen the defense. The Malay chiefs are also enthusiastically cooperating in defense plans for their country. Burma is also in a very favorable position and will be able to repel foreign attacks.

### Far East Interests Seriously Threatened; Britain and the United States Can No Longer Tolerate Japan

Reuters, London, 8th: This morning, major London newspapers carried stern criticisms of Japan, accusing it of having two faces and conducting the same newspaper propaganda campaign as it did before invading Vietnam. The Times stated that Japan seems to have decided to disregard the warnings of Britain and the United States, and after occupying Vietnam, will continue with actions against Thailand. Japan's naval bases in Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay, and air force bases in western Vietnam, are serious threats to the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Burma, Malaya, and in fact the entire southern Pacific region. If Japan were allowed to gain a foothold in Thailand, this threat would become intolerable. Regardless of how eager the Thai government is to maintain its independence, it may not be able to resist the pressure exerted by Japan unless it is absolutely certain that it can rely on the immediate assistance of Britain and the United States. Regarding the reported belief among the people of Hong Kong that unless Japan is warned against further advances, war will break out and Thailand will soon follow in the footsteps of Vietnam, given the dangerous situation of Britain's major interests and the difficulty of stopping the Japanese once they advance, there is no doubt about this belief. British public opinion on this matter can be seen in the remarks of British Foreign Secretary Eden on this matter. The newspaper also mentioned that Japan is not satisfied with threatening Thailand in the south, and is also deploying troops northward in Manchuria to threaten the Soviet Union. Germany may be willing for Japan to attack northward to provide effective assistance to the German forces who are currently facing setbacks on their way to Moscow, but the Soviet troops in eastern Siberia appear to be superior to the troops that Japan can deploy there, and the Soviet Union's position in Vladivostok is of great importance. If Japan attacks there, the blow to Britain will be no less than that to its ally, the Soviet Union. The "Daily Telegraph" stated that Japan has two faces, saying that Japan's formal response to the warnings of British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Secretary of State Hull against actions in Thailand indicates that it has been misunderstood and that its intentions are purely peaceful, while at the same time, Japanese broadcasters are ordered to propagate to their people that war may break out at any time, and Japanese newspapers are also daily carrying out their roars towards Britain and the United States. While Japan is practicing two faces, its Prime Minister Konoe has repeatedly met with the Emperor for consultations. The newspaper also stated that Thailand cannot be unaware of the threat to itself, and the people of Thailand will certainly not welcome being exploited by Japan. In short, few countries in the East would want Japan as their master. If the Thai people resist aggression, they will receive immediate assistance, as Britain and the United States both recognize that Japan's invasion of Thailand will threaten their interests and security.

### Thailand Refuses Japanese Aircraft from Flying to Bangkok; Border Demarcation Meeting between Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan May Not Be Held as Scheduled

Reuters, Saigon, 8th: Thai representatives of the border demarcation committee, including Shangmi, have arrived here. The Japanese planned to send a four-engine seaplane from Saigon to Bangkok to transport them, but it is heard that Thailand has now refused Japanese aircraft from flying to Bangkok.

United Press, Vichy, 8th: The government announced last night that the Japanese delegation, chaired by Yano, had arrived in Saigon to demarcate the border between Vietnam and Thailand. At the same time, another report stated that the situation in Thailand is tense because Bangkok declared its recognition of Manchukuo and because Britain is increasing its troops in Singapore. The Thai delegation for border demarcation is expected to arrive in Saigon at any time. The first plenary session will be held on Sunday and will continue until the end of August. After the meeting, all representatives will go to the border area in early September to demarcate the border line on the ground.

### Flood Prevention Issues During the Autumn Flood Season

The rainy season has just passed, and the typhoon season is approaching. The peak of the autumn flood season is coming. This is usually not considered important in urban life, but today's concessions often see vehicles driving through water and boats navigating the land. Wading in shallow or deep water has become a common sight after heavy rains. The problem of water accumulation has become more prevalent in recent years, and we have seen it twice this year. Although we have heard explanations for why the water is difficult to drain, we have not seen any efforts to dredge or prevent flooding. Therefore, the inconvenience caused to the public by autumn floods will likely only worsen.

The reason for water accumulation in the concessions is said to be the failure of the Huangpu River to drain properly, leading to water accumulation after heavy rains. When high tide suddenly arrives, the drainage pipes flow upwards. The responsibility for this lies where it lies, and we do not want to dwell on it, but one only needs to look at why this phenomenon did not exist before the war to understand that a child deprived of milk is pitiable, and that weather needs care! However, the cause of the blockage is not limited to this. The drainage pipes in the International Settlement flow east to the Huangpu River and north and south into the Wusong River, and the ships moored on both sides of the Wusong River leave only a narrow channel for boats to pass, obstructing the water flow and making it prone to accumulation. As the tide ebbs and flows, the water recedes and sand remains. The mouths of the drainage pipes are easily blocked, and the water on the ground loses its outlet, making it difficult to drain. This may be one reason, so dredging the Huangpu must also include dredging the Wusong. As for the sewage in the French Concession, it has always relied on the Huangpu River, the Lujiabang, the Rihui Port, and the Puzhao River for drainage, but today the road east of Rihui Port to the Huangpu has become a thoroughfare, and the Puzhao and Rihui Ports are heavily silted up. The large canals are unfavorable, and the small ditches are difficult to drain. The western districts of the two concessions used to have many open fields with crisscrossing rivers, which could have slightly compensated for the inadequacy of the canals and stored some of the surface water, but they have all been blocked and buried by road and building construction projects, cutting them off horizontally and vertically. The accumulated water has nowhere to go, so the western districts are prone to waterlogging. Furthermore, due to the different development of the city, the old roads cannot accommodate the huge, heavy, fast, and powerful vehicles without being widened; similarly, the drainage pipes cannot accommodate the sewage discharged by a densely populated area without being rebuilt and enlarged. However, the reconstruction of the engineering is not easy, so the extent and depth of the waterlogged areas almost increase with the increase in population and households. Even when the roads were initially built, there was no consideration of the terrain, water level, rainfall, and prosperity of the market to plan the width and thickness of the road surface and the layout and size of the drainage pipes. If all these factors had been considered, there would have been no accumulation of water. But what is the situation now? It cannot be said that the initial planning was poor and narrow-minded, leading to this failure!

We are not unaware that in this environment, public construction is impossible and financially infeasible. However, the inconvenience to the public caused by water accumulation is now at its worst and cannot be ignored. The lives of people in Shanghai today are different from the past. Going out in the morning and returning in the evening has become the norm. Furthermore, due to the development of industry and commerce and the prosperity of the market, rents are high, so people have retreated from the bustling areas to remote areas. However, convenient transportation has become inconvenient. What they usually rely on to travel long distances and still get to work on time is public transportation, which alleviates their difficulties and facilitates their travel. Now, whenever there is water accumulation, public transportation vehicles shorten their routes or even stop. We have not heard of any consideration for public convenience or any prompt measures to restore the vehicles to operation as soon as possible. On the roads, every step is through water, submerging the ankles; inside the houses, dirty water flows in and out, making it impossible to live in peace. We have not heard of any quick drainage work to allow the water to recede as soon as possible. As for the water that surges upwards from the drainage pipes, it is unbearably smelly, and germs breed, invading the human body, causing illness and even death, or prolonged illness that becomes a lifelong burden. The impact of water accumulation on public health, daily life, and welfare is so profound that it cannot be regarded as one of the most serious problems in society. Moreover, the rainfall in Shanghai this year has been the highest in history. In June, it was 10.08 inches, and in July, it was 9.25 inches, far exceeding the same period last year, indicating that the rainy season this year has been abundant. It is difficult to predict what the rainfall will be like in the future. However, yesterday (August 8th) was the first day of autumn, and it coincided with a typhoon sweeping through the city. There was wind and rain all day long, and the low-lying areas saw the third water accumulation. We also heard that the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been rising continuously, reaching 80 feet, breaking a 30-year record. We do not remember the water level in the upper reaches being so high in 1931. The areas along the Yangtze River in Hubei and Anhui were flooded, and refugees flooded down the river, and Shanghai set up shelters to accommodate them until the January 28th Incident, when they were all evacuated. Now, the water from the upper reaches is pouring down in a torrent. The levees in central Hubei may not be able to withstand the vast and turbulent force, and will likely become swamps. If the Han River also floods, Wuhan will be in danger of sinking. As the water flows eastward, can the low-lying areas along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu and Anhui remain intact? In peacetime, Shanghai is still plagued by tides. If the Yangtze River is high, although the lower reaches are wide, the deposition of sediment will greatly constrict the flow of the flood, preventing it from flowing naturally to the sea. If it flows backwards into the Huangpu River and is attracted by the tidal currents, it will float upwards for a long time, making Shanghai a possible habitat for water creatures. Wouldn't it be too late to plan for flood prevention and drainage work at that time?

Autumn rains cannot be avoided, and typhoons cannot be prevented. Given Shanghai's large population, thriving commerce, and heavy burdens, all measures should be taken to prevent problems before they occur, and what citizens should enjoy should be prepared in advance. The problem of water accumulation on roads is so severe and occurs so often that even if the entire engineering improvement cannot be realized immediately, efforts should be made to improve the situation whenever and wherever possible. In the future, when roads and houses are built, all drainage facilities should meet the required standards. Before everything is fully improved, reasonable drainage pumping stations should be planned quickly so that temporary water accumulation can be eliminated in an instant, unlike the current situation where water accumulates for many days and does not recede. More attention should be paid to the operation of public transportation vehicles, not only to avoid inconvenience to people, but also to provide as much convenience as possible for people to travel to and from work, which is the duty of the municipal government and does not need to be discussed.

### Meeting Between US and British Leaders Becomes Open Secret; Importance of this Move Undeniable; US Military Leaders Not in Washington

Havas, Washington, 7th: After President Roosevelt set sail on the yacht "Potomac," he issued his first communiqué, which did not mention a meeting between President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill, only stating that the President had learned of international developments via radio. Although it is generally known that this yacht is currently in the waters of the New England states, the official position remains silent on where it will sail.

Reuters, Washington, 8th: As far as Washington insiders are concerned, the rumors of a Roosevelt-Churchill meeting are no longer considered mysterious. It is generally believed that the two leaders are likely to meet. There are only two places Churchill can go: either Moscow or the United States to meet with the US President. It is speculated that if Churchill went to the Soviet capital, news would inevitably leak out, so it is concluded that he must be coming to meet with President Roosevelt. The focus is not on whether the two leaders will meet, but on the reason for the meeting. Some political observers believe that this decision is a precursor to important events and steps, and some speculate that Hopkins has returned from Moscow with urgent news that the Soviet Union must be aided with all efforts to stop the German advance. If these two leaders do hold a meeting, it will be a temporary gathering without prior exchange of opinions or arrangements, and its importance is evident. There is reason to believe that the State Department is unaware of the arrangements for this meeting, so the content of the meeting is known only to President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, and Hopkins. It is also believed here that if the US Chief of Staff and Secretary of the Navy Knox were indeed with the President, Churchill would not necessarily go, because the US Congress would inevitably react politically to the British Prime Minister talking to the US military leaders. However, it is known that Generals Marshall and Arnold of the General Staff are both traveling elsewhere, far from the President's location, and Secretary of the Navy Knox and Chief of Naval Operations Stark have also not gone to the President's location.

### Thailand Willing to Maintain Open Door Policy; No Favoritism Towards Britain or Japan

Reuters, Bangkok, 8th: Thai Commerce Superintendent Panalongda, one of the Thai representatives to the Tokyo mediation meeting, told reporters that the Thai market is not closed to any country, and Britain has always been able to obtain the supply of Thai goods as needed. Japan has not made any economic demands on Thailand. The Japanese spokesperson's statement yesterday that economic negotiations between Japan and Thailand are still in progress refers to Japan's recent loan of 10 million Thai baht from a Thai banking group. Thailand maintains an open door policy for all countries trading with Thailand and does not want to give special treatment to any country. When asked about the possibility of Japan demanding exclusive rights to Thai rice, tin, and rubber, Panalongda replied that this is unlikely, as Japan has already purchased large quantities of these goods. A newspaper reported that Thailand rejected more than ten Japanese requests before finally agreeing to recognize Manchukuo. The Thai Ministry of Finance stated that Thailand's funds abroad are currently safe and sound, and there is no basis for the rumor that they have been frozen. Most of Thailand's funds are deposited in Britain and the United States.

Reuters, Bangkok, 8th: Official sources believe that the Japanese rumor that China, Britain, and the United States have protested to Thailand over Thailand's recognition of Manchukuo is not true. No matter what, China cannot protest because there are no diplomatic relations between China and Thailand.

### Japan Decides to Send Special Envoy to Vietnam to Promote Friendly Relations

Reuters, Tokyo, 8th: It is heard that the government has decided to send a special envoy to Vietnam to promote friendly relations between the two countries. The selection of the person is currently being considered by the Foreign Minister.

### Chinese Army in Hubei Closes in on Shashi; Expands Gains Near Yichang; Captures Many Important Strongholds

Changde: A certain mobile unit of the Chinese army, taking advantage of the Japanese army in Shashi's offense, attacked Shashi by detour with extremely rapid action. At 6:00 PM on the 7th, it had advanced to the vicinity of Shashi and is currently launching a fierce attack on Shashi. (7th dispatch)

Enshi: The war near Yichang is progressing smoothly for the Chinese army, and it is now expanding its gains. The Japanese army in the area of Jujihe and Shibanwan (north of Yichang) was completely defeated by the Chinese army on the 5th. More than 100 Japanese troops are still on the line from Longwangdong to Xiaoxita, and they are also under the control of the Chinese army. The important strongholds of the Japanese army on the opposite bank of the Xiling Gorge in western Yichang, such as Xiangzikou, Yujiapu, and Sunjiaqiao (west of Meiyanzi), have been recaptured by the Chinese army after days of attacks. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in this battle. (6th dispatch)

A certain place in southern Anhui: The Japanese army that invaded from the east was repelled by the Chinese army at noon on the 3rd. The Japanese army in the direction of Tuqiao has also been completely cleared, and the original situation was restored that night. (7th dispatch)

A part of the Japanese army in Dongliu launched a three-pronged invasion on the morning of the 3rd. After fierce fighting until noon, all were repelled. At 1:00 AM on the 3rd, a group landed from Dawang in Dongliu and immediately invaded Huabaizikeng, Tuyan, and other places. After the joint attack by the Chinese army and the people, the Japanese army dispersed. A group invaded Zhangjianzhen, Heshanling, Majie, and other places from the Wai Fengjian in the south. The Chinese army resisted all the way, and the Japanese army was unable to hold on and retreated, and Zhangjianzhen and other places were often announced to be recovered. A group, under the cover of Japanese artillery, launched a fierce attack on Zhoujiashan in China. After the Chinese army resisted, after fierce fighting until 7:00 AM, the Japanese army also retreated. The Chinese army followed up and pursued, and obtained countless spoils of war. (7th dispatch)

Changde: On the morning of the 5th, the Japanese army that landed in Donglou, Xiwanyueyang, and Qianjiang on the opposite bank was surrounded by the Chinese army, and by midnight, it was completely cleared. There is no trace of the Japanese in that area now. (7th dispatch)

Changde: Since the 3rd, there has been fierce fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies in the area north of Haozui. The Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties. At 3:00 PM yesterday, many wounded Japanese soldiers were transported north from Caojiazui via Yangjiazui. (7th dispatch)

Chinese Army Dominates in the War This Week

Chongqing: A military spokesperson reported on the war situation, saying that there were two more important battles this week. One was the Japanese army's attempt to strike at the Chinese army north of Yichang in order to reduce the threat to Yichang. The other was the joint attack on Haozui by the Japanese army in Shashi, Shayang, and Qianjiang. Haozui is located between Yueyang and Jingzhou, controlling the traffic between the two, and it is rich in materials and a channel for the Chinese army to cross the river. Therefore, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on it with more than 6,000 troops in four directions starting from the 3rd. Only one of them advanced to a place 6-7 kilometers from Haozui, and the rest made no progress. As for the war in northern Yichang, the Japanese army attacked northwest from Shanlongquanpu with more than 1,000 troops on the 24th of last month, but was repelled by the Chinese army in Fenxiangchang. They then reinforced and attacked again on the 27th. After fierce fighting until the 29th, they were still defeated. Then, they gathered 13,000 troops between Yichang and Dangyang and advanced west in three directions on the 30th. The Chinese army then crossed the river to the west bank north of Yichang, gathered its forces, and launched a fierce attack on the middle and right wings of the Japanese army on the 2nd. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, leaving behind 1,700 corpses and a large number of weapons, and retreated to their original positions. However, their left wing, with reinforcements from Yichang, crossed the river on the 4th and broke through a part of the Chinese army's positions. But we have just received a report from the front that the Chinese army has restored its original positions. The spokesperson explained this battle, saying that the Japanese initially attacked with more than 1,000 troops, but were eventually forced to increase to 13,000 troops. This proves that the theory of mud feet is not credible. (7th Havas dispatch)

### Japanese Planes Bomb Hunan, Jiangxi, etc.; Chinese Losses Very Slight; Intention Clearly to Disrupt Transportation; Yan'an in Northern Shaanxi Attacked for the First Time

Chongqing – A military spokesperson today answered reporters' questions, saying that the Japanese planes have been bombing various parts of Hunan for days, their intention clearly being to disrupt transportation. Speaking from the perspective of vehicles in transit, this action might be somewhat more effective than bombing Chongqing, but fortunately, Chinese losses are very slight. Furthermore, Yan'an, the base of the Eighteenth Group Army, was bombed, marking the first time since the start of the war. The reason for Japan's sudden move is still unknown. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

Ji'an – In the past week, Japanese planes have frequently attacked western Jiangxi. At 2:00 PM on the 7th, 27 Japanese planes again attacked Ji'an, Taihe, and other places in batches. The first batch of nine planes invaded Fenyi and dropped bombs. The second batch of nine planes first dropped bombs on Zhangshu, then flew to Ji'an and dropped many incendiary bombs. The third batch of nine planes flew through Zhangshu and Jishui into Ji'an, dropped several more bombs, and then flew to Taihe to drop bombs, before retreating north successively. (Dispatch, 7th)

Xi'an – Seven Japanese planes bombed Baoji again at 5:50 AM on the 7th, while another three planes disturbed the Gansu border, flying over Lanzhou, Tianshui, and the surrounding areas along the river, spying before retreating east. (Dispatch, 7th)

Japanese Planes Fiercely Bomb Chongqing

Chongqing – More than 80 Japanese planes fiercely bombed Chongqing at 2:30 PM today, causing significant damage and a few casualties. Air defense outposts had detected a total of 136 Japanese planes flying towards Chongqing, but it is estimated that only 70 to 80 actually participated in the attack. The Japanese planes dropped bombs along the south bank of the upper reaches of the Xizijiang River, from the safe zone and Jiangbei District to the Jialing River bank. The first batch of Japanese planes bombed the lower areas of Chongqing's main city and the southern bank area upstream from the safe zone at 1:30 PM. By 2:30 PM, the second batch of Japanese planes concentrated their bombing on the western district. The Press Association building was also bombed, and although it was not damaged, it was severely shaken. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

### U.S. Senate Passes Conscription Bill; Military Service Extended by Two and a Half Years

Washington, Associated Press dispatch, 8th – The Senate passed a bill yesterday authorizing the War Department to extend the term of service for conscripted soldiers, the National Guard, and reservists to 18 months or two and a half years. The bill also authorizes the Army to extend the service of enlisted soldiers by 18 months in addition to their three years of formal service. The bill has now been sent to the House of Representatives for discussion.

Washington, Havas dispatch, 7th – According to an announcement by the War Department, the U.S. active military force totals 1,581,000 personnel, of which 1,669,500 are soldiers.

### Casual Talk on the European War (7) (3) An Eyewitness Account of Escorting Across the Atlantic

We have reached the danger zone.

We are approaching Malin Head off the coast of Donegal, the northernmost tip of Ireland, and the sunlight shines on the emerald green hills. Our ships, still in close formation, continue to move forward. The destroyers that have been accompanying us are bustling, moving back and forth, but we know that every destroyer is acting according to plan. Submarine attacks have been prevented. The sea is quite calm, and a few white clouds hang listlessly in the pale blue sky. We struggled through storms for several days, and now the weather is fine. In fact, the weather today seems a little too good. In this kind of calm weather, submarines are not impacted by huge waves and do not expose their thick steel hulls, so they are not easily discovered. Dive bombers also like clear weather.

A destroyer two miles to the left, which had been leisurely, suddenly became active, revving its engines and rushing towards the harbor. From its four smokestacks, it can be seen that it is an old American destroyer. A large waterfall suddenly flew up on the sea thirty yards from its stern. Five seconds later, an explosion occurred, and even our large cargo ship shook violently. The destroyer had found a submarine and dropped a depth charge. Another old American destroyer came to help. A Lockheed Hudson aircraft from our coastal air command was escorting us, and two more, flying less than fifty feet high, were identifying the exact location of the submarine above the destroyers.

Two more fountains flew straight up, and the sunlight shone on the water spray, seeming to dance in the clear and gentle air. Then the sound of explosions came again, and our ship shook again.

The destroyers darted back and forth like small hounds, and the two Hudson aircraft roared happily. Finally, the destroyers resumed their patrol work, and the aircraft flew back and hovered over the convoy again. A destroyer signaled with a signal lamp.

The first mate ran down from the bridge and told us that the destroyer had hit a submarine, and a large oil slick had surfaced on the sea. The "Asdic" indicator could no longer find its location.

Several ships have left us and sailed to another port. The journey is indeed long, but the convoy is not traveling in a straight line. We have sailed far north, zigzagging, and changing course every few hours.

We have been well protected from beginning to end. Gradually, we sailed out of the dangerous area patrolled by German raiders in the North Atlantic, and finally entered the submarine-infested sea. More than nine-tenths of the ships we lost were sunk in the eastern Atlantic. Now we need another kind of protection. We need fast destroyers as the ears of the convoy to detect and destroy submarines. We also need aircraft as the eyes of the convoy to fight against German dive bombers. As we passed through the North Sea Strait, through the Irish Sea, we knew that the battlefields on the shore were waiting for us to be attacked by German aircraft. From the moment we saw land, the distance between Spitfires and Hurricanes and us would be no more than fifteen minutes. The Navy and Air Force both protected us, and the coordination was very good.

I took a cargo ship from Canada, crossed the Atlantic, and am now docked in a British port, writing this report during a large meal. I know that of the ships that left Canada with us, there were more than fifty in total, and by this evening, every one of them had arrived in a British port.

Mines, of course, often pose a threat to convoys. Mines can be divided into three types: the ordinary floating mines used in the last European war, anchored magnetic mines, and tethered contact mines. German mines are anchored because floating mines drift with the wind and can also endanger German submarines. Mine anchor chains are rarely longer than forty inches or one hundred and forty feet, so if the convoy knows that the water under the ship is more than forty inches deep, it does not need to worry about mines. However, sometimes it is not like that.

Four days ago, I was standing on the deck with the chief engineer when we suddenly heard two sharp and piercing bells. The lookout on the crow's nest had spotted something.

At this time, the waves were surging. I looked to starboard but saw nothing. Looking back, I saw the gunners gathered behind the guns. I borrowed binoculars from the chief engineer—readers should know that only military reporters in movies carry binoculars with them—but still saw nothing. A destroyer—another old American destroyer—turned around like a whirlwind, standing between our cargo ship and the ships on the starboard side. At this time, I saw something black sixty yards away, like a large buoy. In fact, it was not a buoy, but a mine.

Flashes of light came from the destroyer's bridge. Ships only used flag signals in the past, but now they were using signal lamps to send dots and dashes, communicating with each other. Strangely, they could not be seen from a distance in the daylight. The ships behind us had to stay away from the destroyer and the lone mine. The destroyer pitched and rolled in the rolling waves, two hundred yards away from the mine.

After each ship passed, there was only a burst of machine gun fire, and then nothing was heard.

A large cannonball could destroy the mine. The destroyer did not want to waste cannonballs on drifting mines, so it used machine guns instead. The bullets pierced the outer shell of the mine, the seawater entered, and it sank to the bottom of the sea.

We were very lucky that the night we reached the British coast was very dark. We passed through the prohibited zone of Rathslin Island, only one mile from Ireland, and the weary ships were very fortunate to pass through the strait.

We were very careful because although this was British territorial waters, it was covered with both British and German mines. Even hitting a small mine would be terrible because the ship was full of explosives!

In the distance to the right, a searchlight suddenly shone into the dark sky. We were near Belfast and just happened to encounter an air raid. The calm air in the darkness carried the faint drone of German aircraft. Because of the distance, the heavy sound of artillery was almost inaudible. The sound of the aircraft engines grew louder, and they were getting closer and closer, but the darkness covered us, and they unknowingly missed this batch of spoils.

The ocean is like a forest, but the mines buried under the surface and the lurking submarines are more terrifying than poisonous snakes and beasts. (The End)

### Reuters Military Observer Discusses the Current Situation of the World War; While the Center of Attention Remains in the Soviet Union, Germany and Japan Can Act Elsewhere at Any Time; Britain Should Quickly Launch a Decisive Blow

London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – A Reuters military commentator said that the center of general concern remains in the Soviet Union, but other aspects must also be paid attention to and acted upon soon to deal with them. The Nazi threats to Turkey and Spain are still possible, and we in the Pacific are on the verge of a break with Japan. How Japan can avoid war with the United States is also difficult to predict. Hitler is now putting great pressure on the Vichy people under his wing to forcibly occupy ports and air bases on the northwest coast. Therefore, we must be prepared to act in any or all of these areas. This will certainly require more use of our resources to cope with it, but this is not beyond our capabilities. Fortunately, we have been preparing and have a large reserve force to deal with various emergencies. Regarding the Soviet front, the Germans are now claiming great victories, but according to the facts we know, there is no evidence to support what the Germans are saying. The German army in the north, together with the Finnish army, is still struggling on the northwest shore of Lake Ladoga and has not yet reached the eastern end of the lake. Although they want to peep at Leningrad, they have made no progress. The Germans claim to have occupied Kholm, but this is quite doubtful and, at present, does not pose a serious threat to the Soviet position. The Germans also claim that the Battle of Smolensk has ended, but the road to Moscow seems to be tightly closed. From the phenomenon, the fighting on this road is about to resume, and it will be the Soviet army, taking the initiative and launching an attack, that will open this road. The success of Moscow's air defense is also a cause of anxiety for the Germans, which proves the authority of the Soviet Air Force. The great reserves of Soviet troops and aircraft have not yet been fully used on the battlefield. In addition to exhausted troops, the Germans do not seem to have elite troops to meet the future Soviet offensive. However, although the future of the Soviet-German army is not optimistic, Germany can still take new adventures in northwest Africa, while simultaneously crossing Spain with five or six divisions to encircle Gibraltar, in order to establish a shorter transportation line with Morocco and Dakar. If Germany succeeds in this area, it can be in a favorable position in the war against Britain in the Atlantic and also become a real threat to the entire Americas. The United States cannot sit idly by and not rise up to resist this German action. From a military standpoint, it is essential to launch a rapid attack before Germany and its Vichy friends can consolidate their position in Dakar. We are currently showing activity in Tobruk and the Mediterranean. Germany seems to have withdrawn some of its air force and several divisions of its army from Libya. It is now urgent for Britain to launch a decisive blow. If the enemy is cleared from North Africa, and our naval and air forces can occupy the North African coast, reaching Tripoli, then not only will the naval position in the Mediterranean be strengthened, but our air force will also have a greater advantage, and the Middle East Allied forces will be able to provide support to Turkey when Germany attacks Turkey.

### In the North African War, Britain Gains the Initiative; The Threat to Invade Egypt Has Been Completely Eliminated; Italian Troops in Abyssinia Will Be Cleared Out

London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – Responsible sources claim that the initiative in the western desert battlefield has now completely shifted to the British army. The Axis powers, instead of threatening to invade Egypt, are now worried about the possibility of the British army invading Libya, Sicily, and the Greek islands. It is heard that the British army has recently taken the offensive on the Sollum front, destroying many German armored vehicles, preventing the German army on that line from attacking in the short term. The British army in Tobruk is still holding out. The British army's invasion of Syria has finally broken Hitler's entire plan for the Middle East. The Italian troops still resisting in East Africa are now only holding out in Gondar and another besieged area. It is estimated that there are still 3,000 Italian soldiers and 6,000 native soldiers in the Gondar area. Therefore, the British army must leave some troops in East Africa to carry out the mop-up operation, but the enemy troops have been surrounded and are not receiving supplies, and will eventually surrender. Italian communiqués have exaggerated the British army's attack on the Tobruk salient. Responsible sources have refuted this, stating that although the enemy's casualties cannot be accurately estimated, they must be significant. The British army suffered 28 dead, 104 wounded, and 8 missing. After a fierce battle, the British army charged into the enemy's right-wing outpost. The enemy then used mortars and machine guns to bombard them, causing many casualties to both the enemy and the British army. At dusk, news came that the enemy's left-wing outpost had been occupied by the British army, defended by two officers and seventeen soldiers (eight of whom were seriously injured), and that eight German soldiers had been captured. The British side sent a large force of infantry to reinforce, but were blocked by heavy artillery fire. At the same time, the enemy counterattacked and recaptured the outpost.

Cairo, Reuters dispatch, 8th – Yesterday's British Air Force communiqué stated that on August 5, British and South African Air Force bombers continuously attacked ports and airfields held by the enemy in North Africa. Benghazi was attacked, and the breakwater was hit. Motor transport vehicles and cold storage warehouses at the Derna airfield were bombed and caught fire. Enemy airfields and barracks in Gazala and other places were also bombed and heavily damaged. On the same night, several enemy planes sneaked into Malta and dropped bombs. British fighter planes took off to intercept them, shooting down three enemy planes. On the same night, British naval air force planes attacked Augusta, the Italian submarine base on the island of Sicily, flying low and dropping heavy bombs, hitting the submarine mooring area, causing a huge fire. An hour later, another naval aircraft flew to the area and saw that the fire was still blazing. Only one British aircraft was lost in the attack.

### Funeral Held for Italian Premier's Second Son

Rome, Associated Press dispatch, 8th – Officials stated that the funeral of Mussolini's son, Bruno, who died in a plane crash, will be held today in his hometown of Predappio.

Rome, Reuters dispatch, 8th – Yesterday morning, an Italian new aircraft crashed during a test flight near Pisa. Mussolini's son, Bruno, and two officers were killed, and five other officers were injured. After the accident, Mussolini and his eldest son, Vittorio, flew to Pisa and stayed for a short time in the mortuary of the Santa Chiara Hospital, before going to inspect the scene of the accident. The downed aircraft was a new four-engine bomber, belonging to a squadron that was being formed and would soon go into battle. Bruno was the commander of the squadron. Semi-official sources said that the cause of the accident was a mystery. The aircraft suddenly crashed at around 10:00 AM near the Sangesto flight port while preparing to land. The Italian King has telegraphed Mussolini his condolences. Bruno is survived by a wife and a daughter who is only eighteen months old.

### Battles in Various Parts of the Soviet Territory; No Major German Advances; Germans in Ukraine Are Advancing Southeast; Red Army Repels Six Attacks on Kiev

London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – The latest Soviet war report stated that on August 7, Soviet troops fought resolutely with the enemy in the Kexholm, Kholm, Smolensk, and Velikiye Luki areas. No major battles occurred in other areas of the front. The Soviet Air Force, in cooperation with the Army, continued to strike at enemy mechanized forces and infantry on the battlefield and enemy aircraft at airfields, shooting down 37 enemy aircraft. The Soviets also lost 19 aircraft. On August 6, enemy aircraft raided Moscow at night and nine were shot down. The previous report of six was inaccurate.

London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – According to sources here, the German invasion of the Soviet Union has been contained, and progress everywhere is very slow. Although they still maintain the initiative, the German High Command is undoubtedly disappointed with the slow progress of the troops and the heavy casualties. The latest news is that there are no major changes in the Soviet war situation, and the German troops in the Smolensk area are almost static. In Ukraine, the German troops are advancing southeast. If they achieve a major victory, or can seize the Caucasus, then Britain's position in the Middle East will be threatened.

London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – The German radio station broadcast a special communiqué from the German High Command last night, stating that the annihilation war against the well-equipped Soviet army has not ended and a new stage of the war is now underway, indicating that the heavily troubled Soviet army still has strong resistance.

London, Associated Press dispatch, 8th – Authoritative sources said yesterday that the Red Army has repelled six German attacks on Kiev and has forced the Germans to move south in an attempt to flank Kiev. It is heard that General Kleist's tanks had formed a wedge in Zhitomir and approached Kiev, but were driven back by Soviet mechanized units and formidable flat-trajectory guns.

### Nazis Stabilize Domestic Morale by Distorting News of Frontline War Victories

Moscow, Reuters dispatch, 8th – A statement released here today said that in order to boost morale and comfort the public, the Nazis have distorted the progress of the war in the Soviet Union. To this end, the German High Command released a horrifying account of the situation in the Eastern War on August 6. In order to cover up the severity of German losses, German propaganda referred to approaching the heavily fortified Stalin Line. The Soviet government certainly built defensive works in necessary locations, but there are no such lines in the areas where the two armies are currently fighting. In fact, the heavy losses suffered by the German army were not caused by special defense lines, but by the Soviet military and civilians defending their homeland with great courage, turning every inch of land into a stronghold of defense. The number of prisoners of war claimed by the German High Command are actually Soviet men and women civilians, forced by the German army to perform hard labor and driven behind the lines, and then referred to as prisoners of war. In the past six weeks of fighting, the German army has suffered more than 1.5 million casualties. The Red Army has captured or destroyed more than 8,000 German guns, losing 7,000 of its own. The Germans have lost more than 6,000 aircraft, and the Soviets have lost 4,000.

London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – The Nazi offensive on the Eastern Front has been blocked in most places due to the strong resistance of the Red Army. Berlin was forced last night to retract the exaggerated victory news recently published by German newspapers. At the same time, Moscow announced that Soviet troops continued to fight in the Kexholm, Smolensk, Belaya Tserkov, and Estonian areas. There were no major battles in other areas. Today, the opinion in London is that the German offensive against Odessa on the Black Sea and the advance along the south bank of the Dnieper River have become quite serious matters. There are reports that the railway line between Kiev and Odessa has been cut off. The continued advance of the German troops may isolate the Soviet troops in Odessa. According to Moscow, 39 German aircraft were shot down yesterday, and the Soviets lost 19 aircraft. There were no air raids on Moscow last night.

Headquarters of the German Führer, Huitong News Agency dispatch, 8th – This morning's official communiqué stated that many Soviet troops in Ukraine, surrounded southeast of Uman, are now being annihilated by the German army. 30,000 prisoners were captured, and the commander of the Soviet Sixth Army was also captured alive. The German army seized countless military supplies.

### Soviet Baltic Fleet Occupies Two Islands Near Hanko Island

Moscow, Associated Press dispatch, 8th – The Baltic Fleet telegraphed yesterday that the Soviet Union had occupied two islands near Hanko Island. The telegram stated that Soviet marines landed on the island from patrol boats, attacking from three sides, subduing the defenders and capturing several enemies. The marines also occupied another island. It was recently heard from TASS that a submarine of the Soviet Northern Fleet had entered a Nazi harbor and destroyed a 6,000-ton transport ship with two torpedoes. The submarine returned safely to base.

### The US and USSR's Effective Cooperation Establishes a Considerable Foundation; Four US Oil Tankers to be Used by the Soviet Union; British Munitions to be Shipped to the USSR via Iran

Moscow, August 8th, United Press International - "Pravda" stated yesterday that effective cooperation between the US and the USSR has established a considerable foundation. This cooperation is for mutual assistance in resisting and destroying the common enemies that threaten "the security and freedom of all nations." "Pravda" also claimed that Germany currently lacks the power to conquer the United States. The newspaper presented evidence of the Nazis' planned attack on the US and stated that Germany was striving to acquire a base in France in preparation for an invasion of the United States. Finally, it stated, "Hitler's threat endangers the entire world."

Washington, August 8th, United Press International - Interior Secretary Ickes stated yesterday that US aviation gasoline will be transported to the Soviet Union using four US oil tankers. Additional barreled aviation oil will be shipped by Soviet merchant vessels. Ickes predicted that the United States might also face a gasoline shortage unless production is increased or imports from other friendly nations are used for military purposes. Ickes stated that these four oil tankers would be fine-tuned on the West Coast. He added that the Soviet Union had requested a substantial quantity of oil, an amount that government experts had not anticipated when estimating US production needs.

Vichy, August 7th, Havas - Political observers here generally believe that the Near East is one of the most important regions at present. They stated that British Foreign Secretary Eden recently issued a statement saying that Britain was prepared to defend the countries between India and the Suez Canal. This statement has apparently been approved by the United States. The first task of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in India, is likely to be in this area. Based on the recent clarification of its position by the Iranian government, it is clear that Britain has begun efforts in this direction. Its first goal seems to be to find a way to transport British ordnance to the Soviet Union via the Iranian national railway after it lands in the Persian Gulf. If this plan becomes a reality, Turkey's situation will be quite difficult, and Turkey will no longer be outside the war zone at that time. It is said that members of the Turkish People's Party recently held a secret meeting to discuss this. Foreign Minister Saracoğlu gave a speech at the meeting, clarifying that the Turkish government would continue to adhere to its policy of neutrality and would not engage in war unless directly attacked.

### Border Conflicts Between Japan and the Soviet Union; Japanese Side Claims Insufficient Importance

Tokyo, August 8th, Reuters - Japanese sources say that officials stated today that rumors that Japan has made demands on Moscow are purely groundless. The Japanese government can also make the same statement as Soviet Foreign Minister Lozovsky, who said yesterday that there have been no changes in Japanese-Soviet relations since the signing of the neutrality pact. As for the clashes between Soviet and Japanese troops on the Siberian border, these are not worth emphasizing. Even if any border conflicts occur, the worst would be accidental clashes between scouting parties and have no political significance. The reason for this is that there is no clear border between northern Manchuria and Soviet territory. Since the Joint Boundary Commission made a decision in Chita on June 16, the work of demarcation has been underway. Japanese newspapers have not recently reported any border clashes.

### British Women and Children in Saigon Scheduled to Evacuate

Saigon, August 8th, Reuters - Although the British Consulate has not issued an order for the evacuation of British citizens, the women and children among the British expatriates here are scheduled to leave for Singapore on Sunday. The number of Japanese troops passing through Saigon has decreased slightly, and it is expected that the Japanese troops will change to using waterways and depart from the mouth of the Mekong River. French government offices are now suddenly painting large white crosses on their roofs, reportedly done on orders from the Vichy government, to ensure the safety of French property in the event of armed conflict in the Far East. This move can be seen as a sign that the French will not participate in the war.

### US Reinforcements Arrive in Iceland

Reykjavik, Iceland, August 8th, United Press International - Officials recently stated that a US air fleet recently arrived here, bringing with it some US reinforcements.

### Tagore's Death; Mourned by All Circles in Britain

London, August 8th, Reuters - All circles in Britain have expressed their sorrow upon hearing the news of the death of Indian poet and philosopher Tagore. Tagore passed away at the age of 80. He had been publishing his articles in newspapers since the age of 24. British scholars of literature and philosophy all admired him as a leader of contemporary thought. In 1913, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, the first Indian to receive this honor. Tagore lectured in England, America, Germany, and various countries in the Far East, and was welcomed everywhere. In October 1937, when Japan invaded China, Tagore vehemently condemned its barbarity and strongly criticized Japan's bombing of Chinese civilians. The Tagore Society of London recently received his last article, which stated, "Western humanity has failed to maintain the value of human civilization and dignity it has created over thousands of years, which frightens me. This is all because humanity does not guide national affairs with moral values and believes that everything is determined by violence. The first test of this evil belief began in Manchuria." London circles are scheduled to hold a memorial service next week, at which celebrities such as George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, and Aldous Huxley will deliver speeches.

### Luce, a Leading Figure in the US Publishing Industry, Returns; Notes from a Visit to Chongqing (5)

At 5:10 AM, we arrived at the foot of a yellow hill, got out of the car, and covered it with tarpaulin. (The countryside here is all yellow earth—dusty like powder, perhaps the oldest soil in the world). The air was clean and cool. A family was working on the threshing ground of a farmhouse. We walked around the farmhouse on a small path and saw a larger parade ground than the threshing ground. A team of soldiers lined up, standing at attention. Military music was playing, and the officers were saluting—but not saluting their commander-in-chief. They were paying their respects to the Republic of China flag flying in the morning light on the distant mountain peak in front of them! The troops then marched forward at a run. What we saw that morning was most of the troops here. The 12,000 men under the command of this small village headquarters were scattered six miles north of the Yellow River.

After the flag was raised and the soldiers dispersed, he led us to a reception room in a mud house. Tea and biscuits were placed on a large table, and the hospitality was very attentive. In this small room, General Zhou issued several orders, and one or two officers came in and out, moving quickly and with strict discipline. General Zhou took out several very clear maps, but they were all drawn on inferior paper. All these maps were shown to us, indicating the positions occupied by his troops on the vast Chinese front.

After refreshments, the general said we could go around the village to take a look. It was a very touching place. At short intervals, there were deep valleys between the eroded walls of yellow earth, each valley capable of garrisoning a company of soldiers. We inspected a valley barracks in detail. The ground in the valley was paved with dust, but there was no trace of dust. There was a plot of land where vegetables could be grown, and something was planted in the ground. Several soldiers were working in the garden. Trees were planted along the street. The general led us all the way from the slope to the toilet. He was very proud; he made sure you couldn't see them; this was a kind of strategy; covering everything with lime or mud. We ran into caves, each cave capable of sleeping fifteen soldiers. There was a table and a bookcase in the cave, with about a hundred books in it. In front of the cave, fifty soldiers were listening attentively to a lecture on political science. He also took us to see a row of mud houses in the village, which the soldiers had newly built for the farmers. He said, "We build houses for the farmers, but they must keep them clean." Of course, it was very clean that morning! He said it was the cleanest thing in China.

At one end of the village, a small team of cavalry gathered. Our group rode Mongolian warhorses—horses so small that it was the first time I had seen them. We rode in single file through the village, the general leading the way. But just as we were about to set off, my wife's horse suddenly bolted into the field, causing her to lose her camera case. We set off on the road to Tongguan, a walled town on the Yellow River. The six or seven-mile journey was mixed with a lot of traffic—donkeys and wheelbarrows—all transporting military supplies for the various armies. We ran into two or three large villages, and there were many people in the villages. The food stores had food piled high. There were vegetable gardens in the valleys between the villages here.

We immediately saw the Yellow River, and we didn't see it again until we were inside the walls of Tongguan. There were mountain ridges at both ends of the city wall, just like the Great Wall. We dismounted at the city gate, which clearly surprised General Zhou's subordinates. He led us through winding alleys to the railway embankment. From there, we looked across the river to the high mountains on the Japanese side. This place was 2,000 meters away from the Japanese artillery. We could see piles of rubble on the embankment, but vehicles still traveled back and forth through the tunnel, directly to Tongguan.

General Zhou led us through the city, which was full of posters. Several acres of land that used to have mud houses were now in ruins. Later, we walked to the city wall near the Yellow River and the Japanese side. Inside the city wall, we met the regimental commander stationed in front and led us to his headquarters. He had built a flower garden in the pile of rubble. The regimental commander led us into an air-raid shelter and invited us to drink tea at a dining table. Fresh flowers were placed on the table and the tables next to it. Then we climbed the city wall from inside the city. When we reached the top, General Zhou told us not to stick our heads out beyond the battlements to prevent the Japanese from seeing us. There were 800 yards between the river and the city wall, and it was at least 1,000 yards to cross the river. We could see the winding trenches of the 16th Army and the location of the machine gun squads.

We walked out of the wide city gate and immediately stepped into the trenches. We walked a little further and met two machine gun squads. The soldiers were all reading books. We stopped to look at the contents of the books, which were mostly elementary readers, starting with an explanation that every good soldier should read. Finally, we had reached the outpost. A few meters ahead was the Yellow River, which formed a large arc here, the famous Ordos Loop.

That was it. The Yellow River flowed on, very calm that day. We went back through Tongguan. On the outskirts of the city, our car miraculously waited there for us and ran a few more miles to see a large artillery position in the village. The gunners were doing their routine work, looking very energetic.

General Zhou and another adjutant rode their horses behind us, and we drove ahead. On the country roads, they could catch up with the car and run alongside us. We let the horses go first to avoid the dust raised by the car. There was a small path between two wheat fields that diverged from the road. The general gave us a final farewell and turned his horse onto the path—back to headquarters. We last saw the short and sturdy General Zhou sitting on a Mongolian warhorse, heading forward for the victory of China (End).

### The Ministry of Food Establishes a Plan to Solve the People's Food Problem; Implementing Production, Consumption, and Storage Plans; Issuing Food Storage Vouchers to Tenant Farmers

Chongqing - Chinese operations have entered their fifth year. China's rice may be insufficient to meet wartime needs, or at least it is extremely difficult to circulate all the rice. Several vital transportation lines have been cut off by the Japanese army. To cope with this problem, the Chinese government has specially decided to establish a Ministry of Food to handle this most important problem in China. The problems that the ministry wants to solve are extremely complex, including the following: (1) There are no reliable statistics on production, consumption, or storage; (2) China's pre-war

Food imports have been cut off; (3) The Yangtze River area up to Yichang is controlled by Japan, and the supply and demand between provinces cannot be mutually adjusted; (4) The devaluation of currency and the relative lack of rice have made rice a target for hoarding and speculation, especially among tenant farmers who receive grain as rent; (5) The government must purchase huge amounts of rice to feed its large army and issue rice subsidies to government employees and low-level officials to supplement their meager wartime salaries. In the two years of 1938 and 1939,

There was a bumper harvest of grains, so the problem was not urgent. But last year's harvest was poor, and this year's hopes are only average, so the problem has gradually become serious. The main attention is now focused on fertile Sichuan, which is the core of China's wartime economy in the un-occupied areas. Therefore, the government appointed Xu Kan as Minister of Food. Xu is a Sichuan native who has served as Director of the Finance Department for many years. When Xu met with a United Press International reporter, he outlined the Ministry of Food's plan to deal with this problem. He stated that the following will

Be implemented: (1) The Ministry of Food will try to facilitate transportation in areas that produce surplus food; (2) It will try to deal with hoarders and speculators and prohibit the wasteful use of grains, such as using them to make wine; (3) The government will teach the public to use other flour foods besides rice, such as wheat, barley, sweet potatoes, and beans; (4) The government will try to purchase all surplus grain (presumably meaning the grain left over after farmers have eaten and kept seed). In this regard, the Ministry of Food plans to encourage the construction of public and

Government warehouses throughout the country to store surplus grain, so as to feed the army and government civil servants. When the market price of food in any area tends to rise sharply, the government can also sell it at a low price to control prices. The authorities estimate that after the implementation of grain tax collection this year, Sichuan alone can collect 6 million piculs of grain (660 million pounds). Food bonds can also obtain the same amount in this province alone. These bonds will be redeemed in equal installments over five years starting in 1943,

And will be paid with the grain obtained from the land tax. Minister Xu frankly admitted that he will encounter difficulties, especially in obtaining surplus grain held by landlords and merchants. They have always been unwilling to sell surplus grain to the government at the prices set by the government, because the prices set by the government are lower than the high prices in the market. However, the two new measures recently promulgated by the government may greatly overcome these difficulties. One is to set the land tax in grain, and the other is to issue

Food bonds, with the government borrowing grain from grain owners, issuing bonds, and promising to repay the grain together with interest in two years. Minister Xu emphasized that the government has established a long-term plan based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's agricultural plan for China. The first point is to liberate tenant farmers. Xu pointed out that although China does not have large landlords with huge wealth like those in Tsarist Russia, there are still

"Middle-class" landlords who collect most of the tenant farmers' produce as rent. For example, in the Chengdu area, tenant farmers must pay 73% of their harvest to the landlords. Xu also stated that since the start of the war, the income of landlords has increased tenfold to twentyfold, resulting in higher rice prices. As a result, what the tenant farmers earn is not enough to make a living. This is the worst impact on China's rural economy and production. The basic program of the Kuomintang should be that those who cultivate the land should own it, but this ideal should be realized step by step. The second part of the government's plan is to adopt modern scientific farming methods to increase agricultural production. The third point is to control surplus grain,

Control distribution, save consumption, and improve transportation. This great plan is now beginning to be implemented concretely. When the order for food bonds was announced, the Chongqing National Public Daily published a commentary, stating that the prestige of the National Government depends on the success of the first resolution to issue food bonds. The newspaper stated, "If there is any corruption in handling this matter, the entire plan will fail. If this plan is implemented properly, it can suppress food prices, ensure that people have enough to eat, and stabilize the currency as a result." (August 8th, United Press International)

### The American Red Cross Continues to Purchase Medicines, Which Will Be Shipped to China Soon; The Medicines are Worth a Total of One Million Dollars; Anti-Malaria Pills Will Be Shipped to Chongqing by Airplane

Washington - Air News - Davis, President of the American Red Cross, stated that the American Red Cross is currently continuing to purchase $1 million worth of medicines to supply to Free China, which will be delivered in the fastest way to meet the urgent needs of the inland provinces and to curb the rampant malaria between the Burmese border and Chongqing. The association has now transported 10 million quinine pills to malaria-prone areas. Davis also stated that 200,000 pills of "Atabrine," a medicine for treating malaria, have been shipped from Hawaii to Chongqing by clipper. The amount of money used by the American Red Cross for relief work in China has exceeded US$3.5 million. (Reported on the 7th)

### Direct Tax Revenue Increases Sharply

Chongqing - Gao Bingfang, Director of the Direct Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, said that China's direct tax revenue has grown during the war and is now on the right track. The profit tax for this year has exceeded one-third of the income tax so far and is expected to double by the end of the year. According to the Sichuan-Kang Direct Tax Department, the income tax budget for the Sichuan-Kang region this year is 65 million yuan, and the actual revenue for the first half of the year was more than 30 million yuan. (August 8th, Havas)

### How to Study Botany (I)

— Yuan Shanzheng

What is Botany?

Plants are collectively called organisms, and together with animals and minerals, they are called natural history. We take plants as the object, use scientific methods to study their morphology, physiology, ecology, and relationship with humans, which is called botany. Because the phenomena in the plant kingdom are very complex, for the convenience of research, it is divided into pure botany and applied botany. Pure botany is further divided into plant morphology (including external morphology, anatomy, cytology, etc.), plant taxonomy, plant physiology, plant ecology, plant distribution, paleobotany, etc. Applied botany is further divided into agricultural botany, industrial botany, forestry, medicinal botany, etc.

(II) Why Study Botany? First, all the food in the world is made from green plants. Food is the substance that creates the body of organisms and provides the energy for work. If there were no green plants in the world, all animals would not be able to survive, and humans would not be able to maintain their lives. We sometimes hear about wind disasters, floods, and droughts in certain places, and we worry about them very much. Now, because unscrupulous merchants hoard rice, our lives are extremely difficult. Isn't this because plants have a close relationship with human life?

Second, the raw materials for clothing, except for silk and wool fabrics made from animals, but ordinary clothing materials are made from plant (cotton and hemp) fibers. Without clothing, the body cannot be protected.

Third, the raw materials for building houses, except for tall Western-style houses, ordinary houses are made from plants. As for indoor appliances, as well as wall coverings and floors, all are made from plants.

Fourth, in terms of transportation, boats, vehicles, and railway sleepers all need to be made from plants.

Fifth, in terms of medicines for treating diseases, 70 to 80% of traditional Chinese medicine is plants, and quinine, angelica, and ephedrine in Western medicine are also extracted from plants. Now people in the East and West are studying our country's medicines, and the amount exported to foreign countries every year is very large. In this situation, the value of plants in medicine can be imagined. Sixth, in front of the courtyard flower beds, planting flowers for viewing, and decorating the scenery in barren mountains and wilderness, plants are the main source.

Seventh, bacteria are a kind of extremely small plant, which is both beneficial and harmful to humans. It is appropriate to study the methods of eliminating and utilizing them to increase the radiation of mankind.

Eighth, our country is based on agriculture, but farmers have no scientific knowledge, adhere to the old ways, and do not know how to improve, resulting in insufficient yields, which is very regrettable. To seek improvement in order to seek the happiness of mankind, we must study botany.

Ninth, many raw materials for industry are taken from plants. If we want to revitalize industry, we must first have sufficient plants that are beneficial to industry.

Tenth, studying various plants, comparing differences, classifying them in an orderly manner, is truly a good material for training humans to know how to use scientific methods.

### Fierce Hurricane Hits Shanghai Yesterday The City in a Rainstorm Tidal Water Inverted Roads All Become Swamps Shipping Interrupted Vehicles Partially Stopped

Yesterday, a storm came with the lunar autumn, and the city was once again in a state of chaos. According to the report of the Xujiahui Observatory, a hurricane originating from the equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean, at a rate of ten miles per hour, passed through the ocean surface of Da Jijishan, one hundred and twenty nautical miles away from here, last night to this morning, and entered the eastern part of Shanghai to the north. The strong winds and rain throughout yesterday were due to the passage of the hurricane's wing, bringing low air pressure. In addition, yesterday coincided with the full moon high tide, and the water inverted. Public vehicles were stopped and entered the factory due to water accumulation on the roads. In terms of shipping, according to the customs warning, it was temporarily interrupted. Fortunately, the center of the wind did not pass through Shanghai, otherwise the harm would have been much greater than this.

Hurricane Invasion Customs Warning

Jianghai Customs received a report from the observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, saying that the hurricane had invaded to 29 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, and the wind was heading northwest. The city was under attack. Upon receiving the report, the customs immediately hoisted a black cross signal on the roof of the clock tower at 7:30 AM, warning ships in the Huangpu River to take precautions. At noon, the customs received another report from the observatory that the hurricane had reached 30 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, and the wind head had reached the city. At 2:00 PM, the customs received another report that the hurricane had reached 30 degrees 00 north latitude and 122 degrees 50 east longitude.

At 11:00 PM last night, this newspaper inquired from the Xujiahui Observatory and learned that the hurricane was hovering between 31 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees 30 minutes east longitude, with a speed between 11.2 miles. Observing this position, the hurricane has swept past Shanghai.

Shipping Interrupted Transportation Blocked

When the customs hoisted the signal warning yesterday morning, traffic on both the east and west banks of the Huangpu River was cut off, and ferries were completely suspended. Only the company's own small boats were still running at risk. All barges and rowing boats were heading to Suzhou Creek for temporary shelter. Yesterday, 11 ships arrived at the port before 10:30 AM, except for the large ship Hualun Yang Kaili (transliteration) transporting coal from the Pailun Islands (Dutch), the rest were small boats running in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. There were no ships for export all day. The Dutch ship Zhibade and Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship, which were scheduled to export, stopped their anchor and will set off after the hurricane passes. The new Beijing ship of Taikoo Company's Beiyang class, which was supposed to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, also did not arrive due to the hurricane.

High Tide Heavy Rain Water Accumulation into Ditches

At noon yesterday, the wind became tighter and tighter, and heavy rain suddenly fell. It was also the full moon high tide. When the tide of the Huangpu River rose, it looked like ten thousand horses galloping, the river was turbulent, and it poured into the road surface all day long, and did not recede. Low-lying areas all became swamps. Zhejiang Road, Sichuan Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Fuzhou Road, Jing'an Temple, Yuyuan Road, Daxilu Road, Difeng Road, and Yidingpan Road in the Public Concession were all flooded with water above the knees. The middle section of Avenue Joffre, Malong Road, Route Sayzoe, Route Paul Henry, and Route Cardinal Baudrillart in the French Concession were also flooded with one foot of water. Passersby walked barefoot and with legs exposed, wading through the water. The situation was extremely embarrassing, and rickshaw pullers were still shouting incessantly, demanding high prices, some as high as six or seven yuan. Other cars, etc., stalled on the street due to the machines being submerged in water, one after another, and the situation was very chaotic. According to this port, frequent floods are not only detrimental to sanitation, but also hinder transportation. The general public is complaining. Although the authorities of the two concessions intend to raise the road surface or improve the ditches, the project is huge and cannot be completed in a short period of time.

### The Two Concessions Started Special Preparedness Last Night Police Officers Prohibited from Taking Leave During the Preparedness Period Non-Essential Roads Will Be Blocked

The police and all defense forces in this port, including the US Marine Corps and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, started special preparedness last night (August 8) to prevent unexpected events during the fourth anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai Battle. It is reported that both concessions will strictly implement the curfew from midnight and strengthen prevention as usual until after August 14th. The police departments of both concessions have canceled police officers' leave during the preparedness period, and all police officers in the Public Concession will be fully equipped from yesterday noon and will be dispatched at any time until midnight on August 14th. Some roads in both concessions will be blocked, and strict defense and inspection will be carried out at the border with the Chinese area. All teams of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will be on standby from Monday to assist the police in maintaining law and order. Chinese residents will commemorate it in a solemn and vigilant spirit due to environmental reasons.

Public Vehicles Partially Stopped

Yesterday, the road surface was too deeply flooded, and public vehicles in the two concessions were almost stopped. The trams in the Public Concession were too dangerous to operate due to the tracks being buried in the water, so they were all stopped and returned to the factory. Although buses barely operated, they shortened the route and did not drive to the flooded area. Trolleybuses, on the other hand, operated as usual. Trams on routes 1, 2, 7, and 10 in the French Concession were also stopped one after another due to the deep water accumulation on Avenue Joffre. Other trolleybuses and buses, although they operated as usual, all returned to the factory early in the evening. If the wind subsides and the water recedes today, all vehicles on all routes can resume normal operation.

Storm Rampages Losses Repeatedly Seen

Yesterday, due to the rampage of the hurricane, many fences or billboards were blown down in the street. The main ones are as follows: (1) The outer bamboo fence of the six-story Wheelock Building, which was built on the original site of the Commodities Exchange at the intersection of Edward Road and Sichuan Road, was blown down by the hurricane at 1:30 PM yesterday. Fortunately, there were few passersby, and no tragedy occurred. However, the pole in Sichuan Road was broken, and the nearby Thames Building and Enterprise Building were cut off from electricity. It was not repaired and restored by the power company until 2:40 PM. (2) At 11:00 AM yesterday, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory's billboard erected on the roof of Deng Zhongxing Hardware Store at the intersection of Henan Road and Edward Road was blown down by the wind, fortunately without injuring anyone, only crushing a rickshaw. (3) At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, a cool shed at Lane 80 of Xieqiao Lane collapsed, without injuring anyone. (4) The large billboard in front of the Yunfei Car Factory at the intersection of Edward Road and Sichuan Road was blown down by the wind, without injuring anyone. (5) Many trees on the roadside in the French Concession were uprooted by the strong wind.

High Tides Continue This Morning and Afternoon

It is found that at 4:30 this morning, the Huangpu River will have another high tide, and its amount is predicted to be 12 feet 6 inches. At that time, the high tide will inevitably land, and the water disaster on the road will be more serious. It is also found that there will be an afternoon tide at 1:50 PM today, and the predicted amount is 10 feet 08 inches 5 points, which is also worthy of attention.

### Chaff Oil Tanker Released by Japan

Continental News reported that according to responsible parties, the Japanese Navy released the US Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker "Meiyao" that it had detained yesterday (July 7) and handed it over to the Jianghai Customs. It is not yet known whether this means that our country has no intention of confiscating the ship or the oil it carries. The Japanese authorities have not yet issued an official statement on this matter. According to the report, "Meiyao" was detained by the Japanese Navy on Monday because it was docked at a certain port on the Yangtze River, which did not match the place name stated in the customs declaration form.

### Supply of Foreign Exchange Outside the Concession Area Ministry of Finance Will Promulgate Measures From Now On, Foreign Exchange Transactions Will Be Concentrated in the Four Banks No One May Engage in Trading Without Special Approval

After the US government issued a special note to the China, Communications, Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China to safeguard China's legitimate foreign trade, the New Voice News reporter learned from the four banks and various Chinese commercial banks yesterday that the Ministry of Finance is formulating concrete measures regarding the import merchants in the Shanghai concession area who need to purchase foreign exchange for importing essential goods, and to safeguard legal trade. It is opened that in the future, foreign exchange transactions will be concentrated in the four banks, and Chinese commercial banks may not engage in foreign exchange business without special approval. Regarding the black market exchange rate in Shanghai, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is ordered to find ways to continue to maintain it, and the people are ordered to practice frugality. All luxury goods and non-essential goods should be saved and wasted for the purpose of national construction.

Temporary Measures of China and Communications Banks

The China and Communications Banks will legally supply legal foreign exchange to import merchants in the free area who are engaged in importing goods that are essential for the country. As for the Shanghai concession area, due to the special circumstances, foreign exchange will be legally supplied for the import of essential goods that are specially approved by the Chinese government. It is also decided that before the order of the Ministry of Finance is received, the import of goods into Shanghai, even if they are essential goods, will be temporarily suspended unless they are specially approved by the government. However, this does not apply to importers who have foreign exchange in the two banks. It is reported that non-essential goods that are prohibited from being imported by the government under 434 tariff numbers must not be requested from China and Communications for foreign exchange.

Chinese Commercial Banks Comply with Orders

In accordance with the provisions of the 60th Note issued by the Central Bank to Chinese commercial banks engaged in foreign exchange, the Central Bank will collect and pay all foreign exchange bought and sold by Chinese merchants before July 26, so that the funds of Chinese commercial banks that have been frozen by the US government can be transferred by the Central Bank and become unfrozen funds, and the settlement must be completed before August 15. In the future, the foreign exchange business of various Chinese commercial banks will be handled in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Finance. Before the order of the Ministry is received, the foreign exchange business, except for those who have foreign exchange positions in Shanghai, must be temporarily suspended.

Allied Banks Continue to Supply

The measures for prohibiting imported goods and the measures for receiving foreign exchange differentials for exported goods previously promulgated by the Ministry of Finance have been ordered by the customs in the free area to be implemented. However, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has never complied with them due to environmental reasons. Luxury goods and non-essential goods can still be imported into Shanghai. It is reported that although these prohibited goods may not apply for foreign exchange from the China and Communications Banks, they can still be purchased from 14 allied banks such as HSBC as of now. Because the allied banks implement freezing, it is not thorough. Therefore, speculation by speculators has not disappeared, and the black market for foreign exchange is still free. The so-called strict review is only in name.

Black Market Foreign Exchange Continues to Be Maintained

The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, after sending American member Fox to Shanghai for inspection, has decided on a method based on the findings of the inspection and will implement it step by step. Regarding the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai, it is decided to continue to maintain it in accordance with the established policy of the Chinese government to maintain the legitimate trade of China and allied merchants. The maintenance method has also been agreed upon with allied banks such as Citibank and HSBC. The New Voice News reporter learned from the foreign exchange market yesterday that the black market was tight yesterday, which was actually caused by speculators taking advantage of the situation. It is reported that the Stabilization Fund will not only try its best to maintain it, but also try to prevent this improper fluctuation in order to stabilize the exchange market and maintain legitimate trade.

### Arrived in the Rain and Wind for Face-to-Face Talks, Given Boundless Sympathy, Demonstrating the Earnestness of Applying for Educational Assistance, and Brightness Must Come from Struggle

The heavy rain and wind shook our hearts, deepened our apologies, and encouraged our spirit of service!

In order to investigate those applying for educational assistance, our colleagues sweated profusely under the scorching sun, fulfilling our duties. Yesterday, we were spared the sun's oppressive heat, but encountered a passing hurricane. The rain and wind seemed to remind us that struggle is essential in life's journey. In addition to personally visiting and investigating, we also sent letters to some applicants whose addresses were difficult to access, inviting them to the office for face-to-face talks. Yesterday, the sudden hurricane arrived, but our letters had already been sent out three days prior. We worried that the weaker students would be attacked by the storm on their way. We were sorry that we couldn't reschedule. After they finished their talks and left the office, our apology remained indelible, and our hearts remained uneasy. If the weather is still like this today, we can and should postpone the appointments for students from afar who have already been scheduled for interviews. On the one hand, we hope that all students can develop a spirit of perseverance, but on the other hand, we believe that it is appropriate to postpone appointments due to special transportation obstacles. We hope that the students who received the interview notices will take note.

The wind and rain are dark, but the rooster crows incessantly; now that we have seen the students, how can we not be delighted.

Yesterday, several students who were scheduled for interviews braved the difficult journey of wind that could not hold an umbrella and streets filled with water, and most of them walked to the office. Therefore, we have to change this ancient poem to "Now that we have seen the students, how can we not be delighted." We firmly believe that this spirit is the factor for your future success in life. We send you off with a mix of joy and guilt, entrusting you with the enthusiasm to wish you a safe journey home, and to preserve it forever.

Our colleagues also ventured out in the wind and rain yesterday to conduct investigations. This is the duty of our colleagues, and we do not want to talk about our investigation process yesterday, but we feel that there are many points worth noting about the students who came to the office yesterday. Sympathy, expectation, and comfort were swirling in our minds.

One thirteen-year-old student, whose father's life was taken in the war, lives with his mother in a small tea house, relying on his mother's knitting of gloves to make a living. They eat two meals of porridge and four large pancakes a day, hungry and unable to afford rice. They borrow tuition every semester, intending to pay it back, but are ultimately unable to do so.

Two siblings applying for educational assistance, whose father teaches at a junior high school, supports a family of ten, and educational expenses. All income is not enough to buy rice, but they firmly believe that without education, their children will have no way to make a living in the future. One twenty-year-old university student, whose father passed away and relies on his sister's service to support the family. He is an outstanding student, earnestly hoping to continue his studies. He solemnly said that the time for him to serve society is gradually approaching, and he will never forget the spirit of educational assistance from people in society.

Two young ladies studying obstetrics, one lost her father at the age of seven, and then her mother. Her younger siblings also died young. She is truly lonely and desolate. She held back her hot tears, gradually lowering her voice, but her spirit of not being decadent and not shrinking can be observed. One's father fled to Yichang after the war, and the whole family was scattered, with no news. She studied in Shanghai before the war, and now her classmates provide her with accommodation. She looks forward to the success of her studies, and at the same time hopes to find her father's whereabouts, which is equally eager.

For the investigation of educational assistance, let the brothers and sisters re-recall your difficult life journey. However, this should not cause your negative scars, but should be your positive encouragement. Hardship always helps those who succeed. Those who degenerate never come from hardship, nor do they know hardship. This is what colleagues want to encourage and comfort everyone. (N)

### High Tides and Heavy Rains Often Cause Flooding in Shanghai; Road Surfaces Sink Year by Year, Greatly Affecting the Situation; Fundamental Remediation Requires Approximately 200 Million Yuan; Speech by the Director of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council at the Rotary Club

Gimson, Director of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, said in a speech at the weekly meeting of the Rotary Club at the Metropole Hotel the other day that Shanghai streets are prone to flooding for two main reasons: high tides twice a month and heavy rains. When heavy rain falls during high tide and the water level rises to the level of the roads, all the streets are easily flooded.

Shanghai Streets Sink Year by Year

Another reason is that the ground sinks by one-third of an inch to one inch, and the sinking is more severe in the western district than in the central district. The sinking of the road surface is estimated using special equipment. In addition, the rise and fall of the tide can be measured to determine the degree of sinking. Taking Cathay Mansion as an example, since the building was completed several years ago, the roads around it have sunk by about five feet.

The Suzhou Creek Has Not Been Dredged, Making it Difficult to Drain Floodwater

In order to remedy the flooding situation, 200 million yuan is required to purchase the necessary equipment and machinery. However, this plan cannot be proposed at present because the administrative organs of the two concessions are unable to raise this huge sum of money. Whenever there is heavy rain, water accumulates on the streets and drains slowly because the water level of the Suzhou Creek rises. Another cause of flooding is that the Suzhou Creek has not been dredged in the past four years, which has greatly hindered the drainage of floodwater.

Hurricanes Passing Through Shanghai Often Cause Flooding

When the hurricane passed through Shanghai in 1935, the streets were flooded, with depths reaching five feet. Sometimes the tide rose, and the water around the Bund and Henan Road area was three feet high, so the roads in this area need to be rebuilt, and one of the sewers should be blocked, allowing only the accumulated water to drain out and not flow in. Ordinary pump methods for draining water from houses have proven to be quite effective.

Prosperous Areas are Especially Difficult to Remedy

However, the roads around the major department stores on Nanjing Road pose a difficult problem. The traffic there is extremely congested, and the tram lines crisscross, making it impossible to raise the road surface, and the sewers cannot be blocked because they are connected to other parts, allowing the water to flow into the sewers. The western district is the most flooded because the authorities in that area did not allow the Public Works Department to work there in previous years. However, after the Shanghai War in 1937, the Public Works Department sent teams to raise the roads in that area.

He was sentenced to two years in prison by the Nagasaki District Court for attempted murder and granted probation. Later, Lin's family members and others filed an appeal, believing that it was premeditated murder. According to the Japanese-language Dalu Xinbao, Lin Xiongji's appeal case was heard at the Nagasaki Court of Appeal at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th of this month.

Therefore, all the iron gates leading to Nanshi have now been opened and restored to their original state. At the same time, the Japanese military police stationed in the refugee area have also withdrawn. It is said that when the Xin Kaihe iron gate had not yet been opened yesterday morning, a large number of women and children were waiting at the iron gate. The Japanese army inspected them in detail. At that time, a woman with a basket full of large pancakes and fried dough sticks, resembling a vendor, was suspected of something and was arrested and taken away by the Japanese soldiers.

### Four Foreign Ships Are Still Detained in Dinghai

In March of this year, the shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang flourished for a time. More than a dozen merchant ships from Germany and Italy competed to sail this route. However, after the Japanese Navy expanded the blockade area in the Zhejiang East Sea, six ships, including the Moufu, Anmanli, and Baolichangde, were detained by the Japanese side in the waters near Dinghai. Except for the Baolichangde, which was escorted back to Shanghai by a Japanese warship, the other four ships, such as the Anmanli and Moufu, are still being detained in the waters of Dinghai. Although the shipping companies have repeatedly requested the consulate to negotiate for their release, it has been four months and there has been no satisfactory result. As for the Baolichangde, which was detained in the Yangshupu River in this city, it was rumored that there was a possibility of release, but this has not been realized so far.

### Strikes Broke Out in Wanhe and Yusheng Rice Shops; Mei Ya No. 9 Factory Also Goes on Slowdown

The labor-capital dispute in the rice shop industry in this city has been resolved for more than a month. Since last month, the rice shops have been fulfilling the agreed terms. However, some minority rice shops have still firmly refused to fulfill them, which has led to another strike. According to a reporter from Dagang News Agency, all the employees of Wanhe Rice Shop at No. 6 Caishi Road and Yusheng Rice Shop at No. 48 on the same road in the French Concession left the shop on the night of the 3rd of this month due to the delay of the capitalists in fulfilling the agreed terms and went on strike again. They also sent a telegram to the capitalists requesting immediate fulfillment of the agreed terms. The situation was still deadlocked as of yesterday. It is learned that the capitalists will send representatives to negotiate with the labor side today. In addition, hundreds of male and female workers in the No. 9 branch of the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory at No. 1001 Xujiahui Road in this city have been on a slowdown since the day before yesterday because their request for the capitalists to improve their treatment was not met. It is learned that the labor side has petitioned the capitalists several times yesterday, requesting sincere negotiations. However, the capitalists ignored them. The labor side will request the French Concession authorities to mediate so that the labor unrest can be resolved as soon as possible.

### The U.S. Consulate General Stipulates Visa Procedures for Chinese People Traveling to the United States; Holders of Official Passports Must Be Approved; Business Travelers, Tourists, and Students Should Have Guarantees

The U.S. Consulate General, in accordance with the instructions of the U.S. government, implemented new visa regulations for traveling to the United States on July 1 in order to adapt to the emergency situation.

### Shenbao Readers Send Donations in the Rain; The Total Exceeds 30,000; Zhejiang Xingye Colleagues Enthusiastically Respond; All Employees of This Newspaper Do Their Best

Yesterday, due to the heavy wind and rain all day, the roads were flooded and difficult to walk on. However, many people who sympathized with the educational assistance fund of this newspaper still sent donations in the rain, and their kindness is admirable. From morning to night yesterday, 25 students were invited to the office for interviews. They did not flinch because of the wind and rain, which increased their spirit of moving forward. They were full of vigor, respectable and lovable. The details are as follows:

Zhejiang Xingye Colleagues Launched Educational Assistance

Since the colleagues of a major bank generously donated 1,000 yuan on the 2nd of this month, it has aroused the interest of the banking industry in enthusiastically helping education. Yesterday, the Zhejiang Xingye Bank Club Group donated 1,000 yuan and raised 400 yuan for Shengcunjie, which is deeply appreciated. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Shenbao Newspaper, In recent years, I have learned that your newspaper has launched a 'Reader Educational Assistance Fund', which I admire very much.

The colleagues of this kind of righteous act dare not lag behind. Now, our department has only donated 1,000 yuan in legal tender and raised 400 yuan for Shengcunjie, totaling 1,400 yuan. Please check and collect them and send two receipts. I hereby inform you and wish you well. Zhejiang Xingye Bank Club."

This Newspaper's Employees Group Assistance Fund

The colleagues of the editorial department of this newspaper recently initiated a group donation, and all the staff and workers unanimously supported it. As of last night, the full amount was collected, totaling 1,706 yuan. However, 647 yuan was donated by 19 people including Mingji, Genggeng, Shuji, and Yaoji, which was sent to the accounting department on the 10th. Therefore, the actual amount received yesterday was 1,059 yuan. The list is omitted.

Donations Yesterday Were Nearly 3,000

Yesterday, the donors were 1,000 yuan from the Zhejiang Xingye Bank Club, 400 yuan raised for Shengcunjie, 1,706 yuan from all the employees of this newspaper (of which 647 yuan has been deducted, so the actual amount received yesterday was 1,059 yuan), 100 yuan from Mr. Li Xiaowen of Fukang Company, 100 yuan from Mr. Zhang Xiangchi, 18 yuan from Mr. Ni Yihe, 16 yuan from an anonymous person, 10 yuan from Ms. Zai Anli, 10 yuan from little sister Chen Peifen's savings from candy, Liu Zufa, Shi Yingen, Zhang Wenbiao, Shi Honggen, Yan Pengfei, and Li Donglin donated 5 yuan each, Wang Baoshan, He Jinzhi, Ding Hansheng, Liu Taixiang, Zhao Changlin, Zhu Genrong, and Miao Shenglin donated 2 yuan each, Li Yunzhang, Gong Lisheng, and Gu Juemin donated 1 yuan each.

Leng Yu is Allowed to Apply Exceptionally After Being Admitted to University

Yesterday, Mr. Su Zhen sent a letter, mentioning two points regarding the application qualifications and deadline. After considering it, the colleagues deeply admire Mr. Su's difficult situation and the reason why he did not apply late. They expressed their full sympathy and decided that if Mr. Su has taken the university entrance examination and can be admitted, he will be allowed to apply exceptionally. As long as the investigation is deemed qualified, he will be assisted. I hope Mr. Su will notify us by letter after being admitted, and provide the detailed mailing address.

### The Robbery Case at the Rend De Sanatorium; The Handbag Contained Morphine

The Rend De Sanatorium at No. 577 Haining Road was invaded by a thief posing as a patient for treatment at around 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. After being diagnosed by the director of the sanatorium, Xi Shimatsu, it was found that the person had no disease. While he was surprised, Wang Huanwu, a broker from Puxiang Pharmaceutical Company of the Museum Road, entered with a bag of medicines. The patient suddenly revealed a hideous face, showed a pistol, robbed the handbag, and fled without a trace. After the case occurred, the police thought that the thief had stayed in the sanatorium for a long time, and the purpose was only to rob a handbag, which seemed not that simple, so they have been conducting a strict investigation. It is now learned that the handbag actually contained a large amount of morphine, so the thief dared to wait patiently to rob it.

### A Quarrel Between Children Resulted in a Homicide; A Jiangbei Woman Ganged Up to Commit the Crime; Xu Shengxian Was Beaten to Death

Xu Shengxian (50 years old), a native of Shaoxing, lived in a bungalow in Jiangjia Lane, Seymour Road. At around 6:00 p.m. on the 6th, because his son had a quarrel with the child of Chen Sunshi, a Jiangbei woman next door, Xu Shengxian went out to intervene. Chen ordered people to knock Xu to the ground, beating him with fists and feet, causing serious injuries to his throat, chest, and abdomen. He was on the verge of death. His wife, Zhu, heard the alarm and came out, and the murderer took the opportunity to escape. As a result, Chen Sunshi was arrested and handed over to the patrolman to be taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. On one side, she hired a car to send her husband Xu Shengxian to the hospital for treatment. He died of his injuries at 10:45 a.m. the next morning. The body was taken to the Jiaozhou Road autopsy center to wait for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Chen Sunshi to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case and asked for a postponement. Questioning Chen Sunshi, she confessed, "I didn't hit him at the time, I just dragged him down, please forgive me." Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that she be remanded in custody and rescheduled to wait for the verification of Xu Shengxian's body before reviewing it.

### Wen Lant亭 and Others Continue to Run the Food Hygiene Association

Wen Lant亭, Shen Yingquan, Ding Fubao and other celebrities in this port have recently continued to run the Food Hygiene Association, advocating vegetarianism. The original letter said, "In the past, Dr. Wu Tingfang set up the Food Hygiene Association to promote vegetarianism, non-smoking, non-drinking, non-gambling, and all daily hygiene. It was quite beneficial to society. Unfortunately, the association's affairs were suspended not long after. It has been more than 20 years now. In recent times, this port has become increasingly extravagant. Usually, every meal is not complete without meat, and banquets are full of delicacies and famous wines, and all kinds of tobacco, to show off wealth and seek temporary pleasure for the appetite. They don't know that eating too much wine and meat will lead to high blood pressure, hardening of blood vessels, and easy kidney and liver diseases. Those who cannot enjoy longevity in the future are caused by this. The poison of cigarettes can cause palpitations, hyperactivity, insomnia, emaciation, memory loss, hardening of blood vessels, and affect the thyroid gland, causing premature aging and premature gray hair, etc., which is harmful and not beneficial. Therefore, when Lant亭 and others heard Dr. Wu's remarks that day, they implemented the Food Hygiene Association's doctrine, and smoking was naturally banned. If the main components of food, such as carbohydrates, protein fats, various vitamins, and minerals, are all obtained from vegetables and fruits, there is no fear of chronic meat poisoning. Therefore, for decades, physical strength and spirit have become stronger, which is not the gift of Dr. Wu's promotion of vegetarianism. Now we intend to solicit comrades to continue running this association. Those who wish to join the association, please send a detailed resume to No. 204 Mei Baige Road, Shanghai, and you will be a member of this association. This association serves the society and promotes public welfare, so no membership fee is charged. The date of the meeting and various printed materials will be notified later after consultation."

### Applications for Student Aid: An On-Site Inquiry Record (3)

Peddlers, Carpenters, and Coppersmiths

Under the bright sunshine of the afternoon, I began my investigation work. Every day, I followed the addresses of numerous student aid applicants, visiting them one by one. After five days, the general conclusion I reached was that poverty is widespread in society. From this, it can be seen that while there are indeed many rich people, there are even more poor people. I hope the rich can help us and assist the poor!

The poor people I found included refugees, coppersmiths, carpenters, peddlers, and more. Moreover, the children of these poor people are all diligent in their studies, achieve excellent grades, and have good character. This is both a commendable and heartbreaking thing. There is a Mr. Zhang, who is from Liuhe. His old home was destroyed by artillery fire. His father initially sold fruit, but is now unemployed. His mother works as a seamstress, residing at a certain address in Cide Lane, Guangxi Road. They have a small space behind a neighbor's house. This tiny space is truly dark and gloomy. Fortunately, their neighbors are kind and occasionally help them with a meal. This situation is truly heartbreaking!

In addition, there is the son of a coppersmith, surnamed Zhou; and the son of a carpenter, surnamed Zhang. These two students are two years apart in age, but they are classmates in the same class, and both live in a wooden workshop on Beihai Road. Their grades are not bad, and their conduct is consistently graded as A. The coppersmith's son said that his father carries his tools out every day, sometimes making a living, and sometimes returning empty-handed. His mother works as a temporary seamstress. The family of three relies on this to survive. While speaking, he repeatedly expressed his grief. The carpenter's son lives in a loft. His 71-year-old father and 16-year-old son also live in this loft. According to the carpenter's son, "He was born in Shanghai. His mother died four months after his birth. His father has been a widower for 16 years, serving his elderly father and raising his son. He had to drop out of school for two years because he has a cough and is in poor health." Based on what he said, this carpenter is truly a filial son and righteous husband! (D)

Hardworking Youth

Yang Guanfu is 19 years old this year and just graduated from junior high school. He plans to enter the Wuxi Guoxue Specialized Academy in the second half of the year, but the entrance exam has not yet arrived. His father is a women's clothing tailor, and his older brother is also learning tailoring in Kowloon. He himself is determined to study. He lost his mother at the age of fifteen, and his father remarried, and has another younger brother. He also has a grandmother. Now, the family of five lives in a narrow and dark back room. His stepmother's kindness is certainly far less than that of his biological mother. Life is so poor, but he studies very diligently. Because of his good grades, the school has granted him a special exemption from tuition fees. In the application form, under the "Brief History" section, he wrote: "I grew up in a rural suburb of Shanghai. I came to Shanghai at the age of twelve and have been studying at Cunde Elementary School. I lost my virtuous mother at the age of fifteen, and the family's financial situation declined, gradually becoming desolate. As for studying in middle school, the school has granted me a special exemption from tuition fees."

When I went to visit him, he was not at home, and no one in his family was there. According to the second landlord, "He is at school and will not be back until evening. His family has returned to their hometown. They are really suffering!" So I left a note for him to come to the newspaper office for an interview. When I returned to the newspaper office, I suddenly received a letter he had sent the day before, saying: "Recently, due to the humble circumstances of my family, and with the rising cost of living, my father's meager salary is not enough to cover expenses, let alone provide surplus funds for my studies. Therefore, I am applying to your newspaper office for student aid. However, it so happened that my father is on summer break (Hongbang tailors have summer and winter breaks), and returned to his hometown last month for a short stay, in order to reduce expenses, leaving me alone in Shanghai. I find it very inconvenient to eat and live by myself, and I am also thinking of returning to my hometown. However, if your newspaper office sends someone to my residence for investigation, I will inevitably miss the visit. Therefore, I am writing to request that your staff inform me in advance of the investigation date, so that I can welcome you. This would be doubly beneficial. I wonder what your opinion is?..." The writing is concise and skillful, and his inner pain overflows from his words. Looking at his grades, he received A's in ten out of thirteen subjects, which is truly rare.

He came to the newspaper office on time. He is a gentle and quiet young man, and his physique does not seem to be very good. His sports score is the worst on his transcript, rated as a C. This is likely due to excessive study. It should be noted. According to him, in junior high school, he was not only exempt from tuition fees, but also received free meals at school. In addition to attending classes, he also managed the school library, so he was able to enjoy the free meals. After the summer vacation, he plans to take the entrance exam for the Wuxi Guoxue Specialized Academy, because he has a special interest in liberal arts, so he wants to continue his specialized study of Chinese classics. The entrance exam has not yet arrived, so I can only wish him good luck in the future, and to notify our newspaper office as soon as he is on the list, so that we can verify and process his application.

Young, studious, hardworking, and resilient, he is truly admirable! However, his body does not seem to be strong enough. This must be due to malnutrition and overwork! (T)

### Destruction of Bandit Nest in the French Concession Town: Details of the Police Investigation. Zhu and Shi were Kidnapped and Treated Extremely Harshly. Swift Action by Detectives Met No Resistance.

According to the Continental News, yesterday (the 7th) at 1:30 PM, detectives from the Central Police Station of the Public Concession, with the assistance of the Shanghai West Special Police, took swift action and captured seventeen kidnappers in the French Concession Town near Columbia Road, rescuing Zhu Chengshan, a foreman from the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau, and Shi Bingzhi, chairman of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company (reportedly a brother of Shi Zhaoji).

Zhu was kidnapped near the Engineering Office on Yanping Road, and Shi was kidnapped at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Jing'an Temple Road. Both men told the police that the bandits had demanded huge ransoms, asking Shi for 600,000 yuan and Zhu for 200,000 yuan. Zhu replied that his family was not wealthy, so the bandits reduced the ransom to 20,000 yuan. The two men also said that the bandits treated them like pigs and dogs, giving them only a bowl of coarse rice a day to eat, and that they had been confined for ten days without being able to stretch their muscles and bones.

Direct Raid on the Bandit Den

Several Western detectives from the Central Police Station, including Detective Gus, went to the French Concession Town in two trucks, divided into two teams, each armed with pistols and a handheld machine gun. They surrounded and raided the two bandit dens, encountering no resistance, and captured all the bandits in one fell swoop. The two rescued victims were handed over to the Shanghai West Special Police and taken back to the Central Police Station in the evening. The bandit gang was handed over to the Special Police for detention for further investigation. According to police sources, the bandit gang had been active for a long time and had committed many kidnappings. The fifty detectives, after breaking up this major bandit gang, returned to the Central Police Station at around 3:00 PM.

Bandit Names

Other named suspects included Li Jincai (40-year-old from Nanjing), Ding Xiangwen (26-year-old from Yangzhou), Xu Jifeng (27-year-old from Jiangbei), Li Hengzhong (32-year-old from Nanjing), Zhou Jiachang (54-year-old from Jiangbei), and seventeen others. It is now heard that the two cases have been traced back to Li Jincai as the originator.

In addition, in the civil suit, Lü should compensate Santai, etc., with 321,000 yuan in national currency. The recovered 20,000+ yuan will be proportionally distributed among Santai, etc. The lawyer for the police station, Ru Baoyi, declared in court that he would waive the right to appeal.

### Storm Causes House Collapse, Injuring People

In Lane 785, Tangshan Road, Hongkou, there is a building that has been in disrepair for many years. Last night at around 8:00 PM, unable to withstand the impact of the storm, the wall of the house suddenly collapsed. Four people living inside were unable to escape and were injured.

### Book Cart and Calligraphy Sale for Charity

Truly a passionate advocate for student aid. The descendant of Ling Gu Ge, who does not reveal their surname, using the pseudonym Ling Gu Ge Zhu, the alias of their ancestor. In recent years, saddened by the times and indignant at the world, with sympathy for aspiring students who often drop out of school due to family pressures. This descendant feels deeply concerned and has generously taken on the responsibility of establishing scholarships to cultivate talent. There are many who establish scholarships in the world. For the most part, it is wealthy merchants and magnates, or funds raised for some kind of memorial. However, this descendant is neither a wealthy merchant nor a magnate, nor do they have a fund. They rent a few rooms, with no servants. An elderly couple who do everything themselves. They go out by foot, eat simple meals. So, where does their scholarship money come from? Their family business is antiques. They use what was inherited from their ancestor, and their lifelong collection, including calligraphy, paintings, bronzes, jade, etc. over five hundred items. They attempted an exhibition and public sale at the Ningbo Fellow Association in early April of this year, with marked prices, and after deducting expenses, all proceeds would be used for scholarships. Unfortunately, the meeting took place during dark and stormy weather, with few viewers. As a result, the actual amount sold was only a quarter of the goal, and all expenses consumed one-sixth of the sales amount. At that time, the number of students who had applied and been approved had reached 26, so they hurriedly ended the process. Some advised them to hold another public exhibition. The descendant sighed and said, "The world is not trustworthy, and things go against one's wishes, only increasing expenses. What is the point?" Chao Deng admires their lofty ideals and introduces them to generous gentlemen. From now on, if someone purchases their collection at a price, they will not only acquire treasures, but also indirectly support scholarships. A win-win situation for both public and private interests. Wouldn't that be wonderful? As for the names of the 26 scholarship recipients, the descendant does not wish to make them public. Those who wish to purchase their paintings can request to see the credentials. The descendant resides at No. 14 Zhonghua Xincun, Xinza Road, second floor. Their collection is stored elsewhere. If you are interested in purchasing, please send a letter first, and they will schedule a visit, or bring the items to you. It is all up to you. Feng Chaoran and Wang Boyuan co-announce.

There was no market for French, German, or Japanese currencies, and other currencies also decreased. In the black market, amidst a buying frenzy of 1.6 to 1.7 million US dollars, both the British exchange rate and the US dollar tightened dramatically. The British exchange rate has broken through the three-penny mark of 0.03125 from May 4th of last year, an unprecedented high price, and approached the three-penny barrier. It tightened from 0.03125 to 0.0284375 at the closing, an unprecedented high price. After the opening, the US dollar initially sold by American banks at 5.0615 yuan, but amidst an alarming buying spree by Japanese banks (disposing of funds frozen in the Far East before the US and British freeze), Sassoon, import companies, and Chinese speculators, it closed at 4.8125 yuan after a decline. HSBC and Citibank small counters have changed their US dollar rates from 5 yuan to 4.75 yuan. Trading was extraordinarily active throughout the day, and the market was in a chaotic state.

A Spree of Hedging

Since the morning, British and American currencies in the interbank market have remained unchanged, with a small increase of 0.023 yuan against the Shanghai exchange rate. All other currencies remained stable. The central bank's official exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening bank selling prices for spot transactions were stable. The British exchange rate was 3.015625 pence and the US dollar was 5.03125 yuan. After the opening, the market showed stability and a tendency to strengthen. American commercial banks showed some willingness to supply, reportedly selling at 5.065 yuan. Importers rushed to hedge, and speculators also competed to buy, leading to a gradual weakening. HSBC's listed rates were revised downward. The silver balancing tax remained at 24.25%. After HSBC's small counter also listed the US dollar at 5 yuan, the price of gold gradually rose sharply. Amidst a double-edged buying spree by Sassoon, Japanese banks, Chinese speculators, and importers, HSBC, Citibank, and other banks, although supplying without fail, tightened the price from 5 yuan to 4.9375 yuan. At noon, banks were doing business with each other at 4.9375 yuan for August, and it was heard that HSBC's small counter US dollar rate had dropped to 4.875 yuan. Therefore, by the noon closing, the US dollar had tightened to 4.90625 yuan, and the British exchange rate had also broken through the three-penny mark, at 2.9375 pence.

Japanese Merchants Also Secretly Covering Positions

In the afternoon, Japanese commercial banks were still secretly covering their short positions very aggressively. Chinese speculators and importers again bought August and September US dollars at 4.875 yuan, causing the market to tighten even more sharply. It was heard that the import exchange rate for American banks had dropped to 4.75 yuan, so before the evening closing, foreign banks were trading with each other at 4.84375 yuan for August. Therefore, at the 3:30 PM closing, the US dollar had tightened to 4.8125 yuan, and the British exchange rate had also tightened to 2.84375 pence. The spot price and the September futures price were the same, with the US dollar tightening by 0.21875 yuan and the British exchange rate softening by 0.171875 pence compared to the previous day's closing.

Limited Transactions but No Market in Hong Kong

Hong Kong, 8th (Friday) - The market opened this morning with stable British and US exchange rates. There were limited transactions but no market for the Shanghai exchange rate, and there were no changes in any of the exchange rates (the Shanghai spot exchange rate closed up to 490 yuan yesterday).

Tianjin: British and American Currencies Both Fall

Tianjin, 8th (Friday) - The market opened sluggish this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate fell 0.03125 to 3.4375 pence. The New York telegraphic transfer rate fell 0.0625 to 5.8125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell 0.5 yuan to 87.25 yuan. The "Joint Note" black market rate was cheap at 7.5 cents, at 55.5 yuan.

### Call Loan Rate Remains at 2%; Overseas Silver Price Stable

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts and bills remained stable. The call loan rate of the Bankers' Association remained unchanged, with both the morning and afternoon markets quoting 2%.

London, 7th - The prices of silver bars for near and far months have remained unchanged, with a stable market situation. The price of US silver has not changed. Both spot and futures prices for Indian silver are stable.

### Outrageous Fiat Currency, Jealous Silver; Gold Price Reaches 900 Yuan

Yesterday, the black market for gold rose wildly, and the uptrend escalated amidst chaotic conditions. The price has soared beyond the 7,000 yuan mark. Everyone is bullish, entirely because foreign currencies (the exchange rate for banks and speculators entered the five-yuan range) and the frenzy to buy up 1.6 to 1.7 million U.S. dollars, and British gold tightened to within three pence. And there was an unprecedented high price, so the Shanghai West Group sold out again and again. Yi Yuan, Yi Feng, Da Feng, Xin Feng, and Yongzhi competed. However, among the gold shops, the Chengji Securities Group, Defu (later came out again) Yida, Chida, Yili, and Yinhang Group such as Hengji and Tianyuan's buying wave, there were more buyers, fewer sellers, so the price rose from 6,848 yuan to 7,100 yuan, and then rose another 230 yuan. The full day trading volume was 150,000 to 160,000 taels, for cash transactions in the morning, Xiangxing, Yongjin, and Chengji were at 100 taels, at a price of 8,600 yuan. Wanfeng's Shun Yuan was at 50 taels for 8,590 yuan. At 10:30, future deliveries skyrocketed, so no price was called out. In the afternoon, Hesheng sold 50 taels of Decheng, and the price had risen to an unprecedented high of 8,800 yuan, and then rose another 230 yuan, resulting in the gold jewelry price rising by 25 yuan, to a price of 900 yuan.

Gold Bars Hit 7,000 Yuan

Since the morning, the opening price for each gold bar (ten taels) at 9:15 am was 6,870 yuan, which was 35 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. The price briefly fell back to 6,860 yuan. Chengji, Yida, Laili, and Jin哄(Hōng) pushed the price to 6,880 yuan, and then it was heard that the U.S. exchange rate tightened. Xin Feng, Yong Da, and Da Feng Yi Feng tried to sell, once falling to 32 yuan, falling to 6,848 yuan, while Defu, Yida, Chengji, and Laili maintained the price at around 6,860 yuan for a long time. It wasn't until after 10:30 that the foreign exchange tightening intensified, and it was heard that banks had less willingness to supply, and investor sentiment improved significantly. Yi Feng, Da Feng, and retail investors also came in to invest, rising by 50 yuan, breaking through 6,900 yuan and reaching 6,915 yuan. At that time, Yi Yuan, Xin Feng, Yong Ding, and Sheng sold to 6,885 yuan. Before long, the U.S. dollar was in the five-yuan range, and Xin Feng Yong returned. Chen Da, Hengji, Chengji, and Defu came to invest again, and sellers were unable to do anything. The price rose by 135 yuan, breaking through 7,000 yuan, reaching 7,020 yuan. Sometimes Yida pulled out, the Shanghai West Group resold to 6,990 yuan, then rose again, and the price was 7,000 yuan at noon. After closing, it then rose to 7,030 yuan. There were those in the buying spree who increased and marked the purchase at 5 and 10 yuan higher, and at 2:00 pm the opening price was 7,040 yuan, which was 40 yuan higher than the noon closing price. It then rose to 7,050 yuan, but Tong Kang, Yong Heng Ji, Yida Laili were sold a little down to 7,010 yuan, but it was difficult to return due to the tightness of the foreign exchange. Not long after, the buying spree was renewed. Dingsheng, Chida, Gong Da Xin Feng, Yong Yili, and Chengji came in. Yida has invested a huge number, causing two flights to reach 7,100 yuan. After Yifeng and Defu's force, it once retraced to 7,040 yuan, and finally in the buying surge market closed at 3:30, 7,065 yuan, which was 230 yuan higher than the previous day. It has been up for four consecutive days, for a total increase of 384 yuan, and is calculated by the 4.8125 ending price of the U.S. dollar in August. It was 7,236 yuan, a margin of 171 yuan. After the closing, Yida Tianyuan and Chengda raised the price to 7,100 yuan. Xin Fengyong listed the sale, with a final price of 7,0923 yuan. The highest and lowest prices of the day were 252 yuan. The spot price of the Cash No. Jinmen brand was 8,850 yuan, and the price was reduced by 200 yuan. There is no market for spot gold.

Gold Jewelry Sells for a High of 900 Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry at the silverware shop, Datong Hang and Xintong Hang, increased by 5 yuan at 10:00 in the morning, to 880 yuan, and increased by 10 yuan at 3:00 in the afternoon, reaching a new high of 900 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan. The repurchase price was reduced by 40 yuan.

### Yarn Flowers - Fluctuations Follow Exchange Rates - Excitement Added to the Dock Market - Short Sellers Eager to Cover Positions... Spot and Futures Prices Jump Wildly in Unison

After fluctuating for two days, the yarn market has now rebounded, with a particularly strong surge this afternoon. This is due to the soaring silver tael price and the shrinking foreign exchange rates, which have boosted market sentiment. However, the major players in the industry have mediocre intentions, as factories are willing to sell. Only securities firms and gold traders are actively involved. Therefore, the morning market remained in a state of consolidation. However, Hong Kong traders have a strong demand for 32-count single yarn, with prices continuing to rise to around 40 yuan. Incoming shipments included 380 bales of Double Horse yarn from foreign firms and 365 bales of Golden Rooster yarn. Furthermore, 16 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai on the 9th, which indicates a generally healthy situation. 20-count Double Horse yarn traded at a high of 1,592 yuan and a low of 1,567 yuan. The afternoon market was volatile, with the silver tael price soaring and both British and American exchange rates shrinking. At the same time, the exchange jumped, causing panic among those with short positions, who rushed to cover. The initial trade was at 1,595 yuan, and in a flash, it jumped 600 yuan beyond the mark to 1,605 yuan, then to 1,618 yuan, and finally to 1,620 yuan. Along the way, those who had made profits sold, bringing the price down to 1,605 yuan. Later, due to favorable news, the price rose again to 1,620 yuan, with the final price being 1,619 yuan.

The morning market for Double Horse yarn was sluggish. The opening price was 1,572 yuan. Rumors circulated that a certain Feng and Co. were selling several hundred bales on behalf of the factory, causing market sentiment to weaken. However, the silver tael price was already showing signs of rising. The market remained lukewarm, hovering between 1,570 and 1,568 yuan for a long time. Customer transactions remained healthy, but market sentiment was difficult to lift. Unexpectedly, around 12:00, news broke that the silver tael price was 7,000 yuan. Short sellers covered their positions, pushing the closing price to 1,592 yuan. A review of the day's trading volume shows that 7,890 bales were traded. The amounts bought by various firms are listed below:

Hong Kong 890, Fellow traders 7,000, Total 7,890

The Double Horse futures market went from stability to a sharp rise, with violent fluctuations. The morning opened with a slight drop in American cotton, causing market sentiment to be unsettled. Although spot yarn was slightly more expensive than yesterday, it did not break out of the consolidation pattern. Therefore, the August futures contract opened with a slightly soft tone. Later, as foreign exchange rates gradually tightened, with both British and American exchange rates tightening to within 5 yuan and 2 ban shi (a fraction of a tael) on the black market, and the price of gold rising, breaking out of 7,000 yuan, yarn market sentiment became excited. Bullish traders frequently added to their positions, and short sellers covered their positions aggressively. The market was filled with buying pressure, creating a sense of impending storm. The August futures contract closed at 157.50, up 7 yuan; the September contract at 1534.00, up 12 yuan; and the October contract at 1547.50, up 11.5 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the sharp rise in spot yarn prices, the trend became even more positive. Speculators rushed to absorb the contracts. The August contract once reached a high of 1480.00, the September contract reached 1554.00, and the October contract reached 1568.00. However, the market weakened in the middle of the day as the gold market retreated. However, the final gains were still substantial, with increases ranging from 18.5 yuan to 28 yuan compared to the previous day. Looking at the futures market, because spot yarn sales were not smooth and the foundation was not yet solid, the main reason for the rise was entirely subject to foreign exchange and gold markets. Therefore, those who are long should still proceed with caution. A table of daily price movements is listed below.

### Speculation Active - Moving into the Cotton Market

The spot cotton situation is trending tight, with the silver tael price soaring and foreign exchange rates shrinking. The yarn market is rising, causing market sentiment to be positive, and the cotton market is increasing accordingly. Trading among industry players is booming, and the concept of price increases is becoming increasingly ingrained.

Another report from Shanghai indicates that trading in imported cotton is quite active, driven by a sharp rise in the silver tael price and a tightening of American exchange rates, which have prompted general speculators and cotton firms to purchase spot goods. Yesterday, the price of Brazilian cotton rose by about 7 or 8 yuan compared to the previous day. However, at the same time, due to the lack of clarity on the Pacific situation and the not very solid position of Shanghai, trading in forward cotton does not seem to be very active.

The New York cotton market is unsettled and uneven. It initially rose due to political news from Washington that the Smith bill to freeze government loans for cotton would be released tomorrow, and due to some short covering. However, it subsequently fell back due to profit-taking by long traders and sales from New Orleans. As a result, closing prices were down 4 or 5 points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market was closed yesterday.

It is predicted that the opening market today will be one rupee lower than yesterday.

### Grain - Imported Rice Thinking of Rising Again

Yesterday, the price of imported rice initially rose and then weakened. The market still showed signs of consolidation. However, large traders and speculators were absorbing the supply, ultimately pushing the price up by about one yuan. The early market opening attracted the attention of large traders in Shanghai West and other areas. Later, due to various rumors in the market, "skinball" traders eager to take advantage of the situation also inquired, and the market price was immediately kicked up. However, the ultimate destination was the absorption of floating surpluses by large traders and speculators. The actual fundamental customers were stagnant, leading to profit-taking by floating traders after the price increase, and a lack of buyers, as well as a rush to sell newly arrived goods. The market then fell, initially rising by 1 or 2 yuan, but ultimately only gaining half a yuan to one yuan. However, small-grained spot rice initially rose from 121 yuan to as high as 123.5 yuan, and then fell slightly to 122.5 yuan at the close. British-Indian rice was as high as 150.05 yuan, but closed at 149.5 yuan, then 147.5 yuan. Second-grade Siamese rice was 140.05 yuan to 140 yuan, and broken rice was 105.5 yuan. Trading volume was approximately 800 to 900 tons, with 23,000 to 24,000 bags of spot rice. The total stock of imported rice in warehouses is approximately 1,214,000 bags.

After stabilizing previously, the price of thick and thin Japonica rice rose yesterday due to limited supply and the rising price of imported rice. Both buyers and sellers had positive sentiment, with sellers holding goods in anticipation of higher prices, and local stores and visiting merchants considering purchasing in anticipation of rising prices. This created a perception of supply shortages, and the prices of both thick and thin Japonica rice immediately increased by 1 or 2 yuan. Early Indica rice from Kai Nan Port was 151.5 yuan, settling at 148 yuan. Original white Japonica rice from Wuxi was 146 yuan. As for the new Japonica rice from Pudong, 16 dan (a unit of weight) arrived yesterday, opening at 157 yuan, and settling at 155 yuan, an increase of one yuan, depending on the quality of the goods.

Glutinous rice also saw brisk sales during this favorable period, and prices generally increased by nearly one yuan. Hong Kong glutinous rice opened at 100 yuan and rose to as high as 125 yuan, settling at 120 yuan. Nuo Cha rice was 114 yuan to 110 yuan, and domestic glutinous rice was 126 to 127 yuan.

The Flour Market Thinking of Moving

Yesterday, the spot flour market turned firmer due to active sales. The flour market had been quite quiet for the past week, due to the small confirmation of unified management of foreign firms and the balanced market supply and demand amid falling rice prices. Golden Dragon flour hovered around 32 yuan, while Fortress flour hovered around 33 yuan, with fluctuations of only 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. As of the closing on the previous day, Golden Dragon flour was 31.9 yuan and Fortress flour was 33.1 yuan, with Golden Dragon flour being relatively lower due to larger inventories. Other brands were consistently stable. At the opening of the market yesterday morning, news suddenly broke of foreign exchange entering the country. In the context of rising prices, sellers immediately adopted a conservative approach, and speculators took the opportunity to move. As a result, trading in various goods gradually became active. Yu Long flour opened at 31.85 yuan, and then rose to 31.9 yuan to 31.95 yuan as rice prices rose. Fortress flour was 33.1 yuan, and the afternoon market increased to 33.2 yuan, a slight increase of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. Bell Tower brand Australian flour, due to insect damage, was still at 33.5 yuan, and Double Eagle brand was at 32.45 yuan, a significant increase. Green Treasure flour was 32.2 to 32.3 yuan but not settled. The total trading volume was 30,000 bags, and the market seemed to be turning around.

The wheat market remains quiet. For the past week, less than 3,000 bags of new wheat have arrived from the suburbs. Although various flour mills have slightly relaxed their purchase prices, there is still no wheat to buy. It is reported that Japanese factories are receiving 200 to 300 bags per day, with prices having been raised to 44 yuan. Chinese factories have also raised their purchase prices to 47.5 yuan, but purchases remain scarce.

### Oil Market - Citing Low Arrivals - Oil Prices Repeatedly Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the edible oil market once again rose sharply, due to the continued sluggish supply and the increasingly thin inventory. Oil merchants deliberately disrupted the market, creating a shortage of oil. As a result, prices were uniformly raised again by 5 to 6 yuan. 1 jian (a unit of measure) of raw Jiaozhou oil was sold at 183.5 yuan, 50 barrels of raw Qingdao oil at 265 yuan, 40 barrels of bean oil at 256.5 yuan, 100 dan (a unit of weight) of Da You bean oil at 204 yuan to 203 yuan, and 500 dan of clear oil at 170 yuan to 170.5 yuan. 300 dan of rapeseed oil from Lide Factory was priced at 165 yuan to 171.5 yuan, 200 dan of rapeseed oil from Yoshida Factory was priced at 169 yuan to 170 yuan, and nearly 1,000 dan of rapeseed oil from Rihua Factory was priced at 163 yuan to 172 yuan.

### Securities - More Internal Debt Sold - Market Meanders Downwards

The unofficial public debt market gradually showed signs of weakness yesterday. Although large traders covered their positions, it was not enough to offset the strong selling pressure. Buyers gradually lost interest, becoming hesitant and gradually selling off their positions. Lottery draw of Class A public bonds will be held today, and yesterday afternoon's market prices reflected the deduction for the lottery winnings. The future of the bond market is likely to be a gradual, curved decline, and it will be difficult to make progress in the short term. Yesterday morning, Gong Mao, Yi Tai, and Xin Fu were all buying Class A bonds. Lian He Hao entered Class C and exited Class A. Chang Ji specialized in exiting Class A. Hong Da exited both Class A and Class C. Lian Yi exited both Class C and Class E. The closing prices at noon were slightly down by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, Heng Kang, Xie Da, and Lian Yi bought in, while Xie Xing Yuan and Zhong Fu Bank sold in greater amounts. The market slightly decreased by 0.1 jiao. As a result, Class A bonds decreased by 2 yuan due to the lottery draw, while the rest decreased by only 0.25 to 0.45 yuan. The total trading volume was only around 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

In stock trading, 100 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 41.1 yuan.

At the Public Industry Association stock market, prices rose and fell sharply as many traders slightly unwound their positions. The market closed slightly firmer. Public bus shares had risen for several days and retreated about one yuan yesterday, closing at 18.7 yuan. Xiang Tai Timber Company shares also closed at the lowest price in almost a week.

Rubber shares were quiet, with only Chen's and Karen Tan shares showing an increase.

### Sugar Market - Sugar Prices Remain Tight

Yesterday, the sugar market remained bullish due to the unconfirmed news that Dutch ships had stopped coming to Shanghai. Futures prices initially softened and then rose, ultimately showing little change. The August 10th contract opened at 107.5 yuan, and then rose to 8 jiao, 5 jiao, and 9 yuan. The August 20th contract initially tightened and then softened, initially at 112 yuan, 12.3 yuan, and then at 11 yuan to 11.7 yuan and 0.3 jiao. Prices from the guild indicate that spot goods are tighter. July arrivals were 210 yuan, 12.5 yuan, 10.5 yuan, up 0.2 yuan. June was 109 yuan, 9.5 yuan, 10 yuan, up 1 yuan. May was 108.5 yuan, 9.5 yuan, up 1.5 yuan. April was 108 yuan, 9 yuan, up 1.7 yuan. Dutch red KD marked sugar, which was offered at 98 yuan the day before but not sold, had risen to 100 yuan yesterday. Tai Koo granulated white B mark sugar was offered at 138 yuan, and HX mark sugar was offered at 115 yuan. On the 9th, 1,000 bags of sugar were shipped to Tianjin.

### Seafood - Fish Skin and Fish Maw are Both Expensive

The inventory of fish skin and fish maw remains scarce recently, and market prices are gradually rising. For example, raw public fish skin is 450 yuan to 360 yuan, white fish skin is 640 yuan to 550 yuan, and mother skin is 420 yuan. Fish maw is particularly expensive, such as long glue being 850 yuan, yellow fish maw hanging slices being 1,250 yuan, yellow slices being 880 yuan, Guang Tu high-quality goods being 3,000 yuan, settling at 2,200 yuan, and moon maw being 1,500 yuan.

### Sugar and Sugar Cane (IV) (Part on China)

— Gao Jiannong

According to the Sugar Frost Manual written by Wang Zhuo of Suining in the Song Dynasty, "During the Dali period of the Tang Dynasty (766-799 AD), there was a monk named Zou, who rode a white donkey to Mount Umbrella, lived in thatched huts in Zhong County (now Sichuan). He needed salt, rice, firewood, vegetables, etc. He would write on a small piece of paper, tie it with a string of money, and leave it for the donkey to carry to the market. People knew it was Zou, took the fair price, hung the goods on the saddle, and let it return. One day, the donkey damaged Huang's sugar cane seedlings at the foot of the mountain. Huang asked Zou for compensation. Zou said, 'You don't know that "sugar can be turned into frost," and the profit can be a thousand times over; I'll tell you how to compensate.' He tried it, and it worked. From then on, the method spread..." From the phrase "sugar can be turned into frost," it is of course refining the coarse sand sugar through a process of frying and condensing; however, the "sugar frost" produced in this way is definitely not the "white granulated sugar" we are now familiar with, because the Sugar Frost Manual immediately notes "light purple is the best, deep amber is next, light yellow is also good, and light white is the lowest." It even cites Su Dongpo's poem to Monk Yuanbao of Suining, "Icy plate of amber, how can it compare to the beauty of sugar frost," which fully indicates that the sugar frost was amber in color, not "light and white like frost" as Li Shizhen said. Although Liang Shaoren of the Qing Dynasty (in Rambling Notes from An Autumn Rain Anemone) saw the Sugar Frost Manual citing Huang Shangu's reply to the magistrate of Zizhou, Yong Xi Changyi, sending sugar frost in the poem "Sending sugar frost from afar, knowing it has flavor, better than Cui's crystal salt," he believed that this referred to white granulated sugar; I believe that this is clearly comparing the "flavor" of sugar to salt, and does not mention the color of the sugar being like crystal salt, so these two lines of poetry cannot be used as evidence that China could already produce white granulated sugar at that time (To be continued)

### An Outline of China's Currency System Reform - Issuance Begins Today -

### The Issue of Vaccination Injections

— Editor

Several readers have submitted articles expressing their opinions on the matter of vaccination injections. Some believe that public health agencies sending people to street corners to give injections is sometimes not in line with hygiene principles. Firstly, disinfection procedures are sometimes not followed, and a single needle is used on several people; secondly, the dosage is questionable; and thirdly, while it is usually given in three doses at a doctor's office, only one dose is given on the street. In addition, the attitude of some white-coated staff is truly off-putting. These are issues that the responsible authorities should try to improve.

Apart from the above points, there is undoubtedly nothing wrong with getting vaccination injections. To protect one's own life and to safeguard public health, everyone who has the opportunity should enjoy the right to get vaccinated!

Today, we are publishing a self-description by a vaccination injector that is both laughable and thought-provoking. This is from a different perspective. In addition to one's own viewpoint, being able to put oneself in someone else's shoes and observe society from their position can often give us many new insights and lessons.

Profession

### I am Only a Vaccination Injector

— Hidden

For two years, I have been clearly disappointed with my position. I went to do the work of "serving society" and "benefiting the people" with a full of enthusiastic emotion, but I was met with malicious abuse. This cannot but make me feel heartbroken.

Every time I put on the thick white coat and stand at the crossroads, I gently say to passers-by as they approach, "Friend, come and get a shot, it's for your own health."

"Bah! Who wants it." Many sharp, piercing, and ruthless mouths answer in this way.

I can't help but hang beads of sweat on my forehead, standing there reluctantly. When bored, I look longingly at the azure sky, "Alas! Are people really so ignorant and cruel?" I mutter to myself, and a layer of gloom covers my soul.

"This job, despised by coolies and looked down upon by gentlemen, how can I endure it?" Every time I am mocked, ridiculed, and abused by passers-by, I am so angry that I even prepare to resign. But in order to live, I have to walk onto my execution ground -- the crossroads -- like a criminal.

Friend, you see, because of poor work, the Director, touching his "eight-character mustache" and speaking fluent French, scolds, no, simply insults me.

"...Chinese people are ignorant, stupid, and don't know what's good for them. Persuasion is ineffective, it should be forced, yes, treat the Chinese as..."

Ah! How can I go on? I am also a Chinese person with spirit, blood, and conscience.

After that, a Russian helper was added to every two groups.

With their strong, hairy hands, they dragged passers-by over like grabbing chickens. Then those who could escape escaped, those who could run ran, creating a noisy mess. What was originally "a deserted place" is now crowded around a small square table.

Every time after people have received the injection, they shoot me a fierce look. They vent the anger they have suffered from the "Russian Devil" onto me like bee stings: "Hey! I recognize you."

"Yi! What for? Friend, this is for your own health." I tirelessly explain again and again, dozens of times.

"Bastard! Traitor! A lackey of national ruin! What kind of death injection are you giving, heartless, × what, it makes my arm ache and I have chills at night."

"Chills are a reaction, there is no harm; temporary soreness can guarantee your life." I explain again like a missionary.

"！Hey, nonsense, who asked you to hit me? Death is my own death, what does it have to do with you? I don't want you kneeling on the ground, nor do I want you to wear mourning clothes." People reveal gold-rimmed teeth and grin hideously.

I wipe the spittle on my face and answer patiently, "Friend, but this is infectious! For example: if you die from the plague, your family and the neighbors around you will be threatened by germs. If they have not been vaccinated, they will follow in your footsteps!"

"Bah! Don't jinx me."

"Jackson, don't bother with them." The Russian devil shouts impatiently, pushing, squeezing, dragging, and pulling people madly.

"Hey! Bastard! Lackey!" Thousands of fierce eyes are fixed on me, ah! My soul sinks into a sea of bitterness.

Friend, I am not the lackey you imagine, I am a Chinese person with spirit, blood, and conscience. We are standing on the same front. But getting vaccinated is ultimately for your own health. (Moved to scholarship fund)

Invention

### Daily Changing Inventions

— Yan Fu

Since the outbreak of the war, Britain has had thousands of new inventions, many of which are practical and beneficial to mankind. There are also many new inventions in the United States. However, among their new inventions, some are certainly very useful, while others are quite laughable. Here are a few that have already been patented:

(1) Eyeglasses without lenses

Eleventh Night Singing

Wasn't she thinking that her father would immediately ask her to go to the city? When she went, she would inevitably have to hand over her school meal expenses. At that time, it would absolutely be no problem to divide five or ten yuan from this amount to give to Shang Laoer; and at the same time, she thought: Shang Laoer only taught her acting for half a month, at most give him ten yuan, and she can get over this thing, right?

"Let's do it this way!" She decided to no longer care about what Qiu Haitang was saying to Sister Meng outside, and would apologize to her in the evening.

It wasn't until the seventh time that she opened the lid again that the dozen or so cakes were finally steamed. At the same time, she realized that she had put too much water in the pot, which is why it took so long to cook. She hurriedly put four cakes on a small plate, poured a cup of hot tea early, and carried it out on a tray.

"What? Sister Meng has already left?" As soon as she came out, she saw her father sitting alone in the main room, with his head hanging down, as if he had a lot on his mind.

"Gone."

"Did you tell her I'm not going to learn acting? Did she have anything to say?" Mei Bao put the cakes and tea on a table near Qiu Haitang as she asked anxiously.

Qiu Haitang only picked up the hot tea and took a sip, not paying attention to the cakes.

"I told her." He replied listlessly, "How can this thing still be put off? She went back after hearing what I said."

When Mei Bao heard this, she thought that things were over, and a smile of relief could not help but appear on her face. (180)

### Two-Way Double-Layer Small Tea Table

— Ke Zhong

In modern family life, due to limited space, it is necessary to find ways to utilize various pieces of furniture, with simplicity and economy as the principle. Therefore, various countries in Europe and America have already invented sofa beds and wall beds. The former can be used as a sofa during the day and converted into a bed at night, while the latter is embedded in the wall, which is extremely beneficial for saving space. Recently, someone invented a type of double-layer small tea table, with the upper layer made of mirror, which can be used as a tea table in peacetime, placing cups, plates and vases, but when necessary, it can be transformed into a dressing table, which is also a new and imaginative invention.

All of these new inventions have been sent to the US market; each inventor is hoping to make a fortune from his inventions. What will happen, of course, remains to be seen, but it is beyond doubt that some of them will be able to earn one hundred and eighty thousand immediately. Seeing that there are so many new inventions, how should we feel?

### Listening to Music on Summer Nights

— Gu Xin

In the half-year I've been in Shanghai, I've attended quite a few concerts. I have a friend who is a "concert connoisseur" who takes me to every concert. From February to now, I have listened to nearly forty concerts of different natures. Among them were symphonic, piano, string ensemble, Chinese classical music, and solo vocal performances of various kinds; but perhaps because of my bad mood, I often didn't have the patience to listen to the entire concert. Some performances were not very good, and some of the selections were terrible; since facing reality was out of the question, even the "pure music" failed to make one forget reality because the performances were not "divine" enough, so I often pulled my "music expert" friend away.

Recently, there was an exception. It was when I happened to see a news item about the Experimental Music Society in the newspaper: even my "music expert" friend didn't pay much attention to this news, implying that it wasn't worth listening to. However, that night I secretly went alone to the Russian Art Theater to try listening to the concert that my "music expert" friend didn't care about. The weather that day was so hot, it was like taking a steam bath. When the chorus appeared on stage, performing the "Dunayevsky Collection," I realized that almost half of the program had already been played.

The songs were all familiar, but I hadn't heard them in a long time; this string of pearl-like songs seemed to summon back my soul and restore my lost memories.

I thought I was the only appreciative listener in the audience, planning to be the first to applaud when the "Motherland Song" ended, but the applause of the entire audience erupted, and I couldn't hear my own existence. A stranger sitting next to me looked at me with kind, brotherly eyes and said, "Good—really good!" I noticed that his whole body and forehead were covered in sweat, and only then did I realize that I, too, had forgotten the weather.

After the intermission, I went back into the theater to be "baptized"; the works were all very lively and fresh, and the last three choruses were all good. The most unforgettable were the painting-like "From Border to Border" and "The Song of the Sower."

After the concert, I talked with the friend next to me, who expressed to me in the Changzhou accent of Mandarin that he was one of the "Shiyin fans" (fans of the Experimental Music Society). I asked him why they don't do regular and popular performances? The current seat prices seem too high. He said, "Then let's write a letter to request a popular performance."

### Miscellaneous Notes on Drama and Art

— Fen Yu

Kun Dan (female role in Peking opera) Zheng Bingru, after stopping her performances at the Golden Grand Theater, had intended to film a "Yu Tang Chun" movie for the recently established Lianxin Film Company, but unfortunately, the director Fei Mu fell ill. Her father could not stay in Shanghai to oversee the project, so due to time constraints, this plan may be abandoned. Lianxin prepared a capital of sixty thousand yuan to shoot this film.

"Gong Wu Tai" (Common Stage) is performing their first show, but the results are poor, so they are already preparing to rehearse the second one. It is said that there is a song in the second show, and they are currently asking a musician to compose it, planning to record it and send it to various radio stations that don't charge money to broadcast it.

The "Cowherd and Weaver Girl" play edited by Wei Ruhui is scheduled to be performed by the Shanghai Drama and Art Society at the Lafei Theater on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. Rehearsals have already begun. Because this play is a spoken drama with mechanical scenery, Wei Jun has specially invited the famous actor Zhang Yipeng to be the consultant to guide everything.

The Tianchan Stage last night, due to the sudden rainstorm that enveloped the entire city, the area in front of the stage became a swamp, and they temporarily announced the suspension of the performance. Other theaters opened as usual.

### Zhang Huichong to Direct a Martial Arts Film

— Hu Gu

Zhang Huichong, who starred in "Silver Spear Bandit" for Guolian, is said to be directing a film for Guolian after completing this film. According to a reporter yesterday, Zhang Huichong signed a contract with Guolian the day before yesterday to direct "A Body Full of Courage" and also star in it.

According to Zhang Huichong to the reporter: "A Body Full of Courage" is scheduled to start filming on the 15th of this month. In addition to him playing the male lead, the female lead will be selected from Gong Qiuxia or Zhang Fan. In addition, the co-stars include Wang Xianzai, Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, and others.

It is said that in "A Body Full of Courage," there will be a new face on the screen, Miss Wu Ming, a student from the Modern Film and Drama School. She was introduced to Huichong by a friend, who believes that she meets the conditions for the screen, so he agreed to give her an important supporting role. It is expected that this martial arts film will be much more advanced than previous ones.

Brief News (1) "Female Zombie" is the debut work of the new director Mei Qian of Yihua.

(29) Gai Jiaotian

Gai Jiaotian, also known as Gai Jiao Yi, is fifth in his family, surnamed Zhang, given name Yingjie. He initially studied Laosheng (old male role), but his voice deteriorated, so he switched to Wusheng (martial male role), and became famous for his short-play martial arts performances. His agility and speed were unmatched by his peers. Moreover, he had a great understanding of rhythm, so when the wind and rain were at their most intense, he would perfectly match the drumbeats, with no deviation whatsoever. His strictness and compactness were unmatched. Some say that Gai Jiaotian actually learned from Li Chunlai, but this statement is probably not entirely true. Both are famous for short-play martial arts performances, so they happen to be similar. To say that his origin is from Chunlai, Gai Jiaotian may not be willing to accept it. Moreover, the plays of "Li" and "Gai" each have their own extremes, so why distinguish between their relative merits? In addition to new plays, Gai Jiaotian adheres to the rules and regulations when performing old plays, such as wearing a small hat with sparse tassels and not applying powder to his face. This alone is enough to make the martial male roles of the Beijing opera circle feel embarrassed. The existence of such a person in the Jiangwai school (outside of Beijing) adds a lot of color to it. He is also diligent in practicing, without regard for the cold or heat, never stopping even for a day. It is rare to see an actor so dedicated, even in his old age. The return of his great fame is by no means accidental. The year before last, he injured his foot while performing "Wu Song" at the Grand Theater, so he often avoids performing techniques such as "spinners" and "splits." However, everything can still make people satisfied, and there is no sense of regret. I can say without hesitation that he is the only one in the Jiangwai school!

### Twin Flowers of Blood

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan and Xiao An Jiao Luoqi

The old man rubbed his old eyes and nodded, saying, "So you are Yuan Yuan! I have long heard of your beauty in Beijing, and I am very fortunate to be able to witness your celestial beauty today." After the old man finished speaking, he laughed heartily. The crowd echoed his laughter. Yuan Yuan couldn't help but shudder at the sound of laughter. The writer Xiyu also felt that something was amiss when he saw these people. Indeed, Yuan Yuan's beauty was too attractive. So, he took her jade arm and hurried back along the mountainside path. Yuan Yuan vaguely saw the flower butterfly gesticulating and talking to the old man. The two hurried to where the mountain sedan chair was parked. Yuan Yuan said to the writer, "Didn't you see? Just now, a group of people were staring at me with burning eyes. I don't know where that old man came from. Judging from his aura, he is very noble and must be a high-ranking official. And there is a frivolous young man among them, that flower butterfly. You know that this person has hated me very much lately!" The writer frowned immediately upon hearing this and said, "Flower butterfly, I have seen him once too. I know that this person has ill intentions towards you." Yuan Yuan said, "Yes, that's why we moved our family to Hengtang, because of him." The writer looked to the east and saw that the group of people was at the edge of the Xiangxie corridor, seemingly about to come this way. So, he said, "Let's go back to the boat." So, the two sat on the mountain sedan chair and asked the villagers carrying the sedan chair to carry them back to the boat. When they went down the mountain, they saw many carriages and horses parked at the foot of the mountain, as well as many guards and attendants. Only then did they realize that the old man touring the mountain was indeed a noble person with a great background. They also saw the Suzhou prefect arriving in a sedan chair, and they guessed that he was going up the mountain to serve the noble person. The two quickly returned to the boat and instructed the boatman to return. It was already Shen Shi (3-5 PM), and the red sun had not yet set over the mountains. The river waves reflected the sunlight, glittering with a golden color. Where there was no sunlight, it was as clear and blue as autumn silk, as picturesque as a painting. A duck boat was rocking towards them, with a large group of ducks floating on the water in an orderly fashion, quacking incessantly. The writer pointed to Yuan Yuan and said, "The ducks are the first to know when the spring river warms, how lovely and picturesque this group of ducks is." Yuan Yuan smiled and said, "Not only is it picturesque, but it is also full of poetic sentiment." (137)
