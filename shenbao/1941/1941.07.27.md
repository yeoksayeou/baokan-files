### Parallel Measures Taken by the United States and Britain: Announcement of Freezing Japanese Funds as an Initial Retaliation for Japan's Invasion of Vietnam; Chinese Funds Also Frozen Upon Request

Washington, 26th (United Press) – Last night, President Roosevelt issued an executive order to freeze all Japanese funds in the United States, effective Saturday. Officials believe this is an initial economic strike in retaliation for Japan's aggression in Vietnam. At the same time, President Roosevelt, at the special request of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, froze all Chinese funds in the United States as a "continuation of the government's policy of protecting China." This announcement of the freeze was issued simultaneously in Washington and Hyde Park. President Roosevelt is currently spending his weekend in Hyde Park. The Treasury Department immediately issued general notices, the first of which aims to avoid the interruption of commerce between Hawaii and the Philippines and between China and Japan. One of the general notices was given to four banks in Hawaii and six banks in the Philippines. Another notice authorizes any Chinese or Japanese merchants in the Philippines to engage in normal commercial transactions in the Philippines. Another special notice grants fourteen major banks the right to conduct business within China, authorizing these banks to provide financial assistance for import and export trade between any part of China (excluding Manchuria) and the United States, Latin America, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. Officials said that China is also included in the freezing order to avoid the misuse of any Japanese-controlled funds during the war and to counteract any Chinese currency issued by Japanese-controlled governments. Well-informed circles expect that Japanese businesses in Latin America will soon be added to President Roosevelt's blacklist. Although this freezing order is almost equivalent to an embargo, it is understood that a general embargo, or one that only includes gasoline and similar items, may be implemented soon. The fourteen banks are Chase Bank, Citibank, Allied Bank, American Express Bank, Tong Ji Long, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Old Sassoon & Sons, New Sassoon & Sons and Bank, Mercantile Bank, Netherlands Bank, Moscow National Bank, and Nederlandsche Handel Maatschappij.

Tokyo, 26th (United Press) – The U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, presumably carrying President Roosevelt's order to freeze Japanese funds. In the afternoon, Grew also visited the British Ambassador and the Australian Minister.

Washington, 26th (United Press) – President Roosevelt will proceed cautiously when implementing the order to freeze Japanese funds and will give considerable consideration to the Japanese, it is said. In fact, officials here are implying that Japan is being put to the test. If Japan can maintain the status quo in the Pacific, it will receive reasonable treatment, it is said.

Washington, 26th (United Press) – Officials here declared yesterday that the freezing order applies to all private funds owned by Japanese individuals, organizations, and companies.

Washington, 26th (United Press) – The Treasury Department last night extended the rights under the general notice issued under President Roosevelt's order to freeze Japanese funds to Hong Kong, "considering Hong Kong as part of China."

London, 26th (United Press) – The British Foreign Office announced this morning that all Japanese assets in the British Empire would be frozen, effective this morning. The Foreign Office stated that all treasuries of the British Empire governments have been prohibited from engaging in transactions involving Japanese gold bullion and securities.

London, 26th (United Press) – Due to Japan's actions in French Indochina, all British colonies have agreed to fully participate in the joint retaliatory measures against Japan by Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. It is expected here that the government will soon announce that the entire British Empire and the United States are united in taking economic and commercial sanctions against Japan. The freezing of Japanese funds by the United States and the British Empire, along with the previously reported broad consultation system on trade with Japan, is virtually a complete embargo on commerce with Japan. Until now, Japan has almost completely obtained regular imports from the British Empire, which are expected to cease in the future. This joint sanction will deal a fatal blow to Japan's main exports, including its annual export of 500 million yuan of raw silk, most of which is sold to the United States, and 400 million yuan of marked goods to China and Manchuria, with the British Empire being the main market.

U.S. Forces in Hawaii and the Philippines Have Taken Precautionary Measures

New York, 26th (United Press) – The United States, Britain, and the British Empire jointly froze Japanese funds in those countries last night and this morning as a retaliation against Japan, thereby further straining relations in the Pacific. This decisive action is a retaliation against Japan's establishment of air and naval bases in southern Vietnam. Although this severe economic action is not expected to trigger an armed conflict between the British-American bloc and Japan, qualified observers believe that this concerted action is the most serious blow Japan has suffered since it began ravaging China in 1932.

San Francisco, 26th (Reuters) – Forty-five Japanese ships, originally intended to sail to the United States, suddenly left the Pacific coast after Undersecretary of State Welles issued a statement condemning Japan as an aggressor. They have not responded to radio communications to date. The Tatsuta Maru was discovered a few miles from the Golden Gate, but its current whereabouts are unknown. It is believed that the ship is either sailing to Mexico or waiting for refueling in the ocean, as a Japanese oil tanker sailed back to Japan from here on Thursday night. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) still announces that the Tatsuta Maru is scheduled to arrive here at 8:00 AM on Saturday. At the same time, two Japanese freighters, originally intended to sail from Yokohama to the United States, have been canceled. Japanese ships in the United States are now rushing to load cargo, hoping to leave as soon as possible. Capitals of the United States, Britain, and France believe that this order to freeze funds is only the beginning of a series of coordinated strikes aimed at crippling the Japanese economy. A complete embargo on exports to Japan by the British Empire and the United States, as well as a boycott of Japanese ships, is gradually becoming apparent. The United States has also ordered the freezing of Chinese funds in the United States, but this measure was specifically implemented at the request of General Chiang Kai-shek to prevent Japanese in the occupied areas of China from transferring their funds to Chinese accounts. At the same time, the United States has ordered all U.S. troops stationed in Hawaii to immediately adopt a state of training and precautionary measures in preparation for any retaliatory actions planned by Japan, which greatly threatens U.S. territories in the Pacific. Troops on the Hawaiian Islands have immediately deployed to multiple locations on the islands and installed anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese Privy Council will convene an extraordinary meeting next Monday to discuss "important and urgent matters." Japanese officials remain silent on the freezing order, awaiting notification from the countries concerned, while simultaneously taking the opportunity to shift the focus of attention to the Far East situation and announce that Japan and France have concluded an agreement for joint defense of Vietnam. This matter was already known to the world a few days ago. This agreement involves Japan's entry into naval and air bases in southern Vietnam, thereby completely controlling Vietnam, as northern Vietnam is already under Japanese protection.

Hyde Park, 26th (United Press Urgent) – President Roosevelt today ordered the incorporation of the Philippine land and sea forces into the U.S. military to respond to emergency situations.

If Japan Invades the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines, the United States Will Likely Intervene Militarily

Washington, 26th (United Press) – A United Press reporter learned yesterday from diplomatic circles that if Japan wants to occupy French Indochina without conflicting with other interested powers, it cannot do so safely. The so-called interested powers refer to Britain and the United States. Regarding the issue of economic retaliation against Japan, diplomatic circles stated that as soon as officials learn that Japan has formally begun occupying Vietnam, economic retaliation will be implemented immediately. On the other hand, some hope that this economic retaliation can be implemented within this week, while others firmly believe that the United States will eventually create a dangerous situation in the world. Roosevelt also stated that the public believes that the United States should act quickly in this crisis, adding that, unfortunately, the American people do not yet fully understand the danger of the situation. Roosevelt pointed out that the American people's lack of understanding of the Far East crisis is far greater than that of the Western Front. The President declined to discuss what actions would be taken today but said that he was confident that Washington would take action against the situation today. Observers have no doubt that the government will implement a freeze on Japanese funds, and it seems very clear that President Roosevelt is determined to proceed cautiously. The freezing of funds seems to be the first step in a series of countermeasures.

Britain Is Fully Supporting the United States, Washington Expresses Great Welcome

Washington, 26th (Reuters) – While negotiations are being conducted under the threat of Japanese naval guns aimed at Saigon, arrangements for U.S. action are quietly being made here. The news from London that Britain is willing to fully support the United States is welcomed here. Generally, it is believed that a new U.S. policy is being planned, and this policy will certainly not be welcomed by Japan. It is felt that if the U.S. policy toward Japan does not change, President Roosevelt would never publicly explain the reasons why he allowed U.S. oil to be shipped to Japan over the past two years. The remarks made yesterday by Undersecretary of State Welles regarding the interests of U.S. national defense can be seen as the prelude to a major upheaval in the Pacific if Japan does not change course. American newspapers today continue to unanimously demand strong action. The Washington Post, in reading Welles' warning, pointed to it as a prelude to U.S. action. Japan, like Hitler, will continue its aggression without end. The United States cannot sit idly by and watch it occupy Vietnam without protest. It is now time to implement economic and financial sanctions against Japan, it said. The Baltimore Sun stated that the danger faced by Britain in Singapore is also the danger faced by the United States. The United States must resist Japan and prepare for any necessary actions, it said. The New York Times stated that the appearance of Japanese warships off the coast of Vietnam should be a sign that U.S. policy must change because Japan has engaged in new aggression that endangers U.S. interests, and the United States no longer has reason to delay its effective sanctions, it said. It is widely believed that various U.S. government departments are now discussing the possible actions mentioned above, namely: (1) banning oil shipments, (2) suspending gold purchases, (3) freezing Japanese assets in the United States, (4) expelling Japanese consular personnel, and (5) detaining Japanese ships in the United States. Some or all of the above actions will be implemented once Japan begins to enter Vietnam. Freezing Japanese funds or taking further strong measures, such as a complete embargo on all oil to Japan, will be accompanied by the same and parallel measures taken by Britain and its territories, such as Australia. Diplomatic circles believe that the motive for this measure is to warn Tokyo not to further invade the Dutch East Indies by force. U.S. lawmakers are divided on the question of whether the United States should take military action against Japan or only explore economic retaliation. A senior senator who is a member of a foreign affairs committee stated that unless Japan invades the Philippines, the United States is unlikely to use force against Japan. He said that the United States does not have a good base in the Dutch East Indies, and the strength of British and Indian forces seems insufficient. However, another senator believes that if Japan invades the Dutch East Indies, the United States will likely intervene militarily. The U.S. Army and Navy already have a genuine understanding of the Far East situation and have complete confidence in defeating Japan. He also said, "If Japan occupies the Dutch East Indies, the United States will find it economically and strategically intolerable." He also stated that military estimates indicate that if the United States obtains an air base in Vladivostok, 250 aircraft could bomb all major Japanese cities, which have never experienced air raids and are therefore practically "completely undefended" in terms of air defense. He also pointed out that from an economic point of view, the United States is almost entirely dependent on the Dutch East Indies for its production of tungsten and rubber. From a strategic point of view, Japan's occupation of the Dutch East Indies would give it a superior position to invade the Philippines. If the United States is unwilling to give up its interests in the Philippines, Japan's invasion of the Dutch East Indies would be intolerable.

Hyde Park, 26th (United Press) – President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the United States will take the first step today to prevent Japan's aggressive actions in the Far East. The President stated that Japan's actions in Vietnam have reminded the United States of the urgency of the international situation it faces. Therefore, the first step will be an executive order freezing Japanese funds in the United States. This step is the same as freezing the funds of Germany, Italy, and the Axis aggressor nations in Europe. Roosevelt also stated that the events in the Far East, namely Japan's deployment of troops to Vietnam, where the Straits Colonies and the supply lines for Great Britain are threatened, have made the American public feel the full severity of the

Tokyo Announced Retaliation Yesterday: Freezing U.S. and British Assets

Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) – Japan has frozen U.S. and British assets in Japan today in retaliation. The Ministry of Finance announced that transactions involving the people of the United States and the Philippines will require special permits.

Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) – Finance Minister Ogura made a statement this afternoon, saying that the U.S. freezing of Japanese assets will not have much impact, and assured the country that the government had anticipated this U.S. action and has made full preparations. Japan's remaining assets in the United States are few, and trade between Japan and the United States has recently decreased due to the tightening of U.S. export restrictions. Therefore, the economic impact of this U.S. move on Japan will be relatively small. The Japanese government will take appropriate steps as needed, he said.

Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) – Semi-official Japanese sources said that President Roosevelt's order to freeze Japanese assets is intended to prevent Japan from building an East Asian order because the order was issued on the eve of the conclusion of the Japan-France agreement to jointly defend Vietnam. Because the issuance of the freezing order contains a political plot against Japan, the scope and intensity of its implementation are difficult to predict. However, this order will not only affect the Japanese assets that are directly frozen but will also affect Japan's commercial transactions with the United States, Latin American countries, and the British Empire, all of which have taken parallel actions with the United States against Japan to date. According to observers, Japan has long been prepared, saying that the Japanese government has taken all possible countermeasures in advance against the widespread rumors of U.S. economic pressure on Japan, especially after the U.S. President ordered the freezing of German and Italian assets in the United States on June 14 this year.

### Japanese Ships Halt Sailings to the United States

San Francisco, 26th (Reuters) – Forty-five Japanese ships, originally intended to sail to the United States, suddenly left the Pacific coast after Undersecretary of State Welles issued a statement condemning Japan as an aggressor. They have not responded to radio communications to date. The Tatsuta Maru was discovered a few miles from the Golden Gate, but its current whereabouts are unknown.

Japanese ships in the United States are now rushing to load cargo, hoping to leave as soon as possible.

### I. Freezing Funds and the Chinese Economy

The news that President Roosevelt announced the freezing of all Chinese and Japanese funds in the United States, and that the British and Canadian governments announced the freezing of all Japanese funds within the British Empire, came like a bolt from the blue. The people of Shanghai were undoubtedly greatly shocked and lived in constant fear. What the general public fears most is that prices will tend to rise sharply, and that life will inevitably suffer the most brutal oppression! This is understandable for those who are easily frightened, but this is a unique phenomenon in Shanghai that should not be ignored. Why do we say this? Please let us explain.

In the past few dozen hours, hearsay has been full of the poison of terror, which is the ghostly trick of speculators. The enlightened have long seen through it, but the common people, because they have not seen correct discussions, are often fooled by them and easily fall into their trap. In the past, whenever there were major reforms, there were always similar phenomena. Those whose economic foundation is built on speculation have no way to correct it. Who knew that today's freezing of funds is not only harmless to people's livelihood, but also the most effective countermeasure to save people's livelihood? At this time of helplessness, it is actually the most commendable facility in our country's history and should be welcomed and supported by the people of the whole country.

First, let's talk about the foreign exchange market in Shanghai. Because the supply of U.S. dollars cannot be as free as in the past, the entire foreign exchange market seems to be affected by its constraints and fall into a state of stagnation. On the surface, this statement seems reasonable. But judging from reality, it is very wrong. Although the United States does not freely supply unlimited U.S. dollars to China and Japan, it must continue to supply other democratic countries or democratic regions. Therefore, speculators in China and Japan can still engage in indirect foreign exchange transactions with speculators in other democratic countries and realize their market arbitrage. In addition to British and American foreign exchange, other foreign exchanges such as Hong Kong dollars, Philippine pesos, Vietnamese dongs, and Japanese gold can still be traded without restrictions, so British and American foreign exchange can still be arbitraged. Moreover, the United States has designated fourteen banks as markets for specially approved U.S. dollar transactions to supply U.S. dollars for legitimate commercial needs, which shows that there is no danger of interrupting the supply of U.S. dollars. From this, it can be seen that the foreign exchange market in Shanghai will never be adversely affected. Due to arbitrage, there is fear that the control of U.S. dollars cannot be as strict as expected, which is the crux of the special international market. But what can be asserted is that foreign exchange speculation will never be as reckless as in the past, and the purchase and sale of foreign exchange must also go through considerable procedures, so the wind of speculation can be slightly curbed, which is the great function of freezing funds.

Secondly, let's discuss the issues of prices in Shanghai. On the surface, because the supply of U.S. dollars is no longer free, we can no longer freely use U.S. dollars to purchase application items, so they will tend to rise. Considering the facts, the U.S. government must still supply U.S. dollars for legitimate commerce, as mentioned earlier, so this concern should be dispelled. Moreover, due to the aforementioned foreign exchange arbitrage relationship, merchants can freely use the currencies of various countries, which is not much different from the past, so prices should not rise sharply. Assuming that the worst environment occurs in Shanghai and all commercial relations with the United States are severed, prices in Shanghai should not rise either, because in addition to gasoline, kerosene, and a few industrial products, all daily necessities can be shipped from other sources to meet the market demand. Moreover, the daily necessities needed by the general public can be supplied domestically, so their living needs will not be affected by foreign exchange. Taking rice as an example, the price seems to be rising due to Japan's southward advance, but it is not known that this freezing of funds has dealt the greatest blow to Japanese gold, and its currency value will undoubtedly plummet. On the contrary, because our legal currency is subject to the control and use restrictions of U.S. dollars, it can increase in value. Therefore, there is hope for lower rice prices, and there is no reason for them to rise sharply, which is another great contribution of freezing funds.

In short, this freezing of funds has hundreds of advantages and no disadvantages for our country. The public should remain calm and wait and see what happens, while speculators should urgently change their policies and work together to transform the national economic foundation. If there are those who want to take this opportunity to manipulate prices to seek profits, they will undoubtedly receive a serious lesson.

### II. The Retaliation of Britain and the United States

Just as Japan was striding high and announcing the establishment of an agreement between France and Japan to jointly defend Vietnam, the governments of Britain and the United States simultaneously announced the freezing of Japanese funds in Britain, the United States, and all territories of the British Empire. Although Chinese funds are also included in the freezing, this is at the special request of the Chinese government, the purpose of which is only to help China stop Japan from using the foreign exchange owned by merchants and residents in the occupied areas. Therefore, in terms of the essence of this move by Britain and the United States, it is a 100% retaliation for Japan's decisive invasion of Vietnam.

According to reports from Washington, freezing funds is only one aspect of the many sanctions against Japan. Other measures, such as a complete embargo and boycotting Japanese ships, have long been under consideration by the U.S. authorities. In the future, as long as Japan takes further action, all kinds of economic weapons will inevitably be used one by one, until either an armed conflict occurs between the two sides or Japan retreats in the face of difficulties. Judging only from the current situation, this method of freezing funds, although it cannot be said to have completely controlled the economic lifeline of Japan, can at least be imagined that Japan will encounter extremely significant blows in terms of economics and even national defense. Because Japan has relied on foreign trade to maintain its domestic economy since it invaded China more than four years ago, especially trade with the United States and British territories in the Far East, the former with raw silk as the main product and the latter with cotton textiles as the main product. In the future, all financial transactions must be subject to the restriction of the permit system, and the British and American governments will naturally be able to use it to restrict the import of Japanese goods at any time, thereby trapping Japan's export industry in a difficult situation. This is the first inevitable blow. Secondly, some important resources on which Japan relies for war or survival, such as gasoline for war equipment in the United States and cotton and wool in Australia, must be paid for in U.S. dollars and British pounds. In the future, since funds have been frozen, under the manipulation of permits, they will naturally be greatly restricted, gradually trapping Japan in a situation where it cannot continue to fight or maintain its basic industries. This is the second inevitable blow.

Not only that, in addition to announcing the freezing order yesterday, the U.S. government also announced a "state of alert" by the military authorities in Hawaii. If we combine this with the words of Secretary of the Navy Knox yesterday, "The U.S. Navy is ready to be completed," it can be seen that the actions of the Washington authorities not only do not have the slightest appeasement attempt toward Japan, as has been rumored recently, but instead prove that President Roosevelt's consistent anti-aggression policy is becoming more and more resolute and clear. In addition to Britain's active strengthening of its military forces in Singapore and Malaya and Burma over the years, the Dutch East Indies authorities' unwavering rejection of Japan's harsh demands in the past, China's clear announcement that it will launch a counterattack this fall, and the common hatred of Australia, the Philippines, and New Zealand, it is not difficult to expect that if Japan does not know how to advance or retreat and continues to act rashly, then the Far East united front of China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, or even China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands and five countries, will definitely progress from the level of mutual understanding to the stage of concrete action.

Examining the significance of Japan's decisive further oppression of Vietnam is nothing more than a "reluctant second best" method of Konoe, that is, a thieving chicken policy in which the Japanese hope for "small cost and large harvest" as Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi said, but it was unexpected that this method of avoiding the important and taking the light would still incur a major retaliation from Britain and the United States. Therefore, the evolution of the Far East situation in the future will depend on Japan's movements. If Tokyo really has the determination and courage to compete with Britain and the United States, then the first step will naturally be to implement retaliation, freeze British and American funds in Japan and its sphere of influence, and at the same time brazenly occupy the entire territory of Vietnam in preparation for the next phase of military action. In this way, Britain and the United States will naturally not show weakness, and further impose a comprehensive economic blockade on Japan until both sides engage in a fire. It is reported that Japan will convene a special Privy Council meeting tomorrow to discuss urgent issues, and this meeting is of course related to Japan's future actions. It is expected that within five days, there will be a revelation of how the overall situation in the Far East will evolve. The world is facing such a major turning point in the situation and must sharpen itself in preparation to cope with all the most adverse events, without panicking and without being pessimistic, because all future changes are the most necessary in the process of clarifying the international situation, and are most conducive to the development of the democratic front. After a period of arduous struggle, we will be able to see the sun through the fog and regain the light.

### Soviet Decision: To Send a Mission to the U.S.; Perilous Situation in the Pacific; U.S. and Soviet Union Need to Strengthen Cooperation

Reuters, Washington, 26th – Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the Soviet Union is sending a special mission to the United States to negotiate the purchase of military supplies. He was unable to elaborate today. Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., Umansky, has already discussed what the Soviet Union wishes to order in the U.S., but details were not disclosed.

United Press, London, 26th – According to news here yesterday, a Soviet military delegation will soon be sent to Washington, possibly to discuss plans to deter Japanese expansion in the Far East. The delegation will be led by Lieutenant General Golikov, a senior member of the current delegation to England.

United Press, Washington, 26th – Undersecretary of State Welles told the press yesterday that he had no comment on the news from London that a Soviet military delegation would be invited to Washington to discuss plans to deter Japanese expansion in the Far East. Welles said he might have something to say later. At the same time, Mr. Welles declined to discuss the content of his lengthy conversation with Soviet Ambassador Umansky on Sunday.

International News Service, Washington, 26th – Since the meeting between Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., Umansky, and Welles, U.S.-Soviet cooperation will become closer. It is widely believed that U.S. willingness to aid the Soviet Union is closely related to the situation in the Pacific.

### Litvinov Departs for [the U.S.]

Havas, Stockholm, 26th – It has just been learned that the former Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, has already departed for the United States and is currently en route.

### Japan's Invasion of Vietnam; China Adopts Self-Defense Measures; Strengthening Defenses on the Yunnan-Burma Border; Elite Central Troops Deployed to Reinforce Yunnan-Guangxi Border; Long Yun to Establish Headquarters in Baoshan to Protect the Yunnan-Burma Road

Chongqing – Reliable sources indicate that the Chinese government is closely monitoring the situation in Vietnam, but the sources pointed out that China's policies are limited to strict self-defense, which means ensuring that the Yunnan-Guangxi border is not violated, and that the Yunnan-Burma Road remains active and unobstructed. In accordance with this principle, elite troops of the Central Army were deployed last year to take on the defense of that border. These Central Army troops have the best material equipment. The sources also said that Yunnan Chairman Long Yun is fully cooperating with the Central Government. To strengthen defenses, Chairman Long will establish headquarters in Baoshan, between the Nujiang and Mekong Rivers on the Yunnan-Burma Road. Reliable sources say that this measure is to prevent Japan from entering Yunnan via the rivers and the Mekong River basin in order to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road. Reliable sources said that Japan plans to invade Burma via Thailand in order to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road, but British defenses in eastern Burma have changed. In the past, Britain never considered the defense of the Burmese border, but now the entire eastern border is densely fortified with fortresses and airfields. (United Press, 26th)

Chongqing – At a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists on the 26th, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made serious criticisms of the Japanese military's invasion of Vietnam and the attitude taken by the Vichy government. The spokesman first stated that he had pointed out last week that Japan's repeated fabrications were a prelude to another act of aggression, which has now come to pass. Japan has indeed extended its policy of aggression to the entirety of Vietnam. Foreign Minister Guo's statement has clearly expressed the attitude and determination of the Chinese government. Since the entire territory of Vietnam has become an occupied area of the Japanese military, China, for the sake of self-defense, should take necessary measures to deal with this situation. This action by Japan is the culmination of the conquest of all of Vietnam, and at the same time, it is part of its entire plan to conquer the world. The shadow of "Eight Cords, One Universe" (Hakkō ichiu) now looms over the entire Pacific. When reporters asked for his views on the statement issued by the Vichy spokesman, the spokesman replied that he deeply regretted that the Vichy spokesman echoed the Japanese rumors, but under the current circumstances, this statement is not worth taking seriously. What we pay particular attention to is the attitude that the United States government has already stated, and the actions that the United States government is about to take. The urgency of the current situation cannot be addressed with empty words. Only action can stop action. It is heard that the U.S. President has ordered the freezing of Japanese funds, and the British government will also take the same measures. This is indeed a wise policy of the British and American governments, and can also be regarded as a concrete manifestation of the determination of Britain and America to stop Japan's expanding aggression with action. (26th)

Chongqing – The Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a reception for the press today, spoke of recent developments in Vietnam, saying that China will take self-defense plans to cope with the overall situation. This is the starting point for the end of France's sovereignty over Vietnam and the continued aggression by Japan in nearby areas. The Vichy claims of threats made by the British and Americans against Vietnam are not worth taking seriously. What is worth paying attention to are the actions that the U.S. government will announce to deal with this matter. Today, empty words are of no help; only action is effective. Therefore, all parties are now paying attention to the actions to be announced by the United States and the United Kingdom. When asked about Eden's claim of consulting with China, the spokesman replied that he was unable to comment on the issue. However, any aggression by Japan is not only related to China, but also related to friendly nations. Someone also asked what steps the United Kingdom and the United States seem to be taking. The spokesman replied that implementing a complete economic blockade against Japan would of course be the most effective step. Foreign Minister Guo also criticized the developments in Vietnam, saying that the Japanese government has now forcibly seized new land, sea, and air force bases in southern Vietnam from the French government. This move has expanded Japan's aggression in Vietnam and will make its southward advance plan one step closer. Therefore, the entire area of Vietnam can now only be regarded as being practically under Japanese military occupation. (United Press, 26th)

Chongqing – The Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today that China will take necessary steps, because Vietnam should now be regarded as an area occupied by the Japanese. The spokesman accused Japan of promoting its policies of aggression, enslavement, and plunder throughout Vietnam. The spokesman said that China does not view the statements issued by the Vichy government in the current situation as important. The spokesman said that the United States should take action to stop Japan's current strategy, and should not only rely on empty words. (United Press, 26th)

### Resident Committee of the People's Political Council Holds Tenth Meeting; Foreign Minister Guo Reports on the Diplomatic Situation

Chongqing – The tenth meeting of the Resident Committee of the National Political Council was held on the 25th. Although it was raining heavily, attendance was still very enthusiastic.

Chongqing – At yesterday morning's routine meeting of the Resident Committee of the Political Council, Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi reported. Guo did not criticize Vietnam's surrender, but said that seeing Japan's decisive action, the idea that the Konoe Cabinet was more stable could be shattered. As for whether Japan will advance south or north in the future, it will be judged by which is more advantageous. In other words, Japan will only decide its movements based on the standard of small price and large gains. (Havas, 26th)

### Details of the Detention of Two British Ships by the Japanese; British Embassy Issues Statement

Reuters, this dispatch – The Information Office of the British Embassy issued the following statement: "Various conflicting reports have been published concerning the unloading of cargo from the 'Guangdong' and 'Hydamailles,' ordered by the Japanese authorities, including statements made by a Japanese military spokesman. The facts of the case are as follows: The textile machinery purchased by the Netherlands East Indies government and unloaded from the 'Guangdong' has reportedly been admitted by the Netherlands government to be their fault, and they will bear full responsibility, because it was not inspected by the Japanese authorities before being loaded onto the British ship. This Consulate-General has no knowledge of this and doubts that the Netherlands government would make such a statement. The goods had followed all customs procedures and there was no reason for further inspection. It was not until the goods had passed through customs and were being loaded onto the 'Guangdong' that the Japanese Military Police raised objections and opposed the loading. After detailed explanations were given to the Japanese authorities that the goods were purchased by the Netherlands East Indies authorities, the 'Guangdong' was detained and the loaded goods were unloaded. As for the general cargo carried on the 'Hydamailles' destined for Hong Kong, Rangoon, and Calcutta, after all the goods were loaded onto the ship and followed all customs procedures, the Japanese Military Police opposed their export. The goods were to be transported to several Chinese merchants in the above three ports. The shipowner did not admit that the goods belonged to Chongqing or that the goods should be inspected by the Japanese authorities. Now the goods have been unloaded by the shipowner at the Gonghexiang Wharf and detained by the Japanese authorities pending a decision on whether or not to allow them to be exported."

### British Ambassador Informs Japanese Government of Abolition of Various Commercial Treaties; Imperial Departments Freeze Japanese Funds; Federated Malay States Makes Military Preparations; Dutch East Indies is Discussing Steps to Take

Reuters, London, 26th – According to responsible sources, British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has notified the Japanese government that Britain intends to abolish the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, the 1934 Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, and the 1937 Burmese-Japanese Commercial Treaty. It is heard that the British government consulted with the various Dominions on this action, and they all expressed their approval. The effective dates of abolition will be in accordance with the provisions of each treaty. For example, the notification period for the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty is twelve months, and the other two treaties are six months. As of now, Britain has not taken any steps to freeze Chinese assets in Britain. It is heard that Britain's actions will be based on the wishes of the Chinese government. The Chinese side has not yet made such a request to Britain. Reuters, Ottawa, 26th – According to Canadian Prime Minister King, Canada has responded to the United States by freezing Japanese assets in Canada and, at the request of the Chinese government, freezing Chinese assets. Canada has taken the necessary plans to prevent Japanese expatriates from withdrawing their assets in Canada. A few hours after the U.S. President announced the freezing action, the authorities here issued a statement stating that no financial transactions involving Japanese expatriates may be made without the special permission of the Foreign Exchange Control Board. Prime Minister King also said that the current methods for Chinese expatriates in Canada to remit patriotic and charitable funds will not be affected by the freezing order. A spokesman said that he knew that the assets of Japanese expatriates in Canada had been frozen for at least a week for various purposes.

Reuters, Singapore, 26th – The government of the Straits Settlements has ordered the freezing of Japanese and Chinese assets. Reuters, Singapore, 26th – Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, and the government spokesman's announcement that plans to resist the Japanese occupation of Vietnam have been agreed upon, have satisfied everyone. It is felt that a positive action will finally be realized to resist Japanese aggression. A senior official told Reuters that the era of empty words has now passed, and we have finally realized the need to order the other party to stop. As for the theoretical question of whether the defined action is purely economic in nature, or both economic and military, it has not caused much concern here. After months of continuous preparation, Malaya now believes that it can cope with any situation. This is not only true of Malaya, but of the entire ABCD line in the Far East. The troops are now eager to try. An officer told reporters, "The gloves have now been taken off, and a thumbs-up will soon be given here." This sentence can represent the spirit of anticipation for development here. It is gratifying to see that Britain is conducting consultations on the same speed with China and the Dutch East Indies and with the United States regarding the Far East issue.

All Civilized Nations in the Far East Express Excitement and Joy

Reuters, Singapore, 26th – The entire ABCD line in the Far East is excited about President Roosevelt's order to freeze Japanese assets. Not only for the special nature of this retaliatory action, but mostly for the speed with which it was taken. It was feared that although the democratic countries had clearly decided to take action against Japan's new aggression in Vietnam, it would take some time to realize it. This emotion of necessary patience has been eliminated invisibly in the joy of yesterday's action, because it is recognized that this action will certainly shock the Japanese. People here believe that the Japanese military and political authorities must now understand that the ABCD line in the Far East is not just making a show of force, and that there is a dangerous signal for continued expansion. Well-informed people here compare the current situation to Europe after Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia, meaning that if Japan continues to invade or expand, it will encounter military resistance. It is hoped that Japan can recognize this point. If the Japanese do not see this, then the responsibility for their repeated claims to want to avoid the spread of war to the Pacific will be borne by themselves.

United Press, Chongqing, 26th – The U.S. order to freeze Japanese funds was extremely welcomed by the Chinese side today, saying that this order was the beginning of President Roosevelt's actively policy of ending appeasement towards Japan that he hinted at yesterday. According to them, after the freezing of Japanese funds, Japan has no way to purchase American goods except through China and the countries of Central and South America. On the contrary, China can obtain American goods through Lend-Lease loans and barter. Apart from the highest-ranking officials, the general public was shocked by the news that Chinese funds had also been frozen at Chongqing's request, and the petty bourgeoisie who had U.S. dollars deposited in American banks in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila were also somewhat panicked. They asked whether the frozen funds were going to be transferred to the Chinese government and whether the assets of major Chinese investors who invested in the United States and were operated by American companies would also be subject to the freezing order. In the past two or three years, Chinese people have disposed of their main property in this way.

### Franco-Japanese Joint Defense Agreement Established in Vietnam; Tokyo Government Officially Announces 30,000 Japanese Troops to be Stationed in Vietnam

Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: The Japanese government announced this afternoon that Japan and France have established a joint defense agreement for Vietnam. The content of the agreement was not disclosed, only stating that Japan intends to strictly adhere to existing obligations, promising to guarantee the integrity and sovereignty of Vietnamese territory. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry also issued a statement, briefly stating that since reaching a settlement last August in which France allowed Japan to station troops in Vietnam, the historical relationship between Japan and Vietnam has grown closer. However, recent changes in Asia and Europe have greatly affected Vietnam, even threatening its security. Japan, for the sake of self-defense, cannot ignore the possibility of unrest enveloping Vietnam. Therefore, negotiations initiated by Japanese Ambassador Kato in Vichy proceeded rapidly, and the joint defense agreement for Vietnam was established on July 21st. This agreement will not only create a closer relationship between Japan and France, but also greatly contribute to the stability, co-existence, and co-prosperity of the Greater East Asia. As for the Japanese government's intention to strictly abide by all articles of the Japan-France agreement regarding Vietnam, and to respect Vietnam's territorial integrity and sovereignty, it goes without saying. Japan will further increase its efforts to promote friendly relations between Japan and France, so as to realize the co-prosperity of both countries.

Associated Press, Vichy, 26th: A French government communiqué issued this morning at 4:00 AM (11:00 AM Shanghai time) announced that the Franco-Japanese joint defense agreement for Vietnam has been established. The communiqué stated that military and technical agreements have not yet been completed and are currently under review. French authorities insist that this final defense plan respects Vietnam's territorial integrity and French sovereignty. Cabinet Coordinator Darlan convened a cabinet meeting at 5:00 PM today to review the situation in the Far East and the Franco-Japanese negotiations regarding Japan's acquisition of bases in Vietnam. Marshal Pétain will end his vacation and return here today. Reuters, Hanoi, 26th: Representative Sumita of the Japanese military mission and his staff left here this morning for Saigon.

Reuters, Singapore, 26th: According to the most reliable sources, the terms of the Franco-Japanese agreement regarding Vietnam are as follows: (1) Japan occupies Cam Ranh Bay; (2) Japan occupies the Saigon air force base; (3) 4,000 Japanese troops are stationed in Vietnam.

International News Service, New York, 26th: According to a report from Chongqing to here by the National Broadcasting Company, French Indochina has allowed Japan to occupy Cam Ranh Bay and station 12,000 troops at Saigon, Cape St. Jacques, and various airfields in southern Vietnam.

Kunming, 26th: According to well-informed sources here, more than 30,000 Japanese army troops will land in Vietnam.

Associated Press, Saigon, 26th: It was learned today that although the Franco-Japanese agreement permitting Japan to establish bases in southern Vietnam will take effect here next Tuesday, it is believed that Japanese troops will not land here before the end of this month. It is reported that in addition to establishing bases and stationing troops in important areas of southern Vietnam, Japanese warships will also be stationed in Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay. A representative of the Japanese military delegation stated that it will take considerable time for Japanese military aircraft to arrive in southern Vietnam because factories, ground personnel, and gasoline pumps must first be deployed to support the aircraft. An authoritative official stated that only a small number of Japanese warships will be stationed here, declaring that approximately four destroyers will be stationed in and around Saigon, and one cruiser and three destroyers will be stationed in Cam Ranh Bay.

Japanese Invasion of Vietnam Supported by Germany and Italy

International News Service, Berlin, 26th: A government spokesman announced yesterday that the German government had informed the Japanese government that the Germans would adopt cooperative measures in Vichy and Vietnam to resist British aggression in the Far East. The spokesman criticized the United States for interfering in the Eastern Hemisphere, saying that President Roosevelt and Undersecretary of State Welles "are pursuing war throughout the world." The spokesman continued, saying that he believed the Japanese would give a proper response to the German assurance at the appropriate time.

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 26th: Gaeda commented that the Japanese military occupation of bases in Vietnam is the first stage of its southward advance, and Berlin and Rome were notified in advance on July 15th. The German and Italian governments have fully agreed to this matter. The conditions Japan presented to Vietnam were: (1) Japanese troops will be stationed in Vietnamese territory; (2) Japanese troops will be allowed to establish naval and air force bases; (3) The integrity of Vietnamese territory and sovereignty will be recognized. Japan has now stepped into the gateways of Singapore and the Philippines and is increasingly close to the Dutch East Indies. In addition to the two military ports already occupied by Japan in Vietnam, Cam Ranh Bay and Beta Long have now been added, allowing Japan to completely control all of Vietnam and the waters where British and American bases are concentrated, thereby negating the effectiveness of the chain of encirclement of Japan by Britain and the United States. This simple fact is sufficient to demonstrate the significance of Japan's southward advance. From this, Britain and the United States can no longer gain a military advantage.

### Japanese Cabinet Meeting Discusses Economic and International Situation; National Mobilization Committee to Control Metals

Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: The cabinet held a regular meeting yesterday to discuss the Treasury Minister's report on the economic situation, and Foreign Minister Toyoda also explained recent international developments. It is widely believed that Treasury Minister Ogura will discuss all the possibilities for Japan in the event that Britain and the United States freeze Japanese assets. The National General Mobilization Committee is now preparing four measures for immediate implementation, submitting them to the 16th meeting next Wednesday for approval. These four measures are: (1) Control of metals; (2) Organization of large industries; (3) Management of seaports and transportation; (4) Management of power distribution. Tokyo newspapers continue to say that China, Britain, and the United States are threatening Vietnam, and that the security of Vietnam is necessary for the fulfillment of the Japan-Vietnam treaty, so the Japanese army cannot tolerate foreign interference. At the same time, the official document sent by the United States to Japanese Ambassador Nomura has only been published here in outline, and official circles are currently studying this document. Well-informed sources predict that Japan will issue a stern rebuttal.

Associated Press, Tokyo, 26th: The Japanese government did not comment yesterday on Undersecretary of State Welles' criticism of its occupation of Vietnam. It is reported that Japanese officials will not issue any document in response to Welles' criticism. Newspapers have also not published the full text of Welles' remarks. Unofficial Japanese figures believe that Welles' remarks will make Japan feel unpleasant and predict that the government will issue a reply to explain Japan's position in East Asia after discussing the issues raised by Welles. Observers believe that Welles' remarks will cause Japan-US relations to become increasingly tense, as Japanese newspapers have implemented anti-American propaganda after hearing that the United States is encircling Japan and interfering in Japan's "new order."

Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that maintaining peace in the Pacific is currently most beneficial to the United States. The failure of the Axis powers hinges on peace in the Pacific, so the United States must avoid a direct conflict with Japan. The United States cannot lightly challenge the Japanese navy at this time. It is expected that the United States will now strive to maintain peace in the Pacific, warning that Japan should maintain its highest level of spiritual and material efficiency to cope with any contingency.

### Thai Troops Ordered to Prepare for Any Eventuality; British Ambassador Visits Thai Prime Minister

Reuters, Bangkok, 26th: Japanese sources say that the Thai cabinet convened a special meeting to consider the new situation in the Far East. Troops have been ordered to prepare for any eventuality, and large anti-aircraft teams will soon be organized.

Reuters, Bangkok, 26th: British Ambassador Sir Josiah Crosby visited the Thai Prime Minister yesterday afternoon for an hour and a half. The Thai Prime Minister also holds the post of Foreign Minister.

Reuters, Bangkok, 26th: Today's Thai Siri newspaper said that the statements made by the Japanese are often contradictory. The Japanese once said that Britain boasted that its troops stationed in the East were only one-fifth of their claimed strength, and not even enough to defend Malaya. Now they say that Britain plans to invade Vietnam. Isn't this self-contradictory?

Associated Press, Bangkok, 26th: The King of Thailand yesterday awarded the Grand Cordon of the Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand to the Japanese Minister and Colonel Tamura, and five other members of the Japanese Embassy were also awarded other types of medals.

### Most American Residents Preparing to Leave Japan

Associated Press, Tokyo, 26th: Most American residents in Japan are preparing to leave Japan today due to the freezing of assets by the United States. The total number of American residents currently in Japan is 621. It is reported that most Americans will leave Japan immediately because the American freezing order has made them unemployed.

### US-British Shipping Cooperation; US Sends Experts to the Far East; Headquarters in Singapore

Associated Press, Washington, 26th: A spokesman for the Maritime Commission said yesterday that the commission had dispatched experts to various ports in the Far East and Africa to coordinate the shipping of vessels in times of emergency. Those stationed in Honolulu are Colonel Froude, Manila is Johnson, and Singapore is Gedjil. Their important tasks are to transport aid to Britain and load military raw materials for return to the country. The Commission also believes that they will use all Pacific vessels for shipping with significant strength, as the Pacific coast is the main source of military raw materials. The experts will also cooperate with Britain and other allied countries. At the same time, Philippine Resident Commissioner Elizalde yesterday discussed the matter with President Gray of the American President Lines for about an hour, possibly as Gray plans to go to Africa as a special representative of Commerce Secretary Jones, and the trip is related to the loan to the Philippines.

Associated Press, Washington, 26th: The Maritime Commission is sending seven shipping experts to the Far East and Africa. The commission said that the experts are stationed in Durban, Calcutta, Singapore, and Honolulu, but two are stationed in the Red Sea area and added that the headquarters are in Singapore.

### Soviet Union Uncovers Nazi Conspiracy to Invade Turkey; Obtains Secret Maps and Documents; Half of the Content Has Been Notified to the Turkish Government

Tass, Moscow, 26th: The Red Army, which defeated the German 52nd Chemical Division on July 15th, obtained secret maps and plans regarding Turkey and the European part of the Straits west of Sytschewo. The documents include:

(1) A booklet entitled "Military Geographical Statistics of the European Part of Turkey (including the Straits)," with charts and plans concerning Turkish airfields, military locations, and transportation; (2) A map of the European part of Turkey, scale 1:500,000, indicating the main roads of Turkey; (3) A military geographical plan of Istanbul, scale 1:15,000; (4) A map of the Bosphorus, scale 1:100,000, indicating Turkish military targets; (5) A map of the Gulf of Izmit, scale 1:100,000, indicating military targets.

All of these documents are marked "For Official Use Only." Turkish military targets are indicated by symbols, such as airfields, arsenals, ports, hardware factories, bridges, and even the condition of each object, as well as building materials, are explained. The number of Turkish troops, their locations, vehicle numbers, landing sites, the area of ​​the Klais harbor, and the depth of seawater at various locations are all included in the booklet. The advance routes of motorized units are also indicated. For example, the original text on page 9 reads: "The most difficult task for any army attempting to occupy or cross Turkey is to cross the Straits. The possibility of such crossing of the Straits will be stated in the section describing the Bosphorus, Istanbul, the Sea of ​​Marmara, and the Dardanelles."

Page 26 concerns the issue of stationing troops in Istanbul. The original text reads, "The most suitable location for European troops and headquarters is the Pera district. There are seven large hotels in this area, the best of which are the Pera Palace, the Tokatlian Hotel, and several smaller hotels. In addition, the French school and the German school can be used as administrative agencies. Taxim has wide avenues, most suitable for building barracks and parking lots."

On page 15, the fascist aggressors discuss the possibility of landing in the northern Black Sea, stating that landing is very difficult due to the large waves and rugged coastline, and can only be carried out using small fishing boats. South of this, landing is slightly easier, but will encounter fierce fire from the "Chatalja" line of defense.

These documents prove the goals of the Hitler government. These documents have been distributed by the German High Command to the various corps that will implement the plan. In the past, German fascists have repeatedly spread rumors of a Soviet "conspiracy to invade Turkey." Now they have revealed their ferocious face. On the one hand, German aggressors sign agreements with Turkey to divert its attention, and on the other hand, they secretly prepare to invade Turkey. The Soviet Union and Turkey have extremely friendly relations, so it is deemed necessary to notify the Turkish side. The Soviet authorities have notified the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union of Hitler's conspiracy to invade Turkey and the evidence.

### Japanese Zoo Saves Money by Feeding Dog Meat to Tigers

Havas, Tokyo, 25th: A certain Japanese zoo keeps five tigers, feeding them about 42 pounds of rabbit meat every day. The zoo authorities recently decided to switch to dog meat because the cost was too high, saving 500 yen in expenses per month. When the tigers first saw the dog meat, they sniffed it briefly and turned away, going on strike from eating. After a few days, they were forced to eat it reluctantly due to hunger.

### Latin American Countries Suppress Nazi Activities; US Says No Intention of Occupying Liberia

Reuters, London, 26th: Several Latin American republics have recently taken self-defense actions to prevent the sabotage activities of private and public Nazi groups that have long enjoyed preferential treatment. News from Latin America received in London in recent days confirms that the long-suspected Nazi plan to first weaken South America and then invade the South American continent via the so-called Dakar Strait is true. It is expected that the investigation by South and Central American authorities into German espionage and conspiracy work will have surprising developments. The Bolivian government's pre-emptive move to curb the Nazi riot and expel the German Minister Winterle shows that the danger is imminent. London's criticism compares the failed rebellion of Rashid Ali in Iraq with the recent events in Bolivia, and calls it another failed German conspiracy. Chile's request that the former German Minister to Bolivia, Winterle, leave the country immediately and not stay is very satisfying here, and it can also prove that what the committee investigating Nazi activities in Chile recently discovered must be very serious. Argentine political police recently searched several offices of Nazi organizations (located in the same building as the German Embassy and Consulate) and seized several documents. What they have discovered will be announced one after another. General comments in London say that no country, no matter how far away from Berlin, can escape the Nazi threat unless it takes strong preventive action.

Reuters, Washington, 26th: Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the United States has absolutely no intention of occupying the Republic of Liberia in Africa. It is reported that Parisian newspapers recently spread the rumor that the US government is preparing to occupy Liberia and suggested that a certain European power should occupy Dakar for protection.

Reuters, London, 26th: The Air Ministry Information Office stated that American-made Flying Fortresses and other British bombers heavily bombed the German battleships "Gneisenau" on Thursday. The Flying Fortress crews had received special training. They were ordered to depart after breakfast, carrying oxygen, and flew to over 36,000 feet to aim and drop bombs. Other British bombers also flew in to bomb. German aircraft took off to intercept fiercely. At night, British aircraft bombed the German naval bases of Kiel and Emden, both of which caught fire.

Reuters, London, 26th: German radio acknowledged that British aircraft attacked Berlin, saying that British aircraft flew to Germany last night, and after fierce resistance by German fighters, only a few were able to reach the city of Berlin, dropping several bombs in residential areas, causing no military or economic damage, and causing several deaths and injuries. Five aircraft were shot down.

Reuters, Lisbon, 26th: Well-informed sources who recently arrived here from Berlin told a Reuters reporter that the people of Berlin are now making major preparations because they expect to be subjected to more intense attacks by the British Air Force due to the short nights and long days. When he left Berlin, a German friend said goodbye, saying, "Please pray for us this winter." The Germans are all concerned about the British Air Force and the food shortage next year, and fear that the Americans will go further in this war and repeat the history of the last great war. Throughout Germany, there is deep disappointment and anxiety about the progress of the war in the Soviet Union.

### American-Made Flying Fortresses Heavily Attack German Naval Ports; British Aircraft also Fly to Berlin to Bomb

Reuters, London, 26th: An Air Ministry communiqué stated that according to assessments, British aircraft attacked the German battleships "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" yesterday, shooting down a total of 21 German fighters, including the 12 already announced.

### Central Front Red Army Launches Large-Scale Counteroffensive, German Left and Right Wing Offensives Halted

Reuters, London, 26th - British military circles have learned that on the Smolensk line, the Soviet army has launched a very large-scale counteroffensive.

Reuters, Moscow, 26th - An official communique stated that the Red Army, resisting the German forces in Smolensk, has defeated the Fifth Nazi Infantry Division in a counteroffensive. Neutral observers here seem to believe that the Soviet army is firmly defending the central front and its left and right flanks (namely, the Proskurov-Novgorod area in the north and the Bobruisk area in the south). The German offensives in the Polkov area and Zhitomir southwest of Kiev have also been apparently hindered. Fierce battles are ongoing on all fronts. As for the situation on the Finnish front, there is still no clear information. The German news there is attempting to break into Petrozavodsk. The communique also stated that the Soviet fleet is still cooperating with the army to attack German motorized units and German airfields.

TASS, Moscow, 26th - Last night and this morning, our army continued its heroic resistance in Polotsk, Nevel, Smolensk, and Zhitomir. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses, which has been confirmed by enemy command reports (the reports were intercepted by our side). Yesterday, our air force shot down 47 enemy planes and assisted the army in fighting enemy mechanized units.

Reuters, London, 6th - A Reuters dispatch from Moscow stated that the German attacks on Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev are still being blocked. Currently, the German army is probing the Soviet army's lines for possible weaknesses along a 2,000-mile front in an attempt to succeed. The German army in the center has been deadlocked in front of Smolensk for a long time. In this area, the German army has penetrated the Soviet lines, forming a wedge shape, with its head and tail far apart, and there is a danger of being attacked from the side by the Soviet army. According to the latest Soviet communiques, fierce battles are still ongoing in five front-line areas. The German side has not claimed a major victory, only stating that "the war is proceeding according to plan." On the central front, in the Smolensk area and Polotsk and Nevel northwest of the city, there were continuous major battles last night. Because the Soviet army is resisting strongly, the German side cannot gain a military advantage and is now using propaganda methods to try to persuade the Soviet army to abandon its arms. The official Italian news agency in Berlin reported that the German army is now using powerful loudspeakers to urge the surrounded Soviet army to abandon its arms. Some German soldiers in the propaganda team have been awarded the Iron Cross for successfully installing these loudspeakers near enemy positions.

Soviet Capital Air Defense Strong, German Night Raid Foiled

Reuters, Moscow, 26th - The previous night, Moscow enjoyed a relatively quiet night because the Soviet air force had defeated the German aircraft group that was attempting to attack the Soviet capital for the fourth time. Night fighters and anti-aircraft guns drove away all German planes. Only a few German planes broke through into the skies over Moscow to carry out indiscriminate bombing. At that time, two were shot down. According to official reports, in four air raids, the Soviet Union's defense measures shot down a total of 44 German planes. 10% of German planes that attacked the Soviet Union in the previous three raids have been shot down. On Thursday night, Moscow had two consecutive air raid alerts, one lasting 90 minutes and the other lasting nearly two hours. Thousands of men and women, expecting an air raid, took their food and bedding into the tunnels and stations at night, believing that the tunnels and stations were safe havens.

German-Soviet Five-Week War Casualties Reach Three Million

International News Service, Berlin, 26th - It was announced here yesterday that after the Soviet troops in the Nevel and Mogilev areas collapsed in the German encirclement, 20,000 Soviet troops in the Nevel area and 10,000 Soviet troops in the Mogilev area were captured by the German army.

German Side Frankly Admits Preparing for Poison Gas Warfare

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 26th - According to German officials, the Geneva Convention does not prohibit the preparation for poison gas warfare. All units are studying poison gas warfare and preparing to conduct poison gas warfare. No military authority can risk not preparing to deal with the enemy's use of poison gas. If the Soviet Union uses the discovery of German instructions for preparing for poison gas warfare as an excuse to launch poison gas warfare, the German army will respond appropriately.

Reuters, London, 26th - Moscow Radio stated that the Soviet side has seized German instructions to its troops on the use of poison gas and showed them to foreign reporters in Moscow. The instructions pay close attention to artillery units equipped with poison gas bombs and poison gas mines. Several sections of the instructions are as follows: Artillery units equipped with chemical bombs are designed to prevent the enemy from fighting, hinder their actions, reduce their combat effectiveness, and prevent them from breaking through the lines. Enemy troops can be affected by gas far from the gas explosion point, much farther than the range of shrapnel. The enemy cannot estimate the extent of the gas danger, so they are also psychologically affected. The effectiveness of artillery units equipped with poison gas depends on the weather and terrain. Calm weather or a slight breeze, cloudy skies, and weak sunlight are most suitable for gas. The use of certain gases is suitable for dark weather and drizzle. This climate is mostly available in the early morning or evening and at night, which is the most suitable time for artillery units equipped with chemical bombs to operate. Today, the Berlin official news agency published an article acknowledging that the methods of gas warfare have been distributed to the German army commanders on the Eastern Front, but said that the German military leaders' research of these rules is only a common occurrence. If the Soviet side wants to use the acquisition of these rules as an excuse to start gas warfare, Germany will respond appropriately.

Military observers believe that this plan will be implemented before September 15, as the arrival of the Caucasus cases is quite early.

### The Policy of Appeasement of Foreign Exchange Is Unreliable: The US Finally Freezes Japanese Funds; The Chinese Government Is Willing to Be Included in the Freeze Even at the Cost of Sacrifice; Only Hoping for Concrete Measures Soon to Comfort the Hopes of the People

Our newspaper has often stated that the Shanghai foreign exchange market involves too much, with countless problems that are difficult to remedy. Such a complex issue, tied to national policy, must consider both national economy and people's livelihood, weigh both domestic and foreign concerns, compare the pros and cons, and then strictly ban speculative trading and conspiracy arbitrage. It must also adopt effective methods to prevent it, while making every effort to maintain legitimate commercial needs. At that time, we hoped that Fox would return to Hong Kong after his visit to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, two weeks later, the signs of an impending issue have already begun to appear. During these two weeks, we have only seen Japanese merchants selling US dollars and receiving legal tender, in large quantities. As the proverb goes, a halo around the moon indicates wind, and dampness on the plinth foretells rain. From this, we know that the prospect of freezing funds is not far off. Yesterday, our newspaper's foreign exchange report was still headlined "Only Someone Inside Is Selling US Dollars," the implication of which is evident. Unexpectedly, the US took action to freeze Japanese funds yesterday morning. The Chinese government, willing to sacrifice, is also included in the freeze. Such a spirit of a brave man cutting off his hand when bitten by a venomous snake is admirable, and should have been done long ago. The reason why it has been delayed until today is that British and American merchants are still engaged in compromise, unwilling to push their financial and commercial power to create a buffer in conflict and appeasement in politics. This has made it impossible to control the Shanghai black market, all because of selfish desires, which lead to blindness and inaccurate perceptions. For example, those who have foreign exchange, those who engage in arbitrage, and those who engage in speculative trading, naturally do not support foreign exchange controls. The more chaotic the market, the better, so they can fish in troubled waters. This bad mentality is no different from rice merchants advancing to the south.

Now that the freeze has been implemented, the prices of all kinds of commodities soared yesterday. This mentality assumes that once foreign exchange is frozen, it will be difficult to obtain, and the legal tender will lose its support. The price of Japanese fresh banknotes has risen every day, reflecting the mentality of Shanghai merchants, which is completely unnecessary. It should be understood that freezing Chinese foreign exchange, in reality, only freezes the foreign exchange within the occupied areas. The foreign exchange of free China is originally under control. Those who need foreign exchange for legitimate business needs are supplied as usual, without any inconvenience. Only Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places have always been laissez-faire, allowing people to take whatever they want without restriction. If this loophole is not plugged, the effect of the freeze will be equal to zero. Therefore, it must be linked to achieve complete success. But it is believed that the Chinese government will not ignore the welfare of the people in the occupied areas and the legitimate commercial activities that should exist. It is expected that there will be appropriate solutions to help them operate. This is one aspect. There are still many British and American businesses in Shanghai that trade with British and American businesses. If it can be guaranteed that they will not be used as cover or leak information, and since they are all on the same side, obtaining foreign exchange will naturally be easier. This is another aspect. For the foreign exchange needed for the necessities of people's lives, the Chinese government will still maintain it under a reliable audit system. However, the supply of foreign exchange for luxury goods and non-essential items will definitely be restricted. This is another aspect. As for those who have foreign exchange, there is no need to panic. The Chinese government will never allow the legitimate property of Chinese and foreign merchants to suffer losses. This is another aspect. However, those who have sold short may be in trouble, and there is nowhere to cover. Therefore, the exchange rate rebounded yesterday, which is a deserved consequence. It is hoped that the government will unify the supply and demand of foreign exchange, so as to adjust its trend and maintain the appropriate level of both national economy and people's livelihood, increase the value of legal tender, and alleviate the suffering of the people. This is not only true for the livelihood of the people in the occupied areas, but also has interconnected effects on the livelihood of the people in the free areas. Therefore, we hope for further indication soon to comfort the hopes of the people.

Shorts Forced to Cover Heavily

The foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC listed exchange rates did not change. In the grey market for British and American exchange rates, it first loosened and then suddenly tightened sharply. In the morning, Japanese banks peddled US dollars without any takers. Even the HSBC bank sold some. The US dollar was sold at 5.40625 yuan, and the British exchange at 3 shillings and 25 pence. Unexpectedly, at 9:30, the British government announced the freezing of Japanese funds and funds in the Chinese occupied areas. Speculators in the city, who were currently in a short position, rushed to cover their positions, in a very large amount amidst the chaos. During the process, British and American commercial banks successively sold off, but the gold price soared, and speculative buying increased unabated. At noon, the US dollar tightened to 5.125 yuan, and the British exchange tightened to 3 shillings and 14.0625 pence. Later, the US dollar alone rebounded slightly, but the tightening of the British exchange was still substantial. Half-day trading was very active. Chinese merchants bought about 1.5 million US dollars. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday.

US Dollar Tightens to 5.125 Yuan

Since the morning's foreign telegraphic dispatches, the silver markets in the UK and India have fallen, while the US silver market has not changed. The exchange rates of various countries against the British and American currencies have been flat. The central government's listed exchange rates have not changed. The opening price of the domestic interbank market for spot British exchange was 3 shillings and 2.34375 pence, and the US dollar was 5.34375 yuan. After the opening, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yokohama Specie Bank came to offer August US dollars at 5.40625 yuan, but there were no takers. It was heard that HSBC sold this month at 5.375 yuan, and foreign banks traded among themselves at 5.40625 yuan. The market situation loosened. The British exchange also hardened to 3 shillings and 25 pence. The HSBC listed exchange rates were all flat. The silver balancing tax was reduced by 25 points, calculated at 24.25%. Later, foreign dispatches came, and speculators rushed to cover their short positions and went long, vying to buy July and August at 5.375 yuan without success. They then pushed it up to 5.3125 yuan and 5.28125 yuan. At that time, the US bank slightly showed willingness to supply, and it rebounded to 5.3125 yuan at around 10 o'clock, which could be closed. However, people's minds were already going up. After 10:30, the foreign bank's willingness to supply faded again, and speculative buying rose again, vying to close July and August at 5.25 yuan and 5.1875 yuan. Near noon, it tightened further to 5.125 yuan, and the British exchange also tightened to 3 shillings and 14.0625 pence. They had all tightened below the HSBC listed exchange rates. The small counter of that bank also softened the US dollar from 5.3125 yuan to 5.125 yuan. Before the noon closing, foreign commercial banks saw the price and slightly supplied, and the US dollar rebounded to 5.21875 yuan. At the noon closing, both spot and August term were 3 shillings and 14.0625 pence for the British exchange, and 5.1875 yuan for the US dollar, a tightening of 0.09375 and 0.15625 yuan respectively compared to the previous day's evening closing of spot and futures.

### Gold Market: Sudden Huge Changes; Spot Trading at 7,400 Yuan

Yesterday, the gold market's black market suddenly underwent shocking and huge changes. It first fell, once breaking through the 6,500 yuan mark, then suddenly surged wildly, soaring beyond 6,600 yuan. Everyone's mood suddenly turned from fatigue to firm. Initially, it was because Japanese banks were peddling foreign exchange without anyone paying attention, so under the selling pressure of securities brokers and bill brokers, it retreated to 6,482 yuan. At 9:28, Reuters telegraphed that the US government announced the simultaneous freezing of funds of both China and Japan. The US dollar and British exchange both rose sharply amidst the 1.5 million yuan covering spree by speculators. A fierce buying frenzy also rose in the market. The Shanghai West Side gangs, such as Yi Yuan, De Fu, Yi Da (buying eight or nine thousand taels), Xin Feng, Yong, etc., turned long and bought heavily. Although Heng Ji (selling 15,000 taels), Da Feng (selling 10,000 taels), Tian Yuan, etc., repeatedly tried to sell, the supply and demand were still disparate, and retail investors had also turned long. With buying pressure and no selling pressure, the price rose higher and higher, soaring to a high price of 6,670 yuan. It then retreated slightly, and continued to rise by 94 yuan. The upward trend reignited after the closing. More than 100,000 taels were traded in the first half of the day. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. The off-market price rose again to 6,660 yuan, with demand and no supply. The swap (July to August) seller offered 50 yuan to the buyer but did not trade. The cash price soared even more sharply, breaking the historical record of 7,250 yuan on May 6 last year, and creating an unprecedented high price of 7,400 yuan. In the morning, Zhongxing sold 20 taels to Chengji and 40 taels to Decheng, at a price of 7,300 yuan. By noon, it had risen to 7,350 yuan. In the afternoon, it was 7,400 yuan. A certain gold shop had sold it, a rise of 230 yuan. Jewelry gold rose by 20 yuan, also creating a high price of 760 yuan.

Futures Market Expands

Since the morning, because the foreign exchange reported loosening, and the Japanese bank offered US dollars at 5.40625 without takers, people's minds were very fatigued. Therefore, the market opened at 9:15 amidst selling pressure, and it had already fallen to 6,500 yuan, a low opening of 16 yuan. Yi Da, Xin Feng Yong, and Chi Da came to sell, and retail investors squeezed. The price continued to fall to 6,482 yuan. Suddenly, Yi Da and Xin Feng Yong came to recover and bought fiercely. Retail investors were in surprise, and favorable news came. The foreign exchange was difficult to sell even at 5.3125 yuan amidst the speculative buying spree. The buying wind expanded. Li Tai, Yi Yuan, Ding Sheng, Ren Cheng Yong, De Fu, and Tong Kang Yong all rose and bought heavily. Retail investors also turned long and advanced fiercely. The price suddenly soared by 100 yuan, reaching 6,580 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, the US dollar at 5.3125 yuan could be closed again. Moreover, Xin Yuan, Tian Yuan, Tong Kang Yong, Heng Ji, and Da Feng all tried to sell hard, and a small pullback to 6,530 yuan was seen. At 10:20, the foreign exchange tightened and sharpened again amidst the speculative buying spree. Favorable rumors became even more prevalent. Yi Yuan, Yi Da, Xin Feng Yong, De Fu, and Li Tai reignited and bought heavily. Tong Kang Yong was particularly keen to buy. The price rose again by 140 yuan, reaching 6,670 yuan. At noon, the US dollar slightly recovered to 5.21875 yuan, which could be closed. Da Feng, Tian Yuan, and Heng Ji were still selling, and De Fu came out again. A decline of 60 yuan was initially seen. The noon closing was 6,610 yuan, a continued rise of 94 yuan compared to the previous day's evening closing price. Based on the closing price of August US dollars at 5.1875 yuan, it was 6,713 yuan, a squeeze of 103 yuan. After the closing, there was another buying spree, rising to 6,645 yuan. There was a high-low fluctuation of 188 yuan in the first half of the day. In the afternoon, the off-market price rose to 6,660 yuan with buyers. The cash gold price of the local brand gold shop was 7,500 yuan, and the closing price was within 7,400 yuan. There was no price or market for the current standard gold.

Jewelry Gold Also Sets Unprecedented High Price

The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael, Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang initially listed 740 yuan. At 10:45, it rose by 5 yuan. At 11 o'clock, it rose another 5 yuan. At 12 o'clock, it was 5 yuan higher. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, it rose another 5 yuan, reaching 760 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 40 yuan, it was said.

The trend of Hong Kong notes was also firm. In addition, notes such as Singapore, Annam, Robi, Canada, and Philippines all trended upward. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes uniformly rose sharply. The former rose to 2 yuan and 10 cents, and the latter rose to 1 yuan and 74 cents.

### Securities: No One Knows What to Do in the Bond Market Amidst Freezing Announcements

Yesterday's grey market for public bonds was due to the complexity of the rumors. Foreign news was very complicated. There were rumors that the United States had frozen Chinese and Japanese funds, and that the Shanghai US garrison troops were ordered to prepare to withdraw at any time. Most public bond practitioners did not know what to do. It should be expected to go down, but the market opened low. In half a day, the multiple parties were afraid of it falling, and they lifted it up to confuse people's eyes. Most of them, while at a loss, saw this and followed blindly to buy in. Type C opened at 69 yuan and 30 cents. After a brief period of hovering, it gradually rose, reaching a high price of 71 yuan. Hong Da, Lian Yi, Xie Xing Yuan, Tong Kang, and Heng Kang bought in, and Lian He, Yi Chang, Da Feng, and Run De sold out. However, the advance was sharp and the retreat was rapid, breaking through 71 yuan again. There are many changes in the future, and it is still difficult to be optimistic. As a result, it rose by another 55 to 95 cents, with a transaction volume of about 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

For stock trading, 50 shares of Wuzhou Pharmacy stock were traded at a price of 170 yuan and 50 cents.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Is Greatly Shaken: New Price of Double Horse at 1,649 Yuan

The yarn market, which had been hovering for many days, underwent a major change yesterday. This was because the United States froze funds to Japan, and China was also included in the freeze. As a result, the market was shaken, and speculative buying suddenly became rampant. Under this environment, general floating households had to rush to cover their positions, and the situation of course rose. However, actual transactions remained as quiet as ever, so the rise was roundabout. Today's peak price has broken through 1,642 yuan on July 3. Midway, it fell back to 1,522 yuan. Now, the high price has reached 1,649 yuan. Yesterday morning, the high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,649 yuan, and the low price was 1,605 yuan. In the afternoon, there were no transactions as usual at the end of the week, but encountering a large wave, it also moved yesterday, initially making 1,638 yuan, rising to 1,646 yuan, then returning to 1,639 yuan, and the final price was 1,646 yuan, it was said that someone wanted to buy.

Double Horse opened in the morning, because American cotton continued to rise, and people's spirits were outstanding. The first lot price was 1,610 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,613 yuan. Then it was heard that after the standard gold market opened, it suddenly jumped to 787 yuan. The foreign exchange was reorganized, and the market buying spree rose sharply, rising to 1,618 and 1,619 yuan. There was a period of ups and downs here. Unexpectedly, around 11 o'clock, it was heard that foreign telegrams had arrived, and Chinese and Japanese funds had all been frozen. As a result, speculative buyers were active, and the buying sound in the market shook the sky. The market released 1,640 yuan, directly seeing it rise to 1,649 yuan. Subsequently, the current sales were not strong, and profit-takers released their holdings. The standard gold also went down, falling to 1,630 yuan. The price returned to 1,637 yuan after the closing. The amount of purchases by each gang in the first half of the day is listed below.

Morning market conditions of the gold Double Horse futures yarn, the trend was still uneven, and the market price was near weak and far firm. Because the floating longs were reselling in the near term, it was still weak by 1.5 yuan. However, when shooting to the far month, because the number of buyers increased, September suddenly rose by 5 yuan, and October rose by 7 yuan. Until after 10 o'clock, it was suddenly heard that the United States had frozen Japanese funds, and American cotton had also risen sharply. The gold price also rose sharply. At this time, buyers were excited, and the shorts were unfavorable and rushed to cover their positions. The price once rose sharply, with the August term soaring to 1,506 yuan, the September term to 1,566 yuan, and the October term to 1,583 yuan. Afterwards, because the rise was too fierce, it caused a part of the longs to take the opportunity to exit the market, and each month fell back by 17 to 23 yuan. The August term at noon closing still rose sharply by 33.5 yuan compared to the previous day, the September term rose by 31 yuan, and the October term rose by 20 yuan. The transaction volume increased sharply. A total of 22,000 bales were traded in half a day, a large increase of 15,100 bales compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, because the market was closed on Saturday, the opening, closing, high, and low prices in the first half of the day are recorded on the left (net market price).

### Cotton Market also Advances Quickly

The spot cotton situation is very firm. One reason is that American cotton has been soaring. The second reason is that the foreign exchange has been frozen. The yarn market has jumped greatly, and the cotton market has followed suit. However, the factory's thinking is more flat, but speculative trading has greatly increased, and the market price is rising step by step.

Another dispatch states that the trading of foreign cotton orders in Shanghai port is firm and expensive, but due to the very chaotic international situation and the gradually deteriorating Shanghai situation, the intention to purchase has subsided. Yesterday, except for the flower number houses that slightly had the intention to purchase spot goods, the cotton trading was not concerned at all.

The New York cotton market is active, concentrated and firm due to the enthusiastic buying intentions of the public. At the same time, it has risen sharply because of the deteriorating cotton production and harvest situation, and the Washington political report that the agricultural loan department firmly opposes the release of loan cotton. As a result, the closing price yesterday rose by 42 to 48 pounds for each grade compared to the previous day.

Another dispatch states that the statistics of American cotton from August 1 last year to July 25 this year are recorded on the left (each bale is 500 pounds).

The Indian cotton market first fell due to speculators selling, but then rebounded due to the firm rise in the stock market and other market conditions. As a result, the closing price rose and fell by 12 Robi. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be viewed as high by 4.45 Robi due to the high rise in American cotton.

### Medicinal Materials: Medicine Galangal Slightly Loosened

Recently, medicine galangal has seen a slight weakening trend, because the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs have gone to the stomach and turned quiet, and the market price has reached its peak. However, the bottom remains small, and it has not been seen to be too small for a while. It is about 10 yuan lower than before. White-skinned medicine galangal is called at 215 yuan, and then it will be lowered.

### Grain: Rice Merchants Use Every Possible Means to Raise the Future Price Again on the Pretext that the Actual Rice Reserves Are Sufficient and Foreign Rice Flows Are Still the Same

Foreign rice was still weak in the market yesterday morning because there were many stocks. The published survey of rice stocks in the city was 1,274,852 bags, and adding those that had not been surveyed, the total was 200 to 300,000 stone. There is Hong Kong rice supply in this street, and the supply from other ports is still lacking. Such a quantity is enough to resist the rise in market prices. Therefore, the market saw a decline of about 1 yuan in the morning. Unexpectedly, as soon as the saying that funds were frozen was spread, it immediately triggered the activities of speculative gangs, and the sound of buying rose, which was unusually exciting. The market price was shouted higher and higher. The fatigue that had been in the morning was broken, and the people's minds were passionate. The ball-kicking flow was even more active, and the small jiao rice in the morning market was 116 yuan, down to 114.5 yuan, and then from 116 yuan to 118 yuan. Yinghua Si spot was from 144 yuan to 146 yuan, and the period was from 144.5 yuan to 146.5 yuan. No. 2 Siam was 141 yuan. Other common goods from Min Dang opened to 123.5 yuan, the next was 118 yuan, and the special was 130 yuan. The Da Shi rice from Jiafo was 122.3 yuan, the central control was 117 yuan, the next was 115.8 yuan, and the special was from 127 yuan to 129 yuan. Only Dongjing tip rice had a narrow path, and it was slightly tightened. The opening medium grade was 109 yuan and 105 yuan, the high ration rice was 112 yuan, the broken tip was 91 yuan, and the next was 88 yuan, which was 23 to 4 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous market. The back market was still rounded and shouted high, so the opening market today may once again cause competition for hoarding between internal and external customers, and the market may rise again, which is also unpredictable. However, in fact, the rice reserves are sufficient, and the shipping is as smooth as ever.

Foreign rice continues to arrive at the port. Those who arrived in recent days have already been reported in the previous reports. It is now known that the Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou wheel arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 25th and brought 10,446 bags of foreign rice from Siam. It was docked at the wharf of this bank in Pudong to unload. It is heard that a large number of Vietnamese rice are on their way to Shanghai. The French company's Laoyasi wheel is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month and the beginning of the month, carrying a large amount of foreign rice from the west. The exact number is not yet known. (Zu)

Although the supply of thick and thin indica rice in the country is still limited, there are many goods with water stains due to the heavy rain. Therefore, the cargo owners clearly see that foreign rice is soaring and have no power to hold it, but seek to sell it. The local shops and stomachs are still calm. As a result, the market price has not changed and is only stable. The open South Port fresh early and late rice is 1412 yuan to 140 yuan, the special is 145 yuan, and the Wuxi original package overnight indica is 132 yuan.

The path of glutinous rice is still not strong. Only a few rice porridge burdens have scattered stomachs, so it is difficult for Hong Kong Baiyuan to keep pace with foreign rice, and it is only slightly tightened. As for domestic glutinous rice, the source is cut off, and the market goods are also scarce. It has not been heard to open.

### Flour Market Rejuvenates: Demand in North China is Active and Japanese Merchants are Buying Heavily

Wheat Flour: Yesterday's spot western flour market was weak and then rejuvenated. At first, a lot of Golden Dragon flour was transferred from Hong Kong, and the market was not particularly excited. Later, due to the active demand in North China, Japanese merchants were buying heavily in the market. In addition, the news of the foreign exchange freeze caused the ball-kicking hoarders to favor it. The opening price of Golden Dragon flour was raised to 32.2 yuan and 34 cents. The closing price was slightly loose, making 32.25 yuan. The Bastion flour was 33.05 yuan to 30.35 yuan, the Double Eagle brand was 32 yuan, and the Clock Tower brand Australian flour was 33.5 yuan after weighing, which was 35 cents higher than before. The total transaction volume was more than 20,000 bags, and the market situation was still unstable.

Wheat: The new wheat source, a little bit of two to three hundred arrived at the port in the near suburbs, all of which were sent to the Japanese factory's retail outlets for collection, and the selling price was still around 41 yuan. The Chinese factory bought it at 47 yuan, but there was no spot to collect.

### The Foreign Exchange Market Has Changed and Everything Is Soaring

Red and White Rock Candy: Yesterday's sugar market was very good due to the US freezing Chinese and Japanese funds and the inability to buy and settle import exchange bills, which led to prices soaring. The association划盘, the initial spot price of 24 rough white June population was 97.5 yuan, and then it reached 99 yuan. The back market reached 101 yuan. The May import was 97 yuan and 98.5 yuan, and then it was 100 yuan and 0.8 jiao, an increase of 4.5 to 4.8 yuan. The April import was 97 yuan to 100 yuan, an increase of 5.5 yuan.

The NT mark was also 78 yuan to 82 yuan, an increase of 5.2 jiao. The KD mark was 78.5, 80, 82, and 84 yuan, an increase of 6.5 yuan. The ordinary Dutch cotton white was 94.5 yuan.

Oilseed Cake and Miscellaneous Grains: Yesterday's oil soybean cake market, due to the volatility of financial rumors, people's minds were firm, and speculative merchants took advantage of the trend to be active. As a result, the market was unanimously prosperous. As a result, edible oil rose by 34 yuan, soybeans rose by more than half a yuan, and soybean cake rose by 2 jiao. A total of 60 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were sold at a price of 145 yuan. 60 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, priced at 205 yuan to 207 yuan.

Matches, Candles, and Soap: Yesterday, the prices of daily necessities all soared. This was because the United States froze funds in the Far East, and people's minds suddenly became tense. Sellers tried their best to buy, and those who held the goods held up the prices. Most of them watched the situation and sold off, and only a few sold, which made the price even tighter. The purchase price of matches increased sharply. The market price rose sharply by more than 50 yuan compared to before. The Beautiful brand was 770 yuan per box, and the Phoenix brand was 760 yuan per box. The price of soap also increased slightly.

### The US and UK Freeze Chinese and Japanese Funds, Strengthening the Legal Tender Foundation. All Sectors Should Not Believe Rumors and Should Seek Calm. Legitimate Foreign Exchange Needs Will Still Be Supplied.

US President Roosevelt announced yesterday that he would freeze Japanese funds. The United Kingdom also adopted parallel action. Therefore, financial circles generally believe that this move by the United States is tantamount to severing relations with Japan and using the most effective economic sanctions to resist Japanese aggression. This move is absolutely beneficial to China. After four years of Japanese aggression against China, its economy is on the verge of exhaustion and it is suffering from an inability to support itself. Now that it has suffered this major blow, the consequences are even more unimaginable. As for the issue of the United States simultaneously freezing Chinese funds, according to financial circles, Shanghai is the financial center of the Far East, but it has already become an occupied area. If only Japanese funds are frozen, then the huge amount of foreign exchange in Shanghai will still fall into the hands of the Japanese. Therefore, China and Japan must be frozen simultaneously in order to take effect. Therefore, the US government, at China's request, took this action at the same time. Moreover, the foreign exchange of China that has been frozen, if approved by the government, will still be used for legitimate purposes, but the specific measures have not yet been announced.

Implement Restrictions and Stop All Payments

Since the US government announced the freezing of funds, American banks in this city have taken emergency measures to restrict foreign exchange of Japanese banks such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Chosen, Bank of Taiwan, and Chinese banks deposited in American banks, and all payments in US dollars have been suspended. All Chinese and Japanese banks wishing to withdraw foreign exchange must follow the following two temporary measures: (1) Chinese and Japanese banks and merchants withdrawing foreign exchange will only be paid with New York drafts by American banks. These drafts must be cashed in New York, and whether or not they can be cashed in New York will be determined by the US Treasury Department. (2) If Chinese and Japanese banks or merchants wish to withdraw US dollar deposits, they will not be paid in US dollars, but will be settled at market prices and paid in legal tender. As for British banks such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chartered Bank, they have also taken parallel actions with American banks regarding US dollar deposits. All foreign exchange of depositors from China and Japan will be paid with London drafts or converted at market prices and paid in legal tender in order to prevent the escape of frozen funds.

Japanese Commerce Suffers a Heavy Blow

Japan's main exports to the United States are silk products, totaling 50,000 yen per year. Its main exports to the United States are cotton textiles, totaling 400 million yen per year. The two total 900 million yen. The value of goods imported from the United Kingdom and the United States to Japan's Northeast Four Provinces and Kwantung is 50% of Japan's total imports. In the future, this trade will be completely cut off.

No Impact on China

However, some people are deeply concerned that after Chinese funds are frozen at the same time, China's import and export trade with the United States, the British Empire, South America, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies may be interrupted. Financial circles believe that the US freezing of Chinese funds is based on China's application, and this move is entirely to prevent Japan from arbitraging foreign exchange and is a fundamental solution. Moreover, before President Roosevelt issued the freeze order, the US Treasury Department had issued various licenses to take various precautionary measures after the commercial interruption between Hawaii and the Philippines and China and Japan. In addition, it also authorized a special license to fourteen well-known banks to handle import and export trade between any part of China (except the Northeast Four Provinces) and the United States, the British Empire, South America, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, it is firmly believed that this move by the United States will not affect China's foreign commercial relations, and the country that will be severely hit will be Japan alone.

Foreign Exchange Supply Adopts a License System

According to government bank sources yesterday, the measures taken by the British and American governments to freeze Chinese and Japanese funds were proposed to the US government by Mr. Fox, the American member of the Chinese Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, after returning to Hong Kong from Shanghai to discuss with other members. The British government also took the same steps to show its cooperation with the United States in response. It was found that Zhang Tao originally advocated maintaining the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai, but in the future, in order to protect legitimate trade between China, Britain, and the United States, foreign exchange will be supplied as much as possible to meet the legitimate needs of various industries, and a "license system" will be adopted to work closely with British and American commercial banks. All those requesting the supply of foreign exchange must state their reasons and may purchase it after approval, otherwise they will be rejected. This move is extremely unfavorable to Japanese speculators.

Consolidate Currency Confidence and Eliminate Conspiracies

Regarding the fluctuations in the Shanghai financial market caused by the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds by the United Kingdom and the United States, the entire Chinese finance remains as stable as ever. Moreover, the freezing of Chinese funds is in response to the request of Chairman Chiang, and after its implementation, it will make the credit of China's legal tender more consolidated. The import of necessities in the free area can still be applied for commercial exchange listed by the Central and Communications Banks, and legitimate merchants in Shanghai who need foreign exchange will also be supplied as much as possible. Therefore, it is hoped that all industries will remain calm and not worry excessively, and do not be confused by market rumors. Maintaining the legitimate business of legitimate merchants is the established policy of the Chinese government. In the future, the Shanghai foreign exchange market will be stable for a long time, so that conspirators cannot arbitrage foreign exchange and speculators can no longer use their old tricks. This kind of freezing measure makes the future of China's monetary system and finance very optimistic.

### Gas Surcharge Will Be Reduced Starting Next Month. The Surcharge Will Be Reduced by Ninety Percent. Reasonable Company Management Benefits the Public.

According to the information office of the Public Works Department, the Shanghai Gas Company's request to reduce the temporary gas surcharge from 250% to 160% has been discussed at a meeting of the Public Utilities Committee of this bureau and approved by the board of directors at its regular meeting. It is approved to be implemented from August 1 of this year and can be reconsidered at any time before the end of October of this year. During the period of rising prices, the company is able to reduce the surcharge partly because of the early completion of the bent-necked distiller. This measure allows most of the cheaper coal to be carbonized, thus reducing the cost of manufacturing gas. Furthermore, the increase in the use of this coal allows the company to increase the amount of coke available for sale, thereby increasing revenue. In addition, the income from the sale of surplus products also increases the company's income due to higher prices.

### Goods Detained on Guangdong Ship Belong to the Dutch Government. The Japanese Have Confirmed and Entrusted the Dutch Consul to Return Them to the Original Owner. Goods Detained on the Mueller Ship Are Being Unloaded One After Another.

The Shanghai Times reported that at a press conference hosted by the Japanese side yesterday (the 25th), Major Matsuda, the representative of Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama, the spokesperson of the Japanese Army, stated that the Japanese authorities had learned that the 900 tons of goods unloaded from the Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship were not the property of the Chongqing Central Government as previously suspected, but belonged to the Dutch government. Therefore, all the goods were entrusted to Mr. Bowden, the Dutch Consul General in Shanghai, yesterday to be returned to the original owner.

Misunderstanding Caused by Failure to Inspect

The Dutch government has admitted that the goods were detained due to the Dutch side's failure to inspect them by the Japanese authorities before being shipped out on British ships. These goods were cotton cloth and textile machines, packed in 739 boxes, totaling approximately 900 tons. They were returned unconditionally yesterday. The Guangdong ship was detained on July 10, and the goods on board were moved by the Japanese authorities to the godown for inspection. The ship sailed out last Saturday and Sunday.

Approximately 600 Tons of Goods Detained on the Mueller Ship

The spokesperson also stated that the goods on board the British ship Haida Mueller were unloaded yesterday and placed in the custody of the British authorities here. The ship carried approximately 500 to 600 tons of machinery and cotton cloth, which were being transported to Yangon and Calcutta.

The Japanese Side Believes They Belong to Chongqing

However, the Japanese side learned that these goods were actually being transported to Chongqing and decided to unload all the goods and hand them over to the Mueller Company for safekeeping, pending negotiations between the British and Japanese authorities. The export of goods on the ship should have been inspected by the Japanese authorities in advance. The unloading work began yesterday morning and is expected to be completed today (the 26th) or tomorrow (the 27th). It is reported that the Haida Mueller was originally berthed at Pujiang buoys 14 and 15, and was moved to the Company He Xiang Wharf yesterday so that the coolies hired by the Japanese side could unload the goods.

British Embassy Issues Statement

The British Embassy in this city issued a statement yesterday regarding the detention of the Guangdong ship and the Haida Mueller ship by the Japanese military, stating that the news published in the newspapers here regarding the goods on board the Guangdong ship and the Haida Mueller ship, which were unloaded at the request of the Japanese authorities, also included the statements of the Japanese naval spokesperson. The facts are now announced as follows: The textile machinery on board the Guangdong ship belonged to the Dutch East Indies authorities. The British Embassy did not know that it was forced to be unloaded. The Dutch government has declared that it should be responsible for the detention of the machinery because the machinery had not been inspected by the Japanese authorities before being loaded on the British merchant ship. However, this statement is not necessary in fact, because the goods in question have gone through customs formalities and there is no need to inspect them again. The opposition of the Japanese military police was raised after the goods in question had gone through customs formalities and started loading on the Guangdong ship. The detention of the Guangdong ship and the unloading of the goods on board occurred after the Dutch East Indies authorities had fully explained the ownership of the goods to the Japanese authorities. Regarding the Haida Mueller ship, the Japanese military police opposed the transportation of the goods to Hong Kong, Saigon, and Calcutta after all the goods had gone through customs formalities and completed loading. The goods were consigned to the Chinese in the above three places, and did not belong to Chongqing, and there was no need for the Japanese authorities to inspect them. The goods in question have been temporarily unloaded by the shipowner at the Gonghexiang Wharf until a definite decision is made.

### French Ship Schedules No Longer Announced. Shanghai-Vietnam Shipping Not Affected.

According to shipping industry sources, the French Shipping Company has recently kept the schedules of its ships secret and will no longer announce them in advance due to the sudden tightening of the situation in the Far East and due to environmental needs. However, the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping will not be affected by the severity of the situation. It is reported that the company's Da Danan ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Saigon, Little Luzon, and other places tomorrow (the 28th), and the Los ship is expected to transport rice from Vietnam to Shanghai at the end of this month.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Monopolized by Japan

Although there have been plans by the Chinese to organize a company to participate in shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, it has been rumored for a long time and has not been realized. At present, the only passenger ship operating between Shanghai and Ningbo is the Japanese-owned Mingfeng Maru. The ship travels between Shanghai and Ningbo on no fixed schedule. However, because the tonnage is very small, it cannot carry many passengers and goods. Each time it carries more than 100 passengers and the ticket price is quite high. The goods carried are only food and medicine needed by their army, and no other commercial goods are carried. Passengers are also limited to carrying 40 kilograms of luggage, so it is not beneficial to actual freight.

### Da Xin Restaurant Strike

The Da Xin Restaurant, which is attached to the Da Xin Company on Nanjing Road, originally had a tea room and a Cantonese cuisine department with dozens of employees. Recently, due to harsh treatment and opposition to the forced withdrawal of tips and customer rewards, they suddenly announced a strike yesterday. The labor unrest is still deadlocked.

### Tram Monthly and Seasonal Tickets Increase in Price Next Month. Increase by 50 Percent

Since the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramway Company in the Public Concession implemented price increases on the 14th of this month, half a month has passed. The price of monthly and seasonal tickets has increased by 50% compared to the previous price. The first-class adult monthly ticket is 32 yuan per ticket, the children under 16 years old is 16 yuan per ticket. If it is common to use two concessions, the adult is 48 yuan per ticket, and the children is 24 yuan per ticket. The company has now started selling.

### New Japanese Shipping Regulations Have No Clear Provisions. Japan Mail Society Still Sells Tickets to Japan. The Other Two Companies Have Temporarily Suspended Sales.

Japanese Embassy Claims Unaware of Behind-the-Scenes Reasons

The Zi Lin Pao reported that the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy stated at a press conference here yesterday (the 26th) that Shanghai is unaware of the new regulations and schedules of the Japanese shipping companies operating shipping between Shanghai and Japan and North China, so he has inquired and clarified them. At present, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (Japan Mail Society) still sells tickets to Japan, but the Toa Kaiun Kaisha (East Asia Shipping Company) does not. The Dalian Steamship Company also does not sell tickets to Japan, but tickets to Qingdao are still issued. All Japanese shipping branch offices in Shanghai are acting in accordance with the orders of their domestic head offices. As for the behind-the-scenes reasons for implementing these new regulations, the Japanese Embassy and the naval spokesperson are unaware. According to the statement, in order to end the Sino-Japanese War, shipping schedules should of course be changed due to military needs. The two matters of the Japanese side summoning reserve soldiers in Shanghai and the new shipping regulations are not related.

### Bean and Rice Association Announced Yesterday That Food Reserves Are Sufficient. Total Rice Reserves in the City Reach More Than 2.1 Million Bags, Enough to Meet Needs Before August, and There Is No Worry of Scarcity in the Future.

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association's 121st rice reserve survey, which began last Friday, was finally completed yesterday due to continuous heavy rain, which made progress difficult. According to the report, the total rice reserves in Chinese and foreign godowns in this period (from last Thursday to this Thursday) reached 1,274,552 bags, an increase of 74,755 bags compared to the previous period. However, the rice and grain shipped from home and abroad in the past two days were not included in the survey because they were still being unloaded and entered the godown.

Rice Reserves in Each Godown Have Doubled Compared to the Previous Period

The rice reserve investigation in this period includes Pudong, Hongkou, and the Central District, covering approximately 90 Chinese and foreign rice godowns. Among them, Roosevelt, Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, Gonghexiang, Shuntai, Longmao Company, China Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, China, and Communications Bank godowns are the most significant, with an average of 20,000 bags of rice stored in each godown. Last year on this day, there were only more than 70 rice godowns in the city, and the rice reserves were only between 400,000 and 500,000 bags. The Bean and Rice Association has now submitted the survey results to the authorities of the two concessions and the seven rice industry groups for record.

Sufficient Grain Reserves in the City for August

It is reported that the above-mentioned rice reserves only belong to the Chinese and foreign godowns. However, the retail sales and storage of rice numbers, residents' advance purchases and storage, and the food groups that have ordered and transported them to Shanghai are all included in this survey. According to accurate estimates, the grain reserves have now exceeded 800,000 bags. Therefore, the entire food reserves in the city have now surged to more than 2.1 million bags. At present, the daily rice consumption in the city is still about 10,000 piculs, which has not increased compared to the past. The grain reserves in the city are sufficient for the needs of the city's residents for more than eight months, and the domestic and foreign sources are still continuing. There is no shortage of food in the future.

Effective Measures Strictly Enforced

The rice industry groups in this city were previously ordered by the authorities of the two concessions to quickly ban various illegal transactions in the rice market: (1) All spot transactions are allowed in the same industry, and no empty buying and selling are allowed. (2) Those participating in market transactions are strictly prohibited from reselling and raising prices for profit. (3) Once the grain transaction is completed, both the buyer and seller must issue a receipt for verification. It is learned that the two authorities will continue to strictly enforce these effective measures, and all rice merchants must abide by the regulations in the market and must not act contrary to them. Otherwise, they will be severely punished according to the established regulations.

### Mitchell Resigns from the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department. Hurley Has Been Appointed as His Successor.

According to the information office of the Public Works Department, Mr. Mitchell, a director of this bureau, has resigned from the board of directors due to his imminent departure from Shanghai, which has been approved. Mr. Hurley has been appointed as his successor.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Applications Are Becoming More Enthusiastic. Dance Queen Wang Ying Encourages Colleagues to Respond.

Since the application for this newspaper's scholarship for readers began a few days ago, those who have come to the museum to obtain forms have been very enthusiastic. Yesterday alone, there were six to seven hundred people, and more than one hundred copies were filled out and sent. However, there are three points that need to be clarified, please pay attention to the students of each school.

Please Do Not Apply If You Do Not Meet the Requirements

(1) This newspaper's scholarship will adopt absolutely strict methods. Applicants who feel that their academic performance and conduct do not meet the requirements of Article 2 of the regulations should not try, so as not to waste their precious time.

In the future, please do not certify any unqualified requests from the principals of each school.

This newspaper has already stated that applicants must come to the museum in person to pick up the forms, and requests by mail are invalid.

Dance Girl Readers Donate Flower Powder Fees

Ms. Wang Ying from Yongqing Lane, Ai'er Road, wrote a letter saying, "I lost my education in my childhood, and I work as a dancer when I grew up. Under the lights and wine, I deeply feel the pain of lacking knowledge. However, I like to read newspapers and regard myself as one of the loyal readers of the real report. I read it every day, which enriches my experience. Recently, your newspaper has set up a scholarship for readers to benefit the poor and bless the society. I admire it very much. Now I will save 10 yuan from my flower powder expenses. I hope you will not laugh at it. I think there are no less than thousands of dancing sisters in the city. If they can all realize this and take this into consideration, a huge number can be raised. I hope your newspaper will work hard to advocate and promote its realization."

### Shanghai's Response After the Freezing of Funds. All Estimates Seem Premature.

US President Roosevelt issued an order yesterday morning to freeze Japanese assets in the United States, and the British government immediately followed suit, freezing Japanese funds within the British Empire. The result has brought a large part of world commerce to a standstill. As soon as the US President announced the freeze, he immediately issued various licenses to prevent the interruption of trade between Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan and China, and granted special licenses to fourteen well-known banks, allowing them to assist merchants engaged in import and export trade in any part of China (except the Northeast Four Provinces) and the American Republics, British territories, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch Indies.

The business community in this city had expected a freeze order to be issued for more than a day. Now that it has been realized, the Shanghai exchange market suddenly saw a surge in the purchase of US dollars, causing the exchange rate to tighten. Exchange market speculators had long positions of approximately US$3 million and short positions of US$2 million. From this, it can be seen that the short positions are tight and they have to try their best to cover, regardless of the exchange rate. Because the banks in this city can no longer cover US dollars in New York, they have stopped spot and futures trading of US dollars, only settling long positions and not providing assistance to short positions.

The black market, which sees the exchange market as a shift, has very little spot trading, and the futures trading is huge. Both the spot and futures prices have risen higher than the closing price of the previous day. The price of yarn has also become firmer, because everyone expects it to be difficult to import raw cotton in the future. As of yesterday afternoon, it was still unknown what special regulations would apply to Shanghai under the freeze measures and how importers of rice, cotton, and other items would prove that their requests were legitimate. However, there is no doubt that American banks will grant permission to merchants and importers who can prove that their activities do not conflict with American interests.

As for what degree of consideration the US authorities will give to the personal needs of those who have deposits in US banks, it is also unknown. At present, it is also too early to estimate the far-reaching impact of the US and British freeze orders on the Far East and the situation that will occur in the Pacific. However, there is no doubt that Japan's economic system is already heavily burdened by the increasing consumption of the Sino-Japanese War, and will be stretched even further in the future. It should rein in its horses before it is too late to avoid a tragedy.

As for the speculative activities in the black market and the US dollar market in this city, they will naturally disappear in the future. There were no transactions in the stock market yesterday, so it is not possible to know exactly how Shanghai merchants will react to the freeze order. However, according to analysts, since Shanghai's floating capital has lost its outlet in the future, it is expected to flood into the stock market again, so stock prices are expected to rise tomorrow. It seems that there is no imminent danger of a Pacific war breaking out. The business community and speculators also hold this view. It is unpredictable, and judging from the situation in other markets, it seems that no one expects the United States and Japan to go to war in the short term. (Wei Zhong)

### British Air Force Association Banquet Flags with the Letter V Hanging Everywhere

The Shanghai British Royal Air Force Association held a luncheon at its clubhouse at 30 Fuzhou Road the day before yesterday to entertain American dignitaries in this city. Those who attended included President Hallen, former President Sir Sassoon, Alexander, the head of the information office of the British Embassy, and George, the British Consul General. Those who attended from the American side included American Consul General Lockhart, and Lawton, Beal, and Smith. Flags with the letter V were hung everywhere in the venue, which was inspiring. The Shanghai V-letter movement was officially discovered in public places, starting with the luncheon of the Royal Air Force Association. Hallen first gave a speech during the meeting, expressing his welcome to the American guests, because the United States has doubled its aircraft production capacity in the past six months, which has enabled the Royal Air Force to establish its dominant position in controlling the sky. We are welcoming the coming of victory, and the future of democracy is limitless. Lockhart then gave an informal reply, praising the greatness of American military production and saying that if anyone evades responsibility, there will be no satisfactory results today.

### Illegal Transactions in the Coal Market Should Be Banned Urgently

In the Coal Industry Association market at 405 Tianjin Road, unscrupulous coal merchants were active in the market, causing the entire coal market to become loose and tight, and the price of flue-cured coal was fluctuating. The industry association has repeatedly issued notices strictly prohibiting various illegal transactions by the industry in the market. The reporter recently learned from people familiar with the coal market that those speculative coal merchants are still secretly active in the market, taking the opportunity to buy up various spot and futures goods at low prices, and then selling them at high prices on the spot in order to obtain illegal profits. This affects the entire coal market and is not insignificant. It is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions responsible for suppressing prices will ban them as soon as possible. The coal industry association is watching from the sidelines and does not ask, which is difficult to shirk the blame.

### Two Sailing Ships Sailing from Zhenhai to Dinghai Were Robbed. Women Were Forced to Be Humiliated.

Recently, sailing ships sailing from Zhen to Dinghai often encounter pirates. On the 21st of this month, two sailing ships carrying more than 50 passengers sailed from Daqi Tou, Zhenhai to Dinghai Zhoushan. When sailing to the ocean in the middle of the journey, they suddenly encountered two pirate ships, which intercepted the sailing ships and carried out searches. All the legal tender clothes and items carried by the passengers were robbed, and even a few liters of broad beans were robbed. Two women and a 12-year-old girl were dragged to the pirate ship and forcibly humiliated before the ship was released. It was found that these passengers were all transferred from Yong to Dinghai to Shanghai. When they arrived in Zhoushan, the girl who was humiliated by the pirates was still walking unsteadily and suffered a lot.

### 國際戀愛之悲劇　廣東少女殉情　與美水兵熱戀傾心相事　兵別所有眷女痛心自殺

Tragedy of an International Romance: Cantonese Girl Commits Suicide. Madly in Love with an American Sailor, Heartbroken by His Departure, the Girl Despairs and Kills Herself.

Luo Lili, a young woman from Guangdong, 19 years old, fluent in English, residing at 15 Jikang Lane, Xinzha Road, worked as a waitress at the Carter Hotel at 7 Carter Road, earning a monthly salary of 70 yuan, plus commissions from sales, so her monthly income was quite substantial. She had no siblings, and her entire family depended on her for support.

Depressed After Being Heartbroken

Miss Luo met an American sailor, developed a friendship, and then fell in love. It had been 15 months. The girl was deeply in love, but good times don't last. The sailor had recently fallen in love with someone else and wrote to Luo to break up. The girl was unhappy after receiving the letter and took her own life.

Secretly Goes to a Hotel and Takes Poison Behind Closed Doors

She left home at 3:00 PM on the 23rd and did not return. Her family was searching everywhere. Unexpectedly, at 5:45 PM on the 25th, Miss Luo went alone to the Weida Hotel at 993 Avenue Joffre, used the alias "Guo," opened room 10, made a phone call, returned to her room, and drank poison to commit suicide. After taking the poison, she lay on the bed waiting to die.

Past Saving, She Died

At 9:00 PM, a man went to find her, knocked on the door but received no answer. The tea attendant pried the door open and discovered her. He immediately called an ambulance and sent her to the Tiren Hospital on Route Lafayette, but it was too late to save her. Her family sent the body to the Paradise Funeral Parlor. The French police received a report and sent the body to the autopsy room yesterday morning. After the examination, her sister, Luo Runhua (26 years old), claimed the body and took it back for burial.

Before Committing Suicide, She Told a Friend to Collect Her Body

According to another report, the girl took poison and committed suicide in the room that evening. Initially, the hotel authorities were unaware. Around 10:00 PM, a guest suddenly arrived with French police officers and pried open the door, only to find that the girl had died. They summoned a car to send the body to the autopsy room. It was later learned that the sudden arrival of the police officers was because the guest had received a phone call from the girl before her suicide, instructing him to go and collect her body and informing him that she had taken poison. Therefore, the guest reported to the police and went to check, only to find that she had indeed committed suicide.

### 誰是你的摯友

Who is Your Best Friend?

— Wan

I can assert that every child has many friends. Among these friends, there are varying degrees of closeness, and surely there is a friend who is the closest and dearest to you, whom I would call your best friend. Little friends believe that a best friend is someone who often gives you your favorite things to eat or play with. It's someone with whom you share the same interests. For instance, you both like to bounce a ball, so you become best friends from bouncing a ball together every day. It's someone with whom you often eat, drink, and play, and through familiarity, you become best friends. But if you never return things to them, they won't willingly associate with you; if you are unable to bounce a ball with them for several days due to an event or illness, then they will gradually drift away from you; if your parents don't give you money to eat and drink with your best friend, they won't let you freeload all the time. These kinds of friends, in ordinary times, certainly have very engaging conversations, eating, drinking, and playing together, and getting along happily. But if you ever disagree or have a conflict of interest, you'll each go your own way. Some will even hate each other for it. Or if you have extreme difficulties that you can't resolve, they won't care about your problems. Is this kind of person your best friend?

Then who is your best friend? Perhaps it's the person you consider the most annoying! They often point out your faults, urge you to improve, care about your studies and behavior. When you make a mistake, they feel bad for you. When you have difficulties, they help you resolve them. On ordinary days, they may not necessarily hang out with you and your friends, but they are always paying attention to your actions, hoping that you strive to improve.

Children are young and inexperienced and can't clearly recognize who their best friend is. They think that the person they often play with or the person who once helped them, regardless of their character or academic performance, is their best friend. After getting along for too long, your behavior also gets tainted. I have personally seen many children learn vulgar language and do indecent things because of bad friendships. Joining gangs, fighting…it's just endless. Children, think carefully. Not recognizing clearly and being careless in making friends is so dangerous!

Finally, I advise all children! A best friend isn't a drinking and eating friend, a playing friend, or an interests-based friend. It's someone who can advise you and hopes that you improve. That's your true best friend. As for interests-based friends, as long as they are well-behaved and also excellent children, then it's fine to make several of them. But you must be clear about who your best friend is. After recognizing them clearly, you should often be close to them and accept their good intentions.

### 晏平仲的機警

Yan Pingzhong's Wit

— Cheng

During the Spring and Autumn period, there was a high official in the State of Qi, named Yan Pingzhong, who was only three feet tall and dressed very plainly, but his talent was superior to others.

One day, the ruler of Qi sent him as an envoy to the State of Chu to improve diplomatic relations. As usual, when a minister of one state is sent to another to improve diplomatic relations, the etiquette of receiving the envoy should be extremely grand. However, the King of Chu knew that he was a short man, so he deliberately made a joke of him. The royal palace clearly had a main gate, but the King of Chu specially opened a small door next to the main gate. When Yan Pingzhong arrived at the palace gate, the guide deliberately led him through the small door. His intention was none other than to mock Yan Pingzhong for being a short man, who didn't need to use the main gate. He then said to the guide, "This is a dog hole! I am going to the State of Chu, not entering the palace of a dog country. Why should I go through this dog hole?" The guide didn't expect him to scold him so harshly, so he had to report to the King of Chu, who reopened the main gate and invited him in.

The King of Chu knew about this matter, of course, and was very ashamed. After a while, Pingzhong walked in, and the King of Chu lazily gave Pingzhong a greeting and immediately said, "Could it be that there are no people in your country?" Yan Pingzhong calmly replied, "In the city of Linzi, Qi, people rub shoulders in the streets, and if everyone sweats at once, it can form rain. How can you say there are no people?" The King of Chu said, "Then why did you send someone like you to our dignified State of Chu?" Pingzhong replied, "Our country has rules for sending envoys. Generally, when sending envoys to large countries, we always send great men! When sending envoys to small countries, we send people like me!" The King of Chu wanted to ridicule him, but unexpectedly, he was laughed at instead, and he had to endure it in his heart.

Later, the King of Chu held a banquet for Pingzhong. Suddenly, a prisoner was brought up from the steps. The King of Chu deliberately asked those around him, "What crime did this person commit?" Those around him replied, "This is a person from the State of Qi who committed theft." Thereupon, the King of Chu looked at Yan Pingzhong mockingly and said, "Ah! Is it true that people from the State of Qi are accustomed to being robbers?" Yan Pingzhong said calmly, "The same orange tree bears oranges when it's in the south of the Huai River, but when it's moved to the north of the Huai River, it bears trifoliate oranges. Just now, a criminal didn't commit robbery in our country, but as soon as he came to your country, he engaged in robbery and theft. Speaking of which, I should thank your country's good education!"

The King of Chu was very ashamed and used the courtesy for distinguished guests to deal with him!

### 吃凉粉

Eating Jelly

— Yang Chunlu

It was an afternoon in the heat of summer, and the weather was as hot as if someone had a fever. The younger brother kept whining about wanting to eat popsicles. Mom said, "Popsicles are too cold. Why don't you buy some agar-agar, and we'll make some jelly to try, okay?"

The younger brother happily said, "Okay!" After saying that, he went to buy agar-agar.

They started making the jelly: First, they took one tael of agar-agar and soaked it in cold water to wash it clean. Then, they took four ounces of white sugar and dissolved it in two bowls of boiling water, and boiled it in a pot. When the sugar had dissolved, they added the agar-agar and stirred it until the agar-agar had dissolved and mixed with the water into a gelatinous state. Then, they filtered out any impurities from the sugar and agar-agar, and waited for it to cool halfway, then they added three or four spoons of fruit syrup and continued to let it cool. After an hour, it had congealed into a transparent, creamy, cool soup.

So, they shared it and tasted it. The younger brother ate and said, "This jelly is sweet, fragrant, and refreshing. It's really delicious!"

Mom said, "Jelly is certainly delicious, but don't forget what the raw materials for making jelly are." The younger brother said, "Isn't it the good agar-agar I bought?"

Mom said, "That's right. Well, how is agar-agar made?" "…"

Mom also said, "Agar-agar is a domestic food. It is made from a type of red seaweed called 'stone flower vegetables.' It is boiled into a solution, filtered to decolorize it, evaporated to concentrate it, and then left to cool and congeal. It is then cut into thin strips and dried, and it becomes the agar-agar sold in the market. Agar-agar can not only be used to make jelly, but it is also a dish that we often eat!"

### 打針

Getting a Shot

— Jin Jian

When Ah Hui's father saw the following news in the newspaper: "Cholera is in danger of spreading in the city. An epidemic has occurred in the slum areas of the concession, with many deaths. Therefore, every resident must be vaccinated against the epidemic. After vaccination, one can be immune to the epidemic for four months. In the following weeks, cholera is expected to expand and spread, so those who have not been vaccinated must be vaccinated immediately." After that, he went to invite a familiar doctor to prepare vaccinations for everyone in the family.

"Dad, why can cholera kill people?" Ah Hui asked about the two unfamiliar words "cholera."

"Cholera is a disease that is especially easy to get in the summer, and it can be contagious, so this kind of epidemic disease is very scary. If you get this disease, you will vomit, have diarrhea, and develop a fever. It's even more dangerous within a day or two, and soon the patient will die. That's because cholera is caused by a cholera germ that gets into our mouths from flies and other unclean and uncooked vegetables. These germs are very small and alive. Once they enter the body, they invade the bloodstream and produce a kind of poison that destroys the blood. This person can't live."

"Then why do we need to get a shot?" Ah Hui felt that getting a shot was very painful. He had gotten a shot last year, and it didn't seem to do any good, so he brought up this question and asked his father.

"Getting a vaccination can prevent the occurrence of epidemic diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever, which means you won't get this kind of dangerous disease anymore."

But what his father answered wasn't really what he meant, so he asked again, "Why can a vaccination prevent epidemic diseases?"

"Do you know how the glue-like stuff in the vaccination is made?" His father asked him back. Ah Hui shook his head, indicating that he didn't know.

His father then continued, "This stuff is called a vaccine. There are many kinds of them, and each kind of vaccine can prevent a certain disease. For example, to prevent cholera, you only need to get a cholera vaccine. Like to prevent smallpox, you have to get a cowpox vaccination. Cowpox is also a kind of vaccine. The manufacture of this kind of vaccine took a lot of research by medical scientists to succeed. First, cholera germs are planted in the bodies of strong animals, like cows, horses, rabbits, etc. When the germs come into contact with the animal's body, they naturally invade the animal's blood as well, but the animal's resistance is strong, not afraid of the poison released by the germs, and instead goes to destroy them, which can reduce the degree of toxicity, or kill the germs. Then the doctor takes it down, and after some sterilization, refines it into various vaccines. Injecting this kind of vaccine into the human body can increase the body's ability to kill bacteria, so you don't have to worry about getting this kind of disease again."

One day, the doctor who gave vaccinations really came. Ah Hui willingly let the doctor pierce his tender skin with the long, sharp needle. He only felt a little swelling and pain, because he already understood what the effects of getting a vaccination were, unlike last year. They took turns getting shots one by one. Finally, it was the old nanny's turn, but she cleared her throat and said, "I've already had this cholera vomiting and diarrhea disease before. I don't need to get another shot this year." She insisted on not getting the shot, and only a small amount of the vaccine was injected. This aroused Ah Hui's surprise again. "What's the reason for this?" he asked the doctor.

"Because she has had cholera, her body has produced an antitoxin that resists cholera germs, which can kill these germs, and there is even some of this antitoxin left over in her body, so she can get fewer injections of the vaccine. If this kind of germ is found in her body a second time, the remaining antitoxin can immediately kill them, and she won't get this kind of disease again."

### 兒童圖書館參觀記

A Visit to the Children's Library

— Zhang Xixian, Ziqiang Elementary School

The day before yesterday, I saw a piece of news about the opening of the Children's Library in the education news column of the Shen Bao. At that time, I was very happy, and I planned to go to the library with my older brother for a visit. Yesterday after dinner, my older brother and I set off from Putuo Road, turned onto Gordon Road, and went to the library on Dahua Road.

It took us more than half an hour to walk to the library. There were many people at the entrance, pouring in like a tide. We also squeezed into the crowd and went in.

The facilities in the library were indeed very perfect. The bookshelves were against the walls, and the books inside were arranged very neatly. Underneath was a row of benches, and the children were all sitting and reading books, with happy smiles on their faces, but the order was also very good. On the walls hung two maps, one was a map of China's current situation, and the other was a map of the world's current situation. There were many photos hanging on the walls, including a posthumous portrait of Madame Chen, the mother of Ji'an Zhou, and photos of the board of directors. There were photos of great men, including Sun Zhongshan, Yue Fei, Confucius, Washington, Edison, Lincoln, etc., to whom we paid our respects. The staff members of the library were all very kind and approachable, with smiling faces. I chose a few books to read, such as biographies of Columbus and Baden-Powell, and rhetoric for writing. The content was indeed very good and very suitable for the psychology of us children. After a while, I looked up and saw that the long and short hands on the clock were pointing in the middle of six and twelve, so I came out with the people and went home with my older brother.

### 在人多的地方為什麼很易頭痛？（下）

Why is it Easy to Get a Headache in Crowded Places? (Part 2)

— Ah Mao

Some people think that because we exhale carbon dioxide and need oxygen, when many people gather in a room, the amount of carbon dioxide slowly increases and there isn't enough oxygen, which causes headaches. This statement is also incorrect. Carbon dioxide itself is not poisonous, and people won't get sick from inhaling carbon dioxide. But according to experience, in crowded places, if the amount of carbon dioxide increases, the temperature in the room will definitely increase as well, which is harmful to our health. Therefore, ventilation machines in public places still use carbon dioxide as a standard to adjust the air.

In short, the reason why it is easy to get a headache in crowded places is because the temperature around us is too high, which prevents our body from releasing excess heat. It's the same reason why you get heatstroke from walking under the hot sun in the summer, and why we get headaches from sitting in a room with the windows closed and a very hot stove in the winter.

### It is rumored that Wu Suqiu will appear on the silver screen

— Bei Shi

Wu Suqiu is a talented figure in the Peking opera world. Because of her beautiful appearance and good social skills, she caused a sensation and captivated many opera lovers when she first performed at the Xinsheng Stage last year. At that time, the Guolian Film Company had planned to invite her to shoot a "Peking Opera Film," but it was abandoned due to unmet conditions.

Jin Xinmin of Minhua is very fond of Peking opera. He often feels that if reasonable improvements are made, the future of Peking opera will not be difficult to develop and expand. Fei Mu also shares the same view as Jin Xinmin. Therefore, the recently completed "Song of Ancient China" was filmed using cinematic techniques. Now, the Meicheng Factory stipulates that Jin Xing will spend one and a half months shooting a play starting from August 1st, and then Minhua will also spend one and a half months shooting a play. In this way, there will be no conflict in terms of time and space. After receiving this suggestion, the Minhua authorities, after consultation, felt that it would be too late to shoot a newly compiled script. Therefore, they planned to shoot a "Peking Opera Film" like "Song of Ancient China." Then they thought of Wu Suqiu, who caused a sensation last year.

However, there are many problems. If she is invited alone from Beiping to Shanghai to film, not only will there be no supporting actors, but also, according to the custom of the opera world, all travel expenses and accommodation expenses after arriving in Shanghai will be borne by the company, which is not cost-effective. Therefore, the best hope is that Wu Suqiu can come to Shanghai to perform, so that negotiations can be carried out conveniently, and the burden will be reduced a lot.

### A glimpse of Cangzhou Bookstore

— Yu Xiu

This year, the business of Guangyu Bookstore has seen significant development. The Zhongchang branch of Dongfang Bookstore has not been open for long, and now the new-style Cangzhou Bookstore has followed closely.

Cangzhou Bookstore is located in Cangzhou Hotel. The place is quiet and the transportation is convenient. It is undoubtedly the most ideal bookstore. Now, "Qinglong File" has early, day, and night sessions, simultaneously refreshing the audience's ears and eyes with a brand-new posture and strong lineup. The author visited the day session one day.

The bookstore is arranged in a south-facing rectangular living room. The seats are uniform white canvas chairs. The area is not large, but the audience sits extremely comfortably. Facing a green lawn, surrounded by a wide corridor, the long windows are open, the cool breeze is blowing, the air is fresh, and the light is harmonious, so sitting for a while does not feel stuffy or tired.

The day session is entirely storytelling with stringed instruments. Presumably, because of the location, there are particularly many female listeners, so there is no Pinghua show. The first act, "Zhu Zhao's Love Affair of Laughter and Tears," needs no introduction. Everyone has already heard it so well on the radio and in bookstores, and they know it very clearly. Jiang Yuequan in the second act has not been famous for long, so his articulation and performance are still lacking in sophistication. He must work with Zhou Yuquan to achieve the wonderful effect of a perfect match. Performing alone now will inevitably suffer a great discount. Xue Xiaoqing in the third act, after splitting up with Shen Jian'an, changed to being an upper hand. His narration and expressions cannot get rid of the "side flower" (lower hand) nature. What is worth noting is his current lower hand, Pang Xueqing. Pang studied under Xue Xiaoqing and has a naturally good voice. His pronunciation is clear and his singing is full of twists and turns, with a promising blue-out-of-blue appearance. A few years ago, he and Ni Pingqian teamed up, and the "Ni Pang Team" was hailed as a rising star and became famous for a while. After the breakup, they became destitute and could not return to their former glory. Now almost no one mentions his name anymore. Such is the fate of entertainers, often like this, which is a sigh!

Overall, the layout and lineup of Cangzhou Bookstore have undergone careful consideration and deserve the praise of being exquisite. Therefore, since its opening, the results have been satisfactory, and the audience has never declined, which has to be said to be a gratifying thing in Shanghai's entertainment industry.

Chapter Thirteen: Refusing to Bow to the Bandits

When Liu Yinying returned home this time; thinking that his aunt had already passed away, it was like a dream, and he felt a little sad. So, he and Xu Jing went to the Guanwang Temple on Shijiao Peak to visit the wise old monk to thank him for his help and to discuss the burial. Because Liu Yinying's uncle had been buried in Weifeng Mountain after his death, he was of course buried in the same cave now. The wise old monk chose an auspicious day for them and carried out the matter. All the earthworkers were handled by the wise old monk, which saved Liu Yinying a lot of energy. Liu Yinying thanked him a few words and retreated. Because Xu Jing's shoulder injury had not healed, Liu Yinying told him to go to bed early. The two horses were kept in the back garden for future use. From then on, Liu Yinying stayed on the mountain to observe the funeral, and Xu Jing recuperated his shoulder injury. For several days in a row, there was silence and nothing happened. Xu Jing's heart was always thinking about the past bloody battles in Dai County and Ningwu, lamenting the martyrdom of Wang Yongtai and Zhou Yuji for the country, and feeling that he really owed them too much. Therefore, when he chatted with Liu Yinying, he was saddened by the precarious state of the country. True patriots were preparing for battle, and the autumn of hearing the rooster crowing and rising to dance. General Zhou sacrificed himself to become a hero, and he was worthy of the country. His family was loyal and righteous, and he would naturally be recorded in history. He himself was unwilling to give up, and he had to continue to work hard, find another place to establish meritorious service, and lay the groundwork for repaying the country in the future. Liu Yinying naturally agreed with his statement, because now that his aunt was dead, he was alone and had nothing to miss. He could go anywhere in the world. Xu Jing also remembered that when Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei separated at Li Xinzhuang in Qi County before, they had gone to Wu Sangui, the general of Shanhaiguan, to join the army. He wondered what their situation was now. It was rumored that Wu Sangui was also a hero of the time, holding the tiger talisman and shouldering the important task of the frontier. At this time of turmoil in the world and the collapse of the building, he would definitely take heroic actions, issue orders to recruit talents, and make plans to stabilize the world in order to save his people from fire and water. Since he had nowhere to settle for the time being, why not go there and choose a tree to perch on, and also give long-separated friends the opportunity to meet again? So, he revealed this idea to Liu Yinying, hoping to invite Liu Yinying to take a trip outside the pass with him. (126)

### Talking about Zheng Bingru's Dramatic Art

— Wu Sou

I have always liked watching dramas, but I am a layman in this field. The other night, I went to the Golden Theater to watch Zheng Bingru's masterpiece, "Peach Blossom." In my opinion, the whole drama is very tight. And Zheng Ling's pronunciation and singing can be described as round and smooth, and her posture and stage steps are all excellent. With the addition of Mr. Yu Zhenfei's Zhang Daonan, the peony and green leaves are all beautiful. Last year, Zheng Ling performed at the Xinsheng. When I watched her "Imperial Stele Pavilion," I saw the danger of her slipping on the muddy road when she went to the pavilion to avoid the rain, and the fearful posture when she was tried and punished in the three halls. Also, when she closed the kiln door in Fenhe Bay and listened to her husband outside the kiln telling about his past hardships, her sobbing and crying were rarely matched. Since then, whenever female actors come to Shanghai to perform the above-mentioned plays, I always go to see them one by one. However, those with outstanding reputations have not performed as beautifully as her. In addition, I don't know if Zheng Ling's masterpiece "Live Capture of Wang Kui" can be performed to satisfy the people of Shanghai and see her again. With this talent, if she studies further and performs in line with the true meaning of the plot, I am afraid that no female actor can compete with her.
