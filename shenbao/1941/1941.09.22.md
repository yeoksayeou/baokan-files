### The Chinese Army Completes a Grand Encirclement; Fierce Fighting Unfolds on the South Bank of the Miluo River; 100,000 Troops Firmly Defend the Line from Xiangyin to Shaji; Important Points Like Guanwang Bridge Are Recaptured

Chongqing – Although Japanese troops are rapidly advancing towards Changsha, the Chinese Supreme Command expresses complete confidence in the strength of the Chinese army to defend the capital of Hunan Province. According to recent Chinese war dispatches, the Japanese army has crossed the Miluo River and is continuing to advance southward. Chinese sources report that the vanguard of the Japanese force currently numbers 40,000, with reinforcements still arriving. It is estimated that the Japanese are deploying approximately five or six divisions in the current offensive. After crossing the Xinqiang River, the Japanese army, with heavy artillery cover, crossed the Miluo River yesterday morning, south of it, on the north bank of it. Fierce fighting is currently underway on the south bank of the Miluo River. At the same time, Japanese aircraft are bombing the rear of the Chinese army, including Changsha, Pingjiang, and Xiangyin.

Chongqing – Fierce fighting has broken out on the south bank of the Miluo River. There are struggles for control in the areas of Guiyi, Xinshi, and Wukou. The Japanese troops crossing south over the Miluo River numbered only a few yesterday; the main force has fully arrived. Currently, 100,000 fresh Chinese troops have completed a grand encirclement formation on the line from north of Changsha to Pingjiang and Xiangyin, and are about to launch an annihilation battle. (Dispatch from the 21st)

Chongqing – According to a war dispatch announced by the Military Affairs Commission, the Japanese army in northern Hunan crossed the Miluo River on the morning of the 20th, with a force exceeding 40,000, appearing to be attacking Changsha. According to informed sources, the Japanese are determined to use over 100,000 troops in this decisive battle, with their target perhaps reaching as far as Hengyang, in order to cut off transportation in the Chinese interior. Last month, when the Japanese army added a division to their forces in Yueyang, the military spokesman reported that the Japanese might be planning to attack Changsha. The Chinese authorities have undoubtedly made preparations in this regard. Moreover, Hengyang has convenient transportation, and it would not be difficult for troops from nearby war zones to rush to its aid. Therefore, observers say that if Hengyang is a must-defend location, then a major battle, unseen since the Battle of Wuhan, may soon occur in the Changsha-Hengyang area. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)

### A Record of Observing the Solar Eclipse in Chongqing: The Sky Was Gloomy, Leaving Only a Line Resembling a New Moon; Old Habits Die Hard, There Were Still Sounds of Gongs and Drums

Chongqing – Chongqing has been experiencing cloudy and rainy weather for weeks. Only last night did it show signs of clearing up. This morning, it did not rain, and the sunlight occasionally broke through the clouds. At first, it was thought that the pleasure of the viewers would be limited, but in fact, it greatly helped the general public to watch with the naked eye. The bright sun was obscured by light clouds, and the light was weak, so reporters could observe the progress of the eclipse without any instruments or equipment. The initial eclipse was just after 10 AM. At 11:55, only a line remained. The so-called crescent-shaped eyebrow was not as thin as it was described. The astronomical forecast said that nine-tenths of the solar eclipse could be seen, which was very accurate. The recovery period was at 12:15. This was the reporter's observation with the naked eye and had nothing to do with science. The solar eclipse time was no different from a normal cloudy day. The sound of people banging drums arose sporadically. This proves that old habits die hard, but it also proves that science has gradually become more widespread. The broadcast from Lintao was not clear, so detailed information will have to wait for a later report. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)

Chongqing – Today's solar eclipse is the first time in 398 years that China has had a chance to see a total eclipse. People from all walks of life are prepared to observe the solar eclipse. The enthusiastic atmosphere almost makes one disbelieve that they are still in the midst of a bitter struggle. The government has dispatched two observation teams to the Northwest and Southeast, with the Northwest team as the main team, engaging in recording, photography, and observing high-altitude and geomagnetic changes in Lintao, Gansu. The government has also specially provided aircraft for them to use in case of cloudy or rainy weather. The Southeast team is in Wuyi Mountain in Fujian Province. Although it is of an auxiliary nature, it also has more than 60 experts. In addition, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and other provinces have also formed independent observation teams. The Northwest team plans to broadcast the measurement and observation situation to the International Broadcasting Station from 9:30 AM to 12:20 PM this morning. The grand occasion is unprecedented. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)

Radio Broadcasts Observation Situation

When scientists in China are using their latest instruments to observe the solar eclipse, the common people of Chongqing are still following the traditions passed down, beating gongs, firing cannons, and shouting loudly to scare away the "heavenly dog." At 11 AM today, the solar eclipse covered 90 percent of the sun. The clouds floating in the sky allowed people to easily observe the solar eclipse with the naked eye. When the sun was only visible as a crescent, the sky was dark and the temperature also dropped. Chongqing Radio also broadcasted the scientists' report on the solar eclipse. This report was transmitted from Lintao to Lanzhou via long-distance telephone, and from Lanzhou, it was broadcasted via radio. It was received and retransmitted by Chongqing's XGOY, broadcasting it domestically and internationally. The broadcast said that no fewer than 10,000 people gathered in Lintao to observe the solar eclipse, including thousands of scientists, officials, and Russians. Scientists also boarded airplanes to film moving pictures. During the total solar eclipse, the temperature dropped by four degrees, and observers had to write records by the light of lamps. The various stages of the solar eclipse differed from the predicted time by only one second. The sky was extremely clear, which made it easy to observe. (United Press dispatch from the 21st)

Lanzhou – Lintao County in southern Gansu Province is currently gathering many experts in astronomy, physics, meteorology, and other fields from all over the country, preparing to observe the total solar eclipse passing through the area at 10:51 AM on the 21st. The path of totality of this total solar eclipse starts in Soviet Central Asia and enters China at 10:15 AM on the 21st, south of Yidan in Xinjiang Province. It passes through the four provinces of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, and Shaanxi, leaving Shaanxi at 11:58 AM, passing through Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian, and entering the sea. From northwest to southeast, it covers over 4,200 kilometers. Such a celestial phenomenon, seen in the same area, can be traced back to 550 BC (the 23rd year of Duke Xiang of Lu), making its rarity evident. On this 4,000-plus kilometer path of totality, most experts believe that Lintao is the most ideal location for observation. Therefore, although China's solar eclipse observation team has two teams, Southeast and Northwest, it is still the latter that is the main force. Experts from the Astronomy Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, from Director Zhang Yuzhe to Li Heng, Chen Zungui, Li Guoding, Gong Shumo, and other experts, have all come here. The Department of Education and the Radio Education Training Program of Jinling University have jointly sent three personnel to take films of the solar eclipse. Gao Lu, president of the Chinese Astronomical Society, at the age of 65, has also come to Lanzhou to preside over everything. It has been raining here for days, and people are deeply worried that this celestial phenomenon, seen once every 2,500 years, will be missed due to rainy weather on that day. However, today's science can make up for this possible shortcoming. The relevant authorities have allocated an aircraft specifically for the experts to ascend into the sky for observation. In addition, the Central Broadcasting Station has sent a special correspondent to report on the observation situation on the same day, starting from 9 AM-12 PM (Central Time), and will report on the spot in that area. It is directly connected by the Lanzhou Broadcasting Station and retransmitted by the Chongqing Central and International Broadcasting Stations. Therefore, domestic and international people who are not in the area of totality can also hear the details of the Lintao solar eclipse. (Dispatch from the 19th)

Xi'an – The area through which the total solar eclipse on the 21st of this month passes in Shaanxi Province includes 13 counties such as Baoji, Fengxian, and Ankang. The Department of Education has specially invited more than 40 representatives from relevant agencies to form an observation team, with Xiong Bin as the honorary team leader and Wang Jiesan and Li Chai as the captain and vice-captain. At 7 PM on the 19th, a special train went to the Baoji and Fengxian area for observation. Observation points are set up in Baoji and Fengxian, under Huang Niusi (on Ziling Mountain). Instruments and radio stations have also been installed in both places. (Dispatch from the 20th)

Soviet Observation Team Departs Separately

Alma-Ata, (Tass) – Scientist Alma Senkov told a Tass reporter that all steps for observing the solar eclipse of September 21 had been prepared. Fisher said, "Even during the time of war, the Soviet government has continued to express interest in science, sending scientific expeditions to each zone of the solar eclipse, in order to carry out large-scale observations. We wish to express our gratitude. All expeditions have already arrived at their observation sites. Expeditions led by Pulkovo, including members from the Kazakh Astronomical Organization, Moscow's Planetary Research Institute, and Leningrad's largest observatory, have been stationed in the Alma-Ata area. A joint expedition formed by Leningrad's Astronomical Organization, the Abastuman Observatory, and the Georgian Academy of Sciences, among others, has gathered 250 kilometers east of Alma-Ata. An expedition from the Tashkent Observatory will conduct observations in Kzyl-Orda. A Leningrad expedition group, bearing a special mission, has been stationed near Nikolayevka, on the northern border of the path of the eclipse. All the apparatus used by the expedition groups is very advanced, a part of it being new Soviet apparatus. Of primary importance in the observation of the process of this eclipse is to confirm the mass composition of the solar atmosphere; in particular, solar physicists should pay attention to the hydrogen gas content. One aspect of the observational work will be to verify the principles of relativity. The apparatus employed in this work has been installed on the Caucasus Plateau (near Alma-Ata). It was made in Moscow, and the experimental statistics will be accurate." (Tass, 20th)

### Chongqing Daily Necessities Re-determine Reasonable Prices; Chairman Chiang Orders Relevant Authorities to Handle It; Strictly Prohibit Merchants from Raising Prices Without Authorization

Chongqing – In the past two to three months, the prices of daily necessities in Chongqing, except for food, have continued to increase. The same is true for labor costs. Chairman Chiang recently issued a special order to the responsible authorities to re-determine reasonable prices for various daily necessities and strictly prohibit merchants from raising prices without authorization. According to the price changes this time, it is indeed due to merchants increasing their profit margins, and their excuse is transportation costs and labor costs. The official price regulations are ineffective. There are few items available at the fixed-price supply points, and the quantity is far less than needed, so they cannot achieve the effect of stabilizing prices. Now the director of the office, Wu Wentian, has been ordered by the ministry to fly to Kunming yesterday to inspect transportation issues and attend a certain transportation meeting.

Editorial

### The Three-Month Milestone of the Soviet-German War

Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, launched on June 22nd, has reached its three-month mark today. That a modern war, involving millions of troops and stretching over thousands of English miles, has been deadlocked for such a long time is a new record in history, and also the first time Hitler has truly met his match. In these ninety days of battle, the total manpower mobilized by both sides amounts to over ten million, and the numbers of tanks and artillery are also in the tens of thousands. It is not difficult to imagine the fierce nature of the fighting and the enormous consumption of manpower and material. Although the Soviet Union has suffered more in terms of territory, Nazi Germany has encountered a significant setback in terms of time. Even if the German side had a large stockpile of war materials before the war, after two years of combat and blockade, coupled with the near-desperate consumption of the past three months, the extent to which its subsequent war machine can maintain its original effectiveness is a very serious question. According to experts from various countries, it is believed that Germany's gasoline reserves are only sufficient for a very short period of combat, which is one of the main reasons why Germany urgently launched the offensive against the Soviet Union. At this moment, both sides in the Soviet-German war feel that their life and death are at stake, but the degree of urgency is clearly greater for the German side. If the Nazis cannot achieve a decisive victory in the near future, this winter will be an unprecedented challenge for Hitler. Many of his past achievements and victories will, like the fate of all aggressors in history, come to a disillusioned end. From this perspective, it is very natural that the German forces have recently launched tentative offensives on all fronts, reaching a very intense level.

In the course of the past three months of war, the recent German offensive can be regarded as the third since the start of the war. Compared with the initial all-out invasion and the central breakthrough in mid-August, this offensive is the most fierce and longest, and it does not adhere to a fixed combat objective, but instead attempts to find weaknesses across the entire front. From Murmansk in the far north to the important ports on the northern coast of the Black Sea in the south, almost no stronghold has not been attacked fiercely by the German army. Therefore, the German side has gained some advantages in offensive strategy, which is how they achieved some progress in the north and south. The Soviet army's defense on the central front has been the most effective. For more than two months, they have been holding out in the Smolensk area. Their recent successful counterattacks have not only further increased the stability of the capital, Moscow, but also had some positive effects on the overall war situation. Therefore, the Nazi side seems to have recently placed less emphasis on the central front and is carrying out large-scale assaults on the north and south with all its strength. Ten days ago, Leningrad was once on the verge of danger, but although the threat of encirclement has not diminished recently, it has already turned from danger to safety. If the German army can capture the city, it would naturally be a major gain in terms of prestige, but it is not very important in terms of strategic and economic significance. Moreover, some Soviet strongholds and naval forces on the Baltic Sea are still a strong outer perimeter of Leningrad, and the German army has not been able to eliminate them. Furthermore, winter is approaching, and continuing to fight in the area of 60 degrees north latitude is not something that the Nazi troops can fully handle. The inherent fortress characteristics of Leningrad itself mean that the German army will have to pay a very high price. Therefore, the real center of gravity of the Soviet-German war is still in Ukraine in the south. Economically, this is the main goal of the German side; strategically, the German army may gain some new advantages; politically, it is the only way to threaten the Near East and the Caucasus and cut off the British-Soviet connection; climatically, it is a relatively easy area for the German army to continue fighting in the winter. Moreover, in the past three months, the Nazis have only made significant progress in this area. It is expected that the war on the Ukrainian front will inevitably be the focus of the overall situation in the future, and it is also the target of a life-and-death struggle between the two sides.

According to German news from the day before yesterday, the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, has unfortunately fallen. In addition to crossing the Dnieper River at several points, the German army intends to cut off the connection between the Crimean Peninsula and the Soviet mainland through the Perekop Isthmus, in order to use the peninsula as a base for advancing eastward and coveting the Caucasus. The claim that Kiev has fallen has not yet been officially confirmed by the Soviet side, but it is undeniable that it is in extreme danger. In early August, the city was once on the verge of danger, but it was fortunately rescued later. However, the Soviet army failed to take the opportunity to consolidate its position, and instead the German army broke through the defense line at several points and carried out a flanking maneuver. It is already a remarkable miracle that the two cities of Kiev and Odessa have been able to hold out in an isolated state of encirclement for more than a month. At this moment, it seems that their gains and losses do not have a very significant impact on the overall war itself, and even if the German army can make some progress, it is still a long way from a real victory. However, if Kiev really falls, the German side will have achieved one of its goals of capturing the three major cities. At this time, when the war has just reached its three-month mark, it will be a source of comfort for the Nazis both internally and externally, and it will inevitably cause some fluctuations in the overall situation in the Near East and even the attitudes of the Turkish and Bulgarian countries, thereby affecting the future of the Black Sea, the Crimean Peninsula, and even the Caucasus. Judging from past war records, the Soviet army is best at fighting battles with its back to the city. Even if it loses some strongholds, it will not harm the integrity of its resistance strength. However, the overall war situation in the Ukrainian region is now in considerable chaos. To effectively curb the continued advance of the Nazis, it is necessary to make a comprehensive and effective adjustment to the defensive positions in the region.

Recently, British and American aid to the Soviet Union has been actively underway. The Three-Power Conference to be held in the Soviet capital will presumably be able to reach valuable resolutions on how to enable the Soviet Union to more effectively prevent the Nazi invasion, which will be more than enough to compensate for the loss of manpower and material resources in the Ukrainian region. On the other hand, British public opinion has also recently criticized the government for its ineffective aid to the Soviet Union and its failure to launch a strong counter-offensive against Germany to contain it. Perhaps the British authorities are still concerned about the enormous strength of the Nazis, so the counter-offensive is still pending. However, judging from the spirit and strength shown by the British army in the past battles of Dunkirk, Greece, and Crete, it is not absolutely impossible to launch a counter-offensive. Moreover, the three-month war has left the Nazis in considerable exhaustion, and at present, when the Nazis are planning to continue their eastward invasion from Ukraine, it is precisely the time when the British army urgently needs to step up its counter-offensive, whether for the sake of aiding the Soviet Union or for self-defense.

### Sangkgran's Radio Address: The Situation in Thailand is Extremely Tense; War Could Break Out at Any Time; Warns the Public to Protect National Security

Reuters, Bangkok, 21st: Thai Prime Minister Sangkgran broadcasted from Bangkok last night, saying that the situation is tense and the war involving Thailand could break out at any time. In this environment, the people of the country have the responsibility to strictly obey the government's policies and orders. Thailand must not take sides. If the people of the country do not listen and war breaks out, the responsibility will be borne by the people, and he and the government cannot guarantee the security of the country. He appealed to the people of the country to do their best to maintain neutrality in words and deeds within the possible range, before new developments occur.

United Press, Bangkok, 21st: The Thai Prime Minister broadcasted last night, warning the public that Thailand is currently shrouded in a serious and tense atmosphere. The Prime Minister said that Thailand is not currently threatened by any country, so the people must maintain friendly relations with all countries.

Therefore, the Thai Consul General issued a broadcast in response.

The French Ambassador Once Asked the United States to Urge Japanese Troops to Withdraw from Vietnam

United Press, Washington, 21st: Authoritative circles said last night that French Ambassador Henri-Haye has requested the United States to discuss the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Vietnam with Japan. It was also said that Henri-Haye asked the United States to do its best to facilitate this matter in the recent US-Japan negotiations. This request was made by Henri-Haye when he met with Secretary of State Hull on Tuesday. Hull said that he had told the French Ambassador that the Vietnam issue could not be raised with the Japanese issue, because these negotiations were not for the purpose of negotiation.

Reuters, Washington, 21st: When Secretary of State Hull received newspaper reporters yesterday, a reporter asked whether the rumor that French Ambassador to the United States Henri-Haye had asked the United States to take action on the Japanese in Vietnam and urge them to leave during his conversation with the Secretary of State was true. Hull replied that he had allowed the French Ambassador to talk freely when he visited. A reporter interjected, "Then it seems that the French Ambassador did not have this conversation?" The Secretary of State replied, "The French Ambassador may discuss this matter with Xinhua reporters. I am willing to let him discuss the events he is concerned about." The reporter finally asked, "If the same question about US-Japan relations is asked, can the Secretary of State also give the same answer?" Hull replied, "I have to."

### Threatening Across the Sea, War is Approaching America; Walker and O'Leary Issue Warnings; Revision of the Neutrality Act is About to be Realized

United Press, New York, 21st: Two major American officials, one being Postmaster General Walker and the other being former Postmaster General O'Leary, warned yesterday that war is approaching America. Walker said in a speech to a French group, "War is approaching us. We can know this from the needs of national defense. We have not moved forward to meet the war, but the war has come across the land and sea at a whirlwind speed, challenging our freedom, threatening our country, and will affect the lives of our people. This is not an act of intervention, nor an act of isolation, nor a freely chosen action. This is an environment that forces us to come out and resist terrorist actions. Our self-defense measures are unavoidable." O'Leary said in Syracuse, "We have been threatened and must unite to deal with it. If we have learned lessons from the past two years, we must know that empty talk will not help. We must unite with all our strength, and any failure to do our best will endanger our freedom and life."

United Press, Washington, 21st: Democratic Senator George of Georgia yesterday asked the government to put the establishment of the country's diplomatic policy before the people for a final decision. The senator is the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee and a former chairman of the Senate International Relations Committee. He believes that the participation in the war is undoubtedly the final decision that the United States will make. He said that the promulgation of laws such as the abolition or amendment of the Neutrality Act can only disturb the public. George's remarks and those of Senator Connally, a Democratic senator from Texas and a spokesman for the Senate, who is paying attention to the move to abolish or amend the Neutrality Act, are speculated to mean that American merchant ships will trade with Britain, Ireland and other previously prohibited areas in the coming weeks.

United Press, Washington, 21st: Democratic Congressman Connally of Texas, chairman of the House of Representatives, predicted yesterday that the revision of the Neutrality Act will be realized within a few months. Connally refused to elaborate on his words. Other government officials have previously stated that they intend to review the Senate's response to the plan to change the bill this week, which is enough to indicate that the amendment is expected to be passed by a majority of two to one.

### The US President Approves an Unprecedented Tax Bill

Reuters, Hyde Park, 1st: President Roosevelt yesterday signed a tax bill of 3,553,400,000 yuan, which is the largest tax bill in the United States ever, aimed at helping to meet the expenses of national defense and the lease program.

### Duff Cooper Returns to Singapore, Meets with Ambassador Cole

Reuters, Singapore, 21st: Duff Cooper, the British Minister of State Resident in the Far East, returned here this morning from the Dutch East Indies. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, also arrived here this afternoon. After discussing with Cooper, the British Ambassador will take a route to Hong Kong to return to Chongqing.

### Burma Builds Many New Airstrips, Accelerating the Transportation of Goods to China; Indian Troops Continue to Arrive in Rangoon to Increase Defense

Reuters, Rangoon, 21st: The facilities of Burma's new airfield have greatly improved in recent months, so it is expected that the goods that are continuously transported into China under the Lend-Lease Act will be transported more quickly. According to the results of this week's aerial reconnaissance, many new airfields have been built to expand the business of civil aviation in Burma. However, each airfield occupies a position in Burma's effective defense. In addition, about ten Indian soldiers continued to arrive yesterday and were stationed in designated locations.

Reuters, Rangoon, 21st: The Burmese government has decided to control cotton production in order to prevent the price of cotton from falling sharply. The government believes that the most effective way to prevent the price of cotton from collapsing is for the government to buy up all cotton production and sell some at the most appropriate market price, while the rest will be held for a good price. The details of this measure are currently under consideration.

### The Situation in Kyiv is Developing; the War Enters a Critical Stage; German Forces Reach the Sea of Azov, Attempting to Cut Off Crimea

Moscow, TASS, 21st - The Soviet Information Bureau announced in its evening report of the 20th that our forces fought fiercely against the enemy along the entire front during the day. The fighting around Kyiv was particularly intense. Our air force engaged in operations against enemy mechanized units, infantry, and artillery, and bombed enemy airfields and pontoon bridges. On the 18th, sixteen German aircraft were shot down in aerial combat, while we lost fourteen. Our warships sank a large German freighter in the Barents Sea.

Moscow, Reuters, 21st - Although the Germans claim to have captured Kyiv, recent Soviet communiqués state that particularly fierce fighting is taking place there. It is also stated that Soviet warships sank a large German transport ship in the Barents Sea yesterday, and that the Soviet air force bombed German mechanized units, infantry, and artillery, as well as enemy aircraft scattered at airfields, and destroyed German pontoon bridges.

Moscow, Associated Press, 21st - The Soviet Information Bureau reported last night that there was fierce fighting between German and Soviet forces in Kyiv, but did not deny or confirm that German forces had occupied the city. The report stated that there was aerial combat near Leningrad, and that the Soviet air force had successfully attacked in other areas of the front. Recent frontline news indicates that Soviet forces have retaken fourteen villages in the central region. The report stated, "Our air force attacked enemy armored units, infantry, artillery, airfields, and pontoon bridges."

London, Reuters, 21st - Although the Germans claim to have captured Kyiv two days ago, recent news from Moscow indicates that fierce fighting continues at all the city's entrances. German communiqués also report that German vanguard units have reached the Sea of Azov north of the Black Sea, isolating the Soviet forces in Crimea. According to news received here, Soviet forces are currently maintaining fierce resistance around Leningrad, halting the German advance. The situation around Odessa in the central region has slightly eased due to the increasing severity of Soviet offensives. London newspapers are expressing a desire to see more advanced aid to the Soviet Union. It is reported that the Soviet Union, due to the German advance in Ukraine, frankly fears that Japan may invade Siberia and the Maritime Provinces.

London, Reuters, 21st - Rome Radio reports that General Voroshilov's son has been captured by German forces on the Eastern Front.

German Headquarters, Haitong News Agency, 21st - The German military report this afternoon stated that German forces on the southern flank of the Eastern European theater have reached the Sea of Azov. Soviet forces trapped southeast and due east of Kyiv are being annihilated. German forces invading Kyiv from the west have crossed the Dnieper River and met with German forces coming south from the north across the Desna River. Enemy forces have repeatedly attempted to break out of the encirclement, but have failed. The number of prisoners and captured military supplies is increasing daily on the German side. The German fleet has penetrated deep into the Gulf of Finland, assisting German forces in attacking Soviet islands in the Baltic Sea. German aircraft sank a Soviet patrol boat and one or two merchant ships (10,000 tons) northwest of Crimea. A Soviet torpedo boat was hit by bombs.

Stockholm, Reuters, 21st - According to a Berlin dispatch in the Svenska Dagbladet, the entire city of Kyiv has not yet been occupied by German forces, and street fighting continues. Attention should now be paid to the possibility of German forces linking up from Bryansk and Poltava to encircle Moscow. Another German route may extend northeast from Velikiye Luki. The Finns themselves claim that Petrokrepost is under their artillery fire, but Soviet resistance is strong, and Finnish forces may not be able to capture it soon. The Finns also say that Finnish forces have reached the Murmansk Railway.

Berlin, Haitong News Agency, 21st - It was revealed here last night that a German unit advanced rapidly eastward towards Kyiv yesterday, continuing to occupy a small town. In this operation, thousands of enemy soldiers were captured, and ten train cars and a large amount of war equipment were lost. In another point within the same area, German forces also captured thousands of enemy soldiers, nine aircraft, and countless military supplies. German artillery also shot down an enemy aircraft.

Haitong News Agency, 21st - Official documents here declare that 150,000 enemy soldiers have been captured east of Kyiv.

Important Bridge on the West Bank of the Dnieper River Destroyed

Moscow, Reuters, 21st - Soviet engineers have destroyed an important bridge connecting Khortytsia Island in the Dnieper River to the west bank of the Dnieper. Khortytsia Island is seven miles long and one mile wide, and faces Zaporozhye a few miles below the Dnieper Dam. If German forces were to obtain this island, they could send troops across the river to seize Zaporozhye. Therefore, Soviet engineers braved the danger of enemy artillery and machine-gun fire raining down like bullets, bravely advancing under cover of darkness for two days, finally reaching the bridge and destroying it. The time required to place the explosives and destroy the bridge was only twenty minutes. While they were placing the explosives and destroying the bridge, Soviet artillery bombarded the German positions at the end of the bridge to provide cover for the engineers. Khortytsia Island was the site where the famous 17th-century Ukrainian military leader Bohdan Khmelnytsky established his headquarters.

Berlin, Reuters, 21st - The German official news agency commented on yesterday's communiqué from the Supreme Command, stating that German forces, advancing simultaneously from the south and north, finally captured Kyiv despite resistance from artillery fire on the west bank of the Dnieper River. Several divisions of German infantry advanced bravely, breaking through Soviet resistance. The fall of Kyiv now represents the collapse of the entire northern Ukrainian Soviet defense line. The completion of the large encirclement east of Kyiv and the intensification of the encirclement of enemy forces east of the Dnieper River have placed all of northern Ukraine under German control. Therefore, only eastern Ukraine remains under Soviet control. German forces are now advancing deeply north from the Kremenchug bridgehead, indicating that eastern Ukraine is also in danger. The capture of Worms Island and Moon Island in the Gulf of Riga is a prelude to the Soviet loss of a foothold in the Baltic Sea. The news agency also stated that the Soviet forces trapped in Kyiv are now struggling to break out. On Friday night, German forces concentrated artillery fire, destroying many types of Soviet trucks, preventing the Soviet forces from breaking out. A German military spokesman stated yesterday that on Friday, when German forces attacked the encircled Soviet forces east of Kyiv, they captured thousands of enemy soldiers, seized ten train cars, and many other items. Last night, the German news agency admitted that fierce fighting continued within Kyiv on Friday. German forces had engaged in fierce fighting for two days before entering Kyiv. On September 13th, German forces gathered 130 miles east of the Dnieper River, and by the 17th, they launched a lightning-style war to capture Kyiv. On the 19th, they seized artillery forts, arsenals, and many barracks, and then successively occupied various districts of the city. Soviet military authorities had made preparations for street fighting, placing grenade launchers, tank traps, barbed wire entanglements, machine-gun nests, and defensive shelters in evacuated residential areas to enable the defending forces to fight to the end. However, this plan failed due to the sudden and unexpected attacks by German forces.

Red Army on the Central Front Recaptures Many Villages

Moscow, Associated Press, 21st - News from the front at one o'clock yesterday stated that Soviet forces had recaptured many villages on the central front. At that time, the Red Army and Nazi forces continued to fight around Kyiv. The news stated that General Sharov's four army corps, under the command of Marshal Timoshenko, recaptured fourteen villages and advanced thirteen miles in the central front area. It also stated that in this operation, the 40th and 63rd German Regiments were defeated, as well as the Ritov Corps and the 39th Zuk Corps. The advance is still continuing. The reporter for Red Star in Kyiv is still sending dispatches from that location. According to the reporter, who was reached here at noon on Saturday, "German forces are attacking the city like vicious beasts." The fighting on the southern border and northern suburbs of Kyiv is particularly intense. According to a radio report from Kyiv on Friday night, the fighting outside the city is fierce, with Soviet troops fighting fiercely for every inch of territory, inflicting heavy losses on the German forces. According to a reporter from Pravda in Kyiv, "Fifteen German divisions, exceeding the number of Soviet defenders, are concentrating armored vehicles and aircraft in an attempt to capture the city. On one occasion, they broke through the city's defenses, placing the city in extreme danger." It is also stated that authoritative sources here estimate that the German forces lost as many as ten tank divisions in the 45-day attack on Kyiv and are now sending ten new divisions to reinforce. This is why Soviet forces are able to continue to prevent the German advance.

Berlin, Reuters, 21st - A German High Command spokesman broadcast from Berlin last night that offensive and counter-offensive actions on the central front are incessant, as Soviet forces attempt to break out to the west, but all have failed, resulting in heavy losses.

Moscow, Reuters, 21st - A column of the German Rommel mechanized army, with seventy tanks and concentrated infantry, moving towards Odessa, was fiercely bombed and strafed at low altitude by the Soviet Black Sea Fleet's air wing. Soviet bombers have destroyed over sixty German tanks and automobiles and killed 300 enemy soldiers in the past two days, and shot down two enemy fighter planes.

Tank Battles on the Northern Front; Soviet Aircraft Bomb German Forces

Moscow, TASS, 21st - Tank battles erupted again on the northern front yesterday. The Seroko tank unit destroyed eighteen German tanks. The Imakov tank unit annihilated two companies of Finnish White Guards. At another location, seven enemy anti-tank guns and a large number of troops were destroyed by our fierce artillery fire.

Moscow, TASS, 21st - On the northern front, the Red Army led by Rudakov crushed an elite regiment of the Finnish White Guard's 7th Regiment, inflicting 100 casualties on enemy officers and soldiers. We also captured five anti-tank guns and six machine guns. The Red Army led by Gantutuvit also achieved remarkable results, killing countless enemies and capturing sixteen cannons and many other war equipment.

London, Reuters, 21st - Moscow Radio announced last night that aircraft of the Soviet Baltic Fleet attacked German forces invading Leningrad with considerable success, destroying twelve enemy heavy tanks, nine trucks and anti-aircraft gun vehicles. A German radio broadcast last night stated that the Soviet counter-offensive on the Leningrad front had collapsed.

### Finnish Envoy Publishes "Blue-White Book"; Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Sharply Refutes

Kuibyshev, TASS, 21st - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Deputy Director of the Information Bureau, Lozovsky, responded to foreign reporters on the 19th to refute various rumors regarding the "Blue-White Book" fabricated by Finnish Ambassador to the United States, Procope. He stated, "Finland, in order to break the current stalemate, is making every effort to win American sympathy. Therefore, the Finnish authorities, in collusion with Germany, fabricated the so-called 'Blue-White Book' and translated it into English for publication in the United States. (1) The Blue-White Book falsely claims that after the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty in 1940, the Soviet Union attempted to destroy Finland's independence. In reality, if the Soviet Union had the intention of destroying Finland's independence, it would have had sufficient power to do so. As the world knows, Finland sued for peace because it could no longer continue fighting. At that time, if the Red Army had continued its offensive for a few days, the Finnish army would have completely collapsed. However, the Soviet Union did not take this step, but instead stopped the offensive, made peace with Finland, and never interfered in Finnish internal affairs. This fact has proven that the Soviet Union had absolutely no intention of destroying Finland's independence. (2) Procope falsely claims that when the Soviet-German war broke out, the Red Army attacked Finland first. However, Procope obviously did not inform American leaders of the following facts: A, Before the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Finnish government had long agreed to turn Finland into a base for attacking the Soviet Union and allowed German troops to enter Finland. B, At the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, no fewer than 80,000 German troops were concentrated in Finland. C, Two days before the German attack on the Soviet Union, German troops took over positions on the Soviet-Finnish border. D, Before the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, mobilization had already begun in Finland. E, On June 21st, aircraft from Finland attacked Kronstadt. Such incidents continued to occur on the 23rd and 24th. F, Hitler admitted in his official statement, 'German soldiers under the command of the conqueror of Norway, together with Finnish heroes, are defending Finnish territory.' All of these are undeniable facts. (3) Procope falsely claims that the Soviet Union attempted to force Finland to conclude a secret treaty allowing the Red Army to pass through Finland, and claimed that Finland therefore allowed German troops to pass through. This kind of false statement is truly foolish. Since the Soviet Union did not want to attack other countries at that time, why would it need to pass through Finland? (4) Procope claims that the Soviet Union assisted revolutionary groups operating in Finland. Procope's statement clearly shows that he is spreading rumors without any sense of shame. Since the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, Finland has established a Soviet-Finnish Friendship Association, whose members advocated maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union and absolutely not colluding with Germany to attack the Soviet Union, thus inviting destruction. All those who made such claims have been persecuted. The Soviet Union has had to express its regret over this. Now, Procope is making such absurd and false statements, intending to confuse American people. At this point, Lozovsky mentioned the confessions of Finnish prisoners of war, proving the true feelings of the Finnish people and army who are unwilling to fight against the Soviet Union and who hate German fascism. The Soviet Union has repeatedly declared the need to ensure the security of the Soviet-Finnish border, which Britain and the United States have now had to acknowledge. I firmly believe that Procope's false statements will not be trusted. Every honest person can now recognize the following undeniable facts: (1) There is currently no independent Finland. (2) The Finnish government completely obeys Hitler and his followers. (3) German troops are in fact the masters of Finland. In order to please their master, the Finnish rulers are willing to sacrifice the Finnish people, who are destroying Finland's independence and the Finnish people? It is now extremely clear that Hitler and his followers are the culprits in destroying Finland's independence."

### Secretary of State Hull Declares: US Plans to Accelerate Aid to the Soviet Union; Long-Range Bombers Will Fly Directly; No New Findings on Soviet-Japanese Issues

Washington, Reuters, 21st - Secretary of State Hull, in a meeting with journalists yesterday, answered a question about whether the US government intended to increase aid to the Soviet Union in light of news from London, stating that the US government planned only to increase and accelerate aid to the Soviet Union. Asked whether information received by the State Department indicated that the situation in the Soviet Union was serious, as news from London suggested, Hull replied that he had not received detailed and accurate reports from all sides, and therefore could not comment, so as not to mislead anyone. A journalist then mentioned news from Tokyo that a large number of personnel from the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo had suddenly left and returned to the Soviet Union, and asked if the Secretary of State had received reports that Japan was planning new aggression. Hull replied that he had no new news on Soviet-Japanese affairs in the Far East.

London, Associated Press, 21st - The leader of the US delegation to Moscow, Averell Harriman, revealed yesterday that members of the US delegation had reached an agreement on the immediate shipment of military aid supplies to the Soviet Union. He said that the shipment of supplies to the Soviet Union would only be limited by transportation problems. However, Harriman stated that a policy regarding long-term aid to the Soviet Union had not yet been agreed upon. The main question for the British and American delegations was to determine what kind of aid the Soviet Union would need next year if the war were to stall during the winter.

Washington, International News Service, 20th - It was learned from authoritative sources yesterday that the US will fly long-range bombers directly to the Soviet Union via Alaska in order to help block the rapidly advancing German forces. This move will be part of the US aid plan to the Soviet Union. It is understood that the British government is well aware that the Soviet Union currently needs aircraft more than Britain, and has therefore agreed to relinquish its rights to purchase a large number of bombers that are currently crossing the Atlantic to reach the UK. Other American aircraft will also soon fly from the UK to the Soviet Union. It is expected that during the winter, American aircraft can only fly to the Soviet Union via Alaska.

Tokyo, Reuters, 21st - According to Japanese news agencies, Foreign Minister Toyoda was received in audience by the Emperor yesterday afternoon to report on the international situation.

Tokyo, Reuters, 21st - The Japan Times, the mouthpiece of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, published an article yesterday warning the Soviet Union not to indiscriminately lay mines, which would hinder freedom of the seas. It said that the indiscriminate laying of mines and the establishment of dangerous sea areas endangered navigation, and that the Soviet Union itself would be affected, as shipping companies would not risk entering Soviet territorial waters. If a Japanese ship were to be sunk by a drifting mine laid by another country in nearby waters, it would inevitably cause disputes that everyone wanted to avoid. According to Japanese news agencies, a total of four Soviet-made mines were recovered earlier this month off the northeast coast of Korea, having been swept away from Vladivostok by storms and drifting to northeastern Korea.

### Bulgarian Prime Minister Announces State of Emergency; Orders Officials to Prepare; Declares Friendly Policy Towards the Axis

London, Reuters, 21st - According to a broadcast from Ankara last night, Bulgaria has declared a state of emergency. Prime Minister Filov issued a special statement announcing that strict measures would be taken against Bulgaria's enemies. Prime Minister Filov instructed officials to immediately report any incidents of disruption of discipline to the government. The Zora newspaper reported that the Prime Minister's action was of extreme importance and aimed at safeguarding Bulgaria's sovereignty. Other newspapers also called on the nation to prepare. Before the state of emergency was announced, Bulgarian police authorities announced the arrest of several Soviet paratroopers and infiltrators. Prime Minister Filov declared in his statement that Bulgaria would strictly adhere to its policy of friendship and support towards the Axis powers.

Sofia, Haitong News Agency, 21st - Bulgarian Prime Minister and Minister of Culture Professor Filov and Minister of the Interior Gabrovski published an article in the newspapers yesterday entitled "Defend the Motherland" as a call to action. Filov urged his subordinate officials to work hard to fight the enemy, as this is the most important task at present. Gabrovski discussed Bulgaria's current situation, saying that Bulgaria may be the only country in Europe today that is self-sufficient in food, and its people can enjoy the happiness of peace at home. There are no disagreements or disputes among the people, and the internal situation is very satisfactory. Bulgaria has various characteristics that will surely enable it to become an extremely strong country in terms of economy and culture. The Bulgarian people all regard the work of the Axis powers as their own work.

Sofia, Haitong News Agency, 21st - The protest lodged by Bulgaria with the Soviet government regarding the activities of Soviet paratroopers and saboteur spies entering Bulgarian territory has been unanimously welcomed by the Bulgarian press. It is believed that the secret activities of the Soviet Embassy in Bulgaria, inciting sabotage, have attracted the most attention. Relations between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union have recently become increasingly tense due to such incidents, and there is a possibility of severing diplomatic relations in the near future. However, Bulgarian officials say that Bulgaria will not take this action first, nor will it give the Soviet Union an excuse to sever relations.

Sofia, Associated Press, 21st - Dance halls, cafes, and other entertainment venues and bars were ordered to close at midnight yesterday.

Sofia, Haitong News Agency, 21st - Bulgarian Police Chief Dragalov yesterday released details to the press of the Soviet paratroopers' activities in landing in Bulgaria to carry out sabotage work. It is said that the Soviet Union began its conspiracy to disrupt security in Bulgaria in July of this year. At that time, Bulgarian cities were bombed, and the Communist Party simultaneously distributed propaganda pamphlets in Bulgaria. On August 11th, Soviet paratroopers, with the help of a submarine from the Black Sea port of Varna, landed in Bulgaria for the first time. They attacked a patrol train. The second landing was on August 28th, and the Bulgarian police immediately eliminated them. Most of the paratroopers committed suicide to avoid punishment. The third landing was on September 13th. These paratroopers, upon arrival in Bulgaria, immediately contacted the Soviet Embassy. They all received military training before going to Bulgaria and carried foreign currency, radios, time bombs, and over 1,000 kilograms of explosives.

### Two Bulgarian Freighters Sink After Hitting Mines

Sofia, Associated Press, 21st - Bulgarian maritime authorities announced today that two Bulgarian ships, the 4,158-ton Rodina and the freighter Shipka, sank last week in the Black Sea after hitting foreign-laid mines. The Rodina was traveling from Burgas to Istanbul, and four of its crew members are still missing. Experts have found three Soviet-laid mines near the explosion.

### British Air Force Launches "Daylight Offensive" on the Western Front; Hundreds of Aircraft Sortie; Germany, Norway, and France Bombed

Reuters, London, 21st – Yesterday, the British Air Force launched its largest "daylight offensive" on the Western Front since the beginning of the war, fiercely attacking enemy targets in Germany, Norway, and France, as well as convoys off the Dutch coast. The British side dispatched hundreds of fighters to escort bombers, encountering German fighter groups along the way. At least fifteen German aircraft were shot down, while the British lost three bombers and seven fighters. Last night, Radio Berlin stated, "There was fierce aerial combat over the English Channel, destroying thirty-eight British aircraft, while Germany lost two." According to an observer here, the exaggerated figures released by Germany are a sign that Germany has suffered a significant blow. Yesterday was definitely no exception. Although German radio broadcasts claimed that British attempts to cross the Channel coast were shattered, Emden, Germany, was once again subjected to a daylight raid, and the residents there were able to witness the power of American-made Flying Fortress bombers. At the same time, four locations in northern France and six enemy ships off the Dutch coast were bombed. Furthermore, fish oil factories on the northern coast of Norway, railways in Harstad and Alvdal, shipyards in Rouen, and docks in Cherbourg were also heavily attacked. The attacking British aircraft were heavily protected by fighters. The bombing results were quite successful. During the bombing of an enemy convoy off the Dutch coast yesterday, one ship was hit amidships, and another suffered damage to its stern. Four other ships also caught fire. Subsequently, British aircraft attacked another enemy convoy heading north near Hoek van Holland off the Dutch coast, singling out an oil tanker and dropping bombs from as low as twenty feet, scoring several hits. The enemy ship immediately fled into the harbor, and another medium-sized enemy ship burned fiercely after being hit. An enemy anti-aircraft vessel, firing intense light anti-aircraft artillery in an attempt to defend the convoy, was also hit in the stern and severely damaged.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st – The German Führer's headquarters announced last night that the British Air Force launched an air raid on the Channel coast yesterday afternoon. As a result, the British aircraft were severely damaged and fled, with thirty-five British fighters shot down by German fighters. Two German aircraft went missing. German naval artillery also shot down three British bombers. Therefore, the enemy aircraft suffered a total loss of thirty-eight, it was said.

British Aircraft Attack Ports in North Africa

Reuters, Cairo, 21st – A public announcement stated that the ports of Tripoli and Benghazi in North Africa were again subjected to British air raids on September 18th, with bombs hitting enemy ships and docks in the harbors. The enemy airfields of Gambut and the port of Bardia were also subjected to British daylight bombing. On September 18th, the British Naval Air Arm attacked two enemy merchant ships and five escort vessels in the central Mediterranean. Due to smoke screens, the results of the bombing could not be clearly seen, but one merchant ship was observed to have stopped after being hit. All the attacking British aircraft returned safely.

Reuters, Cairo, 21st – The British Middle East Command announced yesterday that on Thursday, Libya was hit by sandstorms, and Friday was relatively calm. When the wind subsided slightly, British troops in Tobruk observed a large enemy infantry unit outside the defense lines and opened fire, bombarding them heavily. British patrols in the border areas became active again.

### Italian Government Announces Ban on Jewelry Exports

United Press, Rome, 21st – The government announced today that tourists leaving Italy will not be allowed to take jewelry with them. They must declare the jewelry at the border and hand it over to Italian customs officials for safekeeping, to be retrieved upon their return to Italy. This new law supplements the recent order banning the sale of jewelry and the export of jewelry within Italy. Those entering Italy must also leave their jewelry at the border for retrieval upon departure. Violators of this law will have their jewelry confiscated and face imprisonment for two to ten years, as well as a fine of five thousand to fifty thousand Italian lire.

### Comparison of Stalin and Hitler

The red dictator Stalin and the brown dictator Hitler have now reached a point where they cannot coexist. This is a comparison made by the famous American journalist Walter Duranty (originally published in the New York Times), translated as follows:

The relationship between Hitler and Stalin is strange and unpredictable, worthy of contemplation. Their policies have always been diametrically opposed, like the North and South Poles. Later, they were able to shake hands and make peace, and people began to realize that although these two dictators have different personalities, there must be many similarities between Nazi and Bolshevik politics. Who knew that things would change so rapidly? Before long, the two went from friends to enemies. It is interesting to compare and analyze their lives!

Both Stalin and Hitler rose from humble origins to seize power in their respective countries, which is something they have in common. However, Stalin, although he ruled Soviet Russia, was Georgian, not Russian. Hitler, although he was the German leader, was Austrian, not German. Both rose to prominence through their own efforts. However, there is a fundamental difference between the two: Stalin's position was entirely inherited from Lenin, while Hitler's position was created by himself.

Hitler's dramatic rise was largely stolen from the Bolsheviks. In fact, Mussolini preceded Hitler in this regard, which is undeniable. He may have even learned from the mistakes of the Bolsheviks, using them as a warning to avoid repeating them. However, it seems to be a matter of fate that no matter how cunning they may be, there is one thing they cannot avoid, which is that both of them do not hesitate to kill their old comrades in order to consolidate their own positions.

Stalin's history is well known. He was the son of a poor shoemaker in Georgia. On the one hand, he relied on his own efforts, and on the other hand, he was able to attend a Orthodox school thanks to the kindness of an old pastor known to his mother. Stalin's mother was extremely religious. Once, when she met with an American visitor, she said sadly, "I know that my son is the master of the Kremlin, but if he hadn't been naughty and forced out of school for rebelling against God, he might have become a bishop now."

Like Hitler, Stalin participated in struggles in his youth, but not in wars against foreign countries. He once planned to rob a large sum of money being transported from the Tiflis National Bank to the train station. He may have participated in the bloody battle that followed the robbery. Many people have denied that Stalin was directly involved in this matter, but his courage in many strikes and labor unrests throughout the country cannot be denied.

Here is a very interesting point: Stalin and the "Western exiles" never reconciled after the split. The "Western exiles" were the group of people who fled to England, France, Switzerland, and other countries after the failure of the 1905-1906 revolution. At that time, Stalin remained in Russia and never surrendered. Since then, except for their leader Lenin, all of them regarded these exiles as fugitives and cowards.

Robbins once told me that Stalin was like a watchdog, watching everyone who came in every morning outside Lenin's door in Petrograd. I believe that Stalin was loyal to Lenin, looked up to him as a giant, and followed his lead. Trotsky's words are not to be believed. Hitler, on the other hand, was a loner, acting strangely and looking comical. This was not because he resembled Chaplin, but because of his humorous behavior!

I once saw him passing through the reception room of the Hotel Adlon in Berlin with Goering and the King of Siam. His face was not outstanding, and he was not at all moving. Churchill once called him a poor, nouveau riche rascal. But one thing was very noticeable: every German in the reception room at the time opened their eyes wide and stared at him intently, as if he were Siegfried, their hero. They did not feel that he was insignificant at all. This was easy to see when Hitler gave speeches. His passionate emotions and exaggerated rhetoric made foreigners feel cold all over, but made Germans feel excited and intoxicated.

Hitler once said that he was not a genius or Napoleon, and that the German nation was like a military band, and he was just the leading drummer. He would not say this today. He may be dreaming of becoming someone even greater than Napoleon. In the past, Alexander's martial prowess was unparalleled, and the territory he conquered extended to the Far East. When he died young, there was no more land in the world worth coveting. Now Hitler wants to follow in his footsteps. Hitler seems to have realized his ambitions and the wishes of the German people to the greatest extent. He seems to be no longer human, but close to a monster, becoming the embodiment of Germanism and a character in mythology. In short, he is like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, leading the German people blindly to destruction.

Stalin is nothing like this. If you read Pravda or other Bolshevik newspapers, you will find that the praise in them is only comprehensible to the minds of Orientals.

I have repeatedly heard in Moscow that Stalin does not like this kind of praise, but he does not interfere because he feels that he is a symbol, a central figure, just like the Tsar and the saints, who can unite the simple-minded Russians to support him. If this is true, then psychologically speaking, Russians seem to have a lingering attachment to old and useless things!

But we cannot forget that Stalin and Hitler's lives have one thing in common. Both of them suffered hardships in their early years. Stalin had no great ambitions at the time, and he was only content to stir up trouble in factories, incite strikes, and cause trouble for the police. He was often arrested, and after escaping, he continued to cause trouble. One day, he fell into the net and was sentenced to exile to the desolate and frigid land outside the Ural Mountains, and he could no longer escape.

He stayed there, hunting, fishing, and exercising his body and mind. He also read books, plotting with Georgian cunning, and communicating secretly with comrades around the world and friends in Russia. Hitler, on the other hand, was imprisoned and writing (to be continued)

### Ministry of Education Orders Provinces to Add Provincial Temporary Middle Schools or Increase Classes in Existing Middle Schools to Accommodate Students from War Zones

(Chongqing, 20th) The Ministry of Education ordered all provinces to add provincial temporary middle schools or increase classes in existing middle schools starting in the 30th academic year, to register students from war zones nearby and accommodate them. The necessary start-up costs, operating expenses, and student food expenses will be subsidized by the Ministry, in order to address the various difficulties that provinces have faced in the past due to the limited capacity of existing schools and classes and financial difficulties, which have prevented them from fully accommodating students from war zones who have lost their schooling.

### Under Leveling Management, Where Does the Black Market Go?

— The Vanguard

Fluctuations in the Black Market Exchange Rate Before and After (Part Two)

Hasty Implementation of Leveling Management

The strange phenomenon that arose in the foreign exchange market due to the freezing of assets, of course, could not be ignored by the Chinese government. Moreover, since the Leveling Fund owned a base of US$110 million, it had already planned concrete measures for managing the foreign exchange market and had considerable connections with the US asset freeze. Therefore, after consultations between Chinese and foreign committee members, on August 16th, the Shanghai official exchange rate was announced: three pence one eight seven five for British pounds, and five yuan three four three seven five for US dollars. After deducting the fair price fee of 0.03125 by HSBC, the official listed prices were three pence one five six two five and five yuan three one two five. Nine banks, including HSBC, Mercantile, Chartered, Citibank, Chase, Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, were designated to sell foreign exchange at the listed price for necessities. Since the new exchange rate was announced, the exchange rate was much higher than before, causing temporary chaos. The black market experienced another period of disturbance. Initially, no one inquired about black market rates, and the exchange rate rose to over five yuan. Later, because importers settled accounts with HSBC at the official rate, most, except for rice and coal, could not get what they wanted. Thus, they returned to the black market for settlement. The black market rate quickly rose again. It is puzzling that the Leveling Fund raised the exchange rate to settle foreign exchange for necessities, which should have been beneficial to the foreign exchange market. Why did foreign banks not fulfill their duties, causing instability in the foreign exchange market? What is the reason?

(1) The Leveling Fund only announced the supply of foreign exchange for necessities, but did not determine a list of necessities that could be settled with foreign exchange. The scope of necessities is very broad, and there were no standards for determining which could be settled with foreign exchange and which should be rejected, making it difficult for foreign banks to handle. Furthermore, foreign banks could not be reimbursed by the Leveling Fund for the foreign exchange they sold due to disputes over the nature of necessities, so foreign banks had to temporarily suspend or restrict supply.

(2) Lack of application procedures: Importers applying to foreign banks for foreign exchange should prepare what kind of procedures, which was not announced by the banks, no one knows the details. Therefore, importers could not get in the door and were willing to settle foreign exchange in the black market at a higher price.

(3) Foreign banks cannot forget the black market: After a period of silence, foreign banks rejoined the black market trading, and because the exchange rate listed at HSBC's small counter was the new exchange rate and could not be used as a basis, they switched to using the exchange rate listed at the small counters of Chase and Citibank as the standard for black market transactions.

Due to the above three reasons, the black market revived to its former prosperity. HSBC's listed rate gradually became a nominal official rate, and the Leveling Fund's management of the foreign exchange market clearly failed to take effect.

The Key to the Survival of the Black Market

When the United States froze Chinese and Japanese funds, the issue of the survival of the black market once attracted attention from all parties. Later, because the freeze was not thorough, the black market was not shaken in the slightest. This time, the Leveling Fund managed the Shanghai foreign exchange market, raising the exchange rate, and entrusted nine banks to supply foreign exchange for necessities. Undoubtedly, the Leveling Fund prepared to divert a portion of Shanghai's foreign exchange, reduce pressure on the black market, and make the initial step in eliminating the black market. However, the background of the Shanghai black market is the joint support of importers and exporters and foreign banks. If it cannot satisfy the desires of importers and exporters and cannot obtain the assistance of foreign banks, all efforts are futile. Because what importers need is foreign exchange. If they cannot obtain a sufficient supply from the legal market, they will inevitably resort to the black market. Foreign banks are for profit. Without special relationships, they will not easily withdraw from the black market. The two are the backbone of the black market and also the key to solving the foreign exchange market. Therefore, the Leveling Fund understands this point. When raising the official price did not work, it specially sent Mr. Taylor to Shanghai to study the Shanghai market environment for reference, and invited Mr. Hoskins of Mercantile Bank and Mr. Mackay of Citibank to Hong Kong on August 29 to participate in the Leveling Fund meeting held in Hong Kong, to discuss ways to supply foreign exchange to importers and promote cooperation with foreign banks. Indeed, before the meeting concluded, signs were already seen in Shanghai: Mercantile Bank and Chase Bank once stopped listing black market rates, although it was temporary in nature, it can also be known that the end of the black market is not far away.

Full Text of Trial Measures

The first announcement of the results of this Hong Kong Leveling Fund meeting was that the 14 foreign banks holding permits stopped listing US dollar rates on the black market on September 8 and withdrew from the black market. The black market, centered on foreign banks, suffered a blow, and all transactions had to come to a standstill. Following the cessation of the black market, the Leveling Fund promulgated the full text of the "Trial Measures for Banks Specifically Permitted to Operate Foreign Exchange in September" on September 9, translated as follows:

1. The Leveling Fund will formulate a List A and supply foreign exchange for the import of the largest commodities (including import freight and insurance fees) according to an allocation system. This foreign exchange will be provided to importers who have not settled foreign exchange.

2. The Leveling Fund will formulate a List B and supply foreign exchange for other major imports (including import freight and insurance fees).

3. A. For small imports not listed in Lists A or B and not prohibited from import, the Leveling Fund will supply foreign exchange in amounts not exceeding US$2,000 and £500 per item.

B. For personal remittances, travel expenses, insurance fees, etc., the Leveling Fund will provide foreign exchange at its discretion, not exceeding US$200 and £50 per person or family per month.

C. Each bank shall submit a weekly report to the Leveling Fund on the nature and amount of foreign exchange supplied for items in Lists A and B.

4. Foreign exchange shall not be supplied for commodities not listed in Lists A and B but prohibited from import unless approved by the Chinese government.

5. Foreign exchange may be supplied for bills of exchange due in September, but this does not apply to banks and importers holding special foreign currency security deposits. The supply of this foreign exchange shall be reported to the Leveling Fund.

6. Each bank may only settle foreign exchange at the statutory exchange rate and may not directly or indirectly operate in other exchange rates.

7. Banks shall buy and sell foreign exchange at the new exchange rate, whether buying foreign exchange or supplying foreign exchange for items in Lists A, B, and C. The buying and selling situation must be reported to the Leveling Fund weekly for verification.

8. Merchants who obtain foreign exchange from the Leveling Fund must sell the foreign exchange earned from exports to the 14 banks. If they sell it elsewhere, the Leveling Fund will cancel their application qualifications. The same applies to merchants who operate arbitrage.

9. The foreign exchange supplied by the Leveling Fund for import bills is all spot. Before supplying foreign exchange, the importing merchant must obtain an export tonnage quota and complete all export procedures. Otherwise, the Leveling Fund will recover all the foreign exchange sold at the exchange rate at the time of purchase.

10. The implementation of these measures relies on the proper handling of each bank. Each bank should understand that the foreign exchange supplied by the Leveling Fund for application is for bona fide and legal commercial purposes, and this type of foreign exchange cannot be obtained from other sources.

List of Goods Supplied and Application Forms

The Leveling Fund's list of goods supplied with foreign exchange is divided into two lists, A and B, listed as follows:

(1) List A: Rice, tobacco leaves, petroleum products (coal, above must be subject to considerable restrictions)

(2) List B: Cotton, jute, flax, ramie, hemp yarn and thread, mixed or unmixed cotton, linen cloth, wool and waste wool, iron and steel nails, screws and gaskets, tinplate, generators and electrical machinery for power generation and transmission, engines (i.e., gas engines), oil and steam engines, boilers, heaters, superheaters, coal loaders and other boiler room accessories and parts, unnamed machinery and parts, automobile parts and accessories (including machine pedals and vehicle tires),

Electrical materials for A, B, and C communication, transmission, and layout, equipment and accessories, A radios and parts, B canned corned beef, cheese, coffee, canned or bottled fruits, evaporated or sterilized milk and cheese, condensed milk, milk food (including dried milk), lactogen,

Carnation and unnamed food raw materials, flour, unnamed grain flours and grain products, wheat,

Molasses, A and B sugar,

A, B, and C chemical raw materials and compounds, pharmaceuticals,

Indigo dye, rice and other coal tar dyes, artificial indigo, tanning plant juice, dye shivers, colorants, tannins,

Paint, fake paint, polish, gum arabic, gums and resins, coconut oil, A and B oil, fats and waxes (essential oils, artificial fragrances), wrapping paper,

Packaging paper, sandpaper,

Including carbon copy paper, bible paper, carbon paper and stamp paper, A and B writing and printing paper, chemical and mechanical wood pulp, paper containers and other paper products, tanned leather (for soles and uppers),

Wood, A to F asbestos and its products, A raw rubber, D rubber tires for automobiles, various photographic and film materials and equipment (excluding chemicals), starch groceries (the above goods are in the 1934 Chinese government's list of goods permitted for import)

Regarding the method of applying for foreign exchange from the 14 banks, the importer fills out an application form called the "Application to the Leveling Fund for the Supply of Foreign Exchange." The content of the book is roughly as follows (translated from the English application form):

(1) Bank name

(2) Importer's name and address, Exporter's name and address

(3) Amount of foreign exchange applied for

(4) Foreign exchange payment situation (including the name and address of the recipient, or bill of exchange, telegraphic transfer, etc.)

(5) Import situation of goods (including customs declaration number, description of goods, value (US dollars or British pounds), country of manufacture, originating country, date of shipment, date of arrival

(6) Port of entry

(7) Transshipment location (if known in advance, please fill in)

(8) Sales situation (sales location), name and address of the buyer, name and address of the consignee)

(9) Remarks

(10) The bank's knowledge and belief guarantees that all items filled in above are true. If the Chinese Leveling Fund discovers that the import situation does not match the information on the application form, it agrees to sell the foreign exchange obtained from the Leveling Fund to the Leveling Fund at the purchase exchange rate. If the Leveling Fund needs various documents to prove it, it should provide them (both the applicant and the bank sign at the same time)

Four Major Features

Recently, the methods for foreign banks to supply foreign exchange and apply for it have been roughly described above. From the various measures formulated this time, it can be seen that the Leveling Fund has a deep understanding of the Shanghai market environment, so it can immediately solve the black market and promote the approval of foreign exchange. Among these features, it is necessary to elaborate.

First, foreign banks are restricted by the special permit to operate foreign exchange, and can only buy and sell at the new exchange rate, and cannot trade at other exchange rates. Foreign banks are isolated from the black market.

Second, the Leveling Fund's scope for settling foreign exchange for goods is wider than before. For example, tobacco leaves in List A and gasoline in petroleum products, ramie canned food in List B, etc., are included in the goods prohibited from import in 1939. Also, automobile wheels, tires, photography and video village materials, etc., in List B are not included in the goods permitted for import by the government, but the Leveling Fund all includes them in the goods for settlement of foreign exchange, which is completely based on the situation in this port and suitable for the needs of this port.

Third, the Leveling Fund implements a quota allocation system to give each type of goods a monthly foreign exchange settlement quota, with the intention of limiting the import quantity of goods, rather than restricting the types of goods, so as to supply daily needs, prevent large-scale hoarding, and the government can therefore avoid spending a large amount of funds to maintain the exchange rate for a long time.

Fourth, the foreign exchange management method stipulates that if importers and exporters do not sell the export bills of exchange to the specially permitted banks, the Leveling Fund will cancel their application qualifications. Importers and exporters will naturally follow this because of the import settlement relationship. Even merchants who export independently will find it difficult to find other places to go if they do not sell their counter bills to the specially permitted banks due to the elimination of the black market. From now on, the Leveling Fund can absorb export bills of exchange from sources to compensate.

Five Prospects

Therefore, although the various measures of this Leveling Fund are trial in nature, their initial success has been clearly revealed. What will happen in the future still depends on the efforts of the Leveling Fund and cannot be speculated, but what can be said is:

(1) The Leveling Fund is extremely cautious about using funds. The quota allocation system it adopts aims to protect funds and manage foreign exchange for a long time. Therefore, HSBC's listed US dollar exchange rate of 5.3125 yuan will not change for a while.

(2) The relationship between the black market and foreign banks has been mentioned before. Since foreign banks stopped listing black market exchange rates, the black market could not operate. Currently, foreign banks have cooperated with the Leveling Fund and have formulated special foreign exchange management measures to comply with. Foreign banks will hardly set foot in the black market again, and the black market has to take a historical rest because of this.

(3) Shanghai's foreign exchange income and expenditure are unbalanced. The Leveling Fund's supply of foreign exchange to Shanghai is to cover a portion of the deficit. However, because the amount is too large, it has to be restricted. If imports decrease and the trade situation improves in the future, the foreign exchange settlement quota may be relaxed. Conversely, if the Leveling Fund is unable to cope with the large deficit and reduces the quota, it is also possible. Therefore, the quota method should be flexible, and the future may often change.

(4) Although the goods in the two lists A and B announced by the Leveling Fund can be allocated foreign exchange according to the allocation system, the Leveling Fund will undoubtedly give priority to daily necessities in lists A and B in terms of the amount of each quota. Other goods are still secondary. According to news from foreign banking circles, the monthly foreign exchange quota for List A is US$1,000,000 for rice, US$1,000,000 for coal, US$900,000 for gasoline, and US$750,000 for tobacco. The monthly quota for List B will be determined according to the new method. Other goods not listed on the list will not exceed US$2,000 per type per day. Based on this, it is expected that in the future, many goods in the Shanghai market will not be able to be pushed out in large quantities due to the previous quota restrictions, which will directly affect import trade and indirectly affect all industries and businesses, especially small-scale industries and businesses will suffer the most.

(5) The foreign exchange business of Chinese banks has been unable to operate foreign exchange transactions since the United States froze funds because it has not received a note. All foreign exchange transactions that had not been completed before July 26 were completed by the Central Bank on August 15, and the internal handling and transfer were transferred to the Central Bank's account. Therefore, Chinese banks have stopped foreign exchange business for nearly two months. Recently, the Leveling Fund's management of the foreign exchange market has not taken Chinese banks into account. It is difficult to understand whether Chinese banks can continue to operate foreign exchange business in the future. However, judging from the current situation, the Shanghai foreign exchange market has been taken over by the Leveling Fund, and 14 foreign banks operate foreign exchange, but they are only acting as agents for buying and selling and collecting commissions. It is possible for Chinese banks to join the agency buying and selling. The current problem may be that Chinese banks are not banks holding permits, and the Leveling Fund has to consider this.

### The Needs of Stabilizing Price Trading Firms

— Shen Chengzhao

Since the outbreak of the war, the extremely complex exchange system of Shanghai society, which is constituted by the motivation of pursuing personal monetary interests, has been riddled with holes, all of which are exposed without reservation. Our government has painstakingly planned in detail to maintain the livelihood of the city's residents and the stability of finance, the stability of prices, and the maintenance of legitimate and legal trade. The announcement of this foreign exchange management method: the foreign exchange sold by the Leveling Fund is sufficient to purchase essential goods for import: foreign exchange speculation groups are cut off, and black market loopholes are blocked. The greatest function has been fulfilled. The foreign exchange sold by the Leveling Fund is used to purchase essential goods for import. The more foreign exchange sold, the more goods that must be imported. After the supply of goods has increased, there should be no reason for prices to rise. However, speculative trading firms in the city have made speculation a habit. The act of raising prices on the pretext or hoarding for profit can still affect prices, so stabilizing price trading firms should be established.

Establishment and Methods of Stabilizing Price Trading Firms

The establishment of stabilizing price trading firms can refer to the principle of the Leveling Fund. That is, when prices are raised by speculation, stabilizing price trading firms can sell goods at cost and reasonable profit. When prices are too low, they can come out and buy goods. They must keep prices at a certain level and not allow trading firms in the city to have phenomena of excessive profits and losses. However, the establishment of this type of trading firm has some secrecy. Those in charge should plan in detail. They should be established in the most discreet and small-scale manner to avoid unnecessary disturbance.

The Benefits of Stabilizing Price Trading Firms

1. The benefits of stabilizing price trading firms and the Leveling Fund. The Leveling Fund's greatest goals: (1) stabilizing exchange rates (2) easing prices. The association is still painstakingly making comprehensive considerations and decisions to achieve this goal. This time, it plans to adopt a method of guaranteeing foreign exchange application. All ten items are extremely detailed and thorough. It can already achieve the benefit of no false supply of foreign exchange. However, it is still difficult to predict whether the goods imported through foreign exchange settlement will be prohibited from being transshipped or hoarded for profit after being transported to Shanghai. Therefore, preventing speculative profiteering cannot be completely eliminated. During this period, stabilizing price trading firms can adopt it. Then the speculative scope can be reduced to the lowest limit. Because this type of trading firm will not speculate in essence. Moreover, the obstacles to the Leveling Fund's application approval can also be reduced. It is of great benefit to the Leveling Fund.

2. The benefits of stabilizing price trading firms and the city's industry and commerce. The biggest drawback of the monopoly system is that it seizes private enterprise and hinders the free development of the national economy. The so-called monopoly, strictly speaking, is exclusive or patented. It can make a few enterprises have the possibility of unemployment. Stabilizing price trading firms are not monopolies, so private enterprise can still exist and not compete with private enterprise for profit. However, planning a reasonable profit; leading prices under free competition. It does not allow the city's industry and commerce to have speculative profits or the ills of speculation. Therefore, it is also of great benefit to the city's industry and commerce. Moreover, it can indirectly increase the benefits of wartime revenue.

3. Stabilizing price trading firms and price limits. Although the city's speculative trading firms have promulgated various price limit laws, speculative trading firms often follow them superficially and violate them secretly, still disregarding laws and regulations. They either raise prices on the pretext or hoard for profit without shipping them out. The government has now announced the method of supplying legal foreign exchange and has agreed to supply foreign exchange for legitimate commerce. Originally, it was for the sake of people's livelihood and could stabilize the market. However, speculative trading firms in the city are using the excuse that the supplied foreign exchange is insufficient, and they are still using the old trick of raising prices and hoarding. It is really hateful. Now, once stabilizing price trading firms are established, they will be able to comply with price limits. And speculative trading firms will be difficult to use their tricks under free competition.

Concluding Remarks

In the past, due to speculation, hoarding, and other activities in the city, the social crisis has been deepening, and class antagonism and conflicts have also been intensifying. If stabilizing price trading firms can be adopted now; and can resonate with the Leveling Fund's foreign exchange management methods, then its effectiveness can reach the greatest stage. In this way, the maintenance of the city's industry and commerce, the activities of speculation and hoarding, and all social problems can be effectively remedied. We sincerely hope that relevant personnel will pay attention to this.

### Yarn and Cotton: US Cotton Falls More Sharply, Indian Cotton Shows Mixed Fluctuations

The New York cotton market fell due to a lack of major buyers, coupled with Southern hedging sales, and the wait-and-see attitude of textile merchants without any action. As a result, the market fell sharply, and both spot and forward prices fell sharply by 26 to 30 points per pound compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to purchases by operators, and then fell slightly due to sales by futures merchants. Later, speculators helped buyers and recovered. As a result, each rose or fell by 3/4 to 2 rupees 25. It is also predicted that the opening price tomorrow will fall by 2 rupees 5.

According to a New York telegram on the 20th, from August 1 to September 19 this year, a total of (1,242,000) bales of US cotton were listed, the cumulative amount used by factories was (1,239,000 bales), and the stock in each port city was (5,272,000 bales) (each bale is 500 pounds).

### Metals: Canadian Lead is Scarce

Canadian green lead is scarce in the market, and the market is unusually strong, higher than (Selby) goods by about 20 yuan per dan. There are still many people inquiring and searching for it in the market, and the market is good. The minds of those holding goods are naturally high. It is found that the market price yesterday was 620 yuan per dan, while the (Selby) variety is still quoted at 600 yuan per dan. It is heard that a certain organization intends to purchase in large quantities, so it is learned that the future trend may improve again. In addition, such as black iron billets, tinplate, etc., because the Tianjin gang is about to handle them, the market is particularly prosperous, which has also brought a lot of improvement to the market. Currently, the standard of this variety has also been raised by 20 to 30 yuan. For example, 200-pound American tinplate is sold for 800 yuan per box, 200-pound old steel factory Hui Si iron is sold for 730 yuan per box, and new steel factory goods are also priced at 720 yuan. A 2,000-pound black iron billet must be sold for 5,000 yuan per bundle, which is slightly firmer than before.

### Import and Export: Soybeans Shipped to South China

Yesterday (the 21st), 370 bags of soybeans were exported to Hong Kong, and another 300 bags of soybeans were exported to Singapore.

### Economic Warfare

Authored by Einzig, Translated by Xie Juhui

Economic aggression inevitably leads to economic warfare; economic warfare necessitates both defensive and offensive economic strategies; and these offensive and defensive maneuvers require tactics and tools. This is the rationale behind writing the book "Economic Warfare." The book, originally written by the British author Paul Einzig and translated by Xie Juhui, draws on the author's experiences in the First World War and research into the economic realities of the current war, making it a truly timely work. The book begins with a general study of wartime economics, then proceeds to individual analyses of the war economies of Germany, France, Italy, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. One cannot help but admire the author's comprehensive approach. However, as the author is, after all, British, he inevitably exudes a Chamberlain-esque air. Thus, his expectations regarding the Far Eastern war economy, though a small part, are unduly high, ultimately falling short of his hopes. Perhaps today, the author understands that it is difficult to prevent a nation from being warlike when it is inclined to be so. Yet, one cannot blame the author, as even now, some British people, seeking temporary respite, still dream of achieving peace in the Pacific without a long-term plan, indulging in wishful thinking. Nevertheless, military warfare leads to economic warfare, and economic warfare inevitably fuels military warfare. War, by definition, involves conflict, and ultimately, economic warfare cannot withstand the force of military warfare with airplanes and cannons. Recognizing this, we should seek practical theories from economic warfare to understand how to build economic fortresses, unafraid of the onslaught of war, in order to transition from wartime economics to the peaceful economy after the entire war ends. Mr. Xie is well-versed in economics and proficient in writing. His usual works have already provided insightful views. Therefore, the excellent writing style and clear reasoning of this book need no further introduction from the editor.

Shanghai's import and export trade, previously disrupted by the black market exchange rates and the turbulent situation, once fell into chaos. However, after the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands implemented fund freezes on July 26, and Japan began to ban the export of certain goods in retaliation, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee decided on August 18 to supply foreign exchange at the rates of US$5.34375 and GB£3.1875, providing a strong guarantee for importers and dealing a significant blow to speculators. As a result, trade has returned to normalcy, and the initial adjustment of the Shanghai foreign exchange market has been successful.

Increased Exports Due to Convenient Shipping

The smallest was sugar, at only 454 yuan (legal tender). The main reason for the increase in exports in August was the slight improvement in shipping, but the adjustment of the exchange market also had an indirect impact.

### Soviet Emigrant Association Strictly Guarded

The Continental Daily News reports that the reporter met with Mr. Pouffindau, Director of the Information Bureau of the French Concession Police Department, who stated that he had not heard of the closure of all cultural and other institutions belonging to the Soviet Emigrant Association on Avenue Foch. The various rumors circulating are considered to be fabrications. Well-informed sources believe that this rumor originated from propaganda by anti-communist Russian-language newspapers in this city. In view of this situation, the French Concession police authorities have specially increased security within the association to prevent incidents, but there has been no action to close down the various institutions of the association.

### Bomb Explodes at Suzhou Station, No Casualties as it Occurred Late at Night

According to the Pingming News Agency, at 3:15 AM on the 20th, a bomb suddenly exploded at Suzhou Station. The explosion was extremely loud, and residents throughout the city were awakened from their sleep. It is reported that the bomb exploded inside the western flag area of Suzhou Station, between eight and ten meters from the platform. It was a pre-planted time bomb. In addition to destroying a small section of the tracks, the goods loaded and unloaded on the southwest branch line of the station were also severely damaged. However, it is reported that there were no casualties. After the incident, the Japanese immediately dispatched a large number of soldiers and police to tightly guard the area around the incident site, and they sealed off the four gates to conduct house-to-house searches. Because it was late at night, the people were greatly disturbed. It is reported that several civilians were arrested. According to the Japanese, the purpose of the bombing was to destroy stationary freight cars.

### Registration Procedures for Selling Domestic Goods to Southeast Asia

Domestic goods in this city are now quite popular with overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Therefore, the number of goods shipped to Southeast Asia increases every year. As a result, it is necessary to register trademarks for these goods in that region. However, merchants in this city are concerned about the lack of knowledge of the procedures. Therefore, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce office in Hong Kong inquired with the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce for details. The response has been received and is recorded below. "For trademarks of goods not from British territories that wish to be registered locally, their local branch or manager can handle it on their behalf. If there is no branch or agent, the simplest method is for the principal to authorize a local lawyer in writing to act as their representative." As for the fees, according to the legal counsel of the Chamber, the registration fee for each trademark is 100 Straits dollars (including lawyer's fees, registration fees, stamp duties, and everything else). If the principal registers multiple trademarks at the same time, the fees will be reduced accordingly. If the principal is a limited company, the handling fee will be increased by 15 Singapore dollars.

### Thousands of People Took to the Streets Yesterday to Watch the Miracle of the Solar Eclipse, Citizens Looked Up and Observed with Excitement, but Clouds Obstructed a Clear View

The total solar eclipse, spanning 3,500 kilometers across eight provinces of China, and only seen in China since 399 years from the Ming Jiajing period, appeared before the eyes of millions of people in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. However, due to the cloudy weather and dark clouds yesterday, the spectacular phenomenon could not be fully seen, which was regrettable. The solar eclipse yesterday started in the Caucasus region of Russia at 12:02 PM, but central China and the southeast coast could also see it at the same time. The first appearance of a black shadow on the sun in Shanghai was around 12:30 PM, but it could not be fully seen due to the dense clouds. Later, the clouds dispersed slightly, and half of the sun had been eclipsed by the shadow of the moon. At that time, pedestrians on the street were all looking up, and some people were intently observing from the roofs of high buildings. At 1:10 PM, most of the sun was eclipsed, with only a sliver of the edge visible, looking like a crescent moon. At 1:30 PM, it was almost completely eclipsed, with only a thin circle visible. At that time, dark clouds formed again, and people were disappointed that they could not see the disappearance of the shadow of the moon. Around 2:00 PM, the weather suddenly cleared, and the sun shone brightly. The solar eclipse, seen once every few centuries, became a thing of the past. According to the astronomical observatory's prediction, the sky would be dark during the solar eclipse yesterday, like night. If there were no clouds, first-magnitude stars would be visible. Unfortunately, the sky did not change at noon yesterday. Although rain clouds were dense in the northwest corner, suggesting rain, the southeast corner was as bright as ever, without any change. Otherwise, daytime darkness and thousands of people taking to the streets to watch the solar eclipse would have been a great spectacle.

The Eclipse Lasted Over Two Hours Before Returning to Full Circle

Around 1:35 PM, the clouds thinned slightly, and the sun's disk began to show. At 1:40 PM, the sun's disk, like a crescent moon, was seen through the gaps in the clouds, sometimes deep and sometimes thin. At the maximum eclipse, only a tenth of the sun's disk was visible, but there were no solar corona or prominences, due to the partial eclipse. At 1:48 PM, the moon's shadow gradually moved eastward, and the sun's disk became like a waning crescent moon. At 1:55 PM, it was completely covered by clouds. At 2:30 PM, the clouds parted and the sun came out. At that time, one-tenth of the sun's disk was still eclipsed by the moon's shadow. At 2:35 PM, it returned to a full circle, with the sun shining as brightly as ever, making it impossible to look directly at it.

Astronomical Observatory Satisfied with Results

According to Father Gherig of the Xujiahui Astronomical Observatory, the observation results were very satisfactory. The extent of this solar eclipse was rare. The observation results will be published after sorting. Father Gherig and his assistants recorded the rare miracle of the solar system with observation equipment and astronomical instruments. However, because Shanghai's location was relatively biased, it was not possible to witness the complete darkness. Otherwise, noon would have turned into midnight. It is said that the astronomical observatory refused outside visitors yesterday and moved lunch forward by one hour to focus on observation work. The public, skilled in photography, also held cameras to take photos of the solar eclipse.

Difficult to Observe Due to Cloudy Skies

The solar eclipse began at approximately 12:00 PM and ended at 2:35 PM. Although Shanghai did not fall into complete darkness, as generally expected, the sunlight was cut off for several minutes, like dusk. However, due to the dense clouds and fog in the city's sky, the solar eclipse could not be seen clearly. However, in the moment of dispersal of the clouds, the miraculous sight of the moon's shadow covering the sun was glimpsed. It is a pity that there were few such opportunities.

The Solar Eclipse Appeared and Disappeared Intermittently

Since 10:00 AM, the crowds were perched on rooftops, looking forward to the arrival of the miracle. Most carried glass blackened with soot, while others carried sunglasses and binoculars with pre-installed colored glass plates. Around noon, the sky gradually darkened, and the solar eclipse had roughly begun. At this time, the mood of the observing crowd gradually became tense. The sky gradually darkened, and the moon's shadow gradually merged with the sun's disk and obscured one side of it. However, it could not be clearly seen due to the obstruction of layered clouds. The crowds on the road stopped to look up at the sky. However, because the layered clouds came and went, the solar eclipse appeared and disappeared intermittently, so many observers could not enjoy it to the fullest.

Special Broadcast Hindered

The Chongqing International Broadcasting Station had planned to rebroadcast the solar eclipse spectacle from the Linxia Northwest Solar Eclipse Observation Team at the Lanzhou Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications, using a 25-meter non-directional wavelength, from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM yesterday, to the enjoyment of listeners who could not witness the solar eclipse spectacle in person. However, the reporter asked a specialist to listen to this report within the specified time, but nothing was heard. According to experts, this was because the spots in the sun interfered with the signal during the solar eclipse.

### Excellent Driving Skills Save Lives

Recently, there have been frequent incidents of cars causing disasters and killing people. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council has promoted a safety campaign, the results have been minimal. One reason is the carelessness of pedestrians, and the other is the negligence of drivers. If a car is driven properly, it can save lives in an instant. At 6:00 PM on the 20th, car No. 2716 was traveling west on Xinzha Road. Near the Jiangning Guild Hall on Chengdu Road, a child about eight or nine years old suddenly crossed the road to the south, disregarding the oncoming car. At that moment, the car was close to the child. Just as people were worrying about the child's danger, the car stopped instantly, and the child was leaning against the front of the car, avoiding danger and without injury. This was definitely due to the driver's skill, and he did not get out of the car to beat or scold the child, but drove away. If the car had moved forward by half a foot, the child would have been knocked down and killed or injured. From this, we can see that even if a pedestrian is occasionally careless, a driver who values life can save lives in a moment of crisis. This is especially commended.

### New Location for U.S. Military Club Planned for Sixth Floor of the Great World

According to the North China Daily News, the old site of the U.S. Marine Corps Club on Jing'an Temple Road has been sold to the Shanghai Jewish Community and must be vacated by October 1. The club is looking for a new building. It was recently discussed to borrow the British Church on Avenue Edward VII, but this was abandoned because the church could not meet the needs of the U.S. military club. It is now learned that the U.S. military has begun negotiations with the Great World Company to borrow the sixth floor of the company's building to convert it into a club. The Great World Company has informed the company's owner in Hong Kong. The sixth floor of the Great World originally housed a ballroom and restaurant. If the U.S. military rents it, it will be converted into a suitable recreation area for U.S. officers and soldiers. At the same time, the U.S. military authorities are still working hard to find a new location for the club, but it is said that there are many difficulties.

### Cotton Catches Fire in Japanese Warehouse

On the day before yesterday (the 20th), at 4:20 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the Shanghai Port Cotton Association warehouse of a Japanese merchant, located at the intersection of Tongzhou Road and Youheng Road in Hongkou. The warehouse had recently stored a large quantity of cotton. Unexpectedly, a fire ignited in the cotton pile, causing a roaring blaze and dense smoke. After a delay, the Japanese side received the news and rushed to extinguish the fire, which took a long time to put out. A significant amount of cotton was destroyed, resulting in a considerable loss. Afterwards, the Japanese side inspected the ashes and discovered substances like sulfur, leading them to believe that the fire was intentionally set. It was also said that this was the second time the warehouse had been set on fire. Therefore, the Japanese side has been conducting a strict investigation for several days.

Yesterday afternoon at 2:45 PM, British merchant's Route 3 trolley car No. 35, after turning around at the end of Dongxin Bridge, was heading north from south. When it reached the turn at Zhejiang Road and Hubei Road, a rickshaw No. 1834 pulled by Zhang Jinfu (37 years old) from Jiangbei, carrying a young man in a Western suit, sped up and attempted to cross to the right side of the trolley. Unexpectedly, trolley car No. 23 on Route 3 was approaching from north to south at the same time. The rickshaw puller could not avoid it in time, causing the rickshaw to be caught between the two trolleys. The puller was knocked down and rolled under trolley No. 23. His left arm and leg bones were crushed, and his head and chest were also severely injured. The passenger was fortunate enough to jump out of the rickshaw with quick wits. Later, Chinese police officers summoned an ambulance to the scene and managed to rescue Zhang Jinfu from under the trolley, sending him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, he succumbed to his injuries and died at around 10 PM. It was later discovered that the rickshaw belonged to the F茂 Printing House at No. 97, Lane 727, Tianxia Road.

### Hand Grenade Placed Inside Jinling Restaurant - Son of Restaurant Owner Chen Kidnapped Last Month - Gangsters Send Grenade with Letter Threatening Extortion

A hand grenade was suddenly discovered in Jinling Restaurant at No. 421, intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Baliqiao Road in the French Concession, yesterday afternoon, as an act of intimidation. The owner of Jinling Restaurant is Chen Qinghai, a Cantonese man, 48 years old, who rents a residence at No. 1, Mingde Village, intersection of Rue du Père Robert and Rue Cassini. He also owns Datong Restaurant on Avenue Joffre and Route Massenet, which is also doing quite well. At 1:00 PM on the 28th of last month, Chen's youngest son (three months old) was taken by his hired wet nurse (from Jiangbei), Ms. So-and-so, to play near the lane entrance. Unexpectedly, he went missing. Afterwards, Chen immediately reported the information to the French police station and requested an investigation. Many days have passed since then, but there has been no news. Until 12:05 PM yesterday, a tea server, A, at Jinling Restaurant suddenly discovered a small blue cloth package under the fifth dining table in the eastern section of the downstairs snack bar. Thinking it was left behind by a diner, he took it to the counter. Upon opening it, he was shocked to find a hand grenade inside, along with a letter to Chen demanding a huge sum of money as ransom for his child. Chen was then informed and reported it to the police station, who dispatched officers to take the grenade away and rigorously investigate the gangsters.

### Seven Arrested Youths Transferred to the Japanese Side

Some time ago, the Japanese side sent personnel to collaborate with French police officers in areas such as Lane in Rue du Père Robert and Baixiang Village, arresting a total of seven Chinese male youths and individuals resembling female students. They were detained at the French police station for investigation. It was not until 5:00 PM the day before yesterday that the Japanese side extradited them and transferred them to Hongkou for questioning. Furthermore, at around 11:00 PM the night before last, the Japanese side again collaborated with French police officers to arrest people on Route Laguerre, but no one was apprehended.

### Shen Bao Readers' Student Aid Fund - Donation Report

The owner of Rong Yichang Leather Goods Factory at No. 1030, Jing'an Temple Road, contributed the congratulatory gifts from friends for the expansion of the factory, making up one thousand yuan to donate to student aid.

Congratulatory Gifts for Student Aid

To the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund Committee, Rong Yichang Leather Goods Store is the result of Faqin's forty years of painstaking efforts in management and creation. After the fall of Suzhou, it moved to Shanghai to set up a shop. Last month, it moved to No. 130 Jing'an Temple Road to expand its business and restore the main factory. More than one hundred and fourteen friends gave gifts. Faqin should have set up a modest thank you. However, thinking that material resources are difficult, it is not appropriate to waste useful money on meaningless consumption. We have long admired your museum's student aid program, which rewards students and is practical. We will use this expense to combine it into one thousand yuan in national currency and send it to be used as a fund. We have done our best to repay the kindness. I will definitely be appreciated. All the titles of relatives and friends who gave gifts are listed on another piece of paper, and I would like to ask you to publish them to express my gratitude.

### Good Housekeeping

— Editor

Excellent housekeeping is indeed a science and an art. The latest scientific methods can be used for things such as raising children, maintaining health, and managing finances. Previous legends and even grandmother's experience need to be tested and should not be blindly followed. If scientific methods can be used in the family, it will indirectly promote the progress of science.

How to cut a piece of clothing to save fabric, how to cook dishes to make the same vegetables taste better, how to furnish a room to make life more comfortable, and even how to take a bus to save money. Whether these measures are appropriate is enough to see the housewife's artistic skills.

The housewife's every move is enough to affect everything in society: if housewives do not choose carefully when buying goods, then industry and commerce will produce many shoddy goods; if housewives blindly stick to old methods, the latest scientific equipment will not be used. If housewives read books, newspapers and magazines in their spare time, it can increase sales. And whether the economic management is appropriate, whether the treatment of husband and children is appropriate, is enough to affect the stability of the family and the husband's career.

Therefore, good housekeeping can be said to be a key to the connection between the family and society.

### Regret of the Great British Novelist Charles Dickens

— Xu Baiyi

The great British novelist Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was a philosopher of the Victorian era. He once said, "People who can enjoy a peaceful life at home are the happiest." In fact, this sentence was said with feeling. Because Dickens' married life was not happy, he and his wife announced their separation after 22 years of marriage. The reason was that in the year he was 44 years old, he fell in love with Ellen Ternan, an 18-year-old actress.

Naturally, when a husband has an affair, the wife cannot avoid negotiating with him for the peaceful atmosphere in the family. From then on, Dickens broke himself for his mistakes, and he still envied those who enjoy a peaceful life in the family. If we regard his words as a motto, we will not be fooled by his old age.

According to the research of marriage experts, the fifth year after a couple gets married is a dangerous period, because by this time, each other's shortcomings are constantly discovered, so they feel dissatisfied with each other once, twice, and three times, and cracks occur in their feelings. Dickens fell in love with an actress 22 years after his marriage, and his wife had already given birth to not eleven children for him. As a result, he suffered lifelong pain because of their incompatible feelings, and received an alimony of 600 pounds a year after the separation.

However, in fact, Mrs. Dickens also had considerable shortcomings. It is said that she has no sense of humor, is not good at managing the family, and is not clean at all, while Dickens is a master of managing the family and is the most cultured banquet host. When two such opposite personalities come together, unfortunate results will naturally occur.

Some people say that marriage is the tomb of love. In fact, it is wrong. Marriage is actually the starting point of love. After marriage, the couple should adapt to the environment, think for each other, satisfy each other, do the work of correcting themselves, and eliminate the selfish habits developed in childhood. The peaceful family life that Dickens hoped for was originally something that everyone could enjoy.

### "Beating" Education

— Peizhen

"Beating" children is a very common thing in ordinary families; but what is the effect of "beating" is a huge question. From my actual observation, the effect is probably equal to zero.

The reason why most parents use "beating" is probably for the following reasons:

First, it is to carry out strict "family education". When children make some mistakes or faults, they use "beating" to punish them and urge them to repent or correct their mistakes; second, parents sometimes have unpleasant moods or frustrations in the environment, so they vent their anger on the children. If they are slightly disobedient, they will be beaten and scolded. Naturally, there is no educational intention in this kind of child as an outlet.

Even if we discuss the former, the result of implementing "family education" can indeed make children submit for a while, but it will never achieve its expected educational effect, such as making them reflect on where the fault lies and deeply understand why they should not do so. Therefore, once the pain is over, they will forget it and be as stubborn as before, and play as before. We see some families beating and scolding all day long, but the children's bad behavior is increasing day by day. This can also prove the bankruptcy of "beating" education.

Proper children's education must adopt the method of persuasion by both guidance and persuasion, so that the children's psychology is gradually imperceptibly changed, and only in this way can the children be truly introduced into a regular and reasonable path.

### Mid-Autumn Mooncakes and Hygiene

— Qiuse

"How many times in life do you see the moon at its zenith?" When Mid-Autumn Festival arrives, everyone feels an unspeakable joy in their spirits. Buying some mooncakes and sharing them with family members as a seasonal food is an extremely common and ordinary thing. Most mooncakes are sweet, and young people especially like them. Who knows, "disease enters from the mouth?" As a result of eating mooncakes, the stomach and intestines are often affected a lot. Everyone thinks that this is because they eat too much. I think that eating too much is indeed harmful, but unhygienic mooncakes can easily cause disease even if you eat less. Therefore, eating Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes is more about quality than quantity. The so-called quality is not necessarily about the filling, but about the ingredients and manufacturing methods that meet hygiene standards. Which mooncakes are hygienic and which mooncakes are unhygienic, at present, there is no responsible public agency to inspect and prove them. It all depends on the parents themselves to pay attention and investigate. One day, I passed by the New World Department Store and, through the introduction of a friend, visited their mooncake manufacturing site, which was newly established this year. All the ingredients and seasoning, baking and other procedures can be applied using scientific methods. According to the person in charge, they regard hygiene as the only goal of making mooncakes and are unwilling to be sloppy in the slightest. I believe that parents who buy mooncakes have a psychology, that is, spending money is a small matter, but hygiene is a big deal! I am also unwilling to sing a high note, saying that we should not eat mooncakes during the national crisis, but eating mooncakes must take hygiene into consideration. This is the minimum condition! Writing to this point, I will come to 40,000 small poems and write a lullaby: "New World Mooncakes relieve thousands of sorrows, wanderers are at the end of the world for several autumns, to thank the affectionate host, the fragrance remains on the lips and cheeks to remember the delicacies." "Infinite clear light shines on the building, New World Mooncakes relieve thousands of sorrows, talking about the vicissitudes of life together, not weeping like Chu prisoners in the cowl." "Such a clear night scene, a pure heart heals lovesickness, New World Mooncakes relieve thousands of desires, the spirit of the moon peeps through the window, human sounds are quiet." "Why bother to seek hard in life, collect the beautiful autumn scenery in your eyes, after the catastrophe, let's enjoy the rest of our lives, New World Mooncakes relieve thousands of sorrows."

### Several Common Problems with Clothing

— Daoyi

Chest too tight: Although many women advocate not binding their chests, some women think that slender bodies are fashionable, and their clothes are made extremely thin, so they can't help but bind their chests. Therefore, the breasts and internal organs are under pressure. In fact, this is easy to cause problems.

Waist too tight: Most women's clothes are tightly bound around the waist, with a thin waist being considered beautiful, but how do they know that the waist is under pressure, which can easily cause indigestion, stomach problems, and other diseases? Women! How painful it is to lose your health in order to pursue fashion!

### One Week's Regular Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

In this era of "tofu being sold at the price of meat," every family in the salary class is probably shaking their heads and sighing! Especially the housewives in the family, who have to take charge of buying vegetables every morning, is simply a difficult task. Just these two kinds of meat and vegetables, which must be delicious and cheap, also make people feel overwhelmed and difficult to please. What cheap and delicious things do you want to eat with meat at one yuan per catty and green vegetables at four or five jiao per catty? The author is one of the housewives, and I feel that buying vegetables every day is many times more difficult than writing an article. It is very difficult to arrange this week's menu, because I can only do some "suggestions" for what to eat today, and I can no longer take into account the word economy.

Monday

Fried tofu with meat, sweet and sour fried yellow croaker, hundred-leaf fried green vegetables, sesame oil steamed eggplant

Spring and Autumn

### Seeing the Light of Day Again

— Ping

Yesterday at 1:30 PM, the solar eclipse occurred. The citizens of Shanghai looked up at the sky, feeling a moment of darkness. However, everyone knew that this was a momentary darkness, and the light would eventually reappear.

This solar eclipse can be said to have shaken the world. Countries have sent observation teams to the solar eclipse zone. In the southeastern part of China, it is of course the most convenient to go to Chong'an, Fujian for observation. The Fuzhou area of Fujian was able to see the light of day again. It can be said that it was a natural creation. I wonder how happy and excited the people of Fuzhou will be.

During the solar eclipse, everyone cherished the blue sky and the white sun. Witnessing the scene, they could not help but feel sad. When the sunlight shines and returns to normal, everyone naturally feels that the white light is even more lovely. A moment of darkness, the light will eventually reappear. After watching the solar eclipse, I believe even more that our great rivers and mountains will surely be able to shine!

### The Value of Perseverance in Seeking Knowledge

— Cheng Hao

Encouragement to Fellow Students in Supplementary Schools

In this era of commercialized schools, many young people, due to impoverished family circumstances and parents unable to afford their tuition, are forced to seek employment without completing their education. Naturally, they feel inadequate in terms of knowledge. However, they possess a strong desire for knowledge and utilize their spare time to attend supplementary schools.

In recent years, supplementary schools have sprung up like bamboo shoots in this city, and the student population is also large. Supplementary education has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. Many companies and businesses sponsor apprentices to attend supplementary schools. The Ministry of Education has also promulgated regulations for supplementary schools to promote the development of supplementary education. This time, the Shen Bao newspaper's Reader Scholarship Campaign has adopted the opinions of readers and employees, allocating a portion of the donations from enthusiastic readers specifically to subsidize industrial and commercial employees. This provides an opportunity for industrial and commercial employees who lack the financial resources to attend supplementary schools, which is truly a commendable initiative.

Speaking of universities, institutions such as the Shanghai University School of Business, the Daxia University School of Law and School of Business, Guanghua University, and Chengming College have established evening classes or classes held in the evenings to facilitate advanced academic research for young professionals. Given these opportunities for schooling, I believe that every young professional who feels inadequate in their knowledge should seize the opportunity, choose a suitable school and class, to supplement their knowledge on one hand, and increase work efficiency on the other, which also contributes to society.

Based on my past experience studying in supplementary schools, I believe that the biggest shortcoming of supplementary school students is a lack of perseverance. I still remember the day when supplementary school classes started, the teacher would always say something like this to the students: "Wow! There are many students here today. It would be great if this spirit could be maintained for the next few months." (Editor's note: This point is similar to the opinion expressed in Yu Renjun's article "I am an Apprentice, I Want to Study," so the following is omitted.)

Logically, the vast majority of industrial and commercial employees who attend supplementary schools do so voluntarily, and should naturally feel interested in studying hard. The reason why they become lazy over time is due to the lack of the aforementioned perseverance. Therefore, I feel that every industrial and commercial employee, in terms of academic advancement, in addition to carefully selecting a school and not seeking extravagance, should also have a "relentless spirit," and constantly strive tirelessly. After all, learning is not a matter of one morning or evening. Even students who specialize in studying and researching in schools must spend six years in junior and senior high school and four years in university. Moreover, industrial and commercial employees have professional commitments, and attend classes for only two or three hours a day, so they must work harder to achieve results. I sincerely hope that supplementary school students will sweep away the past phenomenon of "starting but not finishing," and once they enter supplementary school, they should see it through to the end, cultivating a spirit of "dedication to work, enjoyment of career, and diligent pursuit of progress." In particular, industrial and commercial employees who receive reader scholarships should work even harder in order to live up to the generous intentions of the reader scholarships.

Humph! Friends, I will never be discouraged, no matter how much you glare at me with triangular eyes or reveal your fangs in a sinister smile, showing off your triumph; but when I achieve my desire to return the object to its owner, I will be even more triumphant. I gradually felt a burst of pain in my elbow. When I lifted my sleeve, part of it was already soaked with blood. A large bump was imprinted on my knee. A quarter of my long gown was stained black. One of my socks was also torn to shreds. I was angry, I cursed selfishness. I never expected that this group of people would take advantage of the situation to satisfy their unreasonable desires.

### Is It True That People Don't Pick Up Lost Items?

— Wang Sanchuan

When I was walking home after finishing my official business, a rickshaw sped past me on the road. The rickshaw puller's back was shaking desperately, and two disheveled women were sitting in the rickshaw, a middle-aged woman supporting an older woman. Clearly, the older woman was sick. The rickshaw body trembled, and suddenly a roll of banknotes slid out from under the mudguard next to the rickshaw. I realized that misfortune had befallen them, and I did not hesitate to shout loudly, because only in this way could I alert them: Hey! Women in the rickshaw! You dropped your money! At the same time, I stepped forward and bent down to pick it up. At that moment, suddenly several hands stretched out from around me, converging on the same point. However, I had the advantage of being near the water and was finally victorious. But I didn't expect that those few disappointed hands would immediately turn and push towards me. I, who was taking the brunt of the impact, slipped and uncontrollably rushed towards the streetcar tracks, falling head over heels.

### A Small Statistic of Car Thefts

— Zhuang Gong

In 1939, only seven private cars were stolen in the Shanghai Concession area. In 1940, the number of stolen private cars increased to forty. In the first half of 1941, the number soared to ninety-three. Among them, three were recovered in 1939, thirty in 1940, and sixty-one have been recovered so far in 1941. In July 1941 alone, thirty-six vehicles were stolen, of which twenty-one have been recovered. According to investigations, the value of the stolen vehicles mostly ranged from 15,000 to 50,000 national currency units.

Anecdotes

### Biographical Notes on the "Civet Cat Case"

— Liu Tang

3.  Consort Li Chen

In the opera, there is a scene where Consort Li enters a dilapidated kiln, which is of course an absurd interpolation. However, when the emperor truly passed away, she once followed the entourage to guard the Yongding Mausoleum, which was customary for imperial concubines. In the opera, there is also a scene where Emperor Renzong licks Consort Li's eyes, but this is actually something Emperor Renzong did for his aunt, and it is applied to his birth mother instead. The Grand Princess of Wei, Emperor Renzong's aunt, became blind in her later years due to illness. Emperor Renzong brought a doctor to examine her, and everyone from the empress and concubines down visited to inquire. The emperor personally licked her eyes, and everyone around was moved to tears, and the emperor was also deeply saddened. At that time, Consort Li had already passed away. Consort Li died in the first year of the Mingdao era, suffering from a serious illness. She was granted the title of Consort Chen before her death, at the age of forty-six. Empress Liu died the following year. If she had died one or two years later, she could have enjoyed the honor of Empress Dowager. Consort Li was born with ill fortune and died before Empress Liu. Empress Liu wanted to bury her with the rites for a palace maid. When Lu Yijian went to court, he asked about the death of a palace concubine. Empress Liu led Emperor Renzong to rise, and after a while, she sat alone under the curtain and summoned Yijian to ask: A palace maid died, what does the Prime Minister say? Yijian said: Your Majesty, I am the Prime Minister in name only, and I should be involved in everything, internal and external. Empress Liu angrily said, Does the Prime Minister want to sow discord between mother and son? Yijian calmly replied: If Your Majesty does not care about the Liu family, I dare not speak; but if you still care about the Liu family, then the funeral rites should be grand. Empress Liu understood and immediately said: The palace maid is Li Chenfei. What should be done? Yijian then requested that the funeral be conducted with the rites of a first-rank official, and the coffin be placed in Hongfu Monastery. Yijian also said to Luo Chongdong, the Eunuch Supervisor: Consort Chen should be dressed in empress's robes for burial, and the coffin should be filled with mercury, so that you cannot say later that Yijian never mentioned it. Chongdong did as he said.

Consort Li's life was mostly like this, which shows that the story of the civet cat is absurd and unfounded. When she gave birth to Emperor Renzong, she was already twenty-three years old, which further shows that Empress Liu did not want her to serve Emperor Zhenzong early.
