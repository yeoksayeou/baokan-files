Captain James Roosevelt, the eldest son of President Roosevelt, arrived in Hong Kong at 4:00 PM and is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on the 29th. After staying for four days, he will proceed to Rangoon to inspect the Burma Road. This move has significant implications for the United States' material aid to China. When James arrived in Hong Kong, Yu Hongjun, representative of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Zhong E, representative of Vice President Kong, welcomed him at the airport.

When asked about the exact purpose of his visit to China, Roosevelt declined to answer, only stating that he was under strict orders from Washington and that he would remain silent and refrain from commenting. His fellow traveler, Major Thomas, previously worked for the China National Aviation Corporation. It is speculated that the aircraft will be handed over to a British aviation officer to fly to Singapore or Hong Kong. (Dispatch, 27th)

Hong Kong: James Roosevelt, the eldest son of President Roosevelt, arrived here by plane this afternoon accompanied by Major Thomas. According to Roosevelt's statement to the reporter from the Central News Agency, this is his first visit to China, and therefore, he is extremely eager to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He will remain in Chongqing for four days before departing for Burma. When the reporter inquired about the official purpose of his visit to China, Roosevelt avoided answering, merely stating that he was under direct military orders from Washington and was visiting China as an "observer." Future itineraries would be directly instructed by Washington, so it was difficult to make any predictions. The reporter then inquired whether he carried a personal letter from President Roosevelt to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He replied, "I cannot say, as I brought many letters from Washington." After disembarking from the plane, Roosevelt was driven to his residence to rest and then received reporters. The reporters posed many questions, to which Roosevelt responded with humor. One reporter asked whether the U.S. fleet in the Pacific would immediately begin escorting ships. He replied, "It would be best to ask my father about this." Another reporter asked whether it was true that Roosevelt would serve as a military advisor to Chongqing, as claimed by the Japanese. Roosevelt said that he had not heard of this and that he was not very familiar with military affairs. He was only a Marine Corps officer stationed in San Diego and was ordered to come to the Far East as an observer. Tonight, Roosevelt and Thomas will be hosted at a banquet by Yu Hongjun. Roosevelt is scheduled to arrive in Chongqing next Tuesday. (Dispatch, 26th)

### Guo Taiqi to Go to Washington, D.C. to Discuss Matters with U.S. Authorities; Song Ziwen Believes Signing of Equalization Agreement Is Concrete Expression of Democratic Nations' Support for China

Washington: Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, stated yesterday that the trilateral agreement between China, Britain, and the United States on equalization funds shows that "these two major democratic nations of the West are not just friends of China in words only." Song made this statement to reporters after the China, Britain, and United States signed the equalization fund agreement separately to stabilize the Chinese legal tender (fabi). At the same time, Washington is preparing to welcome Guo Taiqi, the former Chinese ambassador to Britain, en route from Chongqing to assume the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. Guo's itinerary here includes discussions with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull on Tuesday and a luncheon with British Ambassador to the U.S., Lord Halifax, on Thursday.

Chongqing Newspapers Praise Sino-American Agreement

Chongqing: This morning, newspapers in Chongqing praised the signing of the Sino-American and Sino-British Equalization Fund Agreements, saying that the simultaneous signing of the two agreements showed the parallel nature of British and American policies of aid to China. The Sino-British Daily News stated that the statements of Morgenthau and Song Ziwen were tantamount to saying that the United States and China not only have close cooperation in the financial field but also have implemented cooperation in all aspects to protect the basic principles of freedom, which implies that in addition to economic cooperation, there is also political cooperation. As far as the agreements themselves are concerned, both were finalized more than a hundred days ago. Therefore, this equalization fund is of a hygienic nature for Chinese finance, rather than an emergency measure. In the Sino-Japanese currency war, this agreement will become the strongest fortress of Chinese finance. Moreover, due to the financial cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States, the financial institutions of Britain and the United States in China will inevitably strengthen their cooperation with the Chinese financial community in their inherent relationship. Ta Kung Pao said that the United States wants an early victory for democratic countries, so it believes that it will have a more active performance for China. As for Britain, which is fighting hard in Europe and still remembers China, this makes China especially grateful, because the depth of this meaning is not something that simple loan figures can include. (Havas News Agency Dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing: Chinese-language newspapers all published the news of the signing of the Sino-British and Sino-American financial loan agreements with large headlines, unanimously expressing their gratitude for the aid from Britain and the United States, and stating that Britain's heroic act in a time of difficulty and hardship is especially commendable. The financial community stated that this negotiation began in December of last year and lasted for nearly five months. This agreement is sufficient to consolidate the external value of the legal tender and to suppress prices. This agreement is closely related to the current international situation and the basic Far East policy of Britain and the United States. It fully expresses the determination of the two countries to protect the democratic countries and assist freedom. Our war of resistance is a struggle for democracy and freedom. Therefore, the basic policies of Britain, the United States, and China are obviously the same. This morning, the official Chinese newspaper published an article entitled "Further Cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States," stating that the Sino-British and Sino-American financial supply agreements can show that Britain and the United States continue to take parallel actions to aid China, and that Britain's setbacks in the Balkans cannot affect its Far East policy. At the same time, it can also express Britain's strength in assisting democratic countries to resist aggression. The newspaper also pointed out that this agreement will give the Chinese people great encouragement and further believes that it can imply that the close cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States is not limited to economic aspects. Xinhua Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, suggested withdrawing support for the Shanghai market and other occupied areas and increasing the supply of legal foreign exchange to free China, as it currently only accounts for one percent of the total. The newspaper also advocated appointing well-known public group leaders to supervise the use of loans and publishing details of payments on a regular basis to avoid financial leakage into private pockets.

Editorial

### Reflections on the European Situation

It seems that spring is a particularly favorable season for aggressive actions. Looking back at the European history of recent years, almost every year the Nazis have had a victorious performance in this season. For example, in 1938 there was the annexation of Austria, in 1939 there was the annexation of Czechoslovakia, and last year, after achieving a great victory in the Western Front war, its achievements seemed to have reached a peak. However, after nearly a year of tense stalemate, this year's Balkan War is still a military achievement for the Nazis. These days, the whole world is shocked by this new change. Amidst the complacency of the aggressors, those who love justice have further increased the burden on their hearts.

It is said that history is blind and that mankind is always evolving; it is said that all development is rational, but there are constant phenomena of stagnation or even reversal. In fact, these two trends are not contradictory, but the latter is only a temporary phenomenon, while the former is the overall trend. There have been constant so-called Dark Ages in history, but the conquests of Genghis Khan and the autocratic rule of the Holy Alliance were both ephemeral and had only temporary effects. Moreover, in the past, people could only be ignorant, but today, with the development of science and the advancement of human intelligence, they have gradually acquired the consciousness and confidence to create a rational history. Violence and heavy troops can break through the Maginot Line, but they may not be able to destroy the strong barriers of the common psychology of the world's people. This is an important reason why the world should not be pessimistic because of seeing all kinds of unpleasant phenomena.

Looking at the recent facts, there are some bright factors under the entire darkness and chaos. The resistance wars of Yugoslavia and Greece have failed one after another, but this failure is glorious; the British and French allied forces, plus the Maginot Line, were not enough to contain the Nazi offensive. How could one expect this from small countries such as Greece and Yugoslavia? But the soldiers and civilians of Greece and Yugoslavia did not lose their courage because of their barren land and small population, nor did they compromise because of the successive surrenders of some large and small countries. They only know that territorial sovereignty cannot be violated, and that they would rather die than be unfree! Yugoslavia inherently had the same weakness as Czechoslovakia, with a complex mix of nationalities. Moreover, after Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria successively joined the Axis powers, they were surrounded on all sides, which had already destined them to a tragic fate of failure. They did not take surrender for granted because of this, and they would rather suffer the pain of defeat in a battle than seek survival by surrendering without a fight. This spirit is the driving force behind the Serbian nation's ability to regain its revival after being subjected to foreign rule for thousands of years, and it is also a powerful guarantee that this country will not be wiped off the map of Europe. As for Greece, compared with pre-war Belgium, apart from its relatively large territory, its industry, military equipment, and even population, culture, politics, and national economy were far inferior. However, the duration of the German-Greek War has been longer than the German-Belgian War last spring, and the German losses have been greater. In the end, the Greek government did not follow in the footsteps of the King of Belgium and abandon its comrades to surrender, but rather continued to fight in exile overseas. This, at the very least, will make the invaders realize that the courage and will of small countries are not entirely contemptible, and that their work of building a "new order" is still full of thorns.

Comparing these past few years of Nazi "spring victories," the annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia were both victories without a fight, which exactly met the aggressor's highest ideals. The Western Front victory last spring was the most astonishing, but it came at a heavy price. As for this Balkan War, it was only after a long period of painstaking management that the Nazis were finally forced to engage in a showdown of strength. To use this to deal with a backward Greece and a hastily responding British army, their ultimate victory was not only unsurprising to the world but also had no astonishing record to speak of. In the ten months since the end of the Western Front War last summer, the Nazis have not established any commendable military achievements abroad, and Italy's successive defeats have greatly burdened the Axis powers. Therefore, this victory, in terms of its domestic significance, is naturally urgently needed by the Nazis, although its value to the overall war situation is still another question.

The German achievements in the Balkans have only the significance of a local victory, and the overall victory or defeat still depends on the future competition of the main forces. However, after the evolution of the past year, the deployment of the global anti-aggression front has been far more thorough and stronger than before. First, maritime gains and losses are the most important factor. The world's sea power is still controlled by democratic countries, not only in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, but also in the Pacific. Second, the United States' concern and assistance for the anti-aggression war has increased geometrically with the progress of the aggression front. It is expected that its future measures will not be limited to expanding the scope of Atlantic patrols and providing financial loans to China. Third, the past policy of appeasement has almost been eradicated at its roots, and that illusion has no place to exist in either Europe or the Far East. On the other hand, it also fundamentally eliminates the possibility of the aggressor winning without a fight.

### Chinese Consul General in the Philippines Claims Chinese Nationals Willing to Fight for the Philippines; Chairman of U.S. Aviation Committee Says Philippine Islands Should Be Protected; Planes Headed for Singapore Arrive in Manila

Manila: The Chinese Consul General here, Yang Guangxing, has explained to the American representative in the Philippines and the Philippine President that in the event of an incident, 120,000 Chinese nationals in the Philippines are willing to serve the Philippines. The Japanese Consul General went to Naga, Philippines yesterday to discuss matters with Japanese nationals. That place is the center of the northern hemp industry and has a large number of Japanese nationals. Currently, Japanese merchants are closing their doors due to poor business, but they say they will still reside there. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)

Washington: Land, Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission, declared yesterday that he guarantees that the United States will continue to work to resolve the Philippine Islands' maritime crisis. He also stated that the Maritime Commission has always paid attention to the importance of the continued trade between the United States and the Philippine Islands and is determined to maintain the openness of this sea route. Land's remarks were published in "Philippine" magazine. In his article, Land said that the shortage of ships may be resolved. One solution is to encourage the establishment of a Philippine merchant fleet, and the second is to add more ships flying the American flag to serve the Philippine Islands. Land said that in view of the aid to Britain program and the general shortage of ships, there are few ships that can be sold to the Philippine Islands for application at this time. It may not be possible to give direct assistance to the Philippine Islands Shipping Company and expand its business. However, it is somewhat better to have more ships flying the American flag serve the Philippine Islands. The 500 ships still in the original construction process can meet the needs of the country's entire overseas trade. With this plan, American shipping companies operating in the Philippine Islands will have access to fast, economical, and modern ships. Combining these ships with the other ships in the past ten months, the tonnage of American ships in the Pacific can be increased by 125%. Although the current international situation is quite dim, the process of increasing the tonnage of Philippine Islands trading ships in the future is somewhat obstructed and difficult to implement. However, the Maritime Commission will definitely pay close attention to the importance of American commercial and Philippine Islands trade interests in deciding how to dispose of new ships. In the same magazine, Congressman Magnuson, a Democrat from Washington State, wrote an article strongly stating that as long as the Philippine Islands are under the American flag, the United States has a responsibility to defend the Philippine Islands against foreign enemies, and it is also the duty of the United States to cultivate the Philippine Islands' ability to defend itself in preparation for future independence. Magnuson also said that it is very important to train Philippine sailors to gain experience in operating small fleets, even if they only gain coastal patrol experience, it will be enough to increase the morale of the island's people, and this successful small fleet of training is enough to form the core of the Philippine Islands Navy. This navy, although small in strength, will be of inestimable help to the U.S. Navy patrolling this large area of the ocean. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)

Manila: The third huge "Consolidated B-24 Liberator" bomber, which was being shipped to Singapore for use by the British Air Force, arrived at Pan American Airways Airport in Cavite last night. This giant plane was piloted by Mr. Webbe, who came here attached to the plane. Mr. Webbe refused to comment and said that he was under strict orders from the Canadian Pacific Railway Air Lines authorities to remain silent and not comment. The pilot who came with him was Mr. Kasidon, who used to work for the China National Aviation Corporation. It is expected that this [plane] will be handed over to a British airman to fly to Singapore or Hong Kong. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)

### Philippine Island Promotion of Defense Program

Manila - Recent meetings in Manila between British and American representatives to discuss the defense of the Far East by American, Filipino, and British troops have greatly excited the authorities guarding the Philippine Islands. Consequently, they are now rapidly promoting the program for a complete Philippine civil defense force to prepare for all emergencies. Although the issue of the Philippine civil defense force was significantly mentioned in the meetings with various high-ranking officials, the active preparations on the part of the British and Americans have made the Philippine authorities feel that they have ample time for preparation. Recent reports from Washington state that the U.S. will use sugar taxes and gold devaluation, or loans from the Export-Import Bank, to subsidize the Philippine civil defense force, which is welcomed here. In the past few years, the development of the Philippine civil defense force has often been hampered by a lack of funding. Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, and General Grande, commander of the Philippine Islands, along with senior U.S. officials stationed in the Philippines, have repeatedly held meetings in late March and early April to discuss the Philippine civil defense program. At the same time, the National Emergency Affairs Committee, chaired by Defense Minister Sison and under the guidance of President Quezon, has also begun planning the civil defense program, the outline of which is as follows (any part or the entirety of the program must be carried out with the assistance of U.S. defense officials): (1) Determine locations for evacuating women, children, and non-essential personnel from cities such as Manila; (2) Government and private businesses should establish shelters for the residence of government personnel and those involved in government work; (3) Maintain and protect important public utilities; (4) Store gasoline, kerosene, and other military oils; (5) Maintain a supply of food and clean water, including canned meat, wheat, and daily necessities; (6) Maintain all transportation lines, ensuring the safety of electricity; (7) Preserve important sera and vaccines and purchase necessary surgical instruments; (8) People in various regions should organize volunteer defense groups. Defense Minister Sison stated that volunteer defense groups are particularly helpful in air raids. These defense groups are formed entirely by the voluntary participation of the people and do not include the Philippine police force. Sison also pointed out that air raid shelters are particularly unsuitable in Manila, and the construction of basements is even more impossible because the foundation of the Philippine Islands is very humid and lacks building materials such as steel and cement. Therefore, the best preventive measure is to evacuate to other areas without military targets. Manila will also implement this immediately upon the successful organization of the defense groups. According to the civil defense budget passed by the authorities last year, there is US$1.5 million, but the Philippine authorities still hope that the United States can provide more financial assistance. The civil defense program was actually planned last year, but it was terminated due to a dispute between senior U.S. officials stationed in Manila and the government regarding the responsibility for civil defense. It was not until Washington explicitly expressed support for the Philippine civil defense that it began to proceed. Generally, independent observers believe that although Philippine officials are now engaged in guiding the program, the cooperation of U.S. officials is driven by Washington. President Quezon's lack of energy has also prevented other officials from actively implementing this plan. (United Press, 27th)

### Thailand and Vietnam Peace Treaty to be Signed Soon

Vichy - According to Japanese sources, the peace treaty between France and Thailand will soon be officially signed in Tokyo. However, those responsible here have no knowledge of the signing date.

Japanese Newspaper Severely Criticizes Vietnam

Today's Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun commented, advising the French-controlled Vietnamese authorities to change their attitude and sincerely cooperate with Japan. The newspaper said, "The French Vietnamese authorities are adopting anti-Japanese measures, causing us to doubt their good intentions." The newspaper cited the restrictions imposed on Japanese merchants, who are not allowed to join the Vietnam Importers Association, and said, "This attitude is surprising. French Vietnam has the right to organize such an association, using legality to conceal the obstruction of Japan's peaceful economic progress. But we doubt that there are other reasons and motives behind such actions. The anti-Japanese attitude in Vietnam, near Saigon, is very obvious. Japanese stores have been damaged, and Japanese people have been attacked. French Vietnam has no reason to reject Japan's peaceful proposals. The French anti-Japanese attitude is because Japan has always been generous, leading them to mistakenly believe that Japan is to be pitied." (United Press, 27th)

Hanoi - Foreign news agencies issued a message stating that the French Minister to Thailand, Garreau, has traveled from Hanoi to Bangkok to restore diplomatic relations between France and Thailand. Officials here have recently corrected this, stating that France and Thailand have not severed diplomatic relations, and the French Embassy in Thailand has never closed. Garreau came here only to have contact with the Vietnamese authorities. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

### Dutch East Indies Allows Natives to Serve in the Navy

### Japan to Imitate Germany in Controlling National Life

Tokyo - Matsuoka said in a welcome speech yesterday that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact has not eliminated the country's current difficulties. If possible, from tomorrow onwards, he would like to imitate Germany's method and establish a system to control the lives of the Japanese people. Unfortunately, this system is still just empty talk on paper. Although Germany certainly had a stage of paper planning first, Japan today really does not have this leisurely time. (Reuters, 27th)

### Pan-American Economic Advisory Committee Resolves to Confiscate Foreign Vessels; 160 Foreign Ships Remain in the US; Each Country Can Have the Right to Dispose of Them Inexpensively

Washington - The Economic Advisory Committee, representing the twenty-one American republics, passed a resolution yesterday allowing each country to requisition foreign vessels staying in Western Hemisphere ports. Each country can dispose of these vessels inexpensively. Argentina had previously expressed its unwillingness to confiscate foreign vessels but can now act freely. However, the Argentine representative stated that the country "absolutely agrees" with this resolution. (United Press, 27th)

Washington - The Pan-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee, meeting here, advocated retaining 160 foreign ships stranded in American ports and using them to enhance the peace and security of the American continent.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Welles stated yesterday that this proposal will be immediately submitted to the governments of all relevant countries. (Reuters, 27th)

Washington - The Pan-American Maritime Commission held a meeting here today, chaired by Undersecretary of State Acheson. It unanimously passed a resolution stipulating that the American republics may separately handle foreign vessels anchored in their ports according to their own laws and interests.

### Axis Newspapers Attack the United States

Berlin - German newspapers yesterday strongly attacked President Roosevelt's declaration that the U.S. neutrality patrol would be extended worldwide if necessary, and warned that this move by the U.S. would be tantamount to seeking trouble. They also stated that Germany, Italy, and Japan had all decided to resist Roosevelt's pro-British policy and that the war had not advanced toward the U.S., but Roosevelt was now entering the path of war. (United Press, 27th)

Berlin - The German government dismissed as a joke President Roosevelt's statement that "the Axis powers have occupied part of Greenland, which may happen." (Reuters, 27th)

Rome - The "Rome Daily" wrote an editorial yesterday stating that the U.S. government is thinking of drawing the U.S. into the war. The newspaper commented on the recent speeches by U.S. Secretary of State Hull and U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox, stating that after the British army's defeat in the Balkans, the U.S. government has openly adopted a belligerent attitude towards the Axis powers. (United Press, 27th)

Berlin - The Hamburger Fremdenblatt commented on the U.S. fleet escorting convoys, saying that the appearance of the U.S. flag in the European theater directly harms Germany's interests. Hitler said in his speech on January 30, "Those who unwisely want to help Britain must know this fact: regardless of whether ships have naval escorts, all those within the range of German torpedoes will be sunk by torpedoes." The article stated that the claims of U.S. interventionists only harm the future of the U.S. and do not benefit German-American relations. Germany's goal is to deal with its only enemy, Britain. Germany's policy toward the Western Hemisphere is only to promote legitimate economic interests, and it does not ask about anything else. There is no need for conflict between the German and American nations. Hitler's warning is still in effect, and the entire German nation fully supports it with all its strength. The U.S. interventionists, who are driving U.S. ships into the war zone and inciting the American people's war frenzy, must bear full responsibility for all the consequences.

Batavia - According to wireless telegraphy here, Hungarian residents of the Dutch East Indies have submitted a document to the Dutch East Indies government, declaring their loyalty to the Dutch East Indies. In the past hundred years, no small country has suffered more from Germany's expansionist desires than Hungary. We deeply know who is fighting against modern barbarism and tyranny, and we know that if barbarism wins, the most precious freedoms of thought and speech of mankind will be lost forever. We Hungarians residing in the Dutch East Indies have opposed Nazism since before the outbreak of the European war. We are willing to share common responsibilities in the Dutch East Indies with the qualifications of loyal citizens. (Reuters, 27th)

### Greek War Nearing End; German Troops Entered Athens Yesterday; Greek Commander-in-Chief Resigns; Most British Troops Withdraw to North Africa to Fight

Berlin - The German High Command announced this afternoon that the vanguard of the German army entered Athens at 9:25 this morning. The 卐 flag has been hoisted over the city. It also stated that German paratroopers occupied the Corinth isthmus, Corinth town, and the Corinth Canal yesterday. It also stated that the Führer's bodyguard is advancing rapidly west of the Pindus Mountains, reaching the Bay of Patras, and has crossed the bay and entered the Peloponnese. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

London - The final stage of the Greek war is nearing its end. A team of German motorized bicycle soldiers entered Athens at 9:30 on Sunday morning. At the same time, the 卐 flag was seen flying over the Acropolis. It is heard that the main force of the German army arrived two hours later. The Greek people witnessed the German troops marching in formation, with a rather calm attitude. According to a telegram from Hitler's headquarters received by the German official news agency, the Hitler bodyguard advancing in the Peloponnese, starting west of the Pindus Mountains, has forced its way across the Bay of Patras. German paratroopers are said to have captured the Corinth isthmus, and the city and canal have been occupied. According to a telegram from Athens, General Papagos, the Greek commander-in-chief, has requested to be placed on the retired list. Prime Minister Tsouderos has concurrently assumed the position of Minister of the Army. External personnel Agropoulos has been appointed as the commander of all the Aegean islands. (Reuters, 27th)

Zurich - This station received a broadcast from a German radio station yesterday afternoon, which said, "German troops have occupied the islands of Lemnos, Skyros, and Thasos, etc., and are quite close to the Dardanelles Strait, so the British have completely lost their territorial waters in the eastern Mediterranean Sea." (United Press, 27th)

Athens - Residents of Athens, at 0:10 this morning, quietly awaited the arrival of German troops inside their tightly closed doors and under shattered windows. The evening newspaper urged the people to greet the German troops with a grim smile. Due to the curfew, the people on the streets had disappeared in the evening. The weather was mild last night, and a royal edict was issued in the evening, stating that General Papagos, the commander-in-chief, had requested to resign and was immediately relieved of his duties. The Athens radio station stated that the Ministry of Public Security announced that the damage from German aircraft bombing various places in Attica and the Peloponnese was minor, and there were not many deaths. (United Press, 27th)

London - This station said at 6:00 p.m. yesterday (1:00 a.m. this morning in Shanghai) that although the number and firepower of the British rearguard were far inferior to the German army, they were still strongly defending to cover the withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force from Greece. The German army used air force and 155mm heavy artillery to fiercely bomb and pave the way for the advancing Nazi tank army. The small number of British troops defending Thermopylae was similar to the army of Leonidas in 480 BC, which used a small number to resist the Persian army. When the German vanguard entered the vast countryside, its numbers were far superior to the British army. The German army's offensive route targeted Marathon, Athens, and the Corinth isthmus. This was the only route of escape for the British Expeditionary Force on land. Observers here admitted that the British army could not have a great victory on the Marathon plain like in ancient times, because the German strategy undoubtedly intended to cut off the route of the isthmus as soon as possible, cutting off all land routes. (United Press, 27th)

Athens - The retreating British army fought against the German armored column at Kitheron, between Athens and Thebes (north of Athens) yesterday afternoon. There was also a stubborn rearguard battle at Mount Lamia, which controls the only car road passing through the narrow waist of Corinth and serves as a barrier to the Corinth Canal. The Athens area was bombed by airplanes all day long. The Athens Nea newspaper stated that the British rearguard resisted very stubbornly. The German army, which descended from Thermopylae, suffered extremely heavy losses. The Ethnos newspaper also stated that several locations on the large mountain controlling the Gulf of Corinth are in the hands of the Allied forces, and a major battle will occur in the area of Kyriaki. (United Press, 27th)

London - Last night, Athens radio said that the German troops who had broken through the Thermopylae line were still advancing southeast. The British army in Greece is now only conducting operations to block the enemy's advance, but it can only provide temporary support. Therefore, the purpose of this type of warfare is only to delay time. The British rearguard is now engaged in resistance at various strategic locations, because it will not be without difficulty for the enemy to advance deep into the southeast. (Reuters, 27th)

Istanbul - Greek Cabinet Coordinator Sakellaropoulos issued a letter to the Greek youth on the island of Crete yesterday, stating that the Greek government's withdrawal from the mainland is temporary. Greece will continue to engage in the war on the island of Crete. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

### Reasons for the Surrender of the Greek Army in Epirus: Actually Due to the Disparity in Numbers, Not Due to a Lack of Courage

London - Athens Radio last night broadcast an article from the Greek Ministry of the Army, stating that the surrender of the Greek army in the Epirus region was not due to a lack of courage, but because the Greek army had to confront the armies of two major countries with a combined population of 150 million. Due to the disparity in numbers and the vast difference in advantages and disadvantages, the Greek army fought hard on the Albanian front for six months and won victories repeatedly. Unexpectedly, the southern army retreated, leaving the rear empty, and the enemy then attacked from behind with a numerically stronger army and its mechanized weapons. In this environment, the Greek army had no choice but to retreat 90 miles under continuous air raids, without any protection from anti-aircraft guns. However, during this retreat, not a single person was lost, and the mobilization was well-managed, which will be admired when the details are announced in the future. The transportation lines of the Greek army in Epirus were bombed and cut off, and it could not contact the headquarters or obtain supplies. Moreover, it was attacked by enemy forces from the east and north. It was absolutely impossible to continue fighting. Only then did it surrender. (Reuters, 27th)

### Bulgarian Army Continues to Enter the Macedonia Region; Italian Army Also Occupies Greek Territory and Establishes New Administrative Agencies

Both actions are currently underway, and the Ciamuria region "for strategic and demographic reasons" is also included in this occupied area. According to the Italian official news agency, Italy will send a civil administrator to Montenegro (one of the Southern Countries), and several Italian diplomats stationed in the country have been appointed and will depart for Cetinje, the capital of Montenegro, on Friday night. (Reuters, 27th)

### Turkish Newspaper Publishes Article Advocating Soviet-Turkish Cooperation; German Defense Council Orders the Excavation of a Canal to Control Water Transport from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea

Ankara - A Turkish newspaper published an article yesterday predicting that Germany will make demands on Turkey. It advocates Soviet-Turkish cooperation, saying that Hitler will or will try to find military bases in French and Spanish Africa in order to drive away the British fleet. Although the idea that Germany is putting pressure on Turkey and the Soviet Union is purely conjecture, it is by no means delusional. No one knows what kind of demands the Germans will make on Turkey and the Soviet Union, but many believe that the Germans will have something to say about the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits. This statement by a Turkish newspaper is the first since the outbreak of the European war. (Reuters, 27th)

London - According to the German official news agency, German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, arrived in Berlin on Friday and will stay for a day or two. (Reuters, 27th)

Berlin - The German Defense Council recently issued an order to excavate a canal between the Otter River and the Danube River in order to connect them.

Hungary and Turkey have also launched a trade agreement worth 20 million Turkish pounds, which will be signed in the Hungarian capital within ten days. This is the result of four months of negotiations. Turkey will exchange agricultural products for Hungarian industrial products. The Turkish-Bulgarian trade agreement is even more ideal, with the exchange value reaching 40 million Turkish pounds. This number is the largest among the agreements Turkey has ever signed with Balkan countries, and it is twice as large as the current Turkish-German barter agreement. Turkey will export steel, iron seedlings, cotton, fruits, vegetables, etc. to Bulgaria, and Bulgaria will exchange manufactured goods, such as radio parts. All items will be transported via the Danube River. (United Press, 27th)

### Regardless of West or Far East, Allied Nations Will Eventually Win; Britain Has Created Moral Capital, Will Defeat Hitler with Sea Power; Broadcast Address by South African Prime Minister General Smuts

Cape Town: South African Prime Minister General Smuts gave a broadcast here last night, stating that compared to the fundamental points, the Balkan war is merely a branch of the European war. Although Germany currently has the upper hand, it will ultimately fail. If Britain does not fall and sea power is not lost, then Hitler will ultimately be defeated. Although Hitler has won victories everywhere in Europe, he has not been able to cope with the real key points.

The Balkans Is Not the Decisive Battle

There is one more thing that allows us to look forward to the future with confidence: Hitler's revealed true face and his new order have awakened the United States from its slumber and aroused it to action. He believes that final victory will belong to the Allied nations, not only in the Balkans but also in the West and the Far East. Yugoslavia collapsed shortly after the start of the war. Greece, after a brave defense, was unable to contain a more numerous and powerful enemy, and the British army retreated slightly after being pressed by a formidable foe. People inevitably have doubts about the future of the Allied nations. It should be known that during the last European war, the position of the Allied nations in Europe was even worse than today, but the Allied nations ultimately won. The current war cannot be decided in the Balkans. Britain's willingness to make sacrifices to assist Greece and other small countries is a matter of Britain's honor. Germany inspires hatred, while Britain inspires friendship. Therefore, Britain is now creating a kind of moral capital, and only this can establish a truly new world order after peace is restored. Hitler launched the war, and as an aggressor, he will inevitably continue his aggression until he is exhausted.

Germany Will Eventually Attempt to Invade Britain

Britain is fundamentally on the defensive. If Hitler cannot invade Britain, then he will not achieve his goal and will inevitably fail. Therefore, sooner or later, Hitler will be forced to attempt an invasion of Britain. This is the fundamental point, and everything else is merely a branch. Victory in the Balkans or elsewhere cannot provide Hitler with the ultimate benefit. Even if Hitler destroys all the countries of continental Europe, he will ultimately fail if he cannot defeat Britain. As for Britain's defenses, in order to maintain food and other supplies, the lifeline of transportation must be kept open. This is the route of the North Atlantic and the Cape of Good Hope. As for transportation in the Mediterranean, it is also important, but secondary. These are all Britain's lifelines. Britain may temporarily lose everything else, but if it can defeat the enemy's invasion and keep this lifeline open, it has already defeated Hitler and can restore what was temporarily lost.

Victory Can Be Ensured If the US Joins the War

The results we have achieved in Africa and the Mediterranean are already very important, and the United States has also provided us with assistance through the Lend-Lease Act. However, it is not only this. The relationship between the United States and the Allied nations is becoming closer, and there will soon be major developments. This is what he has long predicted. In his view, only active participation by the United States can ensure victory at an early date. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

London: British Naval Minister's Private Secretary Fletcher gave a speech yesterday in Uxbridge, Buckinghamshire, saying that British sea power will eventually defeat Hitler. The Germans do not know the importance of sea power, and even Hitler himself does not fully understand the meaning of sea power. Since the time of Queen Elizabeth, Britain has repeatedly won major victories, all with sea power as the ultimate tool for victory. This will continue to be the case in the future. The sea power that Britain will ultimately use to defeat Hitler is this sea power. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)

### 60,000 German Troops Concentrated on French-Spanish Border, Preparing to Invade Gibraltar

Budapest: Four divisions of German mechanized troops, totaling 60,000 men, are currently concentrated on the French-Spanish border, preparing to invade Gibraltar. At the same time, they plan to occupy Suez to defeat the British Eastern Mediterranean Fleet. Well-informed sources here predict that the German army will take advantage of its sweeping victories in southern Greece to invade the Mediterranean. It is rumored that the Axis powers plan to use troops from Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to defend southern Greece, so that Axis troops can invade Egypt and approach the Iraqi oil fields through Syria. German motorized reinforcements have been steadily entering Greece since yesterday, after four days of silence. According to reports here, thousands of German and Italian aircraft are now striving to eliminate the remnants of the British Expeditionary Force and are attacking the British fleet with all their strength. (International dispatch on the 27th)

Gibraltar: It was learned yesterday that a large-scale blackout exercise will be held here this week. (United Press dispatch on the 27th)

Axis Focus on Egypt

Observers in Rome recently stated that the Balkan war is only the initial stage of the battle for control of the Mediterranean. This struggle has no possibility of stopping at this time, but it will soon reach a turning point. Although the press and political figures here will remain silent about Turkey's future movements, they will speak freely about the African war, emphasizing that according to the Axis powers' view, Africa is actually the tail end of the European continent. Therefore, after the end of the Balkan war, the Axis powers' focus will be on Egypt, because Egypt is the gateway between the East and the West, and the hub of Africa and Asia. Furthermore, as is generally known here, once the Axis powers have won victory in the Mediterranean, an international conference will be held in Berlin or Vienna to discuss the African issue. All European countries, including non-belligerent countries such as Spain, former belligerent countries such as France, and neutral countries such as Switzerland and Sweden, will be able to send representatives to participate. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)

Stockholm: A dispatch from Berlin in the Social Democratic newspaper here stated that Berlin is currently discussing the situation in Spain and Portugal.

### Portuguese Prime Minister Reiterates Neutral Intent, Will Continue to Send Troops to the Azores

New York: Private sources say that Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar reiterated Portugal's complete neutrality last Monday, because the people of the country are extremely apprehensive due to the rumors spread by the two belligerent countries and need assurance. The Portuguese government has sent troops to the Azores (in the Atlantic Ocean) to protect its sovereignty, and has recently sent additional artillery units. It plans to send another 10,000 men, mostly infantry and artillery, and officers and doctors have been ordered to serve on the island for four years. (United Press dispatch on the 27th)

### Swedish Newspaper Comments on the Situation, Italian Combat Power Is Weak, Greece Is Glorious Even in Defeat

Sweden: A newspaper here reported that Italy alone could not conquer weak Greece. When Germany launched its attack, the final outcome was already decided. However, even in the final stage, Greece's reputation will remain glorious. A naval correspondent for a certain newspaper discussed the situation in North Africa, saying that if the British Navy blocks German-Italian maritime traffic in the Mediterranean, it will not only provide active assistance to the defense of Egypt, but will also eventually isolate the French, Italian, and German land forces, forcing them to retreat and unable to attack the Suez Canal. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

### German Correspondent Reports on Statistics of Sinking British Ships

Berlin: According to Lieutenant General Pfeiffer, a naval correspondent for Haitong News Agency, as the British army withdrew from Greece to Crete and Egypt, German and Italian aircraft bombed transport ships, sinking 34 ships, totaling 180,000 tons, including three oil tankers and many ships full of troops. They also destroyed one patrol boat and one small warship. In total, the ships destroyed included one British cruiser, one battleship, three destroyers, one warship, one submarine, two auxiliary cruisers, and 67 merchant ships, totaling 190,000 tons. German submarines, near Britain, attacked convoys and sank three enemy ships, totaling 14,000 tons, and sank the 16,000-ton auxiliary cruiser "Rajputana" and two merchant ships in the Atlantic. German submarines have changed their area of operations, so fewer ships have been sunk. German submarine aces Kretschmer and Schepke's submarines have been lost, which is deeply regrettable. They received the highest honor for German soldiers, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. Kretschmer and part of his crew have been rescued. Schepke went down with his submarine. Kretschmer had sunk three British destroyers, three auxiliary cruisers, and other ships, totaling 316,000 tons. Schepke sank 233,970 tons.

### America's Financial Problems and Measures

— Zhou Jin

This article was originally written by Mr. Zhou Jin, Secretary of the Business School of Shanghai University, at the request of the China National Economic Research Institute, for the foreign section of the third continued edition of the "China and Foreign Economic Yearbook" of the institute. The full text is divided into sections such as finance, industry, and trade, and it offers many unique insights into the current economic trends in the United States. Its detailed description is an added bonus. At the beginning of the Sino-American monetary cooperation, the current state of American finance will surely be welcomed by readers. With the consent of the author and the institute, we are publishing the finance section first, so that readers can have a quick look. Special note to thank the author and the institute. — Editor

In the American financial world of 1940, there are several points to note! First, the national banking industry is showing signs of improvement; second, there is a panic of inflation following the outbreak of war; third, the surplus of gold has become a more serious problem; and fourth, measures to freeze foreign assets have been taken to prevent Germany from seizing funds from occupied countries. These four items will now be described separately.

(1) The Calm Scene of the Banking Industry In general, the American banking industry still showed signs of improvement last year; but if analyzed carefully, there are inevitably various difficulties and pains. First, the number of banks is less than in previous years, but this is due to the large number of bank closures at the end of the previous year, and not because the banking industry was sluggish last year. On the contrary, the number of bank closures last year was less than in any previous year, which also suggests that the banking industry did not have any major difficulties. The following is a table of the number of operating banks and closed banks in the past three years:

(A) Statistics of Operating Banks

(B) Statistics of Closed Banks

(Note) The number of banks listed in the table are those that have temporarily or permanently closed due to financial difficulties. If all debts have been recognized by other banks at the time of closure, they are not included. As for the amount of deposits, for member banks and insured non-member banks, the data is based on the day of closure, and for uninsured non-member banks, the data is based on the latest information available when the closure report is received.

Looking at the reserves of the banks, the actual amount generally exceeds the required amount by a large margin (see the table below). This is naturally a sign of consolidation for the banks themselves, but it inevitably raises concerns about credit expansion for the society, because ordinary commercial banks can lend three dollars and fifty cents for every dollar of reserves. Since reserves are excessive, there is naturally the possibility of credit expansion.

Reserves of Member Banks in Federal Reserve Banks in December 1940

Finally, in terms of business, the amount of deposits, loans and investments of each bank has increased, but the rate of increase in deposits is greater than the rate of increase in loans and other investments, resulting in excess reserves becoming a more serious problem. All banks are troubled by the increase in deposits and the lack of ways to use them, resulting in bank interest rates falling to the lowest point in history.

Table of Deposits, Loans and Investments of All Banks

(2) The Problem of Inflation Because of the sharp increase in national defense spending and the increasing deficit in the national treasury, and because of the sharp rise in prices following the outbreak of World War II, Americans are worried about the crisis of inflation. However, according to experts, this crisis is not difficult to eliminate.

First, let's examine the national treasury deficit. According to the views of a group of American financiers, the government's method of increasing the money supply, either by issuing banknotes or by selling government bonds to the Federal Reserve Banks or commercial banks, may seem alarming at first glance, but in reality it is often limited by the amount by which government expenditures exceed revenues. Moreover, referring to past examples, the increase in the total amount of currency is often smaller than the amount of the government deficit. The way to make up for it is not necessarily to issue banknotes or sell government bonds to banks, but to sell government bonds to the public, which can avoid the impact of inflation. The current currency in the United States is 65 billion yuan. If the government deficit is only within 5 billion yuan, it will definitely not lead to inflation. It will not be until it reaches more than 10 billion yuan that there will be such fears. According to the US government budget for the past three years, the deficit has increased from 3.6 billion yuan in 1939-40 to 6.2 billion yuan in 1940-41 and 9.2 billion yuan in 1941-42. If it continues to increase in the future, the problem of inflation may also increase in its seriousness.

Next, let's examine the rise in prices. When the European war broke out in the fall of 1939, the prices of various major commodities suddenly soared. This was entirely the result of speculation, so it was very temporary and prices fell again. However, in the last two months of last year, there was a slight upward trend again. However, because of the cooperation between the government and the people, the United States can increase the supply of goods and prevent prices from rising too much. At present, the US Department of the Treasury has a large number of products, including unguaranteed loans released by the Commodity Credit Corporation, including 9.5 million bales of cotton, 500 million bushels of grain, 100 million bushels of wheat, and many other items; it also has a large amount of oils and fats from the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation. In the future, if inflation occurs, these goods can be used to lower prices. Moreover, for the sake of establishing Pan-American economic defense, the United States is trying its best to purchase special products from South American countries, such as oil, wheat, coffee, cotton, etc. These things have no market in the United States. Now that they are stored, they can also be used to curb inflation in the future. In addition, the US government's power to control prices was effectively used during the last war, and there is a strong tendency to reuse it this time. Therefore, the problem of inflation may be resolved peacefully through the above-mentioned measures.

(3) The Problem of Gold Surplus In the past five or six years, gold has continuously flowed into the United States from all over the world, making the United States hold more than 70% of the world's existing gold, which has caused various concerns about the gold surplus. This can be said to be a strange phenomenon in the economic world. There are many reasons for the gold surplus in the United States. Generally speaking, the devaluation of the pound in 1931 and the devaluation of the dollar in 1934 were enough to encourage gold production. The outbreak of wars in Europe and Asia has made Japan and European countries want to exchange their gold for military supplies or seek safe storage, and they have deeply transferred it to the United States. In addition, the recovery of US overseas investments and the payment of international trade surpluses also make gold flow into the United States. The following table shows the changes in US gold reserves.

Table of US Gold Reserves and Gold Import Values in the Past Seven Years

(Note 1) Calculated at a gold price of 20.67 yuan per ounce in January 1934, and 35 yuan per ounce thereafter.

(Note 2) Includes gold in bad debts, valued at 27,000,000 yuan at the end of 1936 and 1,228,000,000 yuan at the end of 1937.

Estimated number

From the above table, we can see that gold flowed into the United States the most in the last two times. According to the report of the US Federal Reserve Board, after the outbreak of the European War, the value of gold flowing into the United States was greater than any previous period. From the end of August 1939 to the end of 1940, its imports were 5.8 billion yuan. Of this, approximately 700 million yuan is still designated by the Federal Reserve Bank as belonging to the governments or central banks of exporting countries, and the remainder has increased to the US gold reserves. Therefore, the value of gold reserves, including domestic gold production, increased by 5.3 billion yuan during the war, reaching 22 billion yuan by the end of 1940.

The main concerns caused by excessive gold are two: first, it is feared that excessive reserves will cause credit expansion, causing changes in prices and living expenses; second, it is feared that Germany will win the war and permanently abolish gold as a monetary standard, causing gold to lose its value. Regarding these two points, the former already has this trend. Fortunately, the United States has abundant domestic industrial raw materials and food, and the government and the people know the importance of maintaining market responsibilities, which may avoid adverse consequences. As for the latter, it is generally believed that gold is the best monetary material and will never be permanently abandoned, and after the war, European countries will inevitably withdraw their funds to seek recovery, so gold will be able to regain its importance. However, different people have different opinions, and each has its own reasons.

There are many suggestions for solving the "gold disaster", such as stopping the purchase of all gold, lowering gold prices or taxing to limit the inflow of gold, signing international agreements to reduce gold production, abolishing private restrictions on gold, restoring gold coin circulation, increasing the legal reserve ratio of bank deposits, exporting gold to foreign goods, etc., but there is no fixed countermeasure. How it will change in the future, we can only wait and see.

(4) Implementation of Freezing Foreign Assets After Germany and Poland started the war in September 1939, many small and weak European countries were partially or completely occupied by Germany. In order to curb the Axis powers and protect democratic countries, President Roosevelt, based on the provisions of the US War Act promulgated on October 6, 1917, that the president has the power to order the prohibition of domestic funds from flowing abroad, starting in April last year, successively froze the funds of several countries occupied by Germany in the United States, to prevent them from being seized by Germany. The start dates of the freezing of each country and the amount of frozen funds are listed below: (Unit: million US dollars)

Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia were occupied by Soviet Russia in May 1940.

In addition to those listed in the table above, it is rumored that the United States has also approved the freezing of the funds of the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan in the United States. According to a Washington dispatch from the United Press on February 4 this year, it is estimated that German deposits in the United States are US$113,000,000, and Italian deposits in the United States are US$82,000,000, totaling nearly US$200 million. Recently, it has also been rumored that after Congress passes the Aid to Democratic Countries Act, Roosevelt will continue to freeze the funds of the United Kingdom, Greece, China, and Central and South American countries in the United States. However, the US freezing of the funds of Norway, Belgium, etc. is all to prevent the funds of the above-mentioned countries from being seized by Germany and Italy, or from using methods to obtain US or third-country materials to maintain their war of aggression, so the freezing is very strict; as for wanting to freeze the funds of democratic countries, although it is also to prevent the crisis of being used by the Axis powers, after the freezing, if the democratic countries need to use them, they can still apply to the US Department of the Treasury for withdrawal permits after reviewing the source and use of the funds, so the two are very different.

### Seen, Heard, Thought

Prosperity inside barbed wire relies on two kinds of fertilizer: one is the skeletons of those who died heroically on the battlefield; the other is the skeletons of those who starved to death on the road.

However: Prosperity inside barbed wire also has two major contributions: one is to create a large number of new troops for the Communist Party; the other is to create another group of new comrades for the anti-Communist faction.

### China's Economic Strategy

— Li Zongming

"Continuing the Economic Construction of Free China"

According to Dr. Gong Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs of China, the Chinese government's economic blockade against Japan has been remarkably effective due to the implementation of the following three measures:

(1) In order to defeat the Japanese policy of "using war to support war", the Chinese government first promulgated the Regulations on the Prohibition of the Transportation of Local Products in August 1939, prohibiting the transportation of materials into the occupied areas. These materials include two categories: one is raw materials for manufacturing munitions, such as cotton, coal, salt, and metal ores; the other is goods that the Japanese can export to exchange for foreign exchange, such as leather, wool, pig bristles, and soybeans. After that, the government also issued a general order to the political, military, and customs authorities at all levels to prohibit the smuggling of more than 60 kinds of materials into the occupied areas, and set up water offices to be responsible for investigation. In addition, in order to actively prevent all resources from being used by the Japanese, on the one hand, the government ordered the International Trade Commission and the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau to purchase materials from various places as much as possible for export, military, or daily use by the people; on the other hand, the government advised the people in the occupied areas to change their production businesses or reduce production, only seeking to meet their consumption needs. In 1938, the goods transported from the occupied areas to Japan were worth 116,000,000 yuan, which had been reduced to 66,000,000 yuan by 1939. How effective it is! It goes without saying!

(2) In order to eradicate smuggling, the government promulgated laws to resist the entry of various goods manufactured by Japan and its colonies: this law also applies to factories opened by the Japanese in the occupied areas and Chinese factories under Japanese control. This measure makes it impossible for the Japanese to obtain Chinese legal tender and other materials at will. However, our government authorities do not neglect the issue of supplying the general necessities of the people in the country, and therefore vigorously encourage and promote various small crafts and small industries. Moreover, the above-mentioned boycott of Japanese goods is not limited to the country; it is also strictly implemented among the 100 million overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world; other peace-loving countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, India, and Australia, are also inspired by justice and launched a movement to boycott Japanese goods, which is even more exciting.

(3) Launching a wide range of guerrilla warfare to engage in economic sabotage in the occupied areas, the Japanese imported 310,000,000 yuan of goods into the occupied areas in 1939, which is quite alarming compared to 150,000,000 yuan in 1937 and 200,000,000 yuan in 1938! However, the increase in Japanese exports to the occupied areas cannot be immediately regarded as a blessing for the Japanese. Under the current circumstances, after Japanese goods are imported into the occupied areas, the income is military tickets and foreign exchange, but the raw materials used to manufacture the goods themselves must be purchased from abroad with foreign exchange. Therefore, the increase in Japanese exports to the occupied areas today is tantamount to investing foreign exchange in China. Unless the order in the occupied areas is restored and Chinese raw materials are supplied to meet the needs of Japan, so that its industrial exports can rotate continuously, there will be little chance of benefit to it in the end.

### A Few Words on Controlled Economy

— Yan Maode

Let me first explain three terms: (1) Syndicalism, hoping to produce an ideal organization of an economic alliance, and to reconcile the industrial councils organized by various industries, so that this organization can achieve stability. (2) Guild Socialism, which hopes that the national industry will have a centralized organization, so that the position of production and the position of consumption can be on a unified position. (3) The World Workers' Association is to form a control over the activities of each sector of the world industry, and then unite each sector. This united organization is used to replace each sector. As for the goals of these three, they are: (1) to put the social economic organization on a new ideal and to oppose the old organization. (2) In contrast to the above-mentioned idea is conservatism. Conservatism does not want to overthrow this system, because conservatism has a close relationship with democracy. Under conservatism, economic interests are controlled by Congress, until economic shortcomings occur, so social reformers use regional election councils to participate in professional elections. In Germany, there was Bismarck's proposal that Congress should participate in this kind of council. He hoped that the social insurance law could be passed in Congress. Through his efforts, a professional election representative was formed later. The same result occurred in Italy, from which it can be seen that Bismarck was also a conservative. (3) The so-called other ways represent the organization of the country, but this kind of thinking is created by the thinkers of the anti-government parties in various countries. They often attack the shortcomings of the parliamentary system, criticize the incompetence of democracy, and believe that it should be controlled by professional groups. In actual life, the above three ideas can be said to have created the source of the idea of controlled economy.

The emergence of controlled economy is different in each country, so the organization and the power of the organization are naturally different. Looking at the similarities in the organization of each country, the organization adopts a committee system. The members are citizens of the country, and most of them belong to the leaders of professional groups. There are 48 people in the Economic Council in France, 326 people in Germany, and other countries are unequal. The term of office is from two to six years. Their production can be divided into four types: (1) freely elected by professional groups to form, (2) nominated by professional groups and then appointed by the government, (3) composed of relevant professional representatives or experts appointed by the government, (4) composed of relevant administrative personnel appointed by the government. The nature of its organization can be divided into three types: (1) planning and execution agency, the Soviet Union does not have the power to plan, but has the power to control the national industry. (2) Representative advisory body, which is composed of the whole country and can help the government to promote the policy of controlled economy. (3) Appointed advisory body, composed of experts selected by the government.

### The Four Banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture Will Resume Business This Morning. The Police Authorities Will Provide Solid Protection, and the Financial Situation of Shanghai Will Become More Stable.

The Shanghai branches and sub-branches of the Central, China, Communications, and China Minsheng Banks and the retreating banks in the war zone have temporarily suspended business since April 17. After the head office telegraphed to resume business immediately to maintain the financial situation, each bank prepared to resume business and discussed protection measures with the concession authorities. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter learned from the four banks yesterday that the arrangements for defense and preparations have been completed, and they are preparing to announce the resumption of business today (Monday). All bills and notes during the suspension period will be collected and cleared on the day of resumption of business. At the same time, the bank bill exchange will resume the exchange of bills from the four banks on the same day. The employees of the four banks, in view of the importance of their responsibilities, have all agreed to continue to serve the society. The concession authorities have sent Chinese and Western detectives and business groups to be stationed in each bank and office to provide solid protection and open for business.

The end of April can be safely passed.

Since the Shanghai branches of the four banks decided to resume business today, the entire financial situation in Shanghai has become more stable, the speculative market has been completely silent, and people's hearts are at peace. The rumors that the four banks had withdrawn and the employees had resigned have been proven by facts to be completely untrue. Due to the resumption of business by the four banks and the stabilization of the financial situation, all industries will be able to safely pass the end of April. Recently, as the end of April approaches, each industry has separately contacted each bank and village to negotiate for an extension or return of the funds due at the end of April, and to negotiate for new long-term credit funds. It is said that these long-term credit funds will be finalized on April 30.

The Equalization Fund is Becoming More Abundant

Since the signing and establishment of the Sino-American and Sino-British Equalization Fund loans, a total of US$50 million from the United States and £5 million from the United Kingdom have been transferred to the Equalization Foreign Exchange Fund Committee for equalization purposes. In addition, the China National Bank has also increased US$10 million, so the equalization fund is becoming more abundant, which is sufficient to stabilize the legal foreign exchange, consolidate the currency credit, and maintain the debt reputation. For the sake of protecting the legitimate business operations of friendly countries and merchants engaged in trade with China, the Shanghai black market foreign exchange will continue to maintain it at any time according to the needs of the market to ensure its lasting stability.

The Central Shanghai Bank Resumes Listing

The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank is preparing to resume the announcement of the legal exchange rate and equalization tax rate at 10:00 am every day today. It is said that the legal exchange rate will remain unchanged, that is, the British exchange rate will be one first and two pence and a half, the US exchange rate will be 30 US dollars, the French exchange rate will be 1080 francs, the German exchange rate will be 75 marks, and the Hong Kong exchange rate will be 95 Hong Kong dollars. The import of all necessities that have been approved by the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee may apply for legal foreign exchange according to law. Regarding the black market foreign exchange, it shall be based on the listing of the HSBC Bank. Legitimate merchants shall be supplied as much as possible.

### Youth Day Various Circles are Preparing to Celebrate

May 4 is the Student Movement Memorial Day and has been designated by the Central Government as China Youth Day. All sectors of the city's population recall the spirit of the youth and students at that time, under the power of the Northern Warlords, launching a bright and unyielding spirit to oppose the unreasonable demands of the Twenty-One Demands, fully demonstrating the sincere and enthusiastic psychology of protecting the country and the nation. Therefore, there was the May Fourth Movement of the Republic of China, and the National Revolution was able to progress smoothly and obtain the fruits of the completion of the Northern Expedition. At the time of the War of Resistance and National Construction, we should make redoubled efforts to promote the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, concentrate our will and strength, unite consistently under the established national policy of the Central Government, so we are actively preparing for a warm celebration to promote the perseverance of Chinese youth and strive for victory in the War of Resistance and National Construction.

### Rice Price Limits to be Abolished - Rice Merchants' Attitudes

The rice merchant trade in this city, due to rice prices exceeding the set limits, with the black market premiums rising steadily, buying expensively and selling cheaply, making it impossible to sustain operations, had petitioned the rice merchant guild, imploring the authorities for relief. Simultaneously, they decided to voluntarily suspend market transactions temporarily and sent a written request to the rice merchant guild to forward to the authorities, urging strict adherence to price limits and complete elimination of black market premiums. The guild has already forwarded the request to the authorities of the two concessions, seeking instructions on how to proceed. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, more than two hundred rice merchant representatives gathered again at the guild to discuss solutions. They all agreed that although they had not entered the market to buy goods, newspaper reports indicated that black market rice prices were still rising. As direct sales outlets to retail stores catering to consumers, the complete abstention from market purchases by the rice merchants has not only failed to lower prices, but instead, the black market premiums have increased. The crux of the problem is self-evident. The representatives present voiced their opinions one after another and decided to continue the temporary suspension of market entry, awaiting instructions from the authorities to comply with. However, according to sources from the authorities, the banks will resume operations today, and the national and foreign rice price limits set on the 17th of this month will be implicitly abolished.

The Scenario of Manipulating Rice Prices Becomes More Obvious

According to those familiar with the rice market, the continued rise in rice prices in the city is purely due to the insistence of larger rice firms to hoard goods. These firms import rice from overseas at quite low costs, but repeatedly seize opportunities to raise prices and seek profits. Therefore, the entire food supply for the city's residents has reached the current state. The committee members of the bean, rice, and miscellaneous grains industries cannot escape blame. As an example, the authorities recently, with good intentions, urged the aforementioned two trade associations to cooperate with the authorities in purchasing low-priced rice supplied by the Hong Kong government. Unexpectedly, the committee members of the two associations refused outright, arguing that purchasing this rice would not only offer no substantial profits but also affect the future price limits on their vast stockpiles of rice. This reveals the intentions of these individuals. It is hoped that the authorities will impose strict sanctions.

### War Situation in Eastern Zhejiang

According to information obtained by the Datong News Agency reporter from Zhejiang organizations in Shanghai: (1) The Chinese troops in Ningbo have now repositioned to defend the area around Wangchun Bridge outside the West Gate, while the Japanese troops are besieged within the city, with both sides in a standoff. (2) The Japanese troops who invaded Shaoxing continued to reach Dongguan but have made no progress due to being blocked by the Cao'e River. (3) Chinese troops rushed to counterattack and recaptured Linhai on the 25th, and are now advancing towards Huangyan. (4) Intermittent fierce battles are still taking place in the suburbs of Wenzhou. (5) Foreign ships in this city have temporarily suspended sailings, and the rumors of resumption of sailings are inaccurate.

### Fare Increases - French Concession Buses Implemented Yesterday - Rickshaw Fares to Increase

Public buses and trolleybuses on various routes in the French Concession have increased fares several times since the war. Now, another round of fare increases has been implemented, with ordinary fares increasing by 2 to 6 cents per stop. The minimum fare has increased from 4 cents to 6 cents, further increasing the burden on ordinary residents. Everyone sincerely hopes that the company can actively reorganize its operations, increase company revenue, and reduce the burden on passengers. The rickshaw industry association in this city believes that the prices of metal parts and car materials have soared several times compared to this time last year. The current rickshaw fares are restricted by the Municipal Council, making it difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, they have been discussing solutions for days. The consensus is that other rental cars, moving trucks, rental bicycles, public buses, trolleybuses, etc., have repeatedly raised prices automatically because they are not restricted by the authorities. This industry faces the same situation as the above-mentioned industries but cannot sustain the losses. Therefore, it has been decided to report the prices of various materials and the general situation to the Municipal Council for a review of rickshaw fares, appropriately increasing them to maintain operations.

### Garbage Workers in the French Concession Striked Yesterday Morning

Approximately 700 garbage collection workers employed by the Sanitation Department of the French Municipal Council recently demanded increases in wages and rice subsidies, along with more than ten other demands, due to the continuous rise in the price of rice and daily necessities in Shanghai, and their wages being insufficient to sustain their livelihoods. Because these demands were not met, they went on strike together at 1:00 AM yesterday morning. Upon receiving the news, the authorities immediately hired White Russian workers as replacements. Meanwhile, the police department dispatched patrol officers to maintain order, assigning one Chinese officer to each garbage truck to provide protection during operation and prevent incidents. Furthermore, it is reported that dozens of temporary workers among these workers had requested a wage increase. The authorities refused, arguing that temporary workers could not be compared to permanent workers, leading to the strike. Because yesterday was a Sunday holiday, negotiations have not yet begun. It is reported that the workers have already selected representatives and prepared a written statement to present to the authorities today to discuss the matter.

### Total Solar Eclipse This Autumn - Time of Initial Eclipse

### Detained Southern Vessel to be Released - Italian Troops to be Withdrawn - Italian Response to Customs Protest Imminent - Port Authorities Deploy Marine Police on Board

According to the Times newspaper, the Yugoslavian freighter "Toni Slav" has been detained by Italian sailors for the fifth day as of yesterday (the 26th), but there is hope that the vessel will be released soon. Although a response has not yet been received to the protest lodged by the Jianghai Customs Port Authority with the Italian Consulate General, the Italian side has informed Jianghai Customs that it acknowledges receipt of the protest and claims a response will be issued shortly. The condemnation of this incident by a Japanese naval spokesperson on Friday (the 25th) is sufficient indication that this matter should be concluded soon. At that time, the Italian troops will be withdrawn. Meanwhile, maritime police from the Port Authority and Italian sailors from the "Liban" gunboat remain stationed on the "Toni Slav," and there has been no friction between the two parties.

### Over 30,000 Visited the Lone Army Barracks Yesterday to Pay Respects - All Circles to Hold Memorial Service on the 3rd of Next Month

Yesterday was the third day after the assassination of General Xie Jinyuan, commander of the Lone Army Regiment. Telegrams of condolence from all sectors of the country poured in endlessly. Yesterday, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, also sent a special telegram of condolence. People from all walks of life in this city, inspired by General Xie's heroic and unyielding spirit, went to the Lone Army Barracks to pay their respects. The number of visitors reached over 30,000. The mourning hall was filled to bursting, and the atmosphere was solemn. The police authorities specially dispatched a large number of detectives to maintain traffic. As for the date of General Xie's funeral, it has not yet been finalized, but the Shanghai memorial service has been set for 10:00 AM on the 3rd of next month (to be held on the same day as the military celebration and memorial service). At that time, the procession of plain carriages and white horses will be a sight to behold. Details are recorded as follows:

Vice President Kong Sends Telegram of Condolence

Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the National Government's Executive Yuan, sent a telegram of condolence to the Lone Army Barracks yesterday. The telegram read: "To the family of Commander Xie Jinyuan, I have been informed of the shocking news of Commander Xie's assassination. I am deeply grieved. For three years, under the leadership of Commander Xie, our hundreds of lone soldiers have been brave and unyielding, enduring great hardships. Their loyalty and integrity are as bright as the sun and moon. It is unfortunate that they were betrayed, and we have lost such a fine officer. However, their righteousness will endure, and their spirit will never die. The nation will honor their virtue and reward their merits, and there will be posthumous honors. I send this telegram of condolence, hoping you will grieve less. Kong Xiangxi"

The Public Comes to Pay Respects in an Endless Stream

Yesterday, people from all walks of life in this city went to the Lone Army Barracks to pay their respects. Because it was Sunday, the number of people was too crowded. In order to maintain order, the police authorities stationed two red patrol cars outside the gate of the Lone Army Barracks and closed off traffic on Haifang Road, Singapore Road, and Jiaozhou Road. By 3:00 PM, the number of people had continued to increase. The police only allowed those holding elegiac couplets and other sacrificial items to enter the barracks. Everyone else was prohibited. It was not until 5:00 PM that mourners were allowed to enter the barracks in an orderly line. The total number of visitors throughout the day reached over 30,000, mostly young students and workers. After viewing the remains of the commander, they all showed sorrow, and some even burst into tears.

Major Shangguan's Injury Is Steadily Improving

Yesterday, the reporter again visited Major Lei, who is acting as head of the regiment, to inquire about the condition of Major Shangguan Zhibiao, who was injured. He said that Major Shangguan's condition has greatly improved, but the injuries to his waist and back are more serious and require several days of rest before he can be discharged from the hospital. He continued that all the brothers in the camp, since the assassination of Commander Xie, have felt as if they had lost their parents. All regimental affairs are still being handled in accordance with Commander Xie's wishes. The workshops, which Commander Xie painstakingly established, will continue to operate. The memorial service for Commander Xie is scheduled to be held at 0:00 AM on the 3rd of next month (May).

Condolences and Donations are Very Enthusiastic

Yesterday, the number of wreaths sent by various circles reached more than 100, there were 120 elegiac couplets, and ten silver shields. A brief record of the content of the elegiac couplets is as follows: (1) All Chinese police officers in the Public Concession mourned, "Fought bravely in the Four Banks Warehouse, a hero of the world, his name will be remembered forever. The national crisis has not been resolved, but he was harmed first, and all sides mourn together." The Shanghai Education Association mourned, "His spirit will never die." All members of the Gordon Road Police Station mourned, "His achievements were unyielding." The vendors on Seymour Road mourned, "Though dead, he lives on." The Qingyi Drama Society mourned, "He gave his all to serve the country." It was also learned that a Mr. Wang came to the camp at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning and asked the soldiers in the camp, claiming that if there was a shortage of funds for Commander Xie's funeral, he was willing to take on the task of raising funds. The officers in the camp, touched by his sincerity, accepted a total of 500 yuan to be used for Commander Xie's funeral expenses.

A Brief Biography of Xie Jinyuan's Outstanding Military Achievements

A brief biography of Xie Jinyuan, commander of the Lone Army Regiment of the Four Banks, is recorded as follows: Xie Jinyuan, courtesy name Zhongmin, was from Jiaoling, Guangdong. He was born on April 26th, seven years before the founding of the Republic of China. His father, Fa Yao, and mother, Li, are both still alive. His wife, Ms. Yang Gang, was a graduate of the first class of Southeast Women's School in Shanghai. They married in 1929 and had two daughters and two sons. The eldest daughter, Lingfen, is 12 years old, the second daughter, Lanfen, is 10 years old, the eldest son, Renmin, is 8 years old, and the second son, Jimin, is 6 years old. Xie once studied at National Sun Yat-sen University. In December 1925, he entered the 4th class of the infantry department of the Whampoa Military Academy. After graduating, he graduated from the second class of the Lushan Military Officer Training Corps in September 1934. Since 1926, Xie has served as a platoon leader, company commander, battalion commander, staff officer, director, and regimental adjutant.

### Robbery of Vietnamese Policeman's Gun - Offender Dies

At 7:00 AM on the 25th of this month, a No. 158 Vietnamese policeman from the Zhabei French Concession Police Station was on duty inside the iron gate of Xingsheng Street and Minguo Road when suddenly two fierce robbers wearing short clothes, one wielding a handgun, threatened the Vietnamese policeman to rob him of the service handgun he was carrying. The robbers turned around and fled from the Lane of the Great River, headed to Tianzhu Tang Street and then north to Fa Da Road, turning east towards the Bund of East Huangpu to run. The Vietnamese policeman who lost his gun chased closely behind, shouting wildly. When the two robbers fled to the front of No. 25 Fa Da Road, the patrol officers stationed in front of the French Consulate heard the alarm and helped with the pursuit. One of the two robbers actually took out a gun to resist arrest. The patrol officers also drew their guns and returned fire. The two sides exchanged about ten shots. The robber who resisted arrest was shot twice, collapsed to the ground, and was captured. The injuries were to the right rib and the upper left breast. The patrol officers immediately seized the handgun he was holding, but the robber who had robbed the gun had already escaped without a trace. The injured robber and the stolen gun were taken back to the police station and then sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the injured robber's name was Wang Guanqing, 31 years old, a Shanghai native living at No. 121 Danfeng Road, West Gate.

### Hotel Teahouse Workers Fight at Guide Service Company - Both Sides Injured - Dispute over Commission - Results in Injuries on Both Sides

At 7:30 yesterday morning, a group of teahouse workers from the Huangong Hotel on Zhejiang Road went to the Xinchun Guide Service Company at No. 647 Cide Lane, Guangnei Road, and started a fight. As a result, both sides were injured. Details obtained by the reporter from the News Agency are recorded separately below:

Dispute over Commission Ends Unhappily

The incident stemmed from the fact that several guests in room 215 of the Huangong Hotel at No. 12, Lane 137, Zhejiang Road, were chatting with friends in room 423 of the Wugong Hotel on Fujian Road. They requested that a guide girl from the Xinchun Guide Service Company, Nan Rong (18 years old), accompany them. At around 10:00 PM that night, the guests returned to the Huangong Hotel and took the guide girl with them. It was not until 6:00 AM yesterday morning that they allowed the girl to return to the company. Before leaving, the guests paid her ten yuan for eight hours of service. The girl then paid the teahouse worker a commission of two yuan and four jiao (calculated at three jiao per hour), but the teahouse worker intended to deduct a commission of three yuan. However, the girl had already paid the teahouse worker at the Wugong Hotel six jiao when she went out, so she could not pay more and insisted that it was impossible. The two sides parted unhappily.

Teahouse Workers Go to Demand Justice and Start a Fight

Unexpectedly, the head of the Huangong Teahouse, Xing Lifu, Wu Jiakang, and the teahouse worker Ding Chunlai, after discussing the matter, believed that this precedent could not be set. Therefore, at around 7:00 AM, they gathered more than ten teahouse workers from the entire hotel and rushed to Xinchun to demand justice. They went straight to the dormitory of the girls on the second floor, with a fierce momentum. At this time, there were six guide girls, including Meng Lijun and Xiao Linglong, sleeping in the dormitory, all of whom were awakened from their dreams. They shouted loudly. At the same time, the company's accountant, Feng Lansheng, the teahouse worker, Wan Hongsheng, and five other people rushed to stop them. The two sides went from arguing to fighting, and a brawl broke out. As a result, the police station received a report and rushed to the scene, arresting both sides. During the brawl, five people were injured, including Huangong teahouse workers Wu Jiakang (29 years old) from Jiangbei, Xing Lifu (24 years old), Wan Hongzhong (26 years old, local), and Xinchun's local accountant Feng Lansheng (20 years old), and Wang Chunlai (22 years old). They were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Yu Gong Antique Shop Robbery Case - Two Suspects Adjudicated and Awaiting Sentencing

They were handed over to the First Special Court to apply for a change of date in accordance with the law. During the change of date, the defendant admitted that on February 20 of this year, he and his accomplices robbed the Yu Gong Antique Shop on Jiaotong Road and accompanied the police officers to retrieve more than ten pieces of antiques valued at 50,000 yuan.

### Ticket Takers Return to Work in Four Cinemas

The ticket takers at the four cinemas in this city, including Daguanming, Da Shanghai, Lido, and Cathay, went on strike the day before yesterday. After persuasion, they all returned to work at noon yesterday. It is said that the reason for the strike was not to increase wages, but because Daguanming discovered untorn ticket stubs being thrown into the waste ticket box. It is said that this was done by a certain ticket taker, implicating more than a dozen people, which aroused the response of other ticket takers to strike.

### Coastal Lighthouses and Lightships Have Been Slightly Repaired

### Remembering General Xie Jinyuan

— Ji Ze

General Xie Jinyuan, whose loyal and courageous battle record was admired by people all over the world, has now been murdered while harboring ambitions of seeking reward. Although his eyes are closed, we can still see the brilliance shining from them; although his mouth has stopped speaking, his resolute and heroic speeches still echo in our ears; although we can no longer see his heroic figure on horseback, we can clearly see him still waving his command sword. We will always believe that he was murdered—he will forever be among us, leading us.

Coming out of the Lone Army Camp, rubbing my tearful eyes, I looked up at the sky, which was wearing a mourning face. I returned home with a heavy heart.

Under the glass on my desk, there is a full-body photo of him that I took myself three years ago.

In the summer of 1938, I was studying journalism. Under the guidance of our professor, more than thirty of us students collectively visited the Four Banks Warehouse defenders. In a simply furnished small reception room, General Xie Jinyuan warmly received us. We surrounded him, and he, wearing a white shirt, enthusiastically answered the questions of our classmates. His resolute and powerful Cantonese Mandarin easily touched our hearts. After we finished talking, I asked him to allow me to take a photo, and he readily agreed. I took the general's full-body photo outside the reception room. Who knew that it would now become his posthumous portrait! He was unfortunately murdered and will never rise again.

My second visit to the general was on the Double Tenth Festival of the same year. Before the Double Tenth Festival, the Lone Army Camp had a dispute over the flag-raising issue during the anniversary, which unfortunately led to a bloody incident involving the White Russian troops stationed there. The general was moved to the Tongshang Bank building on the Bund and was denied access to outsiders. This was considered the most painful experience for the general. After further negotiations, the general finally regained his freedom before the Double Tenth Festival. He talked to me in detail about the incident and searched for strong evidence in a large and thick scrapbook to show the misunderstanding of the concession authorities. He also explained his will that he would try his best to avoid all unnecessary disputes; but if violence were inflicted on him, he would make a proper resistance without any fear.

After that, I often walked around the Lone Army Camp. I took pictures of the daily life of the Lone Army Camp, and I collected old books and newspapers from relatives and friends to enrich the spiritual food of the warriors of the Lone Army. But I preferred to talk to the general, partly because of his enthusiasm and sincerity, and partly because of his rich wisdom. He asked me about everything in the Shanghai press, but I was just a journalism student. What could I understand? As a result, he gave me a lot of knowledge instead.

The general was not only brave, but also a learned scholar who never tired of learning. This was recognized by everyone who met with the general. His desk was piled high with books. I remember when I asked him to write an inscription in my commemorative album, he readily gave me the phrase "A warlike state has never perished" from Sun Tzu's Art of War. His writing was vigorous and unrestrained, which shows that the general's ability to make a name for himself was not accidental.

At the end of that year, I left Shanghai for eastern Zhejiang due to work reasons. When I went to the Lone Army Camp to say goodbye, he encouraged me with many words, just like a good teacher who patiently guides others.

Before I left Shanghai, I caused the general a disappointment due to a temporary oversight. This incident made me feel infinitely sorry for him for the rest of my life. Last summer, when I returned to Shanghai, the first thing I did was to run to him to confess my mistake. He did not mind at all, and flatly denied that it was caused by my negligence, and told me not to hold any grudges, and told me to come and play with him often. This made me feel even more uneasy.

But unfortunately, the general was killed by treacherous soldiers! No, although his physical body is dead, his soul is eternal and will never disappear!

### Ministry of Education Examines the Latest Developments in the Terminology of Academic Disciplines

(Chongqing Aviation News) The terminology of various academic disciplines in our country is independently translated by scholars in each field, resulting in discrepancies and inconsistencies, which greatly hinders the progress of academic research. After the establishment of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, the compilation and revision of terminology became one of its important tasks. The compilation process involves first collecting English, German, French, and Japanese terms for each discipline, carefully considering existing translations, carefully selecting and translating them, and then having the Ministry of Education hire domestic experts to organize a review committee to review them. Each compilation often requires two or three years of careful discussion before it can be published. Since the establishment of the Bureau in 1933, the terminology of fifteen disciplines, including astronomy, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, has been published. Thirty-two disciplines, including philosophy, sociology, politics, and economics, have been compiled or sent to experts for review. Thirty-three disciplines, including anthropology, physiology, pathology, and physical education, are in the process of being compiled. Currently, the terminology of seven disciplines, including society, education, economics, statistics, electrical engineering (power section), mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering, has been individually reviewed by experts in each discipline. The Ministry of Education convened a terminology review meeting on March 26, bringing together more than ninety scientific experts in education, social studies, economics, statistics, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. The meeting lasted for several days, and the review results were very satisfactory.

### The Tonghui Elementary School Teacher Strike Still Shows No Sign of Resuming Classes

The education authorities maintain their original stance. Although the teacher strike at the private Tonghui Elementary School in this city was jointly discussed and mediated yesterday by education officials, the chairman of the school board, and representatives of the faculty and staff, there is still no sign of a quick resolution. The reporter of Dahua News Agency recorded the situation as follows:

Yesterday morning, education officials first sent personnel to the school to inspect the current state of the school and the actual damage to the school equipment. It is reported that more than eighty broken glass panels have been repaired by the faculty and staff themselves. The damage to fifty or sixty sets of desks and chairs is not too serious and has also been repaired by hired workers. Subsequently, at 4 PM, they met with the chairman of the school board, Zong Pan, and the representatives of the faculty and staff, Chuanying, Gu Zongying, and Qu Lifan, for a joint discussion. First, the officials strongly urged the faculty and staff to resume classes first and then seek solutions later. Secondly, the chairman of the school board explained the intention of the board of directors to accept the principle of raising the salaries of the faculty and staff, which can be further discussed by the board of directors. As for the amount of funds in the corruption case, it should also be recovered. The issue of teacher security can be handled by the principal after the resumption of classes. Finally, the officials earnestly persuaded the faculty and staff to prepare for the resumption of classes today and officially start classes tomorrow. The representatives of the faculty and staff agreed to convey this intention, but it is learned that the faculty and staff of the school still maintain their original attitude, so there is still little hope for the resumption of classes tomorrow.

### Ding Fubao Gave a Lecture Yesterday on the Art of Health and Longevity, Listing Ten Key Points of Health

The academic lecture series initiated by Shou Yong, Zhu Bingnan, Tang Wenzhi, Jiang Weiqiao, and other elder figures in the academic circles of this city was held for the second time yesterday morning at 10 AM in the Xuan Gong Theater of the Pudong Fellow Association. Ding Fubao was invited to speak on the art of health and longevity. More than 700 people attended, filling the theater. Ding, nearly 70 years old, is old but vigorous. Huang Zunhua first stood up to introduce Ding as a senior figure in the academic circle, especially rich in research on medicine, and so on. Then Ding gave a lecture, saying that his body was weak in the past, but he studied medicine and health, practiced physical training, and was able to turn weakness into strength. He then elaborated on the principles of health in ten points:

(1) Rice must be unpolished rice. Eating too much white rice will cause beriberi. As for pork and various animals, they all have toxic substances and are most likely to cause disease, so vegetables are the most suitable. Water is also beneficial. Pearl rice is the most nutritious and can replace white rice, which is more beneficial to life.

(2) Take a deep breath once a day to prevent tuberculosis. There is no good medicine to cure tuberculosis, only air injections.

(3) Have a bowel movement once a day to excrete the waste from the stomach and intestines, otherwise, dizziness and bloating will occur, and all kinds of diseases will arise.

(4) Get enough sleep. The windows of the bedroom must be kept open at all times, day and night, to allow air to circulate.

(5) Abstinence is the first priority. Diseases such as nocturnal emission, headaches, and blurred vision all come from unwillingness to abstain.

(6) Exercise should be reduced after the age of forty, as it will degenerate. If exercise is too strenuous, it is easy to cause disease, so do not overdo it.

(7) Sunlight is the best. It can eliminate diseases. Exposing yourself to the sun is good for your body. Make sure that sunlight enters the room.

(8) Bathing is also beneficial to the body. Once or two or three times a day is best to take a cold bath.

(9) Mental stability is sufficient to maintain health. Always be content and never look for trouble yourself. Treat people and things with a calm and peaceful attitude.

(10) Although religions are different, such as the compassion of Buddhism in our country, it is also sufficient to cultivate oneself and cultivate one's nature.

### The Paramount Ballroom Basketball Team Will Return to Shanghai Next Week

The Paramount Ballroom basketball expedition team, which traveled to the Philippines in the middle of last month together with the Hong Kong Eastern Football Team, unfortunately had a dispute on the third day of their visit to the Philippines. Later, the Eastern Football Team returned early. The Paramount Ballroom team stayed for more than ten days due to the strong retention of the local overseas Chinese. Its leader, Gu Qikang, had also returned to the north earlier, and his troops were handed over to Chen Fuyu to lead.

### Tonight's Western Youth Women's Volleyball Team: Friendship Star vs. Western Youth Red; Group A: Yinghua vs. Russia for the Third Time

The Western Youth volleyball team will meet for the third time tonight between Yinghua and the Russian expatriate team. Yinghua's record in this tournament has been extremely sluggish, with no victories in six matches. However, when they met the prestigious Russian expatriate team, although they lost in the first match in straight sets, Yinghua gave them a great threat when they met for the second time. Tonight will be the third meeting. Although Yinghua has no hope of winning the championship, it would be a glorious page in the war history if they can defeat the Russian expatriate team. The women's team, Friendship Star vs. Western Youth Red, is also expected to have a fierce battle. The schedule is as follows:

Friendship Star - Western Youth Red (Women) 6:45

Beauty - Peide (Group B) 7:20

Russian - Yinghua (Group A) 8:00

### The Outer Space

— Jing Gu

The universe is a mysterious thing. It is often doubted by people. The ancient people without scientific brains said that it was ruled by a god. The most advanced scientists of the twentieth century said that it is endlessly expanding... Let's not worry about that for now.

What I want to talk about is "The Outer Space". Looking at the name, it seems strange. In fact, if you break it down, it's not worth a penny.

Because "The Outer Space" is the space outside the troposphere!

The troposphere should be a very common word. Simply put, it is the space six to ten miles from the ground. According to measurements, the temperature in this space is minus fifty degrees Celsius, so it is called the troposphere.

In the troposphere, because the air is thin, you cannot survive without bringing oxygen with you. However, above the troposphere, the air is extremely thin. People simply cannot go up, so scientists came up with a way to install the necessary machinery on a balloon and let it record the situation there.

The interesting thing happened. Everyone thought (even the most advanced scientists) that the higher the altitude, the lower the temperature. However, according to the "Mechanical" report, the temperature began to rise from the troposphere upwards, all the way to 100 miles from the ground. The temperature there is as high as 900 degrees Celsius, which is a ball of hot shell. The ability of radio waves to transmit far is also because when the waves are shot upwards, they fall to the hot shell layer and are refracted downwards (similar to the reflection of light). Therefore, radar waves are transmitted so far away.

According to this "report", we can infer that the scientists are racking their brains to try to communicate with "people" on Mars and other planets, but it has now been proven to be absolutely impossible. Because it is impossible for us "humans" to pass through this hot shell of nearly 1,000 degrees Celsius!

### Suggesting a New Type of Clothing—Intelligence Outfit

— Qi Zhai

Nowadays, people in society feel that Chinese clothing (referring to long robes) has many shortcomings, so changing to Western clothing (referring to casual wear, Zhongshan suits, and student uniforms) is becoming more and more common. Almost half of my friends wear Western clothing, and I myself have worn it for more than ten years. However, is Western clothing a perfect type of clothing? I have frankly discussed this issue with many friends. Everyone believes that Western clothing has no other advantages except that it is economical in materials, convenient for walking, and has many pockets. Chinese clothing also has many advantages except that it is not economical in materials, inconvenient for doing things and walking, and has few pockets.

Here, I suggest a new type of clothing, tentatively named "Intelligence Outfit". It is designed to eliminate the shortcomings of both Chinese and Western clothing and collect the strengths of both, and is extremely suitable for casual wear.

(See attached picture) I will now explain it one by one. Please give your expert guidance.

The length of this "Intelligence Outfit" is only two inches above the knee (city ruler), which is five or six inches shorter than the popular Western overcoat. This makes it as convenient as Western clothing for action, warmer than Western clothing, but saves the large pieces of material on the front and back of Chinese clothing. The sleeve length is only to the wrist, and the cuff size is about four inches. These are all the same as Western clothing, which makes it very convenient for doing things. The shoulder cut adopts the Chinese style, because our arms are rarely completely drooping. Even for people who do the least amount of labor, such as writing, their arms are not completely drooping. However, if you are making thick clothes (such as cotton clothes), you can remove a piece of cotton wool from the armpit or reduce it to extremely thin, so that you do not feel uncomfortable when completely drooping, and you are not restrained when raising your arms. The collar is two-thirds as high as the neck, and the front is lower. It can adopt the student uniform style, and it is also suitable to install a pair of buttons to make the appearance more neat. The front of the garment adopts a straight front style, which can save some material; therefore, the common Chinese-style short-sleeved garment is not used, so that it is somewhat different from this kind of short-sleeved garment to cater to the psychology of "distinguishing oneself from the non-intellectual world". This psychology is a manifestation of human self-esteem and does not need to be stopped. The waist is quite large, so movement is very convenient, very comfortable, cool in summer, and very hygienic. The hem can be the same size as the waist, and open a few inches on the left and right sides to make walking easier. Buttons can be knotted or machine-made. Pockets can be installed at will, and it is okay to have them on the outside. The pants also adopt the Chinese style. Although the material used in the waist is more than Western pants, it is still cost-effective because the wearing time is doubled. The upper garment is designed to be so long in order to cover the crotch area. The leg of the trousers should not be too big, and the leg opening should only be about seven inches. The length is level with the ankle, one or two inches shorter than Western trousers.

The tailoring method of this "Intelligence Outfit" completely adopts the Chinese clothing method, which is very simple, and even if you ask someone to make it, the labor cost is cheaper than Western clothing.

I am not good at drawing, so I cannot express all the beautiful points of the "Intelligence Outfit". But you can also see that wearing this "Intelligence Outfit" is quite impressive and elegant, and there is no sign of depression, nor is there any rudeness. At most, because you are not used to seeing it, it is a little unsightly.

I respectfully offer this economical, convenient and comfortable clothing to practical and reform-minded intellectuals.

### Broad Bean Seeds

— Long Ju Sheng

The season tells us that cherries will soon be red and plantain trees will be green. The only delicious food—broad bean seeds—is now on the market again.

Broad bean seeds are the delicious fruit that comes from the metamorphosis of broad beans. Broad beans (Vicia faba), a plant name, belong to the legume family. It is an annual herb, about three feet tall, with square, hollow stems and pinnate compound leaves. The leaflets are four to six in number, oblong in shape, and the stems and leaves are soft and juicy. In spring, flowers bloom in the leaf axils, with white petals and purple-black markings, papilionaceous corollas, and short racemes. The fruit is a pod, usually erect, and the seeds are used for food or for brewing sauces and soy sauce. The stems and leaves are used as fertilizer and for feeding livestock. The small broad bean has a very wide range of uses.

The most famous broad bean seeds in my hometown (Wuxi) are those from Qianqiao Township and Huishan, followed by Rongxiang and other areas. Every morning, the sons and daughters of farming families carry them to the market, shoulder to shoulder, heel to heel. Broad bean seeds and bean pods fill baskets, providing a great sideline for farming families. Farm women call out loudly, "Beans are wanted!..." Their oriole-like voices are delightful to hear. The Qianqiao beans are round and green, resembling jade treasures, and are extremely tender. Before the war, each catty of beans was sold for only a dozen copper coins, and each catty of bean pods for only six or seven copper coins (less than three cents). Therefore, it was not surprising that housewives bought them as snacks. Cooked with rich sauce and sugar, they are tender, glutinous, and flavorful! They are truly a great treat, not just for accompanying meals. Nowadays, with prices soaring, one can imagine that these emerald green broad bean seeds are worth much more than in the past.

### Weekly Home-Style Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

For the past month, we have often used yellow croaker, which is relatively inexpensive, as one of our meat dishes every day. Although we are getting tired of it, meat is still meat, and we can't do without it every day. Unexpectedly, with the fall of Ningbo, the price has doubled, and it is also hard to find bloody fresh goods. As for other fish, they always cost more than ten cents per tael. A small fish costs six or seven cents at once, which really makes people sigh "no fish to eat." Well, since it is not easy to eat cheap fresh fish, let's eat salted yellow croaker, salted ribbonfish, salted hairtail and other preserved goods several times a week. Although they are salty, they can still be served with rice and can also make you be merciful with your chopsticks and eat less.

Monday

Stir-fried water bamboo shoots with shredded pork, sweet and sour salted ribbonfish, radish shreds with scallions

Tuesday

Beef with yellow bean sprouts, stir-fried whitebait with scrambled eggs, braised garland chrysanthemum leaves, vegetarian tofu soup

### Rickshaws in Changsha

— Zhong Pei

While working in Changsha, the only mode of transportation is the rickshaw. However, if you are new to Changsha, you will find that the rickshaws there are the "tycoons" of all rickshaws. You can easily be annoyed by them. Therefore, people living in Changsha often advise new friends not to try it easily, so as not to "move earth" and get bored for no reason.

The only special feature is that the rickshaw pullers are unwilling to run. When you get into his rickshaw, he will slowly pace his steps, neither running nor walking quickly. If you are impatient and urge him, if he is happy, he will ignore you and continue walking. If he is also unhappy, or if you urge him repeatedly, he will simply stop, ask you to get out of the car, and say, "You run yourself, I don't do this business." He doesn't ask you for money or give you a tip, but just follows you and sees if you run or not, and then asks you why you don't run yourself... This is considered good. Even worse, if you urge him, he'll ask you to come down, sit on it himself, and ask you to pull and run for him, making you unable to cry or laugh and helpless to him!

Sometimes you want him to run, and he will, but you must make it clear in advance that you want to run. The price must be more than double, and only one or two out of ten will respond. As for when it rains, there is definitely no running. Can you imagine a master holding a Hunan oil-paper umbrella and wearing Du-made wooden clogs pulling you to run?

In addition, another feature is the lack of haggling. Once a rickshaw puller has said two cents, no other rickshaw puller will offer one cent and eight cents. This is also something that other places do not have. Other habits, such as a rickshaw puller who has received a considerable price today will never want to pull again, all show the stubbornness of our "home of soldiers." Changsha, the rickshaws in Changsha with a strong Hunan flavor.

Spring and Autumn

### Human Nature

— Sun Jianbai

I've been hungry all day and really don't know what to do. Borrowing from others: All the friends I know have already been borrowed from. After thinking about it, only Old Ma has never been asked. He is a "rogue," but I have to try my luck.

This guy never has a home, so it's really not easy to find him. After stumbling around for most of the day, I finally found him in a teahouse.

I told him a lot about my suffering, and finally begged him to help me a little for the sake of old friendship.

He smoked a cigarette while listening to me. After I finished speaking, he sighed, shook his head a few times, and then said to me with great sympathy:

"Brother! It's not that I'm saying this to you today, but you are too loyal! Otherwise, with your body, you would have followed me a long time ago, and you wouldn't have ended up like this. But your courage is small and your temper is so strong, how can you not suffer everywhere!" He paused here, staring at me. I couldn't help but lower my head, but I felt impatient in my heart: Damn it! I'm here to borrow money, not to listen to your lessons. According to my temper, I have to get up and leave, but my stomach is grumbling, so I can only endure it.

"However, everyone has embarrassing times. Since you, brother, came to me, Ma, I can't let you go back empty-handed!" He spoke slowly, took out two one-dollar bills from his pocket, looked at the numbers, and handed them to me.

"Here, it's two dollars. You probably know my situation. I don't have much money. This little bit can only be considered a small token of my appreciation!"

I took the money and couldn't help but thank him very much. I said:

"Old Ma! Thank you so much for helping me out of my emergency. I will definitely pay you back when I have money!"

"Don't mention it, brother! What's there to thank between brothers? However, I think it's not a solution for you to always borrow money from friends like this. You have to find something to do, right?" He suddenly frowned, looking at the sky, as if he was thinking of a way for me.

"What you said is true. I also think so, but I can't leave. It's really not easy to find something to do. I can only ask you, brother!" After being out for a long time, I finally managed to say these few words.

"Hmm, hmm," he smoked and sipped tea. After a while, he suddenly looked me up and down and then said:

"Brother, what kind of robe are you wearing? It doesn't look very old."

"Camel hair. It's embarrassing to say, but I only have this one magic robe!" I looked at my robe and thought of the dozen or so pawn tickets at home, and couldn't help but sigh deeply.

"Brother, I've come up with an idea now. I don't know if you're willing to lend me your robe for a while?" He suddenly said to me in a very low voice, with a very excited expression.

"What's the idea? What's the use of my robe?" I asked in surprise.

"A way to make money! You know I'm good at mahjong, but I don't have the capital to gamble with others. Now, if you take off your robe and lend it to me, I can pawn it for ten dollars and go to the general assembly to play a game of mahjong. If I win money, we brothers will split it evenly. I guarantee there won't be any problems. I just don't know if you're willing to lend it to me? Do you believe me, Ma?" He said very seriously, looking at me.

"Why wouldn't I believe you, but..." I hesitated, thinking quickly in my mind.

"It's okay. You can wait for me at your house. It'll take me at most three hours. Eight rounds of mahjong are very fast, and I'll come find you as soon as I'm done playing!"

I couldn't hesitate any longer, gritted my teeth, and took off my robe, thinking, "Old Ma won't "flake out" in front of a poor friend like me, will he? After all, we're old brothers!" Thinking this, I handed the robe to him.

He took the robe and asked the waiter to calculate the tea money. Then, he walked out of the teahouse with me.

At the entrance of the teahouse, we parted ways. Before leaving, he repeatedly told me that he would be back in three hours at most. I agreed and hurried home, because although the weather wasn't cold, walking outside in just a shirt and pants didn't look very good.

After returning to my home on the mezzanine floor, I first ordered a bowl of noodles from the noodle stall in the alley and ate it, then sat quietly waiting for Old Ma.

Money, robe, Old Ma, were all circling in my mind.

I waited until dark, but Old Ma still hadn't come. Calculating, it had been more than six hours.——I had been "tricked."

That way, not only did I get nothing, but I also lost my robe and couldn't even go outside!

In short, "Heaven never seals off all exits." The next morning, my cousin Ruisheng came to see me. He brought me thirty dollars, and I was able to get through this "gate of hell"!

However, I could never find Old Ma again. Maybe he was afraid of meeting me and being scolded by me. In fact, I just felt that I was really too "loyal."

### Small Bugs Become Big Bugs

— Sun Jiacan

The "moth," at this time when the spark has already started a prairie fire, its "worth" has suddenly increased "a hundredfold," and it can hardly be regarded as a "small bug." Therefore, it is honored as a "tiger," a "big bug."

It is said that dragons follow clouds, and "tigers" follow "wind." The tighter the "wind," the higher the "surge." The higher the "surge," the more "full" the "tiger's power" becomes. Don't you see that "beasts" bare their fangs and claws, wanting to devour the poor and all their kind before they are satisfied?

It was already difficult enough that the East Mountain "tiger" had just run away, but the West Mountain "tiger" came again. Originally, "that mountain tiger doesn't eat people." If it "doesn't eat people," what is it doing as a "tiger"?

"Raising a tiger brings disaster." You are considered lucky. But wait, one day, you'll see "our family's Wu Er coming"! Be careful, the "big bug" will become a "dead bug."

(7) A Cross Drawn on Her Face

Although he told Qiu Haitang about this later, on that day after dinner, when the mute girl was about to leave, Qiu Haitang had to make many gestures to her, asking her to quietly sneak back to the Yuan residence several times that night to help the nanny take care of Xiao Meibao; because not only was Xiao Meibao running a fever, but she had also been in a daze. According to the doctor Yukun brought, she might even have a convulsion. And Xiangqi absolutely couldn't go home to take care of her these days, so this mute girl had become an indispensable character.——Despite being deaf and mute, she worked very diligently and quickly.

"Second Brother, can I discuss something with you?" After Qiu Haitang saw her daughter take her medicine, she walked out with Yukun; when she was about to leave, she turned her face sideways, frowned, and asked him softly.

Yukun shrugged his shoulders, not looking at him.

"It wouldn't be to discuss my head with me, would it?"

"Don't joke!" Qiu Haitang smiled reluctantly. "I think Meibao's illness is not minor, and her mother definitely can't go back to see her. As for me, if they make a lot of noise with eating, drinking, and singing tonight, I may not be able to leave for sure. Fortunately, Tianle is very close to the Yuan residence. After your performance, come to the Yuan residence once, just say you have something urgent to discuss with me, then we can sneak back."

Of course, Yukun couldn't refuse this, but no matter how clever he was, he couldn't have foreseen that the reason he went to the Yuan residence later wasn't that Qiu Haitang was tied up by the eating, drinking, and singing; what happened in the evening was such a terrifying accident.

As soon as Qiu Haitang stepped through the gate of the Yuan residence, she seemed to notice that the old Zhang who was in charge of the gate gave her a very flustered wink, but she and Old Zhang never spoke to each other, and she really couldn't figure out why he would wink at her; moreover, there was also a servant and a bodyguard sitting in the gatehouse, and Old Zhang's expression seemed very afraid, which made Qiu Haitang not dare to ask him rashly.

"What does this mean?" She hesitated all the way, walking slowly toward the inner courtyard, and sat down in the room that Yuan Baofan usually used as a lounge, and looked at the clock on the wall, which was pointing to 5:31. (92)
