### U.S. President Calls on People to Rise Up and Resist the Axis Economic Encirclement to Safeguard Democracy and Enhance Freedom; New York Grandly Celebrates "Citizenship Day" Yesterday

Washington - President Roosevelt declared yesterday evening that dictatorial countries have already severely economically encircled the United States. The President also called on all Americans to rise up and fight to resist Germany and its allies' attempt to enslave the world economically. The President spoke at a foreign trade conference, from May 18th to May 24th, being Foreign Trade Week. The President said that the United States is rapidly moving into the world's most serious crisis. He said that aggressors are threatening the national, social, spiritual, and economic institutions of the United States. The victory of totalitarian countries will enslave the world economically. Thereafter, international trade "will be monopolized by a few countries that openly declare their conquest of the world." The President also said, "If we do not prepare now to defend the principles we rely on, then there is no point in talking about future international trade." He also said, "This defense, every American should immediately take as their own responsibility and make the greatest effort. At present and after the crisis has passed, the United States should continue its leadership position to implement and promote a free economy policy. If the United States wants to fulfill its responsibility to rebuild the world economy, there is no other way than to take a leadership position. At present, the world's economic problems are suffering from destructive restrictions, most of which are caused by aggression." (United Press, 18th)

Washington - President Roosevelt made a statement regarding National Trade Week, saying that the United States must safeguard democracy and continue to be a leader in promoting freedom and economic politics. Only in this way can the United States fulfill its responsibility to rebuild the world economy from the chaos caused by destructive trade restrictions. "We all know that we are now facing a truly tense global crisis. What is endangered by the aggression of totalitarian countries is not only our foreign trade and the prosperity of our national industries, but also the social and spiritual structure of our people's democratic life."

(United Press, 18th)

Chongqing - The Dagong Bao newspaper commented today, predicting that Britain and the Soviet Union will be the fifteenth and sixteenth countries to be conquered by Germany. The newspaper also said that Germany has accumulated sufficient strength to render the Monroe Doctrine ineffective, and as a result, Germany will economically conquer the United States. The article was written by Professor Sha Xucun (transliteration) of the National Central University. Professor Sha stated that the German-Soviet border is 1,000 miles long, and the Soviet Union has no possible defense, so the Soviet Union is very vulnerable to aggression. The article also discussed Germany's current economic strength, saying that since Germany has annexed fourteen countries and absorbed their natural resources, Germany's economic strength is at least equal to that of the United States. It also said that Germany, with its strongest organization and unparalleled technical capabilities, will soon become the world's number one fortress, and from this fortress will emerge a new Germany that will conquer the world. Germany today has sufficient food, munitions, and materials to expand its naval, land, and air forces. To say that Germany's position is the same as in 1918 is a foolish argument. It must be known that Germany's current power to wage a sustained war is far greater than in the last World War. It also claims that Germany already has

### Diplomats of Various Countries Stationed in the Soviet Union Prohibited from Free Travel

Moscow - The Soviet Union's 1936 foreign travel regulations, which stipulate that foreigners wishing to travel in the Soviet Union must first obtain permission from the relevant authorities and have their itinerary noted on their passports before they can pass, now also apply to diplomats stationed in Moscow from various countries. The Soviet authorities have now issued circulars stating that areas such as the Kola Peninsula, Murmansk, Leningrad, the Karelian Isthmus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, western Belarus, western Ukraine, Kyiv, Moldova, certain ports on the Black Sea, Crimea, the Baku oil fields, and other areas of Siberia are prohibited areas for foreigners to travel. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)

Various methods to overthrow Britain, conquer the Soviet Union, and make Germany the world's number one safe country. The article concluded by saying that the Soviet Union will gradually become a victim of Hitler's actions, because the Soviet Union's two western gateways, namely the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, are under German control. The article also pointed out that the new Soviet-German border is easy to attack and difficult to defend. Although the Soviet Union obtained a piece of Polish territory in 1929, it may soon become Poland's second. (United Press, 18th)

### China Motor Company Self-Manufactures Diesel Truck Parts

Chongqing - Since the China Motor Manufacturing Company established a loan with the German Auto Union-Wolf Company several years ago, it has intensified its efforts in automobile manufacturing and has received blueprints and all technical assistance from the Wolf Company. The company is now manufacturing Daimler-Benz type diesel trucks with a load capacity of two tons in large quantities. The first one has been completed and is currently speeding back and forth on the roads of Chongqing. Many of these types of trucks were previously shipped from Germany and run on vegetable oil. Now, the China Motor Company can also manufacture the parts for the truck itself. In other words, 50% of the parts on the newly completed diesel truck are manufactured by the company itself. It is said that the company will soon be able to manufacture all the parts needed for the car. (18th)

Lehman said that China is the border of the democracies of the Pacific. "If the freedom and independence of China's 400 million people are destroyed and they become slaves to the German, Italian, and Japanese military machine, then there will be terrible consequences for the United States economically and politically." Lehman also said that it is necessary to increase the hope and belief of these millions of democratic people so that China can remain the cornerstone of establishing a just and democratic civilization.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Luoyang; Several Fires Break Out

Luoyang - Today, hundreds of Japanese light bomber aircraft bombed this city in shifts with a large number of destructive bombs and incendiary bombs. In the four years of the Sino-Japanese War, this city has been bombed hundreds of times, but this time was the most serious. Bombers attacked in formations, at least five times, and in between the main attacks, there were individual aircraft flying around the city. The air raid alarm lasted twelve hours, the longest alarm in this battle. Bombs were scattered throughout the city, and the city's commercial district and western suburbs were heavily bombed. The Italian Catholic Church has been bombed twice in a week, with a total of two bombs. Casualties were not important, because the population has recently been evacuated, and there are excellent air raid shelters densely distributed in the alluvial soil. Fires broke out in several areas, but were quickly extinguished. Because the houses in the city were built of mud bricks and tiles, the fire could not spread. (United Press, 16th)

### Area of Wheat Planting in Various Provinces Greatly Increased

Chongqing - Since the outbreak of the war, the area of cultivated land for wheat, barley, and other crops in the fifteen provinces in the rear has increased year by year. In the 30th year of the Republic, it showed a sharp increase, which is a good phenomenon during the war. According to statistics from the Agricultural Intelligence Report of the Central Agricultural Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the wheat area in the fifteen provinces in the rear this year reached 130 million mu, an increase of 9.2 million mu compared with the 29th year of the Republic. The barley area reached 52 million mu, an increase of 1.7 million mu. The area of bean crops also increased by 2 million mu, for a total increase of 15 million mu. Among them, Sichuan Province's wheat area increased by more than 2.6 million mu, barley increased by 600,000 mu, and bean crops increased by 200,000 mu, for a total increase of more than 4 million mu. Since the beginning of spring, the climate in Sichuan Province has been mild, with favorable weather conditions, and there have been good harvests in various places. Good news has also been frequently reported from other provinces, with an estimated increase in food production of 15 million dan in various provinces. It is said that the increase in area is mainly due to farmers' automatic increase in production due to high grain prices, and the government's promotion of winter cultivation also has a significant relationship. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry formulated measures to promote winter cultivation last winter, ordering the Central Agricultural Institute to send personnel to assist various provinces in implementation. Thanks to the efforts of various provinces in implementing these measures, providing seeds to farmers, lending funds, opening up more arable land, providing technical guidance, and encouraging the people to assist in cultivation, the above results have been achieved. This year, the central government has allocated a large sum of money, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has established a Food Production Committee to expand the work of increasing food production. In the future, the results should be even greater. (18th)

Editorial

### The New Crisis in the Near East

Following Vichy's renewed submission to Germany, the war in the Near East has become increasingly extensive and complex. The British have taken hostile action against Syria for providing military convenience to Germany, and the British air force in Iraq has also begun to engage with the newly arrived German aircraft. In addition, Iraqi sources claim that Iraqi troops have crossed the outer border and the Diyala River, and there are reports that Palestine has been invaded. Compared with the German announcement on the 13th that the Red Sea is a war zone, it can be seen that Hitler is meticulously trying to compete with Britain in the Near East, and the threat faced by Britain is now more serious than before.

Reviewing the development of this situation, one cannot help but regret that Britain failed to accurately grasp the initiative and time factor. The outbreak of the war in Iraq was originally a preemptive move by the British army. Although Gailani appealed to Germany at the beginning of the war, the Nazis were unable to quickly come to his aid. If it were not for the Vichy authorities' "cooperation" with Germany, they would probably still be looking for a way to assist Iraq. During those two weeks, it is believed that the British army in the Near East did have the strength and possibility to quell the upheaval in Mesopotamia. However, in reality, apart from holding on to one or two strongholds, there was no progress. This stalemate continued until the completion of the German-French negotiations. Regardless of whether this was due to other difficulties or a mistaken belief that the Iraqi authorities could easily be cornered and subdued, strategically they had already fallen behind. The British have realized that destroying the Mosul oil fields completely is better than allowing the Nazis to seize them peacefully. Why did they sit back and watch the passage of time? Even if the British army still has full confidence in controlling the overall situation in the Near East, at least dealing with this complex and chaotic situation at present will be far more difficult than before.

Britain's management of the Near East, starting with Lawrence's activities in Arabia, has a history of nearly 30 years. Although there have been some separations and changes during this period, they have established a deep foundation in political, economic, and military aspects. After the start of the European War, they stationed heavy troops in this corner, with General Wavell, commander of the Near East Army, sitting in Palestine. In addition, the British Navy has always controlled the sea power of the Eastern Mediterranean. Therefore, even if Syria is no longer a base for resisting Germany, the British still have an absolute advantage, which the Axis powers cannot match. Now Germany has obtained the convenience of transporting troops through Syria, and that place is no less than 500 nautical miles away from the nearest base of Germany and Italy. In addition, the naval fortress of Cyprus lies not far from the Syrian coast, and it is impossible for Germany and Italy to transport large armies. It is expected that the only way the Nazis can use is in the sky—transporting air force and troops. If the British prevent it carefully, it will not be easy to achieve. The worrying thing is that if this war continues in an expanding situation, the various problems contained within that region, such as the Jewish-Arab dispute in Palestine, have troubled Britain for many years. Although it has temporarily calmed down in the past two years, the dispute has not been resolved. The long-brewing Pan-Arab movement has always regarded Britain as an obstacle in its path, and it is also the goal that the Axis powers have been trying to use. Although the head of this movement, King Ibn Saud of Hejaz, has always stood on the side of Britain, and Mussolini, who claims to be the savior of Islam, has also caused widespread resentment among Muslims because of the annexation of Albania, this action in Iraq has clearly been used by the Nazis. Yemen has always been in alliance with aggressive countries and has close ties with Italy. What's more, because of the accumulation of various historical evils, even some clear-headed Muslims do not regard the Nazi victory as a place to pin their hopes for their own liberation movement, nor do they feel any interest in the British victory. When the opportunity arises, they will inevitably explode in actions to seek independence and liberation. Even if it is not planned by Germany and Italy, it will cause major difficulties for the British. Perhaps the reason why the British army has been slow to advance in Iraq recently is to avoid overly stimulating the Arabs' feelings and is unwilling to act rashly. It is expected that the Axis powers will not only carry out military operations, but also make the greatest efforts in propaganda and agitation. What has been seen in Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia may not be seen again in the Near East Mandate and the Arabian Peninsula. This threat may be more worrying than military responses.

For the moment, we can only hope that the Arab people deeply understand that no small or weak nation can obtain any guarantee of benefits from the victory of aggressors, and that acting as an accomplice, whether subjectively or objectively, will only cause trouble for themselves. The local British authorities should also pay close attention to the emotions of the general public and make good amends for historical mistakes. The traditional colonial policy will only increase their own troubles in times of crisis. Militarily, they must act decisively and quickly overcome various potential crises to stabilize the overall situation in the Near East. Of course, as Churchill said before, the final contest between Britain and Germany depends on the decisive battle in the Atlantic. If the Nazis are now working hard to launch a major war in the Near East, it proves that he is fully confident in the Atlantic and the English Channel. However, although the Iraqi oil fields and the Suez Canal are important, they are tangible gains and losses. What is even more precious is the prestige of the British Empire. If they had not suffered defeat in the Balkan campaign, perhaps Vichy would have been more tough on Germany? At this critical moment, we sincerely hope that the British authorities can make effective responses in a meticulous and flexible manner.

### Hull Says Franco-German Cooperation Endangers Western Hemisphere Security; President's Condemnation of France is Well-Founded; Vichy Denies Germany Will Occupy Dakar Port

Washington, Secretary of State Hull declared here yesterday that official sources have confirmed that President Roosevelt's condemnation of certain actions of the Vichy government and his feelings about Franco-German cooperation are well-founded. Hull refused to directly comment on the sharp reaction of the Vichy government to President Roosevelt's frank condemnation of Franco-German cooperation, continuing that the State Department has received multiple reports indicating that Franco-German cooperation does endanger the security of the Western Hemisphere, according to a United Press dispatch on the 18th.

Vichy, US Ambassador to France Leahy stated yesterday that there has been no change in US-French diplomatic relations, and he will continue to stay in Vichy to maintain regular contact with the French government and General Pétain. Various rumors circulating outside are not credible, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 18th.

Vichy, the French Information Agency announced tonight that a report in the New York Times stated that Darlan had discussed with Hitler the issue of Germany occupying the French West African port of Dakar. This statement has been formally denied by the government. Dakar belongs to France, and the government has been closely monitoring it and is prepared to resist any foreign aggression, according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.

Washington, Florida Senator Pepper advocated yesterday that the United States should seize Dakar and other French military strongholds to prevent them from being used by Germany to endanger the Western Hemisphere. He accused Germany of using force or cooperating with the Vichy government to take over Dakar as a base for attacking South America. Pepper made these remarks after meeting with President Roosevelt, but he said that this speech was purely his own idea and was not authorized by President Roosevelt. However, it is recalled that Pepper is known for creating "trial balloons" to test public reaction. If his exploratory remarks receive a sympathetic response, they often become part of government policy. Pepper pointed out that the United States seizing Dakar and other key points could avoid future bloodshed because if Germany occupies these strongholds, it would be much more difficult for the United States to resolve the issue, according to a United Press dispatch on the 18th.

Vichy, the cabinet usually holds a weekly meeting on Saturdays, but it did not take place today, which surprised many people, according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.

Vichy, after studying the news from Washington yesterday, the French government concluded that the stationing of US coastal defense forces on the Normandie and other French ships stranded in US ports did not constitute confiscation of those ships because the United States still allows French crew members to reside on the ships. However, unconfirmed reports claim that France may suspend weekly sailings to Martinique from Marseille to prevent further ships from being seized, according to a United Press dispatch on the 18th.

Ottawa, an editorial in the Montreal Daily Gazette argues that the Vichy envoy to Canada should not be recognized because the envoy is clearly a representative of the German command. The newspaper also suggests that Canada should take over the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 18th.

### Soviet Internal Security Forces Complete Military Exercises

Moscow, the large-scale military exercises of the internal security forces held in the Moscow province, with the participation of 250,000 civilian defense volunteers, have now been completed. A notable feature of these exercises was the landing of troop transport aircraft and the assembly of paratroopers near industrial areas. Reports indicate that although the paratroopers were good at concealing themselves, they all failed to reach their intended target locations, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 18th.

### Spain Holds Secret Cabinet Meeting; Denies Suñer's Resignation

Madrid, the Spanish cabinet held a meeting last night, chaired by Franco. The meeting was conducted in a secret manner as always. According to political figures, in addition to discussing the transfer of some officials, there will be no policy changes, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 18th.

### Pravda Editorial Says Soviet Union is Prepared to Respond; Closely Monitoring Situation; Completes Steel Production Plan Ahead of Schedule

Moscow, the Communist Party's newspaper "Pravda" recently published an editorial calling on the people to obey the orders of the Communist Party and fulfill their sacred duty to defend the motherland, stating that Soviet citizens should be prepared to respond to any eventuality. The Soviet government and the Communist Party, under the guidance of Comrade Stalin, are closely monitoring the development of the situation, and the Red Army has also completed preparations to crush any enemy offensive, according to a Havas dispatch on the 18th.

Moscow, in the first half of May, the steel production of various agencies under the jurisdiction of the Soviet People's Committee for Iron and Non-Ferrous Metals Industry exceeded the original plan. The average daily production of iron increased by 3.1%, and steel production increased by 1.9% (compared to the same period in April). From May 10th to 15th, the daily production of rolled metal increased by 5.9% compared to May 1st to 10th. The Chai Yuqiji Factory recently issued a declaration requesting workers in the metal industry to complete the six-month production plan ahead of schedule. Workers in various factories unanimously responded and replied to the factory, stating their determination to increase production. Factories such as the Stalin Nizhnek Tagil plant have indicated that they can complete the six-month production plan ahead of schedule. A letter from the workers of the Magnitogorsk plant stated, "The country requires us to produce more steel to supply the Red Army and Navy with the sharpest weapons." Regarding this matter, Pravda commented, "We are currently completing the great task of building a communist society. This work is being carried out during the expansion of the imperialist war. The Soviet people are currently outside the war. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet government is pursuing a steady foreign policy and a policy aimed at the socialist interests of the Soviet people. This policy is purely backed by the strength of our motherland and the Red Army and Navy. If any enemy dares to strike us, we will retaliate with a two or three times more destructive strike. The 18th Party Congress requested the Soviet people to strive for new achievements in industry and transportation. The Soviet people's struggle to overcome difficulties has now been successful. Their patriotic awareness is very high and they will not compromise with the enemies of socialism. At the same time, their confidence in victory is extremely strong. This mentality has become even more fervent due to industrial and various successes. At present, the Soviet people can use their achievements to actively strive for future victories. Soviet soldiers never forget the hard work of the manufacturers when using their war equipment. Factories 8 and 13 have been awarded various medals by the government for their special achievements in manufacturing military supplies. Soviet arms workers directly participate in the work of consolidating national defense. Their efficiency is extremely high because they are always thinking about strengthening national defense. They all have the determination to inflict a fatal blow on the aggressors. The Soviet people love military science and can use any war equipment. No other people in the world love their national army more than the Soviet people. At the same time, the Soviet people are writing a heroic page in the history of world culture. They are moving forward along the path of communism. Our strength is now enhanced on the border and in the country," according to a TASS dispatch on the 17th.

Britain has always promoted victory, treated military victory as a success, placed hope on promises, and taken hope as a treasure. It is fitting that regrets and disappointments are piling up.

European War Chat (56)

### A Record of the London Fire

At ten o'clock, we found a young coachman with jet-black hair, exceptionally shiny, who said he was very willing to see the fire scene, so he was willing to take us anywhere. He also heard that the flames had advanced towards St. Paul's Cathedral, and the City Hall was already on fire. Before we arrived, it might have been reduced to rubble.

We asked him to drive in the direction of the reddest sky, and then to St. Paul's Cathedral.

We lowered the rear window of the car and watched the sky from outside the window. As the car turned, we smelled the first whiff of burning. City fires usually carry a strong smell of rubber and the bitter smell of tar roofs. But this time, we didn't smell any of that.

After driving for a while, we arrived at a street where the police had blocked traffic. The coachman stopped the car, and we stuck our press passes out of the car window. The policeman saluted and waved us through. This made a deep impression on the coachman. He thought we were just two busybodies looking for excitement, but he didn't know we were reporters. After that, whenever we reached a police cordon, he would stick his head out of the window solemnly and say, "We are reporters." But the streets were blocked by fire trucks, so we had to stop the car and walk forward. We were shocked to see that the fire started in a house we were familiar with. It was a six-story building, originally the location of a newspaper and a news agency. The top floor was burning, sparks flying everywhere, and the roof had collapsed. We had been in this house several times, sitting at desks full of manuscripts, talking to reporters we knew. The windows on the ground floor were all pitch black. Except for the sound of hoses spraying water and the cracking sound of water being poured on the red-hot beams, everything was quiet.

The firefighters told us that the fire was raging and that St. Paul's Cathedral was already on fire. Margaret suggested going to see if her beloved cathedral was safe. This cathedral was a small, beautiful building in the middle of a row of old, rat-infested houses, but as we ran closer, what we saw was like a cathedral on Christmas Eve in a Christmas card. We only saw its dark side, with the holy fire shining through the windows, but the flickering firelight was unsettling. The firefighters had opened the doors of the cathedral, and the firelight was also shining out from the doors. We didn't avoid the heat and tried to walk as close to the doors as possible. The cathedral looked like an oven. The roof had collapsed, and the glowing beams had fallen on the ashes of the sanctuary. As we watched this magnificent building burn to rubble, we also thought that after the war, the people would enthusiastically donate money to rebuild an even greater cathedral. But Margaret was already heartbroken and couldn't bear to watch any longer.

We were surrounded by smoke and fire. Margaret also said that the smell was very peculiar. It wasn't the usual smell of wood, but somewhat fragrant. It was the smell of oak beams used after the first Great Fire of London 250 years ago, mixed with the scorched smell of the ancient records of the major commercial companies that had supported the British Empire for centuries. There was no more precious rose scent than the one from the burning of London. The scent still lingered on our clothes when we walked back to the car.

As we drove towards St. Paul's Cathedral, we passed a street with fire hoses crisscrossing like gray, thick chains. We drove carefully, weaving through the gaps filled with vehicles, and had to stop and go from time to time. I hope I never see this kind of scene again in my life. Except for our car, the rest were all fire trucks—nothing more than hose trucks and trucks carrying pumps, grappling hooks, and ladders—slowly driving into the fire in front.

We turned into a small alley and got out of the car to walk. Although the polite British police hadn't forced us to stop, and we had passes and could move forward, it seemed wrong to go on. The coachman said he had never seen this kind of tragic scene and didn't want to see it again in the future. We got out of the car, and he followed behind, only two steps away. We never noticed it.

As soon as we got out of the car, we felt a strong wind. Margaret's skirt was blowing up, and pieces of paper were dancing in the wind. I pressed my hat tightly with my hand, but I wouldn't hate wearing a hat when I went to the movies. Was the wind sudden? Had we not noticed the wind before we walked past those houses!

We turned into St. Paul's Cathedral Square and saw that the cathedral was still safe and sound. We could faintly make out the roof watchmen patrolling under the dome. But the street behind the cathedral was already on fire, and the buildings on the right were in danger of collapsing at any moment. The side facing the chapel was still dark, but the fire was raging and occasionally shining through the windows.

We walked through the fire ladders, crossed the coiled hoses, and went to the burning street behind to see the fire.

It was a dirty commercial area. We were surprised to stand in front of a small jewelry store and see a small, white tongue of fire extending from a gap in the black wall, illuminating the entire room like a dim electric light. As we were watching, another piece of plaster fell off the wall, and then a tongue of fire came out. After that, more and more tongues of fire appeared, and the entire wall caught fire in an instant. The gold and silver jewelry in the jewelry boxes glittered in the fire. This was a small jewelry store with only jewelry that poor people could rarely afford. There were also wedding rings that soldiers bought for women and framed photos that women bought for soldiers.

Pure white light often shot out from the jewelry boxes, and then quickly disappeared. The temperature inside the store must have been very high. Ghost fires danced on the counters. This may have been the jewelry exploding, but it seemed more like the celluloid combs suddenly catching fire.

The straps of the watches in the window were writhing in the fire like snakes, and the pigskin on the frames was also bursting. Where was the owner of this store? What would he do when he returned tomorrow and saw that his store had been burned to ashes? If we broke the window and took out some of his treasures, how could we tell what was valuable and what was not? (To be continued)

Ankara – According to sources here, several trains carrying war supplies were transported from Syria to Iraq on Friday and Saturday. As they had to pass through Turkish railways, and in accordance with agreed conditions, Turkey must be notified of any transport of more than one railcar of war materials. However, the Turkish side is unable to prevent this. It is generally believed that this transport will not continue, as it is said that Syria has very limited ammunition and gasoline.

### De Gaulle's Broadcast: Calls on French People in Syria to Take Up Arms and Expel the Enemy

London – The Free French News Agency's Cairo dispatch states that General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French movement in the Middle East, broadcast an appeal urging the French people in Syria to rise up against the policy of surrendering Syria to Germany. The full text of his statement reads: "There are those who tell you that the enemy does not covet French colonies and will not seize Syria. This is a lie. Syria is now being handed over to Germany so that Germany can use Syria as an eastern base to control England. Enemy aircraft, some with French flags painted on them to disguise their identities, have landed in Syria in the past four days and then flown away. Do you know where these aircraft are going? Some are flying to Iraq to help attack British forces, while others are taking over your land. Germany always sends troops deep into a country gradually before occupying all of its territory. This tactic is now being applied to Syria. Eight hundred tons of munitions stored in Baalbek are now being taken out and transported by rail to Baghdad to support the Axis powers' war effort within Iraq. There is no other name for this but aiding the enemy and treason. If you do not stop it, intentional aiding of the war and treason will be a stain on you and you will lose your honor. Soldiers, I know you will never agree to this shameful policy. Rise up quickly, take up arms, and expel the enemy!" (May 18th, Reuters dispatch)

All of his statements have been carefully and thoroughly examined by intelligence personnel to verify their value. This is highly reliable. At the same time, Hess is still recovering in a military hospital in Scotland, with his status the same as any ordinary wounded prisoner of war. (May 18th, Reuters dispatch)

London – Home Secretary Morrison said in a speech in London last night, "The arch-villain Hess is now in British captivity.

This is the third night of British aircraft raids on ports used by the Germans to launch their attacks, and the explosions were the most intense last night. Flames shot up into the sky, and observers across the sea knew that this was due to British aircraft using their new and powerful bombs.

### Fluid Battles in the Western Desert; Most German Mechanized Troops Captured; Continued Fighting in Abyssinia; South African Air Force Launches Large-Scale Patrols

Cairo – The battles in the Western Desert are now concentrated on the border and are not large-scale offensives, but rather fluid battles in the area between the border barbed wire and Jarabub. If the British forces can continue to inflict losses on the enemy in terms of troops and equipment, it does not matter much whether the battles take place inside or outside Egyptian territory. The British forces are now quite effective in capturing enemy soldiers and destroying enemy equipment. The captured enemy soldiers are all mechanized infantry and tank crews. Many of the tank crews were captured on foot after their tanks were destroyed by British artillery fire. The British counter-offensive at Tobruk has made the enemy feel the danger of a large artillery base behind them. Around Amba Alagi in Abyssinia, continuous fighting continues. The Italian forces there are holding strong positions, and both sides are vying for the highlands. The British side is making daily gains. The fate of Amba Alagi and its garrison of 10,000 to 15,000 troops is now sealed, and its fall is imminent. When that happens, the main road from Addis Ababa to Asmara is expected to be cleared, and the entire Abyssinian territory can be controlled, with only remnant Italian troops left to be eliminated. In the south, the British forces continue to advance despite the rain, having advanced twelve miles in the past few days. (May 18th, Reuters dispatch)

### Rice and Coal Prices Have Fallen: Hope for People's Livelihood Revival. Hope that the Authorities Will Persistently Enforce Orders. Rice Prices Will Not Be Difficult to Fall Below 100 Yuan. Rice Hoarding Depreciations and Competing Sales with the Authorities Will Have a Good Response

Within the two concession areas, the various firms that have purchased foreign rice from the Public Works Department (工部局) number approximately 740. In addition to the existing 600+ rice firms, more will go to the祥茂洋行 today to pay and retrieve goods from the godowns for market sale. Therefore, starting today, all rice firms in the two concession areas will be selling all of the foreign rice purchased from the Public Works Department.

Hoarders Depreciate and Sell: Benefit to the Common People

Last week's rice prices plummeted due to the large influx of Hong Kong and Rangoon rice handled by the Public Works Department, resulting in thicker stocks, and the reduction in shipping costs between Shanghai and Rangoon. The market price of small grained rice was about 7 yuan lower than the price set by the Public Works Department. Yesterday, the reporter specifically inquired with relevant parties whether this matter would affect the sales volume of the Public Works Department's foreign rice. It was said that the hoarders in this city, feeling that the large quantities of rice they had hoarded could not be sold when the Public Works Department's cheap foreign rice was on sale, were competing to depreciate prices and seek to sell them off, thus falling below the price of the Public Works Department's foreign rice. This phenomenon was not only anticipated by the authorities, but it was also the purpose of the authorities' handling of cheap Hong Kong rice. The more that large hoarders depreciate prices to sell off, the more that citizens can obtain even cheaper rice.

Rice Price Difference: Will Be Improved

However, the price difference between the rice depreciated and sold by large hoarders and the price set by the Public Works Department is currently too large. The authorities will have a good method to improve it, ensuring that citizens can obtain the lowest-priced rice. Also, according to a certain rice firm owner, more than a hundred rice firms that have not yet completed the payment procedures will go to handle the procedures for taking delivery of goods today, and will definitely not stop taking delivery because the market price of rice is lower than the price of the Public Works Department's foreign rice.

Second Batch of Hong Kong Rice: To Be Shipped to Shanghai Within Days

The Hong Kong rice purchased by the Public Works Department from Hong Kong was again loaded by the British company Jardine Matheson's裕生轮 with more than 10,000 bags yesterday. The ship docked at the Bund码头 outside the新开河 at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, and unloading began at noon. The rice ordered by the Public Works Department from Hong Kong: the first batch was 55,000 bags, and the total amount of the second batch was 24,112 bags, with a total amount of more than 79,000 bags. It is heard that Taikoo's嘉应轮 and岳州轮 are also loaded with Hong Kong rice from the Public Works Department, and they can arrive in Shanghai within days. According to reporter's inquiry, in order to prevent people from purchasing and hoarding the Public Works Department's foreign rice,立基洋行 will issue a registry book for selling rice today, ordering all rice firms to register the amount of the Public Works Department's foreign rice sold daily for verification.

Cheap Rice Trading: Must Comply with Laws and Regulations

Cheap Hong Kong rice has already started to be resold in the storefronts of various legal rice firms within the two concession areas. Citizens must purchase rice in accordance with the regulations, and it is strictly forbidden to incite crowds to riot or deliberately find excuses. At the same time, if any selling rice firms do not sell rice in accordance with the regulations, the rice-purchasing common people can directly report them to the authorities. It is understood that the authorities, in view of the issuance of Hong Kong rice, are purely aimed at suppressing rice prices and relieving the people's suffering. In order to eliminate malpractices, they have sent subordinates to secretly investigate various selling rice firms. If any rice firms are found to have illegal behavior, they will be arrested and investigated in accordance with the law, without any leniency, in order to warn the rest and stabilize the market situation. However, according to reports, yesterday a small number of rice firms, when encountering common people purchasing cheap rice, replied that there was a price but no rice, and the lowest rice price was still sold at 116 yuan. If this is true, it is truly a strange phenomenon in the midst of the rice market's loudly proclaimed price drops. The authorities should investigate the actual situation to correct it.

### There Are Many Japanese Military Supplies: In the Bombed Freight Car. Traffic on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Was Restored Yesterday

According to people from Wuxi yesterday, after the bombing of a train near Hushu Pass west of Suzhou in the early morning of the 16th, although it was repaired that night, only two trains a day departed from Shanghai and Nanjing on the 16th and 17th. The normal state of traffic will be restored today (ie 18th). What was bombed that morning was a long line of freight cars. It is heard that many military supplies were loaded, so the losses were considerable. According to people from the area, when Yu took the car to Shanghai passing through the bombed site, he saw that the locomotive had been removed, but there were still four freight cars overturned on the side of the road, which had been damaged beyond repair. About ten zhang of the track had been bombed away, so the roadbed was severely damaged. When the vehicle passed, it drove slowly to prevent overturning. The repeated destruction of the Shanghai-Nanjing Line has fully proven that the Japanese side's road protection work has completely failed. In the past, because the Japanese side was afraid that the railway would be destroyed, it ordered all villages along the railway to organize "Railway Protection Groups." East of Wuxi, every ten telegraph poles, there was a small pointed sentry box next to the railway, where personnel from the "Road Protection Group" were stationed every day. In case of an alarm, they had to report to the Japanese army at any time. Otherwise, in case of an accident, the "Group" had to be responsible. In addition, east of Suzhou, the Japanese recently built a small station to facilitate the defense of key sections. Electrified nets have long been set up, but guerrillas can still move freely. It can be seen that the above road protection measures are ineffective.

### The Current Power Restriction Measures: Will Remain Effective Temporarily. There Is Hope for an Increase in Fuel Supply. The Special Committee's Proposal Should Be Postponed

Shanghai Power Company is issuing the following notice regarding the temporary postponement of the implementation of power restrictions: "After reviewing the report of the Special Committee on April 8 of this year regarding power restrictions, it has been approved by the company and approved by the Shanghai Public Works Department at a meeting on May 14 of this year. The restriction measures stipulated in the report have now been approved by the Public Works Department at the request of the company for temporary postponement.

The company believes that industries should not be restricted during the period when there is still hope for an increase in fuel supply. However, the length of this postponement depends entirely on the outcome of the current discussions and whether the company's fuel reserves can maintain a quantity equal to 100,000 tons of coal. During this temporary postponement, all current restriction rules and fees will continue to be effective. These rules and fees have been announced by the company in the newspaper on April 21 of this year. All users related to the notice have also been notified by separate letters.

### Orphan's Paradise (1) Willow

Orphanhood is the most unfortunate experience for a child; I also lost my father at the age of eleven and relied on my mother to raise me to adulthood. It is pitiful that in my childhood, when I saw children with fathers, happy and carefree, I thought of where my father had gone, and I could not help but burst into tears.

The cruel war is imposed on the masses for no reason, and I don't know how many families have been destroyed and people have been displaced. The orphans and widows cannot be written by emptying the bamboo of the South Mountain; the turbulent emotions in my heart cannot be washed away by pouring out the water of the West River. In the world, countless fatherless orphans have been added, wandering, starving, unfortunately dying in ditches, and fortunately encountering saviors. What I am talking about now is an orphan who is unfortunate but fortunate.

Originally, in my hometown, wars were frequent. There was a family named Yang, who were brokers, with a family of five. The man was a manager of a small shop, and he could have lived a comfortable life, but unexpectedly, he was repeatedly hit by wars, and the whole town was reduced to ruins. Yang was no exception. His house was destroyed, and his store property was gone. In a moment of anxiety and anger, he died. The wife and three children left behind, in China's economic organization where men are the unit of production, have reached this point, and it is really impossible for women to do anything, and crying is of no use. Later, after various efforts, the eldest son was recommended to work as an apprentice in a small shop. The youngest daughter was adopted by someone else. The wife came out to work as a helper. There was still a boy left, who was living in someone else's house, but at 140 to 150 yuan per stone of rice, he had to help with at least 30 yuan per month. How could she afford it? If this problem is not solved, how can she get it! Later, with the help of Mr. Zhu Zhiyao, the child was actually sent to the Tushanwan Orphanage - Ciyun Primary School. Although their family of four was living in four different places, they each had a place to settle down, which was really a stroke of good luck and a blessing from heaven.

One morning, the sun was warm and the wind was gentle. Mr. Zhu Zhiyao borrowed a car, and I brought the child, and the three of us rode in the car together. We sped along the asphalt road as if we were flying on a soft carpet. Soon, we saw the twin towers of the Xujiahui Catholic Church standing tall. Our car drove straight towards the clock tower. After a while, we arrived in Xujiahui Town in the western end of the French Concession. Mr. Zhu Zhiyao, a vigorous old man, did not need to hire a rickshaw. So, one old man, one strong man, and one child got out of the car and walked, crossing small bridges, passing through barbed wire fences, and stepping into the church area. Along the muddy Puzhao River, the white walls of the church reflected each other, black and white were distinct, and the pure sincerity of Catholicism was even more obvious. After passing through the church gate, the towering two bell towers were even more friendly than when we had seen them before! I couldn't help but recall that fourteen years ago, Mr. Zhu Yanzhi had once introduced and guided a small group of us to visit the library and astronomical instruments of the Catholic Church, but it was a fleeting glimpse, and the observatory was far away in Sheshan. What we saw was only a small part of the instruments related to earthquakes. Although I can also say that Shanghai is my second hometown, this was my first time visiting the Xujiahui Church area. Talking and talking along the way, I looked up and saw the words "Tushanwan" on the white wall. We had arrived at our destination. There was a bridge across the river called Ciyun, which was built by Mr. Zhu Zhiyao. It can be said to be the first steel-framed concrete bridge in Nanshi. It has been decades now, and it only cost 200 taels of silver at that time. Next to the road is the Tushanwan Orphanage. As soon as we entered the door, a friendly doorman came out to greet us. This point made me think of something else. I also like to go to temples to follow the joy, but how snobbish are the monks; I have also been to groups of places to visit, but how arrogant is the camp door; in fact, these people's eyes are too blurred; people, are all people, why bother to distinguish between thick and thin, only recognize clothes and not people, is it not the human relations that should be in society!

### Our Country's Current Labor-Management Conflicts Ji Ze

Simply put, labor-management conflict is a dispute caused by the unequal distribution of interests between labor and management. This unequal distribution of interests dates back to the era of slavery after the system of private property, but at that time, productivity was weak and the people were unenlightened, so there was no so-called conflict between masters and slaves. After the Industrial Revolution, productivity greatly increased, and the wage system developed. At the same time, the conflict of interest between labor and management became increasingly serious, emotional ties became increasingly estranged, and the disparity between the rich and the poor became increasingly severe, until labor and management each became a major class. In modern times, with the development of industry, the standard of living has gradually improved, and prices have continued to rise. Workers' lives have become increasingly difficult. Coupled with changes in thinking, the unity of the working class and the occurrence of labor-management conflicts are inevitable.

Our country is not an industrially developed country, but a country full of semi-colonial and semi-feudal characteristics. The labor-management conflicts that occur in this kind of society are certainly not entirely the same as those in capitalist countries. It has its own characteristics; especially today when the country is in dire straits, labor and management share the same interests, stand on the same ground, and a bright future is equally built on the foundation of striving for national liberation. Therefore, the urgent task is to establish a united front between labor and management, and not to dig deep trenches between the two sides, resulting in the tragedy of internal strife.

The Content of Labor-Management Conflicts

The causes of labor-management conflicts can be broadly divided into two types: economic and management.

(1) Economic disputes are disputes between labor and management over the distribution of profits. During the recession of the business cycle, commodity prices fall, while the costs of raw materials and other items decrease very little. Corporate profits decrease, and the capitalists, in order to maintain the existence of the enterprise and the constant profit of capital, plan to reduce wages. Conversely, when all industries are booming, especially during wartime, everything is expensive, the value of money depreciates, the prices of products soar, and the value of inventory greatly increases, while labor costs decrease relatively. As a result, the capitalists take advantage of this opportunity to multiply their profits, while the laborers suffer and complain endlessly. Because the value of money depreciates, the cost of living increases, and their income is still estimated according to the past monetary value standard, so real wages plummet, and life becomes extremely difficult, so they demand additional allowances, hoping to get a reasonable share of the generous profits of the enterprise. If the former situation occurs and is opposed by the labor side, and the latter situation occurs and is rejected by the capital side, then disputes are inevitable, leading to strikes and shutdowns, which bring production to a standstill.

(2) Management conflicts are no less important than conflicts of economic interest, and the two are closely related. Management defects are particularly prone to occur in countries where science is underdeveloped, and are also related to the national character of acting emotionally. The so-called management disputes include disputes over working hours, disputes over the tyrannical attitude of superiors towards subordinates, demands for improvement in working conditions and material equipment, objections to employment and dismissal issues, and entanglements related to labor agreements. If this kind of conflict is not resolved for a long time, it can also disrupt the progress of production.

Since the establishment of the National Government in the 17th year of the Republic of China, labor-management conflicts have gradually decreased. Half of the reason for this is economic depression, and half is the adoption of stopgap policies by the National Government, such as the passage and implementation of the Amendment to the Labor-Management Dispute Act. Since the "August 13th" Incident, the country has faced a critical moment of survival, and the people should concentrate their manpower and financial resources to seek final victory. Any disputes must be resolved by peaceful and rational methods. However, in Shanghai, due to the special environment, the number of disputes has increased instead. Especially since the 29th year of the Republic of China, as prices have soared more quickly, the number of labor-management conflicts has been increasing day by day, which is extremely serious.

Judging from the 156 strikes and 62 disputes in Shanghai in the 28th year of the Republic of China, strikes arising from economic reasons accounted for 79.3% of the total cases; those arising from management reasons accounted for only 20.7%; and among management reasons, employment and dismissal were the most important, accounting for 17.2%; slightly less than the average of 20.7% over the past ten years; in economic cases, wages were the main factor, accounting for as much as 53.4%; the average for the past ten years was only 27.7%; an increase of more than double; allowance cases accounted for 25.9%; the average for the past ten years was only 1.88%; a surge of 14 times. As for the dispute cases in the 28th year of the Republic of China, those arising from management reasons accounted for 30.5% of the total amount, and those arising from economic reasons accounted for 69.5%. Among them, employment and dismissal cases suddenly dropped from the average of 65.6% since the 17th year of the Republic of China to 20.3% in the 28th year of the Republic of China, a reduction of more than three times. Wage cases rose from the average of 18.5% over the years to 30.5% in the 28th year of the Republic of China. Allowance cases soared to account for 39% of the total cases, exceeding the average of previous years by more than eight times. This is the content of labor-management conflicts in Shanghai in the 28th year of the Republic of China and a rough comparison with the average of previous years.

With the development of capitalism, the opposition between the two major classes of labor and capital has become increasingly serious. In wartime, economic and financial changes easily promote the growth of labor-management conflicts. However, in our country today, any conflict is not permitted by reality. The author would like to briefly state a few words below:

(1) Our country is truly engaged in a long and arduous war of national liberation. The so-called long war is an economic war. In this war, the most basic task of both labor and management is to strengthen production. Therefore, in order to seek a bright future, both sides must first seek victory in the war, and striving to stabilize the economy and strengthen production is related to their own interests. Therefore, any disputes must be resolved with a good attitude of mutual understanding and mutual assistance, in order to achieve the fairness of profit distribution and the rationality of enterprise management, and achieve the goal of maximum production efficiency.

(2) Since the "August 13th" Incident, the supply and demand of materials has been abnormal, and prices have soared. All large and small enterprises have made a fortune from the national crisis. Workers' lives have been extremely difficult. Taking Shanghai as an example, although workers' nominal wages have increased, when converted into real wages, they have shrunk from 100 in the 25th year of the Republic of China to 55.33 in the 29th year of the Republic of China. While capitalists are rejoicing in windfall profits, they must know that part of such profits is actually obtained by exploiting workers. Because of the step-by-step depreciation of the currency, enterprises obtain labor services from workers that exceed the real labor cost. However, in terms of work efficiency, this kind of behavior is obviously unwise, because the weakening of the quality and quantity of products will inevitably follow. Therefore, under the goal of benefiting the country, benefiting oneself, and benefiting others, it is appropriate to allow workers to obtain a reasonable share of the profits.

(3) The success or failure of enterprise management has a great impact on the workers' working psychology, and the working psychology and production efficiency are closely related. This has long been noticed and confirmed by efficiency experts, but entrepreneurs in our country rarely pay attention to it, resulting in significant losses in intangible ways. This kind of psychological system transformation is nothing more than using various material and spiritual methods to make each worker thoroughly understand its importance in the national economy and factory manufacturing, so that each person deeply feels that the wages of all workers in the whole factory are equivalent to their labor services, without any favoritism or bullying, so that each worker maintains the highest degree of right to make suggestions, cancels unnecessary interference, in order to eliminate the gap between labor and management. Other things like the establishment of consumer cooperatives and workers' clubs, the promotion of remedial education and free medical care, and the handling of workers' welfare such as storage insurance are also necessary. Although this kind of expenditure seems superfluous, the tranquility of society depends on it, and the soaring on the production table will naturally make up for the losses and more.

### On the Inappropriateness of Cash Discount Mu Shens

Since the implementation of the new monetary policy in our country, legal tender has been the only currency in the country. However, in Shanghai, there are three kinds of chips: (1) "Cash", (2) "Clearing", (3) "Remittance". Although the names are different, they are all legal tender. Except that cash is the main body of legal tender, that is, "spot chip", the so-called "clearing" and "remittance" are both "circulating chips" of legal tender, but the former can be cashed on the same day, while the latter must be cashed the next day. Therefore, in the past, the difference between "remittance" and "clearing" was only one day's interest. As for "cash" and "clearing", there was no distinction, and there was no doubt.

After the August 13th Incident, due to the provisions of the financial stability measures, "remittance" was limited to interbank transfers and could not be cashed. As a result, "remittance" became a "locked chip", all to prevent capital flight, while "clearing" could be cashed as usual. In other words, "clearing" can be exchanged for "cash", while "remittance" cannot. Therefore, the phenomenon of "remittance" exchanging for "clearing" must be discounted. At one point, the remittance discount rate was as high as several hundred yuan per thousand yuan. Now, the panic of remittance discounting has come to an end, and the discount rate is only a few yuan per thousand yuan. In principle, belonging to the same legal tender, remittance is exchanged for clearing, and a discount must be paid, which is not in line with the law. However, because one can be exchanged for cash and the other cannot, and because cash is indispensable in life, there are many people who are willing to suffer a discount loss, so the occurrence of this kind of discount can be misinterpreted in principle. Now, it is also necessary to discount cash for clearing, which is really puzzling! The reason why clearing is superior to remittance is only because clearing can be cashed for cash, while remittance cannot. Now, exchanging cash for clearing requires a discount, isn't this a strange thing?

Some say that at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, people were panicked and hoarding cash, resulting in a shortage of cash supply. There was a feeling that it was not easy to obtain cash, so cash appreciation occurred. Then, cash appreciation due to demand exceeding supply seems to be able to produce a discount due to supply exceeding demand. Therefore, the current cash discount is based on the law of supply and demand, and has its own cause. As everyone knows, due to the lack of cash, it is not easy to obtain cash for clearing, resulting in a difference. It seems more accurate to call this difference "clearing discount" rather than "cash appreciation". However, the difference between "cash" and "clearing" today, whether it is called "cash discount" or "clearing appreciation", is not appropriate. Cash is the main body of our country's legal tender, which is certainly not comparable to the banknotes in the silver currency era of the past. As for clearing, it is a kind of chip representing the circulation of legal tender, and its cashing is still based on cash as the country's image.

Based on the above, cash is the only currency in our country, and whether it is "appreciation" or "discount" is not a normal state of currency. If there is an imbalance in the supply and demand of currency, the financial industry has the responsibility to regulate it. Issuing banks are undoubtedly responsible, and other general banks or money shops should also work together to complete the important task of stabilizing social finance. For example, if there is a shortage of cash in the market, banks should find ways to supply it to meet social needs; conversely, if there is a surplus of cash in the market, banks should also absorb it as much as possible and supply clearing, which is called tightening currency. Now, the cash discount in Shanghai has been going on for more than a month. In early April, the discount for exchanging cash for clearing was as high as more than 30 yuan per ten thousand yuan, and it is still around 10 yuan. The majority of silver and money industries recognize the difficulties and respond appropriately. However, there are also some banks and money shops that do not have enough understanding and use the excuse of cash discount to impose restrictions on depositors depositing cash, or refuse to accept it, and even use the phrase "only handle cash" as a reason for returning checks for depositors of the same industry who come to exchange them. Once this end is opened, all checks for clearing are in danger of being returned, which will hinder the circulation of bills and pre-echo social finance, which is extremely important and huge. Furthermore, it allows the general speculators to take advantage of the situation, while the banks and money shops themselves are scolded by society; what could be more foolish and absurd than this?

Think about it, the cash received by industry and commerce in daily business operations is best deposited in banks and money shops as its only reasonable outlet. If the banks do not accept it as much as possible, how will these people dispose of their cash income? This is one.

The exchange method used by the same industry can avoid the risk of cash collection and settlement. Even banks that are not in the same exchange range, such as foreign banks collecting bills from Chinese banks, also pay with "exchange checks" to show solemnity and avoid danger. Now that the phenomenon of cash settlement has occurred, at this time and in this place, the risk of settling and receiving cash from each other is even greater. This is two.

The above two points are all superficial views. There are many wise people in the financial industry who will definitely check this as soon as possible. As for the banks and money shops that have lost control of their behavior, they only account for a minority. I hope that our entire financial industry, under the leadership of banks, will correct its mistakes if it has any, and encourage itself if it has none, in order to seek the early elimination of cash discount. Or it is said that the refusal to accept cash and the use of "only settle cash" as a reason for returning checks are all caused by cash discount. As everyone knows, this is mutually causal, and to seek the elimination of cash discount, one must first try to get banks to accept cash as much as possible, and can use clearing as usual to be effective. Otherwise, the existence and rise of cash discount is expected, which is a burden on the future of industry and agriculture, and is not a blessing for the financial industry itself.

### On Today's Labor Problems (Part 1) Hu Xishan

In order to strengthen combat effectiveness, increasing production is the current urgent task; we all know that labor is one of the factors of production, especially under the current economic structure of our country, because various places cannot fully obtain the use of machinery, manpower feels important. In the past, general capitalists believed that machines were the only essential element of production, while neglecting labor, which was a huge mistake. If labor problems are not properly addressed first, how can industry be revitalized? Among labor problems, wages, technical training, and labor-management coordination are all important matters. At this time of war, the need for materials has increased dramatically. If we want to increase production to adapt to this current need, how can we avoid labor-management disputes? How to improve the lives of workers? How to improve work efficiency? These are all problems worth studying. This article will make a brief review of the practical problems of labor today.

Improvement of Labor-Management Relations

The most difficult problem between labor and management is how to seek cooperation between labor and management to resolve all disputes between them? In socialist countries, labor and management are not divided, so there is no so-called labor-management dispute. However, under normal circumstances, labor and management often stand in opposite positions; labor always hopes that management can improve its treatment, while management, for its own benefit, is never willing to thoroughly satisfy the desires of labor. In principle, this is a relationship of mutual interests. The fundamental solution is to enable labor and management to coordinate. How to coordinate? This is a broad and complex important issue; the capital side should first understand the labor side, and give as much opportunity as possible to the labor, in order to encourage its spirit of cooperation. In any scale of industrial organization, managers and workers should take a consistent line of communication. The capital side should always be aware of the living conditions of the labor side under today's circumstances, as well as its general likes and dislikes and thoughts; at the same time, the labor side should be informed of the factory's current situation and the importance of wartime production, in order to strengthen the labor's work force; the operators of the industrial decision should also take into account the current situation of the country, and must not exploit the workers in order to make money; if the workers are exploited by the capitalists and live in poverty, the workers regard work as a hardship, and have no good feelings for the factory. Then the workers and foremen are prone to hatred, the workers cannot concentrate on their work, the work efficiency is reduced, and the lice tide is aroused, which is an inevitable phenomenon. Therefore, making the improvement of labor-management relations a primary condition for improving the production level and increasing the production quantity today.

Compulsory Mediation of Labor-Management Disputes

Disputes between labor and management are inevitable at any time. After the labor side is dissatisfied with the capital side, the labor movement is nothing more than a slowdown and a strike. In the case of a slowdown, the factory has not stopped working, and the workers still enter the factory to work, but the workers do not carry out the work according to the factory's purpose. The obvious phenomenon is deliberately delaying work and sabotaging factory objects; although this situation is not very serious, the product is drastically reduced and the damage to the factory is extremely serious. A strike means that the work of the entire factory is completely stopped. The impact is not only the cessation of production in that industry, but also the industries related to that industry will also bear joint damage; this phenomenon is extremely serious; the production functions of various industries in our country have been largely destroyed by the war; therefore, today's various types of products are mostly concentrated in a small number of industries; if there is a certain urgently needed item, now due to the strike of Industry A, the production is stopped, which affects Industry B, which is still related to it, and the same stops co-production because it cannot obtain the raw materials for manufacturing. To put it more broadly; the cessation of production in an industrial unit is enough to cause several related industries to stop at the same time. This situation will inevitably cause great obstacles to the industrial production of the time. In order to absolutely prevent the occurrence of labor-management disputes, we must try our best to avoid the occurrence of conflicts in advance, and implement compulsory means to mediate afterwards.

In order to obtain a fair and rapid solution to labor-management disputes, a wartime or special labor-management dispute arbitration committee can be set up, which will be organized jointly by the local government and labor-management representatives. The committee should resolve labor-management disputes in the most recent and rapid manner, and never prolong the date. First, it can conduct persuasion and explain the importance of the industry at present, so that it can reconcile and immediately resume production: in the case of important industries, when the labor side does not accept arbitration and the capital side is sure that it cannot accept its demands, the government can assist the capital side in handling it. If the capital side does not accept arbitration, the government can directly send personnel to take over the industry on behalf of the capital side in order to take into account the production of the industry, and pay all manufacturing expenses on behalf of the capital side, and accept the reasonable parts of the labor side's demands. During the production process, labor and management can still send representatives to mutually agree; after the government resolves the disputes between the two parties, it can still transfer its management responsibility, and the original capitalist will operate it.

### Woolen Fabrics for Autumn and Winter Hoarding is Particularly Severe

Recently, the trend of woolen fabrics varies due to differences in supply and demand, and diverse sources of production, resulting in uneven sales. It has been found that the most severely hoarded and increased prices among our colleagues are for autumn goods such as overcoating wool, heavy plain wool, Melton, suiting flannel, Homespun, Serge, riding breeches cloth, tweed, mohair, seabird cloth, single-sided flannel, broadcloth, medium-heavy serge, and hairline twill. The reasons for the price increases are due to the following facts and atmosphere: (1) Foreign firms must pay a deposit when ordering and prepay exchange bills, and insurance and additional charges are frequently increasing, so ordering transactions have now stopped. (2) As the European war spreads and expands, not only are the delivery dates of previously ordered goods delayed, but it is also unpredictable whether half of them can arrive in Shanghai. (3) Due to the same raw material transportation difficulties and increased expenses, the output of local factories is bound to be scarce and expensive. (4) Factories are not accepting orders, and middlemen are adding another 10% to the price and are also taking back sample books. (5) Many inside and outside people are focusing on this type of autumn and winter goods. (6) The atmosphere is tense, and people's hearts are high, so even though it is difficult to determine in advance what actual sales will be in the future, everyone is blindly following, trying to hoard as much as possible, which makes them increasingly popular and increasingly scarce.

Miscellaneous Items
### The Speculative Air of Soap, Candles, and Matches Has Subsided

The market situation for daily necessities last week was generally trending downward. For example, the price of soap previously soared due to the manipulation of speculative hoarders and the impact of the European war, which slightly reduced the supply of raw materials, and factories reduced the distribution of goods to colleagues to prevent market speculators from hoarding. However, the opposite happened, and the hoarding trend became more rampant, causing market prices to skyrocket. For example, the price of "Gu Ben" soap rose to a high of 60 yuan, which slightly weakened, leading to a large reduction in general purchases, and miscellaneous brand soaps rose to replace it. The firm had no choice but to stop trading with outsiders, but the results were minimal. Currently, speculators see that food and other items are generally reporting declines, and the international situation is fluctuating, with very few actual sales, making it difficult for the market to recover in a short period of time. Those who made profits are seeking to sell off their goods, leading to a glut of spot goods on the market, and colleagues are not eager to buy, so the market has declined in a straight line. For example, on Saturday, "Gu Ben" soap loosened to 56.5 yuan per case, "Bai Xiang Mao" soap to 46.5 yuan per case, "Huang Xiang Mao" soap to 41.2 yuan per case, and "Jian Dao" soap to 43 yuan per case, all falling by one or two yuan. The market for matches is also trending weakly, because sales on Wood Street are sluggish, and customers are not eagerly purchasing, causing prices to fall accordingly. "Mei Li" brand is 704 yuan per case, "Feng Huang" brand is 692 or 3 yuan per case, and miscellaneous brands are around 600 yuan. The candle market is calm, with "Fan Chuan" brand at 26.6 yuan per case and "Ji" brand at 26.5 yuan per case. Overall, the market situation is currently stable.

The Fuel Problem
### When Will it Fall Like the Price of Rice?

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council implemented the public sale of rice, rice prices have been effectively stabilized. However, coal remains expensive, with white coal at 400+ yuan per ton and coal briquettes at 16 yuan per dan, making it difficult for most people to cook even with rice. Although the difficulty is not as great as having no rice, it still poses a great threat to daily life. It is said that the increase in coal prices is also due to water transportation costs. Those who make endless fortunes from war are only in the shipping industry. Not to mention foreign merchants owning huge numbers of ships and making huge profits, which may be several floors high, even those with three or four or even one or two ships have earned tens or hundreds of thousands of yuan in these three years. There is an old saying that "every day brings a peck of gold," but for today's shipping merchants, it is not just a peck of gold, but a stone's worth. Moreover, the hoarding and speculation of other goods is easily understood, but shipping merchants are quietly reaping huge profits without being noticed or condemned by the world. As a result, Chinese merchants who used to engage in the shipping industry are also regretting that they did not keep two ships when they saw others making a fortune, and that they were always dissatisfied with the unfairness of the world, which is often applied according to the person. Things that are difficult for ordinary people to do can be done by those with power. This is not unique to Shanghai. If there is a solution to controlling and manipulating the shipping industry, not only rice but also coal prices will easily fall by half.

But the facts cannot be said in this way. If so, coal merchants will secretly clap their hands and rejoice. If coal companies do not sell coal in bulk to hoarders, or if coal merchants do not close down and sell directly to users in batches, coal prices would not be so high. Because coal merchants and hoarders (insiders and outsiders) are in cahoots, all the coal is hoarded. Even if water transportation costs fall, coal prices will still not fall, and it will only benefit the hoarders. The black market price of coal briquettes was previously more than 16 yuan. Now, coal briquettes are becoming increasingly inferior, even mixing chimney coal ash with yellow mud and coal dust as a substitute. Hongji coal dust used to ignite quickly, but now it is used less, making it difficult to start a fire. Therefore, some people have come up with the idea of mixing wood chips to make it easier to ignite. The fire is easy to start, but the heat is not strong and burns quickly. (To be continued)

### Seeing, Hearing, Thinking

When purchasing and transporting the first batch of Hong Kong rice, the US exchange rate was only around 5.125 yuan, and the rice weevils had already caused such a big impact. Now the US exchange rate has reached 5.375 yuan, and it is not difficult to exceed the 5.5 yuan mark; moreover, the mold season is approaching; the anxiety of the hoarders can be imagined.

The Shanghai Municipal Council's operation and sale of foreign rice has achieved great results. It is hoped that they will further crack down on hoarding to eliminate chaos. What constitutes hoarding? The recently promulgated "Temporary Regulations for the Punishment of Violations of Food Management During Extraordinary Periods" by the National Government has the following provisions:

(1) Those who are not engaged in commerce or merchants who are not engaged in the food industry, but who purchase and hoard food for profit.

(2) Merchants engaged in the food industry who purchase and hoard food but do not sell it as stipulated by the food authorities.

(3) Food households who hoard surplus grain and evade and conceal it after being required to sell it by the food authorities (Article 3 of the law).

(4) Those who hoard 15 stones or more will be sentenced to detention or a fine of less than 1,000 yuan (Article 4, Paragraph 6 of the law).

(5) Without approval, civilian households shall not store more than two months' worth of food, nor shall they continue to purchase more than two months' worth; otherwise, it will be confiscated (Article 6 of the law).

It is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will refer to the local situation and also define hoarding so that citizens can report it.

Churchill did not pay Hess "wages" at all, and Hitler's "peace offensive" completely vanished like a bubble. In the speculative market, it became worthless.

Speculators have the most "naive" views on international issues and are the most likely to reach "conclusions."

### Life Elements

— Shunqin

Life elements, also known as vitamins, are essential for people in life. When life elements are lacking, specific obstacles will occur in life, leading to diseases. According to what has been discovered and confirmed today, there are the following five types. The presence and function of each life element are briefly discussed below for the readers:

Vitamin A is mostly contained in the oils and fats of animals and plants. Butter, ghee, cod liver oil, mutton tallow, coconut oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, etc., all contain it. However, pork lard is completely lacking, and eggs and grains also contain a small amount. Those who lack vitamin A will develop dry conjunctivitis, and in severe cases, even blindness. This vitamin is also related to physical development; therefore, those who lack vitamin A should eat more egg yolks and liver. If one cannot afford to buy animal and plant fats, use fresh vegetable soup, as green vegetables also contain a small amount of vitamin A.

Vitamin B is mostly contained in the outer skin and bran of grains, and yeast is very rich in it. Other foods such as lentils, egg yolks, peas, beef, and potatoes also contain a small amount. Those who lack vitamin B will develop beriberi. If not treated quickly, the swelling can spread to the abdomen, posing a threat to life. Dutch doctor Eijkman discovered the relationship between this disease and grains. Eijkman conducted experiments on prisoners in East Indian prisons and concluded that those who eat coarse rice rarely suffer from beriberi, while those who eat white rice are very prone to beriberi. Therefore, the rice we eat should not be milled too white, as the outer layer of rice contains substances that resist this disease; at the same time, we should eat more plant leaves and beans. Vitamin B is also known as the anti-beriberi vitamin.

Vitamin C is mostly contained in fresh fruits and vegetables. Lemons, oranges, cabbage, tomatoes, turnips, and milk are the richest in it. Those who lack vitamin C will develop scurvy. The symptoms are sores in the stomach and intestines, subcutaneous bleeding, brittle bones, and loose teeth. Many people die from this disease; it is usually most common among sailors because there is no fresh food on ships during wartime and voyages, resulting in yellow faces, emaciation, and weakness, making them very prone to scurvy. Vitamin C is also known as the anti-scurvy vitamin.

Vitamin D is also known as the anti-rickets vitamin. Those who lack this vitamin will definitely suffer from rickets. If children do not receive sufficient food containing vitamin D when they are four or five years old, or even seven or eight years old, and do not see enough sunlight, they will definitely suffer from this disease. After the end of the First World War, the German people lived in poverty and lived in underground caves, never seeing the light of day all year round. Many children suffered from rickets. Later, the patients were exposed to the sunlight naked, and they gradually recovered. Those who suffer from this disease should eat more cod liver oil and milk, but sunlight contains natural vitamin D, and green vegetables also contain a small amount of vitamin D.

Vitamin E is mostly contained in animal muscles, wheat germ, corn, and peas. Animals lacking vitamin E will lose their reproductive function.

### Standards for Women's Decoration

— Xu Xiaoge

Humans are full of emotions and have a strong love of beauty. Who doesn't want to decorate themselves to be beautiful and good-looking! This love of beauty is especially evident and strong in women, so even if their daily lives are very difficult, they save money and economize to decorate their beauty. Indeed, women's decoration is very appropriate, because beauty in life can make life flavorful, and decoration is the way to make people beautiful. Women are decorated well, simply like a beautiful flower, and the love between husband and wife or lovers will therefore deepen. Isn't this the happiness of life? Now, I list the principles that decoration must meet, hoping that wives and young ladies will refer to them:

(1) Suitable for Hygiene: Generally, many women only care about seeking beauty and neglect the hygiene of their bodies. For example, corsets and high heels are extremely unhygienic decorations, because corsets hinder lung breathing, and prevent the movement of the stomach and intestines, the impact on the body's health is really great, and how uncomfortable it is in daily life! Wearing high heels can affect the development of the feet, and have the same harm as foot binding in our country, the movement is very inconvenient, what is the difference with the shackles worn on the feet of prisoners? It is really regrettable to turn a good free person into a unfree prisoner; so decoration only takes care of beauty and makes the body suffer, then it is not worth it.

(2) Do Not Be Too Extravagant: We must look at the family's economic situation when decorating. It is certainly unnecessary to go into decoration while starving, but also do not be too undecorated. Families with sufficient economy can spend a little more on decoration, but it should not be too extravagant. Families with insufficient economy should try to save money on decoration, because there are other more important things to be done than decoration. Poor women must not only take care of decoration and forget this point.

(3) Be Artistic: The beauty of art is the real beauty, which is not vulgar and elegant, and makes people feel happy after appreciating it; the higher the level of civilization, the more artistic the decoration of their women. Therefore, the ports with convenient transportation are more artistically decorated than the remote and blocked countryside; civilized nations are more artistically decorated than barbaric nations, just look at how ugly the decorations of women of barbaric nations in movies are! The decorations are so bulky and strange. Our civilized people's decoration must be like an elegant poem, lightly depicted, and do not make it too bright, because too bright will be too vulgar and without artistic value. Therefore, clothes should be made of plain materials, short and not permed hair is the best, powder should be applied with thin lips, and Rouge should be lightly applied. In short, as long as it meets the beauty of art, you can decorate it at will, but do not make it too strange.

### Residence in Prevention of Tuberculosis

— Meizi

Recently, the anti-tuberculosis movement has been promoted, which is indeed beneficial to the public. Therefore, I think that everyone should also pay attention to it in their own families, so as to enhance the effect of anti-tuberculosis. Now, I will write down a few points that I have thought of below, which may be slightly helpful for reference?

(1) Wash the Spittoons Frequently: No matter which household, there are always several spittoons, but most people are too lazy to wash them. Often, some families only wash them once a day, or even once every few days. What's more, they treat the spittoon as a garbage can, throwing all kinds of dirty things like fruit peels and grains into the spittoon for convenience. This is so harmful to hygiene; in addition, flies will be produced in the future, and the spittoon is where they breed, so washing the spittoon frequently will definitely be very beneficial.

(2) Empty the Garbage Frequently: The garbage swept from the room should be taken out and dumped at any time, otherwise a gust of wind will still blow it all over the ground. We can often see that some people sweep the floor and must sweep the garbage into the corner of the door, and only take it out and dump it when it has accumulated a lot. How do you know that day after day, it has become the birthplace of all poisons, so the garbage should be emptied frequently.

(3) Separate the Tableware: Chinese families do not separate teacups, rice bowls, chopsticks, spoons and other tableware for each person, which is not good. In fact, separation is easy, just write each person's name on their utensils to identify them. Fortunately, it is not troublesome, and everyone can promote it; besides, this is also hygienic?

(4) Treat Minor Illnesses Quickly: In an ordinary family, if a child has a cough, the parents are always reluctant to see a doctor immediately, thinking that it is a minor cold and does not matter. How dangerous this is! Therefore, it is always best to be anxious about the illness first, and of course it is even better to go to the hospital for a physical examination regularly.

In short, the residence should be washed and swept frequently, so that it is always kept clean, then it can definitely prevent the invasion of tuberculosis bacteria, and it is also important to pay attention to hygiene when eating.

### The Most Exquisite Train in the World

— Xinfang

The British government has a train for the use of the royal family when traveling. Recently, because the original one was old, a new one has been completed, which can be called "the most exquisite train in the world." Now, let's introduce it.

Speaking of this train, the date of completion was after the outbreak of the war. The entire project was undertaken by railway experts from London and Scotland. The entire car has three sections, which are evenly distributed, one section belongs to the king, one section belongs to the queen; and the other section belongs to the two princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret. The king's section has a bedroom and a bathroom, and the arrangement of the reading room is especially exquisite. The ceilings of each room are all painted milky white. The Queen's section is everywhere mainly suitable for women to live in. These two sections are each 65 feet long. The princess's section is the simplest, with only a living room in addition to the bedroom.

There are several characteristics of this car worth mentioning: Generally, people have this concept that a train dedicated to the royal family should have heavy military protection, but this car is the opposite. The second point is that there are heating and cooling facilities; the temperature inside the car is not affected by the climate outside the car. The third point is that when this car stops at a certain station, it can make calls to any part of the world. The last point is that all the furniture in the car is completely silver-plated.

Today's King George VI usually likes to travel with the Queen. Since the outbreak of the European War, although he has been in and out of iron birds and bombs, this hobby has not diminished. Then the "most exquisite train in the world" will also follow the footsteps of the royal family and travel back and forth on the British Isles!

### A Week's Daily Menu

— Ms. Huaying

Hilsa herring has been on the market for many days; but it costs five or six corners per two, and it costs two or three yuan to eat such a small piece, so although I like to eat hilsa herring very much, my index finger is moving, but I still dare not ask for it, and I dare not put it on the menu. However, how can such a delicious seasonal product not have its place on the menu, so this Saturday, I will let it show its face and let people with broad economic power taste the new! There are only two ways to cook hilsa herring: steaming and braising; steaming is more fat and beautiful, and braising seems to be a little worse. However, it is best to add some ham slices to steaming, and wrap it with net oil, which costs more than braising. Let the eaters plan it themselves.

Monday: Mung Bean Sprouts with Shredded Pork, Sweet and Sour Yellow Croaker, Spinach with Tofu, Scallion Radish Shreds

Tuesday: Tomato Beef Soup, Stir-fried Silver Thread Eggs, Pickled Mustard Greens with Broad Beans, Toon Mixed with Tofu

### How Was Rice Hoarded Successfully?

— Reflections

In a small room.

Premier Wang reached into his cigarette case for a "Lucky Strike". Immediately, Vice Manager Li Shaomei, who was lying on the sofa opposite him, stood up and stepped forward to light a match and hold it out to Premier Wang. Premier Wang took a puff:

"Indeed, Shaomei, your words are insightful. If the US and Japan really go to war, the Saigon shipping..."

Vice Manager Li, with a face full of pride, picked up his teacher's words and said modestly, "It's not just my insight, sir. You must have seen it long ago. The price of rice at that time can be guaranteed... So, take advantage of..."

"Do we still have 30,000 bags in stock now?"

Vice Manager Li thought for a moment and replied:

"Well, about 30,000 bags."

Premier Wang held his chin in his palm, pondered for a moment, and said:

"Continuing to order 10,000 bags, how many hours of food is that really enough for in Shanghai? It definitely can't be considered much! But, in terms of finances... I think, perhaps we should first have them pick through and release a batch of last year's first-half goods... Oh, no, it's okay if they don't release them. When people are desperate for food, who will care about whether it's old or not?"

"Yes, yes!" Vice Manager Li gently patted his palm. "Sir, your words are absolutely right. If we release the old ones and then order new ones, wouldn't that be the same as not ordering at all?"

"But, in terms of fi-nan-ces." Premier Wang swiveled his majestic eyes, drawing out his words for a long time. It was indeed a difficult problem. You can't hoard goods without money, even if you know that everything will rise again. Therefore, Premier Wang also felt a little tricky. He hesitated and continued: "We've already overdrawn 500,000 from the XX Zhuang. Their foundation is small, with only 700,000 in capital. It seems embarrassing to ask again. As for the XX Bank, they mortgaged 10,000 bags to them, too... Although there are still more than ten others we deal with, we've almost maxed out our credit with them, and we don't really know them well. Either the XXX Bank has a large foundation, and I once gave them a favor, letting their runner have 1,000 bags of rice, or..."

Premier Wang stood up, gently patted his stomach with both hands, walked to the desk, picked up the phone, but put it down again, and said:

"Shaomei, please call for me. XXX, ask the Yu runner to answer the phone and ask him for 500,000 in funds."

Vice Manager Li connected the phone, his face beaming. After a while, he covered the receiver and said softly:

"Sir, he has readily agreed. Now their finances are rotten and they're suffering from having nowhere to put the money. He also said that for a rice shop like ours that makes money, let alone 600,000, they would be willing to lend 1,600,000."

"1,600,000? Shaomei!" Premier Wang took a step forward, his voice a little strange with excitement. "Tell him, if that's true, then agree to take his 1,600,000, for three months, the interest being no more than one point."

Vice Manager Li negotiated for a while and hung up the phone contentedly, saying:

"He has completely passed it through in front of their manager. Sir, do you mean to prepare to order 15,000 bags?"

Premier Wang shook his head!

"No, I want to order 20,000 bags. Depending on the situation, I may order 20,000 bags. Shaomei, call XX Zhuang again and see if they can move 500,000 as well?"

The phone was connected, but there were some hitches. Vice Manager Li covered the receiver and said softly:

"They have 300,000 in funds, which they are already preparing to use for a coal dust mortgage. If you want it, sir, they will refuse the other side."

"Agree to them."

"Isn't that still 200,000 short?"

"Shaomei, agree to them first, and the interest and term are the same as XXX."

Vice Manager Li hung up the phone:

"Sir, what about the remaining 200,000?"

Premier Wang replied with a smile:

"Third Concubine has a deposit at XX, 250,000. Transferring it out will also make her happy."

Premier Wang couldn't help laughing heartily, and Vice Manager Li happily laughed along.

### A Mother Teaches Her Child a Story

— By Xing

Near the small vegetable market, a shrewd, listless, disheveled old woman was sitting at the entrance of a narrow alley. A large, twelve- or thirteen-year-old, skinny, bare-chested child leaned in her arms.

"Mom! ... I ... am very ... hungry!" He said intermittently with a crying tone. But his mother seemed not to hear him, just staring blankly at the passers-by.

After a moment. Suddenly his mother said to him in a soft voice:

"In the basket of that 'bound feet' woman over there, there are several breads, go and grab them..." The child listened, rubbed his eyes, and immediately stood up and ran and jumped towards the direction his mother pointed. As he approached the woman with the twisted "bound feet," he tiptoed and first glanced into the basket, "Oh! A bread." He said silently, saliva dripping from the corners of his mouth. He had no intention of paying attention to the things in the basket. He just used a lightning-like movement to grab two breads from the basket and run away.

He originally wanted to grab all four breads in the basket, but he was timid, so he only grabbed two.

"Ah! ... You murderer! ... Two breads ... were ... snatched away by him." The woman with the twisted "bound feet" exclaimed in fright; immediately, the eyes of many passers-by were drawn to her, but no one helped her chase the bread-snatching child. Some even showed smiles, as if watching a funny comedy.

He "ran away" while stuffing a bread into his mouth, eating it mouthful by mouthful. He still had one bread left to take to his mother, who had been hungry for a long time!

### To the Maid Agency

— By Zhu Xun

The next morning, after receiving instructions from my mother, I had to go to the maid agency to find a maid.

With uneasy emotions, I walked into a shop filled with "girls" and "women," some chewing pancakes, some chatting idly. When they saw me walk in, dozens of pairs of eyes swept over me.

"Looking for a maid?" A plump proprietress came over to greet me. "Yes, I'm here to ask for a maid!"

"Listen to you pick! An older one? Or a younger one?"

There were tall and short, thin and fat people sitting on the stools! There were old and frail with bound feet, and there were young and well-dressed ones! I glanced at them: "There are only two people in my family, a mother and a son. I need someone who can buy groceries, wash clothes, and do rough work!"

"Did you hear that? Who wants to go?" The proprietress said playfully.

"The number of people is small, how is the salary?"

"People like that probably don't have any extra money! I wouldn't go just for a fixed wage!"

"Elder sister! Go and try it out. There are no children, no diapers to wash, and the number of people is small. You'd be a good fit."

After a round of deliberation among this group of unemployed people, they finally pushed out someone around forty years old. She said to me with a smile: "I'll go and try it out, okay!"

I happily agreed to her request, and she followed me home with her small package.

As soon as we arrived home, she saw my dilapidated bedroom and the dusty desk; she seemed to have suffered a great injustice. Without doing anything, she ran away immediately.

(8) Palpable Friendship

"Sorry, I'll take my leave first!" He said to the internist.

"He's probably going to the movies with that miss again, right?" Dr. Yan and the internist couldn't help but look at each other and smile. Everyone knew that Baldy loved to do this.

"Don't make fun of me!" Baldy was already walking out the door. "Be careful you get a knife in the face!" The internist stood up from the rattan chair and said humorously.

Just as the room was filled with laughter, the nurse surnamed Li, who had just left, rushed back, her face also showing an excited smile.

"Dr. Yan, this is great!" Her right hand was still holding the piece of paper. "The patient in room 17 was extremely happy when he saw this name, and repeatedly asked me to go and find him right away!..."

"It's a man!" The internist said cluelessly. In his mind, when a man is sick, the person he likes to see the most is always a certain woman; it must be the same when a woman is sick. Moreover, his experience as a doctor over the years seemed to confirm this ideal, so he was very surprised when he heard the nurse's words.

Dr. Yan didn't say anything, but took the piece of paper.

"Zhao Yukun, Old Danfeng Tea Garden, Xujie, Japanese Concession." He read softly. "Baldy was right, he doesn't look like an upper-class person. Okay! Go up there! Tell him we'll send someone to find him right away. Tell him to rest assured first, and we'll give him an answer sooner or later." These words were all specifically for the nurse.

Before the nurse could leave, the electric bell installed in the corridor outside was already ringing like thunder, pulled by Dr. Yan. (109)
