### US President Roosevelt Declares World Situation Increasingly Grave, Dictatorial Nations' Aggression Will Force US to Join War, Encourages Unity of Workers and Farmers to Defend Democracy

Reuters, Hyde Park, 31st – President Roosevelt (see photo) yesterday gathered five hundred neighbors at his villa here for the annual meeting of the Roosevelt Family Club. The President addressed the crowd, saying that the danger shaking the world has not yet passed, and may be more serious than at the end of August and the beginning of September 1939. However, we are still able to sit here peacefully, which is very gratifying. I believe we should all pray that we can say the same thing next year, he said.

United Press, Hyde Park, 31st – President Roosevelt declared yesterday that the danger of a world war now may be even more serious than when the war broke out. The President said that dictators are planning to conquer the world, including the Americas. He hopes that the United States can still maintain a neutral peace, but warned the nation that the decision of war and peace is not entirely in the hands of the United States. His remarks indicate that future aggression by dictatorial nations may force the United States to enter the war. It is reported that President Roosevelt made the speech to more than five hundred neighbors at the annual meeting of his family club. He read aloud a letter from an unknown female reporter, saying, "I know that the ambition to rule the world is so great that it includes the Americas." It is said that this female reporter is a shrewd traveler and observer.

Reuters, Hyde Park, 31st – President Roosevelt delivered a Labor Day speech last night, calling on the American people to reaffirm their noble determination, saying in essence that workers, farmers, and employers must unite and stand firm in order to thoroughly defend our democratic system. No labor, no sacrifice, is too much, so that our cherished freedom and traditions can flourish for the benefit of the world. Labor and management must now understand the importance of the continuous production of national defense supplies. The production of these weapons and materials is needed for our own protection, and also for countries that resist countries that destroy the freedom and happiness of free people everywhere. We Americans should commemorate this Labor Day of 1941 with the most thoughtful and solemn spirit ever seen in the fifty-four-year history of Labor Day, and make people all over the world understand the happiness of democracy and freedom. The American people today have the great responsibility of preserving this democracy. We should exert our abilities in labor and sacrifice, as our ancestors did. We Americans should each fulfill our duties with full loyalty to this ideology, and it is appropriate to reaffirm our determination to undertake the current work on this Labor Day. It is believed that the US President's remarks are a prelude to a more detailed statement on international events on Monday.

United Press, Washington, 31st – Most people believe that President Roosevelt's reply to Konoe will reaffirm the US government's fixed policy toward the world and the Pacific. Although the content of Konoe's letter has not been made public, it is believed to be an attempt to repair the old relationship and to negotiate with the United States to adjust the situation in the Pacific.

### Roosevelt-Nomura Talks Only Exploratory, Hull Says Not Yet at Negotiation Stage

United Press, Washington, 31st – Secretary of State Hull said at a press conference yesterday that President Roosevelt's talks with Ambassador Nomura were only exploratory and could not be considered to have reached the negotiation stage. Hull reiterated that these talks have not gone beyond the exploratory stage. Later, in answering another question, Hull said that such talks are of an ordinary nature. When asked whether the United States is informing China, Britain, and other relevant countries of the situation of the US-Japan talks, Hull said that he could not comment on this matter because the US-Japan talks are purely exploratory. Well-informed sources said that rumors that the United States and Japan have reached a "basic understanding" are obviously premature.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 31st – London officially announced yesterday that the US government is informing the British government of the progress of the US-Japan talks, but whether the British government has learned the content of Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's letter to US President Roosevelt, or whether its notification is limited to the talks between Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura and US President Roosevelt, has not been clarified.

International News Service, Washington, 31st – Washington sources indicate that Japan is currently seeking to persuade the United States to relax its severe economic retaliation measures. In return, Japan may agree not to take further acts of aggression and guarantee that it will not attack Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. It is believed that this is Japan's current goal, rather than a general solution to the Eastern question. To solve the Eastern question, the United States will have to demand that Japan withdraw its troops from China and Vietnam.

International News Service, Washington, 31st – The State Department is currently studying the special suggestions made in Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt to resolve the current Pacific disputes between the United States and Japan. However, the nature of the letter remains a mystery. Diplomatic circles in Washington believe that Japan is willing to make some small but important concessions in exchange for larger concessions from the United States. It is rumored that the US concessions include (1) restoring US-Japan trade, (2) relaxing the US freeze order, (3) the US, Britain, China, and the Dutch East Indies abandoning the encirclement of Japan, and (4) providing limited assistance to China and the Soviet Union through Haishenwai. It is believed that in exchange for the US concessions, Japan is willing to guarantee that it will not attack British, American, and Dutch East Indies interests in the South Pacific. It is rumored that Konoe's letter to Roosevelt has aroused great concern in distant countries. China and the Dutch East Indies are both afraid that if the United States shows any signs of appeasement toward Japan, the credibility of the democratic countries will be greatly damaged, and the safety of China, India, Thailand, and the Philippines will be seriously harmed.

Chinese Side Believes Japan is Pretending

Havas News Agency, Chongqing, 30th – Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt has aroused great attention here, and there is much speculation about its content. However, Washington reports that after Nomura presents the letter, it is expected that he will continue to hold talks with President Roosevelt, so its content must have accepted the strong warnings of the United States and Britain to some extent. Observers familiar with the Japanese situation said that Konoe is also obsessed with the so-called New Order in East Asia, and it is unthinkable for him to make a 180-degree turn to break away from the Axis and abandon aggression. Even if he recognizes the great determination of the United States and Britain and understands the urgency of the crisis, he is willing to do so, but the domestic political environment does not allow it. If he forces it, it may lead to political riots. Therefore, it is speculated that the content of the letter should be full of sophistry, and further use empty words to perfunctorily, in order to buy time to wait for changes in the European war and make more adequate preparations. However, it is feared that Britain and the United States will not allow him to do so, and it is also feared that his domestic extremists will not be as patient as Konoe. As for the government authorities, they have not yet expressed their opinions, but they firmly believe that even if the Roosevelt-Nomura talks achieve anything, they will never be based on sacrificing China.

Tokyo Officials Maintain Strict Silence

Reuters, Tokyo, 31st – According to Japanese official sources, Prime Minister Konoe's letter to US President Roosevelt is phrased broadly and does not detail the existing problems between the two countries. The main value of the letter lies in its posture, and there is no need to expect the US President to reply. When dealing with extremely delicate international events, Japan maintains its goals of resolving the war against China and establishing lasting peace in the Far East. The temporary cabinet meeting on Friday considered the first telegram from Ambassador Nomura regarding the talks with the US President. Those responsible are currently maintaining strict silence about the content of the cabinet meeting, only saying that it is not yet possible to predict what progress has been made in US-Japan relations. As for the ultimate trend of the situation, it remains to be seen by Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Toyoda. Observers believe that the Emperor's meeting with the Minister of the Army on the eve of Konoe's letter to the US President is very meaningful.

United Press, Tokyo, 31st – Japanese public opinion seems to believe that the British Embassy's announcement of the evacuation of British nationals is motivated by the desire to create another Far East crisis of terror, similar to the terror created mostly by the British side last spring. The reader's commentary clearly refers to the matter of Prime Minister Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt between the United States and Japan. The government is closely studying Nomura's report on his talks with President Roosevelt. Japan's future foreign policy may depend on this decisive negotiation. Government sources said that the Emperor is closely watching the developments. The content of President Roosevelt's reply to Konoe will be presented to the Emperor. At the same time, Japanese newspapers have stopped criticizing the United States in their commentaries. It is said that because there is a possibility of easing the tension between the United States and Japan, Germany frankly admits that Japan's foreign policy may be changing. German officials do not express optimism, but so far, the government's discussions remain strictly secret.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 31st – It was learned here this morning that Prime Minister Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt and detailed information on the international political situation will be discussed at a secret Japanese cabinet meeting this week. At that time, Konoe and Toyoda will present reports on this information.

Editorial

### Second Anniversary of the European War and Journalists' Day

Today, September 1st, marks the second anniversary of the outbreak of the European War, and also the second Chinese Journalists' Day. We are living in a time of great change and shoulder the responsibility of reporting. On this occasion, I would like to express my views and describe my own feelings.

Looking at the current world situation, it can be described as the most turbulent era in history in terms of scale and intensity of change. Since Germany invaded Poland on this day two years ago and the European War broke out, more than fifteen independent countries have been overthrown or lost their sovereignty, and more than twenty countries have been directly affected by the war. The three continents of Asia, Europe, and Africa are all battlefields. Almost no place on the vast land has escaped the impact of the calamities of war. In terms of the number of participating countries, it may not be as many as the previous European War, but the intensity of the changes, the breadth of the spread, and the complexity of the related factors, as well as the severity of the losses and consumption, have fully demonstrated the characteristics of modern warfare, far beyond any previous war. However, after two years of evolution, although there have been many dangers and misfortunes during the period, the anti-aggression united front among the great powers has been completed, which was previously only a dream. The war aims of the democratic countries have also been clarified, and their enlightened wisdom is rare in past international documents. The invaders are increasingly showing signs of decline, and it is difficult for them to continue. And those who first destroyed world peace with violence ten years ago are now trying to open up a stalemate through negotiations. Their sincerity is undoubtedly doubtful, but their predicament is obvious to all. These are all brand-new hopes that are gradually growing in the midst of chaos and darkness, which could not have been imagined at the beginning of the outbreak of the European War. But this does not mean that we should be optimistic about the situation and that the light is just around the corner. The recent meeting between Greece and Mexico, and the views it proclaimed, are diametrically opposed to the war aims announced by the democratic countries. They are still stubbornly adhering to their consistent illusion of conquest and control, and have no intention of repenting. It is likely that the more unfavorable their future encounters, the more eager they will be to succeed. President Roosevelt said the day before yesterday that the danger shaking the world has not yet passed, and may be more serious than at the beginning of the outbreak of the European War. This warning is something that the world must deeply remember.

Now, let me express my feelings about Journalists' Day. Newspapers are a reflection of the times and also a driving force of the times. Horace Greeley, the greatest newspaperman in the United States in the 19th century, once said: "The task of a newspaper is to lead, to continue to lead." Because today's world affairs are complex and multifaceted, people in the world often feel lost. The progress of society and the development of public wisdom depend on the opinion of the public, based on a far-sighted understanding and clear propositions, clarifying right and wrong, and leading the people, so that they can become a trend and open up a new path for the times, not only to report correct news. Therefore, the contribution and function of newspapers to mankind can sometimes be comparable to those of great politicians and inventors. Let us prove it with the facts of recent years: helping China is unanimously called for by friendly countries, and the policy of appeasement is also jointly criticized by fair public opinion. Until recently, the former has finally been realized concretely because of the implementation of the US Lend-Lease Act, and the latter no longer exists in international diplomacy. Although the reasons are different, we cannot deny that sound public opinion has won a major victory in this regard. Some of the measures taken by the British government during the war often rely on the correct views of newspapers and public opinion, and can often achieve the effect of enhancing functions and making up for shortcomings. However, it is also because newspaper practitioners are extremely sensitive in distinguishing between right and wrong, truth and falsehood, and have little room for hypocrisy. Therefore, they are deeply hated by those who commit aggression. In recent years, the violence has often been directed at the destruction of fair public opinion. In the occupied areas of Europe and Asia, the arduous struggle and touching experiences of journalists have been repeatedly reported in newspapers and by people. And in China, since the uprising to fight, the journalists who have unfortunately been martyred are the most numerous among the cultural people. The voices of freedom in Europe continue to come from the occupied countries under Nazi control. The journalists in some special areas of China are also overcoming all kinds of difficulties and risking their lives to firmly stand their ground and carry on the cause, one after another, to engage in the promotion of justice and the faithful reporting. Although the environment is difficult, and they have not been able to fulfill their ideals by even one-tenth, they have tried their best, and can perhaps plead innocent to their readers.

Today, the international situation is turbulent, and the task of journalists is even more important. We cannot know everything about the future, but we must do our best to fulfill our initial desire to serve the country and society. Such as how to suppress the strong and support justice, promote national consciousness, and guide the way of effort. In addition, the analysis of the future situation, the plan for post-war construction, and the maintenance of the welfare of the citizens and the implementation of social mutual assistance, as well as the cultivation of the spirit and the training of the will, are all the tasks that newspaper practitioners in this time and place should have, and also what we should encourage ourselves and each other on this Journalists' Day.

### Eden Delivers Speech, Elaborates on Post-War Order, Eliminates Concepts of Hegemony in the East and West, Adjusts International Economic Relations, Asks British People to Sacrifice to Win Victory

Reuters, London, 31st – British Foreign Secretary Eden (see photo) said in a speech in Coventry yesterday that the eight-point declaration issued at the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting has established the principles on which the post-war world will be built. This declaration is the charter of all free countries, and establishes the principle of equality for all countries, large and small. All concepts of hegemony and leadership areas, whether in the East or the West, are eliminated. The post-war world must have the cooperation of all of us. The meeting between the US President and the British Prime Minister in the Atlantic is not only a meeting between two great figures, nor is it only a connection between two great nations, nor is it only a way to defeat Nazism, but it is a declaration that we have both a war strategy and a peace plan. Europe and Germany now know that they must choose one of Hitler's new order and our new order. I said a few days ago that Britain's post-war policy towards Germany must have two goals: one is that Germany must be in a state where it cannot rise again to wage war and invade other countries, and the other is that Germany must not become a source of poison for its neighbors and the world due to economic bankruptcy. Today, I will go a step further and say that what is governed by these two basic principles should not only be limited to the post-war relations with Germany, but also extend to general international relations. This is the clear meaning of the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration: First, no country must be in a position to wage aggressive war against its neighbors; second, economic relations must be adjusted so that no country will lose its proper economic position in the future due to unilateral trade methods that are exclusively implemented. Because political or economic imbalance will eventually cause disturbances. Without international security, there can be no individual security, and it is impossible to seek freedom from lack, jobs for all, or a standard of living that does not fall. Without economic security in all countries, there can be no international security, because war and disturbances are mostly caused by lack and loss. International security and economic security, though one in name, are in fact inseparable. But if Britain and other free countries do not always pay attention to the demands of peace, we will never have international security and economic security. There is one thing that I think must be given full attention, that is, when the war ended in 1918, we all had the idea that we could live in peace from now on. But today, we are more aware that we must watch over and maintain this peace, just as we must strive to win this peace. I hope that in the current work, the young people in the country who have participated in the war should each fulfill their responsibilities, so that the mistakes of the past will not be seen again in the future. I may as well briefly describe the current situation. Compared with fifteen months ago, there is indeed something exciting. At that time, we did not dare to hope that our fate would change so much. But today, if we comfort each other without striving, we will make a big mistake. The future still requires great efforts, especially in production, because the final result will depend on it. I ask the audience to make more efforts and continue to make sacrifices.

Either victory or defeat, either freedom or slavery, choose one of the two. There is no other choice. Life and death are at stake, and sacrifice is indispensable, and this sacrifice will not be in vain, because today we have good reason to hope that a happier world will finally come. Eden then announced the progress of the organization of Polish troops in the Soviet Union, and finally praised the achievements of Prime Minister Churchill, saying that there is no one else but Churchill who can undertake this important responsibility with indomitable perseverance.

### Alexander Delivers Speech

United Press, Durham, England, 31st – Secretary of the Navy Alexander said in a speech yesterday that Britain has not won the war in the Atlantic, but the progress of the war has given him greater confidence in the maintenance and safety of Britain's supply lines. He also said that he believes that the war has now reached the most important and decisive state, so it is urgently necessary to increase the development of production in the remaining industrial areas in the country, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

### The Vichy Side Denies That French Troops Invaded Guangdong Province; Has Not Yet Received a Protest From the Chinese Government

Vichy: Responsible parties here claimed that regarding the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' announcement that French troops had invaded Shangyi, Guangdong Province, China, no report has been received here. According to a Chinese announcement, the incident occurred on August 4, and the Chinese government has protested to the French Embassy. However, no such protest has been received here. Although this incident occurred three weeks ago, France has not heard of it so far, and the Chinese government only announced it after the 25th, which is sufficient to prove that it was an ordinary local incident and not of important nature. There is absolutely no reason to say that the French side ordered an attack on Chinese territory. (30th Havas dispatch)

### The Chongqing Red Cross Society Was Damaged in the Bombing

Chongqing: Today, several batches of Japanese planes attacked Sichuan again. Residents of Chongqing were trapped in air-raid shelters for up to six hours. One of the batches bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing, while the rest flew over Chongqing and headed towards Chengdu. The courtyard where the Reuters office is located was subjected to concentrated bombing by Japanese planes today. A total of five bombs fell within a radius of ten yards. Although the building was severely damaged, it did not collapse. It has now been confirmed that many people were killed or injured when Japanese planes bombed the mountains on the south bank of the Yangtze River yesterday, but the exact number has not yet been announced. Although foreign property was damaged, fortunately there were no casualties. The Chinese Red Cross Hospital was severely damaged. (31st Reuters dispatch)

### Journey in the Southwest Skies (3) Hong Kong, Chongqing, Kunming, Lashio

Roy is thirty-five years old. There are seven other American pilots flying this route, about the same age, mostly from Texas and California. Another pilot, Kent, from Louisiana, was killed the day before his thirty-seventh birthday.

Kent was serving on the Kunming-Lashio route when he received a warning that Japanese planes were attacking Kunming. (This decision was the same as our return trip, taking off in the afternoon. China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes fly this route twice a week.) He landed at a temporary airport near Kunming, waiting for the Japanese planes to fly over this area. The temporary airport was already being bombed by five Japanese planes. There was no radio equipment there to warn Kent. After the Japanese planes dropped their bombs, they flew up into the clouds, preparing to leave. As the fifth Japanese plane followed the other four planes up, it discovered a CNAC plane preparing to land. It was a Douglas DC-2, clearly marked as a mail plane in Chinese and English, with large black characters painted on the silver wings and fuselage. The fifth Japanese plane followed the other four planes in a turn, passing through the clouds and diving down at the CNAC plane which was taxiing.

Kent was killed instantly, a bullet from a 20mm machine gun piercing his chest. He fell on the propeller. The co-pilot and radio operator climbed over the body to the cabin to notify the passengers to leave the plane quickly. They were too frightened to move, believing that this was a civilian airliner and that the plane itself was enough to protect them. The two men, a female flight attendant, and another passenger jumped out of the plane. The Chinese co-pilot and radio operator jumped to the ground and rolled out of the range of gunfire.

They saw the female flight attendant escaping from the plane. Her white nurse's uniform should have been very conspicuous on the dusty brown airfield. One of the Japanese planes also saw her and swooped down. She ran out of the plane, trying to hide under the trees, but a bullet hit her leg halfway there. After the Japanese plane circled up, it came back and fired two more shots. The young woman died eight hours after being injured, before she could be taken to the hospital. She was 25 years old, petite and beautiful, and had intended to resign from her job after this flight and live with her young husband, who was an engineer in Chongqing. The passenger who got off the plane with the three managed to crawl to safety after an attack. The co-pilot and radio operator either hadn't been killed or had escaped elsewhere; their whereabouts were unclear.

The other eleven passengers in the plane were machine-gunned and shot dead before they could leave the plane. CNAC stopped using female flight attendants after mid-April. If this accident hadn't happened, this female service wouldn't have been interrupted.

A Chinese friend said that those CNAC pilots are deeply in love with flying. This is true. They love flying, and flying here is different from flying in the United States. Everything is decided by themselves, and they are free people in the air. They earn a salary of one thousand yuan per month, but many people believe that the dangers of the journey cannot be compensated for by one thousand yuan. Some of them grew up in China. There are many foreigners in China who cannot leave, and when they find this country lovable, they start working for China. Therefore, this salary includes all hardships and dangers. As long as this job exists, they will never leave. During the war, it seemed that they had signed a contract. In January, they flew for 85 hours. In their spare time, they went to the movies and attended European-style banquets. One of them built small boats himself, and another was an amateur photographer. The town has good bars, but you can't drink too much. They don't value life very much. Three of them are married, one wife has returned to the United States, and the other two are about to return home.

We left Kunming at 6:30 in the morning, and the surrounding clouds were like white foam spewing out of a volcano. Passengers who weren't feeling sick were dozing off. Everyone considered this kind of weather the best for flying. In Chongqing, the passengers on our plane included a representative of President Roosevelt, three senior Chinese generals, and a US military attaché. This was a group of very important passengers. We had to wait for the weather to deteriorate before flying to Hong Kong, or we would have to plan to pass through the Japanese-occupied area in the dark. Every three days, this plane had to fly twice the distance from Chicago to San Francisco. This is an extraordinary journey, and since 1928, there have always been two such flights every week. From the Sino-Japanese War to the present, CNAC has flown a total of 12,090 miles per week, with only 37 accidents. Only two passengers were killed in total.

The China National Aviation Corporation is organized in accordance with Chinese law and specializes in transporting passengers, mail, and goods to and from various parts of China. For everyone, this is China's third lifeline. The Burma Road is 1,400 miles long, leading from Lashio to Chongqing, and passes through winding mountain roads. Not counting accidents, it takes a week for trucks to transport heavy goods. The Sino-Soviet highway is 2,700 miles long in China, and trucks carrying aircraft parts and ammunition must bring their own gasoline, which takes at least six weeks. CNAC makes the round trip between the capital of Free China and the outside world in just three hours, so it is China's lifeline for ideas, money, and mail: the government cannot function without these three things.

Ten million legal tender dollars printed in England and the United States are flown to Chongqing every night, and the Red Cross's medical supplies are also flown in, while tungsten ore is shipped out to the United States to repay part of China's debt. Diplomatic documents are also transported by plane, such as reports from ambassadors of various countries and instructions from the Chinese government to overseas envoys. When Madame Chiang or ministers of various departments go to Hong Kong, CNAC flies them out. When envoys from various countries come to Chongqing to take up new posts, they also come by CNAC. This shortest route in China is managed by five American planes and eight pilots.

Although the weather is bad, the mountains are obstructive, there are no temporary airports for emergencies, no aviation signals, no very accurate weather reports, no de-icing equipment, etc., and although there is the possibility of being attacked by Japanese planes on the way, they continue to fly. It is no exaggeration to say that they are flying on the most dangerous commercial route in the world. Three hundred and fifty staff members, including clerks, airport workers, mechanics, radio operators, and pilots, are unanimously doing a great job for China. They have a strong and unyielding will, they will always continue to work, and no one can stop them. The Chinese know the value of CNAC. The Chinese are able to respect Americans, probably because on a route that is impossible to fly, there are American pilots willing to fly five silver planes for them. A China National Aviation Corporation flight attendant answers passenger inquiries about flights. This flight attendant, Miss Lu Meiyi, died near Kunming.

A CNAC plane landed badly, its nose plunging into the mud.

### Battles Around Odessa Continue Fiercely; Red Army Counterattacks at Novgorod,阻遏 Germany's Advance on Leningrad

Reuters, Moscow, 31st - Recent Soviet communiqués remain brief, stating only that fierce battles continued along the entire front on Saturday and Sunday, and that 66 enemy aircraft were shot down on August 27th.

Reuters, London, 31st - A dispatch from Moscow states that heavy fighting is ongoing around Odessa. German bombers attack the city daily, but the city has combat troops and anti-aircraft guns for defense, and the enemy aircraft have not achieved much effect. Enemy shells once landed in the city center, killing and injuring many women and children, their purpose obviously being to disrupt morale. However, Soviet aircraft quickly detected the enemy's artillery positions and destroyed them. The enemy aircraft's bombing is indiscriminate; factories and military zones have not been damaged, but one hospital and one theater have been hit, and some shells have struck civilian residences. All women and children needed for our defense are being evacuated to other locations under the protection of the Black Sea Soviet Fleet. However, the military and civilians alike show no sign of relaxing their determination to defend the city to the end. Two armored trains recently built by workers in the city are now in battle, successfully attacking German-held positions.

German forces are attempting to advance on Leningrad through the marshes to the north, but are encountering strong resistance everywhere, suffering heavy losses. Within the defense lines of the university city, there is extreme tranquility. Streetcars operate as usual from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM, restaurants are open for business, and the university is holding classes as usual after the summer vacation, with approximately 3,500 students enrolled. The school buildings are a thousand years old, and this year there are 700 new students. The continuation of studies shows the Soviet people's determination to resist to the end. At the same time, most residents are piling up obstacles everywhere under the guidance of military engineers, and building artillery and machine gun positions in the suburbs. Factories are repairing military vehicles and manufacturing war materials. Hitler's third offensive has gained nothing except for capturing some now-useless factories. According to Reuters' military correspondent, there is no definite news from the Gomel area, but according to recent war reports, the German forces have not made rapid progress in that area. The German goal is to cut off Kiev's communications. Even if the German claim of capturing Tallinn is true, it will not significantly impede Leningrad or hinder the operations of Soviet warships in the Gulf of Finland. However, the Soviet base at Hango will be more difficult to maintain. Currently, Soviet forces are counterattacking at Novgorod. If this move is successful, the Soviet forces will penetrate deep into the German forces in Latvia and Estonia, not only hindering the German advance on Leningrad but also putting the German army in a dangerous situation.

Reuters, London, 31st - Moscow Radio last night claimed that the enemy's price for capturing Gomel was over 80,000 soldiers killed or wounded, the loss of 200 tanks, hundreds of artillery pieces, thousands of motor vehicles, and hundreds of aircraft.

United Press, New York, 31st - British Wireless reported last night that Marshal Timoshenko's troops, after fiercely counterattacking along the front line, broke through the German defenses near Gomel.

German Military Spokesman Admits Difficulties Encountered in Attacking Leningrad

Reuters, London, 31st - A German radio military spokesman last night admitted the difficulties encountered by German forces on the Leningrad front, saying that in the past half-month, German forces, when fighting General Voroshilov's troops, not only encountered stubborn resistance but also had to cope with difficult terrain and heavily fortified defenses.

German Forces Advance South of the Dnieper River, Apparently Aiming to Occupy the City of Kakobov

United Press, London, 31st - The Soviet Union made no statements yesterday regarding the fighting in the Gomel region. It is widely believed that this indicates that although the Soviet advance is extremely slow, the area is still continuing to be developed. Authoritative sources said that the important battle south of Gomel is still inconclusive. The German attack here appears to be aimed at capturing Kakobov and destroying transportation east of the Dnieper River. Authoritative circles also stated that battles are fierce along the entire German-Soviet front. The Soviet Union is conducting small counterattacks in the north. German troops reportedly occupied Tallinn and Baltiyskiy. Authoritative circles stated that if this rumor is true, then the Soviet troops in Hango will have difficulty maintaining their stronghold because they will be subject to German flank attacks. Tallinn and Baltiyskiy could both serve as important bases for the German navy.

Soviet Union Denies the Fall of Tallinn; Military and Civilians Cooperate in Battle in That City

United Press, Moscow, 31st - A brief report last night stated that battles were fierce along the entire German-Soviet front, but did not indicate any changes in military positions. The report denied that German forces had occupied Tallinn and Baltiyskiy or the port of Oranienbaum. A special report from Tallinn stated that the city is still in Soviet hands and has repelled enemy troops. Leningrad continues to be attacked from the directions of Kingisepp, Volosovo, and Keksgolm. German forces have not made any progress anywhere in the past two days. News from Tallinn on Friday night detailed the situation of mobilizing to the last person, stating, "Everyone has resolved to die rather than let the city fall to the fascists." The news stated that men, women, and children are all willing to sacrifice themselves and work hard to help the Red Army and the fleet annihilate the enemy. Officials here stated that German forces attempted to set fire to the forests outside Moscow but were stopped by schoolchildren. Officials also stated that Leningrad is fighting for its life. Students are doing desk work for the soldiers and other guard duties, so the guards can continue to serve on duty day and night.

Finnish Communiqué States Soviet Troops Defending Vyborg, Every Street and House Fortified

United Press, Helsinki, 31st - The public here was extremely jubilant yesterday upon learning of the capture of Vyborg. Their pride was further boosted by reading the official announcement of the capture of Vyborg, as the capture has allowed Finland to recover most of the territory lost to the Soviet Union last year, the area being less than 20 kilometers from the old Finnish border. Vyborg was captured after a week of bloody battles, during which Soviet troops fortified every street and house in the city. Firing battles with machine guns and rifles took place from rooftops and in the middle of streets. Mines were laid under every building. Although Vyborg has not been completely reduced to rubble, it is riddled with holes and heavily damaged. The captured military supplies obtained by the Finnish army are said to be extremely large in quantity. According to yesterday's official communiqué, Finnish forces continued to advance after reaching the central front line of the Vuoksi River and have occupied Boulakoula, Alaempi, Ainavirvi, and Enkeli. Soviet forces resisted along the entire line west of the Vuoksi River but were ultimately defeated by the Finnish army, which then re-entered Vyborg and its surrounding areas. The city was surrounded by Finnish troops, and some even crossed into Vyborg. The Finnish encirclement of the city was further tightened. Soviet troops fought desperately and attempted to break out, but failed. The trapped Soviet troops included the entire 43rd Division and 115th Division, part of the 133rd Division, and some other units. On the morning of August 30th, Finnish troops entered Vyborg, while simultaneously forming a very deep wedge in the central part of the isthmus.

Hitler Congratulates Finnish President by Telegram; Finland Denies Talk of Peace Negotiations

Reuters, Berlin, 31st - Hitler sent a telegram to the Finnish President and the Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army, congratulating them on the capture of Vyborg and saying that he would award the Iron Cross to General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army.

Reuters, Stockholm, 31st - Finnish sources deny rumors that Finland is preparing for peace negotiations. However, the Finnish newspaper Savon Sanomat states that as far as Finland is concerned, military actions may cease because Soviet troops have withdrawn from the old Finnish border.

United Press, Simla, 31st - A public announcement made here yesterday stated, "According to news from the Anglo-Soviet front in Iran, resistance in all areas has ceased. The areas occupied by our forces have quickly returned to normal." It also stated that Iran is extremely peaceful, and the British expatriates in the city have not been disturbed in any way.

Agence Havas, Tehran, 30th - It has been learned that a group of Soviet bombers bombed the city of Qazvin yesterday. The gasoline tanks belonging to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company there were also destroyed, resulting in the loss of thousands of gallons of gasoline.

Reuters, Istanbul, 31st - Thirteen stateless women and one man, traveling for five days from the Iranian capital, arrived here this morning. Including this group, there have been a total of forty-one Germans approved to leave Iran this week. They are extremely concerned about the hundreds of German men still in Iran because the route of withdrawal has now been blocked. However, they believe that the British and Soviet military authorities will allow innocent women and children to leave the country safely.

Agence Havas, London, 30th - It has been learned that one of the conditions that Britain and the Soviet Union have put forward for resolving the Iranian issue stipulates that the country should provide guarantees to protect the oil wells of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and all national highways within its borders so that the Soviet Union can continuously receive overseas supplies through these roads. As for expelling German workers from the country, both Britain and the Soviet Union will also demand this. It can be asserted that the claim that the British military occupies the entire territory of Iran, or at least all its strategic points, has not yet been confirmed.

Iranian Oil Tax

Can Still be Collected. United Press, London, 31st - Reliable sources said yesterday that the conditions of the United Kingdom to Iran may be proposed today. These conditions may include a guarantee that the King of Iran may levy oil taxes.

### British and Soviet Troops Meet in Iran; Rumors of Iranian Army Demobilization; All Resistance Ceases

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 31st - According to reports from Tehran, the British and Soviet troops invading Iran are advancing rapidly. The troops of the two countries met at east of Lake Urmia on Friday afternoon. The Turkish border is guarded by British and Turkish troops respectively.

Agence Havas, London, 31st - According to reliable sources here, the Soviet troops that entered Iran are now only 80 miles away from Tehran, the capital of Iran. Meanwhile, according to news from the Turkish capital, the situation in Tehran is extremely tense, and the authorities there have decided to implement martial law.

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 31st - According to reports received here from Tehran, the new Iranian government has ordered the demobilization of the Iranian army. This matter is being supervised by the British and Soviet military commissions, and a large portion of the Iranian army will be disarmed.

### Laval's Condition Not Yet Out of Danger

Reuters, Vichy, 31st - According to yesterday night's communiqué, Laval's condition continues to improve. The German Ambassador Abetz and his wife visited Dieter in the hospital last night. His condition is reportedly good, but visitors are not allowed to enter. Laval was shot in the lung, but not in a vital spot, so there is no danger. Although his temperature is still high, the feared bronchial pneumonia has not occurred. Doctors hope to be able to treat it. A Vichy dispatch from the Swiss Basler Zeitung states that the bullet inside Laval's body is only one centimeter away from his heart and cannot be removed. It will be several days before we know for sure. Laval is 58 years old and not very strong. Dieter is stronger, but his injuries are more severe. Both have high temperatures, and it is uncertain whether they can escape danger. The trial of the assassin Colette is underway and has not yet resulted in a verdict. Many Swiss and French newspapers see this assassination as a symbol of a coming storm. The French newspaper Débats states that, based on history, assassinations are often the precursor to general unrest that can turn into a prairie fire.

International News Service, Vichy, 31st - Eight spies and communists, including a French Navy lieutenant commander, were executed in Paris yesterday. Paris newspapers stated that the assassin Colette claimed that he was not instructed by anyone and that the assassination of Laval was entirely his own idea. Laval's condition has worsened, and it is rumored that he is dying.

### Axis Powers Plot to Eliminate British and American Influence in Europe; Goebbels Rants in the Newspapers, Saying All Soviet Territory in Europe Must Be Occupied

United Press, Berlin, 31st - Authoritative sources here said yesterday that Mussolini and Hitler, at their recent meeting on the Eastern Front, discussed how to eliminate British and American influence in Europe. This is one of the main points that the two leaders decided on in the Axis powers' program.

United Press, Rome, 31st - Goebbels said in the Italian newspapers yesterday that Hitler and Mussolini, at their recent meeting on the Eastern Front, decided that the war against the Soviet Union would end at the Ural Mountains. The Soviet Union in Asia would not be invaded. Goebbels stated that the Axis powers and their allies would occupy all of the Soviet Union in Europe.

TASS, Geneva, 31st - According to well-informed sources, Mussolini and Hitler discussed the Hungarian-Romanian relations during their meeting because the relationship between the two countries has worsened German-Italian relations. This is because Hungary is trying to expel the Romanians from northern Transylvania. Italy supports all of Hungary's demands. Italy not only agrees to Hungary expelling the Romanians from northern Transylvania, but also promised to give southern Transylvania and an area of Yugoslavia to the Hungarians, but Hungary must abandon its claim to Fiume as a condition of the exchange. In fact, the steps taken by Italy have not been approved by Germany, and there is a possibility that Italian-German relations will once again turn sour. It is speculated by various parties that Germany supports Romania against Hungary.

### A Sketch of Three Key Figures in the British Cabinet

Bevin never intended to serve as a Member of Parliament. He could have been elected as a member at any time in the past twenty years, but he preferred to keep a low profile, serving as the General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union. He disliked publicity, and even within the labor movement, he was unwilling to be close to the masses. Therefore, he was respected for his outstanding talent, possessed power, but was not popularly admired.

However, the very qualities that once made him unpopular transformed into virtues when he became Minister of Labour in the wartime cabinet. He forcefully rejected mediocrity and incompetence, showing no leniency. His strong temperament and serious demeanor were enough to reflect the determination of the workers. His hoarse voice and blunt language had made him one of the most effective broadcasters in the government. In times of crisis, people often feel uneasy hearing gentle voices and stale tunes. Speeches like Bevin's, concise and comprehensive, using language familiar to the people, resonated widely.

In 1920, he was already a union leader when he first fought against Churchill. At that time, Churchill advocated war against Russia, but the Action Committee opposed and stopped it. Now, the two key figures who are working together to save Britain were once political rivals!

Because the Labour Party is controlled by the unions, and the unions are controlled by Bevin, Bevin, although not a politician, wields great political power. However, despite devoting his life to the labor movement, few truly know Bevin. He certainly has a few close friends in the unions, but in the Labour Party, he is known but not famous. He is a superior figure, making him prone to arrogance. His strong personality, his control over the union masses, his logical critical abilities, and his ability to sway emotions make him one of the most formidable figures in the labor world.

The establishment of the Transport and General Workers' Union is largely due to Bevin's efforts, and his role as General Secretary has also given him tremendous power. Using the dockworkers' union as a foundation, he merged thirty-six small unions of similar nature into the General Workers' Union. He organized the union with perseverance. Today, the Transport and General Workers' Union has more than 650,000 members, making it the largest union in the world.

Yet, he is a union leader who dislikes strikes. He prefers long-term negotiations to reach a satisfactory solution, preferring compromise to coercion. This may be due to the disastrous defeat of the General Strike of 1926. In 1937, when King George VI held his coronation ceremony, London bus workers went on strike demanding improved treatment. Bevin refused to recognize the strike, refused to pay wages during the strike, and denounced the move as incited by the communists. He fought his own workers with harsh measures, and after four weeks, when the workers were forced to abandon the strike, he expelled the strike leaders from the union.

Bevin, once regarded as a powerful leader of the left wing in the labor movement, has now become the sworn enemy of the left wing. In recent years, it has often been said that Bevin is a dictator in the union movement, and anyone who dares to obstruct him will be dealt with mercilessly. Young workers complain that his early enthusiasm has changed to prudence and caution. Having built the world's largest union and seeing the great improvement in workers' treatment, he is satisfied with his life's work and unwilling to fight for them anymore.

However, there is no doubt that he will continue to fight to defend the labor movement he has painstakingly created. They know that his hatred of fascists is sincere. They know that he considers fascists to be the greatest enemy of the unions. He recently said, "A worker who can skillfully control a Spitfire can also skillfully manage a home." This shows that he has not forgotten his true self. Therefore, in July 1940, when he accepted unprecedented power in Britain, he was deeply trusted by the workers. He was appointed Minister of Labour, with full authority to manage the work of the nation. He has the power to decide which industries are essential and which are redundant for the war effort. He has the power to regulate working hours and workers' wages. He transferred tens of thousands of workers from ordinary industries to military industries. He frankly told the capitalists that wages should not be reduced, and also frankly told the workers that their responsibilities were no less than those of soldiers, and that they must see themselves as industrial soldiers.

He is determined not only to defeat Germany but also to transform Britain. Last October, in Bristol, he said, "The society that is finally established should be based on the broadest foundations. All the privileges we have known will henceforth be combined and reduced to nothing." In London in mid-October, he said, "Things can never be the same as before. The old era is over, and a new era must be built."

As for the gentle and smiling Herbert Morrison, he stands in stark contrast to the somber and serious Bevin. Morrison is the only person in the labor movement known by his Christian name. Even British men and women who have never met him often talk about this "Herbert." Even those who are indifferent to the labor movement will not ask, "Who is Herbert?" The most obscure members of the Labour Party feel a deep connection with him. The workers of London regard him as a friend. When he walks on the streets of London, policemen, newsboys, shop girls, and truck drivers shout, "Hello, Herbert!" This Herbert, hatless, carrying a briefcase, hurrying along, smiles and waves back with a twinkle in his one eye.

When London was devastated by air raids, civilian morale became an important issue in the war effort, and air raid shelters could not be built hastily. But if the post of minister responsible for air defense were given to a figure widely admired by the people of London, morale would be greatly boosted. Herbert Morrison was transferred from Minister of Supply to Minister of Home Security, a daunting task that only he could handle. Because the Minister of Home Security is indeed one of the three most important posts in the wartime cabinet. Residents of London's East End, crowded into temporary air raid shelters, celebrated, saying, "With Herbert there, things will be alright."

This man, responsible for maintaining complex systems such as water, electricity, gas, sewers, and food supplies, as well as extinguishing incendiary bombs, removing time bombs, demolishing damaged houses, supporting remaining buildings, rescuing the wounded and comforting victims, and building air raid shelters for eight million people, is the son of a policeman and a maid.

He was elected to Parliament in 1922, lost his seat a year later, and won again in the general election of 1929, remaining in Parliament to this day. He served as Minister of Transport in MacDonald's Labour government, and after a two-month stint as Lord President of the Council, he entered the cabinet as the youngest member. (To be continued) Mr. and Mrs. Bevin and their daughter.

### Black Market Foreign Exchange About to Disappear, Legal Tender Value Strengthens, All Essential Goods to Be Settled with Foreign Exchange, Equalization Fund to Convene Meeting to Decide Everything

Since the Equalization Fund began managing the Shanghai exchange market on the 18th of last month, and even more so after the black market listing was cancelled on the 29th, speculative activities in the black market have suffered a fatal blow and are expected to disappear soon. Moreover, the import of essential goods can be settled at a more favorable exchange rate. People's hearts have been cheered in recent days, and the price of legal tender has risen as black marketeers hold long positions. This has also been deeply felt on the Japanese side. It is expected that after the Hong Kong meeting, the loopholes in the freezing order will be completely blocked, so as to realize China's expected goal of economic warfare against Japan.

Legal Tender Value Will Continue to Rise According to the Japanese-language Riku Shinpo, in order to eliminate the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai, foreign banks in Shanghai will, according to the instructions of the Equalization Fund, stop all black market foreign exchange transactions from the 29th. By the 30th, because foreign banks still refused to trade, the price loosened slightly compared to the previous day. Later, as the international situation improved, the price rose again. The exchange rate for British pounds was 2 shillings 8.90625 pence, and for US dollars it was 4.96875 yuan, approaching the 3 shilling and 5 yuan marks. It is rumored that the Equalization Fund, in order to crack down on the Shanghai black market and control foreign exchange, will, when necessary, raise the current official exchange rate of 3 shillings 1.5625 pence against British pounds to 3 shillings 5 pence. This rumor was widely spread for a time, so it had a great reaction in the market. According to observations from the banking sector, the suspension of foreign exchange transactions by foreign banks does have a tendency to reduce the black market. Therefore, the legal tender seems to be on the rise. The call loan market on the 29th was temporarily suspended due to this influence.

Equalization Fund Meeting Will Still Be Held The second plenary meeting of the Equalization Fund will be held in Hong Kong.

Although the official date of the meeting has not been announced, judging from Mr. Chen Guangfu's statement that "the work of the Equalization Fund will be reported in the newspapers early next week," the results will undoubtedly be known within three or four days. The most important decision of the meeting will be the supply of new foreign exchange at new prices, strictly limited to the essential goods approved by the Executive Yuan. In addition, the freezing of Chinese funds will be tightened to prevent speculation in the black market.

Pastor Hertzberg presided over the prayer service. At 10 o'clock, the participants arrived one after another. In addition to over a hundred Dutch residents, there were also over a hundred British and American residents, as well as more than ten Chinese people. The flags of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom were hung in the center of the hall. The ceremony was solemn and respectful. After the ceremony ended at 12 o'clock, Pastor Hertzberg gave a speech saying, "We pray that God in heaven, according to His merciful will, will keep our Queen healthy, so that the Dutch people can live and work in peace and contentment.

### Japanese Intellectuals Hope to Avoid Conflict with the United States, The United States Argues That Japanese Troops Should Withdraw from China, But Japan Believes It Concerns Face

The Chicago Tribune's Tokyo correspondent reported on the 30th that Prime Minister Konoe of Japan, through Nomura, sent a handwritten letter to President Roosevelt, confirming that Japan not only wants to avoid conflict with the United States, but also wants to reach a "friendly understanding" and end all frequently occurring tensions. The Japanese side believes that this kind of tension is not beneficial to either Japan or the United States. Although the content of the letter and Nomura's talks with President Roosevelt have not been published, the fact proves that the talks will have "good hope." The trend of the talks is at least "constructive" rather than "destructive." The Japanese believe that what the United States really needs is for Japanese troops to withdraw from China, but they hope that President Roosevelt can understand that Japan cannot afford to lose face in this matter. The Japanese believe that the current situation is very serious, but knowledgeable politicians in Japan are making every effort to avoid conflict with the United States. At the same time, there are signs of hope, as can be seen below: (1) Tokyo stocks have risen to a record high today; (2) Hull's statement that President Roosevelt's talks with Nomura caused Japanese bonds in London and New York to rise sharply; (3) It is generally said that Ottawa is determined to send Major General Rudes to be the ambassador to Tokyo, to fill the position that has been vacant for three years, but the Canadian Embassy here expresses great doubt about this appointment.

### Eight Hundred and Forty Foreign Nationals Evacuate from Japan to Shanghai, Including Twenty-Two Nationalities, with Jews Predominating, and American Officials and Soviet People Attracting the Most Attention

The Japanese mail ship Tatsuta Maru arrived in Shanghai from Japan at 7:40 PM on the 30th and docked at the Waitan Wharf. The ship carried a total of 840 passengers, including foreign nationals of twenty-two nationalities. Affected by the freezing order, they are evacuating from Japan to Shanghai with their 627 family members.

The passengers represent twenty-two nationalities. Among these passengers, there are 349 Jews, 61 Americans, 48 Indians, 48 Germans, 30 British, 20 Canadians, 14 French, 9 Swiss, and foreign nationals from Chile, Norway, Brazil, Hungary, Italy, the Soviet Union, Portugal, South America, Egypt, Poland, etc. The majority are merchants, while others are missionaries and professors. Notably, there are 27 American military attachés and consulate officials, and 5 Soviets, attracting significant attention from various parties. Except for the Jews, the British and American people will transfer to American ships in Shanghai to return to their respective countries.

The ship drifted at sea for five days off the coast of America. When the ship arrived in San Francisco on July 25th, it did not dare to enter the port due to the influence of the freezing order. It drifted in the ocean outside the port for as long as five days. Subsequently, as a result of the talks between Nomura and Hull, the ship was finally allowed to enter the port of San Francisco on the 30th. According to the captain of the ship, Takahata Toichi, the situation at the time was as follows: "Our ship had 205 passengers heading to the United States. Just as the United States issued a freezing order, in order to avoid being arrested by the navy, we changed our sailing direction and drifted in the sea 200 nautical miles outside the port of San Francisco."

Although the ship entered the port, the cargo was seized. At that time, the American side paid close attention to the whereabouts of our ship. Newspapers speculated on the direction of our ship every day, and various newspaper offices mobilized aircraft to investigate the ship's whereabouts. Subsequently, as a result of the talks between Nomura and Hull, our ship was allowed to enter the port of San Francisco. However, the US Customs used illegal means to detain the cargo carried by our ship. The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce launched a fierce opposition movement against this measure, and Jews, Chinese, communists, etc. were seen on cars making anti-Japanese propaganda when our ship was docked in San Francisco.

Vegetables spoiled, and passengers were poisoned. Takahata then spoke about the poisoning of passengers on the ship when it returned to Japan. It is said that after our ship arrived in Los Angeles on the afternoon of the 30th, all Japanese and foreign nationals except the Jews were scheduled to disembark. However, they encountered considerable obstacles due to inspections, etc. At the same time, the crew's disembarkation was also monitored and restricted. Food, drinking water, fuel, etc. on board had to be approved before being brought in. As a result, a portion of the vegetables spoiled, leading to passenger poisoning incidents. This occurred one day before returning to Kobe.

The Cafiero ship carried overseas Chinese leaving Shanghai. Most of the American overseas Chinese who evacuated from Japan to Shanghai are waiting in Shanghai for the American transport ship USS Henderson to return home. However, some had already booked passage on the President Cafiero through their relatives and friends here to return home. The ship set sail south from Shanghai at 4:30 AM this morning, via Hong Kong, Manila, Colombo, Mumbai, Ceuta, taking the Cape of Good Hope route and circling back to the United States via the Atlantic. The ship only carried 35 American overseas Chinese for evacuation and 1,600 bags of mail destined for the United States.

### Today is Journalists' Day

The Press Strongly Supports Rectitude; Joint Telegram Sent to Chairman Chiang Expressing Respect

Today is September 1st, Journalists' Day. The Shanghai journalists did not hold any celebrations, and the newspaper offices and news agencies worked as usual without taking a holiday. However, considering the importance of the responsibilities of journalists during this time of national crisis, they resolved to uphold the spirit of unwavering loyalty, adhere to their positions, and strive to fulfill their duties to the fullest. At noon today, all journalists in the city will stand up in place and observe three minutes of silence to deeply mourn their colleagues who died in support of national policy after the Shanghai war. At the same time, members of the press jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the soldiers at the front, expressing their respect.

### Japanese Erect Obstacles in West Shanghai

Guaranteeing Foreign Residents in the Hongqiao District, the Japanese Side Resolves Not to Emulate the Blockade of Tianjin

The Japanese side has imposed various traffic restrictions on Chinese people passing through the bridges in the Hongkou District north of the Suzhou Creek, which will be implemented indefinitely. Chinese drivers are not allowed to pass at any time. According to foreign sources, the Japanese side is still erecting barbed wire obstacles along Hongqiao and around St. John's University in the West Shanghai area. However, according to a letter received by the Hongqiao Foreign Residents Association, the Japanese side has resolved not to emulate Tianjin and restrict the food supply to foreign residents in Hongqiao, Shanghai. The Japanese side also stated that no changes will be made without sufficient prior notice.

### Edible Oil Prices Repeatedly Rise; Strict Price Limits Imposed; Severe Punishment for Any Violations

In view of the recent repeated rises in the price of edible oil, which is clearly due to manipulation by speculators, the French Concession authorities in this city have taken emergency measures with the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains, Oil, and Oil Cakes Trade Association, determining that the maximum market price for soybean oil in iron drums (measured by Sima weight) is 275 yuan per 100 catties, raw oil in iron drums (measured by Sima weight) is 272 yuan per 100 catties, and raw oil in bamboo baskets (measured by market weight) is 190 yuan per 100 catties. Any violations will be severely punished. It is also understood that according to recent investigations, the edible oil reserves are sufficient, and the supply has not been interrupted, so oil prices are expected to fall.

### Payments Begin for the National Salvation Bonds; Shanghai Agencies Handle Collections

In order to maintain the credit of national bonds, the Ministry of Finance has made timely payments of principal and interest on various public bonds issued during and before the war, and has never been overdue. If the designated tax revenues are insufficient to cover the payments, the Ministry of Finance will allocate funds from the national treasury to make up the difference, which are transferred to the Central Bank for special deposit in advance for payment. This has won the deep trust of bondholders. The issuance of new wartime bonds is particularly cautious in order to lighten the burden on the people. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications yesterday: (1) The eleventh installment of principal and interest on the 1936 National Recovery Bonds was originally scheduled to begin yesterday, but due to the regular Sunday holiday, it has been postponed to today, and will be paid by the Chongqing Central Bank. The Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have received telegrams from their head offices, instructing them to facilitate Shanghai bondholders by collecting payments on their behalf for transfer to the Chongqing head office. (2) For the first redemption of the 1933 National Salvation Bonds, the winning numbers are 312, 474, 691, and 935. Payments will be made by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank from August 31st. Due to the environment in Shanghai, payments will not be processed there for the time being. However, bondholders may entrust banks to collect payments from the four banks in Hong Kong, which will be paid in full in legal tender in one lump sum.

### New Twists in Labor Dispute at Four Major Hotels

The labor dispute at the Hua懋, Metropole and other four major hotels remains unresolved. The management representative, Mr. Li Pu Simen, insisted on dismissing a large number of employees, while the labor side consistently opposed it, resulting in a deadlock. In order to continue negotiations with the management, the labor side specially sent more than 20 representatives to the gates of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road and the Bund at 7:00 AM yesterday, intending to persuade the 100 or so room attendants who had not yet gone on strike to leave the hotel and join the strike immediately, in order to awaken the management and resolve the dispute as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, the management telegraphed the Public Concession Police, requesting that the police be dispatched to suppress them. After receiving the report, the police sent patrol cars to persuade the workers at the scene to disperse in order to quell the dispute. Although all the workers debated with the police, their actions were unavoidable, and they were eventually arrested. As for the 100 or so workers who had not yet gone on strike at the hotel, they left the hotel and went on strike separately after the incident. Therefore, the labor dispute at the four hotels has continued to deteriorate, and the future is difficult to predict. Currently, all the workers are actively planning to lodge a stronger protest with the management and hope for assistance from all sectors.

### Check for Over One Thousand Yuan Awaiting Collection

We hereby publicly announce its retrieval. Please have the person who lost it specify the amount on the check, the due date, and the stamp of the drawer, and come to our store's cashier to collect it. Cashier of Huadong Leather Shoe Store, August 30th.

### Zhu Shaoyun, a Famous Doctor for Scrofula

Zhu Shaoyun, a scrofula expert from Suzhou, at No. 3 Yongnian Lane, Baker Road, and his brother, Dr. Shaoqin, specialize in treating various types of scrofula and all kinds of external diseases. They have been practicing in Shanghai for more than 20 years and have cured countless people. Dr. Zhu's secretly made special scrofula pills and external ointment are sold by the four major companies. Double-dose boxes are 7 yuan each, and ointment jars are 1.60 yuan each.

### Publishing News

The New Stream Literature Series will be published. The first collection of the series, which is purely literary in nature, is scheduled to be published in mid-September. The contributors are well-known writers in the literary world, such as Zhu Wen, Luo Hong, Hu Shanyuan, Zhou Lengjia, Zhao Jingshen, Wen Zongshan, and Qian Jinxie, with novels and essays. It also reprints first-class literary works from the Chongqing literary world. It can be said to be the only literary publication in the publishing world recently. Readers, please pay attention.

The Shanghai Weekly is published. The Shanghai Weekly (Volume 4, Issue 10) was published the day before yesterday. The most eye-catching issues this week are the "US-Japan Negotiations" and the "Allied Forces Enter Iran." The newspaper has very insightful arguments and detailed analyses. It is truly a must-read for anyone concerned about current affairs. Other special articles are also written by famous writers. In addition, one translated manuscript is a recent work by Chiang Kai-shek's political advisor, Mr. Owen Lattimore, entitled "The United States Should Not Miss the Opportunity," which is a rare masterpiece. The number of pages in this issue has been increased, and each copy is still sold for 40 cents.

Practical and Simple Method for Calculating Foreign Exchange. Foreign exchange calculations are extremely complicated. There are several calculation tables published in the market, but it is still necessary to use multi-digit multiplication and division, which is very time-consuming with manual calculation, and also inconvenient with abacus calculation. Because Mr. Yang Du has long been engaged in calculation at the Commercial Press, he is skilled in calculating foreign exchange. He has been able to invent a novel method that replaces multiplication and division with addition and subtraction. Those who are used to using the abacus will find it very convenient. This method has now been compiled into a booklet and published, which is truly good news for people in the accounting industry. The price is two yuan per copy.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the Shandong area is surrounded by sky and clear weather, with gentle and undirectional winds. There is easterly wind between this area and Maan Island to the south. There are local showers in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The hurricane in the Pacific Ocean is clearly weakening and has a tendency to shift further to the west-northwest. The center of the hurricane was at 17 degrees north latitude and 129 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM, within 120 miles. The wind direction is west-northwest, and the wind force is unknown. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 82.9 degrees and the lowest was 68.0 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 87.3 degrees and the lowest was 75.9 degrees.

### Cheng Ji's Watercolors

— Chen

Cheng Ji has given people a deep impression since holding a solo exhibition of watercolors at the Da Xin Gallery last November. We cannot but say that he is a young artist who excites us and fills us with hope.

At the same time, he has aroused the unanimous goodwill and praise of international figures. Pierre Flogny, in the French magazine La Revue Nationale Chinoise, wrote a special article to introduce him, praising him as a new discovery in the dull painting world, a strong seedling growing in the painting world of the New China.

Although our country has launched a new cultural movement, emerging painting is still in the process of brewing, and has not yet established its proper foundation to this day, and most writers have a significant tendency towards the French style of painting. However, although Cheng Ji is also influenced by contemporary writers, he is not confined to the Western tradition, but creates his own unique style with his superb talent. His quiet and enthusiastic, gentle and tenacious personality is close to the unique style of the Chinese nation. In his paintings, we appreciate the gentle and quiet tones, filled with the charm of poetry and music, which gives people the comfort of absorbing a warm breeze in the cold of early spring, and is like listening to the sound of reeds in the vast wilderness, which is far away, melodious, and full of the vitality and hope of life, symbolizing the great future of the New China. His strokes are free and easy, concise, and the use of water is moist and bold, which is where his skills are refined. Moreover, he has expanded his vision, and although he is confined to the narrow territory of the "isolated island," he expresses Shanghai as the theme, and takes all the dynamics of society as the subject matter, to enrich the content of his paintings, revealing his rich creativity and production desire.

Now, he will hold a solo exhibition of nearly 160 recent works at the Da Xin Gallery, which will last for 10 days from September 1st to the 10th. I hereby write a few words to introduce him. (Chongqing News Agency)

### Shanghai's 880-Yard Swimming Competition, Ji Dixiu Creates a New Record, Takes Only Eleven Minutes and Fifty-Four and Six-Tenths Seconds

The finals of the Shanghai Open Swimming Championships were held on Saturday night at the Rowing Club. The most noteworthy of these was the men's 880-yard freestyle event. Ji Dixiu (formerly Jia), who had just won the 440-yard championship, led the way. When he finished swimming 440 yards, it took him only five minutes and twenty seconds, unofficially breaking the highest record for the 440-yard freestyle (five minutes and thirty-four seconds), and shortening it by as much as fourteen seconds. When two-thirds of the race had passed, Ji had already thrown off Stephen, who was in second place, by a hundred yards. As a result, Ji won the championship with a time of eleven minutes and fifty-four and six-tenths seconds, breaking Smith's Shanghai record of twelve minutes and five and six-tenths seconds in 1936, which is very commendable. Hai Jin defended his championship in the 100-yard freestyle, with a result of 59.8 seconds, which was not outstanding. Smith won the 100-yard backstroke, and Burt dominated the elementary 100-yard freestyle effortlessly. The final finals will be held this Saturday at the West Qing Swimming Pool. Registration closed yesterday. There are five events for men and women, with a total of 34 participants. Chinese general Wen Jingling participated in the men's 50-yard freestyle, Lin Meiling joined the women's 50-yard freestyle, and diving star Zai Anxiang participated in the men's fancy diving.

### Charity Basketball and Volleyball Tournament: Blue and White Win Championship

All-Blacks Team's Behavior Unsportsmanlike; Friendship Star Women's Volleyball Wins Championship

The charity basketball and volleyball tournament held by the Disaster Relief Children's Home commenced its fourth and final match yesterday at 5:00 PM at the Guoliang Middle School field on Avenue Edward VII. The first match was a battle for the volleyball championship between Friendship Star and Shanghai Star. The absence of Shanghai Star's main player, Zhuo Xianglai, impacted their strength. Although only eight players competed, they fought valiantly, posing a significant threat to Friendship Star. Ultimately, Friendship Star narrowly won 2-0, claiming the volleyball championship. After the match, a volleyball was auctioned off, with Huang Mingyuan of Friendship Star representing Ms. Xing Ruiqi, winning with a bid of 500 yuan. The basketball was also auctioned off, with Xie Yiqin representing Li Zulai, winning with a bid of 500 yuan. Yesterday's total proceeds amounted to 1,226 yuan, all of which were donated to the orphanage. In the basketball game, amidst enthusiastic cheers from the audience, Blue and White defeated All-Blacks 31-25, securing the basketball championship.

Exciting Match Abruptly Ends

After the start of the game, Blue and White took the lead, with Zude scoring the first basket, establishing a 6-2 lead. All-Blacks substituted Wang Jinghu for Dong Yangfeng, which proved effective, and Kong Guangyi's entry narrowed the score to 9-10. After a prolonged struggle, Blue and White narrowly led 14-11 at halftime. Resuming the game, Blue and White further extended their lead to 19-14. Shaoqing bravely led the charge, scoring two baskets, and Youliang also made a contribution, tying the score at 24-24. Blue and White called a timeout. Chen Bangzhen and Li Zude scored consecutive points through free throws, gaining six points. Blue and White's momentum surged. With only one minute and eight seconds remaining, several players from the All-Blacks team behaved improperly, surrounding Bao Songyuan of Blue and White and assaulting him, causing a major uproar. The exciting game ended abruptly, to much regret. Ultimately, Blue and White defeated All-Blacks 31-25, concluding the three-game series with three victories and winning the championship.

### The Impact of Prohibited Imports on the Shanghai Market

— Wang Haibo

Following the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, our country gradually adopted measures to manage trade. For example, the regulations regarding prohibited imports, upon which the Stabilization Fund relies when providing foreign exchange today, were promulgated and implemented on July 4th of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). However, due to Shanghai's unique circumstances, it became an isolated island after falling into enemy hands. All national laws and regulations enacted during the war could not be implemented in Shanghai. This loophole ultimately undermined the effectiveness of our country's entire wartime economic control mechanism.

Recently, the United States government, at our country's request, froze all US dollar funds belonging to Chinese citizens. To maintain China's reasonable foreign trade in the future, the supply and demand of US dollars will be handled centrally by designated banks (initially, the fourteen Allied banks in Shanghai and our country's three national banks, namely the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, were designated. After consultation between China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, it was changed to nine Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai designated by the Exchange Stabilization Fund). Initially, the US Treasury Department's freezing decree was extremely vague; the criteria for supplying exchange were extremely broad. As a result, each bank continued to supply exchange based on its own interpretation. At the same time, there was no unified supervisory body to regulate them. For a time, the steps taken by each bank were greatly confused, eventually forming a peculiar situation of freezing without actually freezing. The exchange market was agitated as a result, and speculation intensified; exchange rates became extremely tight, and special rates soared. Legitimate merchants and the entire society and people's livelihood suffered as a result. Subsequently, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom agreed on the future supply of foreign exchange. The task was still entrusted to the Sino-American-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, which was established earlier, to carry out stabilization operations and to be responsible for supervision. At the same time, the authority to unfreeze all Chinese funds in the United States was uniformly entrusted to the Central Bank of China. On the one hand, the Stabilization Fund designated nine banks to handle the legal supply of exchange, and clearly announced that all future exchange supplies must be handled in accordance with the regulations on prohibited imports promulgated in early July of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Exchange will not be supplied for goods that are prohibited from import. Even for free goods that can be imported, the import need must go through review procedures. Although there are currently no explicit regulations regarding the standards for this review, it is generally expected that they will be handled in accordance with the US Treasury Department's notes No. 58 and 59. The main points of these notes are two: (1) Only commercial enterprises that were genuinely engaged in business in China early on have the right to apply for foreign exchange supply. Impersonation and substitution are not allowed. (2) The amount of exchange applied for must be equal to the value of the imported goods. The exchange obtained through the application must not be used for other purposes.

With this adjustment, the scope of exchange supply and demand became clear, the criteria for reviewing supply and demand were determined, and the Sino-American-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee's unified supervision and effective balancing came into play. The chaotic situation in the current exchange market was thus clarified. In the future, the order of the exchange market should be restored, and exchange rates should be stabilized, so the wind of speculation can be contained. As a result, the doubts of the general public about the future of the exchange market can now be dispelled. However, because Shanghai has been exempt from the law for several years, and import trade has always been free, it will now have to be subject to the restrictions of the regulations on prohibited imports. Free imports that are not prohibited will also be subject to invisible management in the exchange application and supply system in the future. Therefore, they have all raised their deep concerns about the future of the Shanghai market. This is a common psychological change whenever a new policy is implemented and all parties are not yet clear about it. However, whether it is the case, and what the ultimate impact will be, is also worthy of our attention.

The Current State of Trade Management Since the outbreak of the war, our country's trade policy has undergone changes. Truly, balancing international payments is fundamental to a country's economy. However, during the hot period of the war, the situation varied at different times, and trade often tended towards a deficit. It is especially necessary to revise the direction at any time, maintain balance, so that it does not affect the social economy. Judging from the traces it has gone through, it can be roughly divided into four periods. Before the implementation of the foreign exchange review system in early March of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), import and export trade was purely free, but for military purposes, some ports were closed, or the export of certain goods was prohibited. This was the first period. Then, until July of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), due to the establishment of the foreign exchange review system, the government began to manage a small portion of import and export trade. Without application and approval, import and export were not allowed by law. This can be called the embryonic period of trade management. This was the second period. Since the promulgation of the "Regulations on Prohibited Import Goods During the Emergency Period" (which is now cited by the Stabilization Fund as the standard for reviewing foreign exchange applications) and the "Regulations on Applying for Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods," "Measures for Settling Exchange and Receiving Exchange Rate Differences for Exported Goods," etc., in July of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), until today, import and export trade has begun to enter the stage of restricting imports and encouraging exports. However, as mentioned earlier, due to the existence of the Shanghai free market, foreign exchange could be freely bought and sold, and import trade refused to be bound by national law. The war did not change Shanghai's dominant position in the national economy. On the contrary, due to the concentration of refugees and the concentration of floating capital, Shanghai's financial power expanded relatively; the changes in the local market had a particularly strong impact on the potential power of the whole country. The state's trade management law could not be implemented in Shanghai, so the elaborately planned trade management organization ultimately became a mere formality. Unfortunately, all control orders became empty words. This was the third period.

The failure of past trade management, like the failure of exchange control, was due to extremely complex reasons, but the lack of effective cooperation from the United Kingdom and the United States was undoubtedly one of the main reasons. Today, since the United Kingdom and the United States have successively cooperated with us in stabilizing exchange, and further agreed to the Chinese government's request to freeze Chinese funds and agree to use the above-mentioned "Regulations on Prohibited Import Goods" promulgated by China as the standard for determining exchange supply, the trade management organization arranged in the past should be able to see its effective implementation from now on. Although there are still many difficulties in its future. But in terms of the development of China's trade policy history, it is currently entering a period of strengthening, which is beyond doubt.

In terms of the current trade management system in our country, its main points are roughly four:

(1) All import and export trade must be carried out in accordance with the law, and private transactions are not allowed.

(2) For export trade, those designated by the government as state-owned should be state-owned. For privately operated businesses, they must first settle their export exchange with government banks. Otherwise, export is not allowed.

(3) For import trade, exchange will be denied for those prohibited from import by the government. All exchange needed by importers will be supplied by the nine banks designated by the Stabilization Fund. Before supply, procedures such as application and review must be carried out; once approved for supply, it can be sold at the exchange rate set by the Stabilization Fund.

(4) It is also forbidden to report for transit for goods that are prohibited from import. If adjusting the market price in the rear, or supplying for other uses, or there are other legitimate reasons, those who have been approved by government agencies may have the Ministry of Finance investigate and consider the actual needs, and issue a special permit to purchase and transport prohibited import goods, and then allow them to be imported.

It can be seen that our country's trade control is technically dominated by exchange management. That is, trade management is implemented through exchange management. Therefore, its success or failure still depends on whether the black market for foreign exchange can be eliminated. If the black market for foreign exchange is not eliminated, then imports that are not approved can still be sought in the black market. However, the import exchange rate obtained in the black market will be more expensive than that obtained in the legal market. Therefore, the import price will also be expensive. Although this method cannot make all import trade be handled entirely according to the government's intention. However, due to the impact of the black exchange price on its import price, it can invisibly achieve some inhibitory effect. As for those who directly impose trade control techniques on trade itself, only the implementation of the regulations on prohibited import goods is more noteworthy. Because all goods that are prohibited from import will not only be unable to obtain legal exchange in the future, but also will not be able to pass through customs. Even if the customs in the occupied area can pass, it will be impossible to transport it to the interior. For this reason, the market for all goods within the scope of prohibited import must be the first to be affected.

Goods Prohibited from Import The purpose of wartime trade management is, on the import side: (1) to shift non-urgent and unnecessary imports to wartime urgent imports; (2) to adjust international payments to ensure the stability of the currency's external purchasing power; (3) to cultivate the good habits of national thrift; (4) to exert the effect of economic warfare, to pressure the export trade of the opposing country; (5) to encourage the revitalization of the domestic substitute industry. In order to enrich the people's livelihood. The "Regulations on Prohibited Import Goods During the Emergency Period" promulgated in early July of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) were formulated in accordance with these meanings. The prohibited scope, as reported by various newspapers, is 16 categories. Checking its content, categories 5, 8, 13, and 15 are missing. The prohibited tariff item numbers, as reported by various newspapers, are 234 items. Checking its content, there are only 168 items. Tariff No. 624, tiles and bricks, were also originally listed as prohibited, but were removed during the amendment of the law; so there are actually only 167 items. If we analyze the types of these prohibited goods, they can be roughly divided into (1) luxury goods, or non-urgent and unnecessary goods; (2) goods for which the opposing country is the main importing country, and for which alternative goods can be found domestically or in a third country; (3) countries that do have substitute goods that can offset import needs. Starting with the purpose and nature of each item, the original table can be re-listed as:

(1) Cotton and its products: Prohibited Nos. 77 and 80.

(2) Hemp and its products: Prohibited No. 102, one type.

(3) Wool and its products: Prohibited Nos. 115, 116, 120, 122, 125, 126, six types.

(4) Silk and its products: Prohibited Nos. 129 to 145, eleven types.

(5) Fish, shellfish, and seafood: Prohibited Nos. 275 to 283, 286 to 287, 289 to 297, twenty types in total.

(6) Meat and food products: Prohibited Nos. 300, 302, 303, 314, 316, 318, 321, 328, 330, nine types in total.

(7) Fruits, dried fruits, and their products: Prohibited Nos. 299, 304, 312 to 313, 315, 317, 319, 329, 332, 333, 336, 351, 353 to 355, 360, 364, 366 to 371, 375 to 377, 379 to 382, 389, 392 to 394, thirty-four types in total.

(8) Sugar: Prohibited Nos. 398 to 401, three types in total.

(9) Wine and other beverages: Prohibited Nos. 403 to 419, seventeen types in total.

(10) Tobacco: Prohibited Nos. 420 to 425, five types in total.

(11) Mineral oils: Prohibited Nos. 520 and 532, two types in total.

(12) Paper: Prohibited Nos. 545 to 547, 549, 550, 554, and 557, seven types in total.

(13) Animal hides: Prohibited Nos. 566 to 568, three types in total.

(14) Feathers: Prohibited Nos. 572 to 573, two types in total.

(15) Animal bones and horns: Prohibited Nos. 574, 576, 579, three types in total.

(16) Wood and its products: Prohibited Nos. 589, 600 to 601, three types in total.

(17) Palm, bamboo, grass, and their products: Prohibited Nos. 592, 593, 595, 596, 598, five types in total.

(18) Porcelain and enameled porcelain: Prohibited Nos. 608 and 609, two types.

(19) Glass and its products: Prohibited Nos. 610 to 612, 614, 616, six types in total.

(20) Jewelry, ornaments, and cosmetics: Prohibited Nos. 627, 645, 650, 653, 655, 658, 667, seven types in total.

(21) Antiques, works of art, and decorations: Prohibited Nos. 633, 634, 635, 671, four types in total.

(22) Musical instruments and toys: Prohibited Nos. 641, 652, 668, three types in total.

(23) Sundries: Prohibited Nos. 638, 666, 669, 670, four types in total.

Looking at the prohibited goods, they are either non-urgent and unnecessary, or they are the main products of the opposing country, or there are domestic substitutes. If they can be effectively prohibited, then based on the actual import situation in the 27th year of the Republic (1938), it is estimated that more than 230 million yuan can be saved, which is equivalent to about 68 million US dollars and 13 million British pounds. Once this huge amount of foreign exchange expenditure is saved, it can be transferred to the import of urgently needed materials. For our country, it is only a change in the use of foreign exchange; for other countries, it is only a conversion of their exported goods; in essence, the statistics on their trade with China will not be affected. However, the great impact on Shanghai's consumer market is worthy of attention.

Prohibition and Shanghai Commerce The annual import volume of the 167 tariff items that are currently prohibited from import has always been Shanghai as its largest consumer port. Although the commodity numbers in the monthly trade statistics published by the customs are different from the tariff numbers, using their specially compiled statistical numbers, it is not easy to calculate the most recent trade volume imported into Shanghai. However, by using the tariff numbers and statistical numbers in the trade statistics yearbook of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), it can be seen that Shanghai accounts for 70 to 80% of the total import of these non-urgent, unnecessary, and even luxury goods nationwide. If you want to list them one by one, the length of this article does not allow it. Let’s take a look at those whose annual import volume in Shanghai is more than 1 million customs gold units. The import value in the 28th year of the Republic (1939) is compared with the national import value at the same time as shown in the following table:

Comparison of Prohibited Import Goods with Annual Import Value of More Than 1 Million Customs Gold Units in Shanghai with the Whole Country

(Note) Unit: Thousand Gold Units

The above only refers to those whose import value in Shanghai is more than one million gold units. These imports are all luxury goods and unreasonable consumables. However, if mineral oil and kerosene are used as lamp oil, they can be replaced by domestic vegetable oil. Therefore, they are also on the list of prohibited imports. However, those in cans are not prohibited, because those in cans are for small consumers, in other words, for household use, so household kerosene should not rise in price.

If we consider those whose annual import value in Shanghai is more than 100,000 gold units, there are even more types. Let’s list them.

Prohibited Import Goods with Annual Import Value of More Than 100,000 Customs Gold Units in Shanghai and their Tariff Numbers

Tariff Number (Name of Prohibited Import Goods, their Use, and Whether There are Substitutes)

120 Pure wool or mixed wool clippings and returns (Luxury, with substitutes)

615 Glassware (With substitutes)

641 Gramophones and their parts (Luxury)

655 Perfume and cosmetics (Luxury)

667 Cosmetic appliances (Luxury)

668 Toys and games (Luxury, with substitutes)

Looking at the above goods, they are nothing more than silk and wool products, seafood, candies, table sugar, Western wines, tobacco, high-quality paper, high-quality wood, medicines, cosmetics, toys, etc., either absolutely luxurious, or although some are necessary, there are domestic products that can be substituted. However, about 100 million yuan is spent on these every year. The saving of this 100 million yuan can at least increase Shanghai's necessary import volume by half to one times its current volume. At the same time, it can also enable domestic substitute producers to increase their turnover by several tens of percent to one times or even several times. Not only can Shanghai's necessary goods market be stabilized, but it can also enable domestic producers to obtain an opportunity to develop their business. However, because these goods cannot be imported, it is not unexpected that the speculation and manipulation of their inventory market will follow, and even attempts to buy black exchange and engage in smuggling.

Commercial News

### Overseas Cotton Market Firm and High

The New York cotton market is firm and stable. The weather report is good, but the New Orleans cotton market rose, and news of revised cotton prices from Washington came. As a result, both futures and spot prices rose by 13 to 20 points, more or less.

Washington Electric: The US Department of Commerce Statistics Bureau issued the second US cotton ginning report. The original telegram is recorded on the left (unit: one bale, each bale 500 pounds)

Bombay Cotton Market initially fell due to sales by European exporters, and then rose slightly due to short covering and purchases by speculators, and finally rose again due to early signs of weather in the cotton area. As a result, the prices of various brands fell by one rupee and 25 to one rupee and 75 more or less than the previous day.

It is also predicted that today's opening price of Indian cotton will be high by two and a half rupees.

### Cigarettes Rise Sharply and Fall Rapidly; Daily Necessities Also Fall

The cigarette market rose and fell sharply. It is heard that the factories are distributing goods, and there will be a distribution soon. As a result, people are becoming more and more tired. Stockpilers inside and outside the industry are seeking to get out. There are few buyers, and transactions are mainly for door-to-door sales, so the price has fallen sharply. The price of Great Britain brand has fallen to 2,190 yuan per box, Old Knife brand to 1,910 yuan, Five China brand to 1,220 yuan, Small Fairy brand to 1,460 yuan, and Pinhai brand to 1,550 yuan. The buying price has generally fallen by several hundred yuan compared to before.

The market conditions for daily necessities have also declined amidst the trend of falling prices. It is said that a certain atmosphere is quite strong in the market, which has caused people from all sides to become soft and tired, and most of them are stopping advances and retreating. Therefore, the buying price has generally fallen slightly. Gu Ben soap is 62 yuan per box, Bai Xiangmao soap is 52 yuan, and Huang Xiangmao soap is 47 yuan, which is one or two yuan less than the previous day. Beautiful brand matches are 980 yuan per box, and Phoenix brand is 940 yuan, which is a sharp drop of more than 100 yuan compared to the highest price. Sailboat brand candles are 36 yuan and 5 jiao per box, which is also slightly 2 yuan less. Sellers have difficulty selling, because buyers are temporarily watching. The market will inevitably fall again.

### Sugar Cane and Cane Sugar (Part of China) (6)

(Continued from August 11th) Gao Jiannong

They were also indirectly stimulated and influenced by them. Please see the method for making "white sugar" in *Tiangong Kaiwu*, written by the late Ming Dynasty Ningbo native Song Yingxing in the tenth year of Chongzhen (1637): "...After winter, old sugar cane,... squeeze the juice into a vat,... it condenses into black sand,... then wash it down with yellow mud water: The black dregs enter the vat, and inside it, white frost forms. The top layer, about five inches thick, is exceptionally pure white, called "foreign sugar"; the lower layers are slightly yellowish-brown." He specifically annotates below the words "foreign sugar," saying, "Western sugar is exceptionally beautiful, hence the name." Isn't this clear evidence of influence from foreigners? He then immediately describes the method for making "rock sugar": "To make rock sugar, melt foreign sugar with egg white, remove the floating impurities, and observe the color of the fire. Break fresh green bamboo into thin strips, chop them into inch-long pieces and scatter them into the mixture. After a night, it naturally forms ice blocks... Our country's refining technology for cane sugar can be considered powerfully proven at this time!"

The conclusion is: In ancient China, only emperors or high-ranking officials had the privilege of occasionally enjoying cane sugar. Even in the early Qing Dynasty, famous and prominent officials like Lian Xixian—known as Lian Mencius—were unable to easily find granulated sugar for medicinal purposes. The powerful traitor Ahe offered him three catties, but he refused, saying, "He would not seek survival through what was given by a treacherous person." Only the emperor could "hear of it and bestow it as a gift." This shows that cane sugar was not something ordinary people dared to desire. But now? Cane sugar is so plentiful and so cheap that everyone can touch it and enjoy it.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### An Experiment with Clothing

— Ge Liang

I heard that wearing a Western suit is like carrying a [preferential ticket], while wearing a traditional long gown is like carrying a special permit].

Indeed, actions speak louder than words. If you are neatly dressed in a Western suit, acquaintances will smile and nod to you, and even strangers will cast admiring glances at you. Of course, those who wear blue cloth long gowns do not have the opportunity to enjoy such blessings.

Furthermore, wearing a Western suit allows you to barge into those tall buildings without anyone daring to stop you. If you enter a five- or six-story apartment building, office building, or hotel, you can take the elevator if you don't feel like walking, and you will also receive many conveniences when making inquiries. Otherwise, they will first size you up from head to toe because of your blue cloth long gown.

The elevator operator says: [Hey! Are your legs broken? Walk up, why take the tofu frame!]

The person answering your questions will say in a strange tone, slowly and deliberately: [Open your own eyes and look for it, I'm not hired by you.]

Hmph! What else is there to say about the preferential treatment of a Western suit.

If you occasionally carry a small grocery basket or an oil bottle on the street for your mother or wife, you will receive many criticisms if you are wearing a Western suit.

Heh, this person is really funny, wearing a Western suit but carrying a basket in his hand.]

Actually, what does it matter? But people will treat you like you're putting on a show, or even...

[A wrongful death!]

Furthermore, if you have an itchy throat or are hungry and eat cold noodles at a street stall, you will receive similar criticisms and get no help.

If you wear a long gown, that's considered normal, and no one will say anything to you. Why? Because it's a [special permit].

Therefore, wearing a Western suit is like carrying a [preferential ticket], while wearing a long gown is like carrying a [special permit].

However, wearing a Western suit also has a [special permit] effect in one area. This unique [special permit] (which is certainly not allowed for those in the long gown class) is that you can walk a dog. Therefore, all you gentlemen who wear long gowns, if you plan to take an animal for a walk (if you don't want to at all, that's of course best), then you should drag along a [cat]!

Alas, people's words are frightening!

### Strange Food Records

— Jingzheng

Different places have vastly different customs. Naturally, food is no exception. I happened to see a record about strange foods in the world. It was truly unheard of and unseen.

In Tokyo, Japan, some people use sugar juice and wild honey to soak and cook oranges, creating a very special kind of orange candy.

Volcanic mud, according to experts, can be used as food. This food was found at the foot of a volcano in Japan. This soil is found five to one inch below the surface, tastes like potatoes, and contains a large amount of nutrients that can sustain our lives for a long time!

The Javanese take the soil under the bark of trees, boil it, and use it as food. Africans eat termites containing liquid raw, or sometimes fry or roast them with oil. People in [blank space] place make a paste out of ant eggs, then mix it with sweet almonds to create a fragrant delicacy.

In Guangdong, southwestern America, South America, Australia, and other places in our country, many people eat snakes, and it is said that they taste very good; perhaps everyone knows this. However, there is also a kind of smelly rat whose meat can also be eaten. [The natives of Argentina consider smelly rats as delicacies, just as we view ham and chicken]. A Kansas University professor once said this!

Professor A.M. Reese used gophers and muskrats to make various meats; the eaters could not tell the difference. He also tried making things like dragons and fire snakes. (Fire snakes have become common commodities in the Mexico City market.) He also cut up crocodiles into slices, which he said tasted as delicious as beef.

These scattered records show that in the future world, humans may not need to worry about the lack of food resources because they are inexhaustible and unlimited!

### The Procession of the Wedding

— Zheng Yimei

When love matures, it must go through the stage of marriage. The character for marriage in history is written as "昏" [hūn, meaning dusk]. The *Bai Hu Tong* says: "Marriage is completed at dusk, hence the name '昏'." This custom seems to be the same in both the East and the West, because weddings are always held in the late afternoon near dusk. There has never been a wedding where the piano is played and songs are sung in a grand hall early in the morning, with the couple happily united. There is another point on which East and West are in agreement: according to our country's old custom, when a woman is about to be married off, just before she enters the bridal sedan chair, her father must hold his daughter in his arms and whisper a few words of earnest advice. In Western customs, during the wedding procession, the bride must also be supported by her father, slowly and reluctantly bringing his daughter to the chapel. The intention is nothing more than that the father has spent more than ten or twenty years of his efforts, raising and educating her, and now it has come to an end. The wedding march, in the wedding's first movement, is written by Mendelssohn, the melody is solemn, clear, and measured, like lifting up and dropping down, listening to it makes one feel transported. The second movement, after the wedding, is written by Wagner, it is also undulating, subtle, and slowly exudes purity. But at that time, the guests, one after another, threw confetti and flowers at the faces of the newlyweds, in a burst of chaos, and no longer paid attention to how the melody was. Our country's young people are enamored with Westernization, and Western wedding marches are also used in their wedding ceremonies.

But most orchestras deal with it casually, and the result is neither fish nor fowl. My old friend Zhao Junzhiyan, who was the director of the orchestra at Jiaotong University, has the intelligence of a teacher, the beauty of Wu Shao's music, and has specially organized the Haiguang Wind Orchestra with several comrades to serve as the noblest professional music, which is very different from ordinary orchestras. (All contact is handled by Yongxing Music Store at No. 403 Jing'an Temple Road.) The ancients said well: [When the angle is moved, the valley flowers will brighten, when Shang is struck, the spring forest will shatter]. The Haiguang Orchestra's artistic excellence is good enough to move these two sentences to them.

### How to Use a Thermos

— Lu Juchuan

After reading Mr. Changcheng Gan's article "How to Use a Thermos" in the previous issue of this journal, I feel that there is still something more to be said about how to extend its life and maintain its effectiveness. I am adding two more points below.

If the cork is new, you may want to use a silver needle to pierce a small hole in the center of the cork to avoid the glass liner breaking halfway. This is because when the bottle is filled with boiling water, it gradually cools over time. When it cools, the water contracts. At this time, if the cork is plugged so tightly that water cannot leak out, it will shrink and break the glass liner.

When you buy a new thermos, unscrew it before using it and remove any cardboard inside to prevent water from seeping in and rotting the inside of the bottle shell. If the inside is unglazed, you can spread petroleum jelly (used for machinery) all over the inside or paint it. Use a nail to poke a few holes in the bottom so that if water seeps in, it will not easily rust and rot, and it can flow out through the holes. Also, apply anti-rust oil to the threads so that it will be easier to unscrew and inspect in the future. (With thanks)

### Things to Know When Driving a Car

— Revised and Supplemented

Most car drivers think that when a tire blows, the safest way is to brake immediately, the faster the better. Some drivers also believe that this method can protect the hard rubber tire.

In fact, such an emergency method may protect the rubber tire, but it may also harm the driver's life. Because if the driver brakes immediately at that time, it will help the car body to overturn due to the action of centrifugal force. Wouldn't that be a case of being penny-wise and pound-foolish? Drivers should remember never to panic and rashly apply the brakes when a tire blows. The correct method is to increase the vehicle speed to about five miles per hour. At that time, the car needs a contracting force the most. If the driver can remember this method, they can always get the necessary contracting force. The second step is to gradually brake, so that the car body is stable and can be stopped under control without suddenly overturning.

### The Problem of Transportation

— Tu Shouzhuo

In order to maintain the generous profits of investors, public transportation such as buses and trams has already been raised in price again. The increase is more than 50%, which is an unprecedented precedent and can be described as shocking. Colleagues A, B, and C have each determined a method to deal with this problem, and they are specially recorded as follows, for the benefit of those who wish to save on consumption.

A's method is to [reduce the number of trips]. He originally took the bus for his daily commute, but now he has decided to take the bus as usual in the morning to avoid the fatigue of walking, which would affect his work spirit. In the afternoon, he will switch to walking. At that time, the official business is over, and it is no problem to go home a little later. Even if he feels tired, he can recover during his night's rest. As a result, he can save 25% of the fare. (Assuming a 50% increase)

B's method is to [shorten the route]. He lives on Jing'an Temple Road, which is on Tongli Road. He originally commuted daily from Xiejiao Station to Henan Road Station, with a fare of one dime each time for third class. Now, he walks to Mahe Road Station in the morning, and takes the bus to Mahe Road Station in the afternoon, getting on and off there. The fare is still one dime each time, absolutely no more than a penny.

C's method is to [reset the standard]. He will switch to walking on sunny days and still take the bus on rainy days. In the past, his bus fare was about ten yuan per month. Now, counting a quarter of rainy days, plus the price increase (also assuming a 50% increase), he can save more than six yuan.

[When three people walk together, there must be one who can be my teacher]. Now we can use this to metaphorize that A, B, and C [choose the good and follow it]. I wish to learn from B, or even walk regardless of wind or rain.

### One Week's Home-Style Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Alfalfa, commonly known as "goutou" or "jinyang," is a beautiful thing. When the new product is on the market, it is in the limelight, occupying a special place on the banquet with new bean sprouts. These days, new goutou is active again, at ten cents per ounce. In this era of generally high prices, it doesn't feel too expensive, so my family has eaten it twice. One time it was braised goutou with meat (this character is made up by the author; pronounced "bian," the same as "bian" meaning acupuncture). The goutou was moistened with meat oil and was very fragrant and delicious. The fresh green color was also very pleasing to the eye. One time it was made vegetarian, with added dried tofu strips and braised together. The oil had to be used heavily, and a little white wine had to be added. Although it was vegetarian, it was still fresh and delicious.

Monday: Meatballs, goutou, sweet and sour ribbonfish, stir-fried glass noodles with vegetables, braised edamame in sauce

Tuesday: Leek sprouts with shredded beef, braised tofu skin with white shrimp, braised cabbage, salted vegetable and broad bean soup

Wednesday: Dried meat, grape soup, scallion-baked small crucian carp, stir-fried gluten with shrimp roe, deep-fried dough sticks with bok choy

Thursday: Tomato beef slices, mixed tofu, shredded tofu skin and water chestnut, salted vegetable and soybean sprouts

Friday: Broad beans stir-fried with shredded pork, steamed eggs with dried shrimp, braised vegetarian winter melon, stir-fried flat beans in sweet sauce

Saturday: Stir-fried silver sprouts with shredded chicken, braised flower carp with glass noodles, braised vegetarian ten-scene dish, scallion oil noodles

Sunday: Duck and chicken soup, stir-fried eel back, goutou, mixed jellyfish

Meat prices are soaring, so we can eat tofu; if tofu prices soar, what can we do! (Written by Fanxing)

Spring and Autumn

### Journalist's Day

— Weisan

Today is Journalist's Day, just like Children's Day and Teacher's Day, we also have such a festive day. How should we commemorate it? I think we don't need to fantasize about the future, but should review the past, and more importantly, strive to uphold our current positions. Let everyone be silent for a moment and make a self-accounting—this "we" refers to all journalists. It is necessary today, not meaningless.

Reviewing the past does not require tracing back too far. Taking the most recent four years or so, the entire nation has gone through such a major ordeal. Many journalists have fulfilled their due responsibilities. This is something to be proud of. If writing the history of this era, the struggle of journalists cannot be erased. We don't need to doubt the old saying "Power cannot corrupt, wealth cannot seduce." There are plenty of facts to answer, and we can cite a certain person or a certain event to explain the essence of it. It is autumn now. If you go to the park, you can see pine and cypress trees standing tall one by one. Under the trees are many fallen leaves. "When the autumn wind rises, the yellow leaves fly." The autumn wind is sweeping away the fallen leaves. We don't want to be fallen leaves, and we hope that everyone is a strong and proud pine and cypress tree, standing out from the crowd.

The times give us the opportunity to be tempered. We should seize the times. If we say that we have suffered, everyone has a share, not just journalists. However, we stand at the forefront of society, so we must fulfill the responsibility of "standing at the forefront." Everyone should embrace the view that "there is no high position that is not built on a low foundation," and do a little bit to accumulate a little bit, like ants carrying a grain of rice and horses bearing a thousand pounds. We only seek our own peace, only do our own best, and everyone should work hard in their respective positions.

### Wang Yunwu's Account of Lufei Bohong's Success Story

— Ming

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The memorial service for Mr. Lufei Bohong was held at 3:00 p.m. on August 10th at the Confucius Hall here. All colleagues of the Zhonghua Book Company, members of parliament staying in Hong Kong, and friends and relatives of Mr. Lufei Bohong attended in person. Representatives from various cultural groups numbered in the thousands. The memorial service was conducted as scheduled, and the meeting adjourned in a mournful and solemn atmosphere at 4:15 p.m.

Mr. Ma Chaojun delivered the opening remarks. After the oblation, Mr. Wang Yunwu reported on Mr. Bohong's life, saying:

"Mr. Bohong only received five years of education from his mother, one year from his father, and one year from a teacher. At the age of seventeen, he independently studied. At the age of seventeen, he founded a family school in Nanchang. At the age of nineteen, he founded the New Academic World Bookstore in Wuchang. At the age of twenty, he served as the chief writer for the Hankou Chu Bao. Because his remarks offended the authorities, the newspaper was forced to cease publication. He transferred to Shanghai to manage the Qianchangming Bookstore. At the age of twenty-one, he joined the Civilization Book Company as an editor. Two years later, he became the publishing director of the Commercial Press and the editor of the Education Magazine..."

"In addition to the struggle of his youth, Mr. Bohong's success was also due to his profound vision. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, he predicted that the Qing Dynasty would be overthrown and the Republic of China would be established. He gathered comrades to prepare new textbooks to meet the new needs. On New Year's Day of the first year of the Republic of China, he founded the Zhonghua Book Company and published the Zhonghua textbooks, which were popular for a time... In the past five or six years, he predicted that our country's legal tender policy would inevitably be implemented, so he focused on the printing of banknotes, and the book company's business became even more prosperous. Mr. Bohong also wrote an article on war preparedness in the inaugural issue of the "New China," believing that if China were to engage in external wars, it would have to fight a long-term war. Therefore, he advocated active preparation in the three areas of military affairs, people's food, and transportation. His opinions are quite in line with the government's current facilities."

"Mr. Bohong's excellent character must also be mentioned here: (1) Strong will—he encountered many difficulties in the early stages of the Zhonghua Book Company, but he was able to persevere. (2) Progressiveness—he was unwilling to be behind others in everything he did. After he established his own brand, he competed fiercely with the Commercial Press in business. The Commercial Press originally started with textbooks, and later expanded its scope of publication. Mr. Bohong was unwilling to let anything go: The Commercial Press published the Sibu Congkan, and Zhonghua immediately edited and printed the Sibu Beiyao; the Commercial Press compiled and printed the Ciyuan, and Zhonghua published Ci... (3) Focus—Mr. Bohong has been in charge of the Zhonghua Book Company for thirty years, with one heart and one mind, and no other pursuits. He rarely engaged in outside socializing. He even politely declined when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited him to become an official. The business world in our country often says: "People in the same trade are like enemies." The Commercial Press and Zhonghua inevitably experienced this phenomenon at a certain period. However, after intense and fair competition, they gradually gained a deeper understanding of each other and gradually turned into sincere cooperation. In the past few years, my understanding of Mr. Bohong's sincere attitude is exactly the same as the degree of suspicion I had of him before."

### I Am an Apprentice, I Want to Take Supplementary Lessons

— Yu Ren

I was quite moved after reading the article "How Shop Assistants and Apprentices Can Study" in the Spring and Autumn column. I am also an apprentice in a cloth shop, and how eager I am for further education!

Two years ago, I was still living a school life, but now I live an apprentice life and serve in society. I feel that my knowledge is shallow and insufficient, which makes me feel extremely painful. Finally, I found a way out in the pain and entered a supplementary school. However, the expenses must be borne by my family. But the home of an apprentice can probably be imagined.

Since entering the supplementary school, I have gained a lot of knowledge that is helpful for my job, and I can also get to know many unfamiliar classmates. However, I also feel a shortcoming. The biggest problem in the supplementary school is that it starts well but ends poorly. In the first month of school, the classroom is packed and there is not a single empty seat. Some seats even need to be added. This phenomenon shows that there is no shortage of ambitious young people. However, when the semester ends, anyone who has been attending the supplementary school can probably see that the number of students has dwindled to just a few. Although there are vocational workers who have various reasons for it in their jobs, it should not be so desolate. After my various investigations, I got the following two answers:

First, when entering a supplementary school, there is no need for a level placement exam, and students can insert themselves at will. Therefore, general young people with high ambitions insert themselves into a level that is higher than their own without knowing their own abilities. Just imagine how they can keep up later, so they lose interest and drop out halfway.

Second, they don't have the determination to go to school and are absent from class at will. They even borrow the name of supplementary lessons to go to other improper places without being bound by them.

Of course, this is not a generalization. Perhaps some people drop out halfway due to the influence of their jobs, and we sympathize and forgive them. But it is a great pity that people generally drop out and are absent at will. We are fortunate to have the opportunity to enter a supplementary school to study. In this society, there are still thousands and thousands of young apprentices and shop assistants who do not have time to study but want to pursue advanced studies. Now that the Shenbao is promoting the reading movement for shop assistants and apprentices, since we have the opportunity to read, we should work harder for ourselves, and then push ourselves to serve the society and the country. (With thanks)

Twelve Unexpected Storms

"Don't be so suspicious!... Go back quickly, come out quickly!... "It wasn't until Mei Bao repeatedly urged her that she squinted her old eyes and said vaguely.

Although Mei Bao knew that she was drunk, this fifty-year-old Wang, the warden of the dormitory, was indeed too capable and too shrewd, so Mei Bao couldn't help but reluctantly put down the doubts in her heart.

"Who doesn't like gambling! He usually doesn't gamble. But when someone pulls him to go, he can't control himself... "Mei Bao had already stepped out of the warden's office, and Warden Zhang was still talking to herself inside. This made Mei Bao feel much more at ease. And what the person who came said was also very reasonable.

"Originally, they wanted to send Sixth Elder to come, but unfortunately he is getting engaged these days, and he really can't spare the time, so they asked me, the old man, to run here for you."

When he said this, Mei Bao's suspicion caused by the fact that Little Dog's brother didn't come was mostly dispelled.

In the blink of an eye, another half month slipped by unnoticed. One afternoon, Warden Wang, as usual, gathered a large bundle of mail that had just been sent in through the gatehouse and scrutinized it one by one in the sunlight, showing an attitude as solemn as checking military intelligence.

Anecdotes

### Random Notes from Xinan Thatched Cottage

— Liutang

The Ullambana Festival (1)

As the early autumn arrives, in every neighborhood, one often sees paper clothes fluttering, strings of ghost money, and at night, the noisy sounds of drums and cymbals, and the mournful sounds of conch shells. Monks chant scriptures, which lasts for hours, and it is called the Ullambana Festival. According to research, Ullambana is an abbreviation of the Sanskrit word "Ullambana," also written as "Ullambaka," not that the meanings are different, but the transliterations are slightly different. "Ullamba" or "Ulamba" means "upside down." "Pana" refers to utensils, translated into Chinese as "pen" (basin), and the sounds of "pen" and "pana" can be combined to form the same word, so "pen" can be said to be both a phonetic and semantic translation.

The origin of the Ullambana Festival is the folk tale of Maudgalyayana saving his mother. The Venerable Maudgalyayana was a disciple of the Buddha. He saw his mother fall into the realm of hungry ghosts. Maudgalyayana wanted to feed her, but his mother was consumed by flames of hunger, fire coming out of her mouth and turning everything into charcoal. Maudgalyayana was overcome with grief and sought guidance from the Buddha. The Buddha spoke to him about the Ullambana Sutra. "Ullambana" means a vessel for rescuing those hung upside down. Therefore, he was instructed to prepare abundant offerings on the fifteenth day of the seventh month every year, offering hundreds of items to the Three Jewels and offering them to the passing Buddhas, thus saving seven generations of ancestors. Therefore, in Buddhism, there is the Ullambana Dharma Assembly to save the ancestors from the suffering of being hung upside down. I once saw Li Yunfu perform "Maudgalyayana Saving His Mother," holding a bamboo stick in his mouth with two lit candles on it, symbolizing fire spitting from the mouth. Maudgalyayana's mother eventually relied on the power of the Ullambana Festival to be liberated from the realm of hungry ghosts.

The Ullambana Sutra was introduced to China and translated by Zhu Fahu during the Western Jin Dynasty, and the Ullambana Festival appeared in China during the Datong era of Emperor Wu of Liang. Buddhism flourished in China during the Six Dynasties, and the teachers and translators who came to preach were all Western monks, called "Dao Ren" (Taoists), just as Guanshiyin Bodhisattva was called Cihang Dao Ren, which is the same idea. Only after Fu Qin did Chinese people begin to be tonsured as monks. "Seng" (monk) is a transliteration of "Sangha." However, the rituals performed in today's Ullambana Festival are actually Yoga Flaming Mouth rituals. "Yoga" is the general name for Esoteric Buddhism. Within Buddhism, there is a distinction between Exoteric and Esoteric. The Exoteric can be found in scriptures and texts, which is the Buddhism popular in China. The Esoteric relies on the transmission from a master, reciting mantras and practicing dharma, which is the Yellow Sect and Red Sect revered in Sichuan and Tibet.
