### President Roosevelt Firmly Declares: The United States Will Support China; New Plans to Aid [Allied] Nations Will Be Announced Upon Return from Trip; Corley Suggests Assisting China with Flying Fortresses

Washington – After returning to the United States from his tour of China's Free Areas, Corley submitted a report to President Roosevelt. Although its release was delayed, newspapers have now decided to disclose some of its contents. Corley is known to be one of President Roosevelt’s aides, a man of few words, and not considered a military expert, but rather a reliable reporter. According to reports, Corley brought back a list detailing China's various needs for counterattacking Japan. In terms of modern warfare, this list can be considered extremely simple. According to Corley, China needs fewer than twenty Flying Fortresses, two hundred new-style fighter planes, some aviation gasoline and steel weaponry, and some artillery and ammunition. With these, China would be sufficient to drive back Japan. It is said that Corley advocates that the United States adopt a bold diplomatic approach. Rumor has it that Corley believes the friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has been resolved, and that China has confidence in ultimate victory. Corley himself also believes that the Japanese cannot blockade the Burma Road. It is said that Corley pointed out the following two points to demonstrate the effectiveness of China's future counteroffensive: (1) The Japanese military strength in China is exhausted, and its morale is declining, a situation far worse than Washington knows. (2) Flying Fortresses can drop incendiary bombs on Japan's paper-and-wood industrial concentration areas, delivering a physical blow to Japan's war effort. If the above suggestions are true, it is currently unknown to what extent the authorities will adopt them. However, the President has indeed formally and firmly declared that he will support China. It is a well-known habit that the President returns with plans he has formulated shortly after each trip. Therefore, it would not be surprising if the President returns one day with new plans to aid China and other nations. After all, the Lend-Lease Act was announced after the President returned from a fishing trip. Advocates here for a bolder policy in the Pacific are gaining ground due to the US fleet's visits to New Zealand and Australia. Conservative elements in the naval community had previously predicted that US warships venturing west of the 180th meridian would be attacked or driven back by the Japanese. Now, many here believe that if the US fleet were to visit Singapore this time, it would be enough to deter Japan from coveting Malaya. (Reuters, 26th)

### War Spreads Across Europe and Africa Due to Delayed Aid to China; Lord Lytton Issues Justifiable Argument

London – Lord Lytton, writing in the Manchester Guardian, stated: "We are pleased to hear President Roosevelt's remarks that China will receive various forms of American aid in its heroic resistance. If we had given China more aid in 1932, would we have seen Hitlerism rise in Germany, or the war spread to Europe and Africa? All the actions and methods of the two European thugs we are fighting today were first used by the Asian thug, Japan, such as starting wars without declaration, calling wars of aggression wars for peace, feigning friendship to conceal war preparations, inciting disturbances in neighboring countries to justify restoring order and armed intervention, forcibly occupying other countries' territories while claiming to have no territorial ambitions, and establishing puppet governments in false alliances. All of these were invented by Japan. However, from 1931 to 1933, few people understood the disastrous consequences that the world's passive acquiescence to this new form of aggression would bring. Now, after more than a decade of continuous warfare, the spirit of the Chinese people has not been dissipated. The sacrifices made by China have stimulated the Chinese people to develop an unprecedented national unity in their history. European nationalism was promoted by Napoleon, while Chinese nationalism was promoted by Japan. Japan will be destroyed by what it has promoted, just like Napoleon." (Reuters, 26th)

### US and Netherlands Discuss Supply Issues; Dutch Representative to Visit Australia

Washington – Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens and Colonial Minister Welter, who arrived here from England last week, have been in contact with US government officials for a long time regarding the issue of the US supplying defense equipment. Both plan to visit Batavia and Australia before returning to England. The outcome of their trip will certainly further adjust the prospects for joint defense by Australia and the Netherlands in the Pacific. Both are scheduled to take a clipper from San Francisco to Manila within this week, and then transfer to Batavia. According to Welter, the Dutch East Indies plans to ship large quantities of tin and rubber to the United States. (Special dispatch, 25th)

Dutch Foreign Minister's Broadcast Speech

New York – Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens broadcast here today, saying that since January of this year, the production of US military aircraft has increased ninefold, and by June this production will increase fifteenfold compared to January. President Roosevelt assured him that he is determined to see the Netherlands restored as an independent nation. The only thing that cannot be determined at present is when victory can be achieved. However, he firmly believes that the Dutch, like the British, will have the strength to persevere to the end, and are constantly working hard to prepare for the future of rebuilding on the ruins created by Germany, so as to immediately supply the Netherlands with relief goods after the war.

### Japan Imports Gasoline from the United States; Seven Times More Than Last Year

London – War Minister of the British Government, Lord Dorington, declared in the House of Commons yesterday that the British and American governments were engaged in discussions regarding Japan's increasing import of gasoline from the United States. He stated that this gasoline, when mixed with tetraethyl lead, could be transformed into gasoline suitable for aviation use. This situation could naturally undermine the United States' ban on the export of aviation gasoline to Japan. According to experts, Japan's gasoline imports from the United States in August 1940 were seven times greater than in the same period in 1939. (United Press, 26th)

Matsuoka Arrives in Berlin Last Night; German-Japanese Conference to Begin Immediately; US-Japan Confrontation and Military Issues Will Occupy Important Place in Discussions

Berlin – German Radio reported that Matsuoka will arrive in Berlin at 6:00 PM today. (Reuters, 26th)

Berlin – Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka arrived at Makinija, Germany, last night with his entourage. The German government dispatched Ambassador Stahmer, Stormtroop Leader Teng Jia, and Colonel Marski to welcome him. Matsuoka is expected to arrive in Berlin today. Streets here are decorated with flags to welcome him. The Japanese Foreign Minister will stay here for five days, holding consultations with government officials. He will be received by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop tomorrow, followed by an exchange of views between Hitler and Matsuoka. The Japanese Foreign Minister is also scheduled to meet with Economic Minister Dr. Funk and Air Force Minister Marshal Goering. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)

Berlin – News emerged here yesterday that after Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka arrives in Berlin, he will immediately hold a meeting with German leaders. The content will include Japan's confrontation with the United States in the Far East, or even the establishment of a new agreement with Berlin. Matsuoka arrived in Berlin by train this morning. This is the initial decision for the Japanese Foreign Minister to visit Berlin. According to reliable German spokespersons, the Japanese Foreign Minister's decision to visit is actually based on the belief that the Axis powers will win against the United States passing the Lend-Lease Act. Matsuoka's trip before Yugoslavia joined the Axis represents the climax of the Axis's spring diplomatic offensive. When the Japanese side announced the visit to Berlin, authoritative circles made two important statements: (1) Military issues will occupy an important place in the discussion. (2) Germany and Japan may use this opportunity to sign some new agreements. Japanese sources here believe that Matsuoka is eager to know what kind of military and other assistance Japan will receive from the Axis powers if it comes into conflict with the United States by adopting a "hard-line policy in the Far East." In short, all German comments believe that military and diplomatic applications will occupy an important place in future talks. There is also much speculation here, expressing doubts about what kind of treaty Japan and Germany will sign. As for the German islands that Japan is currently temporarily administering, whether they will be on the agenda is unknown. The German side declined to comment. The German side believes that this visit has a "demonstrative" significance. Some diplomatic circles here also believe this to be true. German newspapers also published Matsuoka's visit with a prominent position, believing that Matsuoka's meeting with German and Italian military and political leaders is of great importance. In any case, the German government is making great efforts to welcome Matsuoka. (United Press, 26th)

Berlin – German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels publicly stated to the Berlin public last night that welcoming Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is a manifestation of German-Japanese friendship. All factories in Berlin will close at 2:00 PM today so that workers can have the opportunity to welcome the Japanese Foreign Minister. German newspapers also stated that Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima issued a statement as Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka was about to arrive in Berlin, elucidating German-Japanese cooperative relations, believing that Germany and Japan not only have no political disputes, but also have a common goal of building a new order in the crumbling old world. The conclusion of the Tripartite Pact has increased the strength of the Axis powers. Countries with the same attitude have joined the Tripartite Pact. The Japanese Foreign Minister's visit to Berlin at a time of international tension is of great significance. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)

Rome – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will arrive in Rome on the 31st of this month. It is said that he will stay for three days and return to Berlin. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)

I believe that no true American wants to see the country politically unified in a way that destroys the two-party government system. But at this time, all citizens, whether Republican, Democrat, or independent, must devote themselves to national defense, ensuring that the country can stand invincible against any attack." (Havas, 26th)

Washington – Knudsen, Director of the Manufacturing Bureau of the National Defense Committee, spoke at the Senate, strongly stating that once American industry has completed its preparations, its total production can be doubled.

### The Dynamics of the Balkans

Surprisingly, the European war has not seen major military developments in the Balkans. The Greco-Italian War has so far been only a local war and has not yet merged with the main forces between Britain and Germany. Germany's management of the Balkans, although relying on military force as a threat, has not yet taken any large-scale war actions. At the same time, the advances and retreats, intrigues, and power struggles of both belligerents and third countries in this area are more profound than anywhere else, and the intricate complexity of international diplomatic relations also constitutes a spectacle in this corner. In the most recent two or three days, Yugoslavia's alliance and the reaffirmation of the Soviet-Turkish non-aggression declaration have shown that the diplomatic and political operations of the belligerents and related countries in this area have reached their maximum extent, and will also exert a decisive and epoch-making significance for the body of the European war.

For more than half a year, Germany has adopted an offensive in the political and economic aspects of its management of Southeastern Europe, while maintaining a defensive arrangement in military terms. From the Danube basin to the Balkan Peninsula is Germany's rear force, and also an important warehouse for it to obtain fuel, food, and various materials. On the other hand, because Britain, Greece and Turkey stand on the tip of the Balkans, and are separated by sea from Britain's Near East military base, and are the most convenient route for the British army to attack Germany. Therefore, after the Western European war gradually stalled last autumn, Germany turned to the east to develop, forcibly placing those helpless small and medium-sized countries under its iron fist. This was no accident, as Hitler had his own important basic reasons: first, to avoid the war affecting the Danube basin and the Balkans; second, to avoid sharply stimulating the Soviet Union. The former focuses on economic requirements, and the latter on political factors; but in the final analysis, they are both to avoid the danger of fighting on two fronts, so as to focus on dealing with Britain on the Western Front. On this point, Hitler's achievements have had a considerable effect, but in the course of factual development, those two beliefs cannot be achieved at the same time. Italy's invasion of Greece was already the prelude to a major war in the Balkans; although Hitler tried his best to calm down and restrain himself, and only used his military coercion under the standard of peace to make countries such as Bulgaria and Yugoslavia submit, he could not absolutely guarantee that the fire of war would not cross the Balkan Mountains and spread northward. The rumored attack on Greece has not been realized for a long time, and the reason for it may lie in this. If Hitler were as reckless and hasty as Mussolini, the Romanian oil fields and the Bulgarian food warehouse would inevitably become sacrifices under the British air force. As for the Soviet Union and Germany, Nazi operations have always regarded maintaining good neighborly relations of non-aggression with the Soviet Union as a supreme and important condition. The Soviet Union's past military advances into Poland, operations against Finland, the merger of the three Baltic states, and the retrieval of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, were all ignored by Germany, as it gradually restored its tsarist-era hegemony in the Baltic Sea and territory in Eastern Europe. But on the other hand, Germany's entry and exit into Southeastern Europe finally aroused the Soviet Union's increasing vigilance; and the closer German forces approached the Bosporus Strait and the Aegean Sea, the gates of the Black Sea, the more the Soviet Union could not suppress its aversion. Bulgaria's joining the Axis, the Soviet authorities had already begun to announce their disagreement with German military actions; to Yugoslavia joining the Axis, it even changed its consistent attitude of preventing Turkey from assuming obligations to Britain, and encouraged the Turkish authorities to resist aggression with goodwill and neutrality. This is a warning to Germany, a demonstration against Yugoslavia's accession; to Britain, its objective significance is actually no different from the unprecedented expression of friendship in the past two years. If the German army continues to advance south, even if only targeting Thrace or Salonica, those who are familiar with Turkey's intentions will hardly sit idly by and not resist, let alone the German side further peep at the straits.

Hitler's management of Southeastern Europe has been fully successful to this point, with the exception of Greece. However, as a result, on the one hand, the Danube River basin and the entire Balkans are on the brink of war, and on the other hand, the rift between the Soviet Union and Germany has become superficialized. If he takes another step forward, he will inevitably encounter greater aversion and resistance. Comparing the two, which gains and losses are greater, we do not want to draw conclusions rashly, and even Hitler cannot but give this more serious consideration. Invading Asia Minor from the Balkans to peep at Britain's oil fields and the Suez Canal, although strategically significant, must take advantage of the opportunity of discord between the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Britain to be able to succeed. Now that Britain and Turkey have an alliance, and the Soviet Union and Turkey have just demonstrated their common stance with a declaration, then even if the Nazis originally had such an attempt, they must now stop due to the existence of this new international factor. As for surrounding Greece and coercing negotiations, although it may also be one of Hitler's goals in the east, it cannot represent the entire significance of his management of the Balkans, because to deal with a small peninsula country, Hitler would never regard it as necessary to spend so much effort, not to mention that his management of Southeastern Europe was far earlier than Italy's invasion of Greece; Mussolini's reckless advance into Greece, regardless of Germany's intentions, actually had the meaning of competing with Germany. If the British army landing in Greece at this moment is not prepared to launch a major war in the Balkans, then Germany's management to consolidate the rear and obtain resources, which began last autumn, will come to an end with Yugoslavia's final accession and the Soviet Union's statement of its attitude. Even if it is possible to continue to plot something against Greece, its nature and quantity are only the aftermath of taking advantage of the opportunity, and cannot be regarded as the original final goal of the German side. The future movements of the German side will likely shift to the United States and the Atlantic, as predicted by yesterday's international news.

### Bloody Battle in Northern Jiangxi for Five Days; Japanese Troops Attacking Shanggao Repelled; Most of Japanese Troops Surrounded in Guanqiao and Sixi; Few Break Out and Retreat Eastward; Chinese Troops Pursue in Rain

Chongqing – After fierce fighting throughout the 24th in northern Jiangxi, the Japanese troops east of Shanggao retreated in three routes that night. This was reported by a high-ranking military officer, who also explained that the victory in this battle was the most important victory this year. Since withdrawing from Wuning, the Japanese troops were deeply afraid of the Chinese troops attacking Nanchang, so they made a preemptive plan to attack west from Fengxin, attempting to eliminate the main force of the Chinese troops between Gao'an and Shanggao. After fierce fighting for days, the Chinese troops finally surrounded them in three places at noon on the 24th. In the afternoon, the Japanese side tried to airdrop supplies with more than 30 aircraft, but it was still ineffective. They finally collapsed at 8:00 PM. However, less than one-third of them escaped. In addition to clearing the battlefield, the Chinese troops were pursuing all night in the rain last night. (Havas World Telegraph Agency, 25th)

On the 24th, the Japanese troops again sent reinforcements, making contact in the Guanqiao and Sixi areas east of Shanggao. After nine hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops were cut into three sections and surrounded separately. (Havas World Telegraph Agency, 25th)

Tokyo – According to semi-official sources, when the Japanese troops withdrew from Shanggao yesterday, they adopted the scorched earth policy commonly used by the Chongqing government.

### Berlin Announces Iceland Designated as a War Zone, Warns Neutral Nations of Navigation Dangers, U.S. Remains Silent For Now

Berlin, The official gazette here announced last night that Iceland is now also included in the war zone for German operations against England. This is because British forces have illegally occupied Danish Iceland and are using it as a base. Therefore, Germany has no choice but to take this measure and include it in the war zone.

### Patriotic Military and Civilians in Yugoslavia Indignant, Anti-Axis Demonstrations Erupt, Betraying Allies and Tainting Glorious History, Government Missteps May Trigger Internal Strife

Yugoslav Capital, It was learned here yesterday that a large British force stationed in Greece has arrived at the Yugoslav border west of Salonika. A large part of the Yugoslav army, possessing one million troops, is likely to join the British forces. Widespread dissatisfaction has been expressed since three unknown Serbian representatives were appointed as cabinet members to replace the three who had resigned, so a new cabinet crisis is expected to erupt here. Anti-Axis demonstrations have erupted in Skopje, Kragujevac, and Cetinje. University students in Belgrade sang the national anthem and shouted anti-Axis slogans until their teachers intervened. There are fears that more violent acts may occur in various provinces of Yugoslavia, and some quarters even fear that they may trigger a civil war. Senior government officials said that before Yugoslavia joined the Axis, it had requested a firm guarantee from Britain for a certain number of aircraft and tanks, but the British response was vague and unsatisfactory, so Yugoslavia was forced to join the Axis. (International Dispatch, 26th)

London, A patriotic organization in the Yugoslav capital recently distributed a large number of leaflets, stating, "We have reached the end of our patience. Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact will inevitably lead to the humiliation and death of the country and its people. Those who trifle with the lives of sixteen million people are in fact trifling with their own lives." Yesterday afternoon, all newspapers in the Yugoslav capital issued special editions announcing Yugoslavia's joining of the Tripartite Pact, with large-character headlines and prominently displaying the German and Italian assurances of respecting Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. "Politika" stated that this move provides Yugoslavia with an opportunity to peacefully continue strengthening its policy of loyal cooperation with its neighbors. However, this move is extraordinarily important both domestically and internationally, and unfavorable reactions are expected soon, but the beneficial effects of the pact will satisfy the general public. Last night, the Athens radio station explained the Greek reaction to Yugoslavia's signing of the pact. It was reported that Greek public opinion still cannot believe that Yugoslavia will betray its alliance of many years with Greece and its traditional friendship. Greek public opinion views the future with calmness, confident that the brave Serbian military and civilians will not tarnish their glorious history by harming the people of allied countries. The Turkish radio station broadcast last night that Yugoslav public opinion is quite dismayed, but its nature does not suggest that it will change the situation. The Yugoslav people are not mentally prepared to cope with the situation they now face. Yugoslavia's adherence to the Axis pact is tantamount to acknowledging in advance that Europe and Yugoslavia will be reorganized according to the Axis's wishes in the future. However, from the German point of view, Yugoslavia's signing of the pact should not be regarded as a move to stabilize the situation. The Moscow radio station simply reported Yugoslavia's signing of the pact without comment. (Reuters, 26th)

London, Within hours of Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, the Germans showed their true intentions towards Yugoslavia. Last night's German radio broadcast announced the threat that Germany might enter Yugoslavia to restore order, stating roughly that German troops would not intervene as long as Yugoslavia did not experience unrest, but if there were rebellious actions hindering Germany, then Germany had sufficient troops to deal with them. According to reports received in London, the people of Yugoslavia are very indignant and shocked by the signing of the Tripartite Pact. This emotional surge has actually taken the form of open disturbances. After the announcement of the signing yesterday, the public held meetings and demonstrations. Reports of disturbances in many places across the country have already been received today. According to a Reuters dispatch from the Yugoslav capital, leaflets opposing the act of treason are being secretly distributed. The text in the leaflets reads, "We will not lay down our arms. We wish to maintain glory and freedom at any price." The Yugoslav prime minister and foreign minister returned from Vienna this morning. Their return to the capital was more miserable than their departure for Vienna thirty-six hours earlier. There were no cheers, and no one waved the national flag to them. According to people here, the only Balkan countries not yet enveloped by the Axis sphere of influence are Greece and Turkey. (Reuters, 26th)

### Romania's Example Serves as a Warning, Surrender Does Not Escape Enslavement

London, The "Daily Telegraph" says that Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, in one word, has been bound and handed over to the Nazi thugs by a weak and incompetent government. The possibility of spontaneous rebellion, even at present, cannot be eliminated, and the most likely outcome of this move is that it will give Hitler a pretext to send troops into Yugoslavia to "restore order." The example of Romania is sufficient to prove that surrender does not escape enslavement, and the example of Greece is sufficient to prove that resolute resistance can gain honor amidst difficulties. The Yugoslav prime minister disregards both, just as he disregards the assurances that Britain has issued that it is by no means impossible to provide the most powerful assistance. The Yugoslav prime minister has now allowed his country to be disposed of by Germany and has stabbed its southern allies in the back. It is expected that when the Greek people are subjected to base attacks, they will be able to deal with them with the same bravery with which they defeated Mussolini in Albania. (Reuters, 26th)

### Nazi Diplomatic Achievement in Yugoslavia, May Use Pretext to Interfere in Internal Affairs

London, A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that Yugoslavia's joining of the Tripartite Pact is of little value in terms of the form of the agreement, but it has given the German side the opportunity to create a favorable situation, which is undoubtedly a diplomatic success for the German side. It seems that the conditions obtained by Yugoslavia in signing the pact under these circumstances are extremely generous, as its agreement does not contain the provisions of the Tripartite Pact regarding military matters. Moreover, the German side's right to transport freight cars carrying war materials and wounded soldiers through Yugoslavia is of little value at present, because since the Greek army is guarding the line to Salonika in the south, this line cannot be used for transportation. The railway line passing through Nis and reaching Plovdiv is an auxiliary to other means of transportation passing through Romania and the Danube River, so this line may not occupy an important position in the near future. However, the seriousness of Yugoslavia's joining the Axis lies in opening the door for the German side to interfere in its internal affairs. Since German trains are allowed to pass through Yugoslav territory, German officials will inevitably be sent to Yugoslavia to draw up a special train schedule according to the German side's wishes, and there is a risk that unexpected events will occur, giving the German side a pretext to tighten control. Yugoslavia has now embarked on a dangerous path of concession and will find that its actions are difficult to follow its own wishes, and it will feel the great significance of the British warning. (Reuters, 26th)

### Prime Minister Returns Home From Vienna, Takes Measures to Prevent Riots

Vichy, A Vichy news agency dispatch from the Yugoslav capital reports that the Yugoslav prime minister and foreign minister will report on their trip to Vienna to Regent Prince Paul and the cabinet separately today and tomorrow. (Reuters, 26th)

Yugoslav Capital, Police and troops carrying machine guns and tear gas rushed to various parts of the country this morning to suppress various serious disturbances protesting Yugoslavia's adherence to the Tripartite Pact. The Yugoslav prime minister and foreign minister, who signed the draft in Vienna yesterday making Yugoslavia an ally of the Tripartite Pact, have returned to Yugoslavia and immediately implemented preventive measures. The capital is quiet, but many people believe that this quiet is a sign of a major riot. Many wealthy Yugoslavs have moved their families outside the capital for safety. However, the opposition does not seem to be fully organized and does not seem to have much strength, and most of its strength is concentrated within the province of Serbia. Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković returned here from Vienna after 7:00 a.m., disembarking at a suburban station, where Axis representatives and cabinet members welcomed them. The masses opposing adherence to the Axis lack a natural rallying point, that is, a leaderless mass, so a truly serious movement has not yet been realized. The German and Italian announcement that German troops will not enter Yugoslavia has deprived the opposition of its momentum, because the opposition's opposition to adherence to the Axis is based on this as a major point. (United Press, 26th)

### Soviet Union's Guarantee to Turkey Pleases the United States

Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that it is pleasing to the United States that a powerful nation such as the Soviet Union has reiterated its intention to maintain its broad neutrality if a neighboring country is attacked. The United States has adopted an active diplomatic plan to persuade Yugoslavia to reject the demands of the Axis powers. People here generally believe that the Soviet Union's guarantee to Turkey is actually an unprecedented move. (Reuters, 26th)

New York, The "New York World-Telegram" diplomatic correspondent says that the Soviet Union is concerned about Germany's control of the Dardanelles Strait, so it has reiterated its promise to Turkey. This guarantee is more powerful than it appears on the surface. (Reuters, 26th)

### Soviet Union Views Turkey as China, Will Provide Assistance to Resist Aggression

Ankara, The news circulating overseas that the Soviet Union and Turkey have recently reached an understanding stipulating that the Soviet Union will provide assistance if Turkey is attacked by Germany has not yet been confirmed here. What can be said at present is that if Turkey is attacked by Germany, then in the eyes of the Soviet Union, Turkey will not be regarded as engaging in a war of imperialism but rather as fighting to maintain its own independence. Therefore, Turkey may be regarded as being in the same position as China. The Soviet Union is one of the main suppliers of military supplies to General Chiang Kai-shek's government in its war against Japan. (Reuters, 26th)

### Independence Day Celebrated Throughout Greece, British and American Telegrams Congratulate on Final Victory in the War of Resistance, Italian Army Counterattack in Albania Suffers Another Crushing Defeat

Athens, Yesterday was the 121st anniversary of Greek independence. Towns and villages throughout Greece, as well as the front lines, celebrated with great joy. Their enthusiasm was not diminished by Yugoslavia's sale of its independence to Hitler in Vienna yesterday. In 1914, Greece gave up its neutrality for Yugoslavia. At the same time, patriotic citizens lined the streets of Athens to watch Prime Minister Koryzis lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Yesterday morning, the sun was warm, and King George of Greece, accompanied by his sister Princess Katherine (in a nurse's uniform), drove through the city streets fluttering with national flags to attend a thanksgiving prayer service in church. The prayer service was broadcast by radio to various military camps and hospitals. (Reuters, 26th)

Washington, The White House announced today that President Roosevelt exchanged telegrams with King George of Greece on Greek Independence Day. George's telegram expressed gratitude for President Roosevelt's speech on March 13, guaranteeing aid to Britain and Greece. George also said that Greek soldiers are determined to fight to the final victory. Roosevelt's reply stated that the methods used by the United States will enable free nations to fulfill their desire to improve the world. I believe that the Greek soldiers' will to victory will achieve its goal. (Haitong, 26th)

Stockholm, Yesterday was Greek Independence Day. British Foreign Secretary Eden sent a congratulatory telegram from Cairo, appealing to Greece to fight side by side with Britain to achieve final victory. (Haitong, 26th)

London, The Athens radio station announced last night that the Italian army launched two attacks in the central sector of the Albanian front yesterday, both of which were repelled. At dawn, the Italian army launched an initial attack in the area between the Apsos and Aoos rivers, retreating in defeat after fierce fighting. Then, after a heavy bombardment by the artillery, the Italian army launched another fierce attack in the morning, which was again crushed. The Italian army suffered heavy casualties and many were captured. (Reuters, 26th)

### British Wartime Spending Reaches Peak, Spending 14 Million Pounds Per Day

London, British spending reached a new record high last week. In the two weeks ending March 23, current expenditures totaled £102,699,000, averaging over £14,671,000 per day. Current revenue for the current fiscal year is £3,500,000 less than budgeted, but with nine days remaining before the end of the current fiscal year, revenue will inevitably exceed the budget. (Reuters, 26th)

### U.S. Announces Freezing of Yugoslav Funds

Washington, After Yugoslavia joined the Tripartite Pact, President Roosevelt ordered the freezing of Yugoslav deposits in the United States, worth $1 million. (United Press, 26th)

### Halifax's Speech: British War Aims - To Achieve Human Freedom and Re-Liberation, Assured of Victory with American Aid

New York - British Ambassador to the U.S., Halifax, delivered a speech last night at a banquet held by the Holy Land Pilgrims Association, stating that Britain's war and peace aims are to achieve victory, prevent the recurrence of such tragedies, and help guarantee a just and common enjoyment of future prosperity. Halifax first praised the work of former British Ambassador Lothian in seeking Anglo-American understanding, and then stated that the closeness of the two peoples' thinking led to joint action against totalitarian dictatorship, which was further strengthened by the passage of the Lend-Lease Act. Halifax pointed out that:

The Nazi System

is a method of enslaving people physically, mentally, politically, and economically. Halifax said that Hitler's New Order would divide the world's nations into two: one, the ruling Germanic people, and two, second-class citizens whose rights are determined by the ruling people. Hitler's ambition is not limited to Europe and now covets large tracts of land in Asia and Africa. If he gains hegemony in Europe, Hitler will not only invade Africa but will also quickly seize the Latin countries of South America, not allowing the Americas time to calmly build up their defenses, and will attack the Americas. Furthermore, the trading ports of Europe, Asia, and Africa will be closed unless they comply with the conditions set by the German side. In summary, if we say that the civilization we enjoy can still exist after the victory of Nazism, it is simply self-deception. We are concerned not only with material aggression but also with spiritual aggression. If we do not resist it, the harm of spiritual aggression will be more serious than the high-explosive bombs that the German Air Force can inflict on us. Therefore, we can never accept Hitler's New Order. Britain and the allied nations are making this life-and-death struggle for

Human Freedom

But if we cannot do everything humanly possible to ensure that the world does not suffer such a tragedy again, then even if victory is achieved, it will be like the result of the Dead Sea. When this great war ends in the future, all countries that maintain or restore their freedom will have an excellent opportunity to show what freedom means and what it contributes to human happiness. Although the future international structure cannot be fully elaborated at present, we can now see the foundation on which this structure will be built. All countries must be prepared to cooperate to seek their mutual overall economic well-being, and if necessary, to seek their mutual national defense. Only in this way can countries exist in freedom and security. In the economic sphere, everything depends on this kind of cooperation. However, no party must harbor the ambition to dominate other parties. All countries, large and small, will have their place and make their contributions. Past experience shows that a stable international order must accommodate the orderly changes in international relations. Individual freedom must take into account the needs of the community, and so must countries. Therefore, in the future, all countries must accept their obligations to the international community and be prepared to consider the well-being of their neighbors in political and economic terms. We are prepared to join hands with any country that faithfully fulfills its obligations and safeguards freedom within its borders, thereby seeking

World Peace

and prosperity. Any combination imposed on unwilling countries against their will is worthless. Therefore, we must find ways to create new political and economic conditions so that people can generate a true understanding of their common interests among themselves. The experience in the British Empire has shown that peoples with vastly different numbers, resources, races, and social structures can freely combine. Today, the British Empire is the cornerstone of world defense. In the future, the British Empire can be a ferry for world unity because our goal is the just and common enjoyment of prosperity. Even while fighting today, Britain is planning remedies to heal the wounds of the post-war era and is now storing food and war materials. This food can be made public when we know for sure that it will be used for healing rather than destruction. The reconstruction of post-war undertakings is a task that no one country can accomplish. Britain is determined to do its utmost, but the world's recovery depends on the joint action of all well-intentioned nations. If we cannot be sure of Germany's cooperation after the war, then what we can undoubtedly do is that countries determined to maintain peace and freedom must maintain sufficient armed forces so that their aspirations to maintain peace and freedom can be effectively realized. He hopes that the people of Britain and the United States understand their great shared responsibility in such matters; in other words, to unite justice and power so that their

Spirit of Cooperation

can win the support of other like-minded people to consolidate the foundation of world society so that Germany or any other country can no longer implement the policy of causing five wars in Europe in the past eighty years. The British ambassador then spoke about the Atlantic War, saying that in our experience, the enemy's attacks in the coming months may cause us significant losses, but our defense methods are very sound and only need to be developed with sufficient strength and speed. The coming months will see a competition between the total number of our ship losses and the increase in defensive weaponry that can reduce this number to a dangerous level. With the assistance that the United States can provide, we can undoubtedly win this competition. Some may ask if an invasion of Britain can succeed. He can resolutely answer that Britain's defenses are prepared, the morale of the British people is very strong, and the United States is providing generous assistance. (Reuters, 26th)

### British Forces Rapidly Advance in East Africa, 20 Miles from Harar; Change of Italian Generals to Change Strategy; German Mechanized Troops Appear in Libya

Cairo - British troops in Abyssinia, advancing westward from Jijiga and passing through the recently captured Marda Pass, have reached a location within 20 miles of the key city of Harar. It is heard that the battle in that area is proceeding very smoothly. If Harar, which has no strong defenses, falls, the railway from Addis Ababa to Djibouti and Dire Dawa (30 miles northwest of Harar) on that route will be severely threatened. It is estimated that 12,000 to 15,000 Italian troops are stationed in Harar and Dire Dawa under the command of General Tesimoni. British troops in southern Abyssinia, starting from Neghelli, continue to advance north along the Italian-built highway towards Agin, so the threat to Agin is increasing daily. To the northwest of Agin, patriotic Abyssinian troops under Dejazmach Beyene Merid are in contact with 18,000 Italian and indigenous troops. Fierce fighting continues in the mountainous areas around Keren in Eritrea. (Reuters, 26th)

Rome - Yesterday, observers here unanimously believed that the resignation of General Graziani, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, Governor of Libya, and Supreme Commander of the Italian forces in North Africa, indicates a new development in the Italian war in Africa. Sources close to the press claim that the lightning mechanized strategy used in Europe will replace the colonial tactics used by indigenous troops because Graziani is an Italian colonial tactician and is renowned for his ability to use colonial troops to traverse mountains. After Graziani's resignation, General Roatta was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army. He is a close friend of Mussolini and attended the Franco-Italian armistice agreement. At the same time, General Gariboldi was appointed Governor of Libya and Commander of North Africa. He is the most authoritative modern tactician in the Italian Army. (Associated Press, 26th)

Berlin - Yesterday, a British motorized reconnaissance unit in the eastern part of the Sirte Desert in North Africa encountered a German detachment transporting supplies to the base of the German-Italian forces. As a result, the British army was defeated by the German army. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)

Cairo - British General Headquarters here announced that a certain "enemy unit" has occupied the port of El Agheila between Benghazi and Tripoli in Libya, which fell on Monday after the British army withdrew. (Associated Press, 26th)

London - British military officials are now paying attention to the news that German armored units have arrived in Tripoli and that German troops have been entering the area for many days and have been reinforced recently. (Reuters, 26th)

### British Fleet in the Mediterranean Prepares for Secret Departure; Likely to Sail to the Atlantic; Part of Escort Achieves Excellent Results

Algeciras, Spain - Unconfirmed reports from British-held Gibraltar say that most of the warships of the British Mediterranean Fleet are prepared for a large-scale secret departure. According to some sources, this fleet is likely to sail to the Atlantic. (Havas, 26th)

London - It is reported that the British ships recently engaged in escorting convoys in the Mediterranean include battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and the latest aircraft carrier, "Formidable." These ships escorted merchant ships to areas near German bases with great success. The planes carried on the "Formidable" shot down a German plane attacking merchant ships west of Crete. The next day, another German plane came to spy and was also shot down. (Reuters, 26th)

### Japanese Gold Flows Steadily to the U.S.; Valued at $3 Million Last Week

Washington - Yesterday, it was announced here that U.S. gold imports this week (ending March 19) were $18,473,379, of which $3,046,111 came from Japan, $2,619,689 from South Africa, $2,386,659 from the Philippines, and $9,580,114 from Canada. (Associated Press, 28th)

### Japanese Still Express Dissatisfaction with the Tripartite Pact

Tokyo - During a recent special meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, there were mentions of the Japanese public's dissatisfaction with the Tripartite Pact. One budget committee member said that there are still many people expressing opposition to the Tripartite Pact and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. What methods does the Ministry of Home Affairs plan to use to stop this? The Minister of Home Affairs replied that we are closely monitoring this speech, but we do not want to punish it severely, lest everyone be afraid and never speak up. Another committee member, Mr. Oyama, mentioned the assassination attempt on Shingo Nakano in Osaka and the injury of one of Nakano's companions by gunfire, and asked if this incident had political motives. Hashimoto, the Chief of the Police Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs, replied that this incident had no political motives and that the assassin was a repeat offender. It is noted that Nakano recently left the Imperial Rule Assistance Association in order to restore his previously dissolved political party. The newspaper did not previously report on the assassination attempt on him in Osaka. (Reuters, 26th)

### Upcoming Election of Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Attempting to Find Harmonious Solutions; Original Rights of the British and Americans Must Be Maintained; Chinese Directors Should Have a Greater Voice; American Chamber of Commerce Discusses Equal Distribution of Seats Among British, American, and Japanese

Yesterday (26th), a member of the American Chamber of Commerce stated that the Chamber is currently discussing "various solutions" for the upcoming annual election of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, but there is no concrete decision yet. It is heard that one of the points currently being discussed by the American Chamber of Commerce is the suggestion of equal distribution of the nine seats on the Board of Directors among the American, Japanese, and British nationals, that is, the number of American and Japanese directors will each increase to three, and the remaining three seats will be for British directors. In addition, there is a proposal to advocate that the five Chinese directors should have a greater voice in the affairs of the Shanghai International Settlement.

American Chamber of Commerce to Continue Discussions Within the Week

It is heard that the American Chamber of Commerce has not yet made a definite decision, so the members of the Chamber will continue to meet within this week in order to reach a result as soon as possible. The reason why the American Chamber of Commerce is conducting this discussion is that British and Japanese nationals are currently engaged in consultations in order to reach a "gentleman's agreement" on the election of the Board of Directors this year. The British are seeking to maintain the status quo this year, but the Japanese have refused and insist that the number of Japanese directors must be increased to at least three.

Negotiation Content Remains Secret

Regarding the issue of the election of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council this year, negotiations are currently being conducted among the British, American, and Japanese sides to resolve it, but the content remains a secret. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from the Western press visited Watanabe, the vice-chairman of the Japanese Ratepayers Association, and asked about the number of directors the Japanese side is requesting, but Watanabe declined to comment, only saying that the Japanese Ratepayers Association had held a meeting to discuss the position that the Japanese side should adopt when negotiating with the representatives of foreign nationals in this city. This meeting will be concluded in a few days.

Foreign National Groups Seek Harmony

The Shanghai Times reported that various foreign national groups in this city are now taking advantage of the one-week extension of the election by the Shanghai Municipal Council to conduct negotiations in a diplomatic manner to promote "harmony" among all parties in the administration of the Shanghai International Settlement. However, it would be a great mistake to assume that the British and American foreign national groups are seeking to resolve the administrative problems of the Settlement at the cost of weakening British and American power. It is heard that the American side strongly opposes the British side's concession of allowing one more Japanese director. According to a leader of the British Association, the demands made by Japan in the past few years have been successfully dealt with. This year, the situation is different, so some people advocate forming a "gentleman's agreement" to avoid elections. If the opinions of the British and American sides can be consistent, this problem will not be difficult to solve.

Overturning the Status Quo May Be Difficult

It is understood that, according to the bylaws of the Shanghai Municipal Council, among the nine foreign directors, only the five British directors can be changed. In addition, such as one American director and five Chinese directors, are all in the case of unchangeable. The current attitude of the Japanese side is that at least one Japanese director must be added, and its attempt is to get the British to give up one of the five British seats to Japan. However, in the view of the British and American nationals, if the British directors give up one seat, the British and American directors in the Board of Directors will become insignificant for all proposals. Therefore, they resolutely oppose the concession of this one seat, otherwise it is feared that it will cause the overturning of the status quo of the Settlement.

List of Candidates Not Yet Submitted to the Council

According to the announcement issued by the Consular Body on the 7th of last month, the British, American, and Japanese nationals should submit the list of candidates for the Council directors to the general office of the Shanghai Municipal Council before 12:00 noon on the 25th of this month. However, as of yesterday (26th), none of the lists of candidates from the British, American, and Japanese nationals associations have been submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council. This is due to the ongoing behind-the-scenes negotiations between the British and Japanese sides. Although the Council director election has been extended by one week, the time is extremely pressing. Therefore, the solution to this year's Council director election must be decided by the middle of next week.

### Guillaume, Belgian Ambassador, Departs Shanghai for Hong Kong and Chongqing

Belgian Ambassador to China, Guillaume, arrived in Shanghai from Beiping on the 23rd via the Qingdao Maru of the Japanese Dalian Steamship Company. It has been four days since he arrived. In addition to inspecting the affairs of the embassy, he visits relatives and friends and attends banquets every day, which is quite busy. Because the ambassador is eager to go to Chongqing to visit the key figures of the central government, he has decided to take the American President Line's President Grant to Hong Kong this morning. The ambassador went to the ship last night because the ship had to weigh anchor in the morning. After the ambassador arrives in Hong Kong, he will have to stay for a day or two, and then he will take a plane from Hong Kong directly to Chongqing.

### Central Bank and Farmers Bank to Resume Business Soon; The Four Banks Will Not Withdraw; Rumors Spread by Speculators; Settlement Authorities Send Police to Protect Business

Since the Jiangsu Farmers Bank tragedy, the Bank of China kidnapping case, and the bombing of the Central Bank and Farmers Bank occurred one after another, the Shanghai branches and offices of the Central Bank and Farmers Bank temporarily suspended business from the day before yesterday in order to repair the damaged houses and make arrangements. They will resume business as soon as preparations are completed. The Shanghai branches and offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are operating as usual. It is heard that the joint office of the four banks, Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Farmers Bank, has received instructions from the Ministry of Finance that in order to protect the entire financial sector of Shanghai and the legitimate businesses of Chinese and foreign merchants, the Shanghai branches of the four banks will not withdraw due to coercion.

Senior Official Issues Statement

Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency visited a senior official of the Central Bank. He was not met because he was out on business. Therefore, a number of questions were left for response. The reporter received this written response yesterday morning, which is recorded below. (Reporter asked) Is it reliable to say that the four banks are withdrawing and that deposits are being made? (Answer) The withdrawal of the four banks cannot be decided by Shanghai and must wait for orders from Chongqing and Hong Kong. In fact, there is no reason for withdrawal. A few people may withdraw deposits due to panic. (Question) After this incident, what impact will it have on the financial sector in Shanghai? (Answer) The rumor that the four banks are withdrawing has given speculators the opportunity to create chaos, and it is expected that prices will rise. However, after the facts are clarified, the accidental financial disturbance caused by the bombing will return to calm. (Question) When will the Bank of China resume business? (Answer) Repairs should be completed in about two or three days and business will be resumed. Starting tomorrow (referring to the 26th), internal work may begin. (Question) How will the Bank of China handle the aftermath of the deaths and injuries of its employees? (Answer) At present, in addition to paying for the funeral expenses, all other aftermath measures must be handled by the central government. However, it can be said with certainty that preferential treatment will be given.

All Banks Will Resume Business

Reporters from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank of China, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank that (1) the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank and the Baker Road office will officially announce the resumption of business as soon as the repairs to the bombed-out houses are completed, and it is expected to open its doors no later than next Monday; (2) the Shanghai branch of the Farmers Bank of China and the Wenyi Road office will resume business as soon as arrangements are completed, and it is said that it will open its doors tomorrow; (3) the Shanghai branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has decided to resume business today (Thursday) and resume all collections.

Black Market Foreign Exchange Remains Unchanged

The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank publishes the legal foreign exchange rate and the collection balance tax rate at 10:00 am every day. Although the bank is temporarily closed due to the bombing, the listing has been temporarily suspended during the holiday period, but this does not affect the foreign exchange and financial market. The black market exchange rate in Shanghai is listed by the British HSBC Bank every day and remained unchanged yesterday. However, the actual transaction rate in the black market fluctuates from time to time due to rumors, which is not enough to be true. It is also heard that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is still cooperating with HSBC China Bank to maintain the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai and has not changed its established policy.

U.S. Marines Deployed to Enforce Order

The 4th Marine Regiment of the U.S. Marines in Shanghai increased patrols by soldiers dispatched by Colonel Baker starting yesterday, and also added sentries to the posts to carry out strict guard. In addition, a large team of sergeants was dispatched in front of the doors of the four banks, Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, in the defense zone, with two to ten people in a group, fully armed, to take surveillance and guard. This measure is to assist the police authorities in prevention. Soldiers of the U.S. Marine Corps can be seen patrolling every few steps along Jing'an Temple Road, with a team of U.S. Marines with guns. Five U.S. Marines are stationed in the Central Bank area on Baker Road. This measure will not be withdrawn in the short term.

Banks Strictly Protected

The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have decided to protect the businesses of the four banks, Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, as well as various commercial banks and provincial banks. Therefore, starting yesterday, in front of each branch and office of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in the Concession, in addition to one or two members of the White Russian Merchant Corps armed with guns stationed there, four Chinese detectives were dispatched to patrol nearby to provide defense. However, U.S. Marine Corps soldiers are stationed in front of the banks in the U.S. Marine Corps defense zone. The French Concession authorities took the same steps as the Public Concession authorities. At the same time, the bank authorities have also made proper arrangements for prevention themselves, and all the bodyguards and security guards they employ have been dispatched to carry out strict guard, and special attention is paid to customers who have valuables.

### U.S. Military Commander in North China Departs Shanghai for the U.S.; Colonel Thorne, Recalled to the Navy Department

Colonel Thorne, Commander of the U.S. Garrison in North China and military attaché of the U.S. Embassy in Beiping, was ordered to return to the Navy Department in Washington to take up his post. He arrived in Shanghai in mid-month by the Beijing liner from Tianjin and had been busy with banquets and frequent contact with the U.S. officials in this port. It is now known that after Colonel Thorne completed his official and private affairs in Shanghai, he left Shanghai for the U.S. on the President Taft of the American Mail Steamship Company at 10:00 am yesterday. Colonel Baker, Commander of the 4th Fleet of the U.S. Marines, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, U.S. Consul General Lockhart, and many other private friends of Colonel Thorne went to the Xinzha Wharf to see him off, giving flowers or taking photos before parting. After Colonel Thorne shook hands with the people who were seeing him off, he boarded the ferryboat Marilyn Miller to transfer to the big ship. It is learned that Colonel Thorne will first land in San Francisco, stay there briefly, and then leave for Washington to take up his new post. Colonel Baker, Commander of the U.S. Forces in this port, will also be ordered to return to the country, but his departure date is not yet determined.

### Japanese Abduct 200 Workers on Yidingpan Road Yesterday; However, the Japanese Military Authorities Still Claim Ignorance

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that, according to reports received today, the Japanese military authorities sent people to Yidingpan Road yesterday afternoon to abduct 200 Chinese workers. According to Chinese reports, the purpose of the Japanese army's abduction of a large number of workers was to force the workers to work for the Japanese garrison in this city, but the Japanese authorities denied it, saying that they were not aware of this incident. "Police officers" also said that they knew nothing about it.

### Public Transportation in the French Concession Resumed Yesterday; Improved Treatment Conditions Still to Be Negotiated; Public Transportation in the United Areas May Also Be Restored This Morning

The labor strike at the French Tram Company, after mediation, resumed work yesterday morning. All of the company's buses and trams also left at 5:30 am yesterday, and the public transportation that had been suspended for a week was finally restored. At the same time, the water and electricity workers also resumed work yesterday.

Negotiating Conditions

It is heard that there are two conditions for the workers to resume work this time: (1) The arrested worker, Ah Mao Ni, must be released first; (2) Negotiations must begin immediately after resuming work to resolve the improved treatment conditions put forward by the workers. Both of the above conditions were fully accepted by the capital side, and negotiations on improved treatment conditions are also scheduled to be held at 5:00 pm today at the company on Rue Lyons. As for the statement in the newspapers yesterday that the company would give a total of sixty yuan in rice subsidies, there is no such thing and it must be decided after negotiations.

White Russians Dismissed

After the company authorities ordered the workers to strike, in addition to the suspension of buses and trams, the water and electricity sector, because it involved the lives of residents in the concession, temporarily hired more than a hundred White Russian workers to continue working. The supply of water and electricity in the concession was maintained as usual during the strike. Yesterday, because the labor strike had been resolved, all the temporarily hired White Russian workers were dismissed.

Public Transportation

Public transportation between the two concessions was not able to resume yesterday because the French Water and Electricity Company did not notify the Public Concession Tram Company authorities the day before yesterday. It is now heard that the notification from the French Electric Company was also issued yesterday, so the connection of public transportation between the two concessions is expected to resume this morning.

### Manipulating Coal Dust: Small Coal Ball Factories Request Intervention

Because someone is manipulating large quantities of white smoke coal dust, the market price has soared. The price of coal balls has been raised to a new high of $226 per ton, causing public outcry and resentment. There is a unanimous call for punishing unscrupulous coal market brokers. Small coal ball factories in this city, including Yixin, Hongji, Beiyang, Lixing, and Yanyan, have jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Mechanical Coal Ball Industry Association, reporting the coal hoarding brokers and appealing for assistance. The letter states: "Since the European situation has become tense and the situation in Shanghai is increasingly serious, speculation and manipulation have become common. Although coal is a necessity for people's daily lives, this phenomenon is unavoidable. Recently, the supply of coal dust has been continuous, but raw material dealers such as Yitaixing, Yicheng, and Tongcheng refuse to sell their hoarded goods, making their motives inscrutable. They even refuse to sell to small factories that they usually deal with. The suffering of our small coal ball factories is unspeakable. Outsiders, unaware of the situation, believe that our industry is making huge profits. However, small factories are limited by their financial resources and usually do not have sufficient inventory. Currently, we have no raw materials to purchase, and the shutdown of our machines is imminent. Once the small factories stop working, what will become of the thousands of workers? Social order is also at stake. We have long admired your leadership in the industry, and in this dire situation, you should step forward and take on this responsibility. We urge you to negotiate effectively with the aforementioned raw material dealers so that they can provide a continuous supply, allowing our small coal ball factories to overcome this difficult situation. We would be deeply grateful for your merits. Yesterday, the price of coal balls rose again by $40 per ton, and various sectors are complaining and blaming the coal ball industry for speculating. In reality, the price of raw materials has risen due to manipulation, and even at a price of $120, raw materials cannot be purchased. We ask, who should be blamed for this situation? Any discerning person can see that small factories have no raw materials and should not be held responsible. The manipulators are the raw material dealers. The current state of small factories is one of heavy losses. Therefore, we report our suffering to you and request your judgment. We also hope for an early reply. We are truly grateful. Addressed to: Chairman of the Shanghai Mechanical Coal Ball Industry Association."

### Japan Creating Opportunities: Foreigners Expose Conspiracy; Fabricating Rumors to Divide China Internally; Aim Achieved, Then War Against the U.S.

Yesterday, a person named U.F. Tanner sent a letter to the North-China Daily News, stating that in light of the recent developments in the international situation, it is clear that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka's trip to Berlin was a provocative act against the U.S. Congress's passage of the Lend-Lease Act. It is now worthwhile to briefly discuss Japan's changing Pacific policy. Currently, Japan has two main enemies to deal with in the Far East: the United States and China.

Japan Attempts to Exploit Opportunities

Regarding Japan's policy towards the U.S., even the extremists in Japan are hesitant and dare not risk an immediate war with the U.S. However, the Japanese still hope to take progressive action under more favorable conditions. The so-called more favorable conditions are the "possible" success of Hitler's spring offensive in Europe, and the weakening of China's strength due to internal conflict. Japan is currently doing everything possible to achieve this goal.

Fabricating Rumors to Agitate Public Opinion

Matsuoka's trip was nothing more than to find out Hitler's intentions, seek the assistance of the Axis leader, and try to contact the Soviet Union. At the same time, Japan has realized that conquering China is impossible, because the Chinese people are determined to fight to the end, and the U.S. aid to China is increasing. Therefore, Japan is conspiring to expand the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Japanese newspapers exaggerate the "Kuomintang-Communist conflict" issue, even fabricating rumors and spreading false information that Chongqing has formulated a military plan to wipe out the Communist base in Yan'an, and that General He Yingqin will be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the anti-communist campaign.

Conspiracy Achieved, War Will Begin

Japan dreams of using the conservative elements in Chongqing to reach a compromise, believing that if this happens, China will again fall into civil war and be unable to continue fighting against Japan. At that time, Britain and the U.S. will lose an "ally" and will have to stop aiding China. Japan almost hopes to complete this conspiracy and then fight against the U.S. We foreigners living in China have a responsibility to inform our fellow countrymen and Chinese friends of the truth.

### Bank of China 100 Yuan Notes Without Place Name Are Acceptable

Bank of China 100 yuan notes have been circulating a lot recently. They are divided into those with no place name and those with the name Chongqing. Because all of these notes were issued in Chongqing, the Shanghai branch used to refuse to accept them due to concerns that funds would flow into the occupied areas. Strict inspections were allowed for damaged, folded, torn, and stained notes. In recent days, the bank has slightly relaxed its policy on 100 yuan notes with no place name. However, notes with the Chongqing place name can only be remitted to Chongqing and cannot be used otherwise.

### Sasebo Japanese Navy to Hold Major Maneuvers; Nagasaki and Fukuoka Refuse Foreigners; Airplane and Ship Tickets All Suspended Yesterday; Japanese Army on Kyushu Island Also to Hold Exercises

Yesterday (the 16th), it was learned that the Japanese authorities had recently banned foreign tourists from traveling to Nagasaki by ship and from flying to Fukuoka for about three weeks.

The ban on foreigners purchasing ship tickets is from March 30th to April 10th, and the suspension of ticket sales to foreigners for airplanes is from yesterday until April 8th. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Japanese Consulate authorities seemed unaware of this. According to an official at the Japanese Consulate, the consulate is still approving foreigners to go to Nagasaki. However, yesterday morning, foreigners who wanted to go to Nagasaki and buy tickets from Japanese shipping companies were all rejected. They will have to wait until after April 10th to buy tickets. As for those who want to go to other ports in Japan, ship tickets can still be purchased as usual. In addition, Japan Airlines, which operates regular passenger air services between Shanghai and Fukuoka, has been refusing to sell tickets to foreigners in this city who want to go to Fukuoka since yesterday until April 8th. It is said that the Japanese Navy will depart from Sasebo Naval Base in the next few days to hold large-scale maneuvers, and the Army will also hold exercises on Kyushu Island.

Japanese Shipping Industry Denies to the Outside World

The Japanese shipping industry in this area yesterday denied the report in a certain Western evening newspaper that the Japanese shipping companies in this city refused to sell tickets to foreigners traveling to Fukuoka. At the same time, the Japanese consulate in Shanghai also denied knowing about this matter. According to people in the Japanese shipping company, this news is new to them, and they said that ship tickets to Nagasaki can be purchased for any week. Japanese consular officials in Shanghai said that the consulate is still issuing passports to foreigners to go to Nagasaki.

### Grain: Foreign Rice Slightly Affected by Strong Arrival; Hoarders' Silver Funding Turnover Inevitably Tricky

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Sichuan ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday evening, carrying 17,371 bags from Hong Kong. Yesterday, the French ship Albert Sarrant, managed by the Hua Lun Foreign Company, arrived from Saigon carrying 2,800 tons of broken rice, totaling 26,971 bags. It arrived at the Pudong Hongsheng Wharf yesterday morning and docked to unload. In addition, the French Company's D'Artagnan postal ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying more than 70,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, docking at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf to unload. (Zu)

Since foreign rice is arriving strongly and the posted price is high, the market is seizing this opportunity and observing slightly. In a few days, the total amount of rice that has arrived, been unloaded, and is waiting to be unloaded is no less than nearly 200,000 bags. Calculating the silver funding for this rice amounts to about 20 million yuan, plus the closure of the four banks, turnover is not as easy as before. Most of the scattered hoarders, due to insufficient strength, are eager to sell off as the market dictates. Therefore, the opening price in the morning saw a sharp drop, and as the supply was large and sales were slow, the market continued to fall. However, the afternoon price drop prompted local customers to buy more and cover their short positions, and rumors favored the buyers, so the evening closing was slightly firm. It is estimated that small jiaozhi has fallen from 3,600-700 yuan to 3,300 yuan. Zhongguan is only posting 3,100 yuan. No. 1 Saigon Gao fell from 3,200 yuan to 2,900 yuan, and finally to 2,600-700 yuan. No. 2 Saigon fell from 3,300-400 yuan to around 3,000 yuan. Broken Point is posting 2,200-300 yuan. As for other items, such as Siamese Huo Jiao, they failed to open. In short, compared to the previous market, the spread was sold off sharply by 500-600 yuan, equivalent to a drop of 4-5 yuan per dan (unit of weight).

The arrival of domestic rice such as Hou Bo Geng is still not much, and the thinking of both buyers and sellers has turned weak due to the sharp drop in the foreign rice market. Therefore, as the sales market has slackened, the intention to sell has also loosened, and all prices continue to be difficult to establish a foothold, continuing to depreciate by about 2 yuan. Changbang Hu sees a special white geng opening at 123-4 yuan, and ordinary at 120 yuan. Kunshan Hu sees a white geng gao from 118 yuan, finally to 111 yuan. Qingjiao Hu sees a thin rice at 112 yuan, 111 yuan and a half, and the original package is 16 yuan.

In this environment, glutinous rice should also be restricted. Under the eagerness of the cargo owner to sell off, the market price immediately fell sharply by 3-4 yuan. The opening of Hong Kong Baiyuan Gao fell from 105 yuan to 101 yuan, and Glutinous Tea from 95 yuan to 87-88 yuan.

### Flour Market Prospects Will Depend on Camp Flour

Yesterday, the foreign flour market continued to weaken, because foreign sources were following up. In addition to the Australian flour transferred from Hong Kong, totaling 100,000 bags, more than 200,000 bags of Camp flour will arrive in port today and tomorrow. People in the industry are all pessimistic. However, foreign gang hoarders are still buying a lot. Hua Niao Zhong Lou brand Australian flour, because the packages are often broken and the inventory is gradually decreasing, is not welcomed by speculators, and the price has fallen to 29 yuan 20 cents, a sharp drop of one yuan compared to before. Jinlong brand Camp flour once fell below the 29 yuan mark, but then scattered households absorbed it at a low price, and the price returned to the 29 yuan mark. Its price has already been parallel with Australian flour. Judging from the quality of the flour, there should be a difference of about one yuan. However, at present, the importers are greedy for its complete package and the availability of inventory, and are actually using it as a speculative chip. It is said that there are a total of more than one million bags of Camp flour ordered. Therefore, the future foreign flour market will be based on Camp flour.

Wheat was calm yesterday. Checks show that there were no domestic or foreign sources, and all flour mills have no reliance on raw materials. Japanese factories are buying as needed and are not adopting a normal attitude. It is said that the current market price of high-quality durum wheat has reached 50 yuan, while the price received by Japanese factories is about 45-46 yuan, with occasional sporadic additions only.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Strong Externally, Weak Internally

Yesterday, the soybean oil market opened in the morning, continuing the fatigue of the previous day, and fell by a price unit. Afterwards, due to the exchange rate relationship, costs increased, and cargo owners sold in an unadulterated manner, causing futures to rise again, resulting in an increase of 3-4 yuan compared to the previous market, while spot only rose by about half a yuan, and factory oil fell by half a yuan. Therefore, the overall situation is still one of poor actual sales, inevitably strong externally and weak internally. It is estimated that 200 dans of factory oil were transacted, priced at 102 yuan, and 100 barrels of Dalian oil were transacted, priced at 138 yuan 50 cents. A contract was also placed for 3,000 barrels for delivery in April, priced at 136 yuan 50 cents to 140 yuan 25 cents, and a contract for 1,000 barrels for delivery in May, priced at 138 yuan 75 cents to 143 yuan. Peanut oil was raised by 2-3 yuan by human sentiment, and 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were transacted, priced at 118-120 yuan, 50 pieces of Yantai oil were transacted, priced at 113 yuan 50 cents, 200 cans of canned oil were priced at 156 yuan, and 3,000 cans of canned Jiangbei Benfang oil were priced at 152 yuan. Today, 1,375 bags of soybeans and 200 pieces of soybean cake will be shipped to Singapore.

The Central Government has allocated funds to relieve the hard life of the education community in Shanghai. All of us are deeply grateful for the German intention, but the relief of the life of education staff should be universal and fair.

After discussion, it was considered that it was doubtful that Xingdao Nengwu could arrive before the game, if it happened to return to Hong Kong one day before the game, all the goods were unloaded, and the spirit was related to the labor of the journey. It is also a problem to arrange two lineups for all-round consideration and to formulate a compromise. If Xingdao arrives before the 14th, the first lineup is used, otherwise the second lineup is applied. In the first lineup, three players from Xingdao are selected. In the second team, all are composed of Guanghua, Dongfang and Nanhua. The three major championships in which the Hong Kong Hualian participated have lost two, and the Governor's Constitution Cup is the only one that survives. Only hope that the selected players will not humiliate their mission. The first team is the ideal team, and the second team is the possible team. The arrangement is as follows,

### Life: An Inspiration from a Pair of Letters

— Cheng Jun

In my life, I have only had one female friend, and I rescued her from the trap of depression and negativity. I have done the most sincere, noble, and friendly act in the world, which is enough glory in my life history.

She was a young woman, one year younger than me, and a classmate from my university days. The year we graduated, her father and mother passed away one after another. She hurriedly returned to her hometown of Jinhua to handle the funeral affairs, and then hurriedly came to Shanghai to participate in the graduation exams. Back and forth, no one noticed the dramatic changes in her psychology. Because she was a taciturn and thoughtful person, coupled with her frail body, she would not be noticed in a class. As for me, I maintained considerable affection for every classmate, but I was particularly concerned about her, not for any ulterior motives, but because of a connection in writing. It turned out that she had extremely high literary talent, excelling in poetry and novels. I usually also liked to appreciate and write literary works that others considered insignificant skills, but I preferred sharp and concise essays and prose. For this reason, I often exchanged writing techniques with her, and I knew her more deeply than anyone else—except for her parents.

That year, the death of her parents made her an orphan. She barely managed to complete the school exams. The day after the exams, while our class of more than forty young hearts were holding a tea party to celebrate, her slender figure was nowhere to be seen. We were all surprised, fearing that she had destroyed herself. That day, the cheerful atmosphere became gloomy, and everyone speculated about the possible consequences. But I remained silent, because I knew that she would notify me in advance no matter what—before she destroyed herself or ran away. I was just waiting for good news.

The next morning, I indeed received her letter. It turned out that she was preparing to wander and drift to spend her life. She wrote so sadly: "The ups and downs of my thoughts and the changes in my moods are beyond my own control. I am a weakling, and I no longer have the strength to fight for life and struggle with the environment. I wish to get rid of everything and let this fragile life end quickly... Friend, let us shake hands for the last time here! I am leaving tomorrow, and I have not decided where to go. Anyway, I am like a duckweed that has lost its parents, rising and falling, who cares?..." I read it word by word. I was not surprised, because this was the life attitude inevitably formed by her living situation and fragile heart!

But I felt I had a responsibility to save her. I boldly went to her apartment. She was packing her luggage. When I saw her busy scene, I greeted her lightly and stood aside. Finally, I spoke first, asking her where she was going and whether she had any job, etc. But her answers were still the same as those in the previous letter. However, she seemed to say a little more as if seeking something: "If there were a job in Shanghai, I would still like to stay for a year or two, because there are still many young friends here." "I will definitely find a way for you," I said, "No matter what, you must wait two weeks before leaving." She agreed, and I left her apartment without any nostalgia.

After returning home, I immediately wrote a letter to her: "...Those who have lost their parents are indeed lonely, but they can never be said to be isolated. Because family is a narrow prison, we should go to the vast society, like gold diggers tirelessly extracting the essence of life. Loneliness and suffering are enough to forge a person's ability to live. The world will never be forever submerged in the gloomy winter, and the warm spring will come... Rather than living a gray, cold, and painful life, why not live a happy and passionate life... Friend, you are still young, I hope you can cheer up again and live a meaningful life." At the same time, within two weeks, I found her a Chinese language teaching position at a girls' middle school. She accepted my recommendation and stayed there for a year and a half. And I also encouraged her to write and read books at any time to shift her solitary mood. She mostly accepted my advice and gradually became more positive.

During the winter vacation last semester, she said goodbye to me and went to Fujian. Because of the introduction of a friend of her father's, she became an assistant editor in the literary supplement of a newspaper there. I just received her letter the day before yesterday. She said: "Although it is very busy here, it is all work that I am willing to do, so I am very happy. I now have two completely different attitudes towards life from before. I have to thank you for saving me from the quagmire of boredom. You are my most sincere friend in my life... I also hope that you will write more about Shanghai and send it to me."

Yes, she is still an orphan now, but not a world-weary orphan. I saved her, and I felt the joy of victory.

### Last Words

— Li Ni

George Miller Beard, a famous American physician and scientist, his last words were: "I would like to record the thoughts of a dying man, which may also be beneficial to science, but unfortunately it is impossible!"

Rabelais was a playwright, and these words floated on his lips as he died: "Put down the curtain! The comedy is over!"

When Louis XIV was eighty years old and death came to him, he saw people sobbing around him and shouted, "What are you crying about? Didn't you think I would live forever?" When Washington was dying, he said to his secretary, "I am leaving! Put me in the coffin hastily and bury me in two days, do you understand? That's good enough!"

US President Wilson's last words were: "I am ready!"

(5) The Division Between Love and Desire

"Yuan Baofan may have the ability to deceive my body, but he cannot deceive my heart, let alone make me forget everything in the past!" Luo Xiangqi's words gradually became passionate and indignant. "From the day my mother discovered his scam, her illness worsened. On the one hand, she hated him, and on the other hand, she felt too sorry for me, so she refused to stay there again. My father and I sent her back, so that she could breathe her last breath in her own home." Although more than a year had passed, Xiangqi could not help but have red eyes when she mentioned this matter.

In this passage, Begonia really felt unable to interject, and could only continue to sit quietly and listen.

"Because this house is where my mother closed her eyes, and the happiest days I have ever had in my life were spent here, I decided to keep it; I even used his money to renovate it completely, so it looks newer than before." As she spoke, a bitter smile appeared on Xiangqi's face. "My father has also been living here, until recently when he took a sum of money to the south to see my brother."

"Does Yuan Zhenshoushi often come...?" Begonia began to ask, but immediately felt too abrupt and quickly swallowed his words.

"He has never been here," Xiangqi already knew what he wanted to ask. "This is also what I agreed with him in front of Mrs. Hu Canjun. He can defile my body, but he can no longer defile my family! Now, everything here is the same as it was a year ago. It is quiet every day with no visitors. The watchman is still the deaf and dumb girl. When he was still a child in Tianjin, I lived here a lot. Our food, clothing, and expenses are all the same as before: it's just that I, this one person, is no longer a pure girl..."

Speaking of this, Xiangqi's voice had become extremely bitter, which made Begonia immediately arouse a sense of pity and indignation from the bottom of his heart.

He supported his chin with one hand, staring at Xiangqi's face without blinking for almost five minutes without moving his sight; Xiangqi also seemed unaware, just looking at the few calligraphy and paintings on the opposite wall, unknowingly both of them were lost in thought. (65)

### The Procedure of Reading

— Zhao Sheng

The world-renowned writer Maugham (W.S. Maugham) tells us: To read books on science and philosophy, one should do it in the morning before starting work, because both of these things require a fresher and more concentrated mind. Later, when your work is over, and you feel a little tired; at this time, it is best to read books on history, commentary, and biography. The time for reading novels should be left for the evening. In addition, you can prepare a few more collections of poetry, so that you can appreciate them whenever occasional joy occurs.

They tell us to cultivate the habit of reading. Books can help us solve many difficult problems that we may encounter on the road of life. (Translated from Maugham's original book "The Summing Up")

The Struggle between the Two Lis: The struggle between Li Wanchun and Li Shaochun used to be called the struggle between the two Lis. The current struggle between the two Lis does not refer to the struggle between Wanchun and Shaochun, but refers to the struggle between Li Wanchun and Li Hongchun. The reason is that Li Wanchun went to Shanghai last year, but failed to travel with Hongchun. Hongchun was originally a mainstay in Wanchun's troupe. Since then, Hongchun abandoned Wanchun and cooperated with the martial artist Li Shengbin, specializing in performing the plays performed by Wanchun. When Wanchun returned north, he saw that Hongchun intended to challenge him, so he was unwilling to show weakness, and fought against Li Shengbin and Li Hongchun. Li Hongchun rehearsed ten episodes of "Iron Rooster", and Li Wanchun rehearsed twenty episodes of "Iron Rooster". Under the confrontation between the two sides, Li Hongchun's "Iron Rooster" has been rehearsed to the "Fortieth Episode". In addition to the protagonist Li Shengbin, the actors also include He Yuqin from the opera school, and Mao Qinglai, Li Wanchun's old partner. According to Li Wanchun's visit to the south last year, Mao Qinglai did not accompany him, but Wanchun claimed to the outside world that Mao was in Ping to preside over the Mingchun She opera class organized by him, and had no time to come south. In fact, Mao and Li had already fallen out. In addition to joining Li Shaochun's troupe, who was Wanchun's enemy, Mao is now cooperating with Li Shengbin and Li Hongchun, which undoubtedly demonstrates to Wanchun. Judging from this situation, it can be seen that it is difficult for Mao and Li to reconcile.

The Whereabouts of the Actors: Recently, there are no good operas to listen to in the old capital. The reason is that the major famous actors have successively gone to other places to perform. Cheng Yanqiu went to Qingdao, Xun Huisheng went to Shanghai, Ma Lianliang went to Jinan, Tan Fuying went to Tianjin, and Yan Jupeng went to Nanjing. Those currently performing in Ping, in addition to the troupes of Shang Xiaoyun, Jin Shaoshan, and Xi Xiaobo, are all female roles or inexplicable characters. The situation is not very prosperous.

Chapter 4: Swallows Kick Flying Flowers, Falling on the Dance Mat

The female performer sold her skills singing and dancing on the rope for a while, already showing her graceful waist and lively skills, but she was still standing up there and not coming down. The gongs and drums below were also beating urgently. A burly man with his chest bare led a white horse over and stopped under the rope waiting. The young woman suddenly turned over and fell down from the rope. Everyone was worried that she would lose her footing and fall to the ground, but they saw that when she turned over, her small feet had already hooked onto the rope. Her body was hanging upside down under the rope, shaking a few times, like a willow swaying in the wind. Everyone couldn't help but cheer. After the woman hung on the rope, she took off one foot, leaving only one foot hooked on the rope, like a dragonfly hanging. The gongs and drums beat even louder. She twisted the rope under the rope, turning a windmill, quickly turning seventeen or eighteen times. The gong sounded non-stop, and her body turned non-stop. Everyone watched with admiration and longing, sweating for her. She spun more than thirty times, and the eyes of the crowd blurred. Suddenly, like a glimpse, her body fell like a small bird. Everyone thought she was going to fall again and shouted "Ah!" Who knew that the woman was standing properly on the back of the horse. The burly man slapped the horse's butt with the whip, and the horse immediately carried the woman and walked around the field in circles. After walking around once, the woman leaned back again, supporting the horse's back with both hands, her body standing straight upside down, and the horse ran. Xu Jing watched and said to Li Xin: "Don't underestimate this skill-selling woman, her skills are not bad, she is really as light as a swallow. I remember the Tang poem has this sentence: 'Blowing fine waves shakes the song fan, swallows kick flying flowers falling on the dance mat', this woman can sing and dance, but falls into the dust, what a pity!" Li Xin watched with great interest and said: "Is that so! It's a pity that Chen Fei took the first step and left, otherwise his light body skills are very good, he can let him compete with this red-clothed girl." While the two were talking, the woman's horse had run to the front of the two. The woman turned over, still standing on the horse, glanced at the two, smiled sideways, intentionally or unintentionally, Xu Jing looked at her and smiled at Li Xin. Li Xin also felt that the skill-selling woman had already paid attention to the two of them. (22)
