### America Intensifies Military Preparations with Resolve to Prevent Japanese Southern Advance; Advanced Post on Philippine Island Establishes Far East Military Headquarters; Hawaii Fleet Sails to Secret Destination

United Press, Washington, 27th – Former US Army Chief of Staff and current Military Advisor to the Philippine Government, General MacArthur, was yesterday appointed Commander of the newly established US Far East Army. He will temporarily hold the rank of Lieutenant General and command the US and Philippine Island troops. President Roosevelt's order appears to be a new measure against Japan following the freezing of Japanese funds. This order was issued after President Roosevelt ordered the integration of non-island land and air force personnel into the US military in times of emergency. US Army authorities in Manila stated that President Roosevelt's order to integrate the non-island army into the US military would effectively add approximately 200,000 troops, and that the mobilized reserve force could double this number. General MacArthur will establish his headquarters in Manila. This move not only puts the Philippine army in a state of war, but President Roosevelt's order is indeed a "military command," it is said.

It is heard from reliable sources that the plan to incorporate the Philippine army into the US military was agreed upon by US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, and Philippine President Quezon. This is also another indication of the US dissatisfaction with Japan's actions in the Pacific.

Reuters, Manila, 27th – The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the US Far East Army, Lieutenant General MacArthur, stated to reporters today that the sole significance of the US government's establishment of this new command is that the US intends to maintain all of its rights in the Far East at any cost and with every effort. The determination of the US is unchangeable and its will is insurmountable, all of which are very clear facts and need not be elaborated upon. To achieve this goal, the soldiers of the US and the Philippines will each do their best. He is particularly pleased to be able to serve the country during this critical period, he said. Reuters, New York, 27th – According to a dispatch from the "New York Times" in Washington, it is widely rumored in Washington that the US Pacific Fleet has sailed from Hawaii, and the garrison in Hawaii is on alert. It would be very surprising if the US fleet were not fully prepared.

Special Dispatch from Washington, 26th – Roosevelt today ordered the incorporation of 150,000 Philippine troops into the US Army. This order is almost a follow-up to the freezing of Japanese funds. Far East US Army Commander MacArthur declared that the US has now expressed its determination to oppose Japan's southern advance, and is determined to use even more severe economic weapons to protect the government's policies. Washington officials are paying close attention to the news from London that the US fleet has sailed west from Hawaii. It is rumored that the US fleet may have sailed to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, but reporters have not yet obtained confirmation from the Navy Department. Other officials are also silent. Observers say that even if the above news is true, it is impossible to find out the truth from the Navy Department. During emergencies, the movements of the US fleet are kept secret.

Reuters, Honolulu, 27th – US Under Secretary of the Navy Forrestal and Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Rear Admiral Towers, arrived here today from San Francisco aboard a Navy aircraft. According to Forrestal, this trip is for a general inspection.

United Press, Honolulu, 27th – US Under Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, Chief of the Naval Aviation Bureau Towers, and three special commissioners of the Department of the Treasury flew here yesterday from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. When a United Press reporter met with them, he said that the world situation is currently tense and the forces in Hawaii are all on alert. His arrival here is timely. Forrestal replied, "Yes, judging from the situation, our measures in certain major matters seem to be correct. When the world is in great turmoil, you should know that you are in a very important place, and so are we." Forrestal also said that General Towers may be under the command of the commanders of the US fleet, and may return to the US after inspecting here.

Reuters, London, 27th – Acting Lieutenant General, Major General Norton, has been appointed commander of the Hong Kong artillery.

### Canada Detains Japanese Ship

United Press, Ottawa, 27th – After freezing Japanese funds, the Canadian government detained the Japanese mail ship "Flora" yesterday. The ship was loaded with a large quantity of pine wood and was about to sail from Vancouver back to Japan.

Havas, Ottawa, 6th – According to political figures here, trade between Canada and Japan is about to be interrupted. In the first half of this year, Canadian exports to Japan totaled $4,344,000, compared to $6,922,000 in the same period last year.

### Ominous Clouds in the South Pacific; Australia, New Zealand, Dutch East Indies Prepare to Respond to Changes

United Press, Sydney, 27th – Australian Navy Minister Hughes declared yesterday that the situation in the Pacific in recent days or weeks cannot be predicted. However, he said that Australia's position is serious. Hughes said in a speech at a launching ceremony of a warship at a shipyard in New South Wales, "The sky has turned black." Interior Minister Sir Stewart said that Australia has held close discussions regarding the actions resulting from Japan's occupation of Vietnam. He said that Japan's claim that its actions are aimed at preventing the occupation of Vietnam by Britain and the United States is "absurd." He said that Japan is imitating Germany's "methods of argumentation," indicating the closeness of its relationship with the Axis powers.

Reuters, Manchester, 27th – New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser visited Manchester yesterday and predicted that war would break out in the Far East, saying that devils from hell may soon appear in New Zealand. "We will fight to the end to protect our land," he said. Fraser praised the strong and unyielding spirit of Britain and Manchester.

Reuters, London, 20th – The Dutch government in London is currently discussing with the Dutch East Indies authorities plans to deal with the situation arising from Japan's occupation of Vietnam. According to responsible sources, Japan has repeatedly declared that its aim is to maintain the status quo in the Pacific, but the policies it has recently adopted have been cut off from those of its Axis partners. This is an undeniable secret. Any action by Japan is sufficient to change the status quo and cause damage to us and our allies, but it is inevitable that Japan will not stop its actions. Therefore, we will inevitably be placed in a dangerous situation. We are prepared to shed blood and accept this worrying situation. We are all aware of this and keep it deeply in our hearts." Yesterday afternoon, when the radio announced the "air raid alert in Batavia," an air defense exercise was held, followed by a sharp siren, and all streetcars stopped after ten minutes. Most Dutch people are very calm about the current situation, because they deeply understand the significance of acquiring Cam Ranh Bay and Saigon. Reliable sources point out that Japan's strategic situation will focus on India and Singapore, but because of the Philippine Islands, Japan must first attack the Philippine Islands before advancing south. He said, "I firmly believe that the United States will step in to intervene, and Britain will take the same action." As for the Netherlands, we have decided to freeze Japanese funds, which will be implemented only after its government in London obtains the permission of Queen Wilhelmina and its cabinet. However, it is believed that the Netherlands will immediately implement this measure after Britain and the United States.

### Japan Uses Both Enticement and Coercion to Demand Thailand Join the Bloc; Eden's Respect for Non-Aggression Agreement Has a Good Impression on Thai People

United Press, Chongqing, 27th – The Chinese Army Operations Department said last night that, according to reports, a report from the country stated that Japan is about to use various bases in Vietnam. Britain will not carry dozens of passengers. Rumors that the ship was sailing to Mexico and that the US Navy or Coast Guard would unload passengers at sea have not been confirmed.

Reuters, Hong Kong, 27th – The Japanese mail ship Nitta Maru (which was supposed to arrive here from Manila yesterday) and the cargo ship Nagata Maru have both changed their routes, but it is not yet known whether the subsequent schedules of the Japanese ships have been completely cancelled. It is no different from the Dutch government's inability to ignore it. The Dutch government cannot easily believe Japan's claim that Britain and the United States threatened Vietnam, so Japan had to occupy Vietnamese ports and bases.

### Dutch East Indies Enhances Defense Capabilities; Military Training Intensified

International News Service, Batavia – It was announced here yesterday that a large number of US-made Catalina flying boats will soon join the Dutch East Indies Air Force. These flying boats have a range of over 3,700 miles and will fly to the Dutch East Indies from California via Hawaii, Guam, and Manila. It is said that a few weeks ago, when the German battleship "Bismarck" was destroyed in the Atlantic, the Catalina played a major role.

United Press, Batavia, 27th – Exercises by the Dutch army were almost completely cancelled yesterday, as the situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense due to Japan's sudden invasion of Vietnam and the United States' announcement of the freezing of Japanese funds. However, it is heard that the decision here is that if there is sufficient training time, the Dutch East Indies army will continue to conduct exercises. The nighttime blackout plan was also not implemented yesterday due to the merchants' protest against losing their normal nighttime business. This matter was announced temporarily by the radio station at 1:00 p.m. The Dutch Saigon air route has been cut off by the French, but no reason has been given. The Dutch authorities in Batavia are prepared to cope with serious Japanese pressure. The newspapers here believe that the situation is extremely serious. The military leisure newspaper in Bedoen mentioned this point in its editorial, saying, "If the entire Vietnam is occupied by the Japanese army within a few days, then the Japanese air force will gather from Saigon to Tokyo, from the east coast to the Thai border. As a result, communications in Hong Kong, Manila, and Singapore will be lost. Japan has requested Thailand to join the 'East Asia New Order Group' and promised to return Laos and parts of Cambodia in Vietnam to Thailand. The Operations Department said that on July 20 and 21, 20 transport ships left Guangzhou and headed southwest, and said that Japanese troops have concentrated in Taiwan and Hainan Island and have not yet headed north, or are threatening Thailand. Reuters, Bangkok, 27th – British Foreign Secretary Eden's remarks on the British-Thai non-aggression treaty have made a good impression here. All newspapers have emphasized Thailand's neutrality and its determination to defend itself against aggression. One newspaper said that the Vietnam incident has caused us some concern, but Thailand is different from Vietnam and has the strength to defend the country against foreign aggression. Japan's goal is obviously the Dutch East Indies, so it will not attack Vietnam in Thailand, because the Singapore base is defensive in nature and not used for offensive purposes. The only method that Britain can apply to Japan is to stop the supply of oil. Japan cannot do without oil, so Japan may fight for oil.

### Japanese Ships' Whereabouts in the Pacific; Daring Not to Approach the US Coast

Reuters, San Francisco, 27th – As a result of the US implementation of the freezing of assets, the Japanese luxury mail ship Tatota Maru was still stalled on the ocean last night. The ship carried more than a hundred American passengers and others.

### US Sends Important Personnel to the Far East to Handle Military Supplies Transportation

United Press, Washington, 27th – Commerce Secretary Jones declared yesterday that former Assistant Secretary of State and Undersecretary of Commerce Grady has been appointed as a special representative to the Philippines, Dutch East Indies, China, Burma, and the Federated Malay States to handle the production and transportation of military and important goods. The director of the Loan Office is Commerce Secretary Jones concurrently. Grady will also represent the Metals Reserve Company, the Rubber Reserve Company, and the National Defense Supplies Company. These companies are all federal agencies, and it is expected that Grady will soon depart for the Far East.

Editorial

### New Stage of Crisis in the Far East

After Japan's occupation of southern Vietnam and the retaliatory actions taken by Britain and the United States against Japan, the entire Far East has reached the eve of a major war.

If the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island in the spring was the "September 18th Incident" of the Pacific, then the Japanese occupation of the Tokyo area of Vietnam last September should be the "August 13th Incident" of the South China Sea; because the impact of the Japanese army's invasion of Vietnam on the South China Sea and the South Pacific is no different from that of the previous North China Incident or the Songhu Incident on the whole of China, and the reason why it has been able to maintain a semblance of peace until now is partly because Japan's strength is insufficient and it cannot extricate itself from the stalemated Chinese battlefield, and partly because other related countries are constrained by problems such as the European war and can only closely monitor it with gradual steps. According to President Roosevelt's remarks on the two-year history of oil sales to Japan on the 25th, it can be seen that the United States has paid considerable effort and price to prevent the South Pacific from being affected by the war. Unfortunately, the period of waiting for Japan to reflect has passed, and the expectation that the moderate faction in Japan will stop its external adventurism has also proved to be hopeless. The Matsuoka diplomacy has failed, and what has followed is an even more unscrupulous expansion policy. As a result, the innocent French Vietnam has suffered a third threat and has even forced a smile to offer up all of Vietnam's sea and air strongholds, serving as a scapegoat for the failure of the Matsuoka diplomacy! Although Cam Ranh Bay is not of great value as a naval base for the time being, and Saigon is still more than 500 miles away from Singapore, the Malay Peninsula, or the Dutch East Indies by air, Japan has taken a step further south into the South China Sea, approaching the back of the Malay Peninsula and occupying a strategic advantage that can be both advanced and defended; the center of the South China Sea route has also been seized, and maritime communications between Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, and Surabaya can be cut off at any time. This situation has clearly exceeded the maximum tolerance of Britain, the United States, and even the Dutch East Indies.

The US government's order to freeze the funds of Japan and the occupied areas of China, although timed just before the weekend, has caused tremors in all parties that have not been seen for more than a year. What should be confirmed here is that the great significance of this move in the economic aspect and the great difference in the interests of China and Japan have been expounded in yesterday's editorial of this newspaper, but in the political aspect, it actually indicates the arrival of a new stage in the Far East situation. The attitude of the US authorities in recent days has clearly indicated that, apart from the use of concrete and effective means, they will no longer continue to attempt to avoid war in the South Pacific by means of preferential treatment. The specific measures for this decision to freeze Japanese funds are still one step behind those previously applied to Germany and Italy, and there is still room for flexibility under the licensing system promulgated, but it can be asserted that this is absolutely impossible to prompt those who are determined to invade to reflect or repent. Therefore, the small amount of room or gap reserved will be blocked in an instant. Now Japan has also frozen US funds in retaliation, but because the economic relationship between the US and Japan is the dependence of the latter on the former, the damage caused to the US by this retaliation is insignificant compared to what Japan has suffered. Recalling that two years ago, when the US announced the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation on the same day, Japan was extremely frightened and eagerly sought the understanding of the United States in the hope of continuing the treaty, which is very different from its immediate retaliation at this time. This shows the general tone of the current Japanese cabinet's foreign policy, and its military fascist characteristics are even more credible. After Japan seized southern Vietnam, British Malaya felt the most threatened. As a result, Britain's attitude towards Japan has become more determined in recent days. The freezing of funds to Japan is not limited to the British headquarters, but is also implemented by various colonies, and preparations are being made to abolish various British-Japanese and Indian-Burmese-Japanese merchants. The blow to Japan's economic structure may be greater than the US embargo and freezing of funds. The policy of appeasement in the Far East has been completely uprooted. The future Far East issue will simply be a problem of strength comparison.

The current Japanese cabinet's use of Toyota as its foreign minister may have been initially intended to avoid revealing the trend of its foreign policy, so as to facilitate the implementation of the multifaceted resolutions of the Imperial Conference. However, the result of this occupation of southern Vietnam can no longer conceal its true face. The composition of the current cabinet is indeed a joint regime of militarists and chaebols, but the chaebols supporting the current cabinet are not peaceful industrialists but military industrial companies that have long been unable to obtain important raw materials from the United States. The freezing of funds in the United States only has an indirect impact on them. The most affected foreign traders and various light industrialists do not have the power to influence the current regime. This explains why the Japanese government quickly retaliated against Britain and the United States. This is by no means fearless, but it is the nature of military fascism. Even if the timing and environment are not favorable, they can only find a way out from radical and adventurous actions. After Japan retaliated against Britain and the United States, Britain and the United States will not stop as a result. Their recent movements indicate that even more advanced measures are being prepared for implementation. Even if it takes a considerable amount of time to evolve, this kind of promotion will inevitably lead to qualitative changes, and the South Pacific War will eventually be inevitable.

Although Japan's ultimate goal is to take risks and succeed, when it began to coerce French Vietnam, it was only advancing opportunistically in anticipation of a more favorable opportunity, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union or the Nazis launching another attack on Britain; on the other hand, this is precisely an opportunity for the civil nations to thoroughly resolve the Far East. With the East Line war in Europe at a stalemate, Japan has no way to obtain Axis assistance, but Britain and the United States may temporarily concentrate their forces to deal with the Far East. If there is close cooperation between China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies, this situation can be clarified easily. Once the wings of the Axis powers are broken, then solving the overall situation in Europe will be much easier.

### US and Britain Freeze Japanese Funds; Preliminary Measures to Sanction Aggression; US Obtains Flexible Control Over Trade; Will Inflict Serious Blow to Japanese Economy

United Press, London, 27th – After President Roosevelt announced the freezing of Japanese assets in the United States, Britain immediately followed suit and adopted the same measures. This surprised observers in London, as the communiqués issued by Washington and London were almost identical. Political circles believed yesterday that the freezing was only a preliminary measure to deal with the current situation. This move would be sufficient to completely halt Japanese industry in the shortest possible time. Observers were initially surprised that President Roosevelt also froze Chinese funds. After explaining that this move was nothing more than preventing the Japanese from using Chinese legal tender to obtain foreign exchange, they suddenly understood. It is believed here that the US freezing of Japanese funds will inflict a greater blow on Japan than the same measures taken by Britain, because as a natural result of the war and Japan's Axis alliances, all Japanese banking businesses in Britain have greatly reduced their pre-war business. In general, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands supply Japan with 86% of its war materials, of which the United States accounts for 56%, Britain accounts for 10.69%, and the Netherlands, including the Dutch East Indies, only accounts for 8.62%. Britain's cut-off of Japanese imports will alone lose Japan 50% of its revenue. The morning newspapers here today all published in large characters that the joint action of Britain and the United States will replace the fighting on the Soviet-German front. Although this news is relatively slow, all newspapers have commented on it. The Daily Telegraph stated, "The Japanese warlords have already made Japan deeply mired in the war against China and cannot extricate itself. Now they are attempting to find a solution by infringing on the interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East. The two major countries have always dealt with it with silent ability, but it seems that under the instigation of the Nazis, the Japanese soldiers ignored everything and exposed our establishment of base roots on Singapore Island and the actions of the US fleet in the Western Pacific. Economically speaking, the joint action of Britain and the United States is enough to kill Japan." The News Article reported, "This kind of action by Japan has made Japan a country cursed by all countries in the world. Although Japan has tried its best to adopt a policy of self-sufficiency, it still has to rely on other countries for most of its war materials. Now these sources will be cut off, and the policy of appeasement has stopped."

United Press, Washington, 27th – Deputy Secretary of State Welles told the press yesterday that President Roosevelt's order to freeze Japanese funds in the United States allows the US government to have overall and flexible control over all Japanese imports and exports and other economic and commercial activities in the United States. When asked whether this statement meant a complete embargo on trade between the US and Japan, he declined to answer. He also declined to elaborate on Japan's retaliatory freezing, because he had not yet received any official information. A secretary of Japanese envoy Nomura said that the Japanese embassy was not prepared to make an official statement on the US freezing action. He did not say whether a statement would be issued later.

United Press, Washington, 27th – Acting Secretary of the Treasury Foley declared that the freezing order was actually equivalent to a "trade freeze" between the US and Japan, but he did not admit that it constituted a ban, but he said that each transaction should obtain the approval of the Treasury Department. He also said that in the past few days, Japanese funds in US banks have had a considerable amount of withdrawals. Foley said that one of the reasons for freezing Chinese funds was to prevent Chinese funds from flowing into the United States and other places outside China, and to give the Chinese government greater control over the funds of its people. Foley said that the Japanese occupation of Chinese territory was also a factor. He pointed out that the National Government of China and the Central Bank have full control over whether there are any restrictions on their funds under the general auspices. He continued that the outflow of Chinese funds was "especially intense in the past few days, obviously anticipating this freezing action." At the same time, the Treasury Department issued other instructions to the China Defense Supplies Company (the agent for "Lend-Lease Act" transactions here), the Universal Trading Corporation, and the New York branch of the Bank of China.

### British Empire Affiliates Freeze Japanese Funds

Reuters, London, 27th - London sources state that the freezing of Japanese funds by the British and American governments should not be considered a joint action but rather an immediate parallel action. The effectiveness of this measure can be seen from the fact that in 1938, Japanese imports of American goods accounted for 34.4% and British goods accounted for 2.02%. The British freezing order affects all areas within the sterling zone.

Reuters, Singapore, 27th - The Straits Settlements government's order to freeze Chinese and Japanese funds prohibits the payment or transfer of cash or securities to Chinese and Japanese groups or residents. However, banks are allowed to respect obligations prior to July 26th and fulfill notifications received on that date. The term "Japan" in the prohibition includes Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Sakhalin Island, the Kwantung Leased Territory, and the Pacific Islands under Japanese mandate.

Reuters, Singapore, 27th - After the announcement of the British Empire's freezing of Japanese assets, Japanese residents in Malaya are in a state of panic. It is rumored that many Japanese have already purchased tickets and plan to return home on a Japanese mail ship that is about to arrive. Since June or July of last year, Japanese residents in Malaya have been successively sending their wives and children back to Japan. Regarding the freezing of Japanese assets, the most affected in Malaya is the export of iron sand, with annual shipments to Japan reaching two million tons. All iron mines are owned by Japanese companies.

Hong Kong, 27th - The Hong Kong government issued an order last night to seal off Japanese funds. Yano, the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong, sacrificed his Sunday holiday to go to the consulate to await instructions from Tokyo. The Hong Kong government is adopting the same policy as the British Empire. Funds in Hong Kong belonging to Korea, Taiwan, Sakhalin (Kuye Island), the Kwantung Leased Territory, the Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific, and Manchukuo are all included in the sealing order. The Japanese Consul Yano declined to comment on this matter, only stating that Hong Kong has various restrictions on import and export trade, and Japan has implemented exchange controls, so the amount of Japanese funds in Hong Kong is not large.

United Press, Melbourne, 27th - Australian Prime Minister Menzies announced yesterday that Japanese capital in Australia has already been frozen some time ago through exchange controls. Trade with Japan has been declared to be implemented on a prior authorization or yuan basis. As for merchants who violate the order after the freezing order is announced, the government has not yet issued new regulations.

United Press, Bombay, 27th - The government announced yesterday, based on orders from London, that it would freeze Japanese funds. However, no orders have been issued to the shipping companies to date. Currently, one Japanese ship is docked in Bombay, and it is said that four more are on the way. There are three Japanese banks and thirty-three Japanese factories in Bombay.

### US-UK Stern Action Welcomed by Chongqing

Reuters, Washington, 27th - The general opinion here is that every act of Japanese aggression will be followed by economic and financial countermeasures from the United States. For example, Japan's seizure of the Shanghai International Settlement would immediately trigger US countermeasures, but according to news received here, this is unlikely to happen. All parties express approval for the measures taken to deal with Japan's invasion of Vietnam, and many people are satisfied with Britain's adoption of the same actions. Most observers believe that the parallel actions of Britain and the United States, which could have curbed Japanese aggression ten years ago, have finally become a reality and will continue to move towards the same goal. Scripps-Howard newspapers have the following discussion: "Americans now call China and Britain friends. Japan is currently at war with China and is allied with Germany and Italy, who are at war with Britain. Japan's war materials mostly come from the United States. We should immediately stop it." This shows that the appeasement of Japan has been effectively eliminated, and a new policy based on determination is now being implemented and will move forward regardless of the consequences provoked by Japan.

Reuters, Chongqing, 27th - The government, press, and public are all satisfied with the freezing of Japanese and Chinese assets, calling it a serious warning to Japan. The second step will be war. A government spokesman expressed satisfaction with the US government's swift and stern measures to deal with Japan's actions in Vietnam. It is said that the degree of satisfaction is particularly high because these measures by the US government have received unanimous support. It is hoped that the ban on all oil shipments to Japan will also be implemented immediately. In addition, the British government, with the support of Canada, India, and South Africa, has taken the same actions at the same speed, indicating close cooperation between Britain and the United States to deal with aggression, which is another source of satisfaction for us. Well-informed sources here all believe that war will not immediately follow, and they are convinced that Japan will currently try to avoid war and hope to temporarily slow down after occupying southern Vietnam, waiting for the situation to ease slightly before taking the second step.

### Nationwide Silk Stock Freeze Ordered

International News Service, Washington, 27th

Due to the breakdown of US-Japanese economic relations and the fear of a shortage of national defense materials, the Production Management Bureau has ordered the freezing of raw silk and silk products.

### Japanese Troops Begin to Invade Vietnamese Base Areas, Military Delegation Members Arrive in Saigon

United Press, Saigon, 27th - Several Japanese military transport vehicles from Hanoi rumbled through the streets of Saigon today, a precursor to the Japanese occupation of southern Vietnam. The Japanese occupation is expected to reach its peak on Tuesday. Major General Sumida, leader of the Japanese military delegation, declared that he had reached an agreement with Vietnamese Governor General Decoux tonight to immediately implement the agreement concluded between Tokyo and Vichy in Vietnam. However, the general situation in the city remains calm. Movie theaters and restaurants are crowded. About a hundred members of the Japanese military delegation are filling the Continental Hotel, all dressed in uniforms. Outside the hotel, curious French, Vietnamese, and Chinese people are gathering to watch the Japanese officers. After arriving here today, the Japanese officers immediately began a large-scale shopping spree. They all seem to be photographers, as all the good cameras in the photo shops have been bought up by them. Flights of the Dutch airline KLM, which operate between Saigon, Singapore, and Batavia, have been suspended today, further isolating Vietnam from the outside world. Lieutenant Colonel Chudob, leader of the naval group of the Japanese delegation, told United Press: "The naval and land forces coming to southern Vietnam are the most disciplined. It is expected that there will be no accidents with the Chinese and French. If the Chinese here are willing to cooperate, we do not want to treat them harshly and will help them when possible." When asked why the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the Cholon district was occupied as the headquarters of the Japanese army, he replied that the Japanese army needed a large building, and the occupation of the Chinese building was in accordance with the Franco-Japanese agreement. When asked who would resolve the matter if an accident occurred between the Chinese or French and the Japanese army, he said that all such incidents would be judged by the Japanese delegation. When asked if the Japanese side was worried that accidents would occur, he replied that there was very little possibility of accidents, because the Japanese troops coming to Saigon would cooperate with the French to resist aggression. He denied that the Japanese army would force merchants to use Japanese yen. He said, "According to the agreement signed between Japan and France, the Japanese army's salaries will be paid in Vietnamese currency."

### Japan's Anti-Freezing Order Scheduled to Take Effect Today, Issues Regulations Restricting Foreign Trade, Privy Council to Meet to Discuss the Situation

Reuters, Tokyo, 27th - The retaliatory order issued by the Japanese government to freeze American funds is scheduled to take effect on Monday. However, Americans who use it to pay the salaries of their Japanese employees and pay taxes, and those used for purposes prescribed by the Ministry of Finance, are not restricted. The Privy Council is scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss the situation. Political circles believe that in addition to the developments in Vietnam and the freezing of funds, there are four other orders supplementing the General Mobilization Law that will also be considered. Last night, officials acknowledged that President Roosevelt's order to freeze Japanese funds in the United States was directly prompted by the Japanese-French Vietnam Joint Defense Agreement. The Ministry of Finance has issued regulations to be implemented tomorrow to restrict various transactions of foreigners and foreign merchants in Japan. The implementation methods of these regulations for designated countries will be announced shortly.

Reuters, New York, 27th - The Japanese Consul General in New York said yesterday that he believed that the US freezing of Japanese assets was due to many misunderstandings on the part of the US. It should be noted that Japan is indeed stationing troops in Vietnam in a peaceful manner.

Blockade Will Suffocate Japan in Less Than a Year

United Press, Washington, 27th - Senior government officials predicted today that if the Western democracies continue to tighten their economic blockade of the Japanese Empire, Japan's economy will be suffocated within a year. A government authority responsible for Far Eastern affairs declared that Japan's economic organization cannot withstand the severance of business relations with the British, American, and Dutch colonial empires for a long time. A senior official predicted the economic collapse of Japan, saying, "If the freezing orders of the democracies that tighten the economic blockade can be maintained for a considerable period of time, that is, a year or slightly more than a year, then Japan will inevitably suffer economic suffocation. Japan's business and its supply of major industrial raw materials have become accustomed to relying on vast overseas markets." Japanese ships have hesitated to enter American ports in the past three days, which shows that Japan had foreseen the US move. The "Tatsuta Maru" has now postponed its arrival in San Francisco, and it is said that many other ships have also been delayed. Well-informed sources predict that Japan's huge silk industry will be practically destroyed, so that a quarter of the Japanese population currently engaged in silk production will suffer huge difficulties. Textile factories will also be severely hit by the restricted supply from the United States and India. Officials said that for this reason and its vast market for its trade, Japan feels the pain of severing business relations with democracies more than its Axis partners. Officials expect Peru and Brazil to follow the US and Britain, at least restricting their exports to Japan. Both countries have fixed quotas for cotton exports to Japan. Officials estimate that Japan's oil reserves are sufficient for one year or slightly more than one year.

### German Military Momentum Wanes: No Significant Progress on Any Front; Soviets Defeat Two Nazi Infantry Divisions at Labor, Occupy Danube Delta Island

Moscow, July 27th, TASS - The Soviet Information Bureau announced in its July 26th night war report that fierce fighting continued in the Pokovnive, Versmolensk, and Dzhitomir areas, with no changes in the front lines. During operations in the Smolensk area, our forces defeated two enemy infantry divisions. Our air force, in coordination with ground troops, inflicted severe blows on enemy mechanized units, infantry units, and air force units. On the 25th, 98 German aircraft were shot down, while we lost 28. On the morning of the 26th, some German aircraft approached Moscow but were scattered and driven back by our fighter planes, with three enemy aircraft shot down.

Moscow, July 27th, International News Agency - The Red Army High Command announced this morning that Soviet forces had annihilated three German divisions yesterday and captured a strategically important island in the Danube Delta. The island was previously considered impregnable, but after a surprise assault by Soviet vehicles, it was captured in three hours. The Soviet communique stated that the German garrison fought fiercely but was ultimately completely routed by the Red Army naval landing force. The Red Army also seized a large number of heavy artillery parts, machine guns, and countless military supplies. The name of the island is unknown, but it is known that the name contains the letter "K". The communique continued that another two German infantry divisions were defeated by Soviet forces. Stockholm, July 27th, Havas - Regarding the German-Soviet war, here is a summary of the war situation on each front: (1) On the northern front, Finnish forces continue to advance on the eastern and western sides of Lake Ladoga, having recaptured the city of Salmi on the northeastern shore of the lake. However, progress towards the city of Petrozavodsk is proving difficult. After completely recapturing the area north of Lake Ladoga, the Finnish forces have been able to deploy two divisions to conduct mop-up operations in an area 45 kilometers long. However, with five Soviet divisions present, and the area laced with mines and reinforced concrete obstacles, the Finnish forces must fight hard to make progress. Currently, the five Soviet divisions are gradually retreating. (2) On the central Smolensk front, the Red Army has launched repeated counterattacks, and its encircled units have also repeatedly attempted to break out, but without success. German armored vehicle columns have reached the Vyazma area, 200 kilometers from Moscow. The Red Army is counterattacking in the Polotno and Kaluga areas, and the fighting is extremely fierce.

Moscow, July 27th, TASS - The leader of a certain tank battalion, Yevremyev, received a report from a patrol that a German company would attack our certain defense area the following morning. He immediately informed the commander of that defense area of this news and ambushed tank soldiers near the area. In the morning, an enemy tank company did indeed attack the defense area. The defending forces fought bravely, and in one and a half hours, the enemy lost eight tanks. The fascists, disregarding the lives of their soldiers and the use of ammunition, launched a fierce attack on the defense area with tank vehicles, and some scattered tanks even entered the vicinity. Yevremyev attacked the enemy from both sides, and ultimately scattered and routed the enemy tank force. At sunset, the defense area was surrounded by 38 German tanks, and 18 tank drivers were captured.

London, July 27th, Reuters - On Saturday and Sunday evenings, Moscow experienced its fifth major air raid. The German communique stated that German aircraft attacked transportation hubs and public utilities with great success. The Soviet communique stated that of the hundred or so German aircraft that attacked, only five to seven penetrated the anti-aircraft defenses, and no military targets were hit, with only a few civilian casualties. The air raid alert was issued at 11:50 last night and was not lifted until 3:30 this morning. Two German reconnaissance aircraft, one Junkers 88 and one Heinkel, were shot down by the latest Soviet fighter planes. Soviet officials invited foreign visitors to inspect the wreckage of the German aircraft. According to a Moscow announcement, from July 20th to 26th, Leningrad was subjected to twelve air raids, but all were ineffective. 41 German aircraft were lost, while 8 Soviet aircraft were lost.

### Ukrainian Guerrilla Warfare: Rising Up to Attack German Forces

Moscow, July 27th, TASS - The secretary of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Socialist Party, writing in Pravda, stated that there are countless guerrilla units operating behind enemy lines, and their numbers are still increasing. The cruelty and looting of the German fascists have filled every righteous person with intense hatred. After seizing a certain village, the enemy searched for collective farmers, but finding none, they captured the wives and children of the collective farmers and buried them alive. In Berezno, because several German soldiers were killed, 200 villagers were massacred by the fascists. Fascist bandits loot the property of farmers everywhere, rape women, and burn down the food stores of farms. Most of the collective farmers have joined the guerrilla forces, seeking to avenge the cruel acts of the fascists. The fascists had prepared a large number of "receipts" in advance, planning to loot the people on a large scale when they attacked the Soviet Union. However, the Ukrainian people absolutely refuse to supply food. They would rather burn their fields than allow them to be taken by the enemy. Therefore, German radio loudly proclaims, "Farmers, what are you doing? Why are you burning your crops?" Ukrainian farmers, gripping their pistols, respond to these cries. In one instance, a German tank broke into a certain village in Zhitomir Oblast. Most of the farmers had already fled. As the German tank column drove down the empty road, suddenly an old white-haired farmer rushed out of a house, shouting, "Death to the fascists!" and threw a hand grenade at the lead tank. News of the victories of the guerrilla forces behind German lines arrives daily. One small guerrilla unit was forced by the fascists to transport ammunition for them. Other guerrillas discovered the situation and immediately placed obstacles covered with steel spikes on the road they had to travel. These ammunition vehicles were immediately stopped. Reports from various areas indicate frequent incidents of enemy vehicles derailing and bridges being blown up. The leader of a certain Ukrainian guerrilla unit is known as "Grandfather". Under his leadership, the guerrillas have destroyed seven German tanks, a group of enemy motorized units, and several long-distance telegraph and telephone lines. Another guerrilla leader is a former secretary of a certain Socialist Party local committee. His unit recently destroyed several enemy vehicles loaded with ammunition and fuel. Guerrilla forces are welcomed everywhere, and the people are happy to help. The enthusiastic support of the people has spurred the guerrillas to fight even more bravely.

### British Press Assesses German Offensive in Soviet Union: Difficulties Increase Daily

London, July 27th, United Press - The Nazi offensive against the Soviet Union reached the end of its fifth week last night. Five weeks of fighting have made the Nazis feel that the distance between their troops and Moscow is much greater than the distance between their troops and Paris when they launched their attack on the Low Countries (Netherlands and Belgium) fifteen months ago. The first wave of Nazi blitzkrieg attacks has been slowed by Soviet resistance, leading to a second, more intense offensive. Today, the Nazis realize that if they want to crush Soviet resistance, they must greatly increase their forces and launch a third major offensive on these three fronts. Regardless of the significant losses the Germans may inflict on the Soviet Union, the Germans have been unable to penetrate the strong defenses of Kyiv or Leningrad. On these two fronts, the Germans have not made any significant progress. On the central front, the initial German advance averaged 25 miles per day, but now, averaging over the entire war, it is only 12 miles per day. This pace is no faster than Napoleon's advance from Vilnius to Smolensk, and Moscow is still a long way off. It goes without saying that the Soviet Union has suffered significant losses in manpower and materials, but we have learned from various signs that the Germans have also been forced to pay the same enormous price as the Soviets. According to the most reliable information, the Soviet forces, except for some setbacks in the first few days, have since conducted orderly retreats each time, and their morale is very high. The effectiveness of the Soviet defenses is clearly due to the following two facts: (1) If there is a possibility of improving the long-distance defense lines behind the Soviet forces, the Red Army would rather allow the Germans to advance as far as they want. (2) The Soviet Union has an enormous counterattack capability, which none of Germany's other enemies have possessed. British commentators believe that Soviet counterattacks, such as the one that began south of Smolensk on Thursday, are very important in thwarting the Nazi offensive. Related to this major counterattack is the Soviet Union's ability to maintain its air force active in the front line area and to prevent the Germans from gaining control of the air, making it impossible for them to easily achieve air superiority as they did in previous campaigns. A military reporter for the Standard Evening News stated that if the Germans had indeed destroyed the effective strength of the Soviet air force, they would have been able to bomb Leningrad, Moscow, and other cities in broad daylight, just as they had previously bombed Rotterdam and Belgrade. The fact that German aircraft are bombing Moscow at night is due to the fear that daytime bombing would result in too many casualties. This proves that the combat power of the Soviet forces is still strong and effective. Starting today, in four more days, the war in Soviet territory will have lasted as long as the period from the German invasion of the Low Countries on May 10th last year to the French request for an armistice on July 17th. Most people here believe that unless Hitler can quickly conquer the Soviet Union, not only will the invasion of England become impossible due to inclement weather, but the problem of the eastern front will also become complicated. Based on this view, some commentators even doubt whether Hitler, if he conquers the Soviet Union before mid-September, will be prepared to deal with another situation elsewhere. The "elsewhere" is likely to be Turkey. Although the Turkish army is poorly equipped and difficult to cope with the overwhelming German army, it is foreseeable that the Turks will put up fierce resistance. At that time, the Turkish army may be backed by the British forces in Syria and Iran, and the British Air Force will also join in cooperation. In addition, the roads in Turkey are very long and the transportation is not good. However, in addition to Turkey, there are also the Soviet Union's Caucasus oil fields and various very advanced industries, which would be rich spoils of war for Germany. If the Soviet Union loses the Caucasus oil fields, it would be the most serious loss for the Soviet Union and an important gain for Germany, while Turkey could be used by Germany as a base for a winter offensive against the Suez Canal.

### Rumors from Sweden: German Troops Reach Leningrad

Stockholm, July 27th, Havas - Special correspondents of Havas World Telegraph Agency report from the capitals of the Scandinavian Peninsula that rumors circulated this morning that German troops had reached the outskirts of Leningrad and were fighting the Red Army there. Swedish military officials could not confirm this claim. It is also rumored that German armored vehicle units, after breaking through the city of Novgorod (southeast of Leningrad), advanced southeast and crossed the railway between Moscow and Leningrad, and continued eastward to the railway connecting Leningrad to Vologda (east of Leningrad). There is no official information to confirm this information either. It has been confirmed that German bomber groups have bombed and cut the railway line connecting Leningrad to Morshansk near Bologoye (between Leningrad and Moscow). Currently, German aircraft groups are still continuing to bomb Leningrad. According to Soviet sources, no military targets have been hit, but civilian houses and newspaper offices have been heavily damaged. The Winter Palace of the Imperial era has also been damaged, but the collections of famous artists stored in Leningrad have been moved to safe places. In general, Leningrad's air defense equipment is much inferior to that of Moscow.

### Leader of Soviet Military Delegation Meets with U.S. Authorities: U.S. Plans to Supply the Soviet Union with Military Supplies Under the Lend-Lease Act

### Stalin and Churchill Exchange Letters

London, July 27th, United Press - According to yesterday's report, British Prime Minister Churchill and Stalin exchanged letters.

He also praised the success of the British Royal Air Force, saying that Germany will one day be heavily bombed by the British Air Force. Churchill also expressed his admiration for the Soviet Union's resistance to the German invasion. Churchill also mentioned British aid to the Soviet Union, saying that the nature and extent of British aid to the Soviet Union depends entirely on the extent of U.S. aid to Britain.

### Axis Aircraft and Submarines Vigorously Attack Malta: British Garrison Inflicts Heavy Damage; Many Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

London, July 27th, United Press - On Friday, Axis submarines, escorted by warships, vigorously attacked Malta. Since the start of the war, this kind of attack is still the first time. Yesterday, neutral parties believed that the purpose of the Axis attack was the British battleships or other cruisers and destroyers in the port, because these warships had been heavily damaged by the Axis on Thursday while protecting the fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. Although the British Admiralty communique did not acknowledge that one of the warships had been heavily damaged, it did not reveal which British battleship had been stationed in Valletta. (A special communique from the Italian High Command stated that on Friday night, the Axis Navy attacked the British naval base in Malta harbor with great success, and was able to enter Malta harbor despite intense British artillery fire.) British Secretary of the Navy Alexander stated that the British fleet on Thursday was carrying supplies to replenish the losses of the past several battles and to establish new forces to attack Libya or defend the Axis attack on Turkey, Iraq, and Syria. At the same time, the Admiralty communique stated that when the Axis Air Force attacked the British fleet, it shot down 12 Axis aircraft and heavily damaged 4. The communique also acknowledged that the U.S. lost a destroyer, the Intrepid, and a merchant ship, but claimed that it passed through the center of the Mediterranean Sea during the operation without loss. The Axis warships never dared to participate in this battle. British Secretary of the Navy Alexander stated that the ability of the British fleet to safely pass through the Mediterranean Sea demonstrates the strengthening of the British Navy in the Middle East. The Admiralty also released the situation when the Mediterranean fleet was attacked, stating that on July 21st, the British fleet was spotted by Axis reconnaissance aircraft. That night, an Axis submarine came, but was sunk by the British fleet's strong defense. In the early morning, the Axis aircraft came to bomb for the first time, including the largest torpedo bomber, but two were shot down by British anti-aircraft fire. At this time, the British destroyer Intrepid was hit by a torpedo and gradually sank. In the afternoon, enemy aircraft attacked again and two were shot down by British warplanes, and some enemy aircraft were heavily damaged. At dusk, although enemy aircraft attacked three times, there were no losses. At that time, the fleet had approached the surface of the Axis base and finally crossed the enemy's air force sight with excellent navigation skills, as the Axis aircraft used a large number of flares to inspect the fleet's tracks. On the 25th, the invading fleet was attacked by enemy submarines again. One merchant ship in the fleet was hit and damaged, but it was still able to continue sailing with its power. One of the enemy submarines was also sunk by the British. After that, the enemy came to bomb with dive bombers, and two were shot down by British anti-aircraft guns. The British also lost three naval aircraft. At the same time, one British cruiser was also damaged. Other merchant ship losses were very small. The Axis Air Force was ultimately unable to heavily damage the fleet. In the total number of air battles, at least twelve enemy aircraft were shot down, and many were heavily damaged.

### More Than Twenty German Divisions Concentrated on Turkish-Bulgarian Border: German Invasion of Turkey Only a Matter of Time; Bulgaria Drawn Into Vortex, War Will Expand

Istanbul, July 27th, TASS - The continued concentration of German and Bulgarian troops on the Turkish-Bulgarian border has caused extreme anxiety here. According to the information obtained, the German and Bulgarian troops concentrated there reach 23 to 25 divisions. In addition, a large number of Bulgarian troops are concentrated in other areas, especially Plovdiv and Svilengrad, in order to quickly reach the Turkish border. People arriving here from Bulgaria say that Bulgaria is in a state of war. Trains full of reservists pass through Sofia every day, and the mobilized population reaches more than 40,000. Roads and airports are being expanded, and railways are also being expanded. Temporary bridges have been built over the rivers on the Turkish border. At the same time, the Bulgarian side is strengthening its military and naval bases in the Black Sea. Newspapers in Istanbul report that the German troops stationed in Africa, under the command of Rommel, have almost all been transferred to southern Bulgaria. Rommel himself has not yet arrived in Bulgaria. It is said that he had a long conversation with Hitler a few days ago.

### European War Miscellany (7) (10) Record of Submarine Warfare

The cook managing the periscope's lifting and lowering mechanism had nothing to do, as the submarine was far below periscope depth. In their deep, dark surroundings, the temperature never rose much above freezing. The interior of the submarine was cold and damp, no different from a tomb. Everyone had put on all their clothes, but woolen coats and thick socks were still not enough to maintain body temperature. That Qiu Fu lay on the floor next to the lifting and lowering machine, his eyes fixed on the clock face, shivering with cold. He and the soldier next to him made several small bets on when the next depth charge would explode violently, to pass the time. He wanted to know how long they had been submerged. The air had become heavy and turbid, and he felt dizzy, but the hunter had gone off course and left. The explosions were also weakening. Although they might still turn back, as things stood, it wasn't too bad, except his nose seemed about to bleed. Some didn't pay any attention to the depth charges at all, or pretended not to care. Some crawled into bed and snored loudly, while others read books. He pretended not to care either, but in reality, he was very concerned, extremely concerned. He had nothing to do, which made him very annoyed, but they had to wait patiently until they suddenly rose to periscope depth.

Boom! A depth charge came! But it was very far away, and the submarine only shook slightly. The one next to him, managing the namesake oil tank floating pestle, said: "That's ten cents. Let's see, I've got one shilling and four cents. You have nine cents, this is—wait a minute, my head is spinning, it's hard to count, eight, no, you owe me seven cents..."

The torpedo lieutenant shouted: "Don't talk so much, save your breath for breathing!"

A metallic clanging sound seemed to come from afar. It turned out that the engineer was repairing a crack. One of them suddenly dropped the wrench on the floor.

The Colonel tiptoed into the workroom from the stern and said: "Don't let him make any noise. The hydrophone could easily hear just now."

A lieutenant engineer's face appeared in a gap in the floor and said: "I know, I know, I'm very sorry—but in this environment, you try repairing a crack! We are soaked to the bone, and some people's abdomens are already cramping. Their hands are too cold to grip the wrench."

"Just wait another half an hour and it will be dark. Then we can rise to the surface and have something hot to eat. Is the crack very bad?"

"Not so bad that it can't be repaired."

His head suddenly disappeared below the floor, like a Jack-in-the-box from a toy box.

The Lieutenant stood where his shadow could be reflected in a shiny piece of metal. He didn't realize he was in the mirror. He glanced casually and saw a strange face covered in whiskers reflected on the metal surface. For a moment, he didn't know who this person was. He stared intently before realizing it was himself. He felt a strange sense of pleasure, as if these moving whiskers were the result of some extraordinary quality of his own. Then he understood that it was a gift of time, all thanks to these extremely slow days—there could be no other explanation.

Today was the last day of this patrol. In five minutes, they would have to call the captain. If it was dark, they could surface and then sail back to their country. Once at the base, he could shave off his beard like everyone else and be praised. He had to wait and see how people reacted. So many girls!

"One, number—just one second—" The second officer, the torpedo lieutenant, looked through the periscope. "Just take a look," he left the periscope, yielding to the side. "Is it right in the path of the moon?"

The naval captain caressed the rubber pad, as focused as a hound dog sniffing for prey, without moving his body. He gently moved the handle and suddenly shouted: "Stop the motor! Call the captain! Everyone to your positions!"

At this time, the naval lieutenant was lying in the cabin with his clothes on. He dreamed of an orchard. His wife stood on a ladder picking apples, handing them to him one by one. His arms were already full. One apple was not placed straight and was about to fall, but his eyes were only focused on the sunlight shining on her curled hair, revealing itself from between the leaves, brilliant like gold, so he couldn't bear to look away.

She shouted: "Don't let it roll down, it will break."

He replied loudly: "I can't hold any more. My thumb is already injured."

The alarm rang, and he immediately woke up, dangling his feet, which still wore boots, off the bed. He saw the torpedo lieutenant standing in the doorway. "An enemy submarine is right in the path of the moon, it's very easy to hit," he said, then turned and left.

As usual, the captain focused his eyes on the periscope during the attack, not speaking except to issue urgent orders. But at this time, he suddenly became a talkative person. "Wonderful, this is a big submarine... it's stopped moving... five degrees to port... hold steady forward."

The tired crew, stimulated by this, felt electrified. The submarine was immediately filled with tension. The shooter sat holding the lever, his eyes fixed on the disc from under his thick eyebrows. The other torpedo men looked at each other and smiled, rubbing their hands together, but their faces were expressionless, making them inscrutable.

A gunner happily said: "Right in the path of the moon." He bent down and looked at the hatch of the ammunition depot, where Tao Dehan was sitting stroking a shell. "Did you hear that, Dehan; there's an enemy submarine stopped in the moonlight, the captain has aimed at it."

The hull of the boat shook, as if the entire structure was being stimulated. They could hear the captain's voice, extremely excited, shouting orders backward. Someone behind him happily shouted: "We hit it!" A heavy hand patted him on the back. "We hit it, kid, we hit it!"

At this time, the bow was tilted upward. Lieutenant Commander hurriedly ran to the command tower, climbing up the vertical ladder. There was no time to release the accumulated air pressure from the vent. Looking at the pressure gauge, he knew that if he opened the hatch, the air pressure could blast him straight out. He ordered the signalman behind him: "Hold me tight." The man listened and hugged the captain's knees with all his strength. The captain opened the hatch, the air rushed out, flipping the binoculars he was wearing right over his head.

He gasped and said: "Okay." The signalman released his hands, and he crawled out into the sunlight. The night was silent, and the wind blew into his nostrils, carrying a smell of oil. He shouted down, giving directions and speed, ordering them to sail upwind.

The driver walked to where they were standing and shouted "Hey!" They smelled it together. The captain asked: "Can you smell it?"

"Of course, I can smell it. Look!" He pointed to the waves, the crests reflecting the moonlight, like silver. There was a patch of black oil in front, obscuring the light. They circled around this thing, searching for the wrecked ship through the telescope.

The captain said: "From what I can see, it's a mine-laying vessel. I think we blew up its mines. What a terrible explosion. I don't think we need to waste any more time here, let's go." (The End)

### Freezing Foreign Exchange Deposits Will Not Affect Legitimate Chinese Businesses, Legal Foreign Exchange in Shanghai Will Continue to Be Supplied, Specific Freezing Measures to Be Announced Today

Since the US President announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds, and the British government took similar action, Japanese-owned banks and industries in China have been greatly affected. Trade with Britain and the United States has almost come to a standstill, while the status of Chinese foreign exchange and legal tender has become more stable and consolidated. Speculation and arbitrage in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market will be eliminated as a result. However, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has fully cooperated with fourteen friendly banks to continue to supply as much foreign exchange as possible to legitimate Chinese, British, and American businesses. The Shanghai exchange market will be stable for a long time to come. Therefore, we sincerely hope that all sectors will not be misled by rumors, so as not to cause self-inflicted turmoil.

Specific Measures to Be Announced Today: British and American banks in Shanghai, such as HSBC, Chartered Bank, Citibank, Chase Bank, etc., have decided to suspend all foreign exchange deposits of Chinese and Japanese banks and businesses, freezing them. Specific measures will be announced today (Monday). It is said that the method of paying in London and New York drafts will be adopted, that is, foreign exchange depositors will only be allowed to remit to the above two places. As for the idea of converting and paying in legal tender, it is not credible because of practical difficulties. However, legal tender depositors can still withdraw freely and are not subject to any restrictions. New legal tender accounts can also be opened as usual. Therefore, the foreign exchange stored by Japanese businesses in British and American banks will be frozen, and the foreign exchange of Chinese foreign exchange speculators will also be unable to be withdrawn.

Fourteen Banks Jointly Maintain: In order to protect the interests of legitimate Chinese, British, and American businesses, British and American banks in Shanghai, (1) five American banks: Citibank, Chase, AIA, American Express, and Trans-Pacific; (2) six British banks: HSBC, Chartered, Mercantile, Old Sassoon, New Sassoon, and British Bank; (3) two Dutch banks: Dutch East Indies and Netherlands Indies; (4) Moscow Narodny Bank of the Soviet Union, a total of fourteen banks, have obtained special notes from the US government. These banks and the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will work together to stabilize exchange rates for business and import/export trade matters within China. If various industries have legitimate needs, they can apply to the banks to purchase foreign exchange in accordance with the law.

Speculation and Arbitrage Will Be Eliminated: The American member of the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, Mr. Hinkes, has returned to Chongqing after inspecting the finances of Shanghai and the occupied areas. In addition to recommending to the US government to freeze Chinese and Japanese funds, he will continue to maintain the Shanghai exchange rate in accordance with the established policy of the Chinese government, but will make every effort to eliminate speculative activities and arbitrage by conspirators. Now that Chinese and Japanese funds have been frozen, speculators and conspirators in the Shanghai foreign exchange market will no longer be able to use their old tricks. Therefore, freezing Chinese funds is actually freezing funds in Shanghai and the occupied areas. As for the funds in the free areas, the Chinese government has already controlled them.

Legitimate Needs Will Be Supplied as Much as Possible: Various industries in the Chinese free areas, such as purchasing essential goods for import into China, can apply for Chinese-listed commercial foreign exchange in accordance with the law. The legal foreign exchange rate (US$30, £1 2s 6d) remains unchanged, and the commercial exchange rate (US$7.50, £4 6d) remains the same. As for the Shanghai black market, due to environmental reasons, the Chinese government's power cannot reach it, so it cannot be controlled. However, in order to take care of legitimate businesses, authorization is given to friendly banks to maintain it secretly. It is said that the import of essential goods into Shanghai will follow the past method of weekly applications and approvals by the Central Bank, and foreign exchange will be supplied as much as possible, but not publicly, and will be handled secretly by the fourteen friendly banks.

Foreign Exchange Business of Chinese Banks: According to responsible persons from the four banks of China, Communications, Agriculture, and various commercial banks, regarding the issue of British and American freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds, they are unwilling to express their views because they have not received orders from the Chinese government. However, it is expected that there will be accommodation for the foreign exchange stored in British and American banks for legitimate purposes. The foreign exchange business of the banks will not be suspended in the future, because the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has promised to continue to supply the foreign exchange needed by legitimate Chinese businesses, and the banks will follow the orders of the government. It is also said that the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank will announce the legal foreign exchange rate as usual every day at 10:00 am, starting on Monday, without any changes.

Market Conditions Will Tend to Stabilize: The Shanghai foreign exchange, gold, securities, yarn, cotton, and miscellaneous grains markets fluctuated slightly last Saturday because the truth about the British and American freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds was unclear. According to the New Voice News Agency's inquiries from various industries, this fluctuation is only temporary and is expected to calm down and become stable after the market opens today. Moreover, the fluctuations in the Shanghai market are not related to the entire Chinese financial system, because the wartime financial system has already laid the foundation. Moreover, freezing Chinese funds was requested by the Chinese government, which is beneficial and harmless to legitimate Chinese businesses, and can avoid the danger of black market fluctuations in the future. Therefore, legitimate merchants from China, Britain, and the United States have unanimously expressed their support for this.

### Shooting Bloodbath Near Xitu Mountain Bay in Western Shanghai Last Night, Another Japanese Sentry Shot and Seriously Wounded, Border Between French Concession and Chinese Territory Blockaded and Extensively Searched

At 9:15 last night, near Xitu Mountain Bay in western Shanghai, a Japanese sentry was patrolling the area when he was suddenly shot at by a man. The Japanese soldier was caught off guard and hit by several bullets, seriously wounded, and fell into a pool of blood. The shooter, seeing that his goal had been achieved, escaped into the darkness. Afterwards, the Japanese side sent the wounded Japanese soldier to the hospital for treatment. The soldier's life and death were difficult to ascertain. The Japanese side blockaded the bottom of Avenue Petain and Route Haig, which border the French Concession and Chinese Territory near Xujiahui and Xitu Mountain Bay. A large number of Japanese soldiers searched house to house. The situation was quite serious for a time. It is said that two suspects were arrested and taken to the Japanese military police headquarters for questioning.

One Japanese Sentry Dies From Serious Wounds: The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that at nearly 10:00 pm on the 26th, a Japanese naval sentry on the Rue Erkowsky, near Kunming Road in the Hongkou District, was chasing a suspect when he was shot in the abdomen by another thug. The murderer escaped, and the Japanese sentry was rushed to the hospital for treatment. It was reported that he died of his wounds on the morning of the 27th. After the incident, the Japanese side implemented extremely strict security measures on the north side of the Suzhou Creek, arresting several people suspected of being the murderers, and dispatched Japanese soldiers to station at various intersections for extensive searches, causing innocent pedestrians, regardless of nationality or gender, to be blocked in the rain for several hours, and one by one was subjected to inspection, countless in number. Foreign pedestrians had to show their passports, and Chinese pedestrians had to show their passes, before they could pass. Moreover, they were inspected every time they passed an intersection, which was unspeakably miserable. All the bridges on the Suzhou Creek were closed, and traffic was cut off, until noon today when they were opened. The Japanese sentries have all been withdrawn from the streets of Hongkou and the Yangtzepoo District, and vehicles and pedestrians are allowed to move freely.

The bridges on the Suzhou Creek were opened once at 0:10 am yesterday, but suddenly re-closed at 7:06 am. They were opened and closed from time to time thereafter, until around 12:00 noon, when they were reopened, and traffic was restored.

Residents of Nanshi Fled One After Another

Yesterday, it was widely rumored in Nanshi that the Japanese and French Concession authorities would continuously close the iron gates for two months starting next month. It is said that this was to prevent the anniversaries of the "August 13th" and "September 18th" incidents, so ordinary residents were preparing to move to avoid inconvenience. However, the Dagang News Agency reporter inquired from the French authorities, and the result was that this news could not be confirmed. However, there have been many cases of residents moving out of the iron gates yesterday.

Rumor That Iron Net in Zhabei Will Soon Be Opened: Recently, it has been widely rumored that the Japanese, due to some reason, will completely withdraw the Japanese Marine Corps stationed there when necessary, and all defense work will be handed over to the Ning side. At that time, the iron nets along the Concession will be opened in consultation with the Concession authorities. However, it is currently still under negotiation, but our confirmation is still pending.

### Jinghu Freight Train Was Blown Up Again Yesterday, Between Longtan and Xiashu, Many Locomotives and Freight Cars Destroyed

Yesterday morning, the first freight train from Ning to Shanghai, with thirty or forty cars, all loaded with cattle, chickens, ducks, various sacks, boxes, etc., was traveling between Qixia Mountain, Chaodong, Longtan, and Xiashu when it suddenly encountered a mine explosion, making a loud noise. Many locomotives and freight cars were destroyed, and the losses were quite heavy.

### Japanese Warships Intercepted Sailing Boats Outside Wusongkou

It has been found that the sailing boats were traveling back and forth carrying commercial goods, so the reason for the detention this time is unknown.

### French-Owned Water and Electricity and Vehicles Will Increase in Price Again Next Month, Approved by the French Municipal Council, Lowest Price of Trolley Tickets Same as British

The French-owned water and electricity company in the French Concession previously submitted a request to the French Municipal Council for approval to increase the price of water and electricity and French Concession trolleybuses and buses. The temporary committee of the Municipal Council held a meeting on the 25th of this month and decided to approve it, effective from the 1st of next month. The details of the water and electricity price increase are as follows: (1) Electricity: 56 cents per kilowatt-hour. For the first 399 kilowatt-hours of electricity used per month, the discount for exceeding this amount will be calculated in accordance with Article 14 of the user contract regulations. (2) Electricity (configured power below 10 horsepower): 36 cents per kilowatt-hour. For the first 300 hours of monthly use, 35 cents per kilowatt-hour for exceeding that amount. (3) Electricity (configured power equal to or exceeding 10 horsepower): 35 cents per kilowatt-hour. For the first 300 hours of monthly use, 34 cents per kilowatt-hour for exceeding that amount. (4) Electric heating: 34 cents per kilowatt-hour. (5) Tap water for ordinary users: 32 cents per cubic meter. (6) Tap water for special users: 32 cents per cubic meter, increasing to 64 cents per cubic meter for exceeding the maximum amount. As for French trolleybuses, trackless trolleys, and buses, the price will also increase from August 1st. The newly revised ticket prices will also be posted on each vehicle at the same time. It is reported that the lowest price of tickets will be increased to the same standard as British trolleybuses and buses, with the minimum fare being 10 cents for third class and 15 cents for first class (French bus fares are calculated according to first-class trolley prices).

### Various Circles Elaborate Different Viewpoints on Economic Retaliation Taken by Britain and the United States

The English-language "Times" believes that the freezing order (1) Its purpose, is to place the Chinese exchange market under the management of Chongqing and Washington, so as to stabilize the status of legal tender. (2) Although the funds of China and Japan are frozen at the same time, the real target is Japan. (3) Adopt effective methods to eliminate Japanese arbitrage. (4) It will be extremely difficult for Japan to trade with the United States in the future. Although China will have to adopt a licensing system to use funds in the future, the difficulties will be very small. (5) Although Japan has long felt that democratic countries will take economic retaliation that is unfavorable to Japan, it does not believe that it will be so rapid. As a result, Japan has only exchanged 10 million US dollars in US dollars in Shanghai recently. (6) China's funds in the United States are worth 400 million yuan. It is reasonable to place them under the joint management of the two countries in the future to avoid being destroyed by the Japanese.

The "North China Daily News" recorded: (1) Firmly believes that this move by the United States will never harm China's interests. (2) The freezing of Chinese funds at the same time is entirely due to the wide range of China's occupied areas, which makes it easy for a large amount of foreign exchange to fall into the hands of the Japanese. (3) A licensing system will be implemented for China's needs, so that Chinese national banks can still use funds in the United States to purchase American goods. (4) The Shanghai black market has been controlled, and speculative activities are expected to be reduced. (5) In the past, 18.83 legal tender could be exchanged for one US dollar, but now 19.28 is required. However, this is a temporary phenomenon. Once the demand for legal tender increases sharply, it will undoubtedly rise.

The Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" recorded: After this move, although there are many opinions, it is possible to be optimistic about the future of Shanghai. It is said that the Japanese side had long anticipated that the US President would freeze Japanese funds in the United States, so the Yokohama Specie Bank has thrown out tens of millions of US dollars in US dollars in the past few weeks. Now that the storm between the US and Japan is tightening, the legal tender will rise. In terms of Shanghai's foreign trade, it will become more active. For example, Germany is at war with all of Europe, but it has not invaded Switzerland. Therefore, after Germany's funds in the United States were frozen and trade between the two sides stopped, the trade between Britain and the United States and other countries had to take Switzerland as the hub for communication. It is expected that after Japan stops direct trade with the anti-Axis countries in the future, Shanghai has become a free trade port, and it has also become a medium for foreign trade in Shanghai, importing considerable materials from the United States and Britain in legal tender. Since the relationship between legal tender and Britain and the United States is so close, it will undoubtedly rise. Then, in the future, Japan's foreign trade will only be concentrated in Shanghai, and Shanghai will become more prosperous.

The English-language "Greater Shanghai Weekly" commented on the US freezing of Japanese funds yesterday, saying that the US freezing of Japanese funds is tantamount to hitting Japan over the head. Japan has been making profits step by step over the years, driven by two things: one is that Japan is too "lucky," and the other is that the United States is too patient. Now Japan's luck has come to an end, and the United States' patience has also stopped. Now, in addition to freezing Japanese funds, the United States has also taken various other steps to deal with Japan. This is the first time in four years that the United States has taken the offensive in the Far East. However, Japan cannot retaliate by freezing US funds in Japan, because US funds in Japan have been frozen for several years. Except for obtaining special permission from the Japanese side, American businessmen in Japan have long been unable to escape their funds to Japan. Today, even if the government also issues an order to freeze US funds in Japan, what is the benefit?

The Japanese-language "Continental News" also published a commentary yesterday, the content of which was aggressive and weak, claiming that: Due to the establishment of the Vietnam joint defense agreement between Japan and France, the British and American plan to encircle Japan has been shattered. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the United States has always regarded Japan's actions in China as aggression. This compromise between France and Japan is also regarded by the United States as an act of Japanese aggression. This view is really abnormal, because Japan has stated that it respects the territory and sovereignty of Vietnam. This action by Britain and the United States has little impact on Japan. However, from the perspective of the two countries being in a truly opposed attitude with Japan, it is no longer effective to use extraordinary diplomatic means. Therefore, Japan should recognize the situation in the future, and should quickly seek the final liquidation of the economic system that depends on Britain and the United States, so as not to make their threats and intimidation effective.

### US Naval, Army, and Air Force Attaches Hold Meeting in Hong Kong, New Embassy Attache Arrives in Hong Kong and Transfers to Chongqing, Official Secrets Strictly Guarded Regarding the Content of the Meeting

Hong Kong Special Correspondence: Many US naval, army, and air force attaches in China have arrived in Hong Kong one after another, given the increasingly serious situation in the Far East and in order to find ways to deal with it. They include US Embassy Counselor Lieutenant Colonel William Meyer, Major McHugh, Naval Counselor Thomas, and the newly appointed Embassy Air Force Attache Lieutenant Colonel Corosen Dorff, etc. According to the report, Mr. Gao arrived in Hong Kong by Clipper a few days ago and plans to stay in Hong Kong for a short time before going to the capital to take office. They held an important meeting at the US Consulate in Hong Kong yesterday to discuss various military issues in China in detail, and are expected to maintain contact with all parties and exchange opinions during their stay in Hong Kong. However, official secrets are still being kept regarding the content of the meeting.

### National Rice Abundant and Imminent: Merchants Negotiating Purchases, Agreed Prices Reportedly Very Low, Future of Rice Market Can Be Sustainably Stable

Rice-producing areas in the country, such as Kunshan, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Changshu, Jiaxing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Tongli, Songjiang, etc., were previously subjected to control, resulting in the inability to transport large quantities of rice of all qualities from these areas to Shanghai. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from various merchants that rice planting in the aforementioned areas began in early June of the lunar calendar and has now been fully completed. Due to consistent rainfall, the rice paddies are lush and promising. Harvesting can begin at the end of July or early August of the lunar calendar, at which time rice will be continuously transported to Shanghai for the market. Farmers have already been in contact with various merchants to sell their rice, and the agreed prices are reportedly very low. As for early rice in the suburbs of this city, harvesting has already begun in some areas, but the quantity is small and not transported here in large quantities.

Affordable Foreign Rice Purchases to Continue

In addition to cooperating with the French Concession authorities to adopt both fundamental and superficial measures to streamline the sources of domestic and foreign rice and crack down on various illegal transactions in the rice market, the Public Concession's Bureau of Public Works also directly contacted the Hong Kong government to purchase large quantities of special small-grain Burmese rice from Rangoon, which was shipped to Shanghai in batches and distributed to rice shops for resale to the public. This initiative, implemented since May 17th of this year, has achieved remarkable results and greatly benefited ordinary citizens. It is understood that, in order to uphold its original intention of continuing to suppress domestic and foreign rice prices, the Bureau of Public Works remains steadfast in its efforts to purchase affordable foreign rice and is determined to continue doing so, shipping it to Shanghai regularly for sale at low prices. It is reported that the amount of affordable rice already shipped to Shanghai but not yet sold is considerable.

Ample Rice Reserves Ensure No Shortage of Staple Food: Regarding the city's overall staple food reserves, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association sends personnel weekly to conduct on-site investigations of rice and grain warehouses in Pudong, Hongkou, and the central district, providing information for the authorities of both concessions and the seven rice industry groups to review. The results of the investigation are published externally on a regular basis. Currently, the city's staple food reserves have reached their most abundant level, and there is no fear of a shortage of staple food. According to insiders in the rice market, in recent months, the sales of rice in stores have been unusually sluggish, as citizens are waiting for rice prices to continue to fall. Therefore, the overall staple food panic in the city has become a thing of the past, and citizens' concerns can be completely dispelled. It is understood that, except for a small number of poor people, middle and upper-class citizens have stored large quantities of rice.

No Fear of Interruption of Foreign Rice Supply: After the news of US President Roosevelt's announcement of freezing Chinese and Japanese funds in the United States spread in the rice market yesterday, unscrupulous rice merchants, seeing an opportunity to exploit, made unfounded claims, causing people's anxiety to return. Major players resumed their old tricks of hoarding goods, citing the impending interruption of the foreign rice supply, which led to a rise in the prices of domestic and foreign rice. However, this price increase by unscrupulous rice merchants is completely unjustified and is the result of rumors spread by speculators. It is understood that the government authorities will continue to provide as much foreign exchange as possible for legitimate needs in various industries. Since rice is a necessity, foreign exchange will definitely be obtained, and there is no fear of an interruption in the foreign rice supply. It is hoped that citizens will not listen to baseless rumors, and the future of the rice market can be sustainably stable.

### Manager of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, Wu Zengyu, Arrested Yesterday: His Son, Wu Zhongyi, Also Arrested by the Japanese

The British-owned Shenxin No. 9 Factory is a giant among Shanghai's cotton mills. Not long ago, there was an attempt to take it over, which was later denied in a newspaper announcement. People generally believed that since the factory was entirely operated by foreigners, the matter would be resolved peacefully. Unexpectedly, yesterday at approximately 1:45 AM, the factory's manager, Wu Zengyu, and his son, Wu Zhongyi, who was the workshop supervisor, were suddenly arrested by the Japanese. This was truly beyond everyone's expectations. Wu Zengyu, a native of Wuxi, is over sixty years old and resides at 170 Panxin Road in the French Concession. Yesterday at 1:15 AM, during curfew, four plainclothes officers from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, accompanied by detectives from the Lujiiawan Central Police Station of the French Concession, suddenly knocked on the door and entered the house while the family was sound asleep. Wu Zengyu and his son were awakened by the unexpected visitors and, not knowing what was happening, put on their clothes and got up. They were taken to the French Police Station, where their names, ages, native places, addresses, and occupations were recorded. They were then extradited to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Hongkou. The reason for their arrest was not explained by the Japanese.

### Rumors of Closure of Department Store Dance Halls

It is rumored that the dance halls attached to the Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun department stores in the Public Concession are about to close. The reason given is that there is opposition to department stores running this type of business. However, the reliability of this claim is uncertain. As for the New World's Great World Dance Hall, it has already closed, and its original location will be converted into a shopping mall.

### 1.5 Million Yuan Kidnapping Case: Kidnappers All File Appeals, Expressing Dissatisfaction with the First Instance Verdict

### Luo Lili's Suicide for Love

(Special Report from Our Newspaper) Yesterday, our newspaper published a news item about the tragedy of international love, a Guangdong girl's suicide for love. To obtain more accurate information, we sent a reporter to investigate. The details are compiled as follows:

Luo Lili's Home

Luo Lili, a Guangdong girl, was 19 years old, had a beautiful appearance, and was fluent in English. Her family lived in Jikang Lane, west of the small vegetable market on Xinzha Road. They rented a room on the third floor. The furnishings were simple, with only a bed, table, and chairs. When the reporter arrived, he saw four or five men and women speaking Cantonese in the room. All of them looked somber. After the reporter explained his purpose, an old woman who identified herself as Mrs. Luo, 65 years old, Lili's mother, stood up first, extended a warm welcome, and described the tragic events.

Years of Hardship

According to her, her late husband had been a vendor and passed away more than ten years ago. She only had three daughters. The eldest, Runhua, was already married. The second was Lili, now 19 years old. The youngest daughter was Yuehua, 17 years old, who was pointed out as one of the women present. The family used to rent a house in Sande Lane on Haining Road. They moved to this place after the war. For more than ten years, they have lived a life of hardship and extreme poverty. In February of this year, Lili was introduced by a friend and started working as a hostess at the Carde Hotel at 7 Carde Road. She brought home only 60 or 70 yuan in salary each month to help support the family. For several months, everything was peaceful.

A Companion Reports a Suicide at an Inn: Starting on the 23rd of this month, Lili did not return home for two consecutive nights. The family became suspicious. They thought that she had always been well-behaved and kept to herself. Her sudden disappearance was inexplicable. Her mother had wanted to go to the hotel to inquire, but she never got the chance to see her. On the afternoon of the 25th, her companion, Lu Bei, came to the house and said that Lili had taken poison at an inn and was on the verge of death. They rushed to the Weida Hotel and learned that she had been taken to the Tirentang Hospital for treatment. She was immediately transferred to the hospital, but it was too late to save her.

No Knowledge of a Love Affair with a Sailor

Later, the reporter asked if there was any truth to the fact that Lili had met an American sailor, that they had developed a close and inseparable love affair, and that Lili had committed suicide after the sailor fell in love with someone else and sent a letter to break up with her. Mrs. Luo replied that her daughter Lili had worked at the Carde Hotel for almost half a year. She had never visited her. Recently, because she had not returned home for two days, she had gone to the hotel five times to look for her. As for her daughter's actions outside of the hotel, she had no prior knowledge of them.

Visiting the Carde Hotel

After leaving the house, the reporter went to the Carde Hotel at 7 Carde Road. The accountant, Ms. Lu, welcomed him. She said that Lili had been working there as a hostess for four or five months. Because of her beautiful appearance, lively and adorable personality, and childlike temperament, the male guests enjoyed her company. Her business exceeded that of her peers, and her income was very high. She was favored by the boss.

American Sailors Often Came to Visit: However, five Chinese and three Western female companions were jealous of her success and called her "thirteen points." They said that Lili did have an American sailor, whose name they did not know, with whom she had a very close relationship. He often came to visit her and held her arm in front of the bar. They even took a picture together as a souvenir. Unfortunately, the sailor was unfaithful and abandoned Lili. Before the incident, he sent a letter to Lili, saying that he was breaking up with her. After receiving the letter, she was heartbroken and tore a portrait to shreds to vent her anger. Afterward, she revealed her intention to commit suicide to her companions Mimi and Lu Bei.

Weeping Uncontrollably on the Phone: According to Lu Bei, Luo had stayed at her house on the evening of the 23rd of this month. After getting up the next morning, she went straight to her sister's house and stayed there all day. She did not know where she spent the night. On the evening of the next day (the 25th) at around 7:00 PM, she called Mimi. Because she had not yet arrived at the store, Lena answered the phone. She heard her crying uncontrollably on the other end of the line. Everyone predicted that she would commit suicide. Lena comforted her in gentle words, hoping that she would change her mind. Later, she asked where she was calling from so that they could meet. She said that she would provide the address around 10:00 PM.

Rushing to the Hotel and Finding that She Had Taken Poison: Around 10:00 PM, the boss answered a phone call. The caller identified herself as Lili and asked him to tell her family to come to the hotel to collect her body the next morning. Mr. Zhu knew that she had taken poison. He tried to find out where she was staying, but the call was disconnected. He contacted the telephone company to inquire about the origin of the call. He learned that it came from the Weida Hotel at 993 Xiafei Road. He rushed there and learned that she was in room 10 on the second floor. When they opened the door, they saw that her face was pale and she was vomiting. She was rushed to the Tirentang Hospital for treatment, but she had taken too much poison and could not be saved. She died at midnight. The boss paid for all the coffin and funeral expenses, which exceeded one thousand yuan.

Loitering on the Balcony

Later, the reporter went to the Weida Hotel. According to reports, Lili had checked into the room at around 4:00 PM and paid 25 yuan for the room. She was wearing a pink cheongsam and white suede shoes. According to the waiter, Luo had come once before and left the next morning, looking happy. However, this time, she looked depressed and unwell. She loitered on the balcony, pacing back and forth, sometimes leaning on the railing and looking down as if she was about to jump. The staff suspected that she had a mental illness and paid close attention to her. They did not expect her to commit suicide by taking poison. (Xiao Zhi)

### Theft of Canned Food in American Barracks: Unopened Cans Thrown into Garbage Heap, Retrieved After the Truck Leaves and Sold for Profit

Shen Zande, a native of Nanjing, was the head of catering in the American barracks near the intersection of Xinzha Road and West Mill Road. He hired Jiangbei workers Zhu Xueli, Zhou Licheng, etc., who were responsible for cleaning. Recently, the barracks authorities discovered a large increase in food expenses, especially for canned food. They secretly investigated and found that Shen Zande and his accomplices were stealing. Their method was quite clever. Every morning, after the barracks had been cleaned once, Zhu and Zhou would cart out the garbage and empty cans. Shen took advantage of this opportunity to conspire with them to throw unopened cans of food into the garbage heap, so that Zhu and Zhou could retrieve them after the truck left, sell them, and split the profits. Over time, the amount became considerable. It was not until the other day that they were discovered by the authorities. The incident was reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent Detective Zhu Mengwei and Investigator Chen Shanji to arrest Shen Zande, Zhu Xueli, and Zhou Licheng. However, two other accomplices, Yangzi, Xiaosizi, and Xiaowuzi, were still at large. The previous morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Jiang Baolian described the case and requested a postponement. The court granted the request and ordered that the case be postponed pending the arrest of the other accomplices for further investigation.

### Two Bandit Leaders Arrested: Handgun and Bomb Seized

Wah Detective Shang Wu and Investigator Kong Guangxiao of the Putuo Road Police Station arrested two bandit leaders, Dong Rongqing and Huang Lianshan, both from Jiangbei, at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday in the Hengye Lane of Robert Sheng Road. They seized a handgun, five bullets, and a hand grenade found on the ground in the lane. They were taken to the police station together. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police Attorney Jiang Baolian described the case and stated that the suspects were planning to rob a household at 1033 Xiaoshaji Road. He requested a postponement. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be remanded and the case to be verified on another day.

The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that Shandong was clear and hot, with winds from all directions. The area between this location and Ma'anshan Island was changing from cloudy to overcast, with gentle easterly winds and localized fog. There was a cyclone in southeastern Japan and Kyushu, with severe weather. Due to the northeastward or north-northeastward movement of the storm, the center of the hurricane reached a point within 60 miles of 31 degrees north latitude and 131 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM. The wind was northerly or northeasterly, and the wind force was strong. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 84.9 degrees, and the lowest was 68.9 degrees.

### Ministry of Education Stipulates That National Secondary Schools Should Add Vocational Departments

(Chongqing News Agency) In view of the importance of social production, the Ministry of Education has specially added vocational departments to national secondary schools and has issued regulations for implementation. The regulations are as follows:

(1) All national secondary schools that have not established vocational departments or have few students in their vocational departments should plan to establish or enrich the contents of their vocational departments in accordance with these regulations.

(2) The establishment of vocational departments should be limited to those that do not require large amounts of special equipment and meet the needs of the local area or anti-Japanese construction.

(3) The training goal of vocational departments is to cultivate students with a skill that is sufficient to participate in social production work or independent business.

(4) The scope of vocational departments is temporarily set as follows:
    1. If there are production or national defense construction agencies near the school, it should establish this type of academic department in close contact with them to provide students with practical exercises and may hire technical personnel from the agency to serve as internship instructors.
    2. If there are no national defense construction agencies near the school, the establishment of the academic department may be decided based on considerations of agriculture, industry, commerce, production, and economics. Agricultural subjects include crops, breeding poultry and livestock, beekeeping, sericulture, winemaking, and planting vegetables, melons, and fruits. Industrial subjects, in addition to local major handicrafts, include simple metalwork, cotton weaving, bleaching, dyeing, and the manufacture of daily-use bamboo and wood utensils. Commercial subjects include bookkeeping, accounting, typing, and clerical work.

(5) In addition to students from war zones distributed and registered by the Ministry of Education, each school should also provide vocational guidance to students in the school. If students volunteer to study vocational subjects, they may be allowed to change academic departments, but only students in the first year of senior and junior high school are eligible.

(6) The vocational academic department's expenses should average 300 yuan per month for each senior and junior high school level. The equipment expenses will be determined according to the circumstances of the academic department.

(7) In addition to hiring personnel with considerable qualifications, each academic department should also hire skilled craftsmen from various industries to serve as work instructors.

(8) The internship equipment of each vocational academic department should be used as much as possible for the production and labor training of senior and junior high school students.

(9) Each school should prepare implementation measures in accordance with the above regulations and submit them to the Ministry for approval before the end of the semester.

### Students and Faculty Members Who Withdrew from Secondary Schools in Shanghai and the Ning-Shao Area to Register with the Zhejiang Department of Education

(Fangyan News) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education previously received an order from the Ministry of Education to prepare for the establishment of a temporary secondary school to accommodate faculty members and students who withdrew from secondary schools in Shanghai. While preparations were underway, war broke out in various counties in Ning-Shao in this province. Public and private secondary schools either temporarily closed due to tight education funding or were unable to maintain operations due to falling into the war zone. Faculty members and students lost their jobs and schools and were in urgent need of relief. After approval from the Ministry of Education, they were included in the accommodation of the temporary secondary school, which is scheduled to open in August. We are now formulating registration measures for faculty members and students who have withdrawn from secondary schools in Shanghai and the war zone counties of Ning-Shao in this province (the measures can be obtained from the department or by mail). Faculty members and students from each school may apply for registration with the department within the prescribed time limit in accordance with the regulations (faculty members and students from each school in Ning-Shao who can still contact the original school may apply for registration with the original school, which will report in accordance with the regulations) for review and allocation.

### Academic Lecture The Procedure of Reading

— Hu Deling

A general modern book at least includes three parts: first, the preface, editor's note, and explanatory notes, or only the preface without the editor's note and explanatory notes, or only the editor's note without the preface and explanatory notes; second, the table of contents or index; and third, the main text. Sometimes, in addition to the main text, there are also appendices.

No matter what book you get, assuming you are going to read it, then, (1) you should read the preface, editor's note, or explanatory notes. In general, people often do not pay much attention to this, but in fact, it is very important. Why? Because the preface probably explains the author's motivation for writing the book and the points he wants to pay attention to in the main text of the book. The editor's note or explanatory notes more specifically describe the main ideas and organization of the main text of the book. These are very helpful for understanding the entire book. Furthermore, if we have already read some books in the category to which this book belongs, we can know how much this book can help us from its preface, editor's note, or explanatory notes. Also, sometimes after reading the preface, editor's note, or explanatory notes, we can understand whether or not we should read the book immediately. If it is not necessary to read it immediately, we can save time to read other books first and then come back to read it when it is necessary for reference.

(2) Is to read the table of contents or index. Reading the table of contents or index, the organization and outline of the whole book will have a bit of a shadow in our minds. Reading the table of contents or index is the same as reading the preface, editor's note, or explanatory notes. If we have already read some books in the category to which this book belongs, we can also know how much this book can help us from it. If it is not necessary to read it immediately, we can also come back to read it when it is necessary for reference.

(3) Of course, reading the main text of the book. How should the main text be read? We can use our reading methods flexibly. If the book is really good, we have to read it carefully. If it is very ordinary, we may as well read it briefly. The appendices outside the main text are very related to the main text, so it is best to refer to them while reading the main text.

According to the research of general scholars, there are three principles that should be followed in the reading process, namely (A) from modern to ancient, (B) from general to specialized, and (C) from concrete to abstract. Here, they are explained separately below: (A) From modern to ancient Since we are people living in modern times, we should first read modern books. We do not necessarily have to seek the knowledge needed for modern times only in modern writings. However, modern books provide us with more practical knowledge than ancient books. Therefore, in terms of procedure, we should go from modern to ancient. (B) From general to specialized In terms of the reading process, we should go from general books to specialized books. For example, if you do not understand ordinary economics and go to read Marx's "Das Kapital" or Commons' "Legal Foundations of Capitalism", you will naturally not understand it.

Qian Gechuan said, "What we read should have an order and cannot be reversed. If you don't even understand modern English and go to read Shakespeare, you are sure to fail. After the success of the Russian Revolution, Marx suddenly became popular, so young people all held a copy of 'Das Kapital', which they certainly did not understand. ... If you don't even understand the basics of economics, how can you understand Marx? If you really want to read some economics books, the first thing you should not do is start by reading 'Das Kapital'."

(C) From concrete to abstract The arrangement of learning materials is generally from shallow to deep. When learning, we should first start from a direct view of concrete facts and then proceed to abstract thinking. Then, no matter what, we can understand it step by step. For example, when reading philosophy books, we should first read science; when reading social science books, we should first read natural science. This is to go from concrete to abstract. However, when we have read philosophy books and have a bit of a grasp of the laws of thinking, we can gain a further understanding by going back to read science.

### My Summer Hygiene

— Ding Fubao

The summer season is the most prone to illness, so the mortality rate increases. During this season, everyone should be careful and not careless. Eat less and chew slowly and swallow slowly. Do not eat any frozen drinks, all kinds of chicken, duck, beef, mutton, fish, meat, shrimp, crabs, etc., sliced ​​fruits and vegetables sold on the street, and suspicious foods. Flies, mosquitoes, fleas, etc. must be driven away and kept clean to prevent the spread of viruses. As for my personal lifestyle, I get up early in the morning, wash with cold water, drink a bowl of warm boiled water, eat an apple, and four tomatoes. After washing the tomatoes, soak them in boiling water for half an hour, peel off the skin, and then eat them. Then eat two eggs, also soaked in boiling water for half an hour. This is breakfast. I have lunch at half past noon, eat a bowl of porridge, half a pound of milk, a small half bowl of various vegetables, a small piece of butter on top, and a bowl of boiled water. At three o'clock I eat four more tomatoes and drink a bowl of boiled water. At seven o'clock for dinner, I eat a bowl of porridge, a small piece of high-quality butter, and a little bit of English vegetables. In addition to eating and drinking, I spend the whole day reading and working instead of exercising. I take deep breaths day and night; the windows of the bedroom are open all night, whether winter or summer, to replace air therapy. I permanently abstain from meat to prevent food poisoning, and I give myself two enemas every day to prevent fecal poisoning. I do not smoke, so my heart, brain, and various endocrine glands are not poisoned by nicotine, making it difficult for me to age. Therefore, I am old but my blood pressure is not high, my blood vessels have not hardened, my internal organs are free from disease, I am energetic, my complexion is ruddy, and I am stronger than meat eaters. I take a bath and go to bed at ten o'clock, and my abdomen should be covered warmly and not be cold. I am always optimistic. This body is not mine, let alone things outside the body. I laugh away all my worries. Therefore, I can fall asleep as soon as I get into bed, not knowing whether the butterfly has transformed into Zhuang Zhou or Zhuang Zhou has transformed into a butterfly. It is like this in the summer, and it is not always like this in the other three seasons. What a pity is that I am almost seventy years old, and I have failed to avoid mistakes. I am too extravagant, and I am ashamed and sweaty. I should repent bitterly in my heart and body, but I do not know if I can reduce the pollution in the luminous sea of ​​my mind.

### Prevention of Cholera Epidemics

— Zhaonian

True cholera has recently been discovered in this city, which is a serious warning to all residents. Cholera, called Cholera in English, is sometimes called Huleila or Huyi for short. It is the most terrible acute disease in summer. It can cause people to collapse and die within a few hours or ten hours. Therefore, when this disease is at its peak, everyone cannot help but turn pale at the mention of it.

The occurrence of this disease is caused by the transmission of cholera bacteria. The source of transmission is mostly from the mouth, such as drinking unclean raw water and undercooked dairy products, as well as eating unwashed raw fruits and vegetables. Flies are also a vector for transmitting this disease. One or two days before the onset of the disease, there may be symptoms such as intestinal colic, slight diarrhea, and headache. Sometimes there are no signs at all. What suddenly comes is severe diarrhea, incessant vomiting, thirst, white tongue, soreness in the legs, and even sunken eyeballs. The skin of the hands and feet is cyanotic and wrinkled, cold sweat is secreted, the temperature drops, the pulse is weak, there is urinary retention, etc. In severe cases, the abdomen and limbs twitch, various parts of the body are cold, and even death occurs. The entire process takes only two or three hours in the fast cases, and no more than twelve to twenty hours in the slower cases.

When this disease is epidemic, in order to prevent infection, we should strive for hygiene. (1) Never drink unboiled water and milk. (2) Do not eat cold dishes, cold noodles, cold cakes, and other foods from food stores. (3) Do not eat food on which flies have landed. (4) Do not eat unwashed or unpeeled, or already rotten fruits. (5) Do not eat unwashed and properly cooked vegetables, etc. We must be careful in terms of diet. In addition, vaccination and avoiding contact with cholera patients are also very related to personal safety.

If you are unfortunately infected with this disease and have symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, you should immediately go to the hospital. You must not take folk remedies or ask someone to scrape sha, so as to delay the disease and cause it to become incurable.

### Talking About Summer Fruits

— Shifan

Fruits have been human food since ancient times. In uncivilized times, they were used as the main food. From a nutritional point of view, it can be said that they have a great effect on people and can also treat diseases. Summer is the time when there are the most fruits, and we can all enjoy them as much as possible. Here are a few kinds of fruits for those who love fruits to refer to.

Watermelon: The origin of watermelon is very ancient. As early as 4,000 years ago, Egypt, India, Arabia, and other places used it as food. Ancient Greece and Rome also flourished in planting it. Later, it was introduced to China. Now, the Tiger Yellow watermelon produced in Sanlintang, Pudong, and the Sanbai watermelon produced in Pinghu are both very famous. Watermelon is a wonderful product for relieving summer heat. Eating it can relieve boredom and thirst and cleanse the stomach and intestines. Its ingredients are mostly water, and a small part is solid matter. The solid matter contains inorganic substances such as potassium, phosphorus, and lime. The reason why watermelon can cure kidney disease is that it contains a lot of potassium, which has a diuretic effect.

Peach: The Honey Peach is the most famous. Its ingredients are water and sugar. It contains a lot of sucrose and tartaric acid, so it tastes very sweet. According to the research of Swiss botanist Ladislaus Jamborcki, peach has the effect of treating rheumatic fever.

Apple: The origin of planting is quite ancient. Western Asia and Eastern Europe are its place of origin. There are Yantai apples, American apples, etc. Its ingredients are water, protein, acids, sugars, and inorganic substances. Among the inorganic substances, potassium is the most abundant. Among the acids, malic acid is the most abundant, followed by citric acid, and then tartaric acid. The sugars contain glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Apples have a special value for digestion. Apple powder has been used to treat dysentery and has achieved remarkable results.

Tomato: Although this thing is mostly used as a vegetable for cooking, it can also be eaten raw. It is native to South America and is highly valued in Europe and the United States. It can be eaten raw or used for cooking, and it can also be pickled in salt and vinegar. Its ingredients are water, protein, fat, sugar, and inorganic substances. This thing contains vitamins ABC and is a very nutritious food. It also contains fat-decomposing yeast, so it is very good for digestion when eaten with fatty meats. Recently, there have been many eaters. It seems that this food with great nutritional value should be promoted, which will be of great benefit to our bodies.

### Personal Prevention Methods for Typhoid Fever

— Qian Yuan

The best way to prevent typhoid fever is to have complete sanitary facilities, so that there is no virus in the surrounding area. For example, major cities in Europe and the United States have complete tap water, ditches, infectious disease hospitals, and disinfection stations. All aspects of disposing of garbage, eliminating flies, and regulating food and beverages are put into practice, and the number of typhoid fever patients has also been sharply reduced. The second is personal prevention methods, which from a negative point of view is to pay attention to diet, and from a positive point of view is to get preventive injections to increase resistance to this disease. These are described separately below: (1) Negative prevention: All food and beverages must be covered with gauze to prevent flies from touching them. Flies are a vector for viruses, which is known to the world, so efforts should be made to eliminate flies and prevent their occurrence. Rats are also carriers of viruses from time to time, so rats must also be prevented, and food must not be touched by them. Also, cockroaches and ants can also be carriers of transmission, so it is also advisable to be careful to prevent them.

Drinking water should be clean, and attention should also be paid to general-purpose water. Raw water should never be drunk. All fruits should be peeled before eating.

It is best to install screen windows in the kitchen to prevent flies from entering and exiting. The chopping board and the place where fish, meat, vegetables, and fruits are washed should be kept clean and dry at all times.

Although our country's sanitation facilities are not as good as those of other countries, the general public has the habit of not eating raw food. This alone has prevented many infectious diseases. Europeans and Americans eat raw oysters, and Japanese people eat raw fish. Every year, many people get typhoid fever because of this kind of appetite. However, although Chinese people do not have the habit of eating raw food, some people like to eat live shrimp, which is really not advisable and should be abandoned in summer.

(2) Positive prevention: In order to increase resistance to typhoid fever, preventive injections can be given. This type of injection can not only reduce the rate of transmission, but also reduce the mortality rate.

If you unfortunately suffer from typhoid fever, you should go to the hospital for treatment immediately. Because this intestinal disease focuses on diet in treatment, if you take medicine indiscriminately, are careless in your diet, or do not follow the expected treatment, it will often cause perforation and bleeding in the affected area, which is very dangerous.

### Food Hygiene in Summer

— Shen Bogan

Because of the rise in temperature in summer, it is easy to combine with the development of bacteria, so infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, bacillary dysentery, epidemic dysentery, and cholera are also prone to occur. However, the route of transmission is mostly food. If you can eat and drink cleanly, you can reduce countless opportunities for infection, and clean eating and drinking can improve the health of the stomach and intestines. Therefore, resistance to all external diseases can also be enhanced.

Food hygiene can be implemented by boiling the food for two minutes. That is, after the food boils, take it off after two minutes. By boiling for these two minutes, not only can all kinds of infectious bacteria be killed in summer, but also parasites cannot survive. Naturally, food is safe, and the nourishing substances such as vitamins are also less damaged, which is better than general cooking methods. This two-minute boiling method can be used for fish, eggs, vegetables, etc. It is fine to use it for eggs, and it is just half-cooked, and the taste is the most delicious. Use it for all vegetables. After boiling, take it off after two minutes, and put it together with the pot for a while, then the heat will be just right. All vegetables can retain their natural deliciousness and can be called the best cooking method.

Ordinary bacteria harmful to the human body will die once boiled, but if the food and beverages have been decomposed by bacteria too much, after boiling, although the bacteria can be killed, the chemical toxic substances that have been decomposed will still remain, and the toxins of the bacteria are also not easily destroyed by heat, so even if there are no living bacteria, eating it can still cause poisoning. Therefore, rotten things cannot be eaten even if they are boiled.

### Summer Hygiene Special Issue: Summer Personal Hygiene

— Ding Huikang

Every summer, unfortunately, terrible infectious diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever threaten our lives. These infectious diseases are transmitted through food and drink. Therefore, water is a major problem. At the same time, because these infectious pathogens exist in the excrement of patients, especially feces, and sometimes vomit, the disposal of excrement is also a serious problem. Flies, as vectors, also become a significant concern.

For the safety of the public during the summer, an active and permanent solution is naturally to fundamentally improve our environmental sanitation, ensuring that excrement is properly disposed of and disinfected to prevent the spread of germs and the breeding of flies. At the same time, drinking water must be inspected and disinfected. Although this fundamental solution must be implemented by public authorities, cultivating habits of cleanliness and hygiene can also be very helpful.

Before obtaining this permanent solution, a relatively active measure is personal prevention. This includes: (1) Being careful about diet, avoiding drinking raw water or cold drinks made with raw water, and avoiding eating raw water-soaked and cut-up fruits, or food that flies have landed on. (2) Developing hygienic habits, such as washing hands before meals. (3) Avoiding contact with sick people. (4) Getting vaccinated to increase resistance to the disease. If unfortunately infected, medical treatment should be sought as soon as possible, and self-diagnosis and indiscriminate use of medication should be avoided. Diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever are all intestinal diseases, and treatment and care must be taken very carefully. An error can delay treatment and lead to regret.

### On Vegetarian Diet in Summer

— Huang Zhaoping

Every summer, there is a custom of eating "Leiqi vegetarian food." Whether the motive is appropriate or not is another question, which I will not discuss here. However, from a health and economic perspective, eating vegetarian food in the summer is indeed beneficial.

Our fondness for meat is merely for the pleasure of the palate. From a nutritional and health standpoint, vegetables are far superior to meat. For example: vegetables contain various vitamins and minerals essential for human nutrition, which meat lacks, firstly. Meat contains toxins or waste products, while vegetables do not, secondly. Meat often contains parasites, worms, and other germs that can cause illness when consumed, while vegetables do not, thirdly. Vegetables are easier to digest, while meat is not, fourthly. Furthermore, meat rots easily in our intestines, producing toxins that can cause headaches, mental fatigue, and various neurological symptoms, while vegetables do not. Vegetables can keep the intestines clean and healthy, thereby reducing the occurrence of diseases. During the summer, when our stomach and intestines are weakest and most susceptible to disease, eliminating meat and improving the vegetarian diet is indeed very beneficial to health.

From an economic perspective, at a time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, although everything is expensive, the price of vegetables is still cheaper than meat. Practicing vegetarianism in the summer aligns with the principle of frugality. Therefore, eating vegetarian food in the summer, regardless of the motive, is beneficial and highly recommended.

Some say that a vegetarian diet becomes boring over time. This is not entirely true. Mr. Ding Zhonghu has been a vegetarian for nearly thirty years and has never changed his diet. This is enough to disprove the notion of boredom. Mr. Ding is nearly seventy years old, but his physique is strong, his spirit is vigorous, and he is no less robust than a young man. His arm strength is even greater than that of some young men. This is a clear and significant demonstration that decades of vegetarianism can lead to health and longevity. If we can follow Mr. Ding's example, we can be vegetarians all year round, not just in the summer.

### Suitable Paintings for Summer Residences

— Zheng Yimei

"Read books in winter and summer, and travel in spring and autumn," this is a wise saying from the sages. It shows that it is appropriate to stay at home in winter and summer. In the summer, the scorching sun fills the sky, and the Red Emperor commands. At this time, staying at home to cultivate tranquility, without crossing the Lei Pond for a single step; rolling up the curtains in the south wing, spreading out the bamboo mat by the north window, burning incense, and appreciating paintings, the elegant charm desires to flow. In my opinion, the most suitable paintings for summer are small pieces by Song and Yuan artists, such as the sparseness of Ju Ran, the simplicity of Huang Da Chi, the imposing vigor of Mei Hua Daoren, and the unrestrained elegance of Fang Wuyu. Facing them opens the heart and mind. A refreshing breeze seems to slowly emerge from the paper, silk, ink, and brush. Qian Zishou, having been away from the country for many years, returned after experiencing danger. His paintings took inspiration from the past, and recently he has been making great progress, steadily entering the hall of Song and Yuan artists. Sun Zixueni, Yang Ziqingpan, and Cheng have become famous at home and abroad for their mastery of the Six Principles of Painting. They skillfully adopt the standards of Song artists and infuse them with the spirit of Yuan artists. Their works are sparse, serene, and far removed from the dust of the world, washing away the common vulgar and coarse habits. To commemorate Shouti's return, a calligraphy and painting exhibition will be held at the Daxin Department Store's fourth floor from the 28th of this month to August 3rd, for seven days. There will be many exquisite small pieces. Obtaining just one piece and hanging it on the wall will be like cleansing the soul with an ice pot, completely dispelling the summer heat. Those who love art will surely be eager to see it first.

### How to Avoid Malaria

— Zijia

Every summer, the hateful malaria attacks humanity again. The source of malaria is a single-celled parasite (malarial parasite) that attacks red blood cells.

In the past, there was no way to cure this hateful malaria. Since the accidental discovery of cinchona bark in Peru in 1640, it has saved countless lives. Today, the drug extracted from cinchona bark—quinine—has become the world's recognized holy medicine for treating malaria. Although traditional Chinese medicines such as Changshan, Chaihu, and Binglang can also treat malaria, they are not as effective as quinine. Therefore, quinine still dominates as the standard malaria treatment drug.

Quinine can not only treat malaria but also prevent it. During malaria outbreaks, to avoid malaria, it is wise to prepare a sufficient amount of quinine and take it regularly, one tablet every other day. This drug enters the bloodstream and is the only way to prevent the growth of malarial parasites.

Among mosquitoes, there is a type called the malarial mosquito, which can suck blood from malaria patients and transmit the malarial parasites in the blood when sucking the blood of healthy people. Therefore, in the summer, when living in mosquito-prone areas, mosquito nets are essential to avoid being visited by malarial mosquitoes. This is also a point to pay attention to in preventing malaria. Lung Disease in Summer: Lung disease requires the most nutrition, because sufficient nutrition allows the body to be full of vitality, reducing the activity of tuberculosis bacteria and naturally leading to their elimination. During the hot summer, the gastrointestinal tract is the most susceptible to disease among the tissues of the human body. When the gastrointestinal tract becomes unhealthy, it is bound to be unable to receive rich nutrition, especially for those suffering from lung disease. Therefore, in the summer, the condition often worsens, even leading to accidents. Therefore, those suffering from lung disease who wish to survive the long and terrible summer should not only pay attention to recuperation but also take supplements that improve the gastrointestinal tract. Jie Li (garlic essence), produced by the Universe Pharmaceutical Factory, is a world-renowned medicine that protects the gastrointestinal tract, promotes health, and also has the natural functions of strengthening the lungs and killing bacteria. It is truly worth choosing for lung disease patients.

Economical Soap: Hygiene is the most important thing people should pay attention to because it can promote health and happiness. Therefore, everyone's clothing, food, housing, and transportation should be carefully considered, and the soap used in ordinary families is naturally no exception and should be carefully selected. Henry Soap has the function of protecting fiber quality. Whether it is for washing clothes, washing the face, or bathing, it can satisfy you everywhere. Moreover, it is of firm quality, easy to remove dirt, has abundant foam, and a rich fragrance. The price is also economical, making it worth a try.

### A Week's Home Cooking Menu

### The Future of Foreign Exchange

— Zhang Yifan

Funds Frozen in the United States Deeply Gratifies Me

During the May 2nd Trend last year, I proposed that the US government be requested to manage the funds of Chinese citizens in the US to compensate for the loophole that our country's foreign exchange control laws could not take effect in Shanghai, so as to crack down on speculation. I also published a lecture draft "How is the Future of Foreign Exchange" in the 319th issue of this journal (dated May 13 last year), stating on the one hand the possibility of close cooperation between Chinese and American currencies, and on the other hand mentioning that the US government might accept the Chinese government's request to freeze Chinese funds in the US (this lecture has been compiled and published by the author's bookstore in my lecture collection "Legal Tender. Foreign Exchange. Gold"). Here is what I said:

"As for the United States, if it has not established foreign exchange cooperation with China, it is not that the US government has no intention of doing so, but that the Chinese government has no intention of doing so. This should be specially mentioned... As long as the Chinese government intends to, the US government will be happy to establish foreign exchange cooperation with China, just like the current Sino-British foreign exchange cooperation." (Section 2 of the 319th issue of this journal or pages 71-72 of my book "Legal Tender Foreign Exchange Gold")

"The US Congress has long passed two resolutions: that is, authorizing President Roosevelt to implement foreign exchange controls in times of emergency; and to act as an agent to manage the deposits and all assets in the US of countries involved in warfare. The implementation of the former resolution means that the freedom to buy and sell US currency no longer exists. At the same time, the United States must find ways to maintain an exchange rate suitable for political purposes for the currencies of countries with similar interests. The implementation of the latter resolution means intercepting foreign deposits to cooperate with its political role; for example, intercepting Norwegian deposits to prevent them from flowing into German hands. Therefore, the funds that escaped from Shanghai to the United States may also be intercepted at the request of the Chinese government." (Section 3 of the 319th issue of this journal or pages 89 and 90 of my book "Legal Tender Foreign Exchange Gold")

At that time, friends laughed at me for being too idealistic, and another group of people thought that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan were all vying for monetary sovereignty over China. Since the United Kingdom had taken the lead, it would not allow a third party to intervene. They believed that the legal tender had no possibility of autonomy. However, entering this spring, when the United States loaned to China, it clearly stated that it would be used to maintain the legal tender, and then dispatched committee members to form a tripartite foreign exchange stabilization fund management committee with China and the United Kingdom. The day before yesterday, US President Roosevelt again personally ordered the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds in the United States, and explained that the freezing of Chinese funds was to accept the special request of Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek. Not only the United States is doing this, but even British-led Canada and the Straits Settlements have also frozen Chinese funds. However, the United Kingdom has not yet taken the same step, which is noteworthy.

Freezing Chinese funds in the United States is the most powerful and thorough countermeasure to crack down on foreign exchange speculation. Who doesn't know that foreign exchange speculation in recent years has centered on the US currency? Prices and gold prices also fluctuate with the US currency. And who doesn't recognize the United States as the world's only no-risk zone for fleeing funds? Now that the US government has implemented a freeze on all Chinese funds, all Chinese deposits hidden in the United States or American banks, and all funds belonging to the owners of American company stocks and other various securities, have all been subject to the freeze. At the same time, because Chinese funds exchanged for US currency will be frozen by the US government, no one is willing to take the risk of speculation and throw themselves into the net of freezing. The United States is the center of the modern international foreign exchange market. Since the movement of funds between China and the United States has lost its freedom, foreign exchange speculation in China has in fact lost its basis. And gold speculation has also become impossible due to the loss of its basis. Unless the US freezing order is lifted, these speculations may never return.

Since foreign exchange speculation is impossible, the appropriate and stable exchange rate will naturally follow. The past low exchange rate was originally a last resort; in order to prevent people from arbitraging, the price was devalued to cause losses to those who arbitraged; in fact, the losses suffered by China's foreign income and expenditure were several times greater; the losses suffered by the social economy due to high prices were even hundreds of thousands of times greater. Now that Chinese funds in the United States have been frozen, and Japanese funds in the United States are also being frozen, arbitrage will not happen at all. Therefore, the recovery of the exchange rate is necessary. Moreover, finding ways to release the frozen US currency can promote the natural rise of the foreign exchange market.

However, since the text of this freezing telegram was transmitted to the Shanghai market, the exchange rate has contracted sharply. This abnormal state is indeed surprising. The reason may be that foreigners, in view of the tense situation, are vigorously snapping up foreign exchange to prepare to go home; and American banks in Shanghai, because they are ordered to freeze Chinese deposits, Chinese people cannot dispose of them even if they want to. Therefore, a situation of supply falling short of demand has occurred. In addition, the HSBC's listed price is lower than the market exchange rate, so the low level will be taken as the standard by those supplied by HSBC. Is this why this temporary deformed state was created?

The Future of Sino-US Trade Relations

What deserves the most attention now is the future trade relationship between China and the United States. Because Chinese funds in the United States are now frozen, all new US dollars settled in the future cannot escape the freeze. All US dollars, whether old or new, that need to be used must first be approved by the US government. And whether the US government approves it or not, naturally, it will be based on the wishes of the Chinese government. Therefore, the trade between China and the United States in the future is in fact placed under the management of an organization. Therefore, the US trade in this Shanghai, which could have remained at large, and even in all ports in the occupied area, is still under the management of the Chinese government in an invisible way. This is obviously a policy that is absolutely beneficial to China.

However, the general public is worried about future prices because they are afraid that the approved supply of drafts will not be equal to the demand. This may affect prices. This concern should be observed from two aspects: on the one hand, one should study whether the imports are essential to us. The restriction of non-essential and even luxury goods is expected. But essential goods seem to be an exception. The second point should be to study the ownership of foreign exchange from the exports of the free zone and the occupied area. In order to guarantee the stability of the foreign exchange market in the future, and at the same time to guarantee that the foreign exchange from the exports of the free zone is not offset by the consumption of the occupied area, the Chinese government may decide on a principle that allows the foreign exchange needs of the imports of the free zone and the occupied area, and the supply power of foreign exchange resources, to balance each other. In other words: the maximum possible amount of import trade in the occupied area in the future is equal to the amount of its export trade. Therefore, the possibility of balancing the supply and demand of materials in the occupied area, and the possibility of stabilizing the social and economic order in the occupied area, will be determined by the degree of Japanese control over the materials in the occupied area. If Japan wants to ensure that its so-called policy of "using war to support war" implemented in the occupied area today is well-funded, it should slightly revise its current arbitrary actions at this time. If it remains the same as before, and continues to do whatever it wants as it does today, then the hope for imports of American goods in the occupied area is undoubtedly greatly in question.

Before the United States froze Chinese funds, the possibility of importing American goods in the occupied area was purely balanced by the movement of idle funds in the black foreign exchange market; therefore, although Japan controlled the materials in the occupied area and controlled its export foreign exchange, it still did not prevent the import of American goods. Now that all idle US dollars are under reasonable management, the possibility of importing American goods in the future can only be balanced by local export resources.

From the above, it can be seen that in terms of prices, it should also be divided into two parts, the occupied area and the free zone. In terms of consistency: because the exchange rate is bound to loosen, even if the price cannot be lowered, it has undoubtedly lost its basis for rising. In the free zone, there is nothing that cannot obtain a good influence, but in the occupied area, there is a proviso. That is, is import and export trade in equilibrium? And whether it can be balanced? Depends on whether Japan's attitude towards the policy of using war to support war is revised or not. If it wants to maintain the policy of using war to support war, then it must maintain the balance of import and export trade in the occupied area, otherwise the social economy of the occupied area is likely to collapse fundamentally.

However, these are all said on the premise that the objective environment remains unchanged; and speaking from the future evolution of the current possible situation, there are still other factors besides economic ones that deserve consideration.

### Deliberations on Special Reserve Provisions

— Xia Gaobo

1.  Summary of Measures

The Ministry of Economic Affairs announced eight items of the "Special Reserve Provisions for Industry and Commerce in Extraordinary Times" on April 14th, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' notification No. 30 Shangzi 08306: "Considering the high inflation during extraordinary times, the profits obtained by industry and commerce in the year-end settlement mostly contain 'virtual value'. If dividends are distributed according to normal methods, future price changes will make it impossible to recover the distributed dividends, greatly affecting the foundation of industry and commerce. Although the Company Law stipulates that one-tenth of the surplus should be set aside as a public reserve, the amount is too small to meet this need. In order to protect various industries and businesses, the Ministry has formulated eight items of the Special Reserve Provisions for Industry and Commerce in Extraordinary Times, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation by the Ministry… All companies and businesses must set aside reserves in accordance with the law when conducting annual settlements starting this year…" The following is a summary of the notification and measures of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

A. Motivation for setting aside special reserves – to offset losses caused by future sharp declines in prices.

B. Percentage of reserves to be set aside (1) If the surplus is more than one-fifth of the total paid-up capital, 10% of the surplus should be set aside; (2) If the surplus is more than one-fourth of the total paid-up capital, 20% of the surplus should be set aside; (3) If the surplus is more than one-third of the total paid-up capital, 30% of the surplus should be set aside.

C. Method of setting aside reserves – This is a cash reserve that should be specially deposited in a bank. It should be set aside within one month after the end of the business year, and the final financial statements should be submitted to the competent official for forwarding to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record.

D. Scope of use – Except for offsetting accidental losses, it may not be distributed without the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

E. Violations of these measures may be subject to a fine of up to 1,000 yuan in accordance with Article 232 of the Company Law.

F. Special reserves are not tax-exempt.

2.  Significance of Special Reserve Provisions

On the surface, setting aside special reserves seems to be only for the current benefit of industry and commerce, as the profits contain virtual value. Therefore, a portion is retained to offset future losses caused by sharp declines in prices. However, upon closer examination, it is not so simple. Here, I will discuss its significant meaning within my limited understanding:

From an accounting perspective, there are two ways for industry and commerce to retain profits for special purposes. One is a virtual reserve, which is to transfer a portion of the current profit on the books and indicate it with a specific account title, which is not allowed to be distributed to shareholders. The other is a real reserve, which is to actually set aside a portion of cash, either deposited in a bank or made into flexible and reliable investments for specific purposes in the future. Both are to avoid shareholder demands for distribution. Generally, commercial firms organized as companies set aside one-tenth of their surplus as a public reserve (commonly known as statutory public reserve) in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law, and one-tenth of their surplus as a war loss reserve (not mandatory) in accordance with the "Practical Relief for Industry and Commerce Relief Measures" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. Both are virtual reserves, so there is no actual cash reserve, and there are no definite assets to rely on. Therefore, once prices plummet, if the company does not retain a large amount of cash (legal tender or bank deposits), the value of this virtual reserve will inevitably depreciate greatly, because most assets, except for legal tender (or deposits), will generally fall with the fall in prices, while legal tender (or deposits) will be the opposite. The lower the price, the higher the currency value. Therefore, to avoid the impact of a sharp drop in prices, a real reserve is necessary. This is why, in addition to the statutory public reserve and war loss reserve, the Ministry of Economic Affairs specifically mandates the setting aside of cash special reserves. Therefore, although the motivation is very clear, the measures should not be taken lightly. This is one point.

Nowadays, prices are rising and falling sharply, and speculation is rampant. In addition to operating their own businesses, some merchants use idle funds for speculative activities, hoping to obtain illegal profits. The harm they cause to others is obvious and need not be repeated. Usually, companies retain surpluses at the end of the year and set aside reserves, mostly in the form of virtual reserves, which does not hinder the turnover of funds. With surplus funds available, it is easy to arouse the desire for speculation among managers, resulting in disguised gambling. Now, if cash reserves are set aside, the funds will inevitably be tight, which may reduce speculative activities. This is the second point. When companies deposit considerable cash in banks, reducing the amount of currency in circulation (this point will be discussed later), it can also slightly tighten the money supply, which can be somewhat beneficial to currency management. This is the third point.

3.  Several Issues Awaiting Discussion

The motivation for setting aside this special reserve is based on sound principles and is impeccable. However, there are still some aspects that seem to have flaws. Here, I will offer my humble opinions for analysis and discussion, hoping that the authorities will consider them carefully.

A. Discussion on the percentage – Whether the percentage set by the measures is appropriate will be discussed after comprehensively considering the statutory public reserve, income tax, excessive profit tax, war loss reserve, and the recent special reserve, dividing them into several levels, calculating the distribution of surplus figures, and then converting them into a percentage table below:

Now, based on the above table, let's make a further analysis, dividing the total surplus (100%) into (1) the company's retained portion (including the three items in the above table: statutory public reserve, war loss reserve, and special reserve), (2) taxes (income tax and excessive profit tax), (3) the surplus shareholders can enjoy, and (4) the ratio of the surplus shareholders can enjoy to the capital, compiling a percentage table to show their interrelationships. Examining the above table in detail, the following concepts can be obtained: (1) The company's retained portion is at most half of the surplus; (2) The tax payable is directly proportional to the size of the surplus; (3) The percentage of surplus shareholders can enjoy to the capital is a wave-shaped distribution. In other words, when the company's surplus equals the capital, shareholders can only obtain an annual interest rate of about 1.6% (i.e., the investment interest rate). If the company's surplus is greater or less than the capital, the investment interest rate will gradually decrease. If the company's profit rate is 300% (i.e., a company with 10,000 yuan of capital earns 30,000 yuan), the shareholders' investment interest rate is only 9%. This allocation is obviously unreasonable. In my opinion, although the investment interest rate cannot rise in proportion to the company's profit rate, it should at least rise moderately. For example, when the company's profit rate is 50%, the investment interest rate should at least be maintained at 20% or more. Therefore, the percentage of special reserves needs to be further considered. Otherwise, people in general will not be interested in normal investments, indirectly forcing private idle funds to take detours, which is a cause for concern.

(B) Discussion on not being tax-exempt – The cash special reserves set aside, on the surface, are temporarily restricting the distribution to shareholders and will still be part of the distributable surplus to shareholders in the future. Therefore, the regulation that "special reserves are not tax-exempt" seems reasonable. However, in fact, we believe that the decline in prices after the war is inevitable, but the degree of difference is only a matter of degree. The loss of inventory depreciation in industry and commerce during this turbulent period is also inevitable, but it is only a matter of degree. Then, in order to compensate for this loss or to revive the business after the war, this cash special reserve will most likely be used by the company and is less likely to be returned to shareholders, but the state levies taxes in advance, which does not seem fair. Therefore, the best way to be fair and equitable is to refer to the example of the "war loss reserve" and "temporarily not levy taxes" until after the war, after deducting the surplus number after offsetting accidental losses, and then calculate the income tax and profit tax that should be supplemented.

(C) Huge amount of cash and storage issues – Setting aside a huge amount of cash reserves is a good method, but whether such a huge amount of cash (for example, a company with 1 million yuan of capital, earning 250,000 yuan annually, must set aside 50,000 yuan of cash reserves, in addition to paying more than 2,000 yuan in taxes, and a dividend of 10% is 100,000 yuan, totaling more than 150,000 yuan) can actually be paid is quite a problem. Even if it can be paid temporarily, the turnover of funds in business operations will be greatly difficult after payment. If borrowing from a bank, the interest burden will be too heavy. Conversely, the interest on cash reserves is very low (especially in Shanghai). Therefore, I suggest that the government should mandate that this cash reserve be deposited in national banks or savings bureaus, without giving a reasonably generous interest rate. This can slightly reduce the interest burden on industry and commerce, and at the same time concentrate cash in national banks, which can not only avoid the arrogance of inflation, but also allow funds to be used properly.

(D) Preliminary suggestions on whether sole proprietorships or partnerships should set aside special reserves – According to the general practice in various countries, the year-end public reserve (Surplus) of industry and commerce is limited to limited liability companies. My company law is also the same (see Article 17 of the Company Law). Limited liability companies (i.e., limited companies) only bear liability for debts up to the legal capital. Therefore, the law further mandates them to set aside public reserves as a backing for the capital, which is actually the second guarantee for the company's creditors. Unlimited companies, sole proprietorships, or partnerships have unlimited liability for the principal, so there is no need for this second guarantee. If so, it is natural that sole proprietorships and partnerships do not need to set aside cash special reserves. However, I believe that in this extraordinary period, the profits of all industries are relatively high. Sole proprietorships and partnerships, because of the smaller number of people, and mostly relatives and friends, are more likely to be laissez-faire in their operations than companies, and the losses caused by the decline in prices are inevitable, and other accidental losses are also a cause for concern. And their annual profits have been fully distributed and cannot be recovered. If storms hit in the future, they will disperse and cause harm to others. The so-called unlimited liability may become a formality at this time. Therefore, I believe that in this extraordinary period, for the sake of social security and to protect the interests of creditors, even enterprises organized as sole proprietorships or partnerships should be legally forced to set aside special reserves as a precaution.

We fully agree with the principle of this method of setting aside cash special reserves, and hereby provide the above-mentioned discussions on its methods, hoping that the authorities will reconsider and make corrections or improvements, so that the law can become more perfect.

### Bamboo Baskets and Wicker Baskets

— Wang Yizhi

In modern times, the study of packaging materials has become a specialized field. For example, cellophane and artificial cellophane, which can temporarily preserve the freshness of packaged candies and pastries for many days, are crystal clear, refreshing, and brightly colored. Coupled with colorful printed pictures or text, the beauty and precision of industrial manufacturing often make people marvel. On the other hand, the oldest and most practical packaging materials are bamboo baskets, which are often overlooked by ordinary people. The vegetable basket commonly used by Shanghai people is the most obvious example. The history of baskets is very long. Baskets have existed in Africa for up to 7,000 years. The use of baskets by Native Americans has also been around for 6,000 years. The so-called ancient basket weavers by American anthropologists are named after their weaving of various rattan and reed utensils. Mesopotamia in the Near East has long produced waterproof bamboo baskets. The Dutch East Indies have long produced rattan and reed grasses suitable for weaving and packaging. These are the special skills of Eastern people, which cannot be easily monopolized by new industrial countries through the use of machines for mass production. According to the bamboo section of the Chinese dictionary, various items made of reed and bamboo are listed, such as round brushes and square cases made of reed, and round huts and square baskets made of bamboo. Square ones are called boxes, rectangular ones are called coffers, and round ones on the bottom and round ones on the top are called baskets. Larger ones are baskets and smaller ones are cages, larger ones are palaces and smaller ones are wicker baskets, and larger ones are boxes and smaller ones are chests. In addition, there are sieves for steaming food, baskets for carrying soil, winnows for receiving dust, cash boxes, baskets for holding meat, skimmers for washing rice, traps for catching fish, and hairpins for storing dates and chestnuts (pronounced fan). It is a grand spectacle that fully demonstrates the art of weaving. There is a common saying among Chinese people that one can live without meat but not without bamboo. If various countries in the West, which are currently facing a shortage of iron and wood strips, could study Chinese people's proficiency in using bamboo and thoroughly examine ancient Chinese books, they would be amazed by the precision of the analysis of various weaving utensils and words in the Eastern land of gentlemen. Western packaging experts have rightly pointed out that reed-woven utensils have four advantages when used for packaging. First, they are lightweight and easy to carry. Second, round reeds are smooth and not easy to cut hands. Third, they are not afraid of humidity, and are not afraid of drastic changes in the weather, and will not cause oxidation, which is far superior to using wood or iron, especially for the transfer of items in textile factories, as well as for the purposes of making cigarettes, washing clothes, and delivering noodles. Fourth, they are more suitable for holding fresh fruits and vegetables that are most vulnerable to bumps or pressure and often need air circulation than wooden strips woven or wooden pieces nailed together boxes. Hearing this, I thought that in recent decades, peddlers and sailors who went abroad to make a living, because they did not receive vocational education at home when they were young, had no special skills to rely on when they went abroad, and missed good opportunities and wasted precious time. It is countless. It is even more regrettable that they do not have the skills to weave bamboo baskets as a substitute for proper entertainment, and are bored and do nothing, and turn to gambling and opium. Occasionally, they have savings, but they lose them all at once. Now, fortunately, I have heard that the bamboo weaving, which China has been particularly good at for generations, is used as packaging materials and is so eagerly needed by Western society. If someone widely collects famous items, compiles and edits pictures, and then improves and promotes them, wouldn't there be a hope of promoting national glory to the world? I hope that those who are concerned about this matter will not neglect it because it is small.

### Resurgence of Hardware Price Surge

Since the news of the British and American freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds was released the day before yesterday, the Shanghai market has been highly volatile, and the prices of various goods have risen sharply. Hardware products are no exception. After several rounds of price increases, the standard of hardware prices has become extremely high, with the lowest increase being five times the previous price, and even ten times or dozens of times being not surprising. The main reason is the lack of overseas sources. However, the hoarding of goods by speculators is also a decisive factor in raising prices. However, in the future, due to the sluggish sales in various markets and the small amount of goods disposed of by foreign customers, the market had stabilized for a while. Since the day before yesterday, due to the drastic changes in the market atmosphere, the industry has been optimistic, so the prices of various goods have risen again. In addition, with the focus of speculators, they have again implemented their methods of collecting and hoarding, and have absorbed a large amount of goods. As a result, the prices of various goods have been raised again. For example, the price of factory nails has risen from 170 yuan to 190 yuan, and it is even possible to break through the 200 yuan mark. The price of 37-inch Dongbai iron sheet has risen sharply from 16-17 yuan per sheet to 33-34 yuan. The price of 36-inch iron sheet is also close to 30 yuan. The new dish dollar has a great momentum of 250 yuan. The price of solder has reached 1,200 yuan. The price of cyan powder has risen from 470 yuan per load to 530-540 yuan.

### Rumor: US Senate Passes Freeze on Cotton Loan Funds

The New York cotton market initially fell due to selling pressure, but then rose again due to large-scale purchases and news from Washington that the Senate Agriculture Committee had approved the freezing of cotton loan funds. As a result, the closing price rose by 14 to 21 points per pound compared to the previous day.

### General Sharp Rise in Grocery Prices

The cigarette market situation is alarming. This is also due to financial changes and unusually enthusiastic sentiment. Holders are unwilling to sell, and the market is becoming more and more expensive with less goods. In addition, the factory has not been able to distribute goods for a long time, and the buying price is becoming more and more tight. For example, the price of Great Britain brand has risen to 1,770 yuan per box, Old Knife brand has risen to 1,370 yuan, Little Fairy brand has risen to 995 yuan, and Five Flowers brand has risen to 892 yuan. The prices of various brands have risen sharply by more than 50 yuan. It seems that it will continue to rise.

The opening price of daily necessities yesterday rose sharply again. This is due to financial fluctuations, and everyone is optimistic. It is estimated that each box of solid-colored soap is 56 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap is 46 yuan, and Huang Xiangmao soap is 44 yuan, which is 3-4 yuan higher than yesterday. The price of Phoenix brand matches is 800 yuan per box, and the price of Beauty brand is 830 yuan, which is also more than 50 yuan higher than yesterday. The price of Ship brand candles is 33.5 yuan per box.

### More on "Student Aid"

— Damei

Since the solicitation of student aid by this newspaper, it has received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life. In a few days, it has reached a huge amount, which is very encouraging. Recently, registration for applications has begun, and underprivileged students have been flocking to the office to obtain application forms. Application procedures: All students are requested to pay attention to the following: personally fill out the original and duplicate application forms in detail (and have them signed by parents and principals); submit the school transcripts and other documents for the most recent semester; sincerely accept the review; and do not postpone the application. The newspaper is very cautious about the arrangement of student aid, and it is strictly reviewed by a special committee, so everything is extremely fair and correct. The following is a statement of the author's humble intention, which is published for the benefit of readers. ——Editor

Since this newspaper launched the "Student Aid," it has made considerable progress in a few short days. This not only solves some difficulties for a small number of students, but also shows the importance society attaches to education. We have great sympathy for the "Student Aid," and we must pay attention to this movement again and again:

1.  Student aid is not simply a relief endeavor. Some people tend to attach a full sense of relief to "education loans" and "student aid." This is not the case. The initiators use the excuse of helping students who are struggling to get financial help from all walks of life, and the recipients also hope to get financial aid because of the pain of dropping out of school. Therefore, on the surface, it is no different from a relief endeavor. However, we should thoroughly understand that although "student aid" is based on compassion, it is more active than other social relief endeavors. We must know that helping young people actually contains the educational value of mutual assistance, encouragement, and finding talents for the country. Therefore, private or group scholarship institutions should first form a kind of honorary award, so that the recipients not only enjoy some material benefits and feel a little comforted, but also the donors should think that this is a very valuable undertaking, and it is by no means a pure act of giving grace to others. If both parties recognize this clearly, the effect will be even greater.

2.  Measures should be absolutely prudent. Since "student aid" is received from the society, it should be used by the society, and there should be no fraud or luck. Are the applicants truly "underprivileged" and "excellent"? At present, although the procedures of the scholarship institutions are said to be thoughtful, in fact, the truly underprivileged and excellent people sometimes cannot get scholarships, and some students may pass by trickery or luck. If this phenomenon occurs, it is wrong. Therefore, it is extremely important to make sure that every penny has an effect in the distribution. At the same time, we must also establish close contact with the school authorities and the recipients to motivate and supervise them. After the aid is given, we should also conduct investigations from time to time. It is best to have a kind of academic report so that he can think of his environment and the expectations of others for him, so that he can achieve the true purpose of the award. In addition, it is best to have private conversation opportunities (private loan institutions have this measure), which means that the meticulous review contains more practical meaning.

In addition, each recipient should have a thorough self-reflection on how to be worthy of others? We must trust ourselves and always be vigilant with the honor of receiving help from others. Academic, character, will, and mind should all be directed to the path of light. It is the most valuable record in life to create a future for yourself in hardship, especially since you are an excellent student who endures social favors and burdens!

Finally, people think that student aid should be expanded and developed, especially today. If every time it is held can achieve good results, then everyone in the society will be happy to help, and the result will not only be to help a few struggling students.

### Contradiction

Teacher: "Now that summer has arrived, flies are very good at spreading diseases. I hope that all of you children will pay attention to cleanliness and not buy food from vendors."

Student: "Teacher, I saw you eating Yangchun noodles at the stall yesterday morning."

Teacher: "This..." (touches his head)

### Begonia

— Yu Wenma

11\. Midnight Song

Later, as he grew older, he could no longer play the eighth and ninth sisters in "Si Lang Visits His Mother" or Miss Xu in "Two Entries to the Palace." He really did not want to play the role of a dragon runner who held flags and umbrellas, so he had no choice but to abandon his bowl of rice and run to the countryside to seek refuge with his old aunt and uncle. But whenever people mentioned opera, he could not help but brag about it, saying that his own skills were almost better than Mei Lanfang's, and that the lives of those popular actors were more extravagant than those of princes and ministers. Although there were a few discerning people in Zhangshu Village who secretly regarded him as a madman, most people believed him and said that Old Master Shang the Second of the Meng family was an old hero in the opera world who was out of luck.

The idea of ​​taking in a talented apprentice to rely on for the rest of his life came from one of his former colleagues. That person's surname was Li, and he was also a dan actor with both beauty and talent. He had been on stage for thirty years. The most remarkable time was when he replaced someone else to sing the fourth wife. Later, he was accepted as an apprentice by a rich family's child. It was also his old luck. With his skills, he did not ruin the child. As soon as he came on stage, he suddenly became popular because of his handsome appearance and loud voice. All the dividends he received were given to the teacher. Anyone who invited guests had to support him. The child's family could not negotiate because they had written a paper at the beginning!

When Old Master Shang the Second learned about this, he made up his mind! But he could not find a good-quality child for several years. When he saw Mei Bao, he liked him at first sight, but he was already studying in school, and his father loved him so much that he could not think of any way to start.

"If the girl from the Wu family across the street is willing to learn opera from me, Mei Lanfang will be finished in three years!" During the period when Begonia was sick, he saw his nephew's wife go to Mei Bao's house to help every day, knowing that they had become quite close, so he deliberately exaggeratedly said again and again.

It happened that his nephew's wife was the first "meddler" in Zhangshu Village. After her encouragement, Mei Bao was tricked into it. (169)

### Freezing Funds and Reaffirming Previous Orders!

— Ru Zhu

The "Regulations for Punishing Hoarding and Profiteering" had already been issued by the National Government. Now, to make them more concrete and practical, a "Provisional Statute for Punishing Crimes Against Food Management During Extraordinary Times" has been promulgated. We believe this move is a necessary measure. However, two points are worth noting here:

First, setting the standard for punishment based on the amount of hoarding is commendable, as it clearly distinguishes between rewards and punishments, provided it is earnestly implemented.

Secondly, public officials should be punished "one degree more severely" (as reported in the newspapers). This is because officials, "using their advantageous positions and power to hoard food," intimidate ordinary citizens, preventing them from reporting or even daring to report.

However, being in an "isolated island," we cannot directly benefit and deeply feel the inconvenience.

Of course, we will not oppose the "killing the chicken to scare the monkey" "trick," but removing insignificant "small weights" will not necessarily balance the scales, and the people's burden will remain just as heavy.

Indeed, the promulgation of this regulation still has its value and significance. It can be said that it is a stern warning to Shanghai, where the speculative atmosphere is very intense.

But coincidentally, just as this was happening, the news of the United States announcing the "freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds" spread throughout the world. People near radios were driven dizzy by the waves of electricity coming from America. As a result, the market followed with "a chorus of price increases!"

Tickets, US dollars, British pounds, cotton yarn, rice, cooking oil, coal briquettes... everything rose one after another, either tightening or soaring, and the impact on the lives of citizens was enormous!

But is this price increase justified? Please consider the following reasons.

First, this freeze is not only for China; it is to prevent the misuse of Chinese foreign exchange and was done at China's request.

Second, the freeze on China is not only beneficial, but the United States has also ordered fourteen major banks to redeem US dollars to maintain the normal development of legitimate commerce and to crack down on speculative commerce. Therefore, it is no wonder that they feel it is their doomsday and wail.

Third, if speculators recklessly raise prices regardless of everything, then the facts will tell them that this is just a last-ditch struggle! And freezing funds? It's just a "death warrant" for them!

Therefore, the conclusion here is:

Freezing funds will not only not affect prices, but can reduce the countercurrent of speculation, lower the insane prices of existing commodities, and benefit the people's livelihood.

The National Government's reiteration of orders should not only not be diluted by the freezing of funds, but is precisely a move that coincides perfectly - freezing funds is like a bucket of cold water poured on the "hoarders and profiteers"!

### Blitzkrieg

— Qi

Customer: "How much are these socks?"

Roadside vendor: "Two yuan and fifty cents."

Customer haggling: "Will you sell them for fifty cents?"

Lightning-fast reply: "Okay, I'll sell them to you."

Rice shop owner hurrying back from the market: "The market price has gone up again today, each load is five or six yuan higher. People are still expecting it to go higher. Quickly mix in more broken rice, and raise the retail price by another ten yuan across the board!"

The shop assistants immediately set about "serving" the customers.

### A Seemingly Easy Difficulty

— Jia

Suppose someone took a thirteen-column abacus and asked you, "If you add one to each column from the rightmost one, carrying over to the left when it reaches ten, and carrying over to the further left when the left column reaches ten, how long will it take to reach one in the leftmost column?" If you don't think for a moment, you will answer, "This is indeed a time-consuming task, but a whole day's work should be enough!" Let me tell you: this is an impossible task. If you add at a rate of ·00 per minute, then it is 8.000 per hour, and calculating for a whole day, it is 144·000 per day, and 92·560·000 per year, and 515·600·000·000 in 10,000 years. But the number on the leftmost column when it is one is 1·000·000·000·000, but how many years does a person live?

### Lament for Elder Yun Shi

— Yang Wuyang

Parting at the Altar of Millet, like an arrow, how many years south of the sky have I spent drunk and humming poetry, abandoning my ambitions and refusing to climb the Yan Wu couch, supporting my old age and willingly wield the Lu Yang spear; on the sickbed, composing chapters praising peace, on the battlefield ruins, singing of beautiful wheat, deeply ashamed that the old example of Fan Mountain has been created, rumors from overseas are but misrepresentations. (Elder Yun mistakenly believed the bad news of Fan Mountain and hastily composed ten poems of mourning; I am also like Yun Weng's Fan Mountain.)
