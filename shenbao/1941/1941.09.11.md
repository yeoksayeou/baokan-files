### US-Received Danish Cargo Ship Sunk off Iceland; Washington State Department Officially Announces Loss of 24 Crew Members of the "West Sesia"

United Press International, Washington, 10th (Urgent Telegram) - The State Department learned yesterday afternoon that the Panamanian ship "West Sesia," under American management, was torpedoed off Iceland on August 17th, with 24 crew members lost, including one American. The three survivors were rescued on September 8th. Unofficial sources here say that the American cargo ship "Steel Mariner," recently sunk in the Red Sea, had its lights on and American torches displayed when it was bombed. The only American crew member of the "West Sesia" was a radio operator named Mohammed, aged 44. The ship's crew included one Irishman, seven Danes, two Norwegians, two Swedes, two Icelanders, five Portuguese, one Belgian, five Britons, one Spaniard, and the Danish shipowner, Nielsen. The State Department announced that the "West Sesia" was carrying food, grain, timber, and other ordinary goods, with no munitions or war ordnance. The cargo belonged to the Icelandic government. The State Department's announcement regarding the sinking of the "West Sesia" stated that a naval department notified the State Department on the morning of September 6th that the naval department had rescued three surviving crew members of the "West Sesia" about 300 miles southwest of Iceland. The other 21 crew members are presumed lost. The State Department learned that the survivors said the ship was torpedoed on August 17th. One of the crew members was an American, whose name is unknown and who was not among the survivors. The State Department has also not received notification of the names of the three rescued. The "West Sesia" was formerly a Danish ship, obtained by the Danish government under the recent law permitting the reception of idle foreign cargo ships in American territorial waters. The ship was registered in Panama and was carrying supplies from the Icelandic government to Iceland, including food, grain, materials, and other ordinary goods, but no munitions. A State Department spokesman said that the ship was received by the U.S. Maritime Commission and managed by a company in New York during the voyage.

United Press International, Washington, 10th - Responsible officials declared that the American war threat has shifted from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and said that Germany may be adopting unrestricted warfare against maritime navigation. They cited the sinking of the American ships Greer, West Sesia, and Steel Mariner as evidence.

International News Service, Red Sea Port, 10th - All 36 officers and soldiers of the American cargo ship "Steel Mariner" safely landed here yesterday. It is said that when the bomber sank the ship, the ship and the American flag were clearly visible. The rescued could not identify the aircraft, but all identified it as "German."

Washington Political Circles Stirred Up; Believe Germany Will Drag America Into War

Universal News Service, Washington, 10th - The recent attacks on American ships have caused a stir in political circles here, and it is believed that Churchill's warning that Nazi actions against American Atlantic patrol routes may be consistent, and should be taken very seriously. It was previously generally believed here that Hitler would avoid attacks on American ships, fearing American anger. However, some now believe that Hitler, in his recklessness, may order attacks, repeating the mistakes of the German Emperor in 1917. Hitler is aware that this action may drag the United States into the war.

United Press International, Washington, 10th - The news of the sinking of the American-managed, Panama-registered cargo ship "West Sesia" coincides with Churchill's warning that Hitler may expand the war to the Americas. Oklahoma Democratic Senator Thomas said, "As a result of the Greer incident, the United States has committed to providing greater naval assistance to England." Secretary of State Hull said at a press conference that although the "West Sesia" flew the Panamanian flag, it was managed by an American company. Hull said, "We can have no doubt who instigated the attack on the 'West Sesia'," but he would only discuss it after receiving more reports. The announcement of the sinking of the "West Sesia" followed the announcement of the bombing of the "Steel Mariner" at the mouth of the Suez Canal, 48 hours after the Greer incident. The development of the situation strengthens the belief that the American Navy will meet force with force in American territorial waters, challenging any German attempt to cut off British supply routes.

American Policy Is Changing; Determined to Ensure Maritime Routes

Reuters, Washington, 10th - There is now reason to believe that the sinking of the American ships "Steel Mariner" and "West Sesia" by the Germans, and the attack on the American ship Greer by the Germans, are currently prompting a change in American policy. It is believed here that the sinking of the "West Sesia" is more important than the other two incidents. The fact that the "West Sesia" flew the Panamanian flag may not change the American reaction, as the ship is American-owned and is being re-registered from Panama to the United States. There is much speculation as to why the news of the sinking of the "West Sesia" was not announced for so long. According to Reuters, the U.S. Marine Corps radio station in Iceland reported last Thursday that the "West Sesia" was overdue and feared it had been torpedoed. Neither the British nor American radio stations seemed to have received this message, so the State Department's announcement of the ship's sinking yesterday came as a shock. It is believed that the reason this news was not announced earlier was to await detailed reports from the rescued crew members. Reuters has learned from reliable sources that President Roosevelt originally intended to announce the sinking on a broadcast on Sunday night, but due to the death of his mother, it was postponed to a broadcast on Thursday. At that time, the President is expected to respond to Churchill's call for continued naval assistance. In fact, Churchill had already received a response before making this call, as the President's broadcast speech was already drafted and scheduled to be delivered on Sunday. It is said that the President will explain in his broadcast that due to the Nazi attacks on American ships, the Atlantic patrol policy will be changed. Well-informed sources believe that President Roosevelt will announce an inviolable maritime route between the United States and Iceland, and that any hostile warships found on this route will be destroyed. In other words, any German submarine, surface vessel, or aircraft entering this area will risk destruction by the U.S. Navy, and even if they only enter the area, it will be regarded as a hostile act and destroyed. The width of this maritime route is not yet known, but it can be guessed that it will be wide enough to ensure the absolute safety of supplies to Britain between the United States and Iceland.

Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Advocates Repealing the Neutrality Act

Reuters, Washington, 10th - According to reliable rumors from well-informed sources, President Roosevelt will, in his speech tomorrow, demand that Germany pay close attention to the American ship and life losses caused by Nazi actions. It is said that the United States has lost a total of five ships for the aforementioned reasons, and the number of American casualties should be at least 65. It is said that the American President is still engaged in drafting this speech. Although there is no news yet as to whether the President will announce any action to realize the respect of American maritime rights, it is believed that the President will clearly state that the United States insists on maritime liberalism, without any doubt. Chairman Bloom of the House Foreign Affairs Committee declared that the Neutrality Act, which binds our assistance to Britain, should be repealed.

### US Secretary of State Convenes Meeting of Far East Experts to Prepare for Future Policy Towards Japan

International News Service, Washington, 10th - Secretary of State Hull convened an important meeting of his Far East affairs advisors yesterday, while the United States awaits Japan's announcement of its "major decision," which it has agreed to announce tomorrow. This decision will affect Japan's military policy. It is believed that the purpose of the meeting convened by Hull is to prepare countermeasures in case Konoe's declaration further strains the Pacific relations between Japan and the United States, and how to respond. However, some also believe that Konoe may announce that Japanese policy has changed, with U.S.-Japan harmony as the principle, or even abandoning the Axis. At the same time as Hull convened the meeting, the U.S. Tariff Commission published a detailed survey of Japanese goods imported into the United States, proving that if this trade were completely stopped, it would have no impact on the American defense program or the nation's future.

### Toyota Privy Council Explains US-Japan Negotiations

United Press International, Tokyo, 10th - Reliable sources claim that Foreign Minister Toyota revealed at the Privy Council today, when explaining the European situation, that the current friendly negotiations between Japan and the United States are proceeding. Observers have noticed that Japanese and American officials and business circles are gradually becoming optimistic about the possibility of success in friendly relations between Japan and the United States. Japanese newspapers also seem to be making every effort to promote this, so they have all stopped publishing anti-American commentary.

United Press International, Washington, 10th - Reports were received from international sources yesterday that some major figures believe that Germany will not be able to win this war, so Japan is attempting to reduce its relationship with the Axis powers and, to the extent possible, quickly strengthen its relations with Britain and the United States in order to "save face." However, this report did not indicate that Japan would openly or formally break with the Axis powers. According to the report, this move would be extremely dangerous and could cause serious internal repercussions. A Tokyo spokesman's criticism said that if the United States could resume oil shipments to Japan, Japan would not oppose the United States shipping oil to the Soviet Union. This move illustrates an example of Japan adjusting its national relations with the United States. Informed circles speculate that Prime Minister Konoe's recent declaration seems to be telling the Japanese people that the United States and Japan have begun negotiations to improve relations between the two countries. It is believed that this kind of negotiation is of a "probing nature," seeking ways for Japan to obtain a "glorious" retreat from its current predicament. It is said that Japan may later abandon the Axis, allowing the Soviet Union's resistance to remain tenacious.

United Press International, Tokyo, 10th - The board of directors of the American School in Japan met today to discuss liquidating the school. As a result, it was decided to continue occupying the current school building, but the semester will be temporarily postponed. This move reflects the growing hope for friendly relations between Japan and the United States.

### US Railway Workers Prepare to Strike; Nearly One Million Participants

Reuters, Washington, 10th - The leaders of 19 railway labor unions were ordered last Friday to launch a strike. Among them, the non-mechanical workers' union has about 900,000 members and has set Thursday as the strike date. The mechanical workers' union, with five branches totaling 350,000 members, has set September 15th as the strike date. They are demanding wage increases. According to the Railway Labor Act, whenever the above situation occurs, President Roosevelt must appoint an investigation committee to report within one month, so the strike date set by the union may not be the real date of the work stoppage, because a legal strike cannot be launched within 30 days after the investigation committee reports. President Roosevelt is expected to return to Washington today and will select this committee.

### Allied Forces Complete Mission; Withdraw from Spitsbergen Island; Not a Single Resident Left on the Island; All Coal Mines Destroyed

Reuters, London, 10th - Officials announced that the British Allied forces who had been dispatched to the Spitsbergen Islands have safely returned to England, and that the islands have been left with nothing that can be used by the enemy. The Allied forces, during their brief stay in the Spitsbergen Islands, destroyed the coal mines, including 150,000 tons of stored coal, and destroyed a radio station that had been providing valuable information to the Germans. All the residents of the island have been evacuated, without leaving a single person behind. When Canadian troops landed on the island in small boats, they were greeted by a reception committee who showered them with candy and cigarettes. The residents of the island then assisted the Canadian troops in carrying out the destruction work.

United Press International, Berlin, 10th - German authorities commented yesterday on the British landing in Spitsbergen, saying, "We wish them a stable winter there." There was no other movement or legal strike. President Roosevelt is expected to return to Washington today and will select this committee.

### Duff Cooper Arrives in Singapore; Will Visit Burma, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies

Reuters, Singapore, 10th - Duff Cooper, the British War Cabinet's Special Representative for the Far East, arrived here yesterday. It is said that although the heat from Japan has not subsided, its momentum seems to have slowed down, which is quite gratifying. Reuters has learned that U.S. Minister to Thailand, Baker, also arrived here on the same plane as Cooper, and the two have had several frank conversations, both of whom said that these conversations may be very useful in the future. Cooper stated that we are currently working closely with the United States, and this cooperation is extremely important. I think it is fair to say that neither Britain nor the United States wants to see the war spread to the Pacific, but if it cannot be avoided, we are prepared to deal with any developments. Cooper concluded that he would visit Burma, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies to investigate the situation in the Far East, and may also visit Chongqing, but not necessarily Japan.

Editorial

### The United States, Germany, and Japan

The speech that Roosevelt was preparing to deliver on the 8th of this month was unfortunately postponed to today due to the death of his mother. In these three days, new developments have occurred in both the Eastern and Western situations: on the one hand, following the Greer incident, the sinking of the "Steel Mariner" cargo ship and the announcement of the loss of the "West Sesia" have occurred; on the other hand, between the United States and Japan, there have been new developments after recent close contacts. With this delay, Roosevelt's original speech will inevitably be revised to adapt to these new situations, and the general public will also have the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of U.S. policy and reaction.

In the early stages of this European war, Germany acted cautiously to avoid offending the United States, so even though there were countless instances of sinking American ships during the U.S. neutrality in the previous Great War, Germany did not violate American maritime rights until recently, for over a year. This shows that the recent series of attacks on American ships, which Germany has brazenly admitted, are by no means accidental. In the Greer and Steel Mariner incidents, Germany used the excuse that the American ships had entered the blockade zone as the only reason, regardless of whether this was a decision that the United States, which insists on maritime freedom, could hardly recognize, and the U.S. government has never agreed to include the Red Sea and the vicinity of Iceland in the so-called war zone. Germany's intention is nothing more than to anger the United States, risking the consequences of American participation in the war. As this newspaper mentioned some days ago, if this strategy had been implemented a year earlier, it might have further strengthened the isolationist sentiments, causing some Americans who are accustomed to comfort to retreat in fear; however, with the maturity of American participation in the war and the decline of the Nazi momentum, it is extremely obvious that the submarine atrocities are not enough to deter the United States. It is also difficult to achieve the desire to drag the United States into the war. In May and June of this year, German submarines were most active in the Atlantic, causing great difficulties for British shipping of war materials and food, but since the United States expanded its patrol system and Britain has been keen to improve its naval tactics, the situation has improved greatly. Churchill's report on the war situation yesterday provided detailed explanations on this point. The main force of the U.S. Navy is not in the Atlantic, but with the cooperation of the British and American naval and air forces in that area, dealing with the German aircraft that can only attack opportunistically, even if there are still some difficulties, does not necessarily require the United States to formally participate in the war to overcome. Therefore, although the United States is one step closer to the edge of the war, it does not seem to be immediately drawn into the war by German provocations, not to mention that the Neutrality Act still exists, and there is still a considerable distance from the current situation to actual combat. On the other hand, even if Hitler has the intention of dragging the United States into the war, he will not be reckless enough to automatically declare war on the United States. That would not only fail to boost his momentum but would also promote the disintegration of the Tripartite Pact. As early as a few months ago, the Japanese authorities had stated that if the U.S.-German war broke out because of German aggression against the United States, Japan could not be obligated to go to the rescue.

If Japan still had the strength to fight, or if it had the confidence that the Nazis would win, then at a time when Germany was constantly provoking the United States, Japan would inevitably seek to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfill its expansionist desires while fulfilling its alliance obligations. However, although the signing of the Tripartite Pact has only been a year, everything has changed. The deterioration of U.S.-German relations has not aroused any interest from Japan. The twelve meetings between Grew and Toyota in a week are sufficient evidence that Japan attaches far greater importance to U.S.-Japan relations than to its alliance obligations. If German actions have any impact on Japan at this time, it is only to make U.S.-Japan talks more active. Perhaps the United States will temporarily treat Japan kindly, but it will never enhance the effect of the Tripartite Pact. In the current international situation, anyone with a little discernment can see that the Nazi decline is increasing day by day, and the difficulties are becoming more and more severe. Even in the war against the Soviet Union, the strategic indecision and the insignificant war results are readily apparent. With the imminent arrival of the severe winter, Hitler may not repeat Napoleon's mistakes. After the successive solutions to the problems of Iraq, Syria, and Iran, the only possibility of the East-West violence camps merging together has also been blocked. Given these facts, Japan has been forced to consider its own interests. The recent negotiations between the United States and Japan are intended to open up a way out of the predicament for Japan, and at the same time, they hope to open up a new path under the indulgence of Britain and the United States. Regardless of whether it leaves the Axis or not, it can be asserted that Germany will not be able to achieve the practical results of the Tripartite Pact due to the deterioration of U.S.-German relations. However, this plan of Japan is only for temporary gain. It is not a cessation of expansion, and even less a fundamental repentance.

In recent days, there has been a great deal of talk that a U.S.-Japan compromise is about to be reached. In terms of the current situation, it is indeed not impossible. However, at most, this is only a temporary peace and by no means a resolution of the major issues. As of today, there are no common points between the United States and Japan, either psychologically or politically. According to what Churchill indicated yesterday, the current British and American policies toward Japan are the same as the Eight-Point Declaration, both stemming from the decisions of the recent Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. Since the Eight-Point Declaration outlines the main goals of the British and American war efforts, the policies toward Japan decided at the same meeting should not be inconsistent with it in spirit. In addition, the recent statements and assurances issued by the U.S. authorities regarding the Far East problem indirectly illustrate the outline of the U.S.-Japan talks. As for the problems between China and Japan, the Chinese authorities have repeatedly stated that regardless of whether the United States and Japan touch upon this, there is no need to worry about it. All of this, Roosevelt's speech tonight, I believe, will be able to provide a satisfactory elaboration.

### Red Army on the Central Front Launches a Fierce General Counter-Offensive; German Army Collapses Westward for Twenty Kilometers; Soviets Achieve Unprecedented Victory, Nation Rejoices

International News Service, Moscow, 10th - Today's news: the Soviet Army on the central front launched a major counter-offensive, defeating 100,000 German troops and recapturing more than 50 villages, and is now approaching Smolensk. At the same time, the Red Army High Command stated that the defending forces of Leningrad and Odessa have repeatedly resisted the enemy's offensive. The Romanian army in Odessa suffered heavy losses. The High Command officially announced for the first time that the Soviet Army has changed from a partial counter-offensive to a general counter-offensive, but also acknowledged that the situation in Leningrad is critical. Marshal Timoshenko's victory in this counter-offensive on the central front has caused the Soviet Union to rejoice throughout the country, as it is the greatest victory in recent times.

TASS, Moscow, 10th - The "Pravda" newspaper, in a commentary, emphasized the importance of the Red Army's great victory near Smolensk, saying that after the Red Army recaptured the city of Yartsevo, the German attempt to attack Moscow has completely failed, because the purpose of the German occupation of Yartsevo was to use the city to concentrate heavy troops to capture the Soviet capital. The newspaper further stated that after the Red Army defeated eight German divisions and recaptured more than 50 villages and towns, it continued to advance, and the current artillery line is 20 kilometers away from Yartsevo.

United Press International, London, 10th - Authoritative sources stated that the Soviet Army also launched a counter-offensive in the Gomel area yesterday. Although its scale may be smaller than the counter-offensive in the Yartsevo area, it has been successful. But they believe that it is not yet sufficient to prevent the German army from advancing southeast from Gomel. There were also fierce battles elsewhere on the Leningrad front, but there were no obvious changes.

United Press International, London, 10th - British authorities stated yesterday that the Soviet Union has mobilized 10 million to 15 million soldiers and has inflicted greater casualties on Germany in three months than in any year of the First European War. The battle of Leningrad has intensified. It is heard that in the fierce fighting, Berlin believes that the German army will occupy Leningrad and Odessa before the snowfall in November. At the same time, according to British sources, Germany has sent 500,000 additional troops from the occupied areas in Europe and Germany to the Soviet Union to defend the 100-mile front from Finland to Lake Ladoga.

Germany Claims to Have Occupied Schlüsselburg; Intensifies Encirclement of Leningrad

International News Service, Berlin, 10th - Today, a special communiqué was issued here on the progress of the German-Soviet war, stating that the German army has occupied Schlüsselburg to the east of Leningrad and has completely encircled Leningrad. The communiqué also stated that because the German and Finnish armies have occupied the source of electricity supply, the electricity outside Leningrad has been completely cut off from the city. The German radio station praised this victory today, saying that Leningrad is the most important industrial city in the Soviet Union after Moscow, and 50% of the country's shipbuilding industry is concentrated there. It also said that the occupation of Schlüsselburg has enabled the Germans to completely control all ships on the Neva River and the White Sea Canal. The German High Command stated today that Leningrad is now under heavy artillery fire, and the city's 3 million residents are currently under heavy bombing by the German air force.

Red Army Crosses River and Inflicts Heavy Losses on Italian Army; Battles in Odessa Region Stall

United Press International, New York, 10th - The United Press International radio station here obtained a report acknowledging that Soviet troops have crossed the Dnieper River again, an area where the Italian army is stationed.

Reuters, London, 10th - Recent German war reports stated that the Ukrainian front, where the Italian army is stationed, has stalled due to the strength of the Odessa defenses.

TASS, Moscow, 10th - There are still fierce battles near Odessa, the southern city. The Romanian army suffered extremely heavy losses. In the past ten days, the Romanian army has lost 20,000 officers and soldiers. The First Regiment of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet Marines fought extremely bravely, constantly attacking the enemy. In the past three days, the regiment annihilated two Romanian regiments and obtained a large number of spoils of war.

### British Prime Minister in the House of Commons Reviewing the General War Situation: Naval Battles Improving, but the Crisis Remains; Determined to Fully Support the Soviet Union and Strive for Final Victory

Reuters, London, 10th: British Prime Minister Churchill yesterday reviewed the general war situation in the House of Commons, speaking in detail about the Atlantic war. He said, "The public has the impression that the situation in the last two months has greatly improved, and I cannot disagree. The improvement in naval battles is evident in two aspects. On the one hand, there has been a significant reduction in the loss of British and Allied ships and a substantial increase in the tonnage of goods safely arriving at our ports, which not only makes up for my estimate at the beginning of this year for the quantity of goods imported in 1941 but also exceeds it. On the other hand, there has been a sharp increase in the number of German and Italian ships lost in the past three months. This is due to the development of new tactics by the British Coastal Command and bomber squadrons, as well as the achievements of British submarines. The number of enemy ships destroyed by our air force and submarines is very large, which I hope the House will pay attention to. In July and August, the losses of British and Allied ships due to enemy actions were less than one-third of the German and Italian ships sunk by our aircraft and submarines. This is particularly important because our ships at sea are ten or twenty times more likely to be targeted by the enemy than enemy ships are to be targeted by us. Enemy ships only make short voyages across narrow seas or travel between fortified ports under aircraft protection, unlike our worldwide trade, with more than two thousand ships constantly at sea, and even in dangerous areas, there are always hundreds or more."

Allied Submarine Force Achieves Excellent Results

The British armed force that has suffered the most losses and faced the greatest dangers in this war is undoubtedly the submarine force. It is estimated that in 1941, British submarines sank or severely damaged seventeen enemy warships, including several enemy submarines. Enemy supply ships were also sunk by British submarines. On average, fifteen enemy ships were sunk each month, which means one ship was destroyed every two days. These supply ships included many troop transports and oil tankers, mostly traveling through the Mediterranean to supply enemy forces in Libya. The combined actions of the Dutch and Free French naval submarines have led to these excellent results.

German Acoustic Mines No Longer a Major Threat

Mines are not often heard of as a problem now, but every night, thirty or forty enemy aircraft use various methods to drop mines in areas where ships may pass. These attacks often involve acoustic and magnetic mines, but British science and organization have overcome them, so they are not often heard of as a problem. The British have two hundred people and one thousand ships working tirelessly every morning, using many novel devices to clear the deadly weapons the enemy has planted at night in ports and straits. Regardless of the weather or enemy attacks, this work has never stopped. We have never heard of it because this work is carried out in secret and is never publicized. Since the beginning of the war, salvage work has recovered more than one million tons of sunken ships. Although maritime losses in July and August have been greatly reduced, it would be foolish to say that the current serious dangers have ended. The enemy is now using more submarines and long-range aircraft than before, and we expect they will do even more in the future.

US-British Naval Cooperation Transforms the Situation

The United States' actions in the Atlantic are extensive, continuously patrolling the routes to the Western Hemisphere, which is very troublesome for the Germans, who fear a conflict with the powerful American navy. This greatly helps us, and I hope it can be of even greater assistance. However, German strategy may now change. Hitler undoubtedly wants to resolve the British and Soviet issues first and then engage the United States in direct combat. This is his usual strategy of defeating opponents individually. But Hitler also desperately wants to prevent valuable armaments and supplies, which are now flowing across the Atlantic in accordance with US government policy, from reaching Britain. If Hitler really wants to prevent this, then the dangerous zone will spread throughout the Atlantic. We should not engage in empty talk about the Atlantic war already being won. We can be satisfied with all the successes that are the reward for our patience and hard work, but the war is constantly changing and has not yet reached its end.

Inspection of Icelandic Defenses Yields a Good Impression

When I happily returned home after meeting with President Roosevelt, I visited Iceland and received a warm welcome from all levels of Icelandic society and had the opportunity to review the British and American troops. These two countries' troops, for entirely different reasons, are carrying out their respective duties, jointly defending this extremely important island, which could be used by the Nazis as a starting point for aggression across the Atlantic. There are also many British and American naval and air forces stationed on the island and in Newfoundland, which will increasingly play a role in the Atlantic patrols and the continuous nightly flights of large heavy bombers. This kind of work is one of the most decisive factors in the final victory.

British Preemptive Action Stabilizes the Middle East Situation

Our affairs in the Eastern theater are also progressing smoothly. Our relationship with Iraq is governed by a treaty of alliance, which grants us broad powers to protect Iraq and British interests in wartime or other critical times. When the Germans were plotting in Iraq and the pro-German Rashid Ali seized power, we were not unprepared. We had a responsibility to protect transportation within Iraq, so we immediately dispatched a ready-to-respond Indian division to Basra, while Rashid Ali pretended to welcome our troops, hoping we would recognize his regime. Rashid Ali repeatedly asked the Germans to fulfill their promises, but only thirty or forty German aircraft arrived from Syria, intending to station themselves in Baghdad and Mosul. One reason why the Germans could not send more troops to assist Iraq was that the German paratroopers and airborne troops who could have flown to Iraq via Syria to fight had been mostly annihilated in the Battle of Crete. More than ten thousand specially trained German airborne troops were killed in this battle, and many transport aircraft were destroyed. Therefore, although the fierce battle of Crete forced the Allied forces to withdraw, it also caused the Germans to lose their elite forces and prevented them from being used elsewhere. When the new Iraqi government was established, we were able to restore the basis for friendly cooperation. Now both sides are faithfully adhering to the alliance, although there are still dangers in Iraq that require attention, but they have not caused major concerns. (To be continued)

### Iran Fulfills Armistice Conditions, Eradicates Nazi Influence

Reuters, London, 10th: Foreign Secretary Eden today clearly announced in the House of Commons that Britain will not allow any delay in the fulfillment of the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian agreement. In response to questions, the Foreign Secretary said that the Iranian government has accepted the Anglo-Soviet conditions, which stipulate that the German ambassador and his staff must leave Tehran immediately, and the German embassy will be closed, as will the Italian and Hungarian embassies. The Iranian government has announced that it has asked the aforementioned four countries' embassies to comply and has ordered the cessation of coded or wireless communications facilities for the Axis embassies. The Iranian government is now taking steps to transfer German nationals to the British and Soviet governments.

### Battles in Northern Hunan Province Gradually Expanding; Japanese Troops Advance Southeast from Yuezhou; Chinese Elite Troops Launch Attacks on Japanese Rear

Chongqing: According to front-line war reports, the battles in northern Hunan province are gradually expanding due to the successive arrival of Japanese reinforcements. Approximately 15,000 Japanese troops are participating in the fighting. About 9,000 Japanese troops are advancing southeast from Yuezhou, of which 3,000 have reached Mengcheng and Fuzhong (both transliterated). Another column of more than 5,000 troops has departed from Taolin and Xidian (transliterated), heading south towards Qibuling and Zhaoxialing (both transliterated). One contingent of about 2,000 troops is currently attacking Zhanjiaqiao and Lingdian (transliterated). Chinese troops are currently resisting the Japanese advance in both the southeast directions and have dispatched elite troops to attack the Japanese rear. According to Chinese sources in Changde, a Japanese unit is currently advancing north from Liqiaohe (transliterated). (Reuters, 10th)

### Wartime Macau Increasingly Prosperous

Hong Kong: Wartime Macau is becoming increasingly prosperous, ushering in a new era in Macau's history, exceeding the dreams of the people of Macau. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war, wealthy refugees moved to Macau from various parts of South China. Because Portugal maintained neutrality in the European war, Macau benefited greatly in commercial terms. Macau has no military significance, and there are no defenses, so the idle and wealthy classes of Hong Kong have moved to Macau and are spending lavishly. Macau has mountains of goods waiting to be shipped to all parts of the world. Before the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, Axis goods transshipped from Siberia and Shanghai used Macau as a distribution center. Macau has steamships connecting to Saigon, Hanoi, and Guangzhou Bay, and Japanese ships also frequently arrive in Macau. There are also civilian ships connecting to the mainland. In the past, Macau's transportation with the outside world relied entirely on Hong Kong, but now transportation is developed, so business is also booming. Some people are planning to develop Macau into a deep-water port to accommodate the anchorage of ocean-going mail ships. South of Macau are two islands, one is Taipa Island (transliterated) and the other is Coloane Island (transliterated). If the shallow sandy beaches on these two islands are filled in, and then the northern waterway of the two islands is filled in, then the Greater Macau plan can be achieved. Although the cost of this project is very large, the Portuguese authorities have abundant tax revenues, so it is not difficult to raise funds for this construction. If Macau can become a first-class port in the Far East, then the three types of taxes on opium, gambling, and prostitution, which have always been regarded as major sources of revenue, may also be eliminated. The Portuguese government also plans to build a powerful shortwave radio station in Macau to connect with various parts of the Far East and relay messages to various parts of the United States.

### Heavy Rain Causes Disaster in Chongqing; Landslides in Several Parts of the City; Roads Damaged and Houses Collapsed; Bridges Destroyed and Transportation Interrupted

Chongqing: Since Sunday night, heavy rain has been pouring down, almost unprecedented, causing major landslides in several parts of Chongqing, damaging roads, collapsing houses, causing casualties, and starting at least one fire. On Sunday night, Jiang Jieshi's political advisor, Dr. Wilhelm Haas, and Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, narrowly escaped disaster. A huge stone above their residences slid down from the rock and collapsed a house, killing one person and injuring several. The stone stopped only a hundred yards away from the two men's residences. After the landslides, the roads were blocked and impassable. Yesterday, Dr. Haas had to climb over the mountains and rocks and wade through the mud to leave his residence in order to attend Jiang Jieshi's banquet. Many important intersections have large signs warning the public that the bridges and roads ahead have been destroyed and that vehicles cannot pass. (Reuters, 10th)

### Australia Extremely Sympathetic to China; Eggleston Issues Statement; Australian and British Policies Fully Aligned

Singapore: Australia's first Minister to China, Frederic Eggleston, met with reporters this afternoon and said, "I believe that my work in China is just as valuable as the work of Minister Casey in the United States and Minister Latham in Japan. My task is to promote political, cultural, and commercial relations between China and Australia. But I would like to solemnly declare that although Australia has sent ministers abroad, its policies are still consistent with the policies of the British Empire and do not violate the policies of Australia, which closely follows and advances together with the policies of Britain. China is fighting to resist aggression, and Australians have long expressed admiration for China's perseverance and courage. My appointment as minister is an expression of the extreme sympathy and admiration of the Australian people for the Chinese people and for Chairman Jiang Jieshi." Eggleston continued, "He hopes to meet with Xu Mo and Mr. Tev Cooper before going to his post via Yangon." Eggleston visited Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places in 1929. He does not understand Oriental languages but said he is very willing to learn Chinese. Eggleston's hobbies are gardening and collecting works of art. (8th)

### Production Value of Southwest Provinces Increases Sevenfold

Chongqing: According to sources from the Gold Mining Bureau, domestic gold mining organizations have spread throughout the provinces of Sichuan, Kangding, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, and Qinghai. The larger ones are jointly operated by government and merchants, with government loans being used for large-scale mining. The gold obtained is purchased by the national bank. According to the Bureau's estimates, gold production this year can reach seven times that of before the war, valued at more than 50 million yuan at the official price. If traded on the black market, the amount would be even more staggering. Currently, 95% of gold miners still use manual panning. The Gold Mining Bureau is making efforts to encourage the use of machinery. (Havas, 10th)

Chongqing: After important foreign banks in Shanghai stopped the free buying and selling of foreign exchange, officials here generally believe that the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai no longer exists. The Japanese tactic of using legal tender to obtain foreign exchange can no longer be implemented. Legal tender in Shanghai can no longer be easily exchanged for foreign exchange at will, which means that it is possible for us to gradually move it inland. The Economic Committee of the Executive Yuan will invite experts to solicit opinions and study how the government should adopt subtle methods to regulate the movement of legal tender. (Havas, 10th)

### Sichuan Province Efforts to Raise Silkworms; Expected Increase in Raw Silk Production; Nearly 20,000 Market Loads

Chongqing: The US has frozen Japanese funds, affecting the export of Japanese silk to the US. Chinese silk could take the opportunity to regain its position of twenty years ago. However, the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been occupied. Although Sichuan Province also raises silkworms, its production is limited and has always only been used for consumption in the province and is not sufficient for export. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry believes that the opportunity is rare and has specified a plan to open 3,000 mu of mulberry nurseries in Sichuan this year, planting 64.5 million seedlings, increasing the production of original silkworm seeds by 10,000 sheets, and improving 800,000 sheets, with an expected increase in raw silk production of 19,715 market loads. The areas for increased production have also been designated as the five districts of Leshan, Nanchong, Santai, Guanzhong, and Hechuan, which are further divided into 56 guidance areas, each with one director and two to five roving personnel, and each area has one to three instructors to provide practical guidance to silkworm farmers to improve silk production and increase production.

### Gauze Yarn: Whether the Situation Becomes Relaxed or Tense Will Determine Whether the Yarn Market Rises or Falls; The Time for Revelation Is Not Far Off, It Is Best to Observe Quietly

After the yarn market's previous day's sharp rise and subsequent pullback, it continued to weaken yesterday. This was due to the activity of short sellers and the proliferation of rumors, all of which were bearish, causing anxiety among the bulls. However, generally, those with substantial financial resources are not only refusing to cut their losses on large amounts but are instead buying in and increasing their positions when prices are low. The reason for this is that the source of raw cotton is difficult to obtain, and the selling price is high. It is said that the raw material price for spinning 20-count yarn must be sold for 350 to 380 yuan per dan. One bale of cotton yarn requires three and a half dan, plus opening and handling fees of 250 to 300 yuan. Thus, the factory's cost is between 1800 and 1900 yuan. Therefore, those with strong courage are still buying in. However, the views of general speculators are vastly different, saying that as soon as the international situation becomes tense, the market price will fall sharply, and they can then buy in to make a profit. Therefore, short selling has been unusually active in the market recently, causing market volatility. However, apart from speculative purposes, the tightness or relaxation of the Far East situation is the lifeline of yarn market speculation. The next few days are indeed crucial. If the situation actually relaxes, not only can fine-staple American cotton be obtained, but even coarse-staple cotton may be obtainable. Various situations will then undergo a major reversal. If, in the end, a complete breakdown is unavoidable, not only will coarse-staple cotton still be impossible to obtain, but even fine-staple cotton may be blocked by artillery fire. Although the degree may not be so fast, speculators should temporarily observe. As of yesterday, the foundation of the yarn market still seemed stable. The market price of 20-count Double Horse was 1752 yuan, the low price was 1732 yuan, the opening price in the afternoon was 1735 yuan, falling to 1726 yuan. It was heard that the three sessions of the Exchange had recovered, and it subsequently rose to 1739 yuan at the close. The off-exchange price was already 1743 yuan. The Exchange's yarn and cloth fell in the morning and recovered in the afternoon. If the yarn market is solid, people will follow suit, rising and falling without much meaning.

Double Horse opened in the morning due to a lack of confidence, and the first session fell by 10 yuan to 1740 yuan. However, profit-takers bought in, rising to 1751 yuan. Shortly after, the Exchange's opening session trended downward, and confidence greatly eased, reaching 1737 yuan. However, a certain large firm bought in at low prices, and because raw cotton was particularly expensive, buyers still had the courage to buy, rising again to 1744 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 11 o'clock, rumors spread in the market, and short sellers sold, causing the price to weaken again to 1732 yuan. The closing price recovered slightly to 1737 yuan. It is found that the transaction volume for half a day totaled 8635 bales. Today, 580 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 155, Peers 8, 500

Total: 8,655

The Jin Double Horse futures market was volatile. Although it once fell sharply, the opening in the morning, despite the high price of foreign cotton, was met with rumors of eased U.S.-Japan negotiations, causing panic and large fluctuations among longs. Factory orders were the first to decline, and futures yarn initially remained stable, but as the Exchange fell more sharply, the September contract opened at 1650 yuan, reached a high of 1652 yuan, and then fell to a low of 1643 yuan. The October contract opened at 664 yuan and also fell. The November contract also fell from 1678 yuan to 1669 yuan. However, the fluctuations in the middle were due to buyers mainly entering into futures to hedge against spot goods, so the decline was not very large. Therefore, the noon close only fell by about 10 yuan each. In the afternoon, the opening first showed the Exchange continuing to be weak, and factory orders also felt powerless. Sellers of futures yarn were active and continued to decline. Until the close, a sudden rise occurred.

### Exchange Settlements May Have Flexible Measures; The Flourishing Situation of Foreign Cotton Reappears; Special Attention Is Paid to Brazilian Cotton That Has Been Weighed and Is Being Shipped

The Shanghai foreign cotton market is seeing enthusiastic buying interest, and a flourishing situation is showing signs of resurgence. This is because banks have agreed to allow flexible measures for foreign exchange settlements. At the same time, factories believe that the purchase price of existing cotton is too high, and it is much more beneficial to directly order foreign cotton. It is also opportune that foreign cotton companies can have a large batch of Brazilian cotton that will be shipped to Shanghai in the near future, which is an opportunity that the public cannot easily give up. Therefore, the continuous orders from various factories in recent days have made foreign cotton companies overwhelmed. The total transaction volume has reached more than a thousand bales in half a day. It is expected that because the opportunity is rare, later arrivals will be more enthusiastic, and the cotton market will undoubtedly have more smooth progress.

The New York cotton market saw active buying interest and a sharp rise in prices. First, it rose due to buying by peers, and then due to buying on Wall Street and enthusiastic short covering. As a result, the closing price rose again by 11 to 16 points per pound compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market fell due to long liquidation and speculative selling. Closing prices fell by about 1 rupee each. The market situation at the opening today is expected to rise by 2.75 rupees.

Another report: The spot cotton situation remains strong as usual. Because American cotton is rising steadily, and it is not easy to apply for foreign exchange for overseas purchases of raw materials, the rebound in strength is the immediate recovery of the Exchange. The buyers are flocking in, and the spot price has risen sharply by more than 10 yuan. It can be seen that the stability of futures yarn, judging from its trend, is the rise of the Exchange at the close and the recovery of futures yarn, which contains good factors. Therefore, sellers should be cautious about today's continued rise. A table of transaction prices is listed below.

Secondly, due to the lack of ships, most people are bullish. At present, the factories are still holding back a lot. Once they need to move, the market price will rise.

### Piece Goods: South Asian Sales Remain Strong; Lun Chang Cloth Company Sees Huge Gains

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend continued to be firm, but it was once pulled back by the impact of negative rumors. The evening close rebounded again. As a result, sales prices of various cloths were generally stable. Only the British Lun Chang Cloth Company's price rose by 1 yuan per piece. Transactions on this street were limited to about 200 pieces purchased by real sales customers. Sales to customers in South Asia and the Cantonese/Hong Kong groups were relatively strong. In total, there were more than 400 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, and more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth from the Zhejiang East, Wenzhou, and Yongzhou groups.

Eastern Cloth: The Exchange crashed, followed by a rise. Closing prices for each month fell by 1 jiao to 4.5 jiao. The current leading fine cloth fell by 3.5 jiao, medium-grade fine cloth twill fell by 1-2 jiao, and Sijunzi woolen cloth fell by 5 ya to 1 fen. The closing price for new orders with new taxes was 2 yuan and 2.8 jiao. Ito and other foreign firms bought more than 300 pieces of woolen cloth and various local fine cloth twills in the afternoon. Dyeing factories also purchased more than 200 pieces.

Exports: Today, there were 870 pieces of cotton cloth shipped to Hong Kong and 55 pieces shipped to Kalga.

### Securities: Signs of Disaffection from Fu; Strong Attraction of Domestic and Foreign Securities; Categories B, C, D, Geng, and Wu All Rose by More Than 1 Yuan; Famous Foreign Stocks Also Reached New Highs

Public bonds in the gray market yesterday showed that there was a symbol of Japan's exit from the Axis powers. It was speculated that the US-Japan talks must also be close, and that there is hope for peace in China and Japan. Because of this centrifugal force, it became the attraction of domestic bonds. The market sentiment was greatly excited. With continuous absorption, Category C broke through the 72 yuan mark, and Category E also reached over 70 yuan. Even Category B, which had just been drawn, was still within 3 yuan the day before yesterday and is now over 4 yuan. The excellent market price is a new high price after interest payment. The future has progress and no retreat, but a reversal of the wind is inevitable. Yesterday morning, Yi Chang, De Long, Hong Da, Run De, Jiu Cheng, Xie and Yuan all sold one after another. The noon close was 3-5 jiao better. In the afternoon, Hong Da and Run De continued to buy. Da Hua, Yong Kang, Da Zhong, and Ding Kang either added to their long positions or covered their short positions. Yi Tai and Lian Yi continued to sell. Tong Kang and Tong Shun slightly sold off. Xie Xing and Yuan Deli settled out. For a time, the market was high. After the interest payment, it was never seen. As a result, the market price rose by 7 jiao to 1.4 yuan across the board. The total transaction volume for the whole day was about 2 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 550 shares of ABC Innerwear Company were traded at a price of 12.5 yuan.

Also, the stock market of the Public Chamber of Commerce continued to rise, and prices were exceptionally firm. Many famous stocks reached new high prices. Rubber stocks were also very prosperous. The most rising stocks were Yingda, Qu Ying Zha Hua, Lang Gezhi and Rubber, etc.

### Finance: Hong Kong Electricity Continues to Fall; Spot Price Enters the 9,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's gold market saw the October futures continue to trend flat, only 8 yuan high or low, and finally continue to fall by a small 5 yuan, with 7-800 liang traded. The spot opening was still above 1,000 liang. Because it is spot trading, the supply and demand chips are slightly unbalanced, and huge waves are easy to rise. However, a fierce decline unfolded, and the price has broken into the 9,000 yuan mark. It is said that the US-Japan talks have caused a certain atmosphere between China and Japan. It is also heard that the gold price in Hong Kong continues to fall. Local Hong Kong, Tianjin, Chaozhou and other customer groups are selling out. The sentiments of all parties are even more weak and difficult to revive. Starting in the morning, Chengji sold 10 liang to Xianghe first, for 9,150 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan. It continued to decline. Yutaiyan sold 10 liang to Xianghe for 9,100 yuan, and another 10 liang, and Chengji sold 20 liang, Lianyu bought in for 9,060 yuan, Chengji sold 30 liang to Xianghe, and Wanfeng 10 liang, 9,005 yuan. At the same price, Xianghe bought another 20 liang from Tianyuan. Then the sellers waited and saw a rebound immediately. Xianghe bought 50 liang each from Yutai Feng for 9,060 yuan, and another 50 liang each from Dafeng and Defu for 9,100 yuan, and another 50 liang from Defu for 9,110 yuan. The Hong Kong and Chaozhou gangs sold out, and the upward trend stabilized. Defu sold 50 liang to Xianghe and 10 liang to Tianyuan for 9,100 yuan. Yongcheng sold 10 liang for 9,090 yuan. Defu sold 20 liang for 9,100 yuan, all bought by Xianghe. Defu sold 6 and 10 liang to Xinyuan, and Chi Da 20 liang for 9,080 yuan. Xinyuan resold 10 liang to Chengda. Defu sold 60 liang to Xianghe, and Mingyan sold 50 liang to Xianghe, all for 9,090 yuan. Defu resold 10 liang to Xianghe for 9,080 yuan. Bang Yifeng sold 50 liang to Shihe for 9,050 yuan. Defu resold 10 liang to Tianyuan at the same price, and another 20 liang for 9,030 yuan. Defu bought in and continued to sell to Tianyuan 10 liang for 9,010 yuan. Chengda sold 10 liang to Tianyuan for 9,000 yuan. Decheng asked for sale, and immediately stepped down another 80 yuan before selling 10 liang each to Tianyuan and Xiang Xing Yong, down to 8,920 yuan. At 11:50, suddenly saw Xianghe come to buy in Fuka Yong 10 liang for 8,930 yuan. Later, there were fewer sellers, so it was raised by 170 yuan in 2 minutes before continuing to buy in 20 liang from Chengji for 9,100 yuan, and then 50 liang from Yongcheng and 30 liang from a certain gold shop for 9,120 yuan. Defu sold at a limited price. Xianghe's purchase was full, so it was shouted down to 9,000 yuan again in 1 minute, and finally saw Tianyuan sell 10 liang to Shihe for 8,980 yuan, 200 yuan less than the daily squeeze, with 230 yuan high or low. The market price of the gold shop's own brand gold was 9,050 yuan, and the purchase was reduced by 200 yuan. The price of decorative gold was also 20 yuan lower, for 920 yuan.

Futures Can't Bear to Look Back

The opening price for the October gold contract (10 liang) at 9:15 was 6,865 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan. Heshneg first asked to sell, bought in by Tianyuan 30 liang, and then by Yifeng and Decheng, so from 6,862 yuan, gradually rose to 6,870 yuan. Defu sold out, and it lost to 6,865 yuan. The noon closing was 6,870 yuan, a decrease of 5 yuan from the previous day. The difference on that day was only 8 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Decorative Gold Fell by Two Small Increments

The exchange price of silver shop decorative gold per liang, Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, fell by 10 yuan at 10 o'clock in the morning, and then by another 10 yuan at 11:30, falling back to 920 yuan (purchase reduced by 50 yuan), a decrease of 20 yuan.

### Black Market Is Quiet; Let's See How the Bulls and Bears Settle

The foreign exchange market yesterday, the Central Bank and HSBC's listed prices and the HSBC small rights counter price were fixed. The black market for British and American exchange rates has been difficult to develop. The market price of 2.859275 for British exchange and 4.84375 for American exchange has gradually become quiet. The reporter inquired in many ways. At present, Chinese speculators have a net long of less than 1 million US dollars, with 1.2-3 million US dollars long in September contracts and 3-400,000 US dollars short. What price will this transaction be settled at? It is not known whether the Stabilization Fund has discussed this. If it is settled at the price of 5.4375 sold by exporters to the 14 local banks, it will cause huge losses to speculators. If it is settled at the transaction price at that time (around 5 yuan), the banks are afraid it will be difficult to allow it. Therefore, it depends on whether the black market will exist in the future, or whether it will be settled at a price set by the Hong Kong Stabilization Fund.

### Grains: Although Rice Merchants Will Use False Excuses, They Will Ultimately Be No Match for the General Trend; Yesterday's Market Price Has Already Seen a Small Recovery

The foreign rice market has turned into a volatile situation with many changes. Because of the sudden surge in foreign exchange and other issues in the previous dynasty, yesterday's market saw a decline again. The market fell sharply by 3-4 yuan in the morning. The reason for this is nothing more than the thick reserves and people's fear. Therefore, once the price is raised, the real sales stagnate again. At the same time, general profit-takers take advantage of the high prices and emerge. Skin ball business is also fading. Therefore, the market lacks a foundation and is often shaky. At the beginning of the morning market, in the absence of inquiries, the shouting price was low. The small grain of the Bank Zhan was the most tired, opening only 109 yuan. Then there were more and more chips, and the market shape became more and more tired. If the small grain of the Bank Zhan fell to 107 yuan, the outer Zhan fell to 106 yuan, and the tired wind was even stronger before the evening market. There was a shouting price of 104.5 yuan, which was 12-13 yuan lower than the official selling price of 117 yuan in the market. Therefore, some rice shops in the market have automatically reduced to 108-9 yuan. Other goods have been devalued one after another. Thus, all the way down, until the close of the market, a wind of replenishment suddenly rose, and the recovery was slightly tighter, and the recovery was 1-2 yuan, but it was still 2-3 yuan lower than the previous market. The closing price of Saigon No. 1 was 121.5 yuan to 120 yuan, No. 2 was 111 yuan to 110 yuan, Siam Transport No. 1 was 119 yuan, Siam Er No. 2 was 105 yuan to 103 yuan, He Fojian was 115 yuan, Huojiao was 116 yuan, Mindangjue was 111 yuan to 110 yuan, Yin Zhan Xiaojiao was 108 yuan, Outer Zhan was 107 yuan, Broken Jian was 82.5 yuan to 80 yuan, and Yinghua Si Xiaojiao was also in the process of stepping down. The spot goods opened yesterday at 135 yuan, and the road goods were as small as 133.5 yuan, Siam Transport No. 2 was 128 yuan, and Broken Rice was initially opened at 94 yuan, and then from 93.5 yuan to 92.8 yuan, with a transaction of more than 700 tons. Direct transactions in the afternoon were also suppressed by 1-2 yuan. The total number of spot rice transactions for the whole day was more than 10,000 bags.

Due to the slightly larger amount of arrival, the thick and thin Japonica rice market was affected by the foreign rice, resulting in a sluggish sales and loose sales, and the selling price fell by more than 2 yuan. The opening price of Nanhai early indica rice was 150 yuan, and it was reduced to 148 yuan. Wuxi Gaojing was about 150 yuan, Pudong New Jing high goods was 152 yuan, and the general market was 150 yuan.

Glutinous rice alone continued to be beautiful by 1-2 yuan due to the scarcity and fragrant taste. The opening price of Hong Kong Baiyuan was as high as 127 yuan, and the second was 123-4 yuan, and the glutinous tea was mediocre, still at 113 yuan, reduced to 110 yuan.

### Foreign Vermicelli Foreign Exchange Settlement Is Not Yet Ready

The vermicelli market was stimulated by the crazy drop in foreign rice and rumors. The market was tired and weak, and the selling atmosphere was very strong. It seemed to be following the failure of foreign rice. However, in the current Mid-Autumn Festival Mooncake season, the daily real sales of local customers often reached 13-4,000 bags. In addition, the customer's skin ball had 2-30,000 bags of transactions per day. Although foreign wheat can be settled in foreign exchange, the foreign exchange settlement of foreign vermicelli has not yet been completed. Therefore, the market has been fluctuating and hovering in recent days. The market price has always been hovering outside 30 yuan for several weeks, and has not been able to fall directly like foreign rice. However, yesterday's market finally saw a sharp drop of about 5-8 jiao due to the timid sentiment and the sale of large accounts, but it was still raised by the customer's low-price replenishment in the middle, and the closing price was restored. The opening price of Jinlong West Zhan in the morning was 30.06 jiao, up to 31.05 yuan, and the afternoon closing fork recovered by a small 2-3 jiao. In the afternoon, floating highs and big buyers competed to sell down to 30.025 jiao. Before the evening closing, the former goods were shouted higher again, Jinlong East Zhan 31.4 yuan, 31 yuan in the afternoon, Cannon 32.4 jiao, Banana 32.2 jiao, Five Swallow 31.6 jiao, local flour stock and production are both dry, still standing at about 34 yuan.

### Oil Market: The Decline in Edible Oil Is Getting Worse

Yesterday, the decline in edible oil became more widespread. Raw soybean oil has been arriving in Shanghai one after another. Another 4,000 barrels and 16,000 cans have arrived and been imported. Driven by the rumored selling trend, the sentiment became more weak, and all parties started to depreciate and sell. As a result, the market fell sharply. Rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil fell by 8-9 yuan more than before. Tongshi sold more than 7,000 dan of Xiajiao Qing oil from Daguo Factory in September. The opening price was 173 yuan, the highest was 173.5 yuan, the lowest was 162 yuan, and the closing price was 163.5 yuan. Also, the opening price of Caiyou from Rihua Factory was 169 yuan, the highest was 171.5 yuan, the lowest was 161.5 yuan, and the closing price was 163.5 yuan. Spot goods were rarely favored, only sporadic openings.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Exchange Can Be Supplied; Sugar Prices Fall Back

Yesterday, because foreign exchange could be supplied in the sugar market, the sentiment weakened and the price turned loose. The spot goods from the Guild's Liu Pan, the import of 24 rough white in August, was 133.3 yuan to 35 yuan, in July 132.5 yuan-34.5 yuan-32 yuan to 34 yuan, small two yuan, Dutch red spot was 122 yuan, the same degree of decline. Taikoo's carriage white B mark was 162 yuan, HX mark was 143.5 yuan, small two yuan to one and a half yuan, H mark carriage red was 113 yuan, 15 yuan, 17 yuan, the company's futures contract for the delivery of 24 rough white on September 20 was 134.5 yuan, small to 31.2 jiao, and then recovered to 33 yuan to 33.4 jiao, a small 1.2 yuan, the 30-day period was 134 yuan, 33.1 jiao-16.5 yuan-35.4 jiao, a total of more than 31,000 bags of futures were traded, and more than 3,000 bags of spot goods were traded.

### North-South Goods: New Stone Wharf Circle Has Not Yet Formed

The new goods of Guilin cinnamon have been reported to be in short supply this year, and the production price is exceptionally high. This is worth the stage. The first batch of five boxes has been shipped to Shen for testing. Yesterday, the goods were sampled. The quality of the goods is still good. Although the lines reluctantly picked up the price due to the small quantity, it is still difficult to reach the cost. As a result, no transaction was made. From the perspective of the towel market, the price is already high. If it is raised to the peak again, it is feared that it will not be very suitable.

### Sino-Japanese Joint Agricultural Bank to Handle Foreign Exchange and Export Settlement Matters Following Order; Crossover of Two Banks Responsible for Operations

Hawkins and Mackay Return to Shanghai Yesterday with Detailed Instructions

Following the fourteen allied banks, the Shanghai Sino-Japanese Joint Agricultural Bank officially received an order from the Stabilization Board yesterday to handle foreign exchange applications and export settlement matters for customers. All foreign exchange businesses of the four banks will be centralized and handled by the Sino-Japanese Joint Bank. The scope of its operations includes the import of foreign exchange for goods approved by the Stabilization Board, small-scale import trade, and foreign exchange supply for a small number of individuals. The Sino-Japanese Joint Bank can also handle the settlement and sale of export drafts. Furthermore, to facilitate the Stabilization Board's understanding of the actual situation, the two banks must regularly report the settlement status to the board. Chinese-owned banks such as Dalu, Zhongnan, Kenye, Xingye, Jincheng, Shanghai, Overseas Chinese, Dongya, Zhongxing, Xinhua, and Siming have already reached agreements with the Sino-Japanese Joint Bank. When importers request foreign exchange, the banks will transfer the request to the Sino-Japanese Joint Bank for approval from the Stabilization Board. However, the original handling bank must bear full responsibility for the approved foreign exchange.

Hawkins, etc., Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

Mr. Hawkins, General Manager of the Mercantile Bank, and Mr. Mackay, Supervisor of the National City Bank of the United States, who were summoned from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 29th of last month to participate in a Stabilization Board meeting to discuss methods for supplying foreign exchange for essential goods, have returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:30 pm aboard the American liner President Cleveland, having completed their work in Hong Kong.

### Two French Warships Suddenly Entered Port, Sailed from the Yangtze River to Shanghai for Repairs at the Jiangnan Shipyard

After the expansion of the European War, the French warships stationed in China, except for one shallow-water gunboat remaining in this city, all sailed to Vietnam. Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 pm, two French warships were suddenly seen arriving at the port. The ship names were Fr.G.B.Beryl and Fr.G.B.Valeureux. They sailed directly to the Gaochangmiao waterfront on the southern Huangpu River and anchored. It is said that the two ships came to Shanghai from the Yangtze River. They are small in tonnage, the hulls are old, and the gun positions have also been removed. Generally, due to years of disrepair, they sailed to Shanghai to be repaired in the docks of the French-owned Jiangnan Shipyard.

### Vietnamese Troops Take Over

Recently, there has been a partial movement of the French Defense Forces stationed in Shanghai. Two hundred and seventy-four soldiers from French-owned Vietnam arrived in Shanghai last Monday aboard the Bena Saint Pierre of the French Post Boat Company to replace the Vietnamese soldiers who are about to leave Shanghai and be transferred to Vietnam. They are now stationed in the French Defense Forces barracks on Avenue Albert and other locations. Officials from the French Consulate General in Shanghai have externally stated that this batch of Vietnamese soldiers came to strengthen the defense within the French Concession, which is not our understanding. They claim that this is merely an ordinary transfer of personnel.

### Tai Tuo Pang's Trial Continued Yesterday, Sentencing Set for the 12th; Interrogation of Impersonating Fingerprints, Concealing the Truth; Multiple Evidence Presented in the Case of Stealing and Selling Public Property

The English-language "China Press" reports that Mr. Ludun, Special Commissioner of the U.S. Court for China, opened court today (the 10th) to continue the trial of Tai Tuo Pang, former Deputy Executive Officer of the Commissioner's Office, for stealing and selling public property. Three witnesses testified that the defendant had debts at several hotels and nightclubs.

Concealing the Truth

After the questioning, the Commissioner set the sentencing for the 12th of this month, and then continued the trial on the charge of impersonating another person's fingerprints on the resume submitted by the defendant to the U.S. Department of Justice, concealing the truth. The witnesses who testified in court today were one employee each from the Fa Lansi Nightclub, the International Hotel, and the Dids Cafe, stating that the defendant owed debts ranging from over two hundred yuan to over one thousand yuan.

Shaking Head to Signal

When the defendant's lawyer, Wu Lushi, wanted to question the witnesses, Tai Tuo Pang shook his head to signal him to stop. Then, Prosecutor Hill of the Commissioner's Office summarized the process of the defendant stealing and selling government-owned pistols and ammunition, and presented multiple pieces of evidence. His conclusion was that the defendant was heavily in debt due to his fondness for nightlife, and therefore resorted to this.

Appearing Quite Uneasy

When the prosecutor was narrating eloquently, Tai Tuo Pang looked at him intently, appearing quite uneasy, his lips moving as if he wanted to respond. Ultimately, the defendant's lawyer spoke, making some arguments regarding the defendant's debts and Luo Senpang's handling of the sale of firearms. The Commissioner then announced a recess to continue studying the case and set the sentencing for the 12th.

### Gasoline and Oils Arriving as Usual; More Detailed Reports on Supply Situation Expected Next Week

The supply of gasoline and oils in Shanghai is expected to continue to arrive as usual. According to the head of an American oil company in this city this morning (the 10th), more detailed news about this matter can be obtained next week, at which time the situation of the oil supply in Shanghai will be clarified. Rumors that gasoline and fuel oil may be in short supply have spread throughout the city. In fact, some people are hoarding oil to profit. Therefore, each oil company has implemented new restrictions starting this month to prevent gasoline from being hoarded or prices from soaring. Currently, Shanghai is continuously receiving a normal supply of gasoline and oils, and it is expected that they will continue to arrive in the future. Although each oil company has implemented restrictions to prevent hoarding, it does not intend to sell gasoline by the carload.

### Italian Ship Steward Seriously Injured in Beating

An Italian man, Rafael, 35 years old, serves as a steward on the Italian post boat Conte Verde. The ship came to Shanghai a few days ago. Rafael disembarked the ship the night before last and spent the night playing in a dance hall. At 7:00 am yesterday, he was returning home when he was suddenly stopped by six white-skinned teenagers near the Tilanqiao neighborhood in Hongkou. They held sticks and other objects and violently beat Rafael. As a result, he was struck in the head and seriously injured, collapsing in a pool of blood. The perpetrators fled in all directions upon seeing this. A patrolman discovered him, summoned a car, and sent him to the Gōngjì Hospital for treatment. He is also investigating the circumstances of the incident.

### Japanese Detective Yamaguchi Dies of Serious Injuries; Said to Have Made Enemies While Handling Cases; Accomplices Ambush for Revenge

The English-language China Press reports that Yamaguchi Muneyo, a Japanese detective from the Public Concession Police Department, was ambushed on the morning of the 9th at the corner of Gordon Road and Penang Road, sustaining three gunshot wounds. He was rushed to Fumin Hospital, where two bullets were removed. One bullet, however, had penetrated his spine and could not be removed. He succumbed to his injuries at 6:30 am on the 10th. His wife was by his side, and he left behind a daughter who is only three years old. Yamaguchi's body has been moved to the Honganji Temple on Zhapu Road for a memorial service.

The Continental Daily News also reports that, according to officials from the Police Department, Yamaguchi was 34 years old and had been working for the Police Department for 13 years. He had just been transferred from the Central Precinct to the Gordon Road Precinct eleven days ago. This assassination is believed to be due to Yamaguchi making enemies while handling a certain case in the past. The assassin was attempting to avenge him for his accomplices. According to the police officers investigating this case, this is the only motive for the shooting, as Yamaguchi has no connection to politics.

### Shanghai Food Cooperative Association Resolves to Temporarily Cease Operations; Dissenting Members Account for Less Than Two Percent

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Food Cooperative Association has assisted the general public in handling small-amount fixed-price rice, achieving remarkable results. Now, the association believes that the current Shanghai rice problem has been resolved, and it seems unnecessary for the association to continue operations. Therefore, it was resolved at the eighth board meeting to temporarily cease operations, return the funds according to regulations, and solicit opinions from all members. If there are any objections, please submit them in writing within one week. If the written objections received do not account for two-tenths of the total membership, the board of directors will handle the cessation of operations. Now that the deadline has passed, only six people have raised objections. Considering that there are 336 current members, this accounts for less than two percent. It was resolved at the ninth board meeting to proceed with the temporary cessation of operations. Once the procedures are completed, the funds will be returned according to regulations. If there is a need for service in the future, it can be carried out again based on past experience.

These ships originally sailing to Fuzhou ceased operations after the Japanese army landed on the coast of Fujian Province and occupied Fuzhou in April. The date of resumption of shipping is not yet known, but it is believed that several of them are currently preparing to sail within a few days. There have already been inquiries about transporting goods from Shanghai to Fuzhou and various ports in Fujian Province, but the freight rates will be greatly increased, estimated at around 2,500 yuan per ton, which is more than

double the previous rate.

According to the Maritime Bureau, certain goods are expected to be allowed to be transported to Zhejiang, but their details are not known.

### Wu Zhesheng Kidnapping Case; Police Arrest Driver Who Used to Drive for Ding Xishan's Japanese Advisor; Jointly Arrested with Japanese and Detained for Investigation

Wu Zhesheng, General Manager of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, was kidnapped on the 7th of this month at 7:15 am from his residence at No. 11, Hua'an Lane, No. 1088, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, by more than ten kidnappers in two cars with black license plates No. 2235 and No. 3724, who broke into Wu's bedroom and kidnapped Wu. To this day, there is no news. The car used by the kidnappers, No. 2235, was discovered at around 10:30 am on the same morning at the intersection of No. 1626, Jing'an Temple Road, Public Concession. The responsible police station, considering that the incident occurred in the French Concession, notified the French police station to drive the car back for investigation. It is now learned that the French police station, based on the origin of the car, arrested a suspect in the kidnapping case. The process of solving the case is as follows: after discovering the car, the French police investigated and found that the car, No. 2235, belonged to Todo, the Japanese advisor in Ding Xishan's army stationed in Beiqiao, and was usually driven by the driver Yan Fulai (from Ningbo, 45 years old). The French police, together with the Japanese, went to Beiqiao according to the address and arrested the driver Yan Fulai. Jin Zhihe, the factory doctor of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory who witnessed the incident at the scene, went to the police station to identify him. It was confirmed that Yan Fulai was driving the car at the scene when Wu was kidnapped, making Yan a major suspect. However, when the French police interrogated Yan, he claimed that he had joined Ding Xishan's army last November to drive for Todo, but he absolutely denied being involved in the kidnapping case. He claimed that he had gotten up on that morning, gone to a teahouse for tea, and returned after breakfast, still seeing the car parked in the garage at more than 7 o'clock. As for how the car was stolen later, he did not know. Although the car's engine key was on him, perhaps others could also make a copy, and so on. The French police, considering the seriousness of the case, have now detained Yan at the police station to await a thorough investigation.

### Further Arrests Made in the Case of Shooting a Gambling Den Shareholder; Three Criminals Confess Without Regret

Zhang Kangmei, a shareholder of the Yongyuan gambling den at No. 121, Lane 1912, Zhuanbang, Jing'an Temple Road, who lived at No. 6, Le'an Lane, Jessfield Road, was shot and assassinated at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Difeng Road on July 28, 1939, due to a gambling den dispute. The police station had previously arrested the criminals Mao Xiangyun and Wang Shouzhang and sent them to the First Special Court, where Mao was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and Wang to life imprisonment. An arrest warrant was issued to arrest the accomplices Liu Jincheng and others who were still at large for strict handling of the case. Two years later, the Chinese detective Li Yinmin and Chen Jinsheng from the New Gate Police Station learned that Liu Jincheng, also known as Da Maotou, was hiding in Room 311 of the New World Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. They secretly went and arrested Liu, along with his accomplices Yin Jiajia from Jiangyin, Pu Jieshang and Zhang Zhensheng from Baoshan, Zhou Tiebao from Jiangbei, and Gao Linbao from Haimen, totaling six people, who were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested a postponement. When questioned, Liu Jincheng confessed that this case was discussed in the French Park beforehand, deciding to assassinate Zhang Kangmei. At that time, Wang Shouzhang and Zhou Tiebao each held a pistol, and he fired the shots, killing Zhang. Zhou Tiebao confessed that Zhang Kangmei had a feud with the shareholder Wang Shouzhang, so he went and shot Zhang. He was only watching the scene at the time and did not hold a gun. Judge Shi instructed the defendants to be detained to await rescheduling and review.

### Divorce of Elderly Couple, Daughter's Suicide, Continued Inquiry

The news item "Elderly Couple Divorces, Daughter Commits Suicide" published on the 9th of this month contains some inaccuracies. According to letters from Zhao Jingzhai and his divorced wife Ding, as well as the owner of Mintian Rice Store Tang Huaxing, the true facts are supplemented as follows: (1) Zhao Jingzhai and his wife Ding signed a divorce agreement on the 6th without any conditions and without any loss of 1,000 yuan in compensation. (2) Ding is a doctor who "serves in the hospital and does not return day or night, only returning home to collect clothes and to diagnose illnesses with the owner of Mintian Store, with evidence such as fever records and prescriptions." "Master Tang has been ill for a long time, and Ding was treating him. Because the air in his room was not very sufficient, he ordered Biyu's room and Master Tang's room to be temporarily exchanged." There was no adultery, and there were no major disputes between the couple that led to the split. (3) When the daughter, Biyu, was packing her clothes, she found the divorce agreement in the closet. Upon seeing it, she felt ashamed and indignant, and committed suicide by taking poison. It was not due to the mother and daughter breaking up due to the daughter regretting the agreement. According to Ding's letter, her daughter committed suicide because she failed her academic grades, leading to a short-sighted act of taking poison.

It is now heard that the Municipal Council plans to further increase the license fees by 50% to 115% starting this month, causing panic among tens of thousands of stallholders in the French Concession.

According to the English-language North China Daily News, it is reported that the two Soviet ships, including the Kovda, which arrived in Shanghai in mid-March this year for repairs in dry dock, have been modified to accommodate more cargo.

The modifications have now been completed, and the ships will leave port early next week, possibly heading to Thailand and Manila to load relief supplies. It is expected that after arriving in Thailand, these two ships will load strategic raw materials in accordance with the commercial treaty signed between the Soviet Union and Thailand in April. In Manila, they may load a large number of machine parts and metals that were held up in Manila two years ago due to the American embargo on the Soviet Union. Now that the American embargo on the Soviet Union has been lifted,

their export is permitted. It is also reported that another Soviet ship, the Food Industry, which is currently being repaired in Shanghai, was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai last week, but due to the need for further repairs, it is still in dry dock and will leave port in three months. According to reports this morning (10th), two more Soviet ships are expected to arrive here within the next ten days for

repairs and refurbishment.

However, the names of these two ships are not yet known. In addition, Su Levichu, the manager of the Soviet shipping company Hongyun Navigation Bureau in this city, fell from a gangplank while inspecting the departure of the repaired Soviet ship Gorky at the Yangshupu Shipyard last week, fracturing his left foot. He is still being treated at Hong En Hospital, and doctors believe that Su's left foot may need to be amputated.

Mr. Yang of Qihoutang had previously donated one hundred yuan. Today, Mr. Yang's respected father, moved by the article "An Anonymous Elder Encourages Students" (original text can be found in the "Chunqiu" column of this newspaper on the 8th), donated another 500 yuan, which is deeply appreciated. The Xinya Bookstore on Henan Road has decided to recommend several staff trainees to this newspaper to apply for further studies.

Qihoutang Yang

To the Editor: I have been studying for eight years without making any progress. Having read the article on student aid funds in your newspaper, I was deeply moved. I think of my fellow youth who, with the protection of their fathers and brothers, can study with peace of mind, while other students are trapped by their environment and unable to fulfill their wishes. I reported this to my father and wanted to contribute a small amount to help, so I asked him to allocate 100 yuan from the funds given by my late grandmother, receipt number 394 on August 4th, to do my part. This morning, my father read the article by the anonymous elder in your newspaper, and his encouragement to the students in the last paragraph was profound and far-reaching. If they can act accordingly, then benefiting the community will be limitless. He immediately handed over 500 yuan to be sent to you and asked that it be included under the student aid fund and a receipt issued (Qihoutang Yang), I would be fortunate. Yang Zhuodun bowed on September 8th.

Xinya Bookstore

To the Editor: This time, your office has gone to great lengths to organize a student aid fund for bookstore employees, benefiting the employees and students, which is truly significant. The enthusiasm of your colleagues is also commendable. We now present 100 yuan, hoping that it will be included in the next student aid fund. The amount is small, but it is a small gesture to respond to your righteous act and express our feelings. This is addressed to the Shen Bao. Sincerely, Xinya Bookstore.

An Junjing Raised Funds

To the Editor: The student aid fund organized by your newspaper benefits the poor, which is truly significant. We wholeheartedly express our support. We are now sending all the funds raised to the best of our ability, in order to contribute to the cause and provide a small benefit to children who have lost the opportunity to study. A total of 1,757 yuan. An Ji of Zheng Guanghe Company, No. 44 Fuzhou Road, bowed.

Congratulatory Gift for Student Aid

To the Editor: My second son, Zeyi, has reached his full month. I received congratulatory gifts from friends. In this time of national crisis and economic hardship, I dare not do anything, so I declined all of them. However, some congratulatory gifts were firmly refused. I estimate that there are more than 200 yuan. I am now aware that your newspaper is organizing a student aid fund for the poor, benefiting young people and cultivating the foundation of the nation, which I greatly admire. Therefore, I specially collected 300 yuan and sent it to people to benefit friends and express my small intention to support. Jiang Guozhang bowed, September 4, 30th year.

### Ministry Order for the National Southwestern Associated University Teachers College to Add Two Junior Classes

(Kunming News) The National Southwestern Associated University and the Provincial Department of Education recently received an order from the Ministry of Education to issue regulations for the establishment of junior classes in the Teachers College, in order to cultivate teachers for junior high schools and simplified normal schools in various provinces.

### International Lober Cup Doubles: China vs. Portugal in Today's Final; At 1:00 PM This Afternoon, Wu-Li vs. Ke-Ma; China Defeated the United States in Straight Sets Yesterday

In this year's International Lober Cup Doubles Championship, the preliminary match between China and the United States, originally scheduled for the day before yesterday, was delayed due to rain. It was temporarily decided to hold a makeup match at the Association Stadium at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Few people knew about it beforehand. In yesterday's match, China was represented by Wang Wenzheng and Li Guofan, while the United States was represented by Shi Guiya and Robert Chi. Wang and Li have strong strength and tacit cooperation. In contrast, Shi Guiya's sharpness has diminished since losing Carson's assistance, and although Mr. Lao is a veteran of twenty years ago, he is already old and fading. Without even making contact, the outcome was already decided. In yesterday's match, China swept away the United States in a one-sided situation, advancing to the second round of the week. The entire match took only more than 30 minutes. There were a total of six sliding games. China won five, and the United States won only one. In addition, the second round match between China and Portugal is scheduled to be held at the same location at 5:00 PM this afternoon. China will still be represented by Wang and Li. The Portuguese team is likely to be represented by Kela Shamasanaer, and victory is within reach.

### My Child

— Hui

We've been married for five years and now have two and a half children. The older one, a boy, is four, the younger one, a girl, is two, and the half one will be born soon. Normally, with a spacious house, taking care of a few children wouldn't be a problem, but now it's extremely difficult. When trying to rent a house, we always run into the "no children allowed" sign. Luckily, we rented the house before having children, so the landlord is too embarrassed to ask us to leave. However, in such a small room, it's hard to find a good place for the children. If they're on the street, there's the danger of getting lost or being hit by a vehicle; if they're at home, they'll either tear up letters or step into the spittoon, and they're always getting into trouble. But I feel bad if I tell them to stay still.

Children are great imitators. They watch every word and action of adults and imitate them when they have the chance. For example, many people in my house play mahjong, so when they get a stamp or something that looks like a bamboo tile, they throw it down with their little hands and shout "Pong!" The older child heard some vulgar curses on the street, and when he got home, he started cursing his dad. It shows that a child's character is influenced by the environment at least as much as by education.

Children's interests are completely different from adults'. They are most interested in small animals like dogs and cats and things that move. Adults may not be as interested in these things, so it's foolish for adults to force their children to like what they like. Children also have their own special understanding of everything. Once, the older child saw his dad's tie and said, "That's Daddy's tail," because he saw that cats and dogs have tails, so he thought that the thing Daddy was dragging around must also be a tail. Another time, when the younger child had just woken up and opened her eyes, the older child said, "Sister's eyes are awake." This kind of understanding is sometimes wrong, but sometimes even more correct than adults'. When they ask questions because they can't understand something, it's the best opportunity for education.

The most common way to stop children from making mistakes is to hit them, but this method is mostly only effective for a short time. After being beaten and crying, children often don't understand the reason for the beating, and instead focus on how to avoid being beaten, sometimes even treating the beating as a duty. Once, some children were putting the juice of a wild grass on their hands, saying that applying this would make their palms not hurt when they were hit. It shows that the effect of hitting is very subtle.

I think the best way to correct children's mistakes is to encourage them, using their most familiar playmates as examples. For example, if a child steals something to eat, you can tell him that a certain child doesn't steal and that another child got sick from eating too much. If you tell him these facts over and over again, he will naturally feel that he shouldn't do it and correct his behavior in the future. Human beings have an inherent tendency towards goodness and progress. Actively guiding them in this direction is more effective than passively punishing them afterwards. Many children who are used to being beaten develop a kind of slavishness.

I think the most worrying thing for parents is that schools and society are too separated. The attitude towards life that children learn in school is not only different from what they see outside the school gates, or even after school, but often the exact opposite. This has a huge impact on their weak minds. They will also become very obedient, very hypocritical, and have two-faced personalities. What will become of the next generation of citizens?

Common Knowledge

### Questions and Answers

— Hu Keli

(1) Does hot water freeze more easily than cold water?

Answer: No, cold water always freezes more easily than hot water. However, boiled cold water freezes more easily than water from the tap because boiling the water drives out some of the air bubbles it contains.

(2) What are the chances of a pregnant woman having twins?

Answer: Once in every eighty-seven deliveries.

(3) How can flies hang upside down on the ceiling?

Answer: The membranous fleshy pads on the fly's feet secrete a small amount of a sticky liquid, which allows it to adhere to the ceiling.

(4) Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?

Answer: Conventionally speaking, a tomato is a vegetable. But from a horticultural point of view, a tomato should be a fruit because it belongs to the soft-fleshed fruit category.

(5) Why can fear turn a person's face pale?

Answer: Fear stimulates the adrenal glands, causing them to pour out excessive secretions. This excessive secretion constricts the blood vessels on the surface of various parts of the body, so the blood on the surface of the skin is squeezed out, resulting in a sparse state. Extreme anger can also cause the same reaction.

(6) In a race between a human and a horse, who is faster?

Answer: For short distances, the horse is faster; for long distances (referring to consecutive races lasting several days), the human is faster.

A Brief Talk

### A Simple Hope

— Jiang Hong

The mother of American President Roosevelt has passed away. The exemplary words and deeds of the mother of this pillar of a democratic country are certainly worthy of our attention.

According to Roosevelt's mother's own account, she never thought that her son would become the President of the United States, nor did she dare to harbor such an excessive dream.

However, she wasn't completely without hope for her only child. Like other mothers, she also harbored an important hope for her child. But her hope was simple. She only hoped that when Roosevelt grew up, he would be as fair, straightforward, gentle, and sincere as his father, and become a noble and useful American.

Roosevelt's mother educated her son according to this goal and finally achieved her purpose. This goal, although simple, is reasonable and fundamental.

The ideals and hopes that parents have for their children should be considered from a fundamental point of view, and only by considering them from a fundamental point of view can they be reasonable. Occupation and social status are closely related to a person's opportunities and abilities, and often cannot be achieved by parents' fantasies. Overly high expectations will only lead to shattered dreams and broken hearts.

Roosevelt's mother's hope for her son can serve as a mirror for parents all over the world.

### Airplane Parachute

— Ke Zhong

American aviator Goodwin believes that after aircraft parts are damaged in the air, there is no need to crash to the ground. Therefore, he designed an airplane to carry a parachute so that it can land safely when it cannot fly. This method has been successfully tested. The parachute used by the aircraft in the picture is 52 feet in diameter. When the parachute was opened at a height of 500 feet above the ground, the aircraft was able to land safely, and the result was exceptionally satisfactory. The use of parachutes on airplanes may become an important page in the history of aviation.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Twelve Unexpected Disturbances

If Old Man Meng, the shopkeeper, had any humanity left, he would have helped Begonia on his own accord. Every day, no matter what time it was, as long as he walked from the back room to the front shop and looked across the street, he could see Begonia sitting alone on a stool in the doorway, looking dejected. Whenever someone walked by on the street, he would immediately raise his head, open his eyes wide, and eagerly look at the person coming. When he realized that it wasn't Little Dog, or the postman he was hoping for, he would sigh and lower his head again. He was waiting and hoping like this from morning to night, and he didn't even seem to be eating anything.

"Nothing again today, let's see tomorrow!" the postman said with a helpless look. For half a month, he had gotten used to it. When passing by the Wu family's door, without waiting for Begonia to ask, he would often say this on his own accord. As a result, he added to Begonia's depression.

The depression became heavier and heavier, and unknowingly it made the person's spirit worse day by day.

In less than twenty days, Begonia looked much older than before. Although his constantly frowning expression couldn't move the heart of Old Man Meng, who had been a merchant for thirty or forty years, it made his daughter-in-law feel very uneasy.

"Don't worry! Uncle Wu, Meibao will definitely come back soon." One evening, she finally quietly came to the Wu's house, her face flushed, and said to Begonia: "Worrying now is useless. She must be staying somewhere safely, but... but..." (208)

### The Power of the Giant Bell

— Guo Guo

The giant bell—once again emits its heart-shaking reputation.

Having seen the other great film of Min Hua, "Song of Ancient Bell", one may retain an unforgettable impression regarding the "beauty" of its content, the purity of its consciousness, its abandonment of some old materials, and its emphasis on a spirit of "hard fighting" and "hard defense" among the characters, with each doing their duty and welcoming victory. This is coupled with Mr. Fei Mu's meticulous attitude toward production.

However, I don't intend to elaborate on this further in this article. What I want to talk about is Min Hua, from which this film originated.

"Min Hua is organized by a group of young people," "They deeply believe they can understand their goals 'clearly'." This is a fragment from the preface published by the owner of Min Hua when "Confucius" was released. "Human beings are on the path of 'upward' and 'towards good', and film should be one of the tools for 'leading upward' and 'leading towards good'." This is their interpretation of their goals. And the serious and uncompromising work attitude shown in Min Hua's several profound and powerful products over the years is enough to prove that they are constantly striving towards this goal.

Therefore, standing from the perspective of a pure audience member, for this Min Hua, which has a good tendency and is composed of extremely serious and responsible people like Mr. Fei Mu and a group of young people, there is nothing but a fervent hope that it can expand its organization, increase its speed, and film more works that combine "light" and "heat" for the people in the isolated island, so that it can use its heart-shaking bell sound to dispel the darkness, awaken justice, and fully exert its power of "leading upward" and "leading towards good."

### Gai Jiaotian's Unique Skills

— Que Wei

The unique skills of Gai Jiaotian recorded in this article are neither Chang Yuchun's whip in the play "Wisely Capturing Beihuzhou" nor Nezha's Universe Ring, but three famous plays uniquely created by Gai Wu.

In "Evil Tiger Village," Huang Daba's single-blade swings with a whooshing sound, and his agile circling when shooting two friends with darts is unparalleled.

Wu Song's Drunkenly Beating Jiang Menshen and Hu Sanniang are best performed with Tan Yongkui and Qi Caifen. Using a dagger to throw at Hu Sanniang, the dagger lands on her neck, deeply embedded in the stage floor, with no room to spare. Furthermore, using a rectangular table to throw at Hu Sanniang, Qi Caifen can kick it away with her slender feet, which is amazing.

In "Three Iron Roosters," when Zhang Jiaxiang is playing towards the Marshal, he wears a fake braid with black coarse silk forming a beard at the end. When Zhang Jiaxiang is leading the horse for the Marshal, he does more than ten somersaults, and finally stands facing the Marshal, slightly pulling his neck. The fake braid can wrap around the neck three times, and the right hand makes a gesture of holding the reins while the left hand uses two or three fingers to hold the beard at the end of the braid. The wonderful thing is that it matches the gongs and drums on the stage perfectly, truly a unique skill.

### Recent Developments in the Shanghai Xiangqi (Chinese Chess) Scene

— Xue Weihan

Recently, the Shanghai Xiangqi scene is thriving, with chess matches, chess magazines, and chess clubs springing up like mushrooms after rain. The lively situation is unprecedented.

I am very excited about the widespread dissemination of this proper form of entertainment, so I am briefly reporting on what I have seen and heard in the chess world as an introduction:

The Weihan Cup Xiangqi Tournament was held, causing a sensation, and the number of enthusiasts increased sharply. The art of Xiangqi has been valued, considered to cultivate the mind and body, release intelligence, and is worth promoting.

As a result, the popularity of Xiangqi in Shanghai is booming. The "Hua Lian Cup", "Yiyou Cup", and "Jingwu Cup" Xiangqi tournaments were held one after another, with excellent results. The long-planned charity tournament will also open, with a large chessboard suspended in the auditorium of the Hua Lian Tongle Club. Shan Xiafeng, Lian Yi, Customs, Qingyun, Qunying, Yi Lian, Nanhua, Donghua, Nanfeng, Xinguang, Dehua, Zaifeng, Juehuo and other groups are participating in the competition. Ticket sales and recording charity sales are considerable.

Promoting national essence, chess clubs stand in great numbers, such as Xafeng, Cequn, Lewen, and Lianyi. These are all high-class chess playing venues.

Contemporary masters of Xiangqi include Lian Xuezheng, Luo Tianyang, Li Wushang, Bao Zibo, and Pan Minggang. Rising stars include Wu Jianqiu, Xie Wenjun, Jia Antai, Wang Qianzhong, Zhou Xueming, Song Yishan, Cen Minggao, Chen Rongtang, Wu Chuanggui, Tao Qingyuan, Xu Daqing, Huang Jingen, Yu Zeru, Cai Yifei, and Cai Wende, all of whom have outstanding skills and prominent reputations. Gu Junyuan, Tang Shouchun and others are particularly enthusiastic about promoting and spare no effort. Therefore, I have high hopes for the Shanghai Xiangqi scene!

Due to space limitations today, the chess garden will be published tomorrow. (Editor)

Chapter Sixteen: Escaping the Cage with a Lovely Bird

The few words that Yuanyuan said were too intense. She didn't care about taboos and defied Tian Hongyu's wishes, yet she refused to remain silent, and this was because she held another kind of foolish hope in her heart. Before, when she was by the Gusu Terrace, Wu Sangui admired her beauty and sent a messenger from outside the customs to propose marriage with generous gifts of gold. However, at that time, her heart was already devoted to the lyricist, Prince Xi, so she politely declined. When Wu Sangui later sent a confidant to propose again, Yuanyuan had already been forcibly taken away by Tian Hongyu. Now, hearing that Wu Sangui was in Beijing, she couldn't help but feel something in her heart, regretting that she hadn't married Sangui earlier. Wouldn't it be better to serve a dashing and famous general than this senile, declining old man Tian? When Tian Hongyu pressed her for a solution, she came up with this plan, wanting nothing more than to see Wu Sangui's face again. At first, when Tian Hongyu heard Yuanyuan say this, he couldn't help but feel a little annoyed, thinking that Yuanyuan was comparing him to Shi Chong, which felt very ominous. But then he thought to himself that if he wanted to seek peace and security, he had to befriend a general, so Wu Sangui was a brilliant man of the time, and he should associate with him and cater to his preferences. Yuanyuan's words were not unreasonable, just a bit too straightforward. So he said to Yuanyuan, "Alright, you speak so frankly? I'll listen to your plan." Yuanyuan then turned around and said, "Does Your Lordship think my words are correct? This little woman is talking nonsense, and I would like to ask Your Lordship to consider it carefully." Tian Hongyu stroked his beard and said, "I must protect my family's life and property, and have a strong backer, so this is the only way to do it." So, the next day, Tian Hongyu ran to Wu Sangui's place to visit. Originally, Wu Sangui's family home was in Beijing, and his father, Wu _, was currently serving as the director of the Imperial Guard. When Wu Sangui came to Beijing, he lived at home and often had banquets, and his door was very lively. This day, Sangui was resting after a banquet when he suddenly heard that State Father Tian had arrived. He wondered why this person, whom he had no close relationship with, would suddenly come to visit. He immediately invited him in to meet him. (165)
