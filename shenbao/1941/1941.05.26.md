Luoyang: The Japanese, with 120,000 to 130,000 troops, are exerting all their strength to launch their 14th offensive against the Chinese Zhongtiao Mountains, in an attempt to encircle the Chinese field army. The battle began on the 7th of this month and has been raging for nearly two weeks, with fierce fighting every day. During the intense battles, Japanese aircraft and artillery launched attacks with unprecedented ferocity. The Chinese fought bitterly, holding the Zhongtiao Mountains for half a month, killing nearly ten thousand Japanese and inflicting heavy losses. Currently, the Chinese have shifted to outer line operations and launched a counter-encirclement against the Japanese. At the same time, the Chinese armies in eastern and western Shanxi have also launched separate offensives against the Japanese, hoping to inflict even greater damage. (Dispatch of the 23rd) Somewhere in Eastern Zhejiang: Chinese troops pursuing north from Zhuji captured Yaogongbu on the afternoon of the 21st.

(Dispatch of the 23rd)

### Japanese Casualties in the Zhongtiao Mountains Reach 40,000

Chongqing: According to an official Central News Agency report, the Japanese army suffered more than 40,000 casualties during their 14th "mopping-up" campaign in the Zhongtiao Mountains of Shanxi Province in the past two weeks. The Japanese army used 120,000 troops in the operation, but the Chinese army switched to outer line operations and counter-encircled the Japanese forces. The official report also stated that the Chinese army had blocked the Japanese army in Guangdong Province from advancing along the East River and had recaptured Chuanluo on Sunday evening, leaving 1,500 Japanese bodies and fleeing towards Shilong. Boluo and Zidi are the only areas in Guangdong Province with a surplus of rice. This year, there is a surplus of 1.2 million dan of rice. The Japanese army's attack on these areas may be aimed at seizing food. The official report also stated that the Chinese army recaptured Linpu Town, 28 miles north of Zhuji in Zhejiang Province, last Friday and continued to sweep Xiaoshan. Another part of the Japanese army was surrounded at Jianshan, seven miles south of Linpu Town. The Chinese and Japanese armies are currently engaged in a stalemate in the Zhongtiao Mountains area of southern Shanxi. The Chinese army is also counter-attacking Japanese positions in eastern and western Shanxi and has achieved particular success in the Qinshui area. A Central News Agency dispatch from Luoyang stated that the majority of the Chinese army is maneuvering on both sides of the Japanese army in southern Shanxi, waiting for an opportunity to strike at the Japanese lines of communication during the Chinese army's general counter-offensive. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)

### The Japanese Seem to Have Abandoned Their River-Crossing Plan

Luoyang: The evacuation of Luoyang has eased somewhat today because it is believed that the Japanese have abandoned their preparations to cross the river. It is reported that the Eighth Route Army has attacked the Japanese lines of communication in Shanxi and is moving south to assist the Central Army recently reinforced in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Therefore, it is believed that the Japanese have abandoned their river-crossing plan. It is said that two-thirds of the Eighth Route Army is operating against the Japanese lines of communication. It is reported that the Pinghan Railway has been cut by the Chinese army in two places, the Tongpu Railway (the north-south trunk line of Shanxi Province) has been cut in three places, and the newly built Qingbei (transliteration) Road has also been cut in two places. The evacuation of non-essential government agencies and civilians has slowed down because it is felt that the most severe period has passed. It is believed that the Japanese will not attack Luoyang at present, but most residents are still prepared to relocate immediately at any time. The reinforcement of the Central Army in Shanxi Province and the fact that the Japanese are not currently making a major attempt to cross the river have led people to believe that the Chinese army can stop any advance from the north bank of the Yellow River into Henan Province. The Chinese side is well aware that as long as the Japanese still hold the southern part of the Zhongtiao Mountains and are stationed at the mouth of the Yellow River, Luoyang will still be threatened and may become a "dead city" like Zhengzhou. (Associated Press dispatch of the 25th)

### Government Agencies Change Office Hours

Chongqing: Because Chongqing has been frequently harassed by air raids recently, from tomorrow onwards, the office hours of government agencies will be changed to 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily. (Associated Press dispatch of the 25th)

### Chinese Shoot Down Three Japanese Aircraft Over Chengdu and Eastern Sichuan—Japanese Aircraft Bomb Various Locations in Shaanxi and Gansu—

Chongqing: News today indicates that Chinese fighter planes shot down two Japanese aircraft during the night air raids on Chengdu and various cities and towns in eastern and northern Sichuan Province last week. According to a Japanese pilot, although many bombs were dropped during the fierce bombing of Chengdu airport, only one unimportant building suffered minor damage, and only a few craters were created in the field because most of the bombs fell in the fields. (Associated Press dispatch of the 25th)

Chengdu: Mr. and Mrs. White, medical missionaries at the American Church Hospital in Wuhu, arrived here on May 12. The plane they were traveling on was bombed by Japanese aircraft in Xufu on May 20. As soon as the passenger plane arrived in Xufu, Japanese aircraft appeared. The passengers hurriedly ran out and hid in nearby ditches. The bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft were small, so the passenger plane was not badly damaged. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)

Lanzhou: Two Japanese aircraft flew over Gansu Province on the morning of the 24th for reconnaissance. One of them intruded into the airspace over Lanzhou City and was driven away by the Chinese. The other reached a certain location in southern Longnan and then turned back. (Dispatch of the 24th)

### One Japanese Aircraft Shot Down Over Lanzhou

Lanzhou: Twenty-five Japanese bombers and twelve fighter planes successively attacked Shaanxi and Gansu provinces on the morning of the 22nd.

The Chinese Air Force engaged in fierce air combat with the Japanese aircraft west of Lanzhou, damaging two Japanese bombers, which left the formation immediately with smoke coming from their tails. A telegram was received here that evening from Jingyuan reporting that a Japanese aircraft was found crashed near Jing, with both the aircraft and crew destroyed. (Dispatch of the 25th)

Gansu Provincial Government Plans to Establish a Anti-Smoking Memorial Hall

Ji'an: This year is the final year of the six-year anti-smoking plan. The provincial authorities have decided to establish a anti-smoking memorial hall in Ji'an to commemorate the anti-smoking policy. They are currently drawing up plans and preparing for construction. (Dispatch of the 23rd)

### Increase in Japanese Immigrants to Hainan Island

Shaoguan: The number of Japanese people who immigrated to Hainan Island was 3,928 at the end of March, and has now increased to 5,327. This includes 2,506 from the mainland and 208 from Taiwan. In terms of activity areas, 2,429 people are in the northern part (including 1,785 people in Haikou City, the first major city on the island), and 2,898 people are in the southern part. Most of these immigrants are ruffians, mixed with so-called demobilized soldiers. (Dispatch of the 23rd)

### Zhang Yilin and Others Jointly Send a Telegram to Zhu De and Mao Zedong

Hong Kong: Zhang Yilin and other councilors residing in Hong Kong believe that the large-scale Japanese offensive in the Zhongtiao Mountains is of great importance to the future of the war. They have sent a special telegram to Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and others of the Eighteenth Group Army, urging them to fight the Japanese with all their strength in the area designated by the central government. (Dispatch of the 25th) Chongqing: The gist of Zhou Enlai's letter to the Dagongbao newspaper, which was previously telegraphed, is very pertinent. He stated, in essence, "We must now call on the soldiers and civilians of the entire country to persevere in the war of independence and self-reliance, use the strength of democracy and unity to overcome the current and future major difficulties, break the enemy's blockade and division, and prepare for our counter-offensive." (Havas dispatch of the 25th)

Chongqing: The Dagongbao newspaper's editorial a few days ago, urging the Eighteenth Group Army to quickly come to the aid of the Zhongtiao Mountains battlefield, has won unanimous praise from all parties. However, the CCP representative Zhou Enlai sent a letter to the newspaper, strongly refuting the Japanese rumors as unfounded. As a result, the newspaper wrote another article, elaborating further. The wording is more profound and sincere than its first editorial. It stated, in essence, that the core of the previous morning's commentary was just one sentence: it is expected that the fact of the Eighteenth Group Army cooperating in the war will be demonstrated as soon as possible. As long as there is this fact, we will be satisfied. In addition, we do not expect that there must be great victories. The reason for expecting this fact is not only to dispel Japanese rumors, but also because after four years of war, China and Japan have both reached a serious stage. The Japanese hope that China will split and fall into chaos, so the Chinese people's need for unity and self-defense is naturally more urgent. However, the CCP organization has international characteristics, and its concept of the state is not entirely the same as that of ordinary people. The history of years of strife before the war and the discord that has emerged again recently have created a situation where the Soviet-Japanese neutrality treaty has been established. The CCP has always been most faithful to the Soviet Union, so people want to know how the CCP's future policies will be affected by the Soviet-Japanese compromise and whether the CCP will remain on the front line of national self-defense. Therefore, it is expected that there will be cooperative war-fighting facts to quickly comfort the hopes of the compatriots. It is deeply hoped that this joint operation in Shanxi will be the starting point for negotiating and resolving all the events that should be handled between the General Headquarters and the Eighteenth Group Army, and rebuilding the bulwark of unity. The newspaper most thoroughly expounds on the fundamental understanding of nation-building and the historical errors of the CCP, asking the members of the CCP to consider them. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)

### Construction Can Begin Immediately

Shaoguan: The Guangdong Agricultural and Forestry Bureau recently plans to establish a bone meal factory. The site has been selected and construction can begin in a month. The design of the machinery is the responsibility of the Industrial Cooperative Society. It is estimated that by the end of this year, 60,000 to 70,000 dan of bone meal can be produced. In addition to purchasing raw materials in Guangdong, they can also be transported from Hunan and Guangxi. (Dispatch of the 23rd)

Editorial

### The Sinking of the Hood and the Naval Contest Between Britain and Germany

German naval raiding has been a major problem for British shipping, and the tools used have always been aircraft and submarines. German large warships sometimes venture out to sea for action, but this is considered insignificant. Especially since the sinking of the Admiral Graf Spee by a British cruiser with far weaker tonnage and armament, a general idea of ​​underestimating the German navy has been created, and it is believed that the Battle of Jutland in 1916 is unlikely to be repeated in this war. However, in the naval battle near Greenland this time, the new German battleship Bismarck showed its capabilities for the first time and sank the British battlecruiser Hood, which accounted for the world's largest tonnage, proving that the German army's tools for implementing threats in the Atlantic have expanded from aircraft and submarines to warships. Although the shock of this battle is the same as that of the Battle of the Falkland Islands, its impact will be even more significant.

In the current competition of the European War, the army has temporarily no use, but what both sides intend to compete for is the hegemony at sea. If Britain can maintain its naval superiority for a long time, it can passively protect Britain and its overseas transportation, and actively exert the effect of blockading Germany. If this superiority is broken, not only will the British Empire be dismembered, but even without the German army invading, Britain will be in danger of being strangled. Whether the sinking of the Hood is a sign that cracks have appeared in the British naval authority is a question that people are eager to answer. Let's first briefly review this battle itself.

The sinking of the Hood is a major loss for Britain, but its significance is not very serious. Although the ship has a large tonnage, it is old. Its tonnage, which is one-third larger than the Bismarck, can only provide armament and speed that are comparable to it. Moreover, the 20-year difference in age has already determined the superiority or inferiority of the two ships' performance. Looking at the process of the sinking of the Hood, the speed of its sinking and the number of crew members who died are enough to prove that the report published by the British side that the ammunition depot was hit and exploded is indeed the truth. Rather than attributing it to the excellent German warship, it must be said that it was to some extent accidental, because until after the German warship won, the German side could not accurately say that what it sank was the Hood. This large and useless warship belongs to the battlecruiser class, and as usual, it has to sacrifice armor to enhance its armament and speed. Compared with the 31,000-ton Queen Elizabeth class or the 33,500-ton Nelson class battleships, its armor is as thin as one or two inches. This is probably the main weakness of the Hood, which is the same as the sinking situation of the Admiral Graf Spee. In terms of armament, the eight 15-inch guns installed on the Hood are not the most ideal weapons for battleships. The recently launched British King George V class, equipped with ten 14-inch guns, has much better projectile launching force and penetrating force than the eight 15-inch guns. If what the German warship encountered was not the old Hood but this type of new battleship, the result would be very different. The unparalleled authority of the British Navy has always been built on the superior power and multi-faceted performance of its ships and its excellent traditions. This has not changed to any extent until now.

In terms of nature, this naval battle off Greenland can be determined to be an encounter battle, because the main battle was obviously what the German warship tried to avoid. Its main task was not to confront but to raid. It is undoubtedly brave to lightly engage in the ocean with only a few main battleships, but the risk is also extremely high. It is possible to be ambushed by the British Navy at any time in the vast ocean. Moreover, once it is damaged, it is absolutely impossible to safely return to its home naval base. Compared with the British, who have convenient repair facilities on both the east and west coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, the two cannot be compared. At present, in addition to the Bismarck and its sister ship Tirpitz, the German main battleships also include two 26,000-ton Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. After repeated bombings by the British Air Force, the extent of the damage is still a mystery. According to general speculation, the two 40,000-ton main battleships that began to be built in 1937 are believed to have been launched. In fact, its strength is not far from the level of the undamaged French navy. It should not be underestimated. However, with the strength of the British side, it is still more than capable of dealing with it.

At present, the British side's concern at sea is not the strength or weakness of its strength and the sinking of a few ships, but the dispersion of the battle lines. The British Navy is currently undertaking a task that is more arduous than at any other time. Protecting overseas routes and various territories is already extremely difficult. The current bloody battle in the Mediterranean and Crete is attracting the largest part of the British Navy's strength. It is only natural that the German side is taking this opportunity to develop the Atlantic offensive, because Nazi ships have no other tasks to bear. If the Battle of the Mediterranean continues to be deadlocked or unfortunately deteriorates, the threat to the Atlantic will also increase. The significance of the Battle of Greenland to Britain is not only the sinking of a giant ship, but also that this multi-faceted offensive will make Britain feel tricky. However, if the situation in Crete and Iraq can improve rapidly, the naval strength in the Mediterranean can be withdrawn and strengthened to defend the Atlantic, and everything will naturally change greatly.

The United States is now on the eve of a major decision. This naval battle took place in the waters near Greenland under the protection of the United States. This is undoubtedly a major stimulus for the American officials and people, and it will further strengthen the active factors in Roosevelt's speech tomorrow. The more serious the situation in the Atlantic, the more quickly the United States will share Britain's war responsibilities. The sinking of the Hood is a major victory for the German Navy, but its impact will make Germany's prospects for success even more slim.

Unprecedented Naval Battle in the North Atlantic

### 42,000-Ton British Battleship "Hood" Sunk. Ammunition Depot Hit, More Than a Thousand Soldiers Killed. German Battleship "Bismarck" Also Heavily Damaged.

London: Last night, the British Navy Department announced that the British battlecruiser "Hood" (42,000 tons, the world's largest battleship) was intercepting the German fleet off Greenland on Saturday morning when it was unfortunately hit in the main ammunition depot, causing the ship to explode and sink. It is feared that few crew members survived. The German fleet included the battleship "Bismarck," which was damaged. The British fleet is still pursuing it. The "Hood" was built in 1920 and carried eight 15-inch guns, twelve 5.5-inch guns, and four 4-inch anti-aircraft guns. Its speed was 30 nautical miles. The captain was Cole Oberon. It usually had 2,341 officers and soldiers.

The German battleship "Bismarck" had a displacement of 30,000 tons and a speed of 30 nautical miles. It was launched in early February 1939 and carried eight 15-inch guns and twelve 5-inch guns. It was 79 feet long and 116 feet wide. It was a sister ship of the "Tirpitz." (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that the fleet commanded by German Fleet Commander General Lütjens encountered a British cruising fleet in the Icelandic area and a battle occurred. The German battleship "Bismarck" sank the battleship "Hood," which is known as the largest warship in the world. The newly built British warship "King George" was also injured and retreated. The entire German fleet triumphed without any losses. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 25th)

London: Outside the coast of Greenland, which is under the protection of the United States, a major battle occurred between the British and German navies yesterday. The German new-style battleship "Bismarck" hit the ammunition depot of the British battlecruiser "Hood," and the British ship exploded and sank, killing more than a thousand people. The 39,000-ton "Bismarck" was also damaged. The British fleet is now chasing the German fleet to the east. The "Hood" had a displacement of 41,000 tons and was the world's largest battlecruiser. When it sank, following the true traditional precepts of the British Navy, its eight 15-inch guns and countless small guns roared together, and the flags still flew. Commander Vice Admiral Holland is believed to have been killed in action. The "Hood" usually had 1,341 combat officers, soldiers, and crew. The "Bismarck" had eight 15-inch guns. This was said to be the first time it had joined the battle, and it was also the first time that the Atlantic lifeline had been threatened by a formidable German fleet. The "Hood" had several tons of steel armor to protect its hull, so it was always regarded as invincible and unsinkable. Since the Battle of Jutland, this has been the most severe loss for the British Navy. The British Navy Department did not mention the injuries of other British and German ships. The British naval circles admitted that the British fleet is scattered around the world and its strength is weak. Therefore, this loss is a serious blow to the British Navy, but they also pointed out that the King George V class battleships are now intact. (International dispatch of the 15th)

### Details of the Naval Battle

London: The world's largest battleship, "Hood," was sunk by a German battleship yesterday. Just as thousands of relatives of the ship's personnel are mourning their casualties, millions of Britons are eagerly awaiting the latest news of the first encounter between the British and German navies. Authoritative sources have supplemented the Central Navy Department's bulletin, stating that the "Hood" was apparently fatally struck by a 15-inch giant shell fired by the German battleship "Bismarck." The iron armor protecting the side of the ship's turret, which was one foot thick, was penetrated by the shell. The shell also used the power of the cyclone to penetrate directly into the ship's main ammunition depot. The ship shook and staggered violently, and due to the howling cold wind, the waves around the ship were constantly impacting it. Thus, after a few minutes of swaying, the glorious history of this disabled "Hood" for twenty years came to an end. The "Bismarck," which was protected by Nazi destroyers, cruisers, and some light warships, wanted to end the battle after being injured, but the British battleships kept firing on it and intercepted the German flagship and its fleet to prevent them from escaping. (International dispatch of the 25th)

### The United States is Shocked

Washington: The loss of the "Hood" shocked American diplomatic and naval officials. Privately, it is predicted that the demand for the complete use of the US Navy to ensure the safe arrival of military supplies in Britain will increase in the future. The fact that the naval battle in which the "Hood" was sunk occurred near Greenland raises the question of whether the area has been incorporated into the US Navy's patrol area. However, the US government has not given any indication of what action it will take. Some speculate that this may cause President Roosevelt to slightly modify his fireside chat scheduled for the second day. (International dispatch of the 25th)

New York: US General Stirling recently wrote an article on the sinking of the "Hood." His article stated, in essence, that the British-German naval battle on Saturday, in which Britain lost the world's largest battleship, "Hood," is enough to prove the weakness of battlecruisers. The armor of the "Hood" was far less than that of the Nelson and Rodney class ships. The "Hood" only had 12 inches of armor, while the "Nelson" had 14 inches of armor protection. The "Hood" only had 12 inches of bulletproof equipment, while the "Nelson" had 16 inches. In the Battle of Jutland in the last war, the British ship "Mary" was also a battlecruiser and was destroyed by a shell. The destruction of the "Hood" today may be due to the same reason. This naval battle may be the largest direct naval battle between Britain and Germany since the Battle of Jutland. Naval personnel are quite skeptical about whether the fully armored King George V class ships participated in the war. As for the participants in the German fleet, it is feared that it includes not only the "Bismarck," but also several German pocket battleships, destroyers, submarines, or even the "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau," if they were not damaged in the British Air Force's bombing of Brest, they may also participate. (Associated Press dispatch of the 25th)

### Berlin's Jubilation

Berlin, Germany - The sinking of the German ship "Holt" and the crippling of another British battleship have caused great jubilation. The German High Command admitted that the German fleet had suffered some minor losses, but stated that the revitalized German navy would strike with "full force" to destroy America's "full force" support for Britain. Britain's inland fleet #is Britain's primary defense against German ships#. However, the German fleet will soon take the lead in a full-scale attack on the British inland fleet. This victory is a clear victory in the first test of the German main fleet. Germany issued an announcement regarding the engagement between Iceland and the "Holt," stating that the ship "exploded from the surface of the water," and few of its crew survived. The announcement did not specify whether the naval battle was still continuing. The German High Command declared that the direct confrontation of giant battleships was the first in history. The result of this war can be said that the German navy, possessing new-style dreadnoughts, has been able to break Britain's naval control, as the German dreadnoughts can destroy Britain's giant ships. (May 25th, International Telegram)

Berlin - The sinking of the British ship "Holt" was unanimously praised by the German national newspapers as "one of the most glorious pages in German naval history." Air Force General Goering's mouthpiece stated that "Bismarck" had eliminated the greatest power of the British Navy, and the last pillar of Britain's fantasy of victory had also fallen. Germany's victory in the North Atlantic naval battle has significant political implications. (May 25th, International Telegram)

### British Far East Air Force Deputy Commander Delivers Broadcast Speech - Says British Air Force in Singapore Has Immense Offensive and Defensive Power

Singapore - Air Vice-Marshal Pulford, who took office as Commander of the British Far East Air Force five weeks ago, delivered his first broadcast tonight, stating that the British Air Force in this region has immense power, both offensively and defensively. However, he repeatedly stated that Britain has no intention of invading other countries in the Pacific. Pulford declared that the offensive power of the British forces in the Far East has reached a very high level, and behind them, there is an unlimited amount of American supply, and this supply has never been interrupted, because the United States is our true and loyal friend. Pulford also stated that although there are currently raiding ships attacking merchant ships, American military supplies are still arriving safely in Singapore as usual. Pulford also stated that we should not think that the purpose of the Air Force is still to defend Singapore. It should be known that last year, we completed a connection of military airfields everywhere, from the northern border to Singapore and Borneo, and there are also facilities in Burma, and far from the border with China. If the war spreads to the Far East, these airfields can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes. (May 25th, United Press Telegram)

### Fierce Battles Unfold Around Maleme Airfield - British Planes Reappear Over Crete - The Roar of Artillery Prevents German Reinforcements

Cairo - According to the latest information received here, the reappearance of British fighter planes over Crete has greatly excited the Allied forces. The key point on the island, still occupied by the Germans, is Maleme. The Allied forces have stepped up their attack on this point. Since Heraklion and Rethymno have been recaptured by the Allied forces, the Allied forces can assist in attacking the Maleme airfield. British artillery shells and bombs are falling like rain day and night on the airfield. Although the Germans have lost many soldiers and aircraft, they are still holding on, waiting for the arrival of aircraft carrying soldiers and equipment. It is reported that British long-range artillery is damaging German troop transport planes. It is reported that troop transport planes are unloading soldiers on the beach, but each time they are swept clean by British fighter planes. Recent Middle East communiqués state that on Friday, the German attempt to reinforce Crete, and the troops parachuted into the white sky in Heraklion and Rethymno have been effectively resolved.

Cairo - A military spokesman here announced last night that there is still very fierce fighting on Crete, but the situation in Heraklion and Rethymno is, on the whole, satisfactory. The situation in Maleme is still tense. British morale is very good, and they are fighting bravely all day long, regardless of dive bombing, and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.

Cairo - New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser told a Reuters interviewer yesterday that the outcome of the Battle of Crete could be determined in the next few hours. He is confident that the brave New Zealand soldiers, Australian, British, and Greek warriors on the island will be able to hold the island in an unprecedented environment, resisting an unprecedented aerial attack. Although the situation on the island is very favorable for aerial attacks, the German air force bases are very close, and the Allied forces have reported a lack of aerial support, but he firmly believes that the Allied forces will eventually win, and the New Zealand soldiers will be able to perform on Crete.

### Berlin Issues Special Communiqué - Boasts Success of New Tactics

Berlin - German radio stations broadcast a special communiqué from the German High Command at 4:30 PM yesterday. First, they announced the landing of German troops on Crete, stating briefly that on the fifth day of the operation, Germany had occupied the western half of Crete. The British fleet north of Crete had been repulsed. It was stated that Crete is at least one hundred kilometers from mainland Greece, and that the landing of troops from the sky is unprecedented in military history, and that the battle of Crete is clearly different from the battles of the small Aegean islands. The battle of Crete has proven that air power is more important than naval power in modern warfare. It is believed that the battle of Crete is a precursor to even more important battles of the same kind. (May 25th, Haitong Telegram)

Berlin - The fierce naval and air battle between Britain and Germany in the waters off Crete from the 21st to the 23rd of this month is clear evidence that the Air Force can control the Navy. Each British battleship has more than 40 anti-aircraft guns and machine guns, and light cruisers have 12. The intensity of the anti-aircraft fire at that time can be imagined, but the German planes were eventually able to sink many British ships, which shows the power of the Air Force. (May 25th, Haitong Telegram)

London - The German High Command has issued a special communiqué, for the first time mentioning the Battle of Crete, stating that since the morning of May 20th, German paratroopers and troops transported by aircraft have successively landed on Crete to fight against the British army, aided by fighter squadrons and bomber squadrons, seizing important strongholds. After the German army continues to receive reinforcements, it will take the offensive, and the western part of the island will be in the hands of the German army. The German Air Force has sunk and destroyed many enemy ships, and has established air superiority in the entire theater of war. The entire war is now continuing to develop according to the planned plan. The German High Command will order the adoption of appropriate retaliatory measures against English prisoners numbering ten times as many, Prime Minister Churchill's statement that German paratroopers are wearing nylon army uniforms is incorrect, this is a pretext for the British to treat German paratroopers in violation of international law.

### Soviet Pravda Publishes Article Commenting on the Importance of the Cretan War

Moscow - Pravda recently published an article entitled "The Battle for Crete," stating, "The battle of Crete is extremely noteworthy, because this is the first decisive test of a large number of troops landing from the air under the supervision of the British Navy. The battle of Crete is extremely important for the future development of the eastern Mediterranean. As far as Britain is concerned, after Crete is lost, it will not only lose its base for defending Egypt, but its position in the Near East will also be greatly threatened. At the same time, the crisis of the Suez Canal will also increase. On the other hand, after Germany takes Crete, it can freely use its superior air force base to bomb Alexandria and other British bases. Undoubtedly, the German offensive in Crete is a new stage in the battle for maritime communications. Washington is paying close attention to the development of the Mediterranean. The publication of Stimson's and the US Secretary of the Navy's speeches calling for the repeal of the Neutrality Act coincides with the intense fighting in the eastern Mediterranean, which is particularly noteworthy.

### German Forces Advance in Two Routes - Ambush at Hellfire Pass - Eleven Tanks Destroyed - Remnants of Italian Army in Albania Being Eliminated

London - A Reuters correspondent with the vanguard of the British Army in the Western Desert reports that the most serious loss of tanks since the army appeared in Libya was on Friday. On that day, German forces advanced in two routes, seeking to enter the key points within the Egyptian border. "Hellfire Pass" The first route advanced along the edge of the slope and was ambushed by the British army near Cholun at 10:00 AM, and retreated. Two German tanks were destroyed and several were damaged. At noon, another German force was found trying to attack the British left flank, and was also attacked violently. Six enemy tanks were destroyed, and the rest were forced to retreat across the border. There were no losses to British tanks. On Wednesday, three German tanks were also destroyed near the border. Therefore, the German army lost a total of eleven tanks in forty minutes. Although this setback does not have a major impact on the total number of tanks that the German army can use in North Africa, it has proven that the German army's policy of attacking weak points and the strength of the British army's tanks has failed. In addition to tank activity, the German army has not shown any intention of regaining the land lost last week. Currently, the German army seems to be more focused on building defenses around the Gabes border area and Tobruk. (May 25th, Reuters Telegram)

Cairo - A communiqué here last night stated that a large sandstorm rose in the Tobruk area yesterday, obstructing the view and preventing combat operations. British patrols and artillery units in the Solun area are still continuing their offensive strategy. On Thursday night, a British bomber squadron attacked Benghazi, causing damage to the enemy. The South African Air Force is still bombing enemy transport teams and troop concentration points in Abyssinia to coordinate with the British forces in central Africa. The Mosul airfield in Iraq was also strafed by British planes. (May 25th, Reuters Telegram)

### US Army and Navy in Hawaii Conduct Large-Scale Exercises - Flying Fortresses Also Participate in the Battle - The Exercise Lasts Twelve Days

Honolulu - News yesterday stated that the US Army's Hawaiian fleet and officers are closely watching the German attempt to invade Crete, because they feel that Crete and Hawaii have several similarities in defense plans. The US Army's Hawaiian forces have just completed their largest exercise in history. This exercise demonstrated a program in which a vast mechanized force annihilated the "invaders." In addition to ground forces, this mechanized force also had "Flying Fortresses" recently flown here to help in the battle. Well-informed sources pointed out that the position of the US defense forces in Hawaii is somewhat similar to the position of the British and Greek defenders in Crete, but Hawaii may not have to deal with a large number of airborne soldiers like Crete. In the exercise, Hawaii's defense forces will fight against a fleet that occupies all the islands outside Oahu and attempts to land at the Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Honolulu, Oahu and the main defense fortresses of the army via the sea. According to unofficial sources, the distance between Hawaii and its closest "enemy" military base makes it very difficult for the enemy to supply the invading forces landed by aircraft on Oahu with the necessary military supplies, even after occupying the outer islands. This is the main difference between Hawaii and Crete, because when the German army attacked Crete, it could concentrate troops, equipment, and supplies on the nearby Greek mainland. After the outer islands were occupied by the enemy and enemy forces landed on Oahu, it was followed by the withdrawal of a portion of the US Navy in this area, so the decision was made for the enemy to simultaneously attack the US Pacific and Atlantic defenses. Part of the US Navy was forced to withdraw, and the remaining part of the US Navy was annihilated. Enemy forces landed, followed by naval bombardment and violent air attacks. In this battle, the enemy established a base in Oahu to threaten Honolulu and Pearl Harbor. The US Army stated that the final battle was taking place before dawn, when infantry, artillery, tanks, and engineering teams launched a fierce attack on the enemy's stronghold. A total of 1,000 soldiers participated in this final war, and the enemy was wiped out in the area between the mountains and the sea. Army officials stated that the most important tool for the defending soldiers, the Flying Fortress, cooperated with the ground troops attacking the enemy and dropped heavy bombs on the enemy forces. This exercise lasted for twelve days and was completed only yesterday, and each returned to its garrison. (May 25th, United Press Telegram)

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Endorses Amendment to Neutrality Act, Roosevelt Prepared to Speak on Tuesday, Will Express Something Regarding Maritime Freedom

Washington – According to yesterday’s investigation by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of the thirteen members on the committee, it is likely that if the administration proposes to abolish the Neutrality Act, they will endorse it. The other ten members will oppose it. However, in fact, the members of the committee have not yet officially decided what position they will take. However, privately, it is said that the voting ratio of the April 30th rejection of the ban on escorting ships will be the same for the vote on abolishing the Neutrality Act. The twenty-odd members of the Foreign Relations Committee have the advantage. Three members said that they have not received official news regarding President Roosevelt’s plan to propose the abolition of the Neutrality Act. However, they believe that Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox will not propose the abolition of the Neutrality Act in their recent speeches without the formal approval of the White House. (United Press dispatch of the 25th)

Washington – President Roosevelt is spending his weekend preparing for the speech he will deliver on Tuesday. At this time, calls from Congress and newspapers for amending the Neutrality Act have spread far and wide, indicating what the public hopes to hear from the President on Tuesday. According to many well-informed sources, what the President will say will mainly focus on (1) extending the Monroe Doctrine to the entire Atlantic Ocean, and (2) the need to restore the policy of maritime freedom. The restoration of the policy of maritime freedom will naturally involve the amendment of the Neutrality Act, as this Act prohibits American ships from entering war zones and contradicts the policy of freedom. The New York Times's commentary on the call for amending the Neutrality Act is quite incisive, stating that those who drafted this Act at the time believed that the United States only needed to issue an advance notice that in the event of war, the United States could automatically abandon its long-enjoyed maritime rights to protect the New World from war. It must be known that this kind of experiment has already failed. If this Act is intended to prevent the United States from joining the war, then why is the United States so eager to implement conscription, build a two-ocean navy, and make its own country a military factory producing airplanes and war materials? With this Neutrality Act, we are in great danger. The criticisms of this Act by Secretary of the Navy Knox and Secretary of War Stimson show that the President is now considering the restoration of the principle of maritime freedom to help Britain win the Atlantic victory. If the President makes this announcement on Tuesday, it will definitely receive the rapid support of the people and Congress. What is also noteworthy here is that the isolationists, who have always strongly opposed participating in the war, are now openly declaring that if the United States does participate in the war, they will faithfully rally behind the President. They certainly want the United States to participate in the war to a small extent, but once it is necessary to participate in the war, they will do their best to increase their combat power.

### French Officials Will Go to Paris to Continue Talks, Exchange Views on Some Practical Issues

Vichy – Political figures here recently stated that the Franco-German negotiations are now being carried out in accordance with the principles revealed in Associate Darlan's speech. A general outline has already been agreed upon, with only some practical issues remaining to be discussed by both sides, such as production prices and currency issues. Because French industry has suffered since the blockade, fuel and necessities are in short supply. Only cooperation with Germany can remedy this. Therefore, the free flow of raw materials and industrial products between the free and occupied zones of France is a matter of urgency. In addition, both sides have previously signed an agreement on Franco-German industrial cooperation, and this should continue to be promoted in the future. In addition, Agriculture Minister Caziot and Army Minister General Huntziger are scheduled to travel to Paris together tomorrow, and this is also related to the ongoing Franco-German negotiations.

Australian Prime Minister Returns Home, Delivers Speech, Advocates Forming a Government of National Unity

In the by-election held in the Busselton area, the government's candidate, Mr. Pulleine, won with a majority of votes. This is a harbinger of Prime Minister Menzies continuing to hold office, as this result can be regarded as the public's approval of the Australian government's war efforts and support for a government of national unity. Acting Australian Prime Minister Fadden said that this result is clear evidence that the Australian government's war policy is supported by the public. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)

### German Newspaper Slanders Roosevelt, Claims Jewish Ancestry

London – German newspapers yesterday published news attempting to prove that President Roosevelt is of Jewish descent, pointing out that President Roosevelt's advisors, such as Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Harvard University Professor Frankfurter, currency expert Baruch, New York Governor Lehman, etc., are almost all Jews. German radio broadcasts this news, saying that President Roosevelt once said that his ancestors arrived in America from the Netherlands about 300 years ago, and that he did not care whether they were Jews, Catholics, or Christians. According to investigations, in 1720, there were several people with the surname Roosevelt in New Amsterdam, and they were Jews, and their ancestors were certainly also Jews. The earliest traceable ancestor of the Roosevelt family was a Jewish woman. This is a fact, and her descendants often intermarried with Jews. Even President Roosevelt's mother came from a Jewish family, and the President's wife is also of Jewish blood. The President's mother-in-law's name is Hall, and she is indeed a Jew.

### Shigemitsu Probes US on Mediation of War

Chongqing – China is paying close attention to Japan's recall of its ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu, and speculates that Shigemitsu may probe Washington's response to US mediation of the Sino-Japanese war when he passes through the United States on his way back to Japan. It is understood that Shigemitsu is one of the few diplomats not replaced by Foreign Minister Matsuoka, so some believe that the decision to recall him may be due to this. (United Press dispatch of the 25th)

Chongqing – The Central Daily News commented on the impending return of Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu, saying that this shows that Anglo-Japanese relations are deteriorating daily. Although Shigemitsu claims that there is no sign of deterioration in Anglo-Japanese relations, we do not agree. Recently, when the British House of Commons met, Foreign Secretary Eden's statement of Britain's determination to help China in the war and oppose Japan's discrimination against British interests in China, and the remarks made by British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr regarding the Burma Road, were a major blow to the Japanese army. The fundamental reason for the deterioration of Anglo-Japanese relations is Japan's aggression in China and the destruction of British interests in China, which has created the current situation. The key to the problem today is whether Japan will realize its mistakes. I wonder if Shigemitsu will seriously consider this issue when he returns to Tokyo. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)

### Steady Supply from Hong Kong and Saigon Keeps Rice Prices from Rising, Rice Market Manipulations Unreliable, Actual Price of Saigon Rice Still Undisclosed

According to rice industry sources, Chu Qiaqing, while in Shanghai, ordered 8,000 tons (or 80,000 bags) of small-grain rice for May delivery directly from Rangoon on behalf of certain sundry grain stores. They are now en route to Shanghai and should arrive by the end of this month or the beginning of next month. However, the shipping lines used for the cargo are still unknown. Shanghai's food reserves are more than sufficient compared to any past period, and the Public Concession’s subsidized Hong Kong rice is also being shipped to Shanghai steadily. Furthermore, the French Municipal Council’s Saigon rice will also arrive soon. Not only is the food supply of the city guaranteed, but a continued drop in prices is also expected.

Saigon Rice Prices: No Firm News Yet

The Saigon rice directly ordered from the Vietnamese government by the French Municipal Council, in its first batch will arrive in Shanghai this month. Rumors say that there are as many as 200,000 bags, but according to reporters at the Pingming News Agency, there are in fact only about 100,000 bags, and only 50,000 bags have been shipped to Shanghai. As for the selling price of Saigon rice, Sarly did not clearly indicate it when he convened a meeting of sundry grain merchants last week to discuss sales. He only agreed to give a handling fee of 8%. However, according to general speculation, the selling price of Saigon rice in the future will probably be similar to the selling price of the Public Concession’s subsidized Hong Kong rice. In addition, the French shipping company’s General Joffre, arrived at the port of Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:30 pm, carrying 30,000 bags of Saigon rice. The reporter learned from other sources that some rice shops have obtained cheaper foreign rice from the authorities, so some are offering to sell it for 100 yuan.

Shanghai's Needs: Steadily Supplied

Although the French Municipal Council has only ordered 100,000 bags of Saigon rice from Vietnam for the time being, the import of this Saigon rice is entirely handled by the import committee organized by the three foreign firms, Dufour, etc. The French Municipal Council is in a supervisory position, while the Vietnamese side is also handled by the export committee, which is supervised by the Vietnamese government. From now on, Shanghai’s needs can be met and the rice will definitely be shipped on schedule without interruption.

Yesterday, 10,000 Bags Shipped from Nanning Arrived

At the same time, the subsidized Hong Kong rice ordered from the Hong Kong government by the Public Concession will also be supplied on schedule. The Taikoo Company's Nanning, carrying 10,000 bags of Hong Kong rice, arrived at the port at 10:00 AM yesterday and was docked at buoys 33 and 34 on the Huangpu River. Unloading began at 1:00 PM. The Suzhou, which was also carrying a nest of rice bags, did not arrive yesterday and will probably be delayed until today. It was rumored that the Hanyang, which arrived yesterday, was carrying 10,000 bags of Hong Kong rice, but according to an employee of Jardine Matheson, this was not the case. The ship did not carry rice this time.

Weighting and Refunds Begin Today

Currently, there are a total of 743 firms that have ordered subsidized Hong Kong rice from Jardine Matheson. According to Xiangmao Yanghang's statistics, as of last Saturday, payments have generally been completed. As for rice shops that picked up goods from the warehouses last week and found that the weight of each bag was less than 224 pounds, they can go to Xiangmao Yanghang to get a refund from today onwards with the weight slips from the three warehouses, San Yi, Paulsen, and David. The deadline is three days, until the 28th of this month.

The Stabilization Fund to be Established in Hong Kong

After the British and American loans to China, the sound organization of the Stabilization Fund Committee, the consolidation of the statutory foreign exchange, the maintenance of the Shanghai black market, and the full consolidation of the legal tender, the members of the Stabilization Fund Committee have been appointed by China, Britain, and the United States. (1) The United States is represented by economic commissioner Fox, (2) Britain is represented by economic expert Rogers, and (3) China is represented by Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Trade Commission, Xi Demao, director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and Bei Songsun, manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China. The reporter from the New Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles that Rogers and Fox will come to China. As soon as they arrive in Hong Kong, the first committee meeting will be held to announce the establishment of the committee. The committee will be based in Hong Kong, stabilize the statutory foreign exchange, authorize the Central Bank to handle it, maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate, and authorize foreign banks such as HSBC to handle it. Matters concerning the application for statutory foreign exchange for the import of essential goods to China will still be handled by the original review agencies. Therefore, the statutory foreign exchange will be permanently stable, that is, the US exchange rate will be 30 yuan and the British exchange rate will be one shilling and two and a half pence, and the black market foreign exchange will be stable for a long time. It will also prevent manipulation and speculation in the foreign exchange market, as well as the grabbing of foreign exchange by conspirators.

Wang Jun donated 2,000 yuan to the New Puyutang Donation

### The Spring Flower Show by Ainong

The 65th Spring Flower Show, organized by the Shanghai Flower Show, was held yesterday in the Grandstand Building. A flower-lined path happily led the author into the venue. The two large halls were arranged on the left and right. From the instructions on the wooden signs, I knew that the right hall was displaying table flower arrangements, etc., and the left hall was displaying flower piles, vegetables, etc. I stepped into the one on the right, because this one is the essence of the Flower Show.

As soon as I entered this hall, the first thing that caught my eye were two large flower mountains, standing against the wall, seemingly as imposing as the Four Heavenly Kings in a temple, attracting attention. The flowers on these two flower mountains were collected from the major parks of the Public Concession and arranged by Cao Desheng of Jiaozhou Park. The background was a blue cloth curtain, and the flowers of various colors were piled up in flower pots, colorful and dazzling. Yellow and red, white and green, purple and green reflected each other, setting each other off. The color arrangements were exceptionally bright, and the layers were arranged in an orderly manner, seeming to fill the eyes with an unspeakable pleasure.

The table settings occupied a large part of this hall, and this time there were many more, which can be divided into banquet style, home style, and tea style. Among them, the first prize for the banquet style was won by a table called "Fishing and Returning Home for a Big Feast." The tablecloth was made of fishnet, and a pot of water lilies and reeds was placed in the center, forming a waterscape. The table was completely filled with aquatic products, with a Western color, light, and ingenious, which was the characteristic of this table.

This time, Chinese member Zhou Shoujuan still participated with bonsai with Eastern sentiments and won the Cadu and Special Grand Prize trophies. According to the organizers, because the Peter Grand Silver Plaque had already been awarded to the Sichuanese exhibitor who stacked the flower mountains, and Mr. Zhou's products were really worthy of this trophy, he had no choice but to have the chairman and judge Mr. Cadu temporarily make a large silver cup to award to Mr. Zhou as a special award. Such special treatment was indeed a great honor. This time, the exhibits were still arranged on three tables, and still in their original positions. The table in the center was covered with a soft green and goose-yellow patterned brocade carpet, which was exceptionally eye-catching. In the center of the table was an old pot from the Ming Dynasty, planted with an old and rugged Gardenia, and an ancient Dharma statue sat next to the dragon-claw-like root nest, instantly feeling ancient. Next to it was a pot of agate pomegranates on a cliff, the bark was very old, but it was full of flowers, the flowers were large and the leaves were lush, which was especially rare. On the left was also a pot of Golden Jasmine on a cliff, with a fragrant fragrance. In front of it was a shallow ancient porcelain pot with wild bamboo, the leaves were green and lush, and the branches were straight and beautiful, which was especially energetic. There were also two pieces of Ling stone covered with green moss in a dry white water basin, and a boat was crossing between the stone walls, titled "Boating on the Spring Water is Like Sitting in the Sky," which was truly a masterpiece full of poetic and artistic charm. The table on the right was a small product, with various exquisite small ancient pots placed in the frame, planted with small holly, small elm trees, small gardenia, small roses, small crabapples, and small ivy, all of which were small but excellent, and could be played with in the palm of the hand. Among them, a two-and-a-half-inch oval pot was arranged into a bamboo forest thatched cottage, which was elegant and lovely. In this display cabinet, the colors were distinct and the arrangement was exquisite, creating a unique style in the show. Next to the frame was a Qinghua porcelain deep square pot, matched with a large Forsythia in the shape of a cliff, the posture was beautiful, which was rarely seen. An old Western gentleman saw it and humorously said to his friend, "I would like to make a will and be buried here after death." It can also be seen his old man's emotions of loving it as if it were alive.

After turning a corner, in the Western colors, the bonsai with Eastern sentiments appeared, which turned out to be Mr. Kong Zhiqing's product. Mr. Kong is a water and stone expert, so in his products, water and stone each accounted for half of the pot, and the arrangement was high and low. Among them, the one labeled "Purple Bamboo Forest" was the most simple and elegant. In a deep stone cave, there was a white stone statue of Guanyin, and a dragon-like ancient cypress was planted on the stone cave. The cave was full of purple bamboo. The pot was also pasted with ant-like labels, which turned out to be the "Heart Sutra" written by Wu Sheng Jushi, which made people feel the majesty of Buddhism. There was also a "Fishing Pleasure Picture," which was also eye-catching. In a shallow water basin, the stream was winding, and three boats were parked on the shore, like an ancient painting of a fisherman's paradise. There was also a "Fragrant Snow Sea," which was planted with more than ten Gardenias, which was many but not chaotic, and it was indeed rare. Moreover, the trees were full of white flowers, and a small stream ran across the trees, and a wooden bridge was built across the two banks, with thatched cottages lined up on both sides, full of rural flavor. There were about forty other small potted plants and water stones.

Turning to the large hall on the left again, there were three large piles of flowers, and large pots of regular grass flowers and other strange flowers and plants. Although they were very beautiful, they really didn't suit our taste, but they could attract the attention of Western ladies and gentlemen. As usual, there was a vegetable exhibition this year, but these fruits and vegetables that foreigners eat are naturally a mystery to me.

Walking out of the venue in this way, it had been a full three hours, but it seemed that there was still some residual fragrance on the nose, and a deep impression remained in the brain—the beauty of the East and the beauty of the West are, after all, different!

### French Concession Iron Gates Remain Closed, Nanshi Enters Lockdown, Those Unable to Return Home Bivouac in the Streets, Republic Road and Other Places Under Strict Search

Since the opening of the iron gates between the French Concession and Nanshi, the Japanese have intermittently closed them. Therefore, incidents of residents being blocked from entering or exiting have occurred from time to time. Recently, because a Japanese person was shot and killed, the Japanese side demanded that the authorities completely close all the iron gates and implement an emergency search. Although the Xinwen River iron gate was once opened to allow Nanshi residents working in the concession to return to Nanshi, from dawn yesterday, all the iron gates were again closed as before and remained closed all day. Thousands of residents were blocked inside and outside the iron gates. The details are recorded as follows:

Searching for the Murderer Yields No Results

According to yesterday's Japanese-language "Mainichi Shimbun," at 10:00 a.m. on the 24th, Kabashima Kikuji, the captain of the Nanshi Japanese Military Police, wearing plain clothes, was inspecting various locations in Nanshi. When he reached near the Daji Inn at No. 60 Jiucang Street, Nanshi, someone suddenly opened fire and shot at him. He was hit in the head by one bullet. Kabashima tried to chase the murderer, but due to his severe injuries, he died on the spot. The shooter took the opportunity to escape. According to eyewitnesses, the murderer was wearing Chinese clothing and there were three of them in total. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese Military Police immediately mobilized, cut off traffic, and searched for the murderer. The Japanese garrison and police from the Japanese Consulate conducted a major inspection, but no one has been found yet. Kabashima Kikuji was from Aichi Prefecture and participated in the Nanjing and Wuhan campaigns. He was transferred to his current position on October 1st of last year.

Iron Gates Closed, Traffic Not Restored

Also, it is reported that at 10:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, Kabashima Kikuji, the captain of the Nanshi Military Police, was shot and killed at the intersection of Fuyou Road and Jiucang Street in Nanshi. The Japanese immediately implemented special security measures, closing all iron gates connecting Nanshi and the French Concession, and dispatching large numbers of military police to conduct extensive searches within the boundary. Many residents who were stranded in Nanshi or the concession were unable to return home and had to sleep on the streets. The situation was quite tragic. According to reporters' inquiries, traffic between Nanshi and the French Concession had not yet been restored as of last night. The Xinwen River, Xiaobeimen, Nanyang Bridge, Xie Bridge, Hongqiao, Tushan and other iron gates remained closed.

Strict Inspections Cause Anxiety

Furthermore, it was learned that there was a large-scale search in areas such as Republic Road yesterday. Residents were subjected to very strict questioning if there was an increase or decrease in the number of people in their households. Residents at the scene of the incident were forced to leave their homes to conduct thorough searches. The main roads of Nanshi were densely patrolled by military police, monitoring pedestrians. The situation in the former lockdown area of ​​West Shanghai has reappeared in Nanshi. Ordinary residents are panicked and feel uneasy. Yesterday, the Japanese troops stationed at the Xie Bridge iron gate once agreed to release the Nanshi residents stranded in the French Concession, but those who wanted to leave Nanshi were all prohibited. It is said that this traffic blockade will continue for three days, but this has not yet been confirmed. Due to the traffic blockade, the supply of vegetables in the French Concession has decreased, and prices have soared.

Nanshi Lockdown, Vegetable Prices Soar

Those most affected are those who live in Nanshi but work in the concession, as they are unable to work or return home. There are no fewer than thousands of them. Therefore, inside and outside the iron gates, people are crowded all day long, watching the situation. The next is the vegetable farmers in Nanshi, who usually come to the concession to sell their produce. Yesterday, they could not do so as they wished, resulting in a sharp decrease in the number of vegetable stalls in the concession, and the selling price increased accordingly. This was especially true for bean sprouts, with this type of vegetable mostly germinated in Nanshi. (What usually sells for 10 cents has doubled or more). As for local goods (greens, chives, broad beans, etc.), they could not be transported out of Nanshi, but fortunately they could arrive from Beishi, so the price only increased by 40-50%.

Arrested Dancer Taken to Hongkou

The Japanese, together with the French Concession police, arrested dancer Wang Juanjuan at No. 19, Lane 138, West Gate Road on the 22nd. The reason for her arrest is said to be that someone accused her of absconding, while others suspect her of being a spy, so the truth is difficult to know. A reporter from the Datong News Agency learned this morning that the arrested dancer Wang Juanjuan was handed over to the Japanese side yesterday after being detained at the French Concession police station and taken to Hongkou.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Decides to Issue a New Public Bond of 9 Million Yuan, with a Face Value Guaranteed by Amusement Venue Taxes, Divided into Five Types with an Annual Interest Rate of 6%

Principal will be redeemed by lottery every six months until all debts are cleared by the end of 1951. The first interest payment date is set for December 31 of this year. The first principal redemption lottery is scheduled to be held in June next year. This public bond will be guaranteed by the license fees of amusement venues, entertainment taxes, franchise operating fees for public utilities, as well as the Council's general assets and income. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation will be responsible for the trust of bondholders. The Council is scheduled to publicly issue the bonds at the Public Bond Bank Share Department of the Finance Department at No. 209 Jiangxi Road from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. on the 28th of this month. Subscribers can obtain application forms from the Finance Department. Details can be found in the Council's announcement on this (26th) day.

May 30th Anniversary, Traffic as Usual

Since the police authorities of the two concessions adopted joint defense in May, each anniversary has passed safely, and social security has also benefited significantly. According to a statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, the number of criminal cases that occurred last week has decreased to 340, which is 34 fewer than the previous week, and 396 criminals have been arrested. This good result is very satisfactory and the best this year. As for the anniversary on the 30th of this month, in addition to taking ordinary precautionary measures, because the arrangements are meticulous, the border roads will not be blocked.

### Japanese Toa Shipping Company Seizes the Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Rights, Naruto Maru Docks in Shanghai Awaiting Trial Voyage, But Has Not Yet Been Approved by the Japanese Navy

The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route has been suspended for nearly a year since the Japanese Navy announced the blockade of the coastal ports of eastern Zhejiang in July last year. Since the area was occupied by the Japanese army, shipping companies in Shanghai have sought to resume shipping. China Merchants, China Central, and the Japanese Toa Shipping Company competed for the shipping rights, and now the Toa Shipping Company has obtained them, and thus dispatched the Naruto Maru, which operates on the Yangtze River route, to operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The ship first entered the Jiangnan Shipyard dock to inspect the hull and repaint it. Now the work has been completed. On the 22nd of the month it left the dock at 5 o'clock to test the engine, and is now docked at buoy Nos. 28 and 29, awaiting orders to sail to Ningbo. It was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo yesterday without passengers or cargo. Once the trial voyage is successful, a formal voyage will be scheduled. The manager of the company's Ningbo branch, a Japanese person, also took the ship to Ningbo to arrange everything, but until yesterday evening at around 7 o'clock, the ship was still docked at buoy Nos. 18 and 29, and there was no sign of raising anchor. It is likely that the trial voyage has been rescheduled. According to the company, the Naruto Maru is scheduled to test the Shanghai-Ningbo route within the next few days, but the Japanese Navy authorities have not yet approved the passage, so it is difficult to determine whether it can officially operate.

Three Bandits Rob a Car

At around 11:40 the night before last, two men went to the branch of Taylor Taxi Company on Lahmersdorf Road to rent a car. The station dispatched car No. 1219, driven by driver Wang Changgen. At the request of the passengers, they drove to Chengdu Road. When they arrived at the entrance of Xiudexincun Lane on that road, the passengers ordered Wang to stop the car. Then three people entered the lane in succession. Not long after, they took a man and got into the car together, ordering Wang to drive west. Unexpectedly, when they reached Zhangjiazhai Road on Aiwenyi Road, the passengers in the car suddenly showed fierce eyes. The bandit sitting next to Wang immediately took out a gun and threatened Wang, forcibly driving him out of the car, and driving away.

### Educational News: Relief Funds of 1.4 Million Yuan Fully Disbursed; Education Authorities Announce Implementation Process; All Teachers and Staff in the City are Extremely Moved

(Hua She) The Executive Yuan allocated 1.4 million yuan for relief funds to teachers and staff in Shanghai, which has now been fully disbursed. All teachers and staff in private registered or approved specialized schools above the college level, as well as public and private registered or approved primary and secondary schools, have received universal relief. Although the amount received by each individual is small due to the large number of recipients, it still provides a small benefit. More importantly, it offers spiritual comfort. The teachers and staff in Shanghai are deeply moved that the central government, at a time when national finances are primarily focused on military needs, was still able to allocate funds for relief, demonstrating its concern for education in Shanghai and its benevolence towards the literati. A reporter from Da Hua She, in order to understand the implementation process of this matter, yesterday specially visited the authorities stationed in Shanghai under the Ministry of Education and received the following statement:

The Executive Yuan Approved the Allocation of 800,000 Yuan

After the war, prices in Shanghai soared endlessly. Since last autumn, the cost of living index has exceeded eight times the previous level. The salaries of teachers and staff in various schools were barely enough to survive. Everyone sought ways to provide relief. The party and government in this city, in addition to requesting the central government to allocate living subsidies for teachers and staff in public schools, also strictly ordered each school to make its finances public, ensuring that every penny of the school's income was used to improve the salaries of teachers and staff. Furthermore, schools were allowed to appropriately increase tuition fees to provide financial support, and the distribution standards for these increased tuition fees were clearly defined, requiring that 70% be used for the salaries of teachers and staff. Subsequently, public opinion launched a million-dollar relief campaign, appealing to the government to allocate one million yuan to assist teachers and staff in Shanghai. They also painstakingly recounted the hardships and struggles of Shanghai's teachers and staff over the past four years and the current state of their suffering, strongly requesting Minister of Education Chen to grant relief. This was then forwarded to the President for submission to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval, allocating 800,000 yuan in relief funds. When the news arrived, everyone was overjoyed. This is the origin of the 800,000 yuan relief fund.

The Executive Yuan Approved an Additional Allocation of 600,000 Yuan

After the Executive Yuan approved the 800,000 yuan relief fund, the Shanghai education administration immediately began investigation and statistical work to serve as a basis for future distribution. All public and private schools at all levels that applied for relief were included. After a month of work, the statistics were completed and reported to the Ministry of Education. Subsequently, due to the large number of teachers and staff, it was felt that 800,000 yuan, although a large sum, was still insufficient for distribution. Reluctantly, the reasons were again painstakingly explained, and Minister Chen was telegraphed to forward a request to the Executive Yuan for an additional allocation of 600,000 yuan. Fortunately, the education authorities quickly approved the request. This is the origin of the additional allocation of 600,000 yuan.

Distribution Principles and Amounts

After the additional allocation of 600,000 yuan was approved, the education administration, following the Ministry's instructions, invited relevant party and government personnel to jointly discuss the distribution methods. After repeated discussions, the following principles were determined: (1) Following the Ministry's instructions, 295,500 yuan was allocated for relief funds for teachers and staff in private specialized schools above the college level, to be directly distributed by the Ministry; (2) Following the Ministry's instructions, 136,000 yuan was allocated for relief funds for teachers and staff in schools that had moved to Shanghai from Jiangsu Province, and later an additional 15,000 yuan was allocated, both to be directly distributed by the Jiangsu Provincial authorities stationed in Shanghai; (3) The remaining funds would be used to provide universal relief to public and private registered or approved primary and secondary schools in Shanghai, as well as public vocational and supplementary schools, and short-term primary schools and people's schools, etc., that had submitted applications, based on the number of classes, teachers and staff, and students in each school. However, the distribution standards for public schools were higher than those for private schools, because the application for living subsidies for public schools had been approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry, and the relief funds would be disbursed accordingly. As for the distribution standards for middle and primary schools, there were also differences due to the varying number of teachers and staff required for each class in middle and primary schools, but they still adhered to the principle of fairness. In total, the amount distributed, excluding the 546,500 yuan for specialized schools above the college level and schools that had moved to Shanghai from Jiangsu Province, was 853,500 yuan for various schools in Shanghai. The amounts received by each sector of schools were as follows: (1) Public secondary schools: 99,000 yuan; (2) Public primary schools: 185,400 yuan; (3) Supplementary schools, short-term primary schools, and people's schools: 67,000 yuan; (4) Private secondary schools: 290,400 yuan; (5) Private primary schools: 198,000 yuan, totaling 839,800 yuan. The remaining 12,700 yuan will be temporarily used as a reserve fund and reported to the Ministry of Education for instructions on how to handle it. All receipts and forms will also be submitted to the Ministry of Education for review.

All Funds Disbursed in Three Installments

The large sum of relief funds was received in batches. On May 12, the first batch of relief funds, 800,000 yuan, was received. After deducting 531,500 yuan for specialized schools above the college level and schools that had moved to Shanghai from Jiangsu Province, there was a remaining 268,500 yuan, which was barely enough for the initial disbursement to public schools. Originally, it was intended to disburse all funds at once after the entire amount had arrived. However, due to the urgent need for relief from the various schools, delay was not permissible, and the disbursement procedures were also extremely troublesome, making it impossible to disburse all funds at the same time. Therefore, rather than disbursing them together later, it was decided to disburse them as soon as funds were received. Thus, the public school portion was disbursed first. Subsequently, on May 18, an additional 300,000 yuan was received. After allocating an additional 15,000 yuan to schools that had moved to Shanghai from Jiangsu Province, it was sufficient to disburse to private middle schools. The disbursement was then continued. On May 22, another 300,000 yuan was received, and private primary schools and other sectors were disbursed. At this point, the disbursement process was completely concluded. The time between each disbursement and the day the funds were received was no more than three days, in accordance with the original intention of disbursing as soon as funds were received.

Appreciating the Benevolence and Strengthening Loyalty

In summary, in this large-scale relief effort, striving for fairness in principle was relatively easy, but ensuring that there were no discrepancies between each school was extremely difficult in practice. This point should be understood by the teachers and staff. As for the distribution standards for each school, they also varied according to the circumstances, making it difficult to establish a uniform standard. Therefore, a uniform standard was not established, and each school's principal, in consultation with the teachers and staff, decided on a standard based on fairness and reasonableness. All relief funds were completely distributed to the teachers and staff to provide support. Reviewing the implementation process of this matter, it was extremely complex and took half a year to complete. If it were not for President Chiang's deep concern and Minister Chen's leadership, there would not have been such a satisfactory result. The assistance provided by party and government comrades in this city was also greatly appreciated. The diligence and dedication of the staff were also commendable. It is hoped that all teachers and staff in the city will appreciate the central government's benevolence, continue to uphold the spirit of the past, strengthen their loyalty, work hard in their positions, and fulfill their missions, so that the future of the nation will truly rely on them.

Professor Yao Ke Lectures on Drama and Education

The academic lecture series initiated by the eight elders of the Shanghai academic community held its fourth lecture yesterday at the Swen Palace Theater. Professor Yao Ke lectured on drama and education, first explaining the concept of drama and education. The main idea was that all art is propaganda, and drama is an important tool for propaganda and a weapon for public education. The Chinese public has always received education from drama, so using drama as an educational tool is not a new idea. In modern China, illiteracy is rampant, and the promotion of public education is urgent. Therefore, drama education is extremely important. He then explained the value of drama education, saying that it can assist and supplement public education because (1) it is more difficult for older illiterate people to read; (2) reading and literacy are relatively boring, while drama is more interesting; (3) textbook education is abstract and indirect, while drama is concrete and direct. He then gave an overview of drama education in various countries, such as the Moscow Children's Theater and the drama group of the American Works Progress Administration, etc., saying that the results were excellent. He also said that China could take advantage of folk customs such as welcoming gods and temple fairs to achieve great results, because welcoming gods is a nationwide movement and the countryside lacks other forms of entertainment, which can be guided and improved. Finally, he elaborated on the points to be noted when organizing drama education, including (1) talent; (2) organization; (3) attention must be paid to the active participation of the public; (4) educational materials must be found from the real-life needs of the public (such as legends), novels, folk songs, social stories, etc.; (5) mass movements must be organized, etc. It was also learned that the next lecture is planned to be given by Mr. Xi Yushu.

### The Impact of the European War on British Banking Operations Translated by Ling Chongzhen

What becomes of the banking industry during wartime? What responsibilities does it shoulder? Although our banking professionals have tasted the flavors of war for about two and a half years, it seems this question remains largely unknown. Reading this article and reflecting on our own country, especially Shanghai, one cannot help but be astonished that this question remains unanswered to this day. Frankly speaking, in theory, this issue should be "beyond discussion" and not even raised. Yet, it still seems necessary to bring it up. How can we simply dismiss it with "this is that"? What lessons should this article teach us? Hopefully, readers will not have differing opinions on this matter. (Editor)

At the start of the war, the British government took various actions in all areas, and they were especially prepared for any contingency in the banking system. This is not an exaggeration, as there are numerous facts to prove it. As the war crisis gradually became apparent in 1938, the British banking sector immediately assembled a delegation to discuss ways to respond to all possible events. Looking at the plans contributed by this delegation today, after the war has been going on for eighteen months, they appear even more sound and comprehensive. At the beginning of the war with Germany, the future progress was difficult to predict, so all plans had to consider the worst-case scenarios. Fortunately, until today, only a small portion of these plans have needed to be implemented.

In terms of the practical operations of the national bank's head office and its branches, two anticipated difficulties were the possibility of transportation disruptions and the destruction of records due to bombings. As for the large-scale conscription of male staff, this was also expected, and mechanical replacements for manpower were already in place to compensate.

Operating Normally During Bombings

The head offices of the five major British banks are all in London, and in peacetime, it takes each employee an hour to travel to and from the office. Predictably, the targets of German bombings were concentrated on London's transportation lines, so many transportation stations and lines were frequently threatened and temporarily suspended. Bank office hours were changed to 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM on Saturdays and Sundays, while still figuring out ways to ensure that employees could arrive at the office on time.

Opinions varied regarding the best way to ensure that employees could arrive at the office on time, and one method is now being implemented. The head offices of the banks and the Bank of England are all bomb-proof buildings. Some bank employees who hold the keys live inside, and proper arrangements are made to provide them with food. They also take turns staying there, so that each employee can go home once every few nights to spend time with their family. Another method is to rent passenger cars to transport employees directly to and from work. These cars depart from various locations in London and the suburbs and arrive in the city before 9:00 AM every morning, and then return the employees home after the day's work is done.

Both of these methods are quite comprehensive, but the cost is inevitably high. The banks spend as much as one pound per week for each employee, whether they commute daily or stay in the office, but only this way can it be guaranteed that every essential male and female employee can be at their post on time.

As for branches in London and the provinces, so far there has been no need to implement such measures, as most employees live nearby and can get to work on time.

Maintaining the Check Clearing Function

What the banking delegation had to carefully consider was the issue of check clearing after the outbreak of war. Regarding this point, the steps they decided upon can be described as the most novel actions in history, namely, to move the London Clearing House to Stoke-on-Trent, which is 146 miles away from London, except for the check clearing equipment of the head offices and one or two other banks near the Bank of England (which is stored in the basement of the Bank of England).

This relocation was carried out with the most comprehensive organization, and there were no delays or obstacles in action. On a Saturday and Sunday after the start of the war, the London Clearing House temporarily closed to allow all equipment and tools, including seven hundred adding machines (Odding Macoine), to be moved to the new site, ready to resume operations the following Monday. The entire process was well-organized, and all parties involved were satisfied.

The inconvenience caused by the relocation of the London Clearing House was far less than expected. The entire record of each transaction was printed in duplicate by machine. In addition, other modern methods were used so that even if deposit checks were lost in transit, the business could still be processed immediately. Although the receipts were delayed by two or three days, causing a slight delay in customers' depositing of checks, the banks did not feel any inconvenience, and there were no other negative points except for the addition of some items under the transportation figures in the bank statements.

Bombings Cannot Stop Business Operations

While check clearing is guaranteed by the use of machines, the widespread application of other machines in the past decade has achieved other important results. It is a well-known fact that many bank branches in London and the countryside have been bombed, but to date, there has been no report of a bombed branch closing for the entire day.

Copies of seals and signatures have long been stored in safe locations; copies of all transaction records are also available at any time. When a branch is bombed, it will continue to operate the next day in the nearest branch or in a branch of another bank. Therefore, no matter how large the material losses, British banking operations continue as usual.

There is a rather strange fact that I would like to mention here, that is, although the buildings of most bank branches have been destroyed, the safe deposit boxes and underground strongrooms are completely unharmed. Sometimes, due to the rupture of water pipes, these underground strongrooms, which store customers' valuable securities, title deeds, and the bank's cash and important records, are occasionally flooded, but to date, there have been no reports of damage to these securities and title deeds.

Filling Vacancies After Staff Enlistment

At the time of writing this article, approximately twenty percent of the male staff of British banks have voluntarily or been conscripted into the army, and therefore cannot work as usual. If it were not for the development of machinery in recent years and the gradual reduction in the number of young bank employees, the number of employees who have had to leave their posts due to the war would have been even more considerable.

The vacancies left by the enlisted staff are filled half by young people aged sixteen or seventeen and half by women. Many female employees who previously resigned due to marriage have agreed to return to work during the war, so the actual number of bank employees now is not much different from before. Most women with general experience in banking operations are assigned to teller positions, and they are quite competent. In most branches, the teller work includes various different banking transactions, so it is not easy to handle without specially trained personnel.

Fundamental Changes and Special Measures

The fundamental change in banking operations brought about by this war is the virtual elimination of all foreign exchange transactions. Exchange rates no longer exist, and all transactions must go through the Bank of England, which has the right to decide whether each transfer of funds is beneficial to the country. Therefore, the foreign exchange departments of the banks in London have temporarily closed, and all the skilled personnel dismissed as a result have been reassigned to other important positions. In practice, British banks have implemented the dispersion of skilled personnel in various departments within the country so that in the event of an accident, there are skilled personnel to manage everything.

Major banks with main operations in London have prepared suitable premises so that they can be relocated immediately if the office cannot be used. These backup premises are basements with modern air conditioning equipment and absolutely safe locations, which can be moved into in the event of an accident. In fact, the banks' infrequently used records have already been moved in to ensure safety.

The amount of lending during the war has been greatly reduced, as expected. The supply of credit is limited to channels that are beneficial to the country's war effort. The nature of bank loans has changed. Loans secured by valuable securities in clearing transactions have been largely repaid, and many commercial activities have contracted due to the war, so the demand for credit has also greatly decreased.

The issuance of new valuable securities has been suspended for a long time. The banks are working closely with the National Supply Department and the Aviation Machinery Manufacturing Department to oversee all matters related to credit loans for working capital, raw materials, machine tools, and other needs.

For example, when a weapons manufacturing plant needs funds, it can apply to the general manager of the local bank. The National Supply Department and the Aviation Machinery Manufacturing Department have designated divisions to maintain close contact with the banks. When an application is received, a contract is immediately issued and given to the borrower. These two departments have great authority, and poorly managed factories can be closed down and taken over by representatives appointed by the two departments or the banks issuing credit loans.

The amount of credit loans issued by the banks has been greatly increased by government order to meet the needs of the national war effort. Therefore, in addition to direct loans to the government, the total amount of credit loans issued to private industries is considerable. Fortunately, all bank operators understand that striving for victory in the war is the primary goal. Private savings have been transformed into various valuable securities issued by the government, and the excess profits tax has reached 100%. This step seems unavoidable. The 100% profits tax promulgated at the beginning of the war was a major political move, but private businesses have felt increasingly difficult as a result. Therefore, from an economic point of view, this is actually an unlimited obstacle.

Of course, the government's weekly war expenses far exceed the amount of public bonds purchased by the public. The way to make up for this is for the Ministry of Finance to borrow directly from the banks, with so-called Treasury Deposit Receipts as collateral, the total amount of which is currently approximately £250,000,000 to £300,000,000, with an interest rate of 11/8%. In view of the entire British banking deposit capacity, this amount cannot be considered very large, but the banks naturally welcome the government's plan to raise funds for repayment and higher interest rates to reduce their losses. The increase in these deposit receipts has increased the proportion of low-yielding assets in the banks, causing concern.

The National Savings Committee is working hard to encourage the public to save as much as possible to support the government's war effort. The organization of this committee is quite similar to the American Liberty Loan Organizations during the last World War. The banks are a strong support, and the managers and staff of the banks in various cities in England spend most of their time working on this.

As for the banking industry's generous and patriotic attitude towards the war of resistance, it can be further demonstrated by their treatment of staff serving in the military. The salaries of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force are very low. For example, a single soldier receives only five jiao per day. Although those with wives and other dependents receive some subsidies, the amount is also very limited. To solve this salary problem, the banks decided to supplement the salaries of all staff serving in the military to make them equal to their salaries in the bank. In addition, the employee can also receive family subsidies from the government, so that the staff serving in the military can be at ease without worrying about their families, while also knowing that their positions in the bank will still be maintained after the war. For the banks, it does increase a lot of burden, but they see it as a contribution they should make to the country.

In short, the British banking industry is facing the war with a strong and calm attitude. War and the various losses and destruction it brings are not welcomed by them, but since the war has arrived, they know that they must fulfill their duties to the fullest. Bank clients and customers are also able to cooperate fully, and have never complained about the shortening of office hours and other inconveniences. In a nutshell, the public's general attitude is: "Since we are all suffering the same fate, we must work together to make the best possible outcome." (Translated from The Burroughs Clearing House Fed. 1941)

### Third Phase Style YQ

After Japan adopted a uniform military currency and clamped down on other newly issued banknotes, the Sino-Japanese currency war seems to have eased on the surface. In reality, however, it has simply moved the battlefield from the currency realm to the price realm. This can be said to be the beginning of the third phase of the Sino-Japanese currency war. The past two phases were all active in the currency realm. The first phase focused on substituting legal tender with other currencies, such as the Allied banknotes. After this strategy failed, they shifted their focus to undermining the purchasing power of legal tender. Today, the goal of undermining legal tender in the price realm remains consistent, but the means of destruction are still limited to currency. Attempts to seize foreign exchange, like the "Huaxing Notes" attempt to "live and die together" with legal tender! This is the second phase. When it designated Central China as a "military currency circulation area" and reversed its "substitution" policy by not supporting other miscellaneous banknotes, Japan's monetary strategy towards China no longer launched frontal attacks on legal tender, but instead began its indirect, roundabout strategy from the price perspective. Now, it is in the period of trying out this strategy; this is something everyone should pay special attention to.

Although rising prices are not the result of the devaluation of legal tender, the result of rising prices is the devaluation of legal tender. This is a recognized fact. China's legal tender has a strong foundation and is backed by the pound sterling and US dollar. Therefore, directly undermining the purchasing power of legal tender is futile. Moreover, since it tasted the sweetness of seizing legal tender foreign exchange funds, it reversed its attitude of fearing the depreciation of the legal tender exchange rate and instead became "afraid that the legal tender exchange rate is not high enough." Therefore, on the one hand, it hopes to maintain the legal tender exchange rate at a higher level in order to seize it. On the other hand, it still attempts to suppress the purchasing power of legal tender so that it can gain an occupation right over the Chinese monetary system. In these two conflicting attempts, this roundabout strategy of attacking from the price perspective was discovered.

Japan discovered this strategy unexpectedly. At first, it only wanted to control materials in the occupied territories to supplement its own shortages. On the one hand, it used force to control the circulation of materials in the occupied territories. On the other hand, it issued military currency and other miscellaneous banknotes to obtain these materials without paying a price. Merchants in the occupied territories, intimidated by the threat of force, mostly compensated for their losses by raising prices. This created a situation where military currency and other currencies depreciated sharply against legal tender. In order to save the devaluation of military currency and other currencies, and to satisfy its desire to fully purchase materials in the occupied territories, it began to raise the price of military currency. Sacrificing the Japanese yen notes in China, sacrificing various affiliated miscellaneous banknotes, expanding the opportunity for compulsory circulation of military currency, and even deliberately creating speculation in military currency, all aimed at raising the price of military currency.

Although the attempt to expand the opportunity for compulsory circulation of military currency still failed, the means of deliberately creating speculation in military currency was extremely subtle. It created a situation of soaring military currency prices to attract those unscrupulous speculators. On the one hand, it played tricks in the speculative frenzy of soaring and plummeting prices, so that military currency, which could not compete with legal tender, actually had periods of being more expensive than legal tender, and then tried to prop up that kind of situation. The greater the degree of soaring and plummeting, the greater the possibility of attracting speculation. The more speculators attracted, the greater the possibility of military currency issuance, and the more legal tender was absorbed by it. Therefore, although the circulation range of military currency is still pitifully narrow, with the increase in the amount of legal tender it has seized, it can promote the rise in prices of materials in the occupied territories. With rising prices, the purchasing power of legal tender is invisibly reduced. It can instead obtain more materials in the rise in military currency prices, while avoiding affecting the possibility of legal tender appreciation restricting its seizure of legal tender foreign exchange.

### Seen, Heard, Thought

Textiles are the lifeline of Japan's national economy. However, its cotton almost entirely depends on the United States. Last Saturday, the US Senate authorized the Commercial Credit Corporation to buy cotton, and also prohibited all commercial transactions of cotton until after the war. This is tantamount to expanding the scope of the embargo against Japan. The giant hand holding Japan's throat has added another layer of strength.

Speaking of the stakes of the textile industry in Japan's national economy, I am reminded of what I said in the past: This Sino-Japanese War can be regarded as a "Cotton War" in economic terms. The first factory opened by the first Japanese person in China was a yarn factory. The Japanese commodity that has been most vigorously marketed to China is cotton cloth. After the September 18th Incident, Japan loudly advocated "Japanese industry, Chinese agriculture," with the intention of China closing yarn factories and having Chinese farmers grow cotton for Japanese factories. Because China did not agree, Japan took action itself. At the beginning of the January 28th Shanghai War, Sanyou Industrial Company was burned down. At that time, it was the most active member of the Chinese cotton industry. The company later rebuilt in Hangzhou and the extremely popular Triangle brand towels were produced by the factory. But in this war, the first thing the Japanese army did when it arrived in Hangzhou was to seize the factory, forcing the company to switch to selling Sanyou Buwan. When this war broke out, it was the time when the Sino-Japanese yarn industry competition was at its fiercest. Most of the Chinese yarn factories in North China have changed to Japanese nationality. The Shenxin mortgage incident in Shanghai caused a stir in the city. Since the outbreak of the war, the industry in the occupied territories that has suffered the most is yarn factories. Even British yarn factories were not spared. Like the suddenly popular Lun Chang ramie yarn due to the war, it was soon caught in a labor dispute with a background and found itself in a dilemma. In the occupied territories, the first material to be controlled was cotton. The first step of China's anti-blockade policy in the Northwest was to prohibit cotton planting and ban the export of cotton. Now Japanese merchants are trying to replace Double Horse yarn with blue cloth yarn, but the disguised cotton export ban this time by the United States is enough to give the Japanese textile tycoons a headache.

Rice weevils are injecting air needles into the rice market again. They are expanding the "purchase and transport" air to offset the "originating from foreign rice" fact. I hope colleagues and citizens will pay attention and I also hope the concession authorities will plan ahead to manage the movement of rice to maintain the current successful rice price policy.

Laymen don't know how to pick goods, so they worship old brands; people in business, therefore, only ask about brands. However, the so-called old brand is nothing more than sticking to conventions and being complacent. It is indeed better than new brands that are slippery and deceptive, but it does not necessarily include the element of continuous improvement. Therefore, worshiping old brands is simply worshiping stagnation.

### Finance Banks in Chongqing Increase and Implement Full-Day Saturday Operations

Chongqing News, There are currently 30 member banks of the Chongqing Banking Association, including the Salt Industry Bank. There are eight or nine banks that have not joined the association. There are many newly established banks. Those that have already opened include the Jianguo Bank. Those in preparation include the County Township Bank General Office, the Yangtze Industrial Bank, the Fuxing Industrial Bank, the Social Welfare Bank, the Chengdu Commercial Bank, and the Citizen Bank. This proves the vitality of finance in the rear. The four banks in Chongqing—Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China—and various commercial banks have, in accordance with the resolutions of the four banks' general offices, implemented full-day operations on Saturdays since mid-April.

Yarn and Flowers American Cotton Purchases Increased and Prices Rose, Indian Cotton Long Positions Closed, Soft

New York Cotton Market, initially due to the news of the Senate passing the Smith Act, prices rose due to mass purchases, and then softened after entering the market. The closing result was an increase or decrease of one to two pounds compared to the previous day.

Bombay Cotton Market, initially due to speculative purchases and good news from American cotton, prices rose. Then, due to long positions closing and brokers selling, prices fell back. The closing result was an increase or decrease of one to five compared to the previous day. Seventy-five, the forecast price has not been reached.

Another telegram, statistics of Indian cotton from September 1, last year to May 24 this year are recorded on the left (per bale of four hundred pounds).

Final Revised Report on American Cotton

Washington Telegram, The US Department of Agriculture Cotton Production Statistics Bureau released the final revised report on American cotton last year as follows (cotton field units in thousands of acres, cotton units in thousands of bales).

North-South Goods Cinnamon is Relatively Tight

Cinnamon has been relatively scarce in small sizes recently, so while the market price for large sizes has repeatedly softened, small sizes have tended to tighten. The current market price, such as Tianhong’s sales of 140 yuan, is now quoted at 150 yuan.

Seafood Shark Fin Prices are Firm and High

Shark fins have been scarce in stock recently, and the market situation is very firm and high. Net jade knot fins require 4,600 yuan, and the rest range from over 3,000 yuan to over 1,000 yuan. Even lower-grade small fins require 260 yuan.

Miscellaneous News Old Mold Has Been Pervasive Recently, Cigarette Stockpilers Seek to Get Rid of Stock

The cigarette market situation these days is as dull as a wooden chicken. Because exports require export permits, plus high costs such as expenses, it is not profitable to ship to the inland, so sales are unusually sluggish. Only this street has a slight interest. The market inventory is worlds apart from sales. The mold season is in full swing, and stockpilers are seeking to get rid of stock. People's minds are weak and depressed, causing the market to present a spiraling situation. The dark market price is 1,296 yuan for the Great Britain brand, 666 yuan for the Small Fairy brand, and 671 yuan for the Five Star brand, without much gain or loss. 928 yuan for the Old Knife brand, because of its widespread sales, the price is not easy to be small. 12,295 yuan per 10,000 for fifty Great Britain brand cigarettes, 13,380 yuan per 10,000 for fifty Daqianmen brand cigarettes, and 13,378 yuan per 10,000 for ten Daqianmen brand cigarettes. The Jinshu and Meili brands have stabilized in the market, and sales have also been sluggish.

Medicinal Materials Anemarrhena Has Been Shipped Slightly

Several pieces of Anemarrhena have recently been shipped from the north. The goods are still good, but the customer's asking price is too high, so the market's counter-offer is thirty or forty yuan apart, resulting in no transaction. However, the customer still does not want to sell, resulting in a stalemate.

Hardware Wire Nails Have Fallen Again

Wire nails from this factory are oversupplied in this street. Stockpilers have been constantly releasing stock, resulting in softening. The market price has fallen again and again. The recent asking price in the market is only 160 yuan per bucket, which is more than 10 yuan lower than the previous market. The only way out for these goods (the South Seas Islands) is currently lacking in procurement methods, so very little is being shipped. And the various places in North China are also intermittently interrupted. The Yangtze River inland gangs rarely embellish, and the users of the construction gangs in this street have limited stomachs, resulting in market stagnation.

### Youth Health Preservation Methods

— Gong Chang

The period of youth is one of vigorous development and also the most dangerous time in life. The length of one's life, the strength of the body, and the success or failure of one's career are all determined during this period. Therefore, health preservation during youth is especially important. Now, I will briefly list several methods of health preservation below:

1.  The skin should get plenty of sunlight. One should rub the whole body with cold water daily, and wear less clothing to develop a habit of cold resistance.

2.  The lungs should take a deep breath every morning to prevent lung disease. The doors and windows of the room should be kept open day and night to circulate the air.

3.  The muscles should be accustomed to labor. One should regularly engage in various sports to increase muscle development. One should also correct spinal curvature, paying particular attention to sitting and standing posture.

4.  The digestive system must develop good habits. One should not eat snacks in between the three meals a day. One should not overeat, but chew carefully. Brush your teeth and scrape your tongue once each morning and evening. Have a bowel movement once a day at a fixed time (preferably in the morning). If constipated, eat fruits such as bananas and pears.

5.  One should abstain from smoking and alcohol. Cigarettes and alcohol contain toxic substances that can invade the brain, heart, blood, etc., numbing their functions and corrupting their essence. It is imperative to abstain from them.

6.  One should refrain from gambling. Gambling is an improper behavior that can cultivate a侥幸 and dissolute habit in one's spirit. It causes great harm to the body, time, and economy. All young people should absolutely abstain from it.

7.  The reproductive desire of youth is most vigorous. The semen produced by the external kidneys contains something called "丕耳明," which is not only for the purpose of human reproduction, but also for developing brainpower, physical strength, and the functions of internal organs such as the heart, lungs, stomach, intestines, liver, and kidneys. However, young people often do not know its preciousness, shaking it, wasting it, exhausting it, and committing the disease of masturbation. This disease can be called chronic suicide. Especially on this wicked island, it is easiest to be tempted by various influences and commit this disease, giving one's entire life the greatest blow. All young people, do not commit this, otherwise, the future is in danger!

There are countless methods of health preservation for young people. Today, I will only mention a few, hoping that young people will take good care of themselves.

### A Kind of Economical, Convenient, and Hygienic Shoe

— Zhi

In the current environment, I feel that everything we have—in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation—should meet three conditions: economy, convenience, and hygiene. However, these three conditions are not easy to achieve. Often, what is economical is inconvenient, and what is convenient is unhygienic. It is extremely difficult to achieve perfection.

Now, I feel that a type of shoe can precisely meet these three conditions. Speaking it out, it is not that strange: cloth shoes. When it comes to shoes, they can be divided into three types: leather shoes, cloth shoes, and rubber shoes. Among these three types, leather shoes are the most expensive. A pair of ordinary goods always costs more than thirty yuan. Although they are sturdy, they can only be used for two years at most. Moreover, leather is not breathable. Wearing leather shoes for a long time can easily cause dampness and toxins. Not to mention that the raw materials for leather shoes are mostly imported! Secondly, talking about cloth shoes, there are three types of cloth shoes: silk-faced, woolen-faced, and cloth-faced. The soles are made of leather, cloth, felt, etc. In terms of lightness, leather soles are definitely the best. In terms of moisture absorption, felt and cloth soles are the best. In terms of durability, felt and cloth soles are not inferior to leather soles. As for rubber shoes, although they can be used in both sunny and rainy weather, they seem to be more convenient. However, they are not breathable, and the dampness is very serious. After wearing them for a day, when you take them off at night, the soles of the socks are often as if they have been soaked in water, which is most unsuitable for hygiene. Putting all of this together, cloth shoes are the most suitable. However, if we look at the general people in society today, they all like to wear leather shoes, especially young people. Of course, young people's aesthetic thinking is relatively developed, which is not to be blamed. However, in this time of serious national crisis, how can we bear to not be more frugal? Therefore, I hope that everyone will wear more cloth shoes that are economical, convenient, and conducive to hygiene.

### Should We Drink Tea?

— Xi Xia

The habit of "drinking tea" is extremely common in our country's society. At home, when there is nothing to do, we drink tea to relieve our worries. We serve tea to guests as a courtesy, and even in remote villages, there are "tea houses." From this, we can see how popular it is. However, opinions vary regarding the effect of drinking tea on the body. Those who love tea believe that tea can help food digestion and promote the effectiveness of food utilization, so they advocate drinking tea. Opponents believe that tea contains "tannic acid," which can cause protein to coagulate and prevent the absorption of nitrogen. Since it is harmful and wasteful, they advocate drinking plain boiled water and oppose drinking tea. Everyone holds their own opinion, making it impossible for the general public to determine who is right and who is wrong. Therefore, the issue of drinking tea really needs to be studied.

Shennong's Materia Medica once had the following description: "Tea tastes bitter, drinking it makes people more thoughtful, sleep less, feel lighter, and have clearer vision." In terms of its composition, it contains protein, theine, tannic acid, essential oils, and amino acids. In terms of its effects, tea can quench thirst and refresh the mind, can indeed help digestion and promote growth, is a diuretic that can excrete toxins from the body, and can also bleach the decomposed products of pathological pigments, which can be called a physiological "blood purifier." However, tannic acid does indeed have the effect of inhibiting the digestion of protein, so it is best not to drink tea immediately after drinking milk or eating foods rich in protein. Finally, we can know that tea can be drunk, but it is appropriate to not make it too strong or drink too much.

### Native Cloth Curtains Worth Promoting

— Yu Jun

In recent years, the general curtain supplies have mostly been imported goods, taking their delicate quality and bright and non-fading dyeing. However, this one item alone, the annual leakage, I am afraid it is not a small number.

In fact, the native cloth produced in our country is an excellent curtain raw material. Because throughout the year, except for a summer when thin quality is needed, the other three seasons all need curtains that are heavy and drooping and do not flutter in the slightest breeze. This one condition, with our country's native cloth, is more suitable. What is now needed is the progress of dyeing; if the native cloth can be dyed with harmonious colors, then hanging it in the glass window, its rough cloth surface can conversely cover up the ugly points of ordinary cotton fabrics, and fully show its rich and noble appearance.

Curvilinear and complex patterns have now become a thing of the past. What is popular in this era is simple straight-line patterns. It is naturally not a convenient thing to print complex patterns on rough native cloth. However, printing coarse-line and artistic straight-line patterns on the entire piece of native cloth, hanging it in the glass window of a three-dimensional house, matched with the three-dimensional furniture in the house, its harmonious components are definitely not the same as the imported printed foreign cloth or tweed curtains that are incompatible with everything in the East.

In the summer, using native cloth curtains is indeed too thick, but using high-quality summer cloth, printing some simple straight-line patterns, is it not enough to配制 curtains? Why are the big entrepreneurs who advocate domestic products unwilling to focus on this?

### Four Women's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition

— Fang Shan

The Daxin Bookstore will hold a calligraphy and painting exhibition by four female artists: Chen Xiaocui from Hang County, Feng Wenfeng from Heshan, Xie Yuemei from Wujin, and Gu Fei from Nanhui. It is said that on this day last year, they held a joint exhibition once, causing a sensation. Compared to last year, this second exhibition is even more splendid. Xiaocui's works include about a hundred fan paintings, with landscapes and beautiful women, free and elegant, unparalleled for a time. Her imitations of Xinluo and Liuru are especially good. Occasionally, she paints orchids and bamboos, which are also graceful and ethereal. Xiaocui has a smart talent, and she is skilled in everything she learns. In addition to calligraphy and painting, she excels in poetry, lyrics, and prose. The exhibition will also sell seven volumes of Cui Lou Continued Collection, all of which are her recent works. The lady's poetry, since the separation and chaos, is even more elevated in style. The tragic places are close to Du Ling. The lyrics and music are especially dignified and beautiful, capable of inheriting Nai Weng's mantle. She is truly a remarkable woman. It is said that Wenfeng is currently ill, so there are not many works. She collaborated with Xiaocui on dozens of fan paintings, which are quite exquisite. Gu Fei is the sister of Fo Ying. She is also good at poetry. Her landscape paintings have a delicate and refined style, rich in the spirit of 　卷. Recently, she studied poetry with an old man from a famous mountain, so many of her paintings have inscriptions by the famous mountain. Her works are very rich, numbering several dozen, with works such as Listening to the Spring in Lushan being especially excellent. Yuemei is the sister of the deceased lyricist Xie Yucen. She specializes in flower and bird paintings, imitating the Song and Yuan dynasties. Her paintings are noble, elegant, and quiet. Her works are also more numerous than last year. There are three sets of calligraphy and painting screens jointly created by the three, with different tunes and the same skill. The exhibition will be held for seven days starting from May 27th. Female talents in painting are rare in the world, and the perfect combination is even rarer, so I am happy to record it.

### A Week's Worth of Ordinary Single-Star Home Dishes

— Ms. Hua Ying

Since the new broad beans came out, it has not been a month, and they have already become very old. If you still stir-fry them, although you can shell them, you always feel that they are not very flavorful. Therefore, the best way is to shell them first, and then put them in the pot to stir-fry. If you want to be more particular, I will invent a ten-scenery broad bean. Use diced chicken, diced bamboo shoots, diced ham, shrimp meat, dried scallops, bean curd skin, winter mushrooms, etc., and stir-fry them with broad beans. The freshness and deliciousness of the taste are truly indescribable, but the cost is also considerable. The ordinary way to do it is still to stir-fry broad beans with pickled vegetables and bamboo shoots, or broad bean sand with green onions, and broad bean sand with pickled vegetables, which is also not bad. Because it is fresh broad beans, it feels much more delicious than broad bean sand made with dried broad beans.

Spring and Autumn

### A Public Medical Problem

— Xi Nan

Starting from the Aspect of Providing Diagnosis and Medication

There are three major problems in society: one is the food problem, one is the fuel problem, and one is the medical problem. Everyone knows to pay attention to food and fuel, but because illness is not something everyone has, there are fewer people paying attention to the medical problem. In fact, the medical problem for human life sometimes even exceeds the two problems of food and fuel. It is true to say that obtaining it means life, obtaining little means death, and losing it by a hair's breadth leads to a great error. However, people nowadays would rather not get sick. Once they get sick, not only is there immense mental suffering, but the loss of work time goes without saying. This medical bill is especially considerable.

Chinese medicine has risen seven, eight, or nine times due to the blockage of sources, and there is even no goods at any price. Western medicine, due to the European war and the impact of foreign exchange, has risen again and again and again from the Shanghai war to the present. It cannot be measured by common sense. Not to mention anything else, even gauze and cotton have risen eight times more than before the war. It is common for Western doctors to charge twenty yuan, even ten, for a house call. Outpatient visits cost four, six, or eight yuan, which is not considered a big deal. Chinese medicine outpatient visits cost two yuan or four yuan, which is also considered minimal. A dose of Chinese medicine costs seven, eight, or more than ten yuan, which is said to be ordinary; some are even more expensive, costing dozens of yuan, which is not surprising. The cost of Western medicine is even more needless to say! The cost of an injection of ten gold is not surprising. It is said that a shot of diphtheria antitoxin costs ninety yuan. A child next door, suffering from diphtheria, was admitted to the hospital at nine o'clock and died at ten o'clock in the afternoon, costing as much as a thousand yuan. It is often heard from people who have recovered from illness in the hospital that it costs two or three thousand yuan, four or five thousand yuan, which is enough to scare people. May I ask the current working class, working diligently day and night, is it not enough to support their families? Unfortunately, unfortunately, and unfortunately, if they are also visited by the evil disease demon, not to say that it will break the middle-class family, it is simply at a loss. Apart from relying on their own resistance to fight the disease demon, there is no other way. If they want to consult a doctor and take medicine, they must think twice. May I ask, even ants cherish their lives, how can people be willing to sit and wait for death? However, when people reach a helpless situation, where do they have the money to hire a doctor? Even if they hire a doctor, they do not have enough money to buy medicine. People will not know this situation unless it happens to them. If they put themselves in their shoes, they will not only shudder, but also feel extremely miserable!

The day before yesterday, I met Gong Zhenqu, a colleague from the Commercial Daily fifteen years ago. I talked to him about the medical problem. I said: You are in charge of providing medical diagnosis and medication (Gong is the director of the Charity Department of the Buddhist Pure Karma Society). According to your experience, what is the medical problem now? Mr. Gong said it was difficult! difficult! I said: What is the difficulty? He said: Medicine is too expensive, and people are too poor. I said: Everyone knows that medicine is too expensive; what does being too poor have to do with the medical problem? He said: Because people are poor, they feel that the medical problem is particularly serious: It also makes the medical diagnosis and medication we provide more serious! I said: What you said is a bit mysterious! I can't figure it out. He said: From the time I started the Charity Department of the Buddhist Pure Karma Society, it has been fifteen years. I have only seen more and more people coming for diagnosis every day. Not to mention before, last year alone, there were 27,170 Chinese medicine calls, 23,882 Western medicine calls, and 15,537 free calls for the extremely poor (waiving the two-corner registration fee). In total, there were 66,593 calls. More than 42,600 doses of Chinese medicine were dispensed. Western medicine is not included. You can imagine that this number is already considerable. This year is even worse. There are always more than two hundred calls coming for diagnosis every day. At this rate, will it not exceed 70,000 calls? I said: Indeed. He said: This is precisely because people are poor. In the past, most of those who came to the diagnosis department were the so-called poor families. Now, those who are usually called small and medium-sized bourgeoisie, squeezed by the rising prices in recent years, are not enough to supply their lives. When they encounter illness, they have to abandon their vanity and come to us for diagnosis. Our career has indeed developed! However, our funding has encountered great difficulties. The price of medicine has risen seven or eight times, and the expense has also expanded seven or eight times. The number of people coming for diagnosis has also increased by thousands. Both sides are expanding at the same time, but the source of funds has not increased. Do you think it is difficult or not?

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(8) Tangible Friendship

"Could it be that he didn't arrange for me first and go to Shunde with Old Yuan?" He couldn't help thinking like this. "But even if he went to Shunde, there should be a letter!" He really couldn't figure out the reason.

This afternoon, Yu Kun came again, revealing a very excited look as soon as he entered the door.

"Old Er, it really worked out! He waved a newspaper wrapped in his hand at Begonia and said nonsensically, "What a Seventh Master Yuan, really good friend! Ji Zhaoxiong that kid was actually done by him!"

Begonia stared with one right eye, not understanding what he was saying for a moment.

Yu Kun turned around like the wind and gently closed the door. In fact, those nurses also knew that the patient in room seven was a bit strange. Shao Wen and Yu Kun's two requests for the nurses to leave had made them wary and they were unwilling to stand in the ward and hinder other people's conversations anymore.

"Look! It's very clearly published in the newspaper." Yu Kun quietly came to Begonia's bed, opened the newspaper with both hands, and kept it about a foot away from Begonia's face, just enough for him to see the words on the newspaper clearly without having to reach out himself.

Begonia first looked up with his right eye and saw that it was a "Beijing Morning Post" published three days ago.

Yu Kun also knew that he only had the eyeball of one eye left, so he quickly moved his hands down a little, just enough for him to see the news section he wanted him to see. (115)

### ·This Time, This Place· Excellent Training Institute

To turn people into "pillars," one must first be knowledgeable and well-versed in the classics: Doing anything with the title "Doctor" or "Master" is guaranteed to be worth three times as much, and business will flourish!

Thinking of this, strolling on the street and learning seem to be unrelated; in fact, as long as you read the "articles" of the plaintiffs, you can understand. These "articles" are all-encompassing: English is English, French is French, and Chinese is Chinese; there are also parallel prose, eight-legged essays, astronomy, geography, comics, and minor tunes, everything is available. Among them, minor tunes must be "taught personally" by the plaintiff, so as not to make future "learning useless."

(2)

Secondly, invigorating the spirit is also one of the urgent tasks at hand. A spiritless person cannot be a hero. A great man must have the spirit of sticking out his chest, sticking out his belly, and making continuous efforts!

Where to learn it? The movie theater.

Those who usually disdain "fighting" must bravely go forward and "sacrifice" a bit when buying tickets; those who are usually accustomed to dozing off must flick their eyes and shake their bodies when crowded. The best result may be the general mobilization of the spirit here; therefore, even a "consumptive ghost" will uncontrollably sing out loud when he sees it, or at least scream strangely.

(3)

Next, physical exercise is more important than eating.

Exercising in the wilderness? No. Exercising in the park? No. Even Zhuge Liang cannot guess it: In the dog racing field, the Jai Alai field, and the dance hall!

Dog racing, people are dogs; playing Jai Alai, people are balls; dancing, people are waltzes, fox trots.

And running, jumping, startling, and palpitating, with the head and neck turning in all directions, and the hands and feet dancing, isn't this enough exercise?

There is also proof: People who often go to the above three places have particularly big bellies!

(4)

Determination is second only to physical exercise; and it is best to be as firm as iron nails pounded into eighteen layers of hell.

Mahjong cards, roulette, old man loves to die... Losing everything but a pair of pants, pawning the pants to try to win back.

The will remains unchanged throughout!

### "Economic News"

— Yangtze River

When I was studying at school, I always liked to pick up the newspaper and read some sports news and education news first when I went to the reading room at home or during class breaks every morning. Next were political news, social news, and economic news.

Recently, I accidentally talked to a friend who already had a family burden. He said that his interest in reading newspapers has changed recently; the attention that he originally liked to read the most, sports news, has now shifted to economic news.

He said: I immediately open the newspaper and read the economic news every morning when I get up. I see some "Rice prices tend to rise due to hoarding by unscrupulous merchants," "Coal briquettes prices soar after being monopolized," "Oil prices hold steady, waiting for the rising wind to stop," and... In fact, these do not arouse reading interest, but you have to read them.

I felt dark in my heart when I heard about the shift in his attention to reading newspapers.
