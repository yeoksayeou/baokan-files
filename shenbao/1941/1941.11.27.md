The people of the Northeast are one with the life of our entire nation and cannot be torn apart. Any organization must be fundamentally abolished. Our territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity must be completely restored. If this goal is not achieved, our struggle will not cease for a single day. This is the unanimous determination of our entire people, without any room for change. We hereby resolve, (Dated 26th).

Chongqing - The most important motion at this morning's Political Council meeting was to support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's September 18th declaration this year. The entire meeting stood to indicate unanimous passage. The declaration reiterated China's war aims, which must include the complete recovery of lost territories and the four northeastern provinces. As for the proposal to urge President Roosevelt to pay attention to China's war aims, many councilors felt that there was room for consideration as to whether the Political Council should directly express its views to foreign countries, so the case was referred to the Secretariat for handling.

Key Points of Tan Zan's Address

Chongqing - Councilor Tan Zan delivered a speech at today's closing ceremony of the Political Council, stating that he was re-elected as a councilor in this session. Due to work commitments, he was unable to return to the country to participate in the last session. Fortunately, he was able to return to the country as scheduled for this session, and he felt extremely honored to gather with the virtuous talents from all over the country. He personally witnessed the national unity and sincere solidarity. Under the leadership of our leader, we are struggling arduously, fighting a life-and-death battle with Japan to defend our national territory, while engaging in reconstruction in the rear, with various undertakings advancing by leaps and bounds. He was deeply moved by this and expressed his deep respect. Since the Qing Dynasty's misgovernment, the national strength has declined, and overseas Chinese have been discriminated against everywhere, unable to hold their heads high for a long time. Since our war of resistance, the world has seen our nation unite to resist foreign aggression and repeatedly win victories. Not only are we defending our national territory, but also safeguarding the peace and security of mankind in the world, upholding justice and righteousness, and fulfilling our greatest responsibility. As a result, the world has changed its views and gradually increased its respect for our overseas Chinese. From this, our overseas Chinese can stand shoulder to shoulder with the world. This is all due to the courageous fighting of our compatriots across the country, which has led to the continuous increase of our international standing. However, the treatment of overseas Chinese in certain countries still follows the old practices, and there are many harsh and unreasonable aspects that need to be corrected. We hope that the government will adopt the public opinion of the overseas Chinese and expedite negotiations with various countries to revise these practices. This is his sincere request, and he urges the government to handle it earnestly. Our overseas Chinese are scattered all over the world, but their concern for the motherland is unwavering. Although they cannot return to the country to share the difficulties with our compatriots across the country, their patriotic enthusiasm is no different from that of our domestic compatriots. For many years, overseas Chinese have contributed their hard-earned money to the motherland in a steady stream, and the amount is indeed considerable. This has been the case in the past, and we should strive even harder in the future, so that we can work together to build our great cause of national rejuvenation. He was extremely inspired to hear our leader's important instructions on "resolving the Japanese incident" at this session, and he was deeply comforted to hear the various policy reports presented by the government authorities and the great words and arguments of his colleagues in the Council who were passionately planning for the country. During the ten days of this session, we resolved many important proposals, and we have practical and feasible suggestions for foreign affairs, finance, military affairs, and industry, which we offer to the government. In the review committees or in the plenary sessions, everyone was candid, enthusiastically discussed, and repeatedly deliberated, striving for thoroughness and harmony. All discussions were based on the supreme goal of the war of resistance, with no narrow views or emotional biases. This fully demonstrated our spirit of unity and resistance against foreign aggression. After the recess, he will return overseas and will do his best to promote the reality of our domestic compatriots' arduous resistance and joint efforts for rejuvenation to the overseas Chinese, so that they can better understand the domestic situation, strengthen their confidence, consolidate their unity, and contribute their full strength to the motherland. He also hopes that our domestic compatriots will persevere to the end, make persistent efforts, realize the final victory, and quickly witness the completion of national reconstruction. He and his colleagues will respectfully accept Chairman Chiang's encouragement and work together to fulfill the important mission of resistance and reconstruction. (Dated 26th)

Chongqing - The Political Council has supplemented the administrative reports submitted by various groups with many review opinions. For example, the resolutions of yesterday's plenary session on the financial report were to increase national treasury revenue, ensure that those with more money contribute more, save unnecessary expenditures to reduce the gap between revenue and expenditure, and control the issuance of legal tender to increase its purchasing power and stabilize prices. For the economy, there should be an overall plan for state-run enterprises in various provinces, and private enterprises should still be encouraged and assisted in building the country through industry. Price management has not been perfected and should be improved, and hoarding should be strictly cracked down on. For transportation, new roads should be built faster, but attention must be paid to avoid waste. Highway management and civil aviation need to be improved, and the development of wireless communication should be promoted. (Havas Agency, 26th)

Chongqing - The Political Council opened on the 17th of this month and will last for ten days. After listening to government reports and passing important resolutions on national finance, economy, food, and transportation, it will be adjourned. (Reuters, 26th)

Chongqing Newspapers Comment on the Promotion of Democratic Governance

Chongqing - The Chongqing newspapers unanimously and enthusiastically supported the promotion of democratic governance passed by the National Political Council yesterday. The Central Daily News, after explaining the unavoidable postponement of the National Assembly, stated that it believed the Central Government would be happy to adopt yesterday's resolution, and that people across the country would also work hard to assist. However, true democracy and good constitutional government are not in form but in spirit. Germany and Japan also have voting elections, but where is the democratic spirit and substance? To seek the success of democracy, it should be from the bottom up, so its foundation is actually local autonomy. It also said that if a country practices democracy, it will not invade foreign countries. Therefore, if the whole world is a democratic country, permanent peace is hopeful. The Chinese nation is of course willing to be a pillar of maintaining permanent peace. The Dagongbao stated that the unanimous passage of this case fully demonstrates the spirit of the government and the people working together to overcome difficulties, enabling China to more firmly embark on the road to democracy, and it is also suitable for the current needs of the country. The Shishi Xinbao stated that this case is indeed a manifestation of current public opinion. In addition, the Executive Yuan passed the two regulations of the Provincial Council on the same day, which shows the government's respect for public opinion organs. The Xinhua Daily reported that this case reflects the eagerness of national public opinion to realize democratic politics, and how to turn moving words into real things requires greater promotion and efforts from the people of the whole country.

### Report: American Volunteers Come to China to Assist in the War

Manila - Five hundred pilots who have resigned from the United States Army and Navy have already arrived in a certain place in the Far East and have begun training to fight against Japan on behalf of China. The existence of this unit, like the volunteer army of the Spanish National Army, has become an open secret in the Far East. From Karachi to Manila, it is talked about in bars and clubs everywhere, and even newspapers mention it. I also heard somewhere that Royal Air Force pilots are also allowed to resign and volunteer to help China, but I cannot confirm this statement. This group of American volunteers includes 100 experienced pilots and 400 ground personnel. They are using Curtis P-40s. Because they were selected from different army and navy squadrons, they first undergo rigorous combat training, such as formation flying, before coming to China to defend Yunnan, Chongqing, and other threatened areas. Most of the pilots are from the Pensacola Naval Base. Reliable sources say that the pilots are paid US$600 per month, a bonus of US$500 for each Japanese plane shot down, and each is insured for US$25,000. Most of them deposit their salaries in the United States, and only a few remain for use in the Far East. Chinese pilots have also been sent to the United States for training. The first group of 54 people, led by a Chinese Air Force major, will arrive in the United States soon and begin training at the Armed Forces Flying Field (probably in Texas). During training, American pilots have had several accidents. It is said that two people have died, and two others have returned home. Some pilots are homesick. As far as I know, the American authorities in the Far East are not completely satisfied with the way this plan is being implemented.

### White House Holds Important Meeting; Focus on Discussing Far East Situation; Key Diplomatic, Naval, and Army Personnel Participate; US Embassy in Japan Notifies Citizens to Leave

Washington, United Press Agency, 26th - Congress will not take its usual three-day holiday at the beginning of December due to the deteriorating situation in the Pacific. It is rumored that no progress has been made in the "peace or war" negotiations with Japan. There is speculation that President Roosevelt is considering sending troops to the Dutch East Indies. President Roosevelt recently met with his main military and diplomatic advisors at the White House. The meeting was said to be of a review nature. Attendees included Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of War Stimson, Army Chief of Staff Marshall, and Navy Chief of Staff Stark. Hull said the meeting was a "general discussion," but it is widely believed that the Far East situation was one of the main topics discussed. Hull formally stated that he had met with the diplomatic representatives of Britain, China, and the Netherlands to discuss the Far East situation and said that his negotiations with General Nomura and Saburo Kurusu would likely continue at any time. Hull said that it was too early to say whether the negotiations could reach any basis and that whether such a basis could be reached would only be known after further negotiations. He further stated, "I am not aware of any plans to send American troops to the Dutch East Indies, like sending troops to Dutch Guiana." British Ambassador Halifax visited the State Department and met with Hull for about an hour, apparently to discuss the Far East situation. The British Ambassador said he had new instructions. It is speculated that these new instructions are related to the US's response to the demands made by Japan over the weekend. It is believed that Halifax informed Hull that recent London reports said that Japan had requested to manage the defense of the entire country of Thailand, which Thailand was said to have rejected. It is also understood that the representatives of the United States, Britain, China, and the Netherlands held a meeting on Monday night to consider the demands made by Japan over the weekend. Reliable sources say that this request cannot be considered a reason for progress in the negotiations. Reports say that Japan's current attitude seems to be close to straddling the fence, and no solution has been made because Tokyo continues to recognize Germany as the future world power. Therefore, Japan is unwilling to sever its ties with the Axis powers, which is a prerequisite for the United States to resolve the Pacific problem. Some political figures believe that President Roosevelt's announcement of sending troops to Dutch Guiana was an indirect probing method in order to find out what public opinion would be if troops were sent to the Dutch East Indies when deemed appropriate. One thing worth noting is that President Roosevelt said that the purpose of sending troops to Dutch Guiana was to protect the region's bauxite ore production. The tin, rubber, and other raw materials in the Far East can also be used for the same reason. Whether the Netherlands welcomes the US military sending troops to the East Indies is a question that everyone admits. The United States is doing its best to avoid suggestions that this action infringes on the sovereignty of any country, even friendly countries such as the Netherlands. However, political figures point out that the Dutch government in London has agreed to the US sending troops to Guiana, so they are likely to welcome sending troops to the Dutch East Indies if they deem it necessary. Most of the leaders in Congress, even those who belong to the isolationist faction, have agreed to sending troops to Guiana.

Australian Defense is Extremely Strong; Manila Bay Will Be Fortified

Sydney, Reuters, 26th - British Cabinet Representative to the Far East Duff Cooper arrived here yesterday by plane from New Zealand.

London, Reuters, 26th - Australian Government's Special Representative to London, Sir [blank] Page, said in a speech at the Overseas League yesterday that he has seen the entire defense of Australia and the Pacific, so he can guarantee that the strength of these defenses has never been greater than it is today. It is still being rapidly strengthened. If a test is necessary, he believes that these defenses will be as solid as gold. Page also mentioned the defenses of the Dutch East Indies and the US-controlled islands, saying that the defense of Honolulu is now impenetrable. As for Australia, it has become a British military factory east of the Suez Canal and is shipping large quantities of steel and munitions to Britain to strengthen its defenses.

Tokyo, Reuters, 26th - According to Japanese sources in Manila, the US military authorities in the Far East have formally announced that they plan to begin fortifying the entrances to Manila Bay and laying mines around the islands next month. At the same time, they will announce that from December 1st to 23rd, the 15-kilometer territorial waters near the fortified islands will be a dangerous area, as coastal artillery and defense exercises will be held in this area on the above dates.

Washington, United Press Agency, 26th - The diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, China, and the Netherlands and the US's main diplomatic and military personnel meeting at the White House yesterday all suggested that the United States should take the responsibility of clearing the way in major actions in the Far East. Initially, everyone expected that Secretary of State Hull would meet with Japanese special envoy Kurusu again last night, but he actually held an informal meeting with Chinese Ambassador Hu Shi. But for the time being, it is widely believed that no disputes will occur in the Pacific situation for the time being, because President [blank] Roosevelt has announced that he will go to Warm Springs on Friday for a few days of stay.

Tokyo, United Press Agency, 26th - "Daily News" today published a special dispatch from Washington saying that Washington's attitude towards US-Japan talks is more pessimistic than at any time in the past few weeks. The headline of the report was "US-Japan talks will soon be revealed, both sides' conditions have been exhausted." The newspaper also published a dispatch from its London visitor saying, "Britain is now frantically preparing for war, and is considering Japan as a possible enemy."

Tokyo, Reuters, 26th - According to Japanese news agency reports, the US Embassy, ​​seeing the scarcity of Pacific shipping, has advised American citizens staying in the Japanese Empire to evacuate as soon as possible. American citizens in China have also received the same advice. This advice has been issued for the fourth time, involving all types of Americans, except those born in the United States to Japanese parents. It is estimated that there are a total of 860 Americans staying in the Japanese Empire, excluding American-born Japanese. It is believed that most American missionaries do not want to leave Japan.

With the Agreement of the Netherlands and Brazil, US Troops Arrive in Suriname

Paramaribo (Dutch Suriname), Reuters, 26th - The first batch of US troops has arrived here and is warmly welcomed by the residents. The US military has obtained permission from the governments of the Netherlands and Brazil to occupy Dutch Suriname and protect the bauxite mines that are of great importance to the US defense industry.

Batavia, Reuters, 26th - Dutch East Indies government officials Mock and Koesjton will serve in the Dutch cabinet on behalf of the Dutch East Indies. The People's Council held a farewell meeting yesterday. The Speaker said in his speech that since the Dutch government moved to London, the cabinet has been reorganized three times, and the government's strength has gradually increased in both guidance and organization. Now that two Dutch East Indies politicians have joined the cabinet, the nature of the empire has become more prominent. It is heard that the two cabinet members have plans to visit Curacao and Suriname, which is welcome because Curacao produces oil and Suriname produces bauxite, both of which are public arsenals of democratic countries, and it is necessary to defend them against enemy attacks. Both of these places have previously received assistance from Britain, but have now requested military assistance from the US government.

### Bangkok Radio Claims Thailand Will Be Forced to Fight; Will Welcome Allied Assistance at That Time; Rejection of Japanese Demands

Reuters, Bangkok, 26th: Bangkok Radio last night announced that Thailand may be forced by circumstances to abandon its neutrality and seek self-defense, and will welcome the assistance of friendly nations at that time. Although there is still a slight hope for peace, it seems inevitable that Thailand will be drawn into war. Today's newspaper editorials and headlines clearly reflect the public's unease about certain suspicious events and their determination to defend their national sovereignty. The Ras Suei newspaper disclosed a piece of news, roughly stating that a certain foreigner was sketching a bridge in the city at the end of the week. When he saw the police coming, he drove away. The newspaper also reiterated that the public should pay attention to the activities of spies and the fifth column. The Lan Sang newspaper said that certain foreigners are now going to schools in Bangkok, claiming to have permission to draw blood from students' ears to test for malaria. The Subabu Pras newspaper issued a warning to foreigners, saying that sovereignty cannot be given to others, and you should respect the sovereignty of the Thai people. The Thai people can be your friends, otherwise, the Thai people are prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend it. The Lun Mu newspaper also stated that we will maintain our neutrality and independence, and we will never give an inch of land to the aggressor. Under the guidance of the current Prime Minister, the Thai people are now strongly united.

United Press, London, 26th: Reliable sources say that the Thai government has rejected Japan's verbal proposal to obtain complete defense of Thailand, and Japan is therefore continuing to pressure the Bangkok government.

Reuters, Bangkok, 26th: It is widely believed that the third-class reservists will report today. They completed training in 1938, 1939, and 1940. It is also believed that if the situation worsens, reservists of all levels will soon be called into service.

Reuters, Bangkok, 26th: Reliable sources say that if Thailand is forced to fight to save its independence, the local overseas Chinese will be able to supply at least 150,000 highly efficient laborers as a contribution to manpower. It is said that a large number of local overseas Chinese, in view of the current critical situation, have offered to do their best for the places where they live. It is estimated that if an emergency occurs, it would not be difficult to gather 150,000 laborers in Bangkok alone in a short period of time. However, due to the delicate issue of the overseas Chinese offer, the authorities believe that the time to accept it has not yet arrived.

### Litvinov Flies to Singapore; Steinhardt Arrives in New York

Reuters, London, 26th: The new Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, flew to Singapore from Iraq yesterday by plane, accompanied by his wife and staff.

### Bullitt Appointed U.S. Envoy to the Near East; Will Soon Inspect the Transportation of Supplies Along the Red Sea Coast

Havas, Washington, 25th: An official announcement states that the government has recently appointed former ambassador to France and the Soviet Union, Bullitt, as President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Near East. According to the President, Bullitt will make an extensive trip to the Near East. In essence, he will go to the front lines in Libya, the Nile Valley, the Red Sea coast, and Palestine to inspect the transportation of American supplies to those places. Political figures say that Bullitt's mission to the Near East shows that President Roosevelt attaches great importance to the Libyan campaign. The British army's offensive in the Libyan desert marks the entry of the current European war into another stage. Bullitt's mission has both military and diplomatic functions. On the one hand, he must engage in diplomatic activities, and on the other hand, he must report to the President on the combat situation of American tanks and aircraft on the front lines in the Near East on his return journey. Moreover, Bullitt's planned trip to Palestine suggests that he may take the opportunity to engage in some activities in Turkey.

### Chilean President Passes Away

Haitong News Agency, Santiago, Chile, 26th: The President of Chile, Cerda, passed away here yesterday afternoon. Cerda was born in 1879.

### Donitz's Soviet Forces Continue to Advance; Bloody Battle on the Moscow Front; German Vanguard Reaches Klin; Red Army Reinforcements Arriving to Contain Them

TASS, Klin Region, 26th: Fierce fighting is taking place in the Klin region (50 kilometers from Moscow). Although the enemy has a numerical advantage, our army is still putting up strong resistance. Because the enemy encountered strong resistance from our army in the Volokolamsk area, it shifted its pressure to Klin. In the past two days, the enemy participated in the battle with two tank divisions and one motorized unit. After fierce fighting, the enemy broke through our positions and reached the main road. Fierce fighting is currently underway. After receiving reinforcements, our army is defending every inch of the homeland at the entrance to the capital.

Reuters, London, 26th: It is reported that the Soviet forces in the Donitz region are continuing to advance. The Soviet forces on the Moscow front are engaged in the most intense bloody battle since the start of the war, as the German army has intensified its pressure after several tank divisions arrived as reinforcements. It is reported that the German army is trying to break through Klin (50 miles northwest of Moscow) and Tula (60 miles south of the Soviet capital) but has been repelled by the Soviet army.

Reuters, London, 26th: Germany's main offensive in Soviet territory still targets Moscow. Although the German army has suffered extremely heavy losses in manpower and material resources, it is still doing everything possible to capture the Soviet capital. Because of the strength of the defenses west of the city, the Soviet army's frontal assault has failed. It is now assembling more than half of its tanks and attacking the northwest and due south flanks of the Soviet capital's defenses at Klin and Tula. The German vanguard has advanced to the Klin railway station between Kalinin and Moscow, but the Soviet army is rushing reinforcements to contain them.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 26th: Military sources revealed this afternoon that the German advance is increasingly approaching the inner defense lines of Moscow. Soviet positions have been shifting backward in recent days. It is reported that the news that the Soviet Union is transferring troops stationed in the Far East to defend Moscow has now been confirmed.

TASS, Southern Front, 26th: A special correspondent for the Izvestia newspaper said that fighting is taking place on the Southern Front. After launching an offensive, the Red Army is forcing the enemy to retreat with hand-to-hand combat and bayonet charges, achieving victory after victory. It has advanced 100 kilometers in some areas. The German 16th Tank Division and the crack Christof machine units were almost completely annihilated. The heroic Red Army is still advancing fiercely, capturing many villages and towns every day. Yesterday morning, our army advanced another 15 kilometers on the Southern Front.

Editorial

### German-Japanese Relations in the U.S.-Japan Negotiations

As the Washington talks are in a state of flux, the world is watching future developments with nervous tension. In all anti-aggression countries, their exceptional concern is self-evident. However, regardless of the success or failure of the negotiations, there is no need to be anxious or worried, because if peace in the Pacific can be maintained, it is inevitable that the U.S. authorities' position and policies have been implemented. If the negotiations fail, there is great confidence in everything in the future, so ABCD and other countries related to the Pacific can always maintain consistent composure and trust. At this moment, the most anxious and uneasy is Germany. Even though Japan's past assistance to the Axis has been far from satisfying Nazi demands, if Japan were to truly submit to the democratic front, it would undoubtedly inflict a major blow on the Axis. In the course of the U.S.-Japan talks, Japan's departure from or estrangement from the Axis is undoubtedly one of the important issues. The Japanese side has always been noncommittal about this issue, which is of greatest concern to Britain and the United States, and has not deviated from an ambiguous, wavering, and opportunistic attitude. Therefore, between Britain and the United States and the Nazis, an underhand struggle to deal with Japan is now unfolding. Whether or not the U.S.-Japan negotiations can succeed depends not only on whether there is any possibility of approaching each other's positions, but also on how the Nazis exhaust all methods to directly and indirectly exert pressure on Japan.

Germany is currently placing itself in a gamble of shared success or failure, and its various measures and actions cannot be regarded as being taken solely to influence Japan. But in any case, Japan is the most important target in the Nazi diplomatic offensive at this moment. If Moscow could be captured early according to Hitler's timetable, then Kurusu would not have to make this trip. If the Nazi coveting of North Africa was successful, then it would be difficult for British imperial warships to come to the Far East. Precisely because of this, Hitler currently cannot but recklessly launch another fierce attack on the Soviet capital, and exert pressure on Vichy. The revival of the Anti-Comintern Pact with expansion and extension is also for the same purpose. This pact had long been shelved since the conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, and people had gradually forgotten it. Now, it is suddenly brought up again at a time when the U.S.-Japan negotiations are in a tense stage. The Soviet side ordered a five-year extension and expanded the participating units to include all of the Axis's vassals and partners. This is a display of force, and also a demonstration, and Japan has once again been burdened with a new shackle by the Nazis, and at the same time cast a shadow on the talks in Washington.

The activities of the Nazi fifth column in Japan have been reported from time to time. In Shanghai, where democratic countries have an absolute advantage, Nazi propaganda is even more active than that of any belligerent country. This shows what they are doing to an allied country that may waver. Japan's recent wait-and-see attitude and attempts to seek compromise with the United States have undoubtedly made Hitler impatient. According to his wishes, it would be best for Japan to quickly end the war in China, and then gather its remaining strength, whether to advance north to contain the Soviet Union, or to advance south to attack Britain and the United States, which would be very beneficial to the Nazis. However, on the other hand, the Nazis only have high hopes for Japan, but cannot solve Japan's difficult situation. Since the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, Britain and the United States have taken an increasingly firm attitude towards Japan. From economic sanctions to freezing funds, all can be regarded as the price paid by Japan for maintaining its alliance with Germany (in fact, it is only using its alliance with Germany to pursue its expansionist desires). Before the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, Japan could still maintain some contact with the Soviet Union through the Soviet Union, but in the past five months, even this remaining bit of communication has been cut off, leaving only the two countries subjected to the blockade to look at each other from afar, and Japan's situation is even worse. Now Japan is surrounded by the world's first-class naval, land, and air forces, as well as the greatest human and material resources, which are now on high alert in preparation for any eventuality, and all have the same strong determination to respond to future developments in a unified manner. For example, Thailand, a year ago, was still regarded as a country friendly to Japan. In the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute last winter, the Japanese side sacrificed the interests of French Vietnam to win its favor. However, recently, Thailand has gradually moved from estrangement to vigilance towards Japan, and has even taken mobilization measures and appealed to friendly nations for assistance. If something happens in the Indochinese Peninsula, there will be no doubt about Thailand's direction. Yesterday, it was reported that the Japanese representative had suggested to the Thai government that it obtain complete defense of Thailand. This aggressive attitude will inevitably promote the Thai people's determination to defend their country. The Nazi diplomatic offensive against Japan, even if its momentum is impressive, should pale in comparison to the unprecedented large-scale contingency preparations in the Far East, and the clash of these two forces is the major distress of the Japanese authorities.

Japan's repeated initiation of diplomatic negotiations with the United States proves that it is not willing to merely follow the Axis to the end, and it may not regard the expectation of Nazi victory as waiting for the Yellow River to clear. The reason why it has always been unable to escape is that on the one hand, they share the same smell and have similar interests, and on the other hand, because other than the Axis and its affiliated countries, there are no other friendly countries that can be approached. The current Japan is certainly looking forward to the easing of pressure from democratic countries, but it still hopes for a Nazi victory in the event of an emergency. Therefore, it is indecisive and finds it difficult to make definite decisions on the demands made by the United States and the Nazis. Even if we take the point of withdrawing from the Axis, it has now been proven to be impossible by the re-signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Even if we take a step back, even if Japan is willing to bend to the demands of Britain and the United States, the price it will demand will exceed the limits that Britain and the United States can promise. In fact, the Japanese people's enthusiasm for the Nazis has indeed declined compared to a year ago, but the Tripartite Pact has always been a powerful weapon to coerce Britain and the United States. At the same time, this is also an opportunity for the Nazis to launch a diplomatic offensive against Japan, which is something that the world should deeply recognize.

### Travel on the Sichuan River (4)

— Ji Sheng

In the morning, we passed "Dao Shi Kou," which is a famous dangerous shoal on the Min River. The steady hull suddenly started to shake. The boatmen told us to sit down and not panic, so we turned our attention from the magazines to the outside of the boat. In front of us was a row of green, lush, and dark cliffs, which, together with the turbulent water of the shoals, seemed a bit fierce. The rapids were blocked by the cliffs and turned to the right, flowing out in the narrow valley. A heavily loaded boat had to head straight towards the cliffs, and when it was near the foot of the cliffs, it would immediately turn the rudder, turn the bow to the right, and go down the river with the current, and it would be out of danger. If you don't understand this, and you rush around recklessly, you will either run aground and capsize, or you will rush to the foot of the rocks, and the whole boat will be turned into powder. I heard that this is a microcosm of the dangerous shoal "Come at Me" in the Three Gorges.

It was late, and the area was very desolate. The boat owner wanted to make up for lost time, so he missed the big villages and towns where boats could be docked. Relying on the moonlight and the fact that it was a downriver boat, he decided to push past "Wang Zhuang" and look for a place to dock. "Wang Zhuang," this place name that cannot be separated from bad people and robbery, made experienced passengers sigh in annoyance when they heard it. But, this has become a reality, how can you allow yourself to hesitate again? In the end, everyone was immersed in darkness and silence, anxiously paying attention to the movement on the shore. We passed the shoal. The sound of the rushing water mixed with the sound of the shoal stones hitting each other was unusually clear, strange, and pleasant to the ear, but who was still in the mood to appreciate it!

At nine o'clock in the evening, the boat finally docked beside a small country market. It was only fifty miles from Yibin. Ten hours of sailing covered more than three hundred and twenty miles. If the boat had left on time in the morning, it would have arrived in Yibin long ago. Although we waited for dinner and tidied up our lodgings, it was not until the last hour of the day that we could rest. But when I looked at the moon by the river before going to sleep, and thought about the galloping journey of today, and thought about watching the moon in Luzhou tomorrow, the fatigue of the whole day was dispelled by joy.

We arrived in Luzhou on time. We heard that there would be no downriver boats in the next few days. In order to arrive in Chongqing as soon as possible, we finally suppressed our fear and hesitation and contacted a wooden boat. Fortunately, Luzhou, the prosperous distribution center formed by the abundance of the Tuo River, has plenty of heavily loaded boats carrying salt and sugar. The boats are large, and the helmsmen are experienced. What's there to be afraid of?

We were on a wooden boat again. Although the boat wasn't the biggest, it was still okay. It was loaded with alum and chalk. It was delayed again until about nine o'clock before we set off. After inquiring, we learned that the journey between Luzhou and Chongqing, which should take one and a half days, would take three days to arrive. Because from Luzhou to Hejiang and Jiangjin, Chongqing is a three-stage journey. They had to travel according to the old practice of one stage a day, otherwise there would be various inconveniences and dangers. When we heard this, we felt relieved, opened our luggage, and spent the long day reading and sleeping.

In the afternoon of the second stage of the journey, the sun was so scorching that every passenger in the cabin was dazed and asleep. It also made the boatmen, who were usually diligent, neglect their duties when a dangerous shoal was approaching. A tragedy that could have ended in death by drowning almost happened here.

"Turn the rudder up"!

The sailor who was the first to sense the danger shouted loudly. Although we were awakened, we lazily wanted to continue dreaming. But the violent jolting made everyone sit up from their stupor. One big wave after another was thrown directly onto the boat. In addition to rising and falling with the waves, we were also hit from the side, and the boat was swaying from side to side very violently. Obviously, the helmsman had lost control, and danger was imminent.

"Thump!" A terrible sound. The boat was thrown on the rocks by a big wave, followed by a small string of "crack, crack, crack..." sounds. The sailors let out cries for help.

Oh no! The boat is broken! Everyone in the cabin moved together. At this time, I lifted up a floorboard and saw that there was no water coming into the bottom of the cabin. I wanted to start a "rumor" that the boat was broken. But when I saw everyone frantically collecting their luggage and jumping off the boat to the right, I had to follow their actions. It turned out that this was a bun-shaped reef, with an area the size of a square table exposed above the water. Our boat had been hit on the edge of the reef. Fortunately, it was a flat rather than steep part, and the stern and middle of the boat were resting steadily on it. Therefore, the middle of the two sides "cracked" open. Fortunately, the river water had receded a few inches in the morning (as the old man on the shore told us afterwards), otherwise, not only would the top of the bun not be exposed for us to stand on, but even higher waves would have swallowed up the boat completely!

The river surface was several times wider than the Min River, and the width of the rapids was several times wider than the Min River. Especially in the mainstream between the reefs and the rocks protruding from the decaying bank like tongues, there were surges, swirls, rushing, and roaring, like a hungry white tiger, constantly pouncing on the old tree roots where people were hiding - that rough roar, that flickering cold light, that wave of tongues thrown onto the feet and legs... All around were symbols of devouring: we were trembling.

Small sampans rowed out of the harbor on the right bank. Despite how rapid the current was and how turbulent the whirlpools were, they rolled together with the waves and rowed upstream without any panic.

The first things loaded were the passengers and their luggage, then the alum and chalk. Finally, eight or nine small sampans towed the "damaged boat" to the shore, protecting it from the front and back. The shore was crowded with spectators. Among them was an old man who used his terrifying experiences as a comparison to congratulate us: "You have 'Dao Xing' in eating vegetarian food and chanting Buddha, so you were rescued by the Bodhisattva. It's really not easy! Of the boats that have had accidents here, it's rare for one to be rescued. There's still a soul-calling banner hanging there, which is for those who died tragically in the ferry!"

We followed his guidance and saw a tall pole standing at the end of the long, tongue-like rocky shore. A long cloth flapped in the pale sunlight with the river wind, as if comforting the wailing of ghosts mixed in the sound of the tide in the distance. Our hair stood on end, and we were more afraid than when we were in distress.

It was inevitable that the passengers surrounded the boat owner, who was also the helmsman, questioned him, and demanded compensation for losses. The boat owner begged bitterly, the old man mediated smoothly, and our desire to rush to Jiangjin for the night ended this turmoil with reprimands and advice. The newly hired wooden boat was tossing and turning in the whirlpool again. However, our trust in the new boatman's driving skills reduced the terror in our hearts.

Wooden boats sailing on the Sichuan River are indeed dangerous, but they come and go frequently and are familiar with the terrain and water conditions. "Experience" and "caution" can ensure their safety. They rarely use wind power, but they are also rarely attacked by storms. They have both affection and hate - the contradictory objects are shoal water and rapids. In the Sichuan River of the present era, they bear the heavy responsibility that transport ships cannot bear, especially shallow-water navigation. The helmsman, standing high on the stern, twisting the wooden rudder left and right, when his luck comes, is very qualified to become a "river pilot" and stand on the driver's platform of a ship, looking at the river leisurely, and using three fingers to command the engine driver to control the fate of the entire ship. (The End)

### German Foreign Minister Declares No Further Peace Proposals; Britain Closely Watches the Quisling Gathering, Resolves to Defeat the Lie of Poisoning Europe

Reuter, Berlin, 26th - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, at an important speech delivered at a banquet held this afternoon at the Royal Hotel in Berlin for foreign politicians, revealed various previously guarded secrets, explained the true significance of the August 1939 German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and the reality of Europe's preparation for a thirty-year war. Among the foreign guests invited by the Foreign Minister were representatives of the Anti-Comintern Pact signatory countries, foreign ministers and their staff from eight European nations, diplomatic missions from eleven countries, German party, government, and military officials, as well as domestic and foreign journalists. The Foreign Minister first described Britain's role in instigating the war, saying that after British politicians declared war on Germany in September 1939, they now face the seven most powerful military groups in the world and are trapped in a desperate war. The Eastern Front campaign will be the decisive factor in the outcome of this war, laying the foundation for Europe's future. The motive behind the German leader signing the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union in August 1939 was prompted by the impending conclusion of a tripartite pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The leader believed that the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact could dispel the immediate threat of a Bolshevik attack on Europe and hoped that the Kremlin would abandon its ideal of world revolution. In this way, the Soviet Union could become a peaceful neighbor with Germany, which would also be beneficial to the whole of Europe. Germany then completely changed its policy towards the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union did not keep its promise. First, it communized the Baltic states, demanded that Germany abandon its military bases in Finland, Bulgaria, and the Tatar region, and then began its anti-German activities in the diplomatic arena. In 1940, British Prime Minister Churchill declared in a secret meeting of the House of Commons, "I have received a report from our ambassador to the Soviet Union, Cripps, stating that the Soviet Union will join the British side in the war, and President Roosevelt has unreservedly guaranteed aid to Britain." The British Prime Minister used this information to alleviate the various fears among members of Parliament. The Foreign Minister continued, stating that if necessary, the European continent is capable of engaging in a thirty-year war to deal with the enemy and will never face a crisis. A united Europe will inevitably become stronger and stronger, resisting any attack. The cultural and material living standards of Russia are now in a state of enslavement. Stalin's goal is to conquer the world by force. The secrets of the Soviet Union's activities over the past twenty years have now been revealed by this war. The army organized within the Soviet Union is the largest in the world, and its material equipment is unprecedentedly powerful. However, since the beginning of this Eastern Front war, the vast territory occupied by the German army in Europe and Russia this year has dealt a major blow to Britain's only ally on the continent, weakening its military importance. Germany and Italy, along with their allies, can be said to be invincible on the European continent. This is the achievement in the military aspect. Secondly, in terms of the economy, the Axis powers and their allies, although encountering the enemy's blockade, can now survive without relying on overseas imports. The European arms industry is sufficient to supply the needs of Germany and its allies. The industry in the occupied territories is also being organized. Therefore, Germany has the two major necessary conditions for winning the final victory over Britain. Germany and its allies are strategically in a position to absolutely control Britain. Although Britain has the help of the United States, Europe has the advantage in terms of strategy and manpower. In North Africa and the Near East, the enemy still occupies bases, but the outcome will inevitably not escape the development of the military and political situation. In the Far East, Japan has the power to control the overall situation in that region. Britain has no hope of winning, but British Prime Minister Churchill still does not understand and continues to resist stubbornly. The Foreign Minister concluded by saying that the German people have absolutely no hatred for the American people, and the American people should have no hatred for the German people. However, President Roosevelt spared no effort to use various tricks, fabricate false arguments, and confuse the public, wanting to drag the United States into the war against Germany. Germany does not want this development but is also prepared to deal with Roosevelt's hostile actions. The Axis powers' imminent victory cannot be changed by the United States supplying arms to Germany's enemies or participating in the war. The so-called German attempt to eliminate religion, conquer Spain, the Americas, suppress the United States, and divide the world is pure nonsense. This is a consistent anti-German propaganda and should not be easily believed by those with discernment. In fact, being able to believe in the saying "The Americas for the Americans, Europe for the Europeans" would prevent a major disaster in the world. If a war were to break out between the United States and Europe and East Asia, then the responsibility should be borne solely by President Roosevelt. The definite information obtained in recent years has already proven that this war was instigated by Roosevelt, so the responsibility should be entirely his. President Roosevelt's policies will one day make the American people pay a very high price and plunge the country into an extreme economic crisis. If President Roosevelt truly wants to help the Soviet Union, then he is not fighting for democracy, but wants to establish totalitarian politics in the United States for himself and his Jewish advisors. I believe that the American people will one day wake up from their slumber and settle the account of this war with Roosevelt and his Jewish advisors. As long as the current war continues for one day, Britain will lose its position day by day, and the economic and military potential of the Axis powers will become more robust than that of Britain and the United States. Germany and its allies, concentrating all their efforts, can simultaneously strike the British Isles on land, sea, and air. Britain will suffer this result sooner or later. After the collapse of France, Germany made peace proposals to Britain, and there were also repeated expressions of peace before, but they were not adopted. Germany will no longer do this in the future. Even if Germany cannot achieve final victory, it will never beg for surrender. Germany, led by Führer Hitler, aims only to complete the victory of the war. Although the current work is extremely difficult, we are confident of victory. Our efforts will surely achieve this great goal.

Reuter, London, 26th - The seven Quisling gatherings have now passed. If we dismiss this puppet show as insignificant, we would be making a mistake. This is the opening ceremony of a new order conference. We all know that this so-called new order is a new despotic mask that will forever plunge Europe into death and slavery. But do the people under its rule truly know their own status? Hitler gives the appearance of peace and security. It seems that people whose lives have been shattered by war and who have been so influenced by German propaganda that they cannot see through this deception may become tempted by illusions. It would be strange indeed if there were not many who, deceived, strived for the illusion given by Hitler. Our duty is to defeat this great lie that poisons Europe by every possible means. The Atlantic Charter is our answer to the deceptive new order. We should proclaim in different places around the world, not in the formal language of the Charter itself, but in the simple words that Hitler knows how to use, that the News Chronicle says, "The only country that has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact and can completely avoid the possibility of Nazi aggression is Japan. However, Japan's attitude yesterday was not enthusiastic. Ribbentrop claims that the Red Army has been annihilated, so why is it necessary to continue this pact for five years? And why hold this grand ceremony to maintain the struggle against something that no longer exists?"

### Japanese Troops in Saigon Arrest Chinese; National Government Protests to France; More Than Seventy Innocently Arrested; Thirty-Odd Released After Protest

Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed today that regarding the arrest of more than seventy Chinese by Japanese troops in Saigon on November 22, the Chongqing government has lodged a serious protest with the French government in Vietnam and Vichy. The spokesperson stated that as a result of Chongqing's strong protest to the Hanoi government, thirty of the arrested Chinese have been released. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now trying to secure the release of the other forty-odd. Among the arrested Chinese are members of the Bank of Communications, China Travel Service, Taikoo Dockyard, and Jardine Matheson. Some of the Chinese were arrested by Japanese military police in teahouses and hotels. The foreign ministry spokesman said that the Chinese government was very angry at the atrocities of the Japanese military police in Vietnam. Japanese military police recently searched the Chinese consulate in Hanoi and illegally arrested consulate staff and several other overseas Chinese in Hanoi. Now a similar atrocity has occurred in Saigon, which shows that the Japanese army has no respect for French police power in Vietnam. In addition to protesting to the French authorities in Vietnam, the Chinese government will protest directly to Vichy. The spokesperson also addressed the Japanese claim that the bombing of the US consulate in Saigon last Sunday was the work of Chongqing terrorists, saying, "This slander proves the Japanese side's intention to shift the blame to others as an excuse for the illegal arrest of overseas Chinese in Saigon. It is believed that the Saigon US consular authorities will not be blinded by the Japanese side's slander" (26th dispatch).

### Stationed in Shanghai for Fourteen Years, the US Army's Second Battalion Retires by Ship This Morning; Citizens Cheer as They Parade Farewell; American Women and Children Leave Shanghai Together

The Second Troop Carrier, the Harrison, Entered Port Yesterday

The US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment, which has been stationed in Shanghai for fourteen years, has received orders to withdraw. The first batch to withdraw is the Second Battalion of the Regiment and a portion of the headquarters, which will board the US troop carrier President Madison at around 10:00 this morning and leave for the journey in the afternoon with about a hundred American civilians who are also withdrawing. It is reported that the second troop carrier, the President Harrison, entered port at around 4:00 PM yesterday (26th), mooring at buoys 12 and 13 to carry the second batch of withdrawing American soldiers and civilians, and may leave port on Sunday evening. The ship was originally a global liner of the American President Lines. This time, it was ordered to come to Shanghai to evacuate civilians and transport troops. In addition to carrying over two thousand tons of goods from the United States, there were also eighty-four passengers from the United States to Shanghai.

Boarding Begins at 9:00 AM Today

The withdrawal of more than three hundred officers and men of the Second Battalion of the US Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai, which has been postponed twice, has been decided to take place today, led by the Regiment's Executive Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Curtis, on the US liner President Madison to retreat south to Manila. At 9:00 AM this morning, the Second Battalion will depart from Xiaoshadu Road and parade to Gordon Road, turn into Jing'an Temple Road, and follow Nanjing Road to the Bund, reaching the New Customs Wharf to take a ferry to the troop transport. The parade will take about an hour. The US garrison string orchestra will accompany the parade, playing music. At that time, Colonel Howard and others will lead all the officers and men of the First Battalion, who are scheduled to withdraw on Sunday, at the rear. In order to maintain traffic, the police will strengthen their presence in the Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road area this morning to prevent any incidents. This situation is the same as when the British army withdrew last year, with everyone in the city gathering on the streets to see them off. The exact time of the President Madison's departure has not been announced, but judging from the fact that the last ferry is scheduled to leave the New Customs Wharf at 12:00 PM, the ship will set sail for Manila at around 2:00 PM.

American Women and Children Leave Shanghai Together

Since the US Consulate General declared that the policy of evacuating civilians remains unchanged, American residents in Shanghai, seeing that the situation is turbulent, are making plans to withdraw for safety. It has been found that nearly two hundred American residents have registered to withdraw and have purchased tickets, of which women and children account for 80%, and the rest are men who do not need to stay or are leaving Shanghai for other reasons. According to the American President Lines, more than a hundred American residents will travel with the US Second Battalion on the President Madison today, and more than a hundred will also withdraw on the Harrison on Sunday. Yesterday morning, the shipping company's passenger department officially announced that the Madison will leave Shanghai today, and the last ferry will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 12:00 PM. The sailing time of the troop transport could not be determined, but the first destination is Manila. The itinerary after arriving in the Philippines is kept strictly secret.

Six Officers Promoted Yesterday

Six officers of the US Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai were promoted one rank each yesterday by order of the Washington Navy Corps Selection Office. They include Social Officer Major Hamilton promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. Hamilton is well-known in Shanghai social circles, and people congratulated him yesterday. First Battalion Executive Officer Major Flinn was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. Flinn is the team's sports officer and has made great contributions to the team's sports activities over the past fourteen years. Group Affairs Training Officer Captain Xueke was promoted to Major. The remaining three are William, First Battalion "A One Camp" Landis, and Second Battalion, E Camp Bartley, all promoted to Major from Captain.

### Police Department Takes Over Area B

After the White Russian squad of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was transferred to the Public Concession Police Department in January, the other squads of the Volunteer Corps were ordered to garrison Area B of the Public Concession and dispatched volunteers to guard three sentry posts. It was not until 6:00 PM the day before yesterday (25th) that they withdrew from Area B and were taken over by the Police Department. Officials stated yesterday morning that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, which was relieved of its garrison and patrol duties in Area B of the Public Concession on the 25th, will still be dispatched for patrols at any time, and in an emergency, it will definitely rush to Area B and Area C to assist in everything. Currently, the Police Department has completely taken over Area B, so the Volunteer Corps has no definite duty to maintain security for the time being. The garrison duties at the Waibaidu Bridge and other places in Area B have been taken over by the Police Department since 6:00 PM on the 25th. After the withdrawal of the US troops, Area B and Area C will be under the sole jurisdiction of the Police Department, with the Volunteer Corps as backup. In the event of an emergency, the Police Department will call on other defense forces in the Public Concession for assistance.

Huishi Police Station Takes Over Defense

Currently, the diplomatic officers of the countries concerned in the Public Concession have absolutely agreed that the maintenance of security in the Public Concession does not require the stationing of any foreign troops. The organization of the Public Concession Police Department is perfect and has sufficient ability to maintain security in the Public Concession. Even if it is occasionally necessary, the Municipal Council can convene the Volunteer Corps at any time to assist. Therefore, after the withdrawal of the US defense forces this time, the authorities concerned in the Public Concession have agreed to have the Police Department take over the defense. At the same time, the northern part of Area A, the original Public Concession, that is, the area north of Suzhou Creek from North Henan Road to North Xizang Road, the Municipal Council, according to the decision of the authorities concerned, ordered the withdrawal of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps stationed there at 6:00 AM yesterday, and handed it over to the Huishi Police Station of the Police Department to take over the defense, and the handover was completed at that time. The Northern District Headquarters of the Volunteer Corps, located in the First Special District Court, was also evacuated yesterday morning. The defense of the First Special District Court is also protected by a large number of patrol officers sent by the Police Department. It is found that the British defense forces withdrew from that place last year, and the AB Second Battalions of the Volunteer Corps took over the defense. Yesterday, the entire Volunteer Corps was demobilized and could be convened at any time to assist the Police Department in maintaining security in the original defense areas of the British and American troops.

Thirty Japanese Police Officers to Come to Shanghai

The Japanese "Mainland New Report" stated that thirty Japanese police officers who passed a special examination in Tokyo and Fukuoka in October will arrive in Shanghai in mid-December to serve in the Public Concession Police Department.

British Residents Bid Farewell to Each Other

British resident groups in the city held a public banquet for Mr. Howard and other officers. The president of the British resident association first blessed the British Emperor and President Roosevelt, then delivered a brief speech stating, "Today is one of the most tragic days in Shanghai, because the US Marine Corps, who have been our friends for fourteen years, are about to leave us." Afterwards, in addition to expressing reluctance to part, he also said that the US military's departure from Shanghai today is by no means abandoning their obligations, but clearing the deck to prepare for action. Although we cannot bear to watch them leave, we do not want them to change their minds and not go. During the banquet, a silver plate was presented to Mr. Howard, engraved with the words "Presented to All Officers of the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment, From the British Resident Groups in Shanghai." After receiving this gift, Mr. Howard gave a speech in reply, saying, "In the last great war, Britain and the United States were cousins, and today they have become brothers. In the future, they will go further and fight side by side like brothers in the same company." It is heard that the St. George's General Association will also hold a public banquet for Mr. Howard and others at the Shanghai Club today.

### Water and Electricity Prices Change; Public Concession Changes Adjustment Fee and Surcharge Method; French Water and Electricity and Public Transportation Also Increase Prices

The Shanghai Electric Power Company of the Public Concession has modified its notification regarding electricity surcharges. The original text reads: "With the consent of the Shanghai Municipal Council and this company, for ordinary users whose electricity usage period ends in December 1941, the fuel adjustment fee and various basic charges (including electricity price, appliance rental fee, and various service fees) to be added to their bills are as follows: Fuel adjustment fee: 1.614 cents per kilowatt-hour; Temporary surcharge: 200%."

French Water and Electricity Prices Next Month

The French Tramway and Electric Light Company notified users in the concession, "This company notifies all water and electricity users and passengers that changes in water, electricity, and fare prices will take effect on December 1, 1941. Electricity: 6 jiao per kilowatt-hour; Power (below 10 horsepower): 3.8 jiao per kilowatt-hour; Power (above 10 horsepower): 3.7 jiao per kilowatt-hour; Electric heat: 3.6 jiao per kilowatt-hour; Tap water: 3.6 jiao per cubic foot. The revised new prices for trams, trolleybuses, and buses will take effect on December 1, 1941. The new price list is posted in each vehicle for public reference."

### Second Phase of Rice Collection Sale Registration Deadline

The Shanghai Rice Industry Association began registering for the second phase of collective rice sales yesterday. Because the number of rice stores that went to register was very large, the registration was closed at 3:00 PM. Those who did not register will be transferred to the next phase. The Rice Industry Association is rushing to compile statistics and report them to the Food Management Committee of the Municipal Council before issuing rice transportation permits.

Cereal Association Halts Operations

The Shanghai Oilcake and Cereal Association at 15 Edward Road has been at a standstill since the takeover incident. It is expected that this incident will have no impact on the local rice market, as all the rice in the city has been controlled by the authorities. Although national rice can be operated privately, the quantity is small, and most of it is traded in the Simalu Rice Industry Tea House Market, so members do not need to operate there.

### Mingsheng Wheel Requisition Suspended; Still Withdrawn by Anhui Wheel

The British Consulate General announced yesterday morning that the plan previously formulated by the British authorities to evacuate some British residents from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the Mingsheng wheel, and then change to another wheel to Australia, has now been cancelled. These evacuating British residents will switch to the Anhui wheel to depart for Hong Kong, and then change wheels to Australia. The Anhui wheel will carry other evacuating British residents to India and other places as previously planned. At the same time, British residents who have registered for evacuation but have not gone to the consulate to complete passport verification procedures are now rushing to complete these procedures. The British Consulate has also announced that those who have not completed this will have their registration cancelled and will not be given another chance to register.

### Jianshe Wheel in Moji; Secret Dredging

According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiries with the Customs, the Jianshe wheel had already arrived in Moji after leaving Shanghai. However, the Japanese military port project only began last week. During the day, the ship was berthed outside the port of Moji, and only entered the port at night to dredge. Therefore, apart from the Japanese, the crew members of the ship had no way of knowing the area being dredged.

Efficiency Reduced

Because the Jianshe wheel is a specialized technical vessel, the efficiency of use varies greatly depending on the long-term training of personnel. The current shipowner, Kolosrai (Norwegian), has newly recruited crew members who are not skilled, so he feels very棘手 in all aspects of dragging, sucking, dredging, and driving. According to his telegram, there is an intention to urge the old crew members to come and assist.

Russian Staff Rejected

The ship's mate, because he is Russian, the Japanese are deeply afraid of leaking the port's secrets, so they do not want him to go with the ship. The Russian mate also does not want to work for the Japanese, and the bureau has reassigned him to the Lilang Surveying Ship as the shipowner. As for the bureau's other dredger in Germany, the Fuxing, it has been converted into a transport ship by the Germans. The bureau telegraphed Berlin to negotiate, and the reply was to allow rental fees for temporary lease. Reuter, Tokyo, 26th - According to Japanese sources in Tianjin, thirty-four British residents, mostly women and children, left Tianjin for Shanghai this morning. Together with the British residents previously evacuated from Tianjin, there are a total of seventy-two people. Several more British residents will leave Tianjin for Shanghai by train in the next two days.

### British Residents in Tianjin Come to Shanghai

Reuter's Shanghai news, the British Embassy announced that the plan previously proposed to evacuate some British to Australia by the Mingsheng boat to Hong Kong to change boats has now been cancelled, and the British originally scheduled to take the Mingsheng boat will change to the Anhui boat to Hong Kong, and then change other boats to Australia, and the other British scheduled to evacuate to India and other places will also leave Shanghai by the Anhui boat. Reuter, Tianjin, 26th - The US Consulate today reiterated the advice that American residents in North China should evacuate, and at the same time, the Yuezhou ship has left for Shanghai with evacuating British residents this morning. US officials here still do not know the date of departure of the US Marine Corps in North China.

### Construction of Beggar Camp by Zhongshan Road: Plan Abandoned, Corpse Discovered Daily in Cold Weather; Expansion of Singapore Road Shelter Proposed

The two concession authorities in this city, in order to eliminate beggars within their boundaries, recently established a subcommittee in cooperation with the Salvation Army and Rotary Club to prepare for the establishment of a large beggar shelter. In mid-October, when the committee convened, representatives from the downtown area of the city also attended and proposed a plan to convert houses on Zhongshan Road on the outskirts of the city into a beggar shelter, which seemed promising. However, according to sources within the responsible party, the city center has now

rejected this proposal

and notified the chairman of the committee that the houses on Zhongshan Road have been allocated for other purposes. The above plan has therefore been overturned. It is not yet known whether representatives from the two concession authorities, the Salvation Army, and the Rotary Club will convene a special meeting as a result. However, since the weather has turned cold and corpses are being discovered on the streets daily, providing relief to beggars is an urgent matter. Therefore, the responsible parties are currently preparing a plan to expand the Salvation Army beggar shelter on Singapore Road. Once the plan is finalized, it will be immediately submitted to the Public Works Department for approval, so that it can be

realized within the year,

adding capacity for several thousand beggars. Currently, the Salvation Army's pastoral shelter can accommodate a maximum of 1,500 beggars, and it is already full.

### Tenants of Qunxian Villa Appeal for Assistance

Landlords in Shanghai who own lane houses are eyeing the houses within the Second Cheng district. Demand exceeds supply, and they believe they can make a fortune. They are coming up with tricks to sell lane houses unit by unit, wildly inflating house prices, forcing old tenants to move out by increasing rents, and attracting new tenants, taking kickbacks and demanding exorbitant transfer fees, often amounting to tens of thousands. As a result, tenants in general are panicked. Recently, the sale of units has been occurring constantly, and rental disputes are becoming increasingly serious. The forced eviction of tenants from Qunxian Villa on Rue du Père Huc is even worse. Since Shanghai was opened as a port, there has never been an example of lane houses being sold unit by unit. A lane should be a unit, with only thin walls separating the units. Dividing them into fragments is simply improper. This spring, the houses were sold unit by unit on a trial basis, putting undue pressure on tenants and giving them deadlines to move out. Recently, numbers 3, 4, 12, 34, and 38 of the lane were again coerced by a group, followed by intimidation. All the tenants are deeply panicked and hope that the wise concession authorities will take remedial measures to maintain order and tranquility.

### Supplementary List of Price-Controlled Items

Products of Ke Da Company: Jifu brand large can of evaporated milk, 2 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen per can; Baoshige tonic juice, 12-liang bottle, 15 yuan per bottle; Baoshige tonic juice, 5-liang bottle, 7 yuan 5 jiao per bottle; Su Sheng medicated soap, 1 li per piece, 2 yuan 5 jiao; 2 li per piece, 3 yuan; special cup-shaped shaving soap, 1 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen per piece; special dog soap, 2 yuan 5 jiao per piece.

### Amendment to Public Works Department Regulations on Ambulance Fees

(B) Infectious diseases: Residents within the Public Concession and on roads outside the boundary may be sent to the hospital free of charge, but if the patient is taken out of the hospital, the above fee schedule in section A shall apply; residents outside the Public Concession or on roads outside the boundary shall be charged according to the above fee schedule in section A, whether they are sent to or taken out of the hospital.

### News of Postage Increase

### Eliminating Profiteering: Action to Be Launched Soon; Authorities to Announce Third Batch of Price-Controlled Items Soon, Based on Powers Granted by the Consular Body

Some unscrupulous merchants are still taking advantage of the various goods whose prices have already been fixed by the Public Works Department to make profits. The department prepared yesterday morning to eliminate these merchants within a few days.

Hongkou Area to Be Controlled Soon

At the same time, it is expected that the Japanese authorities will soon take concrete measures to control prices in the Hongkou district. This shows that the authorities will launch a second step to curb rising prices to consolidate the results they have already achieved. A spokesman for the Public Works Department said that the department is currently collecting information on merchants who are still seeking to profit and will quickly punish them based on the powers granted by the Consular Body. The department has already set prices for a variety of goods and will ensure that they are fully implemented. Violators will be severely punished.

Profiteering Has Not Been Eradicated

The department has received fewer reports of rice merchants still profiteering, but more reports of profiteering in other goods. The department is currently expediting the setting of prices for more goods, which will be announced soon in the form of a third price list. The Public Works Department has received an application from importers in this city to import 10,000 bags of flour and is currently discussing it and awaiting a reply from the United States. Representatives from various Japanese government and civilian organizations in Shanghai met yesterday at the Japanese General Association to discuss plans to control prices in Hongkou.

Continuing to Order 100,000 Bags of Foreign Flour

In response to the requests of various flour users and in order to suppress flour prices and stabilize the flour market, the Public Works Department is planning to purchase a large quantity of flour and sell it in Shanghai at affordable prices. The first batch of 64,000 bags, valued at 1 million yuan in national currency, is said to be on its way to Shanghai and will arrive here soon. It will be sold at a flat rate of 35 or 36 yuan per bag to legitimate users. It is now reported that the Public Works Department, to take matters a step further, has decided to continue to order 100,000 bags of foreign flour, valued at 3.5 million yuan in national currency, and has commissioned various import firms to telegraph Canadian firms to negotiate the purchase. Once the negotiations are completed, it will be loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai. At that time, the flour panic in this port will be easily resolved.

### Zhejiang Ships Cease Quarantine

In addition, starting from the 20th day of the lunar month, white porridge will be distributed as usual at 5 p.m., limited to 2,000 people.

The association has been carrying out various charitable deeds throughout the year, benefiting the poor. It is especially concerned about the poor during the winter months, which is truly a blessing for the refugees. It is said that the financial resources are insufficient, and it is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will provide continuous support so that it can continue without interruption.

### Half-Sisters Commit Evil; Zhou Commits Assault and Is Imprisoned; Reportedly Seeking Revenge for Her Mother, Stabbing Her Sister, the Traitor, Sentenced to Three Years in Prison and Ordered to Pay Medical Expenses

Peng Junxiang, a native of Henan, died many years ago. He married one wife and one concubine, each of whom bore him a daughter. Later, the concubine also died. At that time, her daughter was only seven years old and was raised by the principal wife, Han. When she turned seventeen, due to pressing circumstances, she entered Chen Meiyu's brothel in Huile Lane on Yunnan Road as a prostitute, with the professional name A Yuan. After four years, she was redeemed by a patron, Tongfeng Glass Factory and Tongrun Villa owner Cai Mingxian, who took her as a concubine and lived with her at No. 8, Lane 434, Avenue Edward VII. This has been going on for four years, and she has borne two sons. However, after Peng Han's daughter

married a Zhou,

they lived together for several years. Unexpectedly, Zhou fell ill and died three years ago. Therefore, Han relied on the life of her concubine daughter Cai Peng. On September 11 of this year, Peng Han suddenly committed suicide by taking poison. Her daughter Zhou Peng, who lived far away in Yangshupu, did not know the cause of death at the time. Later, she learned that her mother had actually been abused by her sister Cai Peng, causing her to commit suicide out of grief and indignation. Therefore, the intention to kill arose suddenly, wanting to avenge her mother. In advance, she purchased a sharp kitchen knife on Avenue Joffre and hid it. On the day after her mother's seventh day memorial, October 30, Zhou Peng hid the knife and went to her sister's house,

pretending to chat and laugh.

She invited her sister to listen to a performance at the Dongfang Theater. After the performance, she claimed that it was close to curfew and she could not return to Yangshupu, so she stayed overnight at Cai Peng's house. At 1:50 a.m., she suddenly got up and used the pre-hidden knife to slash Cai Peng wildly, causing a total of fourteen cuts to her head and body. She screamed in pain. Zhou Peng also went to the Xin Zha Police Station to declare everything. Chinese Detective Weng Peiyu went to the scene of the incident to investigate and transported the injured to Hongren Hospital for treatment. He also ordered Zhou Peng to be detained and sent to the First Special Court the next morning for interrogation, which was postponed to another date. Cai

Peng's injuries

have mostly healed. Yesterday morning, Zhou Peng was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted her for attempted murder and described the case. Cai Peng then complained that she was raised by the defendant's mother from the age of seven and was forced into prostitution at the age of seventeen. She then married Cai Mingxian as a concubine. Han usually lived in my house. I don't know why she committed suicide by taking poison. She also described the circumstances of being slashed and injured and hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to come to court to bring a civil lawsuit, requesting the return of medical expenses of 577 yuan. When questioned, the defendant Zhou Peng confessed that my mother was actually abused by her sister,

angered and poisoned,

resulting in death. I was compelled by justice to avenge my mother. Beforehand, I abandoned my own daughter. After my mother's seventh day memorial, I implemented the predetermined steps. It is fortunate that she did not die, and so on. Finally, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant's daughter had now been found and was temporarily staying at the Jiliang Institute. After mutual debate with Fei Xiubo, the lawyer appointed to defend the defendant pro bono, Judge Zhong sentenced Zhou Peng for attempted murder to three years of imprisonment and ordered her to pay Cai Peng's medical expenses of 577 yuan. The kitchen knife was confiscated.

### Director of Ke Mei Hospital Indicted for Obstructing Morality; Zhou Huili Evades Appearance; Shen Zhiying Requests Arrest Warrant

Zhou Huili, 46 years old, a Ningbo native, residing at No. 90, Bubbling Well Road, is the director of Ke Mei Obstetrics Hospital and has opened many branches in this port. In 1936, when the third branch on Rue Ratard was opened, Zhou advertised and hired Shen Zhiying, a woman from Songjiang, as a nurse at the hospital. Zhou Huili, seeing that Shen was beautiful, harbored improper thoughts and showed Shen great courtesy. In addition to her service at the hospital, he also paid for her to attend school. Soon, Zhou asked Shen for favors, but was unsuccessful. In 1937, he hired a matchmaker and obtained the consent of Shen's mother to hold an engagement ceremony at Tongxinglou. He was then able to have a relationship with Shen at the Rue Ratard hospital under the guise of being her fiancé. The woman then became pregnant, and he incited Shen to have an abortion, which Shen refused. In 1938, Shen gave birth to a son, who was taken away by Zhou after the birth. He then falsely claimed that the child had died, making it impossible for the biological mother and son to meet. Zhou's purpose having been achieved, his feelings for Shen faded day by day, and he put the matter of marriage out of his mind. Recently, he actually expelled Shen. Unable to bear it any longer, she reported Zhou Huili to the French Concession Police for obstructing morality. Zhou Huili was ordered to appear once but did not. Yesterday, a public investigation was conducted, and Zhou again evaded appearance. The plaintiff, Shen Zhiying, requested that an arrest warrant be issued to arrest Zhou for investigation.

Today they will change their strategy against Lianxing and fight to the death to avenge their humiliation. In the second game, Shanghai Star will meet Paramount. Paramount's main players Feng Nianhua and Chen Xianglong were unable to participate in the previous game, and Qu Xilin's脱幅 led to Lianxing's assault.

They defeated Paramount heavily in the semi-finals the night before, demonstrating their strength. In addition to Chen Xuechong, Kong Guangyi, and Tao Boxiuji, the famous Shanghai athlete Carson is also among their warriors. Carson will soon return to Shanghai from the United States. Fulian was organized by veteran players like Dong Xiaopei and includes Tao Shaosheng, Zou Ziren, Song Qihou, Dong Yangfeng, He Xiaoguang, etc. Under Dong's leadership and command, they are sure to perform well in the future.

### Bank Buying Intentions Weaken Suddenly, Recalling the Gold Market with Dismay

Yesterday, the cash gold market was dim, and the unprecedented sharp decline suddenly intensified again. The price broke through the 14,000 yuan mark, and everyone's confidence was weakened. Bank buying intentions suddenly weakened, and with the continued loosening of foreign exchange, selling rumors became prevalent. Although Cheng Ji bought 300 taels, and Tongkang, Yongcheng, and Securities each bought several tens of taels, Tianrong sold 300 taels, Xiangxing and Yong (Chaozhou gang) sold 260 taels, and Mingfeng Shunyuan also competed to sell. Retail investors followed the trend and sold even more fiercely. The price plummeted from 14,700 yuan to 13,300 yuan, a drop of another 1,130 yuan. Trading was light throughout the day, with a total of 13,400 taels traded in the morning and afternoon.

Cash Has Fallen for Six Consecutive Days

The opening price this morning for each bar (10 taels) was 14,400 yuan, a decrease of 80 yuan. Xianghe and Yongcheng bought and raised the price to 14,700 yuan. Soon after, Xianghe suddenly reappeared to sell, and Tianyuan, Shunyuan, Deda, Decheng, Chengda, and Mingfeng successively competed to sell. The market price gradually declined by 800 yuan, again falling within 14,000 yuan. There were few transactions, with the lowest price being 13,800 yuan. Tongkang, Yong, Chengji, Zhongxing, and Tianyuan and Dafengshou absorbed the selling, and the price started to rebound, rising by 650 yuan to 14,450 yuan. Xianghe, Xiangxingyong, and Hesheng sold a small amount of 200 yuan, falling back to 14,250 yuan. The morning closed at 14,300 yuan. The afternoon opened at 2:00 PM at 14,200 yuan, and Tianyuan bought alone, rising to 14,350 yuan. Immediately, it could not sustain the rise and plummeted. Gonghe, Dingsheng, Tianyuan, Defu, Yifeng, Xiangxingyong, and Chengda competed to sell, and the price gradually fell by 1,050 yuan to 13,300 yuan. Xianghe, Shunyuan, and Yongcheng bought, raising the price to 13,600 yuan. Soon after, it fell again, and Yifeng and Xiangxingyong sold again. The market closed at 4:00 PM at 13,350 yuan, a drop of another 1,130 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been falling for six consecutive days, with a total sharp drop of 6,180 yuan. The price difference on the day was 1,400 yuan. The retail price of cash gold was 13,500 yuan, and the purchase price was 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.

Jewelry Gold Drops Another 130 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at Da Tonghang and Xin Tonghang was lowered by 40 yuan in the morning and then lowered twice by 90 yuan in the afternoon, to 1,360 yuan (purchase price reduced by 150 yuan), a drop of 130 yuan. Silver Sycee remained at 22 yuan, and the black market price was 16.5 yuan.

### Black Market Exchange Rate Loosens Again, Foreign Currency Declines

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC and the Central Bank post the same rates as before. The counter rates at HSBC and other smaller banks were also flat. The black market rates for British and American currency continued to loosen slightly. The Banque de l'Indochine sold nearly 1,000 US dollars at a price of 3.75 yuan, settled by a certain import company. Chinese merchants and speculators were also eager to sell. At noon, there were no buyers. The noon closing rate for British currency also loosened to 2/16s 4.375, and US dollars could be settled at 3.75 yuan, a decrease of 0.0625 for British currency and 0.125 for US currency compared to the previous day's closing rate. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds fall by another 20 yuan. The supply of British gold notes was also strong, and the market price was weak. US gold notes once fell to 26 yuan, and the final price was 26 yuan and a corner, a drop of 9 corners compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes also trended lower. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes continued to fall, with the former falling to 1 yuan and 6 corners and the latter falling to 2 yuan and 8 corners. In addition, currencies such as Singapore, Annam, Canada, the Philippines, and Australian gold notes also trended lower.

### Bulls Forced to Liquidate, Double Horse Yarn Deteriorates Daily, Factory Orders Seen at 2390 Yuan

The yarn market started flat and then declined, and confidence remained weak. This was because the fall in gold allowed the bears to be active. The bulls, seeing the unfavorable environment, were forced to liquidate, so the market remained soft. However, major players were still struggling on the bull side. The highest price for 20s Double Horse was 2560 yuan, and the lowest price was 2455 yuan. The market opened weakly in the afternoon, and with the subsequent fall in gold, the yarn and cloth market on the exchange turned downward. Selling pressure was strong on the trading floor, and the market became increasingly unsustainable. The opening price was 2480 yuan, falling directly to 2435 yuan. It rebounded to 2470 yuan in the middle, and the closing price fell again to 2390 yuan. The closing price was 2400 yuan.

Double Horse opened peacefully in the morning, with the opening price at 2540 yuan. Major players continued to buy, and the price rose to 2560 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange opened very weakly, and the situation deteriorated with the poor performance of gold. The price fell to 2460 yuan. As the price was low, the bulls became active, and the bears covered their positions. The market turned up to 2525 yuan, but the closing price was 2503 yuan. The total transaction volume for half a day was 2850 bales.

The futures market for Jin Double Horse continued to be weak, and confidence was unstable. Major players increased their selling, and many bears also sold off. The market gradually declined and trended downward. The morning opening saw factory orders rise once, with the December contract opening at a high price of 2550 yuan, the January contract at 2530 yuan, and the February contract at 2650 yuan. Although the distant contracts rose slightly with the gold market at one point, they were ultimately pressured down due to the struggle between the bulls and the bears. The afternoon saw factory orders continue to be weak, and confidence weakened further. In addition, the exchange turned weak, further weakening the market's ability to rise. Therefore, the near-term contract fell to 2410 yuan, the January contract fell to 2455 yuan, and the February contract fell to 2550 yuan. Although it rebounded slightly near the close, the near-term contract ultimately fell by 60 yuan, the January contract fell by 45 yuan, and the February contract fell by 65 yuan. The table is listed below:

December   January    February

Open   2530.0  2530.0  2605.0

High   2530.0  2560.0  2630.0

Low    2410.0  2455.0  2505.0

Close  2420.0  2480.0  255.0

Change  Down 60.0 Down 45.0 Down 65.0

### Cotton Market Stagnates

The current cotton situation has stagnated with the yarn market.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to a large number of bulls liquidating and cotton merchants selling to lock in profits. It then rebounded due to industry hedging and purchases by cash merchants and New Orleans. As a result, the closing prices rose by 7 to 8 points per pound or more compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially advanced slightly due to the stock market and other domestic raw material markets rising strongly. However, it then fell back due to a large number of cotton merchants selling to lock in profits and floating bulls selling off. As a result, yesterday's closing prices fell by about 3 to 4 rupees. It is predicted that today's opening market will rise by 1.75 rupees due to the strength of American cotton.

### Piece Goods Trend Weak

The factory cloth market is trending weak due to poor sales and falling gold prices, which has weakened confidence. However, as factories have not been releasing goods for a long time, prices remain high. Hand goods are being rushed to sell off due to the end of the month, so the market is uneven. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill fell by 1 to 4 yuan. Dyed cloth factory orders remained the same. Hand goods fell by 2 to 3 yuan in scattered amounts. More than 400 pieces were transacted in the main street. More than 100 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and fine cloth were ordered by the Ningbo and Dinghai gangs from eastern Zhejiang.

The East cloth market is weak, and selling is still prevalent. The morning opening for the December contract for colored ball fine cloth futures on the exchange was 87 yuan 9 corners and 9 points. The afternoon closing was 82 yuan 5 corners, a drop of 4 yuan compared to the previous day. The January opening was 90 yuan, and the closing was 84 yuan 5 corners, a drop of 4 yuan 5 corners. The decline in the spot market was even more severe. The highest price for Longtou fine cloth factory orders in the morning was 91 yuan 5 corners, and the after-market price was 85 yuan 7 corners and a half. Opening prices fell to 85 yuan, but it was still difficult to sell out. Sijunzi Serge had a high price of 3 yuan 3 corners and 3 points, but it plummeted to 3 yuan 1 corner and 7 and a half points at the afternoon closing.

### Bond Market Difficult to Be Optimistic About for Now

The over-the-counter market for public bonds yesterday saw the previous hopes dashed as negotiations between Japan and the United States were limited to the Pacific Incident and did not address the China-Japan issue. Those who were long on public bonds sold off. The so-called atmosphere of peace disappeared. In addition, it is difficult to predict whether other events will occur after the withdrawal of American troops from the city. The multiple sides lost their basis and their front lines gradually shook. The future is difficult to be optimistic about for now. The opening price for C bonds in the morning was still 70 yuan, but it was soon broken. The low price was 9 yuan 5 corners and a half. Tongkang, Jiufeng, and Hongda were buying in the market, while the amount sold by Dazhong was very high. Shengxing, Tongyi, and Lianyi were all sellers, and the market atmosphere was clearly depressed. In the afternoon, Jiuquan continued to buy, and Runde also had quantity. Tongyi continued to sell, and the sales of Dingkang and Yitai were also very high. The low price for C bonds was again seen at 9 yuan 3 corners and a half. Popular sentiment has slackened, and the courage of the multiple sides has diminished. As a result, they unanimously continued to drop by 4 corners to 8 and a half corners, with a turnover of approximately 1.4 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category   Highest  Lowest  Close  Compared to Day

Unified A 77.00  78.65  6.70 Down 0.40

Unified B 71.60  71.10  71.30 Loss 0.60

Unified C 70.00  69.35  69.40 Also 0.6

Unified D 67.25  66.80  66.80 Also 0.70

Unified E 68.85  68.20  68.20 Also 0.85

In stock trading, 200 shares of Wing On Company were traded at a price of 52 and a half yuan.

The public industry stock market has stabilized. The opening price was the same as the previous close. Popular sentiment was still good after the opening, and prices slowly rose. There were many people selling at high prices, but the market recovered quickly, and the closing trend was upward.

The Board of Directors of British United Dockyards Limited decided yesterday to cut off the final dividend for the year ending September 1941, at 3 yuan per share, and to add a bonus of 2 yuan per share. It will be distributed as soon as this year's shareholders' meeting is held.

London, 25th (Tuesday) Telegraph Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British companies in the Far East remain flat. HSBC Bank British Registered shares rose by 1 pound alone, with the price at 81 pounds. There were no other changes.

### Grain Prices in Stagnation

Yesterday, foreign rice remained as silent as ever. National rice had sporadic small amounts on the wharves in Hongkou. New transactions were observing the situation due to rumors of price limits, and importers were waiting. The market was also in a standstill.

Foreign flour customers and wholesalers were holding back, and transactions for flour from the East Wharves were lacking both imports and exports. However, it was heard that wholesalers who directly distributed to customers had similar trades to before. The market for imported flour in Puxi was slightly more active due to the increase in actual consumption in this street. A total of 1450 packages were transacted throughout the day. However, it was heard that there was a price limit of 35-36 yuan for cheap foreign flour, and Jinlong Bank Wharf also lowered it by 1 yuan to 37 yuan. The Shanghai Feng Wharf was 37 yuan and 2 corners to 37 yuan and a half. American Flour Five Swallow Brand opened at 40 yuan. Wheat bran was being resold by customers and wholesalers, and small packages were reduced by 1 to 2 yuan to 55 yuan. Orchid customers sold out at 52 yuan, also a reduction of 1 to 2 yuan. Wheat was scarce, and it was still called 72 yuan.

### Soybeans Flood in, Falling Another 3-4 Yuan

Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market remained lackluster. Edible oil was firm at the beginning but weak at the end due to many retail investors selling off. Soybeans, however, were overwhelmed with supplies, and the owners were selling off, causing prices to be unsustainable, falling another 3-4 yuan. Corn was flat but weak. The unified market sold 30 barrels of Qingdao crude oil, 100 barrels of Dasu soybean oil, and 10 barrels of Tianjin light oil. Tianjin sold 370 packages of New Golden Knife, 200 packages of green beans, and a carload of Changzhou cowhide yellow. There were nearly 1,000 packages of corn spot goods and more than 200 tons of futures.

### Sales and Arrivals Come Together, Sugar Market Unable to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market showed signs of rising after opening, but unexpectedly, a certain major wholesaler suddenly sold off, causing confidence to weaken. As a result, it fell by another 4-5 yuan compared to the previous market. For example, No. 24 coarse white spot goods for the current month opened at 204 yuan in the morning, rose 11 yuan, and fell back to 06 yuan. In the afternoon, it was 203 yuan to 09 yuan, eventually closing at 02 yuan. The October contract opened at 203 yuan to 210 yuan in the morning, fell to 02 yuan, and in the afternoon, it was 200 yuan to 07 yuan, returning to 200 yuan. The September contract was 20 yuan in the morning and 197 yuan in the afternoon. In the afternoon, it was 196 yuan, 205 yuan, and 198 yuan. August opened at 200 yuan to 191 yuan in the morning, and in the afternoon, it was 192 yuan, 200 yuan, and 195 yuan. The November 30th futures contract opened at 192 yuan to 87 yuan in the morning, and 190 yuan in the afternoon. The December 10th contract opened at 199 yuan in the morning and 207 yuan in the afternoon. Hong Kong coarse opened at 188 yuan to 184 yuan in the morning and 185 yuan in the afternoon. Dutch red opened at 170 yuan to 67 and a half yuan in the morning, and still closed at 170 yuan in the afternoon. In total, more than 9,000 packages of spot goods and more than 5,000 packages of futures were transacted throughout the day.

The arrival of sugar in Shanghai is very strong. Recent reports have been continuously reported. It is now learned that Taikoo Company's Taiyuan wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, transporting 5,800 packages of sand sugar from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the Bente Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession.

### White Coal Arrives at 1,000 Tons

Small Coal Dust in Transit in Large Quantities

In the white coal market, amidst the decline in gold prices and the loosening of foreign exchange, confidence is low. Wholesalers are eager to sell but have no buyers. The over-the-counter price hovers around 700 yuan, with very little fluctuation. New goods are arriving one after another. Baoduo Foreign Company recently received 1,000 tons of Hongji white coal, which was the first arrival this month and has already been unloaded. The market price has not yet been announced. The subsequent goods, small coal dust, are in transit in large quantities and will arrive in succession.

### Hardware Sales Difficult to Expand

Huis steel is the sole raw material for can factories, toy factories, printing factories, etc. in this street. Recently, because the market price of this commodity has exceeded 1,000 yuan, buyers are hesitant to purchase it easily. As a result, actual sales have been greatly affected. However, those holding the goods are still unwilling to let go easily, so the standard market price is still 1,300 yuan per box (200 pounds).

US Strips Steel is the second grade of US Huis steel. Although factories are shifting to narrower steel because of the high price of Huis steel, the selling price of the narrower steel is not particularly low. Yesterday, it still had to sell for about 1,000 yuan per 200 pounds. Therefore, it is difficult for procurement to be lavish, no wonder sales are sluggish.

### Daily Necessities Gradually Return to Normal

Since the authorities strictly managed prices for cigarettes, matches, candles, and soap, ordinary wholesalers could no longer use their tricks and suffered heavy losses. The cigarette market and other markets are also loosening. As factories continue to supply goods, wholesalers are divided on whether prices will rise or fall. Therefore, prices have recently plateaued, and all goods have entered the right track.

### Radio Treatment of Diseases

— Wen Zaiyang

X-rays are an important tool in medicine, and now everyone knows it. But can radio listeners know that radio waves, which transmit distant sounds to their ears, can also treat diseases?

X-rays and radio waves are both called electromagnetic waves, but radio waves are invisible, while X-rays can be seen through fluorescent screens. As for the strong effects of shortwave and ultra-shortwave radio on living organisms, scientists have pointed this out long ago.

Soviet biologists began to systematically study the effects of ultra-shortwave radio eight years ago. In the early stages, ultra-shortwave therapy faced great difficulties in properly adjusting and controlling its electrical energy. The National Hospital invented the "Moscow Method" to overcome this difficulty, which can very accurately calculate the energy of electromagnetic waves emitted to the patient, but this method is too cumbersome and complex.

Leningrad scientist Taitaringov invented a simpler method, but the wavelength of the waves used cannot be less than nine meters.

Regarding the treatment of what kind of diseases, according to the results of the research by Lakhmanov and others, ultra-shortwave can quickly heal wounds. It is also said that the use of ultra-shortwave within the appropriate period can prevent the spread of poison in the wound, and also that this method can accelerate the healing of festering wounds.

Soviet scientists have also invented the use of ultra-shortwave radio to treat frostbite. In the early stages of frostbite, it can warm the frostbitten area and make the blood flow smoothly. And among the many radio waves contained in ultra-shortwave, there is a type of thunder wave that can warm the human body evenly.

In cases of negligence, the frostbitten area may become inflamed due to swelling. This swelling is very harmful because it can hinder blood circulation, which means that the limbs stop receiving nutrients. Ultra-shortwave has a powerful anti-swelling effect, causing these swellings to dissipate quickly under the action of radio waves.

It is very dangerous for frostbite to become moist gangrene, and it must be turned into a dry state. In experiments long ago, it was noticed that cold cellular tissue under ultra-shortwave would dry up and shrink into mummies. Soviet scientists applied this drying effect to make wet gangrene form a dry state.

Research in Leningrad the year before last pointed out that ultra-shortwave can drastically increase blood flow in the limbs and quickly heal vasoconstriction, thereby restoring the normal state of nutrient absorption in the limbs.

During the snowstorm-filled Soviet-Finnish War, many soldiers suffered from frostbite. At that time, the Soviet Union provided ultra-shortwave treatment at the front lines. If it were not for this method, countless people would have lost their precious lives as a result of frostbite.

According to the research of the Federal Institute of Experimental Medicine, the Leningrad Institute of Industrial Medicine unprecedentedly manufactured a large number of mobile ultra-shortwave therapy devices and transported them to the front lines.

And now, the snow-filled winter has descended on the Russian plains. The Soviet-German war is underway, and Hitler's blitzkrieg has completely collapsed. Winter is the biggest headache for the Nazis. The invention and application of this medically novel treatment method is also a guarantee for the Soviet Union's victory!

### A Little Girl's Psychology

— Xu

I am an eighteen-year-old girl, and I am most afraid of hearing the old saying: "When a boy grows up, he should marry, and when a girl grows up, she should marry," because it has taken away many of my young girlfriends. They are about the same age as me, and they have already become young mistresses or future ones, but I have taken advantage of being short; so I have not talked about this marriage issue.

My personality is very special. I like to learn the bearing of men. Therefore, when I participate in performances at the school's游藝會, I always put on a suit and pretend to be someone else's son. I think this is very proud; but after all, I am a girl!

There are only my brother and me in my family, so I am very spoiled. They all call me "Second Official." When I was fifteen or sixteen years old, I had a few friends, and they all removed their nicknames and were respected as "Miss", but I still kept the boy's name "Second Official". All my actions were still the same as when I was twelve or thirteen, carefree, only knowing how to eat, drink, read, play, and not caring about anything else. People were constantly introducing them to marriage (in this Shanghai, which is called civilized, old-fashioned marriage still occupies an important position). They wanted to learn adult accents to avoid being badmouthed by others, but I played carefree, how happy!

But it's not right. Recently, people have also changed their tune and called me "Miss." I became a little anxious. My carefree gentleman is a bit unsafe. My mother tells me every day to learn well so that I won't give her problems in the future. I began to suspect, must a girl marry when she grows up? I thought that my age was not that old, so I couldn't talk about this issue! I now pray every day that this unfortunate news will not enter my little heart so quickly, because I feel that I am still young, my studies have not been completed, and my career has not been done, how can I start a family? I don't want to waste my youth on building a home. I don't want to be burdened by my husband and children. I want to be a free person, a happy person. Let me talk about these things when I need them! Let me live a few more years as a little bird in my parents' arms.

### Faint Gesture

— Lu Jing

Regarding life and death, a Western ancient writer once said, "Life is like a game of chess; each person is like a chess piece, each with its own position, but when the game is over, all the pieces are mixed together and stored in a bag. It is just like people ultimately returning to the grave."

Good! Even if life is like a game of chess! Yet before the game is over, we should at least strive to be a chess piece that is not oppressed by other chess pieces!

But we are chess pieces oppressed by other chess pieces.

Now I want to talk about an extremely ordinary thing.

This matter is so ordinary that those who are sentimental will feel the taste of this incident without my mentioning it. Therefore, I don't want to dwell on this matter.

However, I cannot help but talk about this little hand, which I have seen and often see before my eyes...

When that person knocked the vegetable-selling woman without a hawker's license to the ground, raining blows and kicks upon her, the woman had a child in swaddling clothes on her back, a child about two years old!

That child (about two years old) actually felt the pain his mother was suffering! Reaching out a small hand from the swaddling clothes, he gestured to the Sikh policeman, begging him not to hit his mother anymore. The gesture was innate, extremely pleading and earnest. If "human love" were not exclusively latent in the hearts of infants, it would revive a dead heart.

However, the child was finally taken away by others because his mother's head was finally pierced by that person, spurting blood, and she fainted!

Here, there, are there many more such small hands? No matter how touching the pleading gesture is, darkness is in the world, and people cannot see it, I know. (Remuneration for helping with student aid funds)

### Polishing Airplanes

— Yong Yun

Shoe-shining has become a popular business on the streets of Shanghai, but airplane-polishing seems unheard of. The purpose of polishing airplanes and polishing shoes is initially the same: both are for aesthetic beauty. American commercial airplanes, after passing government tests, must be polished to a shine on the day they officially carry passengers to attract customers. The method of polishing airplanes is similar to that of polishing shoes, except that the polishing cloth is longer and larger, and there are more people doing the polishing.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fifteen. Dad, let's go busking!

The first person to visit Begonia in his small lodging after he was injured was truly someone he could not have imagined.

"Dad, there's a Mr. Zhang from the troupe here to see you!" Just as Begonia was closing his eyes and groaning on the couch, Mei Bao gently approached, lifted half of the curtain, and announced to him.

After a long while, Begonia reluctantly raised his eyelids and looked behind Mei Bao.

"Ah...!" He was startled at the sight of Zhang Yincai.

Although Zhang Yincai was only a martial arts performer in the Red Stage troupe, he was particularly gifted with courage and aggression, almost like a mantis; for him, fighting and causing trouble were as common as spitting and farting. Over the years, relying on his own two fists and a few brainless apprentices, he had established a deep foundation in the Marius area. None of the big shots in the Red Stage troupe, from the backstage manager to the literary and martial arts supervisors, were in his eyes. Therefore, when Begonia saw him, he felt that his arrival was even more abrupt than the backstage manager's visit, and he was extremely apprehensive.

"Old Wu, don't bother, just lie down and rest!" Begonia almost struggled to get up, but Zhang Yincai reached out a large hand to press him down forcefully. (273)

### China's Shakespeare — Tang Xianzu

— Xiao Gong

There is a rising star writer in the Chinese literary scene, Zhao Jingshen, who is currently a professor at Fudan University. Because of his excellent and innovative teaching methods, he has won unanimous praise from students. I remember when I was studying at a certain high school, I had the privilege of receiving his guidance for half a year. The impression he gave me was: a kind and amiable gentleman. He was unconstrained in class, and the teacher and students were like friends. When excited, he would sing ballad singing, drum singing, Kunqu Opera, etc., and he could also speak various dialects, making the students listen with relish and forget the time. This is what Professor Zhao is good at, and it is also his special style.——Having said so much "idle talk," let's get back to the topic.

It is said that on the afternoon of the 13th of this month, the French Association of Aurora University specially invited Professor Zhao to the school to give a lecture entitled "China's Shakespeare — Tang Xianzu." This is a very interesting topic. Professor Zhao, with his fluent eloquence, humorous tone, and composed demeanor, spoke eloquently, moving all who listened. Here, a brief account of his lecture is given below:

The reason why China's Tang Xianzu and England's great writer Shakespeare are compared is because their birth and death periods are similar, with Tang being on average fifteen years older than Shakespeare. Moreover, their styles of creating dramas are also somewhat similar. Of course, in terms of reputation, Shakespeare is world-renowned, while China's Tang Xianzu is only known to the Chinese, and even then, only to a part of the Chinese.

Tang Xianzu has five works in his lifetime, namely The Peony Pavilion, The Story of Nanke, The Purple Hairpin, The Story of Handan, and The Purple Xiao. The first four are passed down to later generations, and not long ago they could often be heard in the Kunqu Opera troupe of the Eastern Bookstore. Among them, "The Peony Pavilion" is a tragedy, and it is said that women especially love to watch this drama. The story of The Peony Pavilion depicts the romance between Huo Xiaoyu and Li Yi, a man and a woman. Originally, the ending of this play was very tragic, but the author Tang Xianzu, in order to avoid making future generations sad when reading it, changed its ending to a "reunion" tragedy. In fact, the true tragedy should end with the separation or death of the characters, and it should not be given a "reunion" ending; turning a tragedy into a "comedy" ending is really undesirable and contrary to the principles of drama.

Tang's four works are also known as the "Four Dreams." The plot of The Peony Pavilion is moving and touching, and it is indeed a rare work. It is a pity that Tang's personality is stubborn, arrogant, and self-important, which is his greatest shortcoming.

When Professor Zhao narrated the story of The Peony Pavilion, he sang two Kunqu opera excerpts in the middle. But I am an outsider, and I am ashamed to be unable to appreciate the meaning of the lyrics. If it were not for his detailed explanation after the singing, I would have been really confused.

### "Shí Yīn" Concert

— Ya Er

To be held at the YMCA tomorrow night

In the last two months, there have been a great number of music concerts. The Shí Yīn Music Society has also decided to hold its 14th concert tomorrow night (the 28th) at 8 o'clock at the YMCA on Ba Xian Qiao. The program for this concert consists mostly of chorus pieces, especially old Russian and Soviet opera pieces. In order to adjust the entire performance, "Shí Yīn" has also invited several solo musicians to participate in the collaboration, most notably Mr. Zhang Hao's two solo songs and Mrs. Kempf's two solo performances. The warm feeling that "Shí Yīn" gives to people at each concert has almost become "common sense." Here, we respectfully recommend it to people who feel the cold of winter.

— Xing

Chen Yunshang returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday. This trip lasted a month, and in Hong Kong, she completed the film "Female Robin Hood," fulfilling an old contract signed last year. Chen's appearance is the same as before, her skin color is only slightly darker.

Also: Recently, one or two film publications have implicated Chen Yunshang in the case of Xu Daquan, the pharmacist of Hua Mei Pharmacy, who murdered his brother. Those who do not know the details are half-believing and half-doubting. In fact, the Chen Yunshang involved in the Xu Daquan fratricide case is another person, rumored to be a dancer, or, according to one account, a hostess.

Chapter 19: Dusk, Nomad Cavalry, Dust Covering the City

So the two of them had their subordinates eat their fill in the evening, and then set off with muffled hooves. Fortunately, it was a dark and moonless night, and the bandits on the opposite bank would hardly notice them. They marched quickly for more than twenty li and soon arrived at Miao Family Village. The river channel there was narrow and shallow, making it an ideal place to cross troops by stealth. Looking at the dark and silent opposite bank, without a single light, there were probably no bandits stationed there. Xu Jing then instructed his subordinates to wake up the villagers, persuaded them kindly, and borrowed a dozen small boats to build a temporary pontoon bridge and cross over in batches. Liu Yinying led the way in front, and Xu Jing followed behind. After about an hour, all the soldiers had safely crossed the Ao River. Sure enough, without anyone knowing, the bandits stationed in the two camps on the riverbank were still asleep. Liu Yinying mounted his warhorse, led the soldiers, and hurried towards the bandit's camp. After walking for about ten li, they soon saw the lights ahead. The bandit's camp was in sight. So Liu Yinying ordered the horns to be blown and the torches to be lit, and they charged forward together. The bandits were caught off guard by the sudden attack of a Ming army from their side, and they were panicked and frightened. Liu Yinying raised his spear and leaped on his horse, charging to the front of the bandit camp. The bandit general Yu Huoxing spurred his horse, brandishing his saber, and went forward to meet him. Before they could exchange a blow, Yu Huoxing's throat was pierced by Liu Yinying's spear, red rain splattered everywhere, and he fell under his horse. The bandit crowd was in chaos. Liu Yinying charged into the camp, and everyone who was hit by his spear fell to the ground. He then set fire to the camp. He kicked down several camps in succession, setting fire to each. Li Yan, in the darkness, did not know how many Ming soldiers had come. He also had to defend against the Ming army on the opposite bank of the Luan River on the front, so he was caught off guard and hurriedly ordered all his subordinates to fire crossbow arrows. (229)
