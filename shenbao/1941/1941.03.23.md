### U.S. House of Representatives Unanimously Passes a Huge National Defense Supplementary Appropriation; Continental Army Plan to be Swiftly Realized; Lend-Lease Appropriation Bill to be Debated in the Senate Tomorrow

Washington - The House of Representatives yesterday unanimously passed a $4,073,000,000 fifth national defense supplementary appropriation bill and has sent the bill to the Senate for discussion. The House, after four hours of debate, passed the bill by a vote of 320 to 0. The most important point raised during the debate was New York Republican Representative Fish's warning. Fish stated that if the current program of excessive spending in the United States continues, the entire American economic and financial system will collapse and be replaced by a new order of national socialism. Fish predicted that by the end of June, total U.S. expenditures under the Lend-Lease Act would exceed $40,000,000,000. He also predicted that another tax bill would be passed in the coming months to raise a huge sum of between $20,000,000,000 and $30,000,000,000 to increase revenue. American businesses, large and small, will be paralyzed by the burden of this tax. This bill was immediately sent to the House for discussion after being passed by the House Appropriations Committee. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Washington - The House Appropriations Committee yesterday approved the $40,000,000,000 fifth supplementary national defense appropriation bill. The House will soon begin debating the bill. The testimony of Army Chief of Staff General Marshall before the committee in a closed session on March 5 was released yesterday. He said that the United States received detailed reference materials regarding German mechanized divisions at the end of February. The U.S. Army is preparing to establish eight such mechanized divisions. The War Department currently has two divisions, and the War Department plans to allocate $1,880,000,000 to establish new Atlantic air force bases. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Washington - The military output from factories stipulated in the U.S. budget is sufficient to supply the needs of four million soldiers. The proposal to continue adding funding to the Army and Navy, exceeding $4,073,000,000, has now been sent to the House. At the same time, the Senate Appropriations Committee passed the original text of the $7,000,000,000 aid-to-Britain bill without any modifications. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### U.S. Has Drafted Production Plan; Will Supply Britain with 20,000 Aircraft in the Next 18 Months

New York - According to a dispatch from Washington, senior U.S. government officials have drafted a production plan to supply Britain with 20,000 military aircraft in the next 18 months, including the 10,700 aircraft stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act (approximately half of which are medium and heavy bombers) and the 9,000 aircraft ordered by Britain before the passage of this bill. Responsible parties have announced that they are currently "investigating air routes to Britain" to allow night-flying fighter planes to fly in segments. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Stipulating $10,000,000,000 for Constructing a Powerful Air Force

Washington - The U.S. plan to build a powerful air force and an army of four million men has taken a step closer to realization with the unanimous passage of the fifth national defense supplementary appropriation bill by the House of Representatives yesterday. The passage of this huge appropriation bill is of great importance to the Army Department's plans, as the largest amount listed in the bill, totaling $10,000,000,000, is for the immediate construction of 3,600 Army bombers (including 1,200 four-engine heavy bombers). A portion of this amount is also for equipping the primary and secondary equipment used by four million soldiers. Some individuals have criticized the use of such a large sum of money for national defense. Virginia Democratic Representative Woodrum said that the total cost of U.S. defense now exceeds $25,000,000,000, not including the $7,000,000,000 Lend-Lease appropriation passed by the House. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Washington - The Senate is scheduled to begin debating the $7,000,000,000 Lend-Lease appropriation bill on the 24th. According to leaders of the Democratic Party in the Senate, the opposition has completely collapsed, and the bill will be passed quickly. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

to reach British shores. As for our fleet visiting Australia, it is also a symbol of our concern for the current situation. The Hartford Courant reported that we are already practically participating in the war. Our country is the arsenal of the democratic countries, and its important position in the war is no less than that of soldiers fighting on the battlefield. The Dallas Morning News reported that if anyone still has doubts about our country's assistance to democratic countries in the war, they should read President Roosevelt's speech and be reassured.

### U.S. May Reassign High Commissioner to the Philippines

Washington - Secretary of the Interior Ickes is currently accompanying President Roosevelt on a ten-day fishing trip. It is heard that he is definitely discussing the position of the High Commissioner to the Philippines with the President. There is nothing to indicate that the current High Commissioner Sayre will be recalled home. Reliable sources say that the authorities intend to appoint Sayre as an advisor on post-war international transportation affairs. There are many contenders for the vacated position, the most important being former Minister to Canada Cromwell, followed by former Commander of the Asiatic Fleet Yarnell, and then former Ambassador to Britain Kennedy. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

### Personnel Changes in the Soviet Navy

Moscow - Admiral Isakov, Deputy People's Commissar for the Navy of the Soviet Union, has been appointed concurrently as Chief of Staff of the Navy.

U.S. to Ship Military Supplies to Britain; May Dispatch Warships as Escort

Washington - U.S. Navy officials expressed in private conversations here last night that the United States will soon escort its military supplies across the Atlantic to Britain. Reuters heard from a certain source that this may be seen in a few days. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Washington - Senior shipping officials said yesterday that fifty U.S. merchant ships could be transferred to Britain within days, 75% of which are old ships from the First World War that have been re-equipped and are past their prime. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

New York - A New York Times correspondent in Washington reported that the issue of convoys is currently under discussion. Some outspoken officials have long seen the need for convoys to ensure that U.S. promises do not become empty talk. They have since made their views more noticeable. However, as escorting with U.S. fleets would increase the possibility of a German declaration of war, President Roosevelt and his experts and advisors must carefully consider this step. The news that the U.S. will transfer fifty merchant ships to the U.S. side was widely praised by various radio critics last night. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Washington - It is heard that the U.S. government has collected 150 small warships in various ports, preparing to hand them over to the British Navy for escorting merchant ships. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

New York - President Roosevelt's recent speech on aiding the various democratic countries is still being enthusiastically praised by newspapers across the country. The New York Times reported that the victory of the democratic countries is linked to the fortune of the U.S., a fact that no one can now ignore. Although the President's speech only expressed his personal views, in reality, he has expressed the views of the entire American nation. The attitude of the American nation has now been fully revealed. In short, our policy of aiding the various democratic countries is backed by 130 million people and unlimited natural resources. Our country's massive industry is only in the early stages of wartime production. With our earnest desire, we believe that the various supplies we ship across the ocean will surely be like

### Exchange Stabilization Fund Issue; China and Britain in Negotiations; To Avoid Use to Support Shanghai Black Market; Some British Parties Propose Payment Agreement

London - It is believed here that the recent weakness of Chinese legal tender is due to the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund not supporting the black market, not because the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund is unable to do so, but because it is unwilling to do so. The Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund certainly has a large amount of cash as a result of the U.S. loan. Negotiations are currently underway between China and Britain to ensure that British gold assistance to the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund is not used to support the Shanghai black market. The above-mentioned black market is a major loophole in British gold exchange controls. Some parties propose the establishment of a China-Britain payment agreement, using special accounting. However, given the international complexity of the Shanghai foreign exchange market, greater flexibility is given to Chinese holders of British gold than elsewhere. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Japanese Invasion of China Has Greatly Damaged Its Vitality

Stockholm, Sweden - The Swedish Gothenburg Daily newspaper stated in its editorial today that while there is no reason to underestimate Japan's war machine, the prolonged and inconclusive war in China has greatly damaged Japan's vitality. Japan's grand plans of conquest have not been realized. If Japan engages in war with a powerful country in the Pacific, it will put Japan in a worse situation than Italy. Matsuoka's propaganda and intense anti-American agitation are clearly linked. Berlin has openly hoped that the U.S. will participate in the war in a more definite way. The reason for this hope is not to have one more enemy, but because the U.S.'s assistance as a non-belligerent is a greater threat to Germany than if the U.S. were to participate in the war. If Berlin can induce Japan to believe that the U.S. is attacking Germany, then the Three-Power Pact will be put into effect. This means that Japan, Slovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria must provide military assistance to the Axis powers. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Editorial

### After Yugoslavia Joins the Axis

At the beginning of this month, after Bulgaria joined the Axis and German troops poured into Bulgarian territory, the world knew that before formally attacking Greece, Hitler would first pressure Yugoslavia to allow German troops to pass through, following in the footsteps of Bulgaria. The goal of the psychological warfare that Germany has been waging against the Belgrade government for the past three weeks is none other than this. According to a news report yesterday, after a long period of debate, the Yugoslav cabinet has decided to sign an agreement with Germany, Italy, and Japan; to join the alliance, but to refuse to accept any military obligations, only allowing German ambulances and armaments to pass through, but not troops. If this approach can win Hitler's approval, then although it is a surrender, it can also be seen as a small achievement for the efforts of Yugoslav officials and people in recent months to maintain independence and integrity and prepare to shed blood to defend themselves; because the degree of their surrender is indeed better than that of Romania and Bulgaria. In addition, the anger and excitement of some of the people and the departure of three cabinet members when the Yugoslav cabinet made its decision are at least enough to show that the hearts of the Yugoslavs are not dead; if Hitler still wants to make further demands, it is difficult to guarantee that other issues will not arise.

Originally, since Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria successively surrendered, Yugoslavia had become a fish on the chopping block that Hitler was eager to seize; and the invisible disintegration of the Balkan Entente had left her completely isolated. In terms of military strategy, she was almost surrounded by the Axis powers on all sides, although she had hundreds of thousands of troops that were still capable of fighting, but due to the complexity of her ethnic groups, domestic opinions were not necessarily completely consistent. In terms of diplomacy, Britain had the heart to protect her, but was powerless to do so; the Soviet Union was certainly very concerned, but had absolutely no ability to help. Under these circumstances, it was simply expected that Yugoslavia would eventually succumb. From now on, assuming that there are no major changes in Yugoslavia's turbulent regime, and no major fluctuations occur abroad that are sufficient to change the current situation in the Balkans, then the fate of this "eighth allied country" will inevitably become a vassal of Germany; even if it is not militarily occupied by German troops, it will at least be completely controlled by the Nazis economically and politically. This tragic fate of disguised destruction has already been repeated, and is commonplace, and the world is deeply sympathetic to it, but what we want to pay more attention to is the future developments after Yugoslavia joins the alliance.

Assuming that Hitler really uses the military convenience he has obtained in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to move his troops south to capture Thessaloniki, and then expand the war towards the southern end of the Balkans and even the Near East, then the subsequent issues seem to be divided into two aspects: first, we must ask whether Greece will remain true to its original intention, not afraid of Germany's powerful military threat, and determined to continue the war? Regarding this level, we believe that there is no doubt, especially today, when British troops have already landed in Greece and U.S. aid has already been implemented, Greece has no reason to give up halfway and fail to achieve success. Moreover, Hitler has truly prepared to create a new battlefield in the southern end of the Balkans to consume the troops he plans to use for an attack on Britain, and it has not yet been completely determined. Second, we must see how Turkey and the Soviet Union react? According to a Havas dispatch the other day, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu flew to the British island of Cyprus recently to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden. Before the meeting, Saracoglu had repeatedly exchanged views with the Soviet government and obtained some "guarantees" from the Soviet Union; it can be seen that this meeting between the British and Turkish foreign ministers is not only related to the decision of Turkey's attitude, but also enough to reveal the true intentions of Moscow. Unfortunately, as of now, Britain, Turkey, and the Soviet Union have completely kept silent about this level. One view is that the Soviet Union advised Yugoslavia to join the Three-Power Alliance, but opposed allowing German troops to pass through, and another view is that the Soviet Union will sign an agreement similar to the Three-Power Alliance with Yugoslavia to "guarantee" Yugoslavia's territorial integrity; according to the former view, the Soviet Union has almost recognized that Germany's pressure on Yugoslavia is irresistible in fact, so it has to advise the Yugoslav authorities to make limited concessions; according to the latter view, the Soviet Union clearly wants to use the same method to offset Germany's pressure on Yugoslavia, so that Yugoslavia becomes a "non-aggression buffer zone." Regardless of which view is correct, at least we can find a clue from this; that is, the Soviet Union is not prepared to take active intervention actions in the Balkans for the time being, but still hopes to avoid the expansion of the war in this area as much as possible. Therefore, if Hitler "remains inactive," and only uses military superiority to force Greece to negotiate peace alone, then the current attitude of the Soviet Union and even Turkey may continue for some time. Conversely, if German troops immediately expand the war, even affecting the safety of Turkey's straits, then there will inevitably be other surprising developments in the Balkans in the future; how these divergent paths of movement will eventually converge will be seen in the unfolding of the Nazi's so-called spring offensive.

### Chinese Army in Jiangxi Begins Counter-Offensive Against Japanese Army; Japanese Casualties Over Past Five Days Number Three Thousand; Chinese Army in Suiyuan Repeatedly Captures Important Strongholds

Chongqing - A Ta Kung Pao reporter in Changsha reported today that the Chinese army has begun a counter-offensive against the Japanese army in Jiangxi. In the past five days, Japanese casualties numbered 2,000 to 3,000, and the trend has shifted in favor of the Chinese army. The newspaper prominently reported the Japanese army's offensive in Tingxi today. This time, the Japanese army advanced westward along the Nanchang-Changsha highway. The main column of the Japanese army supported other troops. The right wing of the Japanese army has reached Shangfu, 50 miles west of Nanchang, and near Shanggao, 77 miles west of Nanchang, but Shanggao was still in the hands of the Chinese army yesterday. There is still fierce fighting in northwestern Jiangxi Province. Chinese military sources reported that the Chinese army that recovered Gaochuan withdrew from the area on March 18 and retreated to positions not threatened by the Japanese army. After recovering Gaochuan, the Chinese army continued to advance westward, threatening Wuhu, but the Japanese army launched a fierce counter-offensive. As a result, the Chinese army withdrew from Gaochuan after destroying various fortifications. A Chinese military spokesman denied that the Japanese army had surrounded the Chinese army west of Taihu, because the Japanese army's own transportation lines could not be maintained and were often harassed by guerrillas. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

Lihuang - The Japanese army, which was repulsed by the Chinese army at Wushanpo, reinforced with more than 2,000 troops and more than 10 artillery pieces from Shaniatangshan on the 15th and launched a counter-attack against the Chinese army. The Chinese army fought bravely and intercepted them, killing many Japanese soldiers. (Dispatch, 21st)

### National Government Decides to Continue Construction of Yunnan-Burma Railway; Issues U.S. Dollar Bonds to Fund Construction; U.S. Agrees to Allow Bonds to Circulate in U.S. Market

Chongqing - Newspapers here recently reported that the Chinese government has decided to circulate bonds worth U.S. $100,000,000 in the U.S. market to fund the construction of the Kunming-Lashio railway, and stated that the U.S. government has agreed to this plan. The plan to circulate Chinese bonds in the U.S. market was proposed by Dr. Cooley, an administrative assistant to President Roosevelt, who recently returned from a visit to China. If this plan is successful, the Kunming-Lashio railway will become a joint undertaking of China, Britain, and the U.S. Newspapers also stated that the government has ordered Kwong Bing-shun, a representative of overseas Chinese in San Francisco, to handle the circulation of bonds in the U.S. Kwong left for Hong Kong last night and will transfer to the U.S. The Chinese bonds here will be circulated in the U.S. market, and the funds raised will be used to purchase U.S. railway materials for the construction of the Kunming-Lashio railway. The section of the railway in British territory from Lashio to the border will also be built with the above-mentioned U.S. materials, as it is currently difficult to transport British materials to China. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Chongqing - The Chinese government has decided to issue U.S. dollar bonds worth U.S. $80,000,000 to build the Yunnan-Burma railway. It has now obtained special permission from the U.S. government to issue them in the U.S. Once the legislative procedures here are completed, they can be issued. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Chongqing - The National Government has firmly decided to continue the construction of the Yunnan-Burma railway. It is also heard that the required funds will be raised by issuing gold bonds. Because there is a special agreement with the U.S. government, it is rumored that Washington has agreed to allow China to raise U.S. $10,000,000 in the U.S. This road was originally started by the Chinese government, but was later suspended due to circumstances. When the Burmese delegation came to Chongqing two months ago, the Chinese and Burmese representatives discussed this issue. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### British Businesses Adopt Shanghai Time in Beiping

Beiping - It was recently announced that nine British businesses and the Foreign Banks Association will adopt Shanghai time starting Monday. However, the official time of the embassy district in Dongjiaominxiang will not change. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Wartime Public Bond Solicitation Committee Stipulates Bond Solicitation Methods

Chongqing - The Wartime Public Bond Solicitation Committee has received instructions from Chairman Chiang on bond solicitation methods, using both solicitation and allocation. In cities, fair allocation is the principle, and in rural areas, solicitation and subscription are the principle. Therefore, a deliberation committee will be established in Chongqing, inviting relevant authorities and locals familiar with the local situation to serve as committee members, so as to implement fair allocation. The establishment of this committee is due to the suggestion of Kwong Bing-shun, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman from the Americas. The overseas Chinese in the Americas have an assessment committee that assesses the wealth and income of overseas Chinese donors each time to determine the amount of their contributions. Kwong will fly to Hong Kong today to return to the U.S. to serve as the resident commissioner of the solicitation committee in the U.S. The government has also designated Kwong Bing-shun to preside over the solicitation work. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### Soviet Union and Japan Purchase Large Quantities of Philippine Coconut Oil

Manila - Authoritative sources say that the quantity of coconut oil and copra shipped from the Philippines to Vladivostok, Shanghai, and Kobe has recently increased significantly. Many believe that these items must be transshipped to Germany. Authoritative sources point out that most of these items are shipped to the Soviet Union, which is clearly shipped to Germany, because the Soviet Union did not need such a quantity of goods before the war and has no coconut oil refining equipment. In February, a total of 15,000 tons of copra were shipped out of Manila, and the quantity of coconut oil and copra that should be shipped out this month is likely to be the same. The first Soviet ship to Manila loaded 5,800 tons of copra and left after a week. The shipping industry expects that five Soviet ships will come here within three months. Negotiations on purchasing more copra and coconut oil have begun in Moscow. Chinese exporters here are planning or have already shipped 30,000 tons of these items to Shanghai, which will be shipped to Shanghai and transshipped to the Soviet Union in the next three months. These exporters also say that Shanghai exporters used to purchase copra from the Dutch East Indies, but the Dutch there have refused to export it because they believe that these items will be transshipped to Germany. Therefore, Manila has become the only market for purchasing this item, even if the price is 40% higher than in the Dutch East Indies, trade is still booming. Japan's purchase of this item has increased significantly, with Mitsui & Co. purchasing the most. It is heard that what the Japanese purchase is also transshipped elsewhere. The price increase of these items is due to the large purchases in Kobe and Shanghai. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

### US Military Experts Predict: Balkan War Will Erupt; British Success or Failure Hinges on Maintaining Control of the Near East; Germany Will Not Dare Invade Britain Until Victorious in the Balkans

Washington – American military experts recently have been focusing their attention on the Balkan front, believing that the eruption of a Balkan war is almost certain to be decisive, similar to the situation in 1918. These prophetic experts say that if Hitler can break through the combined British and Greek defenses on the Bulgarian front, the Germans' prospects will be greater than any gains they have made anywhere since the war began. At that time, the Germans' opportunity will be even better than when France surrendered and Britain was heavily bombed last September. Britain's international prestige and military fate largely depend on whether Britain can maintain the Suez Canal, as the Suez Canal is the most important condition for defending the British Empire, more important than Gibraltar or any other location. Military experts also explained that Britain's ability to maintain supply lines connecting South Africa and Australia depends entirely on its ability to control the Red Sea. If Britain is forced to abandon the Red Sea, it will lose its connection to the rich grain-producing areas of the Nile region, the oil fields of the Near East, and if the Allies can further control French Africa, the route around the Cape of Good Hope will also be in danger. In short, many things will depend on whether Britain can permanently control the Suez Canal and the eastern Mediterranean. If this gateway can remain open, Hitler may not dare to launch an attack on Gibraltar, because the western end of the Mediterranean is far less important than the eastern end. This is why Britain is greatly reinforcing Greece; otherwise, Britain could have used this large army to annihilate the Italians in Libya at this time. Germany's large army in the same region, even at the expense of Italy's prestige (Italy must rely on German aid to attack Greece, and its prestige will naturally be damaged), is also for this reason. Military experts also believe that Germany will probably not attempt any invasion of Britain until the Balkan war reaches a decisive stage. (United Press report, 22nd)

### German Navy Launches Blitzkrieg Against Britain; 20,000-Ton Ships Appear in the Atlantic; Germany Claims British Ships Suffered Heavy Losses

London – A Reuters naval reporter said that according to London officials, the German 26,000-ton battlecruisers "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" have recently escaped into the Atlantic. British Prime Minister Churchill, in his speech on Monday, disclosed that two German battlecruisers engaged in attacks were operating westward in the Atlantic, reaching as far as the 42nd meridian, a location two-thirds of the way from Britain to North America. According to information received a few days ago, it has been confirmed that these two ships are the "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau." Germany's risking these two ships to engage in Atlantic warfare shows that Hitler's navy is now fully mobilized, launching a "shipping lane blitzkrieg" in the Atlantic, hoping to cut off American supplies to Britain. These two ships began construction in 1934 and were completed in 1939 and 1938, respectively, with a speed of 27 knots. However, the speed during sea trials was considered higher than this, so it is believed that their actual speed exceeds 29 knots. If fuel is conserved, they can stay at sea for about three weeks without refueling. The two ships are sister ships, and their main armament is nine 11-inch guns. The "Scharnhorst" was hit by the British battleship "Glorious" off the coast of Norway last April, and was later hit by a torpedo fired by the British submarine "Clyde," suffering heavy damage. It was also bombed by the British Air Force in Kiel. (Reuters report, 22nd)

Berlin – This afternoon, the German military communique stated that Admiral Lütjens, commander of the German medium-sized fleet operating in the Atlantic, reported that his fleet had sunk 22 enemy merchant ships (116,000 tons). A group of enemy ships, fully loaded with goods from West Africa, was sailing to England. Although British ships escorted them along the way, German submarines repeatedly attacked them for several days. After several attacks, a total of 11 enemy ships were sunk (77,000 tons). Yesterday, German aircraft also posed a significant threat to enemy ships, destroying 31,000 tons of enemy ships and sinking 6,000 tons of enemy ships. North of Crete, a new oil tanker (12,000 tons) was hit and caught fire. Two other ships were also hit, one ruptured and one caught fire. Near Malta, a British destroyer was hit. In the Bristol Channel, a merchant ship (4,000 tons) and a mobile oil tanker (4,000 tons) were sunk. Another merchant ship was sunk in Aldeburgh. (Haitong Electric report, 22nd)

Berlin – As the German spring offensive moves forward, the German side claimed last night that the British ships destroyed in the past 24 hours amounted to at least 95,000 tons or 101,000 tons. The German High Command stated that Nazi submarines and dive bombers attacked two large British convoys, one in the Atlantic off the coast of West Africa and the other in the Mediterranean near Crete. It is claimed that as a result of the attacks, at least 87,000 tons of ships fully loaded with goods and even larger British fleets were attacked and sunk. It is said that all ships sunk by torpedoes were fully loaded with valuable goods heading to England. (International News Agency report, 22nd)

London – The Atlantic submarine base in Lorient, on the west coast of France, was attacked by British aircraft for the third consecutive night last night. It is reported that the latest British-style super bombers participated in the air raid, dropping extremely heavy bombs. Although details have not been released, it is believed to have been very successful. (Reuters report, 22nd)

### US Air Force’s Powerful Weapon: 82-Ton Heavy Bomber to Test Atlantic Crossing

New York – The world's largest and most powerful bomber will soon make a test flight across the Atlantic. This aircraft is the 82-ton Douglas B-19, capable of flying across the Atlantic, dropping 18 tons of high-explosive bombs, and then flying back to its base. Mr. Altick described the details of this flight weapon in New York, saying that it is not only the largest military aircraft ever built, but also equipped with large-caliber machine guns and electrically powered, rapid-firing cannons, in addition to carrying bombs. This aircraft can exert its power above the range of anti-aircraft shells. The aircraft can accommodate a crew of ten, but if used to transport troops, it can carry 125 armed soldiers. The landing gear of this aircraft weighs five tons. (Reuters report, 22nd)

### Political Turmoil in Yugoslavia; German-Yugoslav Negotiations Stall; Three Yugoslav Cabinet Members Strive Against Signing Submissive Agreement with Germany by Threatening to Resign

Capital of Yugoslavia – According to local political observers, a serious change may occur in the Yugoslav political situation at any time. Regent Prince Paul recently met with Serbian Orthodox elders to discuss countermeasures, but the details are unknown. (Havas Agency report, 21st)

Capital of Yugoslavia – A new political crisis has erupted in Yugoslavia. The so-called compromise conditions of the German side have caused a split in the Yugoslav cabinet. This was discovered after the cabinet met twice in 24 hours. Regent Prince Paul met with Prime Minister Cvetković and Deputy Prime Minister Maček on Friday afternoon to consider the next steps. Two cabinet members have already resigned, and another is preparing to resign, all in opposition to accepting the German proposal. It is reported that the latest proposal from the German side is to compromise between the demands of the Axis powers and those of Yugoslavia, superficially stipulating that foreign troops will not be stationed in Yugoslavia, but in practice granting Germany extensive transportation rights, such as the passage of military supplies through Yugoslavia. The German proposal also includes a clause prohibiting all anti-Axis movements. In return, the signatory countries of the Axis powers can guarantee the integrity of Yugoslavia. Nine cabinet members advocate accepting it, including Croatian Peasant Party leader Maček, Foreign Minister Marković, and three Croatian and three Serbian party members, as well as one Slovene party member. The Prime Minister and the leaders of the other three parties, including the Muslim leader, are hesitant. The cabinet members who have already resigned are Minister of Agriculture Mihailović, Minister of Justice Trnski and Minister of Social Welfare Budisavljević. Minister of Supplies Protić is also preparing to resign if the German conditions are accepted. Since the Yugoslav cabinet is showing signs of breaking down after much debate, the issue has been transferred to the Regent for handling. Prime Minister Cvetković and Deputy Prime Minister Maček have had lengthy discussions with Prince Paul in the palace. It is reported that during the talks, Prince Paul summoned the leader of the Slovenian People's Party, Krek, to the palace for consultation. According to the latest news, the Minister of the Army did not participate in the cabinet meeting. Those opposition party leaders who did not participate in the cabinet meeting unanimously opposed accepting the German conditions, believing that accepting such conditions would be tantamount to surrendering to Germany.

### Rumor of Continued German Pressure on Yugoslavia

London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that according to responsible sources here, although the news coming from Yugoslavia is still confused and unclear, it is certain that Germany is continuing to pressure Yugoslavia to conclude an agreement with it so that it can join the Axis powers. Today, a New York American news agency reported that former Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović, known for being pro-German, has been detained by the British. The news agency believes that the Yugoslav authorities handed Mr. Stojadinović over to the British to prevent any pro-German conspiracies from occurring in the Yugoslav capital during the crucial negotiations. According to news from the Yugoslav capital, negotiations with Germany have been temporarily suspended due to the tense situation in the capital. Currently, the Yugoslav government has not commented on rumors that Germany has put forward a compromise counter-proposal, but most news from the Yugoslav capital indicates that Yugoslavia will prevent foreign troops from entering Yugoslav territory, even if they are only passing through. Regarding the cabinet turmoil, no detailed news has been transmitted from the Yugoslav capital. The government's silence has undoubtedly caused considerable psychological confusion among the Yugoslav people. Yugoslavia's unwillingness to follow in the footsteps of Romania and Bulgaria has been clearly expressed. The disagreement within the cabinet reflects the strong sentiment against signing any agreement with Germany and Italy. If the Yugoslav people discover that their government advocates joining the Axis powers, it will undoubtedly arouse public anger. According to news here, the British ambassador to Yugoslavia has met with Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul in recent days. (Reuters report, 22nd)

### Soviet Diplomacy Secretly Active

Capital of Yugoslavia – It has been learned that once Yugoslavia signs the Tripartite Pact, the Soviet Union will also sign a similar agreement with it to guarantee Yugoslavia's territorial integrity. In recent days, Soviet diplomacy towards Yugoslavia has been extremely active. Soviet Ambassador to Bulgaria Lavrentiev also came here yesterday and held lengthy talks with Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković. It is reported that the ambassador advised Yugoslavia to sign the Tripartite Pact in the name of the Soviet government, but stated that the Soviet Union would not be pleased if German troops passed through Yugoslavia. Furthermore, according to a telegram from this newspaper's Berlin correspondent, Soviet Ambassador to Germany Dekanozov has visited German diplomatic authorities several times recently, and it is believed that their discussions must be about the German-Yugoslav issue.

### Turkey Increases National Defense Expenditures

Ankara – The Turkish Parliament has voted to pass a supplementary budget of £30 million Turkish pounds for national defense. The total amount of national defense expenditure for this year has now reached £174,000,000 Turkish pounds, an increase of £100 million Turkish pounds compared to the original budget. (Reuters report, 22nd)

Turkish Capital – According to Turkish political figures, British Foreign Secretary Eden's meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu on Cyprus Island focused on the letters exchanged between Hitler and İsmet İnönü. The newspapers yesterday published a message from the German news agency, announcing that the Turkish ambassador to Germany had delivered İsmet İnönü's reply to Hitler, but the content was not disclosed. According to sources close to the Turkish government, İsmet İnönü's reply was worded with extreme sincerity, reiterating Turkey's desire to maintain friendly relations with Germany.

### Direct Train Service Between the Soviet Union and Hungary

Hungarian Capital – The first direct train between the Soviet Union and Hungary departed from Moscow on the evening of the 20th, and is scheduled to arrive at the East Station of the Hungarian capital at 11:00 tomorrow morning. At that time, it will depart for…

### Pro-German and Pro-British Factions in Opposition

London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that the news circulated by the pro-German faction in Yugoslavia that Germany and Yugoslavia have reached a compromise based on a compromise solution, allowing Germany the right to transport weapons and hospital vehicles through Yugoslavia without restrictions, is, judging from the political phenomena in the Yugoslav capital, at least not yet mature. Observing the trend of the Yugoslav cabinet, the firm attitude of the opposition, and the intense expression of public opinion, Yugoslavia is unlikely to make this important concession. The content of the German proposal is still unknown. According to reliable news from the Yugoslav capital regarding the political situation after the Yugoslav cabinet discussed the German proposal, it can be summarized as follows: the Yugoslav Prime Minister has a neutral attitude towards the German proposal; of the six party leaders who form the government, one supports the German proposal, two oppose it, and three are neutral; the heads of several departments did not participate in the cabinet meeting; the entire opposition party opposes the German conditions. (Reuters report, 22nd)

Istanbul – Yesterday, well-informed diplomatic circles said that, in any case, the talks between the British and Turkish Foreign Ministers on Cyprus Island were very successful with regard to the recent developments in Yugoslavia. Currently, a dispute over foreign policy is taking place in Yugoslavia, with one faction inclining towards the Axis powers and wanting Yugoslavia to join the Tripartite Pact, and the other faction opposing the Axis powers and inclining towards Britain, Greece, and Turkey, wanting to include Yugoslavia in the anti-Axis defense line of the Balkans. (United Press report, 22nd)

### Content of the Agreement Includes Six Items

Capital of Yugoslavia – The cabinet meeting today has decided to sign a resolution with Germany, Italy, and Japan to join the Tripartite Pact. Local political figures recently said that the signing ceremony will be held in Berlin next week, with the intention of waiting for Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke to arrive in Berlin. As for the content of the resolution, it is nothing more than the following clauses:

(1) The signatory countries will guarantee the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. Bulgaria and Hungary will also provide this guarantee as signatory countries. Therefore, Bulgaria and Hungary will abandon their territorial claims against Yugoslavia. (2) The obligations of Yugoslavia are slightly different from those of other signatory countries. Yugoslavia is exempt from all military obligations, such as mutual military assistance and joint participation in military operations.

(3) The signatory countries will allow Yugoslavia's desire to obtain an outlet to the Aegean Sea once the current European war ends and the new European organization is in place to be considered. Currently, Yugoslavia uses the free port of Thessaloniki in Greece. (4) Yugoslavia will allow the weapons and ambulances of other signatory countries to pass through its territory without any inspection and will not prevent the passage of these vehicles. (5) Yugoslavia should suppress all anti-Axis elements within the country. (6) Yugoslavia should make its economic system, allowing its agricultural production, suitable for the needs of Germany. (Havas Electric report, 21st) The Soviet Union's first train also departed. (Haitong News Agency report, 22nd)

### Iraq Declares Policy; Willing to Abide by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty; But Avoids Participating in the War

Baghdad – Iraqi Foreign Minister Suweidi recently made a statement regarding his recent meeting with British Foreign Secretary Eden in Cairo, saying, "We had frank talks in a friendly spirit, which reassured both sides, and a review of the current situation in the Middle East confirmed the need for cooperation between the two Allied countries within the limits of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. I naturally had the opportunity to meet with Eden and exchange views on relations between the two Allied countries, Britain and Iraq. I also contacted other British officials responsible for the Middle East. I can now happily state that these talks have greatly reassured both sides. What Iraq is concerned about is, on the one hand, avoiding the tragedy of war, and on the other hand, fully fulfilling our obligations to the Allied countries." (Reuters report, 22nd)

### German Leader Meets Hungarian Foreign Minister in Munich; Enhancing Cooperation is the Focus of the Talks

Berlin – According to the official gazette, German leader Hitler met with Hungarian Foreign Minister Bárdossy in Munich yesterday, and held talks for over an hour in a spirit of traditional friendship. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. (Haitong News Agency report, 22nd)

Munich – The Hungarian Foreign Minister returned to his country from Munich by special train this morning. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and other dignitaries saw him off at the station. (Haitong Electric report, 22nd)

Munich – The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop gave a welcome speech at the banquet for the Hungarian Foreign Minister, saying, "Since 1918, our two countries have been sincere and trustworthy, with a relationship like brothers. Now, the world's three major powers, namely Germany, Italy, and Japan, have concluded an alliance, and your country took the lead in joining, for which we are deeply grateful. Now, the task undertaken by the Tripartite Alliance has reached its final stage. In other words, the last enemy of the three countries, Britain, is about to fail. The current European war was triggered by Britain's declaration of war on our country on September 3, 1939. How its fate will be decided in 1940 is clear and in our favor. Today, as we engage in the final struggle, we are once again delighted to see our former ally Hungary cooperating with us." The Hungarian Foreign Minister, Bárdossy, immediately replied, emphasizing the close relationship between Germany and Hungary, "I will continue to work hard, following the wishes of the late Foreign Minister Csáky. This is my sacred duty. Our country's foreign policy is based on the Tripartite Alliance, and past trials have all been successful, and we will continue to do so in the future."

### Fighting for the Capture of Corene Fortress; British and Italian Armies Battle in Bloody Conflict; Italy's Last Stronghold in Eastern Libya; Gala-el-Hbeib, the Holy Land, Falls Yesterday

London – The recent communiqué from the British Air Force in the Middle East regarding the heavy bombing of Corene is only part of the relentless offensive by the British army against the strong Italian military stronghold there. According to battle reports, the bloody battle near Corene has lasted for two and a half days and has not stopped. The Italian army has repeatedly launched counterattacks against the positions captured by the British army at the end of the week. Both sides have used all their defensive and offensive weapons, such as heavy artillery bombardment, heavy bombing by large British aircraft, and infantry using hand grenades and bayonet combat. The Italian army also used mortars, and two of them and their artillery were captured. The British Scottish soldiers fought bravely, launching a fierce attack on Corene from the fortresses held by the British, encountering the fiercest counterattack from the Italian Alpine soldiers. The Scottish soldiers engaged in melee combat and repelled the Italian soldiers. A British Highland regiment climbed the hillside and advanced to within two miles of the outer car fortress road of Corene. On the right, Italian soldiers were stationed on both sides of the fortress road. British transportation and supply operations are proceeding smoothly, with mules being used extensively and water being transported continuously. Prisoners are constantly being sent to British military headquarters. According to a communiqué from the British military headquarters in Cairo, the Italian army in Corene, Eritrea, again attempted to counterattack unsuccessfully, suffering heavy casualties. Some dead and wounded Italian soldiers were abandoned on the battlefield. The battle of Corene is continuing to develop, although not very fast, it is progressing smoothly. The British army in central and southern Abyssinia is continuing to press forward against the retreating Italian army in various areas. (Reuters report, 22nd)

Cairo – The British General Headquarters announced late last night that Gala-el-Hbeib, 40 miles inside the Libyan border (150 miles inside Tobruk), had fallen into British hands. The 900 Italian troops stationed there and their commander were also captured. The communiqué stated that as the important battle in Cyrenaica, eastern Libya, continued, the British decided not to attack Gala-el-Hbeib, but to send small teams of scouts to monitor it. In the past few days, they finally obtained an opportunity to clear the battlefield and sent a team of British and Australian troops to attack. The engagement began yesterday, and after a short period of time, the commander of the Italian garrison in Gala-el-Hbeib surrendered his entire force in the afternoon. During the siege of Gala-el-Hbeib, the British army paid special attention to avoid damaging the remains of the Senussi sect, whose founder was healed there. (Reuters report, 22nd)

Germany Forms Colonial Army; Operates in Libya

Capital of Switzerland – The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" recently published a telegram from Berlin stating that Germany has formed a "colonial army." Although not officially announced, magazines often refer to German troops operating in Libya as the colonial army. The officers and soldiers of this army are all equipped for the tropics. (Havas Agency report, 22nd)

Italian Somaliland; Tribal Chief Leads Troops in Rebellion Against Italy

Cairo – According to an official announcement here, an important tribal chief in Italian Somaliland recently led his troops to surrender to the British commander in the Middle East. (Havas Agency report, 22nd)

### German Aircraft Launch Another Fierce Attack; Plymouth

Plymouth – After suffering unprecedented bombing here on Thursday night, German aircraft groups flew here again last night and dropped more than a thousand high-explosive bombs, with a very fierce force. Most of the shops and houses in the city were destroyed, with heavy losses, which cannot be estimated for the time being. (United Press report, 22nd)

Berlin – On the evening of the 20th, German aircraft concentrated their bombing on Plymouth. The weather was good at the time, and the visibility was clear. German aircraft hit important military targets, and fires broke out everywhere, with the burning area covering four square kilometers. The British naval arsenal and harbor were hit by heavy bombs. The British naval supply headquarters was also hit and caught fire. Several merchant ships in the harbor were hit and caught fire, and their hulls have tilted. (Haitong Electric report, 22nd)

London – As of dawn this morning, there were no traces of German aircraft in the London area. However, enemy aircraft had sneaked into a town on the southwest coast. Although they encountered fierce anti-aircraft fire, they dropped incendiary bombs and bombs from high altitude. During the day yesterday, German aircraft were not very active in England, only dropping bombs in two places on the Norfolk coast and several places on the Kent coast, and strafing a town on the southeast coast with machine guns. According to official sources, the damage was slight, and no residents were seriously injured. (Reuters report, 22nd)

### Random Talks on the European War (4) (1) General Remarks on European War Strategy

This is a general discussion of European war strategy by the famous British military strategist Colonel Haud, originally published in the New York Herald Tribune, and translated here:

American commentator on important matters, Baldwin, once said in a vivid and insightful article, "The defense of the British Empire is naturally built on three major foundations: the first is the ocean, upon which the greatness of the British Empire is based; the second is the machinery of Manchester and the Midlands, upon which Britain's weapons of war depend; and the third is the air force."

He also said, "Now, due to the shift in the war situation, the British defense concept is very different from the arguments in Colonel Haud's book "Defending Britain," published before the start of the war," which surprised me.

Simply put, my view is that we should concentrate our greatest strength on the navy and air force, and reduce our efforts in the army to a minimum. However, we must have sufficient troops to defend our overseas territories, and we must have mechanized attack units to deal with situations where German forces break through French lines.

This theory is not empty, but based on practical considerations. If we spread our strength and try to make all aspects strong, the result will inevitably be that we lose sight of one while attending to the other, and none will be strong. This is a major mistake that Napoleon spoke of.

To form a powerful army is not only impossible in a short time, but also requires a large amount of industrial and financial resources, which are of course more urgently needed to maintain the navy and train an incomparably strong air force. Since the last World War, I have always argued that air supremacy will be a decisive factor in the Second World War.

Although I have advocated training mechanized attack units to be sent to France and the Middle East to fight, I have also stated that large numbers of infantry sent to Europe in batches will face the risk of their transportation lines being attacked and cut off by air force or mechanized units. Once transportation is cut off, the British forces in France will be in a dilemma and find themselves in a difficult situation.

Therefore, it is better to use the industrial surplus beyond what is needed for the navy, air force, and mechanized units to provide modern equipment to France, so that their well-trained and large army can increase its strength. This is not the "theory of limited liability" but the basic common sense of fulfilling "preserving strength." A country that is invaded can only compete with time and win by appropriately directing its efforts. This is an unbreakable truth.

However, calm planning and a sense of proportion have been obscured by emotions and prejudices. Our allies only seek a large army, while neglecting the air force and air defense equipment. We are also putting the cart before the horse, and instead of focusing on emergency measures in the face of imminent disaster, we are training a large army.

Looking back, if our air force could have been on par with Germany's, the war might not have happened. This should be a commonly known fact. Even if the war could not be avoided, if our fighter and anti-aircraft gun strength had been twice as strong as last summer, or if a few mechanized divisions had been stationed in key locations and immediately counterattacked when the German forces broke through, the German invasion of France would have been hindered, and the threat to Britain would have been completely eliminated. Achieving this goal would have been easy, but it was delayed by traditional military concepts.

In this war, French and Belgian troops lost their ability to resist due to a lack of fighters to drive away German dive bombers. When the German forces broke through Sedan, they were unable to resist due to a lack of armored divisions, causing a fatal blow to the Allied forces.

In 1937, I suggested to the Minister of War, Mr. Belisha, to train six armored divisions, four of which could be sent to France to fight. However, in May 1940, when the German forces attacked, Britain only had one division that could be dispatched, and this division was stationed on the other side of the strait, and could not immediately go to help. As a result, the 400,000 infantrymen we sent to France were cut off from contact by the enemy, lost most of their equipment, and almost escaped empty-handed.

Mr. Baldwin believes that my current estimate of defensive power is as high as it was in my pre-war book "Defending Britain." In fact, looking at the past war situation, I can only answer him by saying that if the comparison of the strength and situation of both sides can be properly taken into account, then not only have I not overestimated the strength of the defense, but I have actually underestimated it. I have published this conclusion in the book: Generally speaking, the army taking the offensive must have a three-to-one advantage over the enemy, not only in terms of numbers, but also in terms of modern mechanized units such as airplanes and tanks.

The German army's estimate of modern defensive power seems to be no lower than mine, and in fact may be even higher than my estimate. Before taking the offensive, they were cautious and carefully created a three-to-one or greater advantage in modern equipment such as airplanes and tanks. According to reliable reports from the London Times, their airplanes were in a ratio of four to one, and their tanks were in a ratio of five to one. Moreover, I and a group of people who advocated mechanized warfare early on have stated that in future wars, it is necessary to adopt mobile tactics and surprise methods. When the German army took the offensive this time, it was able to fully develop the key points of this new war defense.

Not only that, but regarding the proportion of advantages, I carefully said in my pre-war conclusions that in certain situations, the proportion of advantages may not even reach a ratio of three to one. First, the attacking army only needs to strategically use the "lure the enemy" strategy to make the enemy empty out and swallow our bait; second, the battle line must be vast, so that the attacking army has ample room for activity, chooses the enemy's weak defenses, and takes advantage of the opportunity to attack its unpreparedness; third, the attacking army should use new weapons or new tactics to take the enemy by surprise and make them lose their resistance; and fourth, the defending army should have no leadership and improper command.

I have also said that the defending army must have sufficient airplanes to protect the airspace before it has any hope of resisting the enemy's superior army.

Although the German army had a great advantage in strength, they were still cautious and unwilling to risk attacking the Maginot Line head-on. Instead, they attacked the low-lying countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, on the one hand luring the French army away from the strong defensive works, and on the other hand extending the battle line as much as possible to obtain a large space for activity. At the same time, paratroopers and heavy tanks enabled them to achieve surprising victories.

In addition to these many advantages, the French Prime Minister's said "unimaginable mistakes of the French High Command" also contributed greatly to the German victory. The British and French troops did not know to rely on strongholds to defend and wait for the enemy to tire, but instead lightly left their base and advanced seventy miles, deep into Belgian territory, to defend an unprepared line on the Dyle River. Perhaps this was unavoidable due to political relations!

However, the actual military deployment cannot be explained by this. The entire left wing of the Allied forces advanced into western Belgium, but there was no defense in the area around the attacking hub of Belgian Luxembourg. It seems that they blindly used the principle of concentrating main forces according to regulations and misunderstood that the Ardennes forest was overlapping and hilly, and that the enemy's mechanized units could not be used there, which led to this mistake.

### Group Kidnapping and Shooting: Misfortune for Bank Employees; Nearly Two Hundred People Kidnapped from Bank of China Villa; Eleven Dead and Wounded Among Jiangsu Farmers Bank Employees

At around 11 PM the day before yesterday, a shocking bloody incident occurred at the dormitory of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank at No. 10, Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Eleven bank employees were tragically victimized innocently. Before long, more than one hundred bank employees in the Bank of China's staff quarters at No. 96 Route Ghisiere were suddenly handcuffed and kidnapped by armed personnel and plainclothes officers. At 5:45 AM, more than seventy people were kidnapped again. A total of nearly two hundred people were kidnapped, which is a shocking kidnapping case. The severity of the situation is unprecedented. The following is a detailed account of the information obtained by the Pingming News Agency reporter:

Group Kidnapping Case

The Bank of China Villa at No. 96 Route Ghisiere, located near Route Keane, an extra-settlement road, has buildings with four, three, and two floors, numbered from 1 to 156. The houses are very spacious. The employees of the Bank of China in the two concessions of this city live there. Some live alone, and some live with their families and children, totaling about four or five hundred households, or about three thousand men and women. The Bank of China employees in the dormitory usually take a group car dispatched by the bank, except on holidays, to facilitate the employees' commute. At around midnight last morning, nearing curfew, dozens of armed personnel and plainclothes officers suddenly arrived in two cars. The employees in the dormitory were already in bed. After entering, the men woke them up one by one, handcuffed more than one hundred employees in pairs, and forcibly dragged them away. At that time, the families and children of the employees were shocked by the scene, but they could do nothing but watch them drive away.

Nearly Two Hundred People Kidnapped in Two Incidents

Not long after, at about 5:45 AM, a large number of armed personnel and plainclothes officers went to the site again and forcibly escorted another group of more than seventy employees onto a large car that usually picks up bank staff, parked inside the iron gate of the Bank of China Villa. The driver, Zhao Qilin, was forced to drive it south on Route Ghisiere and disappeared. In the two kidnappings, the number of people was close to two hundred, all of whom were middle- and lower-level employees. These people depend on their salaries to make a living and usually do not participate in political activities. It is understood that most of them were from the Chengdu Road office, and some were also from the Avenue Joffre, Tongfu Road, Rue Massenet, and Xinzha Road offices. Afterwards, more than a dozen armed teams guarded the entrance of the Bank of China Villa until they withdrew at 11 AM. It is rumored that a bank employee was kidnapped from the dormitory a month ago. All circles believe that the occurrence of this case is serious. After learning of this shocking mass kidnapping incident, the police authorities of the two concessions immediately sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to station at the entrances of the various branches of the Bank of China to provide strict security and protection.

Partial Release After Negotiations

Yesterday, a Datong News Agency reporter inquired with a senior official of the Bank of China about this matter. According to him, after negotiations by Mr. Hu (director of the Nanjing branch) of the bank in the morning, most of the personnel had been released. Starting next week, everyone can go to the bank to work as usual and will not delay business due to this matter. The reporter asked whether there were any senior officials living in the house. He said, "There are also some living there, such as the head of the cashier department, Mr. Tao Jincheng, who was also kidnapped and has not yet been released." Since the incident, the employees of the Bank of China's offices in this city have been very calm. Yesterday morning, they still operated as usual and were not affected. Yesterday morning, the financial market experienced a brief disturbance due to this incident. However, because a part of the staff released not long after and it was found that this matter would not have a major impact on Shanghai's finance, the market turned to be stable again. The reporter also asked someone from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department about the motives of this incident. According to him, they only knew the facts, and the motives were unknown. The Japanese authorities said that they had nothing to do with this matter, and the "Special Police" of western Shanghai said that they did not know about the incident.

List of Kidnapped Personnel

It is reported that the Bank of China personnel who have been identified as being kidnapped include Mao Yongfeng, Tao Jincheng, Zhang Xiaohang, Yan Zhiqiang, Zhang Liwei, Zhang Qiyun, Zhang Aiqi, Xu Yichen, Cao Shanqing, Ni Xiaoben, Qiu Qidi, He Huanbiao, Chen Nianqin, Zheng Shikang, Lu Hongchou, Zhu Shaohui, Lu Weihan, Sun Xiaonong, Hong Liren, Chen Guoxiang, Jing Guangzhao, Shen Weian, Gui Zhengrong, Wang Yifan, Yang Jicheng, He Shuangfu, Xu Banggui, Yu Zhaoan, Guo Zhongyun, Tu Hengren, Tang Fucheng, Sun Xingchu, Zhang Yanbo, Liu Lansheng, Mao Shiyang, Yang Zhongqu, Chen Shaowei, Hong Jiaxiu, Jin Wangtong, Gu Jian, Zheng Xueheng, Zhang Junfu, Xu Zhaoqing, Shi Guoqing, Wu Jiayuan, Wang Zhaoxuan, Gao Changlun, Lin Zhenlin, Dong Hanhan, Chen Zhaogui, Shen Xingsheng, Wu Zhongguo, Zhu Xinghan, Zhuang Xiaojin, Bai Zunwu, Zhou Ji, Yan Tongwen, Fan Zong..., Tian Baoqing, Zhu Songren, He Liyun, Li Gonglin, Zhang Fuzhai, Lao Guangchu, Lao Lizhai, Ni Biaodong, Jin Bingzhang, Jing Tailai, Zhang Zuda, Huang Shizhen, Zhu Jianming, Cao Xiangguang, Xu Deqing, Zheng Chunxi, Liu Bangda, Xu Maozhao, Han Xinbao, Kuang Yongxin, Lu Zijin, Liu Benkun, Lin Maosong, Jiang Chuanlin, Yao Shirong, Jiang Xiaodi, Zhang Jia願, Lu Shude, Qin Bingkuan, Zhang Xianda, Gao Ben, Jiang Renliang, Chen Zilin, Meng Shulian, Yan Huanzhang, Zhou Yaojin, Chen Yaliang, Xu Bingsong, Qian Tingdong, Wang Zengqi, Zhang Yongzhong, Yang Tongwu, Xue Yidu, Gui Qizhang, Zhang Maosun, Liu Yongquan, Wu Yuying, Wo Hongyu, Zhang Zhidong, Jiang Zishan, Zhu Qiutao, Du Qingzao, Huang Nian, Ye Xuhua, Zhang Chenglian, Lu Qingpei, Zhou Qizhi, Mu Kexin, Hua Zengxiang, Ge Binggu, Zhao Quanlin, Yang Zhiluo, Ye Naiqiu, Yang Yihe, Yang Shaoqing, Hong Jieren, Ma Buzhou, Shen Zhenyi, Yu Guoliang, Yu Tingyun, and others.

Unprecedented Shooting Massacre

At around 11 PM the night before last (the 21st), a shocking bloody incident suddenly occurred at the dormitory of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank at No. 10, Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. At that time, eight murderers posing as detectives from the patrol station broke into the dormitory and fired more than three shots. Details of what was seen in yesterday's newspaper are continued below.

Opening Fire: Blood Splatters Everywhere

At 11:50 PM the night before last, two black-plated cars carrying many men, all carrying box guns, and one carrying a submachine gun, suddenly stopped at the entrance of Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre. At that time, one of the cars blocked the entrance of the lane, and a machine gun was set up. Then, six men jumped out of the car. Two of them pointed guns at the gatekeeper of the lane, Zhang Deyuan (34 years old, from Jiangbei), and monitored him. The rest walked to the entrance of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank dormitory at No. 10, pressed the doorbell. At that time, Ling Chuan (52 years old, from Songjiang), the tea servant who was sleeping downstairs, had already been awakened and got up to ask. The visitor answered that they were night investigators. Ling thought they were patrol station personnel and hurriedly pulled open the iron gate and opened the door to let them in. Unexpectedly, they each took out box guns and ordered Ling to lead them upstairs, straight to the dormitory on the second floor. They woke up the six employees in the room who were fast asleep, forced them to get up, and then went straight to the third floor and the fake fourth floor. They gathered all eleven employees in the bedroom on the second floor, had them stand in line, and opened fire on them without asking questions. Five or sixty shots were fired, and blood splattered everywhere for a while. It was a terrible sight. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the men went outside, jumped into the original car, and fled.

Six Dead, Five Injured

Afterwards, gatekeeper Zhang Deyuan reported to the Avenue Edward VII Patrol Station based on the information, and a large team of armed Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to search the vicinity, but to no avail. They immediately entered to investigate and found that five of the employees who had been shot had died on the spot from their serious injuries, while the rest were groaning in pools of blood. They then called for cars to send the dead and wounded employees to the coroner's office and the hospital for treatment. In this incident, the employees who were tragically killed included (1) Zhang Shaozhen (from Yancheng), (2) Wan Deyi (from Zhenjiang), (3) Xue Yushan (from Yancheng), (4) Chu Hualong (from Rugao), and (5) Fan Jingjiang (from Zhenjiang). The injured included (1) Xi Shen (26 years old, from Nantong), (2) Zhang Shusheng (25 years old, from Huaiyin), (3) Li Kewen (from Yangzhou), (4) Cheng Xiuming (32 years old, from Shanghai), (5) Shen Yongzuo (from Yancheng), and (6) Tao Zhongqi (30 years old). Among them, Xi Shen was shot in a vital part and died in Guangci Hospital at 3 AM yesterday morning. Tao Zhongqi was grazed by a bullet on his waist, his injury was minor, and he was discharged from the hospital after bandaging. According to records, there were a total of eighteen boarders in the dormitory. In addition to the above-mentioned persons, there were also employees Feng Zanyuan, Xu Hanjun, Dai Daguan (all from Rugao), and tea servants Cheng Zhenyuan, Wang Chengji, 隽夢麟, and Ling Chuan. Feng worked in a small office on the third floor, so the rioters pushed open the door and entered without noticing him, and Xu heard a slight noise and quickly locked the door, so both of them were spared.

Major Banks Take Precautions

After the major bloody incident occurred, the patrol station paid attention to the various banks in the concession and dispatched detectives to station in the banks for protection yesterday morning. At the same time, iron nets were set up at various important roads at any time in the morning to search the passing pedestrians and vehicles. The patrol station has sent a large number of detectives to the No. 10 house, the location of the major bloody incident, to strictly prohibit the entry and exit of all people. The reporter went to inspect it and still saw fresh blood on the ground at the door. It is also learned that the six dead bank employees were sent to the Talas Road morgue. After examination in the afternoon, representatives of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, together with the family members of the deceased in Shanghai, claimed the bodies and sent them to the Shanghai Funeral Home to handle the funeral affairs. The five seriously injured people underwent surgery by doctors, and the treatment is going well and should not endanger their lives.

### Power Company Receives Relief: 9,000 Tons of Machine Oil; Foreign Merchant Has Agreed to Supply; But Users Still Need to Conserve

A senior official of the Shanghai Power Company told reporters yesterday that a foreign oil company in Shanghai has agreed to supply the company with 9,000 tons of oil. This move will be very helpful in solving the company's fuel shortage problem, because one ton of oil can produce the same amount of electricity as one and a half tons of coal. The official warned users not to expect too much from this matter, because this amount of oil can only slightly improve the fuel shortage problem, but cannot fundamentally solve it. The fundamental solution still depends on improving the transportation problem. According to reports, in 1937, the Shanghai Power Company tested the use of oil for power generation to prevent fuel shortages, and later invested 500,000 yuan to build boilers for oil-fired power generation.

### Urge the Communist Party to Awaken: Abide by Past Promises; Reflect on Themselves More and Not Be Petulant; Complete the Anti-Japanese Construction in a Unified Government; The City Farmers' Association Rectification Committee Cables the Seven Communist Party Senators

The Shanghai City Farmers' Association Rectification Committee, because the New Fourth Army did not abide by military discipline, resulting in its dissolution, refused to attend the Second National Political Council, and would expand the dispute on the pretext, specially cabled a loyal admonition, to abide by promises, so as to complete the anti-Japanese construction under the unified military orders of the unified government. The following is an excerpt of the original text:

New Fourth Army Incident: Commonly Heard and Seen

Yan'an Politician Mao Zedong, and transferred to Lin Zuhan, Chen Shaoyu, Qin Bangxian, Wu Yuzhang, Deng Yingchao, Dong Biwu and other gentlemen, sir: if military orders are not uniform, how can we command operations? If military discipline is not strict, how can we succeed? The New Fourth Army despises government laws and calls it democratic politics, destroys the administrative system and calls it the anti-Japanese regime, abuses the expansion of troops and demands food from the people, calling it national salvation public grain, and excludes dissidents, blaming people and calling them stubborn elements. All these illegal and undisciplined actions are commonly heard and seen by hundreds of thousands of people in the north and south of the Yangtze River. Yet, you still believe that this is the reckless action of a few lower-level cadres in the army who do not understand the overall situation, and you have endured it for a long time. Regardless of whether you gentlemen can distinguish between right and wrong, you are covering up for it, and even using it as an excuse to make use of it. May I ask, what about the solemn oath in September 1937?

Future Actions: Watched by the Public

Moreover, after four years of combat, a dawn is in sight. The reason why our people do not avoid sacrifice, do not care about their lives, and do their utmost to support national policies is only to seek the integrity of land sovereignty and the revival of the nation and the nation. And since September 1937, the reason why we have sympathized with and looked forward to your party is also because your party has solemnly declared that it will abandon the selfishness of one party and one class and is willing to support the government and strive for national liberation. This attitude has not changed so far. In the future, our view of the real party will be based on what your party says and measures what your party does.

Work Together to Complete the Great Cause

You gentlemen are all contemporary heroes who have experienced hardships. We must guard against the danger of being together and the overturned nest. I hope that you will abide by your original intentions, practice what you preach, reflect on yourselves more, and do not be petulant, so that under the unified military orders of the unified government, the great cause of anti-Japanese construction can be completed as soon as possible. The future of the country and the nation is deeply dependent on it. Sincerely, the Shanghai City Farmers' Association Rectification Committee, bowed.

### Yangtze River Downstream Dredging Completed

The Shanghai Dredging Bureau, in view of the approaching spring tide, has decided to start dredging the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in accordance with the planned plan for the Huangpu River, Wusong River, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The large dredger "Jianshe" was dispatched to work in mid-April and was scheduled to be completed within one month. According to the Bureau yesterday, the project has progressed smoothly and has been fully dredged the day before yesterday. However, the total project of the Huangpu River, the middle section has been dredged, and the upper and lower sections are now being dredged by various small dredgers in sections. As for the dredging of the Wusong River, before the "August 13th" Incident, the Bureau sent a dredger to gradually dredge it from the Garden Bridge to the west of Brahma Royal Ferry. After the war, it was suspended, and so far the silt has accumulated day by day, and the previous work has been abandoned. Therefore, it has been decided to re-dredge it to facilitate the current flow. The Bureau has no intention of restoring the dredging of the Shintan outside the Wusongkou in the shortest possible time, because according to the current environment, dredging there is not yet necessary.

### Fund-Raising Donation Campaign: Enthusiastic Voluntary Contributions; Some Wealthy Families Donate 100,000 Yuan

Since the launch of the fund-raising donation campaign in this city, remarkable results have been achieved. Although it cannot be carried out publicly due to the special environment, it has not slightly restricted its activities due to the special environment since it is a voluntary donation. According to recent news, there are not a few wealthy merchants and wealthy businessmen who donate 10,000 or 20,000 yuan alone, and there is no need to mention those who donate thousands of yuan. It is said that a certain wealthy family in Shanghai has scheduled to donate 100,000 yuan, which can be said to be the highest record of national fund-raising donations.

### Xu Weizhen: No News After Being Kidnapped; Hospital Affairs Proceed as Usual

Since Xu Weizhen, the president of the Higher Court Second Branch, was kidnapped, there has been no news. A Pingming News Agency reporter went to the Higher Court Second Branch yesterday to visit the responsible officials. They claimed that the hospital had no news about the kidnapping of President Xu. However, this is purely President Xu's personal misfortune and has nothing to do with the entire hospital. Since the Central Government issued a clear order for Judge Guo of the Second Special Court to temporarily act as the president, the responsible person has been appointed, and the hospital affairs are proceeding as usual and will never be interrupted. Then, it was also claimed that regarding the dredging of the prison, it is said that it is based on the Interim Measures for Serving Sentences Outside Prison promulgated by the Central Government. The Shanghai Municipal Council Prison is also applicable. Inmates of good character, after being reviewed by the prison warden and approved by the court, can be released on bail to work outside. As of last year, it is estimated that one or two hundred inmates were released on bail to work outside in accordance with the measures for serving sentences outside prison. The date of implementation of the measures has ended at the end of last year. Before the Central Government issues a clear order to approve the extension, it should be temporarily suspended.

### Public Concession Prison Guards Request a Raise

The entire body of prison guards in the Public Concession, numbering over two thousand, given that the cost of living has reached an extreme high, and their salaries are difficult to sustain them, have specially organized an overall office of prison guards, established a mutual aid group, and jointly requested assistance from the police authorities, and urged the owners to improve their treatment, in order to maintain their livelihoods. They have also submitted a detailed table of price and cost of living indexes from before and after the war, petitioning the owners to improve their treatment. Furthermore, they have newly drafted four articles of the mutual aid group's constitution: (1) To encourage the spirit of service; (2) To protect the safety of employers; (3) To ensure the safety of life and death among members; (4) To stabilize living conditions, so as to be able to serve loyally and faithfully.

### The French Electricity Strike Reaches a Stalemate, Resumption of Service Unlikely in the Near Future; Labor and Management Both Take Extreme Positions; The French Political Department Suspends Mediation Again Yesterday; The Public Concession's Transportation Strike is Completely Resolved

The strike at the French-owned water and electricity company, after efforts at mediation by the Political Department of the French police, had a prospect of resumption of work at 4:45 PM the day before yesterday. News spread, and citizens were all delighted. At that time, all the workers on the labor side had gathered in front of the factory, intending to enter immediately and resume work. Unexpectedly, due to a lack of understanding between the two sides, a sudden change occurred, leading to failure. Yesterday, the labor side announced a formal strike, and the Political Department suspended mediation again yesterday. The strike event has reached a stalemate. Citizens who heard the news were deeply disappointed, hoping that both sides would prioritize the public interest and resolve the issue as soon as possible.

Failure to Resume Work

The strike at the French electricity company, after the French police's Political Department made every effort to mediate, and presented two proposals to the labor side: (1) Resume work first; (2) The demands raised will be guaranteed to be answered in full before the 25th. The labor side considered it satisfactory and expressed agreement. Thus, at 4:45 PM the day before yesterday (the 21st), all 2,000 workers went from the Nanshi area to gather in front of the factory on Rue Luber. They then presented two preconditions for resuming work to the management: immediately release the arrested workers and remove the factory's guard. If the management agreed, they could resume work immediately. However, this was rejected by the management. Thereupon, all the workers angrily left the factory and returned to the Nanshi area. There was a minor disturbance at the time, but fortunately, no accidents occurred. However, the effort to resume work ended in failure. The widespread rumors of resumption of work originated from this.

Formal Strike

The labor side, after this incident, felt quite stimulated. At 10:00 AM yesterday, they convened a general meeting in the public sports field in Nanshi, believing that the past few days had only been a slowdown, and resolved to formally strike from yesterday onwards, and organized a "Strike Committee," extinguishing the glimmer of hope for resolving the labor unrest. However, according to the labor side, if the management agrees to release the arrested workers and remove the guard, they can resume work at any time, in order to hold negotiations to resolve the matter. However, the management has already refused to recognize the matter of arresting workers. Since this incident occurred, the French authorities have increased security for the water and electricity company. The iron mesh barriers on Rue Luber, Rue Conty, and Rue Luber at the intersection of Xujiahui Road, which were previously allowed pedestrians to pass through, were completely closed yesterday. At the same time, inquiries were made to the company's management. Because the labor side insisted on striking, the company side has allowed it to take its course. Furthermore, there is currently a shortage of both coal and diesel, so there is no urgent need to resume work.

British Electricity Resolved

The conditions for improving treatment proposed by the workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramway Company, after labor and management both expressed sincerity in negotiations, were directly negotiated at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday by six representatives from the labor side, with the company's manager, Evan, and compradore, Hu Ziyu. An agreement was reached and announced, resolving the issue: (1) A 10% increase in wages and a 15% increase in living allowance (totaling a 25% increase); (2) A rice subsidy, where for every 10 yuan that the price of rice per picul exceeds 100 yuan, the rice subsidy will increase by 20 cents per person per day; (3) The company recognizes six worker representatives; (4) The calculation of special bonuses includes allowances.

Public Buses

The workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, due to issues of compensation, went on strike on the 19th. After mediation resolved the issue, all the workers resumed work that evening. The worker rice subsidy for March was issued by the company the day before yesterday, with each person temporarily receiving 55 national currency yuan for five piculs of rice, and the retail price of rice surveyed by the Public Works Department on March 21st was used as the standard for the rice subsidy price. As for the workers' living allowance, the company agreed to consider it. Yesterday, the worker representatives negotiated again with the company's manager, Arnold Jones, and agreed that the worker's living allowance would be increased by 65 cents per person per day, totaling one yuan with the previous 35 cents.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Elections Expected to be Resolved Smoothly; Understanding Reached Among Expatriate Communities; If an Agreement is Reached, Elections May Not Be Necessary

According to the "The China Press", sources from the authorities state that the Shanghai Municipal Council has submitted a request to the Consular Body, suggesting that the originally scheduled annual Council elections on April 2nd and 3rd be postponed by one week, and changed to April 9th and 10th. If this request is approved, expatriate groups in Shanghai can use this period of hesitation to adjust the issue of seats on the Shanghai Municipal Council for the coming year, and the Municipal Council elections may not need to be held. Recently, there have been many rumors about the Municipal Council elections, but none have been confirmed. A more credible report is that all parties are now trying to reconcile several long-standing disputes. This work is progressing very smoothly, and it is hoped that results can be achieved before the election is held. Municipal Council officials neither acknowledge nor deny that the Consular Body has approved the postponement of the election, only stating that they cannot express an opinion until they receive formal notification from the Consular Body. However, information obtained from other sources confirms that expatriate groups have been discussing the issue for several weeks, and have reached an understanding on the upcoming election of the Municipal Council. Responsible parties claim that if expatriate groups can reach an agreement on the issue, they will nominate candidates in accordance with the existing seats. If this is the case, the Municipal Council elections may not need to be held.

### Jing'an Temple Police Uncover a Counterfeit Currency Organization, Detain Ten Male and Female Suspects, Confiscate Over 1,000 Yuan in Counterfeit Currency

### Finance: The Future of the National Currency Becomes Brighter, The Black Market Shakes More Violently, News of Huang Lun Having Stopped the Supply of Black Market Foreign Exchange, Foreign Merchants Eagerly Rush to Buy Foreign Exchange, Becoming Unusually Active

Regarding the foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC listing remained unchanged. The trend in the dark market for British and American foreign exchange was tightening. According to a telegram from London, the recent weakness of China's national currency is due to China's Exchange Stabilization Fund not wanting to support the black market, not because China's Exchange Stabilization Fund is unable to do so, but because it is unwilling to do so. Currently, negotiations are underway between China and Britain to ensure that British gold's aid to China's Exchange Stabilization Fund is not used to support Shanghai's black market, so as to reduce leakage. Therefore, there is a saying that the Exchange Stabilization Board will stop supplying foreign exchange to this city. As a result, people's hearts are agitated. In fact, this kind of action is within the range of what should be done. If Britain and the United States want to maintain the national currency, then the most important question is how to maintain the funds they supply. If there is no way to solve this problem, the effect of supporting the national currency is equal to zero. Although the funds for maintenance come in continuously, and the foreign exchange in the black market still flows away continuously, then what is actually being maintained is not the national currency, but those who use the national currency to seize foreign exchange. Therefore, Britain and the United States would rather not maintain the Chinese national currency. If they want to maintain it, they must first find a way to plug the loopholes in Shanghai's black market foreign exchange. The way to plug the loopholes is nothing more than stopping the supply of foreign exchange. At the beginning of its implementation, it seems that the price of foreign exchange will soar and the value of the national currency will plummet. In fact, it is precisely the price of the national currency that will be as firm as a diamond and as constant as the sun and moon from now on. Small collapses will not completely destroy it, and the value of the national currency reflected by the temporary sharp drop in foreign exchange prices is a fantasy created by the eagerness to seize foreign exchange with the national currency. It is a temporary surge in the need for foreign exchange, and the supply may be interrupted. There are many who seek it, and few who supply it, so it seems that foreign exchange is very precious, and the fall of foreign currencies is frightening. I don't know that the true exchange rate of the national currency against foreign exchange will only see it rise, and will not see it fall, but the black market is the opposite. As for Chinese merchants who need foreign exchange for legitimate and reliable purposes, if the supply of foreign exchange in the black market really stops, then the foreign exchange obtained through applications and permissions will be longer than that obtained from the black market. Therefore, the realization of this measure will only increase the value of the national currency, rather than devaluing it again. Yesterday, general foreign banks were already planning ahead and buying foreign exchange from the black market, causing the black market exchange rate to tighten again. Japanese merchants especially rushed to buy, fearing that this opportunity would be missed and not easily obtained again. Speculators also bought more and sold less, causing the market to be easy to tighten and difficult to loosen. At noon, it softened to 32.25 cents and 5.3125 yuan, but the closing price was 32.265625 cents and 5.34375 yuan, resulting in a squeeze of 0.046875 and 0.0625. Futures were slightly tighter.

A Buying Spree Temporarily Prevails

In the early morning, due to the large London contracts, the near-term contracts were squeezed by 0.0625 each. New York silver prices and London raw gold were both flat. Exchange rates, such as the US dollar against Shanghai, did not fluctuate. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning. British gold was 32.3125 cents, and the US dollar was 5.40625 yuan, with no honor or disgrace compared to the previous day. It was still flat after opening, but soon there was a certain good news rumor in the banking industry in this city, and a buying spree suddenly broke out. Japanese banks and speculators bought and sold each other, and the market tightened as a result. It is estimated that the March contracts were opened at 5.40625 yuan and 3.375 for the US dollar. The HSBC listing was announced to remain unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced to be slightly 0.025. After that, the foreign firms also followed suit, and the situation gradually softened. At 10:15 am, British gold had tightened to 32.28125 cents, and the US dollar had shrunk to 5.34375 yuan. Then, the buyers slightly decreased, and it had turned flat. The current US dollar can be settled at 5.375 yuan. Hedgers had tried to sell, but soon heard a telegram from London, saying that the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee was afraid of not maintaining the Shanghai black market. The buying spree then reignited, and foreign firms and speculators came to buy again. It is estimated that the March British gold contracts were opened at 32.28125 and 25 cents, and the March-April US dollar was 5.34375 yuan. At noon, the current US dollar shrank to 5.3125 yuan, and British gold softened to 32.22 cents. However, the closing price was slightly flat. British gold was reported at 31.265625 cents, and the US dollar was 5.34375 yuan, while futures British gold was reported at 32.25 cents, and the US dollar was 5.3125 yuan. As a result, spot British gold tightened 0.046875, the US dollar softened 0.0625, futures British gold shrank 0.0625, and the US dollar tightened 0.09375 compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

The "Joint Note" dark market rose slightly by one dime, to 70.09 yuan.

### Many Things Happened in the Financial World, Gold Prices Soared

Yesterday's gold market was a dark market, because shocking incidents occurred in the China and Su Nong Banks in this city. At about 10:30, a London telegram stated that the Exchange Stabilization Board would stop supplying foreign exchange to this city, causing the vain hearts of all parties in recent days to be terrified and suddenly prosper. The dark market for foreign exchange tightened, causing gold prices to soar in an extraordinary buying spree. The price had flown out of the 6,400 yuan mark. With the buying momentum of Tianyuan, Rencheng Yong, Dafeng, and Hengji, the securities gang Yida actually bought more than 10,000 taels. The supply and demand situation was very different, so in a situation where it was easy to rise and difficult to return, the price rose from 6,370 yuan in the morning to 6,490 yuan. Later, gold and silver shops reappeared, and the noon animal husbandry slightly fell to 6,479 yuan, still squeezing up 119 yuan. 45,000 taels were traded in half a day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The off-market price soared again to 6,525 yuan. The seller of the swap (March to April) had to pay the buyer 50 yuan. No cash price was heard. The forward price was 250 to 270 yuan higher. Ornaments rose by ten yuan, reaching 690 yuan. Customs gold, etc., were all flat.

500 Yuan for Customs Gold Off-Market

At the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels), at the opening, because the exchange market reported tightly, most shouted to buy in accordance with the listing, and immediately raised ten yuan, to 6,370 yuan. After that, coupled with rumors of a certain building doing well on the market, it was difficult to settle the US dollar at 5.40625 yuan for this month, and the buying spree became more heated. Tianyuan, Yida, and Rencheng Yong came to absorb first, and soon Dafeng, Hengji, and Xianghe also followed and forced their way in, soaring eighty yuan, reaching 6,450 yuan. Later, the exchange market stabilized slightly, and Tong Kangyong, Defu, and Xiangxing Yong suddenly had the intention to sell, once falling back to 6,420 yuan, but eventually because the foreign exchange softened again, Dafeng frantically bought on behalf of the hedgers, and Tong Kangyong and Defu also changed from selling to buying, and rose again to 6,475 yuan. Then, Shunyuan and Decheng spat out, and it fell back slightly again. At this time, Hengji suddenly tended to spit and plug, and it also fell back slightly to 6,440 yuan. Eventually, because people's hearts were upward, and it was heard that the London telegram said that the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee had abandoned maintaining the black market foreign exchange, the short side Shunyuan, Lianxing, etc. painfully cut and settled, and Xianghe also bought. By noon, it had actually risen to 6,490 yuan, but before the close, Chengji and Hengji sold off, and the result was 6,470 yuan, 119 yuan higher than the previous day. The closing price of the US dollar at 5.3125 yuan in April was 6,555 yuan, about 76 yuan. Fluctuations of 120 yuan in half a day. The off-market trend was very strong. Shunyuan Decheng searched to buy, and a lot of deals were made at 6,495 yuan. Although the market was closed on Saturday afternoon, there was a deal at 6,525 yuan off-market. The in-house gold of the spot shop was 300 yuan higher than the futures price, and the intake was 80 yuan lower than the sale. There were no openings for current standard gold, etc.

Silver Shop Ornaments are Listed at Ten Yuan Higher

The exchange price of silverware jewelry per tael, at 10:15 am, was listed ten yuan higher. Datonghang changed to hang at 690 yuan. The new shop's price was similar to the above price, and the intake was reduced by about 40 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Followed and Rose Significantly

Yesterday's foreign currency market, the dark market price soared, and British and American gold pounds rose by three yuan. British gold notes remained stagnant, and the market price stood flat. The US gold note rose from 18.24 to 45 cents, up 28 cents from the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate by three cents. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes continued to rise strongly. The former had reached two yuan, and the latter rose to 1.64 yuan.

### Food: Rice Merchants are Still Stirring up Trouble, A Large Batch of Rice and Grain Has Arrived in Shanghai

The off-market black market for foreign rice rebounded yesterday. Opening early, large customers stockpiled because of the successive days of depreciation, and they were all reluctant to let go. Seeing this situation, actual sellers were afraid of causing further major changes and sought to take action first. They searched for cheap goods, and general floating households also seized the opportunity, which was unusually difficult to control. The situation was one of reversal from weakness to tightness. Japanese merchants still had shipments, and the pegged price climbed step by step. By the middle of the market, small assorted rice had opened at 3,500 yuan and reached 3,900 yuan, and Saigon No. 2 had opened at 3,300 yuan and reached 3,600 yuan. Only Saigon No. 1 was uniquely inferior in its path and was more difficult to fully supply. High-quality goods opened at 3,300 yuan, secondary goods at 3,100 yuan, and 3,000 yuan. Fire assorted rice and Siamese rice had not been heard to open. At this point, because there were quite a few original root customers taking advantage of the high prices to leave the market, the black market's rising momentum was quelled. Afterwards, it hovered all the way until the close without rising again, and it felt that the market had become slightly softer. It is estimated that the closing price of small assorted rice was 3,800-900 yuan, middle quality at 3,700 yuan, high quality Saigon No. 1 at 3,200-300 yuan, secondary at 3,000 yuan, rice green and broken tip at 3,000 yuan, 2,800 yuan, and Tokyo broken tip at 3,500-600 yuan, an increase of about two yuan compared to the morning price of the previous market, and a massive increase of several yuan compared to the afternoon.

Thick and thin Japonica rice and other domestic rice arrived in a rush, and suddenly became tired, holding the determination to quickly sell. However, the local shops were still sluggish, so they had to shake the price to solicit customers. At that time, the falling momentum was particularly strong, plummeting by about four yuan. Kunshan dou saw high-quality white japonica rice open at 120 yuan, middle quality at 118 yuan, and secondary at 116 yuan. Qingjiao dou saw thin japonica rice open at 112 yuan. Only Changbang special japonica rice, with fewer arrivals, was not so fierce, depreciating by two or three yuan, opening at 124-5 yuan, and ordinary at 122 yuan. As for the original packages, they were not opened at four or five yuan, and glutinous rice green was 97-8 yuan to 95 yuan.

The source of foreign rice is quite prosperous. The Jardine Matheson steamboat, loaded with large quantities of foreign rice and foreign flour from Hong Kong, was expected to arrive in port yesterday afternoon, but had not arrived by evening. According to the company, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning, so the amount loaded must wait until the ship arrives in Shanghai to be known. We will report again later. It is heard that the French liner Albert Sarraut, managed by the manager of the Warren Yanghang, arrived directly from Saigon with a large amount of foreign rice, amounting to over 24,000 bags, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The Glen liner will also arrive from Saigon with a large amount of foreign rice, and is expected to arrive tomorrow. The Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes postal ship brought a huge amount of foreign rice from Saigon this time, amounting to as many as 70,000 bags, and is expected to arrive in port on the 25th. Also, yesterday, 2,000 bags of flour were transported to Yantai. (Ancestral)

### Flour Stockpiling and Price Reduction: Flour Prices Slightly Rebound

Flour: The spot market for foreign flour initially weakened but then stabilized. This was due to the increasing accumulation of inventory as flour transshipped from Hong Kong gradually arrived. Local merchants made actual sales and adopted a wait-and-see approach. Large dealers mostly stored their goods in warehouses, waiting for prices to rise before selling. Small retailers, burdened by stockpiles, were unable to sustain the pressure and began to reduce prices. "Golden Dragon" brand flour decreased to 29 yuan, while "Flower Bird Clock Tower" brand Australian flour was priced at 29.56 yuan. The price decline was quite steep. However, the market showed some signs of stabilization in the afternoon, as the rice market rebounded and local merchants and speculators bought up flour at lower prices. As a result, the market closed higher, recovering 1.2 yuan. Flat-priced flour from Chinese factories, supplied by Fuxin Mill, remained at 5,873 bags, priced at 25 yuan.

Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market maintained its usual level. The supply of inland Du wheat has been exhausted for a long time, and spot goods have been nearly completely purchased. On the Chinese factory side, Fufeng Mill has already ceased production, with only Fuxin Mill continuing to supply flat-priced flour and continuing to order foreign flour to supplement its supply. The price of high-quality Du wheat is said to be around 45 yuan. However, due to the flat decline in the flour market, the overall situation has also softened.

### Securities: Public Bonds Experience a Slight Price Drop

Public Bonds (Grey Market): Yesterday, the market suddenly experienced an unexpected price drop. This was because several employees of the Bank of China were arrested for no apparent reason. As a result, the bank still opened for business as usual until around 11:00 am. However, this sparked baseless rumors among the public, making the already uncertain bond market even more unstable. Yesterday, being Saturday, there was only one trading session in the morning. It opened slightly lower, and the sales volume from Lianhe Yiji Hengkang was quite high. Although Kang Xinfu made purchases, the market price still fell by a small amount. Later, Shunchang Hengfu made purchases, and the price rose by several cents. However, sales from Yitai Runde caused the price to fall again. In reality, this news was not particularly significant. However, it inevitably caused a slight decline in market confidence. Trading was suspended in the afternoon, and the market price ended up falling by six to nine cents across the board. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 500 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity stock were traded at a price of 8.1 yuan.

London, 21st (Friday) dispatch: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks remained flat. Only Mercantile Bank shares rebounded by five shillings, priced at 8 pounds 15 shillings. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Rumors of Favorable News Cause Cotton Yarn Prices to Rebound

The yarn market turned from weakness to strength, and the price rebound resumed. This was due to various rumors that were all beneficial to buyers, which strengthened market sentiment. However, in order to promote the sale of spot goods, factories lowered the price of "Double Horse" brand spot goods by 100 yuan per bale compared to factory orders. As a result, some who had speculated on warehouse receipts rushed to close their positions, causing the market to decline. However, purchases by Hong Kong merchants were more active, sales were brisk, and rising margins rekindled speculative buying. In short, the current situation is still in a state of fluctuation. The high price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1,404 yuan, and the low price was 1,375 yuan. In the afternoon, margins in the grey market were favorable, and market sentiment was firm, with trades done at 1,411-1,412 yuan. Yesterday, 1,225 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Morning Opening: Due to the sharp decline in the afternoon of the previous day, market sentiment for "Double Horse" brand yarn continued to be loose at the morning opening. The opening price was 1,386 yuan, and it slightly fell to 1,375 yuan shortly after. Then, it was heard that the exchange rate had tightened and margins had increased, and buying suddenly surged on the trading floor, with very high bids, pushing the price up to 1,404 yuan. However, some profit-takers sold, causing the price to fall back to 1,396 yuan. Subsequently, due to strong sales in the Hong Kong market and continued high margins, the situation was good, and the price continued to rise to close at 1,407 yuan. According to statistics, the transaction volume for the half-day was 16,000 bales. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:

Hong Kong: 1,000
Nanyang: 50
Local Traders: 14,500
Total: 16,000

### Cotton Sales Improve

The spot cotton situation remains high, but factory purchases are not strong. However, industry participants have a good outlook, so mutual buying and selling is quite active, and the situation is improving. It is noted that spot cotton for this week has increased by five to ten yuan or more compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 39,700 dan. The opening prices are recorded below:

Pengjiapo 283.5, Dade: 200 pieces for warehouse delivery

Bailuo Qu 241.0, Junchang: 200 pieces
Also 242.0, Also: 100 pieces
Also 242.0, Shen Yuanlai: 100 pieces

The New York cotton market was quiet but firm, rising due to buying by industry participants and good cotton cloth trading. The closing price was five to ten points higher than the previous day.

Indian cotton trading was very small, rising initially due to buying by intermediaries, then falling back due to profit-taking, and finally rising again due to short covering. Prices for various brands rose by one to four and a half rupees. The forecast for today's opening is a rise of one and a half rupees.

Liverpool English cotton futures fell by six points each, and there was no market for spot goods.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market is thriving because of the prospering cotton yarn market. Various parties' buying intentions are strong, so the market situation is still lively and active.

### Piece Goods: Progress in Actual Sales of Cotton Cloth

Factory Cloth: The market opened flat yesterday morning but suddenly turned firm and strong in the afternoon. This was because the gold price rose sharply, boosting the appetite of industry participants and speculators. Additionally, actual sales also progressed, so sales prices for various cloths turned from flat to rising. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece, while colored cloth, flannel, etc., rose by 5 to 7.5 cents per piece. Local street transactions involved over 600 pieces of spot goods for various cloths and over 300 pieces of futures for March-April delivery. The dyeing factories had stronger demand. Zhejiang Road, Wenzhou, and Ningbo merchants purchased over 200 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth, while Fujian and Guangdong merchants purchased over 300 pieces of blue cloth, serge, and colored twill cloth in coarse, fine, and white varieties. Yesterday, 400 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Dagu, 20 pieces to Yantai, and 1,065 pieces to Hong Kong.

Tokyo: The morning market fluctuated and rose. The spot price for white cloth, "Dragon Head" fine cloth, was 48.25 yuan. Later in the market, it was heard that the price in the grey market was rising, and market sentiment improved. However, due to the fact that it was Saturday and there was no market, there were no transactions. The closing price for "Four Gentlemen" serge at midday was 1.075 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Futures for Raw and Refined Sugar Increase

Yesterday, the sugar market experienced significant gains in raw and refined sugar futures due to speculator absorption. The guild's clearing prices for spot goods were 83.9 yuan to 84.7 yuan for No. 2-4 raw white sugar, an increase of 1.6 yuan. The prices for contracts closing at the end of March initially traded at 83.6 yuan, then rose to 84.8-84.9 yuan, a similar increase. The prices for contracts closing on April 10 initially traded at 83.8-84.4 yuan, then rose to 85.2-85.3 yuan, an increase of 1.65 yuan. Taikoo refined sugar, BF mark, for contracts closing at the end of March traded at 85.4 yuan, 85.5 yuan, and 86.0 yuan, an increase of 1.5-1.6 yuan. HX mark, for contracts closing at the end of March traded at 80.8 yuan, an increase of 0.9 yuan.

### Hardware: Ribbed Steel Bar Prices Rise and Sales Decline

Although the market for ribbed steel bars did not appear particularly active yesterday, it was not completely sluggish either. This was because construction companies in Shanghai and various inland river locations had demand, and supply was tight. The amount of stock in Shanghai was limited, leading to concerns about future shortages. As a result, those holding inventory were very bullish, and standard prices soared, rising by 200 yuan compared to the previous market. Yesterday, items such as 3-4 point goods and coarser grades above 5 points were priced at 2,700 yuan per ton. Due to the high prices, actual sales were not as smooth as in the past. In addition, sales of items such as native nails, Bess steel, tinplate, and black iron billets also declined due to high prices. For example, native nails, Bess steel, 155 yuan; Bess steel, 360 yuan; tinplate, 400 yuan (180 pounds) and 450 yuan (200 pounds); black iron billets, 3,500 yuan.

### Coal: Ample Supply of Dust Coal Spot Goods, Expected to Decline Soon

Since lump coal prices have risen, dust coal prices have followed suit, with higher grades also increasing by 20-30 yuan. This is due to a shortage of goods on the market, leading to intentional price increases. Yesterday, it was heard that a foreign firm had shipped 6,500 tons of Keelung dust coal, which was being unloaded and stored in warehouses and would soon be sold on the market. Therefore, the supply of spot goods has suddenly become ample, and a decline in prices is expected soon.

### Dried Goods: Large Slices of Dried Longan Rebound

Previously, due to a lack of arrivals of large slices of sun-dried longan, the vendors were trying their best to maintain prices. Therefore, while cinnamon longan experienced a decline in price, this item instead rose by 30-40 yuan. Now, more goods have arrived, and because prices are too high, demand is only sporadic. Therefore, vendors have secretly reduced prices by 20-30 yuan, but there are still few buyers.

### Music Education Committee Holds City-Wide Choral Concert, Attended by Over 1,000 People from 20 Units

(Chongqing Airlines News) Since the war, the Ministry of Education has been actively promoting singing with great effort. The previous singing competition and the joint concert of six universities in Chongqing were all results of the Ministry's advocacy. Recently, Minister Chen ordered the Music Education Committee to organize a thousand-person choral concert, with a thousand people each in Chongqing, Shapingba, and Beipei. Unfortunately, due to the short time, preparations could not be completed in time. Therefore, only singers with good training from the five districts of Chongqing, Shaping, Ge, Ci, and Nanquan were selected to concentrate in Chongqing for the concert. Participants totaled 21 units, with over 1,000 people. This scale is unprecedented. However, because this concert involved a large number of participants scattered in all directions, matters such as training, transportation, reception, air defense, sanitation, and the production and selection of sheet music were extremely heavy. The Music Education Committee was only handled by a few people such as Committee Member Li Baozhen, which was very difficult in reality. Therefore, Director Chen Lijang of the Music Education Committee submitted a request to Minister Chen to organize a preparatory committee, appointing Director Wang Xingzhou as the director of the preparatory committee, with Director Chen as the deputy, and Inspector Hao Gengsheng as the secretary-general, with Li Baozhen and others as deputies. The committee was divided into general affairs, arrangement, transportation, performance, publicity, security, and reception groups, led by Liu Xuesong, Hu Ran, Xing Naikang, Duan Tianjiong, Hao Gengsheng, Li Baozhen, Wu Daoyi, Luo Xuelian, Hu Bohan, Yu Daisheng, Ye Yunfeng, and Yu Ruming respectively. After discussions, eleven famous songs were selected, along with two military band ensembles. Minister Chen personally wrote the lyrics for the "Ode to Victory Year" and "Bitter Struggle", which were set to military music and accompanied by Committee Member Jin and Committee Member Li. The captains of the ten major military units in the city were invited to a meeting to select the best instruments and performers from their respective units to form a band of over sixty people, under the training and direction of Committee Member Jin Lusheng. Rehearsals were held at the Sichuan Normal University basketball court. A conductor group was also organized, hiring Wu Bochao, Zheng Zhisheng, Li Baozhen, and Jin Lusheng to conduct the songs. On February 12, the concert was held at the New Transportation Model Area Square in Fuzi Pond. Minister Chen personally attended to deliver a speech and present flags and commemorative medals. Then, all units performed singing. Because the venue had limited capacity, a special line was installed by the Central Broadcasting Station to broadcast at the Shangqingsi Broadcasting Building, Doyou Street Square, Central Park, and Jiudao Dou, allowing the entire city to listen.

### How to Commemorate the Martyrs?

--Zhang Mengzhao

Little friends, in just five more days, it will be the anniversary of the Huanghuagang martyrs! (March 29th) I believe that you little friends must have read about the stories of the martyrs who died for their country in books and know them by heart, so there is no need to elaborate here. However, how should we commemorate the martyrs? What are your plans in your little hearts? I would like to offer a few suggestions here.

First, you should collect all the portraits of the martyrs who died for their country from books or magazines, and draw them, either in pencil, ink, or watercolor. You should draw the martyrs, such as Huang Kecheng, vividly and energetically. Under each portrait, in the blank space, write down the martyrs' glorious history.

Second, on the morning of the anniversary, hang up the portraits of the martyrs that you have drawn, and silently remember them for five minutes, and salute them.

Third, older students should gather a small memorial meeting. Brothers, sisters, neighbors, and classmates can all be invited to participate. Whoever can tell the story of the Huanghuagang martyrs well should be elected as the chairman. They should explain in detail how corrupt the Manchu Qing Dynasty was, how the martyrs rose up in rebellion, how they stormed the Guangdong Governor's Office, how they fought bravely and succeeded each other, how the uprising failed, how the martyrs were killed, and why the revolution was necessary.

Fourth, everyone should sing a memorial song together: "Huanghuagang, Huanghua blooms, the flowers bloom year after year, the spirits of the martyrs remain. The immortal spirits illuminate the heavens and the earth, awakening the national soul and bringing joy."

bombing the military bases of other countries, so they are extremely busy. The situation at this time is extremely tense. Moreover, aerial combat requires quick eyes and hands, taking advantage of weaknesses to enter, which is not an easy thing. Therefore, when recruiting old flying pilots, the requirements are very strict, otherwise not only will lives be sacrificed in vain, but the value of an airplane is also very high! When airplanes perform flying stunts in the air, they often do somersaults in the air, but the pilots do not fall out because there are seat belts holding their bodies in place. Moreover, the seat belts are very flexible, and the buckle can be detached with a simple pull, and the belt can be released automatically. The flying suits worn by the pilots have no buttons, but zippers, which are very convenient to wear. If flying high in the clouds, the climate is often below zero degrees, at which time the clothes can be energized to keep the body warm. If something happens to the airplane, if it is absolutely necessary, the pilot can escape by jumping out of the airplane with a parachute. There are two forms of parachute: one is the backpack type, which is carried on the back, and the other is the seat type, which is placed under the buttocks. When the pilot jumps out of the airplane, they must finish reciting the three words "one, two, three" before pulling the parachute cord, so that the parachute can start to open. If the three words are not finished and the cord is pulled too early, the parachute will often get caught on the wing of the airplane, which is very dangerous. It is decided that Russia was the first to use paratroopers in the European war. The paratroopers were transported by airplane, carrying guns and cannons, and parachuting to the ground to fight. This tactic is very suitable for our country's old saying of "flying generals descending from the sky." Father Ah Hui stopped talking at this point, because he had finished everything he wanted to say!

### Tadpole

— Jin Xianfa

The next day, Ming went to the garden. He saw that the lawn was covered with new green, and the trees were full of pink peach blossoms. The wildflowers in the flowerbeds were vying for beauty in red and white. Moreover, swallows were soaring in the sky, and butterflies were dancing in the flower paths. He thought to himself: This is spring coming to the world! The spring breeze blew warmly, the spring sun shone on his innocent face, and he smiled happily.

Walking to the pond, he suddenly saw many black tadpoles swimming around in the green water. He squatted by the pond, puffed out his small hands, and wanted to catch them, shouting: "Brother, hurry up and get the net! There are many fun little fish here."

Qi'er was reading a book in the house when he heard his younger brother's shout. He came out and asked, "Brother, what are you shouting about? Why are you making such a fuss?"

"Brother, hurry up and get the net to catch them, they're going to escape!" Ming'er still shouted, lying on the ground with his right hand immersed in the water.

"Don't mess around, brother, get up!" Qi'er hurried over to help his younger brother up, and said, "These are tadpoles, let's not catch them."

"What are tadpoles?"

"Tadpoles are the larvae of frogs. They live in the water for more than ten days and then turn into frogs. Frogs are very beneficial to farmland. They love to eat pests, which helps the rice in our fields grow quickly."

Qi'er took his younger brother's hand and sat on a large stone under the willow tree, and continued, "If you catch tadpoles and keep them in a bottle, they will die overnight. Then you are killing many frogs. Without frogs, there will be more pests in the fields. They will eat up the rice, and the farmers won't be able to harvest anything. Without rice, we won't have food to eat and will starve to death. Yesterday when we went to school, didn't we see many poor people starving to death on the road? That's because the rice merchants are so ruthless. They refuse to sell the rice stored in their warehouses at a cheap price..."

Hearing this, Ming'er suddenly realized his mistake. He said, "I won't catch tadpoles anymore."

"That's right, brother. In another half month, we will be able to hear the sounds of many frogs singing in our pond like drumming. Do you like to listen?"

"I love to listen," Ming'er clapped his hands and jumped up. At this moment, a butterfly flew in front of him, and the beautiful flying insect, like one wearing colorful clothes, made him stare in admiration for a long time.

Qi'er also told his younger brother that to prevent the tadpoles kept in the bottle from dying, he could spread fine sand at the bottom of the bottle and put some aquatic plants in it. However, it would take a very long time for the tadpoles in the bottle to turn into frogs, and they would die after they transformed. Of course, tadpoles love freedom, and the nutrients in the bottle cannot be as rich as those in the pond.

It was time for a nap, so they walked along several winding garden paths and returned to the house. In the garden, another burst of clear and melodious warbling drifted by.

### Kang Yuan Toy Essay Contest Second Prize for Children: My Favorite Kang Yuan Toy

— Zhang Zhijie

My favorite Kang Yuan toy is the firing tank. Its gray coat, overlapping rubber wheels, and short, stout body always move with a solemn gait when it turns.

When I'm hungry, the more I look at it, the more it seems like an incarnation of my dad. Aren't Dad's eyes just like the tank's firing tubes, often shooting out handsome and lovely sparks? Dad's steady and dignified movements are even more like a slowly moving tank. I love Dad, so I also deeply love my little tank.

However, whenever I open my eyes wide, hug Dad's face, and tell him my childish imagination, Dad always smiles and shakes his head, saying: "Yijie's words are all right. From the outside, Dad really looks like a tank, and Dad even hopes that Yijie will grow up to be as brave and fearless as a tank when doing things. But, does Yijie know? Tanks, like tigers, can eat people! Countless loyal and patriotic soldiers have sacrificed under the firing tubes of tanks, and even more beautiful fields have been crushed to pieces by the giant wheels of tanks. Dad doesn't want to have the heart of a tank, and Dad deeply hates the ferocity of tanks."

So, my bright eyes began to darken. I stared blankly at the monster squirming on the table, lost in thought. Suddenly, I regained my liveliness and innocence, and happily said to Dad: "This is not the tank I love. The giant wheels of the tank I love only flatten the unfair roads in the world, and its majestic gun muzzles will only ever target violent people."

### What Kind of New Toys Do I Hope Kang Yuan Factory Will Make?

One day, I said to my dad: "The toys produced by Kang Yuan Factory are of many kinds, all really cute, truly a treasure for us children. However, I hope that Kang Yuan Factory will produce toys that do not lose the fun of toys but are also practical. Like the rocking horses that our school provides for children to ride, if they were shrunk down and made into toys, then as long as the spring is wound, the rocking horse would really rock as if there were children sitting on it, how fun! And, isn't the bottom of the rocking horse just like Dad's ink blotter? As long as you wrap it with a piece of blotting paper, it can be used for Yijie to blot ink." Dad listened and nodded in agreement.

### About Airplanes

— Jin Zhen

Last Sunday, Ah Hui's father talked a lot about airplanes. Just as he was getting into his talk and Ah Hui was listening attentively, he was suddenly interrupted by his mother. So, on this Sunday morning, Ah Hui asked his father to continue talking.

His father said to him, "Where did I get to last time? I forgot. Can you tell me?" The father was secretly testing Ah Hui's memory and even more so, he wanted to test whether he could completely "digest" and remember what he had said last time?

"Dad, last time you talked about how airplanes rise, how the machine guns on airplanes shoot, how bombs are dropped? Finally, you talked about why airplanes are arranged in triangles or chevrons? You've already talked about these, right?" Ah Hui recited such a long passage fluently.

"Good! That's right. I'll tell you a little more: Isn't it great to watch airplanes fighting each other? But the pilot's life is hanging by a thread at this time, because an ordinary fighter plane only has one or two pilots. During combat, they have to manage the machinery, shoot at other countries' airplanes with machine guns, and sometimes drop bombs."

### Reunited with Xun Huisheng

— Jing Ying

It had been several years since I had seen Xun Huisheng. Last year, there were rumors that he was coming south, but it didn't happen because he was busy opening his own Liuxiang Restaurant. This time, the check was finally cashed. He led Wang Wenyuan, Jiang Shaoqing, He Wenqian, Cao Lianxiao, Chen Xixing, Xu Hecai, He Shengqing, Zhu Binxian, and Wang Duoshou in a performance at the Golden Theater. Although the ticket price was as high as seven yuan, eight or nine out of ten seats were already booked in advance, even before the repertoire was set. Last night (the 21st) was the first day of the performance. The program was "The Complete Hongxi Celebration". Wang Wenyuan performed "Dingjun Mountain" in the first act, and Furongcao He Wenqian performed "Fanjiang Pass". I booked a seat a day in advance and rushed to the Golden Theater after dinner. By the time I got there, "Fanjiang Pass" had already been performing the sister-in-law scene. The so-called He Wenqian turned out to be He Peihua. Furongcao was listed first on the playbill, but He Peihua played the lead role of Xue Jinlian in the performance. Perhaps Furongcao was deliberately supporting her. Both of them were very good. The finale was "Dingjun Mountain". Wang Wenyuan as Huang Zhong, his singing style followed the Yu school, without losing the rules. Jiang Shaoqing as Xiahou Yuan and Cao Lianxiao as Yan Yan were also very competent. After the intermission, "Hongxi Celebration" was performed. Yu Hecai as Mo Ji had a very good voice, but his figure was a bit short. Zhu Binxian as Jin Song was also not annoying. Chen Xi and Lin Run, and Wang Duoshou as the messenger of good news, were steady. Xun Huisheng's Jin Yunü, although fat, actually stepped on the middle stilts, and they were hard stilts. The first two scenes depicting the movements and demeanor of a little girl were perfect. In the "Getting on the Boat" and "Banquet" scenes, the facial expressions were very good. Among the singing segments, the erliu was the best. Although his voice was not as soft as before, it was still smooth. His mouth and eyes were still very expressive. Because of the curfew, many lines were cut from the "Beating with a Stick" scene. After the play ended, it was already 11:35 PM.

### Ginger Rogers Also Wants to Strike

— Hu Fanfang

Ann Sheridan's demand for a raise of $1,500 per week is still deadlocked with Warner Bros. Now, according to reliable sources, Ginger Rogers, due to the unprecedented success of "Kitty Foyle", is also dissatisfied with the $150,000 she receives per film. RKO, which relies heavily on her, has reportedly relented and will increase her pay starting with her next film. At the same time, Marlene Dietrich has also reportedly made a request to Universal Pictures, but her condition is not a raise, but to be able to choose a money-making male star to co-star with her, because in the past, such as in "The Garden of Allah", the male lead was not very appealing.

Bao Ping's New Work

Following "Spring Returns to Earth", the next film is "Nice Girl". "Nice Girl" has now been completed, and her next film is scheduled to be with Charles Boyer, titled "Ready For Romance". Because Boyer is not very tall, Bao Ping does not have to stand on tiptoe when kissing him. After Bao Ping wears high heels, the two are both five feet six inches tall.

Garbo Sets Her Sights on Spencer Tracy

Garbo told people that the reason she hasn't acted in a long time is because of Spencer Tracy. Because she insisted that Spencer be the male lead in her films. But the studio has so far lacked a script that suits both of their personalities. At the same time, Spencer is putting all his energy into a film similar to "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". The female lead is intended for Carole Lombard and Ginger Rogers, but they declined due to ranking issues. It is said that Ingrid Bergman, who starred in "Intermezzo", has been invited to play the role.

Lamour Refuses to Film Nude Scene

Dorothy Lamour was originally scheduled to have a nude scene in her new film "The Road to Zanzibar", but after Lamour saw the script, she suddenly refused to film it. The studio had no choice but to do it perfunctorily. (Editor's note: Lamour's determination to abandon the "sarong" is using this film as a touchstone.)

### Four Stars Shine

It is said that there is no film in the Silver Kingdom that can match the strong lineup of "Gunga Din". Clark Gable's great lover has set up a love net everywhere. Spencer Tracy's heroic friend is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of a lover. Claudette Colbert's virtuous wife thinks of leaving, but ultimately returns to her husband's embrace for the sake of love. Hedy Lamarr's beauty unleashes inner bewitchment, almost tearing apart a struggling couple. The entire film is set against the backdrop of oil fields, vividly depicting the men's view of money at the time, not taking money to heart at all. Becoming rich overnight and becoming poor tomorrow are extremely common things. In this situation, men and women all hold the concept of "eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die", which is similar to the situation on "isolated islands" today. In a harsh environment, it depicts how a pair of heroic friends are loyal and how they reunite, which is such an encouraging medicine for the world. (Photo: Hedy Lamarr is absent, so it becomes a three-player game.)

### Blood Rain, Jade Flowers

Chapter 3: Reminiscent of Lord Pingyuan

Chen Fei's heart was stirred when he heard that Zhang Cangqiu had joined the army. So he told Zhang Cangqiu that he was originally from Pei County, Xuzhou, and had always helped in the镖局 [security escort service]. Later, because something went wrong while escorting goods to Shanxi, he had no face to return to the镖局 [security escort service] and wandered around, eventually ending up here. He had been eating and drinking at this estate for a long time, and felt very ashamed, so he volunteered to join the army and asked Zhang Cangqiu to take him along. Zhang Cangqiu saw that he spoke sincerely and readily agreed. Li Xin smiled, "Chen Zhuangshi [strong man] also wants to go to the border to serve in the army? Then I am very much in favor of it and dare not keep you any longer." Chen Fei said, "I am very grateful for Lord Li's hospitality here. I think that if a person does not go out and do something when he is young, wouldn't he be burying his life? I happened to have this opportunity, so I decided to follow you." Zhang Cangqiu said, "Then please prepare immediately, I will leave today." Li Xin said, "Why is Zhang Zhuangshi [strong man] in such a hurry? We have just met for the first time, we should get together for a while. Why don't you stay here for a few days and then leave?" Zhang Cangqiu saw that Li Xin was so fond of talented people and so affectionate, so he nodded and said, "You are truly the Lord Pingyuan of today! Our meeting can be said to be a rare thing. I will stay one more day and chat with you, but I must leave tomorrow no matter what." Li Xin saw that he said this and did not want to force him to stay any longer, so he ordered his servants to set up a wine feast, and everyone sat down as guests and hosts and feasted in the hall. Zhang Cangqiu had a very good capacity for alcohol, holding up large cups and drinking wildly like a whale. Halfway through the drinking, Li Xin said to Zhang Cangqiu and others, "Today we are gathered here, and tomorrow the two Zhuangshi [strong men] will be far away. Our meeting is accidental, and it is very memorable and rare. After this parting, I don't know when we will meet again. I feel that our intentions are very compatible, so I have a request to the three of you, which is to learn from the story of Liu, Guan, and Zhang swearing brotherhood in the peach garden in the Three Kingdoms, and become sworn brothers. If you don't despise me, then we will make a sworn pact." Zhang Cangqiu laughed first and said, "I am a martial artist, and you two are princes and nobles. If you want to become sworn brothers, wouldn't it be an insult to you two?" Xu Jing smiled and said, "You are a straightforward person, don't say that. If you agree, it would be an honor. Now, whoever agrees with what Lord Li said can each drink a cup as a sign, so as not to be polite to each other." After he said that, he drank the cup of wine in front of him first. (19)
