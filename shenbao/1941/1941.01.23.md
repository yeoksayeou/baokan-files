### U.S. Formally Notifies the Soviet Union to Lift the Moral Embargo, Seeking to Establish a More Friendly Relationship and to Cooperate in the Far East to Aid China and Prevent Japan's Southern Advance

Washington – U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles yesterday notified Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky that the U.S. has lifted the moral embargo on shipping airplanes and gasoline to the Soviet Union. The U.S. Department of State also announced that Welles had notified the Soviet Ambassador of this decision in an official letter. The official letter stated that President Roosevelt's moral embargo prohibiting the shipment of airplanes to countries bombing civilians no longer applies to the Soviet Union. The original text of Welles' letter to Umansky stated, "Dear Mr. Ambassador, after our recent series of talks, the United States Government has decided that the policy announced to the press on December 2, 1939, commonly referred to as the 'Moral Embargo,' no longer applies to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This decision has been notified to all relevant manufacturers and exporters in the United States." Welles and Umansky discussed what the State Department often refers to as "routine matters" for more than three months. However, observers believe that the purpose of these talks is to establish a more friendly relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Under the previous "Moral Embargo," almost all airplanes and their materials and attachments were not allowed to be shipped to the Soviet Union. Later, President Roosevelt also included materials necessary for manufacturing airplanes, such as zinc and aluminum, in the embargo. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)

Washington – Neutral diplomatic observers here recently recognized that the U.S. lifting the moral embargo on airplanes and gasoline to the Soviet Union is a gesture of the U.S. hoping for Soviet friendship and cooperation in the Far East. After comprehensively observing this fact along with various facts in the U.S. and other places, these observers believe that the U.S. has realized that the path of close cooperation with the Soviet Union is now unobstructed. Among U.S.-Soviet cooperation, the most important is cooperation in aiding China. This issue may be the most effective common ground for U.S.-Soviet cooperation because the U.S. is now determined to help China, and U.S. officials have long sought to establish a foundation for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to jointly prevent the Japanese from advancing southward. Many diplomatic experts believe that only when the Soviet Union threatens Japan with military force can the Japanese be restricted from attacking the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Burma at this time. Some experts even believe that the U.S. lifting the moral embargo on the Soviet Union will morally encourage the Soviet Union's Far East policy and increase China's supply of airplanes through transshipment via the Soviet Union, or even allow the Soviet Union to transport its airplanes to China, and then the Soviet Union can purchase airplanes from the U.S. to compensate. However, experts also believe that the U.S.'s current airplane production is dedicated to meeting the needs of the United Kingdom, and it may be difficult to meet the Soviet Union's large orders for a while. Diplomatic officials said that this U.S. posture is greatly beneficial to the Far East and also beneficial to the situation in Europe. The U.S. may bring the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union closer together, which is also unknown. Some diplomatic officials also said that this U.S. action is an implication that if the Soviet Union cooperates with democratic countries, it can obtain preferential treatment from the U.S. The entire tone of this U.S. expression, although said to be temporary in nature, has deep significance. The official letter to Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky was signed by U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles. The letter has been shown by the Department of State, and the content is concise and practical. The administrative department recognizes the political dangers of improving relations with the Soviet Union because Catholics and opponents of communism will use this move to attack President Roosevelt's sincerity in helping democratic countries against totalitarian countries, but the administrative department has obviously decided to adopt this reconciliation method to test the Soviet Union's reaction. Many experts have recently stated that only a joint effort by the United Kingdom, the U.S., and the Soviet Union can defeat the Axis powers. Whether this gentle posture can be considered as moving in this direction is still a question. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)

### U.S. Plans to Ask Congress to Enact Laws to Detain Dangerous Alien Elements

Washington – Attorney General Jackson said last night that the government plans to enact laws to detain dangerous alien elements in order to prevent the secret monopoly and "leaking of intelligence" by German Americans, to obstruct the national defense program, and to prevent the circulation of totalitarian propaganda. He also said that it is necessary to request Congress to enact laws to establish a way to deal with alien obstructive elements other than deportation, "because deportation is almost impossible in the current world situation." (International News Service dispatch from the 22nd)

### The Relationship Between the U.S. and Japan is Impossible to be Close; The U.S. Embargo Was Caused by Japan; Saving the Catastrophe Still Depends on the One Who Tied the Bell

Washington – Senior government leaders, including Secretary of State Hull, refused to comment yesterday on Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's speech in the Diet. However, people close to the government believe that the tone of the Japanese Foreign Minister's speech seems calmer than before. However, these people also said that the Japanese Foreign Minister's speech clearly declares that there are many differences in the views of the U.S. and Japan, and they believe that a split is possible at any time. Hull's opinion of Matsuoka's speech, with Matsuoka's remarks on the New Order in Asia, according to people close to the government, is helpful to Hull's view several weeks ago, that Japan's connection with the Axis powers aims to promote a great revolution against the current world system. In Matsuoka's speech, the traditional interests of the U.S. in East Asia are generally denied. As for his remarks on the conflict between Thailand and Vietnam, people here are particularly concerned, believing it to be the prelude to Japan's direct intervention. If Japanese troops really move in Thailand, this place will inevitably pay serious attention because the place is adjacent to Singapore. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)

Washington – People here are closely studying the remarks made by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in the Diet. Officials have not expressed their opinions, and newspapers have not had time to comment due to the late arrival of Matsuoka's remarks. However, the general impression is that Matsuoka's remarks have not changed the policy. Matsuoka advised the United States to use its best efforts to save the civilization catastrophe and recognized this as the U.S.'s treatment plan, but Matsuoka did not apply this plan to Japan. People who closely observe the situation in the Far East said that Matsuoka's remarks show that the gap between the two countries is still far away and that it is not easy to seek true closeness. Matsuoka criticized the United States for implementing the embargo, but he did not know that the U.S. embargo was caused by Japan's actions.

U.S. Feels Threatened, Only Military Build-Up

In view of Japan's actions, the U.S. has no choice but to adopt a military build-up plan, so the raw materials needed for national defense are embargoed. The Japanese side declared that under certain circumstances, it would go to war with the U.S. It is a big mistake for Japan to try to force the U.S. to maintain neutrality with this threat because this declaration only makes Americans work harder. Matsuoka said that given some time, the Nazi-style New World Order will eventually be established. It should be known that the world ruled by the Nazis is definitely not something that the U.S. can agree with. It is too contradictory for Matsuoka to make this remark on the one hand and expect the U.S. to save the coming catastrophe on the other hand. Matsuoka's remark only makes the coming catastrophe come faster unless the U.S. prepares to be commanded by Japan, but the U.S. certainly does not prepare to accept it. Observers commented on Matsuoka's expression of surprise at the U.S. recognition that its first line of defense is in the central Pacific, saying that what we need to keep in mind is that the U.S. has never threatened Japan, but Japanese cabinet members openly stated that Japan will go to war with the U.S. under certain circumstances. Since the U.S. has been threatened, how can it not pay attention to national defense? Moreover, Matsuoka said that the responsibility for maintaining peace should be equally borne by both sides and should not be blamed on one side. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)

Chinese Commentary on Matsuoka's Speech

Chongqing – China commented on Matsuoka's declaration in the Japanese Diet, saying that its content, in addition to deliberately expressing satisfaction with the mutual relations between Japan and Latin America and expressing some sympathy to Thailand, has no novelty. However, there is one layer that is meaningful and worthy of attention, that is, there are no clear threatening words for the United Kingdom and the U.S. Japan, after joining the Axis Alliance, has threatened other countries that want to participate, and the current war in Europe and Asia, with war. That is, the country that wants to prevent Japan's ambition has also been threatened. At this time, the situation has changed, and the U.S. has shouted loudly, and the intimidation has lost its effect. Opportunists are not prepared to take any action until the European Axis powers occasionally win. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)

### British-Soviet Relations

London – When the issue of British-Soviet relations was raised in the House of Commons yesterday, Under-Secretary of State Butler said that the British government had made suggestions to conclude a British-Soviet agreement on June 15 and October 21 of last year, and suggested a broader political understanding on October 22. The Soviet government has not taken any action to promote the above-mentioned suggestions, so the subsequent steps must be initiated by the Soviet Union. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)

### Three New Zealand Cabinet Members Sworn In

Wellington – Three new cabinet members were sworn in yesterday, namely Minister of Health Nordmeyer, Minister of Agriculture Barclay, and Executive Council Member Paki, representing the natives. In addition, there were some transfers, such as Minister of Public Works Semple, transferred to Minister of Railways and Shipping, and the vacant post of Minister of Public Works was succeeded by Armstrong. Sullivan, the former Minister of Railways, will focus on the organization and supply of munitions and supplies after leaving office. Prime Minister Fraser strongly stated that there is absolutely no distrust in this transfer. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)

Editorial

### A Gloomy Japanese Political Season

The 76th Japanese Diet, which was convened on December 26th of last year, adjourned immediately after its opening ceremony and began its proceedings yesterday. The period between the end of each year and the beginning of the next is Japan's regular political season, and it is also the time when its political situation is most active. There is no need to mention the heyday of liberalism in the past; even after the constitutional conventions were broken, there was Hamada Kunimatsu's famous debate; during the Sino-Japanese War, there was also Saito Takao's shocking questioning. Amidst the unprecedentedly fierce military control, he made a surprising sound, showing that the Diet was unwilling to be subservient and revealing a bit of the true intentions of the people. However, this kind of past event will not be seen again in the Japanese Diet after that! This Diet is uniquely branded with the name "Taisei Yokusankai" (Imperial Rule Assistance Association), which shows that it can hardly do anything other than exert its best efforts to support the authorities and pass the budget in accordance with the imperial edict. The members of the Diet, who used to rely on political parties, suddenly felt helpless after the dissolution of the political parties; the government also made many arrangements in advance and prevented the attempt to revive the political parties; the right-wing newspapers even demanded that the Diet focus on the U.S. and postpone the discussion of domestic political issues. Although the Diet also followed the example of putting forward a few question speakers, according to yesterday's news, it has been decided to stop the due questioning. In this way, this Diet can probably be depressed and bland until the adjournment. Compared with the U.S. Congress, which is currently in heated debate, the atmosphere is certainly very different. Even in Japan, it is an unprecedented slump in 60 years. In the near future, no matter how prosperous or declining Japan's national fortune is, or what the people's feelings are, the Diet will certainly cease to be an important hub of politics.

This evolution in Japanese politics will probably evoke infinite emotion from the old liberal elements; however, this is not the central issue in today's Japanese political situation because the Diet has long been unable to fully perform its due tasks for nine years. What is worth paying attention to is that in such an autumn of danger and distress, there is no other force that has replaced the Diet and the political parties and truly shouldered the task of guiding politics and coordinating the upper and lower levels. Konoe advocated the "New Political System Movement," intending to remedy the decline of party politics and unite the strengths of all parties with a brand-new organization and system to form a guiding force. However, everything was not as expected. For half a year, propaganda was more than construction, and the performance changed again and again. Until recently, perhaps Konoe still placed great expectations on it, but in fact, it was no longer valued by people. The foundation of the original political system has been mostly destroyed, resulting in the bleak scene of this political season. If it is said that this is to exert the effect of stabilizing domestic politics and jointly dealing with foreign countries, it is difficult for anyone to believe it.

This may be calm on the surface, but hidden beneath this phenomenon, there are still countless contradictions and oppositions. The Diet represents only the forces left over by the political parties, which is the easiest to deal with. The Tasuku Saito incident can serve as proof. Even in terms of party members, they have not completely lost their original power so far: their various activities and even the hunting of official positions after the dissolution of the parties have aroused fierce criticism from right-wing elements. In the so-called "Taisei Yokusankai" system, there are even more factions and all-encompassing. Konoe's repeated changes in the cabinet can be seen from a glimpse of its internal instability. Although the Diet has lost the function of impeaching the government, the right-wing elements and even the pro-military politicians are wantonly attacking the central government and speaking without scruples, which will make the authorities feel more difficult to deal with than the Diet, which must follow certain procedures and legal procedures. Therefore, even if the Japanese government peacefully passes the Diet juncture, it cannot be regarded as solving the internal difficulties, and if the Japanese government suffers a crisis in treatment, it will inevitably come from outside the Diet.

During these few days of the resumption of the Diet, what caused a little internal and external fluctuation was only Foreign Minister Matsuoka's diplomatic speech because it was nothing more than an indirect answer to the U.S. President's fireside chat, congressional message, and aid bill. In that speech, in addition to recounting his past "achievements," he emphasized the necessity of adjusting U.S.-Japan relations and criticized the U.S.'s attitude towards the Far East. Although the attitude was quite tough, the tone was not without sadness. Looking at the full text, it was generally nothing more than a repetition of some past statements, which was not different from Roosevelt and Hull's such grand condemnations and appeals. The only positive suggestion was to rehash the old tune of pro-Soviet diplomacy, which was nothing more than a self-deprecation in the absence of a way out for foreign countries, and did not really have any determination or belief, which was the same as its previous emphasis on diplomacy with the U.S. His various criticisms of the U.S. were also empty and superficial, familiar and well-known, and could hardly produce any effective response in any way. At this time last year, Arita's diplomatic report, although full of empty checks, frankly declared his self-confidence, unlike Matsuoka, who only expressed his depression, pessimism, and hesitation to embellish this bleak Diet.

At present, the crisis in the Pacific is increasing, and any relevant powers cannot but pay attention to it with serious vigilance. If we only talk about the various phenomena shown in Japan, there is neither tension nor magnificence, and it seems that they cannot be coordinated with its desire for expansion. In this historical political season, it further exposes the lack of connection and cooperation between the upper and lower levels. It is difficult to imagine its future if it wants to take risks in this way!

### U.S. President Announces Plans to Issue Emergency Orders, Preparing to Deal with Emergencies; Foreign Funds May Be Frozen; House Approves Allocation of 300 Million Gold Dollars to Strengthen Anti-Aircraft Gun Fleet

Washington – President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that a total of 50 executive orders have been drafted to deal with emergencies. One of them will stipulate the freezing of funds in the U.S. from European countries. The drafting of such orders is a precautionary measure but can be prepared for unexpected needs. The President also said that the saying that the U.S. Navy handed over to Britain and the U.S. Navy escorted ships across the Atlantic are all "jumping over the moon" talks. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)

Washington – President Roosevelt said yesterday that if certain situations occur, the freezing of foreign assets in the U.S. "undoubtedly" will be included in the 50 executive orders that have been prepared. (United Press urgent dispatch from the 22nd)

Washington – The House of Representatives yesterday unanimously passed the naval bill to strengthen the anti-aircraft gun fleet with US$300,000,000 and immediately sent the bill to the Senate. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)

Washington – The House of Representatives approved US$300 million by a vote of 130 to 0 to strengthen the navy to prevent air raids. This is the first bill passed by the House in the 77th Congress. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)

### Kennedy Suggests Organizing a Small Committee to Discuss Aid to Britain with the President

Washington – Kennedy told the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that the power to accelerate the national defense program is extremely needed. He testified to the House for the "Aid to Democratic Countries Act," but he said that he "deeply opposes the current form of the bill." He suggested organizing a congressional committee to discuss aid to Britain with Roosevelt and advocated that the President's power to lease U.S. supplies to civilian countries should be subject to time limits. He told Dingham, a Republican congressman from Massachusetts who opposed the bill, that if the U.S. sends the navy to fight or transport for Britain, the war is almost unavoidable. He said that the bill gives Roosevelt the power to write a blank check. He also briefly outlined his position, saying that he should do his best to help Britain because it is related to our interests. He said that Britain has been in crisis since September 1939, but if someone thinks that the so-called crisis means that Britain will succumb in 60 to 90 days, then I really don't know what they are based on. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)

Washington – Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. Kennedy stated his views on the U.S. aid to Britain bill to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, saying that people in the British government do not have a unified opinion on the issue of whether the U.S. should join the war. Some said that if the U.S. joins the war, it will definitely try to carry it out to the end, while others said that if the U.S. joins the war, the U.S.'s material assistance will not be delivered to Britain as quickly as possible, which is not conducive to Britain's war efforts. Many people in the British government also feel that they have not yet obtained all the assistance they can hope for from the U.S. When the Foreign Affairs Committee asked him to predict that there will be serious events in the next six or seventy days, Kennedy replied that he did not know what it meant, and there were many things in the military situation that he did not know, such as why the German army allowed 300,000 British troops to escape from Dunkirk. He was deeply puzzled. If the German air force was indeed invincible, as the German side said, then there should have been an opportunity to wipe out this British army at that time. Also, why didn't the German side inflict greater destruction on the concentration points of British industry? This is also something he does not understand. If the German side really has the power to dominate the sky, then a serious situation will eventually be realized, but the German side has not yet shown that it has this power. When the Foreign Affairs Committee asked him if he knew the purpose of the British war, Kennedy replied that he certainly did not know. The Foreign Affairs Committee asked Kennedy whether he thought that the U.S. should try to find out the nature of the purpose of the British war and then provide aid to Britain. Kennedy replied that he did not understand this issue and that he thought it was a matter for the State Department. Kennedy also said that some important people in the British government felt that they had not yet obtained certain assistance that they expected from the U.S. Fieschnay asked whether it was gratifying to declare that the U.S. would provide assistance to Britain in a possible continental invasion, so as not to disappoint the British people. He replied, "I don't believe we will formally do this." Fieschnay also asked whether the saying that Britain is now socialist is true. He replied that the Labour Party and the Socialist Party are now becoming important. No one can say that the situation will return to its previous state. As for the British public sentiment, he said it was commendable. He couldn't imagine there was anything better. There was less civil unrest than he had seen in the U.S. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)

Washington – Kennedy stated to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that the U.S.'s foreign policy should be based on the principle of "seeking the greatest good with the least risk." (All members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee)

### U.S. Air Defense Exercises Continue

New York – Yesterday was the first day of the U.S. East Coast air defense exercise. 10,000 civilian watchmen and the new air defense command of the regular army cooperated to defend the northeastern industrial area against enemy aircraft. Seven teams of U.S. Army bombers, serving as the imaginary enemy, flew quickly in the dark sky late last night and carried out a blitz on the important Brooklyn Navy Yard, but they were captured by the new air defense network. This defense operation was successful, and the first day of the exercise ended. (International News Service dispatch from the 22nd)

New York – Today, the U.S. will hold large-scale air defense exercises in New York City, Long Island, and the rest of New York State east of the Hudson River, as well as in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

### Provisional Fishery Agreement Signed Between the Soviet Union and Japan

The Agreement Was Signed Twelve Years Ago; Extended Five Times, Yet a New Agreement Has Not Been Concluded

Moscow – The Soviet-Japanese Fishery Agreement was signed on January 23, 1928. Subsequently, temporary agreements were successively signed to extend it on May 25, 1936, December 28 of the same year, December 29, 1937, April 2, 1939, and December 31, 1939. It expired on December 30, 1940. Recognizing that a new agreement could not be signed before the expiration date, the Soviet and Japanese governments specifically agreed to the following terms: (1) The Soviet-Japanese Fishery Agreement signed on January 23, 1928, and its annexes, shall remain in effect until December 31, 1941. (2) The current draft agreement will be replaced by a new one. The Soviet and Japanese governments are in the process of negotiating this matter and will complete it by the end of this year. To certify the above terms, this draft agreement was signed by representatives of both sides under government authorization. The signatories were Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, and Tatekawa, the Japanese Ambassador. The date was January 20, 1941. The draft agreement consists of two copies, each party holding one. (TASS dispatch of the 22nd)

Soviet Union Issues Note to Japan

Moscow – Regarding the provisional fishery agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Japan, Molotov sent the following note to Tatekawa on the 20th of this month: "To Your Excellency Ambassador Tatekawa, regarding the provisional fishery agreement signed today, I hereby present the following points to Your Excellency: (1) Regarding the special contracts established on November 3, 1938, and their annexes, the Soviet government agrees to renew them according to the previous terms, with a deadline of December 31, 1941. These special contracts permit the Japanese people to utilize fishing grounds 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40 and fishing districts 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 120, 708, 742, 743, 757, 758, 766, 767, 775, 776, 782, 829, 830, 837, 838, 839, 842, 847, 848, 854, 855, 857, 858, 860, 861, 866, 867, 975, 980, 981, 984, 985, 986 belonging to the aforementioned fishing grounds. (2) In 1941, Soviet state-owned organizations may catch 500 poods of salmon within the previously stipulated limits. (3) The lease terms for fishing grounds 410, 527, 529, 553, 557, 558, 1083, which expired in 1940, will be auctioned this year. (4) Japanese fishermen leasing Soviet fishing areas along the Pacific coast, as well as Japanese people who have signed special contracts with the Soviet government, may still purchase 'Kamchatka Company' shares from the National Bank in 1941, with a price of 32.5 rubles per 100 rubles of face value. These shares can be used to pay rent, taxes, etc., and will be accepted by 'Dalryba' (Soviet Far East Fishery Trust Company) at face value. However, if the pure gold content (based on the New York market gold price and the Japanese yen exchange rate) on the day before the purchase of 'Kamchatka Company' shares changes compared to the pure gold content on April 1, 1939 (based on the New York exchange rate), the amount paid for purchasing the company's shares will be adjusted accordingly so that the pure gold value of the payment equals the pure gold value on April 1, 1939. (5) When paying rent and fishing taxes in 1941, Japanese fishermen leasing Soviet fishing areas along the Pacific coast, as well as Japanese people who have signed special contracts with the Soviet government, should add 20% to the amount paid. Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, Molotov." Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa immediately replied that he would repeat every word of the above note and that he fully understood the contents of the note. (TASS dispatch of the 22nd)

Japanese Fishermen Pay Increased Rent and Taxes

Moscow – The Soviet Union and Japan have signed the 1941 fishery draft agreement. Before the signing, Molotov and Tatekawa had negotiated for three months. Compared to the 1940 draft agreement, the 1941 draft agreement has one important feature: the rent and taxes paid by the Japanese side have increased by 20%. In 1940, the Japanese side paid a total of 8,965,907 rubles. According to the new draft agreement, Japanese fishermen will pay an additional 20%. Furthermore, the detailed provisions regarding residual value are specified in Molotov's note to Tatekawa. This will prevent losses due to fluctuations in the Japanese yen. In summary, the new draft agreement will further develop the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. (TASS dispatch of the 22nd)

Shipbuilding Dispute Also Resolved

Moscow – According to the new Soviet-Japanese fishery draft agreement, the two sides will sign a new one this year. A mixed commission has been formed for these negotiations. Furthermore, during the draft agreement negotiations, the Matsuo Shipbuilding Company incident was resolved. The details of the incident are as follows: "On September 18, 1936, the Soviet trade representative in Japan signed a contract with Matsuo Shipbuilding Company to build three ships. The contract stipulated that if there were any breaches, a penalty of 10% of the total contract amount would be imposed. After the Soviet government signed the contract, it paid 1,647,750 Japanese yen in advance. On March 12, 1938, Matsuo Shipbuilding Company notified the Soviet trade representative that the contract had been canceled, but it did not fulfill the penalty payment and the reimbursement of the 1,647,750 yen paid by the Soviet side. Currently, both sides have reached an agreement. The Japanese side agrees to reimburse 1,647,750 yen and a penalty of 300,000 yen. At the same time, the Japanese government guarantees that the 1,647,750 yen can be reimbursed within a few days." (TASS dispatch of the 22nd)

Chongqing – Around 1:00 PM today, eighteen Japanese aircraft (it is reported that a total of twenty-seven Japanese aircraft departed) flew over Chongqing and bombed the industrial area west of the city. It was initially reported that three Japanese aircraft had been shot down by anti-aircraft fire at Ke Luo Shan (transliteration), 40 kilometers west of Chongqing, but this was subsequently denied. The air raid began at 11:45 AM, causing the public to sit in air raid shelters in the warm sunshine, resting for three hours. According to the opinions of some people, this air raid may be a preliminary test to discover if there are any surprising developments in China's defenses. Recalling the Japanese aircraft attack on January 14th, there were only nine aircraft, circling several times and firing machine guns, destroying one old civilian aircraft parked at the airfield. According to today's announcement, only 60,000 permits will be issued to residents staying in Chongqing for the summer, implying that the authorities will strive to limit the number to this amount. Currently, the city has a population of about 500,000. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)

Saigon – According to yesterday's news, large numbers of Thai mechanized units rushed into Vietnam at two locations, Cambodia and southern Laos, on Monday. One team of Thai troops advanced into certain towns in Cambodia, 30 miles inside the border. Another unit crossed the Mekong River north of Pakse. Thai artillery, infantry, aircraft, and tanks are currently launching a large-scale attack on Siem Reap (transliteration) in northwestern Cambodia. A small unit of French troops stationed there is putting up resistance, but the disparity in numbers is significant, and it is believed that they cannot hold out. The French side attempted to send bombers to assist in the battle yesterday. Officials say that the Thai advance is due to their superior equipment, especially aircraft. Although officials have not released the casualty figures, it is believed that they must be considerable. (Associated Press dispatch of the 22nd)

### Thai Government and French Side Conduct Peace Negotiations

Bangkok – The Bangkok Chronicle acknowledges that the Thai government is currently conducting peace negotiations with the French Chargé d'affaires, Grio, stating that after the Saigon radio station expressed a desire for a ceasefire, the Thai government held peace discussions with Mr. Grio. However, the two sides' opinions remained inconsistent as the Thai government did not acknowledge Mr. Grio's claim that the Thai side launched the initial attack and should first cease hostilities. Nevertheless, these negotiations are still being conducted in Bangkok. At the same time, the newspaper also published that the Saigon radio station had proposed holding a peace conference and requested that Thailand withdraw its troops to its territory before the meeting. Thailand is eager to hold friendly talks with the Vietnamese government, but expresses doubt as to whether the Vietnamese government will conduct friendly talks with Thailand after Thailand withdraws its troops.

Sydney – The Australian Army Headquarters received news this afternoon that Tobruk has fallen. Australian troops participated in the attack. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)

Cairo – The Australian Army Headquarters announced today that British Empire troops operating in the Western Desert have occupied Tobruk. Australian troops continue their glorious wartime achievements and played an important role in the attack. According to British military communiqués announced hours after the beginning of the offensive, British troops had penetrated the inner defenses of Tobruk. British troops captured a large number of Italian soldiers during the early stages of the war, including one general. The Italian cruiser "San Giorgio," docked in the port of Tobruk, was seen burning last night. In addition, fuel depots and other military supply warehouses were also seen burning. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)

Cairo – The British military headquarters here stated last night that shortly after noon on Tuesday, British Empire troops, with the active assistance of the British Navy, broke through the outer perimeter of Tobruk on a broad front and penetrated five miles into the inner defenses, and are continuing to advance. British troops have captured many enemy soldiers, including one Italian general. The Italian cruiser "San Giorgio" and piles of gasoline in the port of Tobruk have caught fire. The "San Giorgio" has a displacement of 9,000 tons, was built in 1910, and is used to defend the coast. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)

Cairo – A Reuters special correspondent with the British military headquarters cabled that the British troops surrounding Tobruk for three weeks began their attack on the city yesterday morning. Sandstorms, which have been continuous and unbroken in the desert for the past week, have blinded the sky, hindering the final phase of military operations, and troops have had to advance in the yellow sand, with visibility sometimes unclear just a few yards away. Less than a week after the fall of Bardia, British troops were in contact with Italian troops on the outskirts of Tobruk. This offensive was also carefully prepared, with patrols sent out every night to obtain intelligence about the Italian defenses and to discover that the tank traps around Tobruk were extremely deep and required ladders to enter and measure their size. The outer defenses of Tobruk are thirty miles in circumference and have a second line of defense, eleven miles in circumference, which is different from Bardia. The outer perimeter is surrounded by barbed wire. The initial destruction work by British engineers was quite difficult. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)

The Italian troops are retreating day and night along rugged mountainous terrain and are making every effort to maintain contact, but sometimes their rearguard infantry is still subjected to British artillery bombardment. The Italian troops are retreating as quickly as possible, traveling 20 miles on the first day. British Indian troops and Sudanese troops are pursuing together. Before retreating, the Italian troops held a 100-mile-long line from Om Ager (the border between Sudan, Eritrea, and Abyssinia) to Kessala, 20 miles northeast. They are now retreating to Agordat, 100 miles from the border. Agordat is the terminus of Eritrea's only railway and a key transportation point between the border and the Red Sea port of Massawa.

### The Alliance Between Germany and Italy Enters a Stage of Closer Cooperation; Italy Seeks Aid from Germany with Humility and Submissiveness; US Expansion of Aid to Britain Causes Unease in Both Countries

London: The diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" stated that Hitler and Mussolini met in Berchtesgaden. For propaganda purposes, the German and Italian sides are still shrouded in mystery, but he dares to say that the purpose of the meeting is quite simple: to hand over the Italian war machine to German management. The fact that the meeting place was not on the Italo-German border, as in previous meetings, but in Berchtesgaden, is sufficient to show that Mussolini is now in a subordinate position. This humility may be intolerable to Italian pride, and Italian propagandists will use excuses to cover it up, but it is a fact that Mussolini sought German aid at the meeting and had to accept German conditions. German conditions were to command the Italian army, even if this is not apparent on the surface, it is indeed the case in practice. (Reuters telegram from the 22nd)

Berlin: Regarding the talks between Hitler and Mussolini, Berlin stated today that the main purpose of the German-Italian alliance at present is to consolidate the victories already achieved this year. This is the plan for this meeting between the two leaders and their advisors. Both sides have fully agreed on all issues. In response to questions from foreign reporters, the spokesman said that the discussions involved more other countries and less France. The spokesman also acknowledged that the taking of diplomatic action has been thoroughly considered in the meeting. Germany is determined not to repeat the mistakes of the World War, so it must create a diplomatic front against Britain. Therefore, Germany's foreign policy must advance simultaneously with military strategy. (Haitong News Agency telegram from the 22nd)

Rome: According to what was said here yesterday when entertaining the press, the information included in the announcement of the talks between Hitler and Mussolini contained more information than initially seen. The overall review of various military and political issues by the two leaders is of great significance. The meeting process was that Hitler and Mussolini had a long talk first, and then the foreign ministers of the two countries participated in the second decision. The cordial atmosphere of the talks further dispelled rumors of tension between the Axis powers, and the complete agreement of opinions is a sign of satisfaction with the meeting by both sides. Given the close relationship between the two countries, frequent meetings between the two leaders are not surprising, but the importance of holding the meeting at this time is undeniable. As for why officials were unwilling to announce it in advance, it was because the actions of the leaders of the two countries should not be known to the enemy. (Haitong News Agency telegram from the 22nd)

New York: A telegram from Rome said that according to the news released by Italian Prime Minister's mouthpiece, Gaeta, Hitler and Mussolini discussed the situation in the United States at the meeting two days ago. (Reuters telegram from the 22nd)

Rome: Yesterday, all the newspapers in the Italian Parliament praised the talks between Hitler and Mussolini as another expression of Axis solidarity, and the alliance between the two countries has entered a stage of closer cooperation. (Haitong News Agency telegram from the 22nd)

Rome: A famous Italian journalist, Da, published an article in the "Italian Daily" yesterday, reviewing the background of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, and raised the following international issues: (1) Intensifying German air raids on Britain; (2) Strengthening Axis anti-blockade measures in the Atlantic; (3) Intensifying military operations in the Mediterranean; (4) Increasing US involvement in the war. He believed that there is no need to explain the themes discussed at the meeting and the matters already agreed upon. The facts of the future will be explained in due course. The meeting has once again proved that Germany and Italy have a consistent view and take joint action. The coordination between Germany and Italy has become a joint military action and a unified war goal to deal with common enemies. The main principle of combat is to choose the enemy's weaknesses and strike them hard. The Axis powers will strive for the initiative and cooperate to carry out this strategy extensively.

### Chaos Spreads in Romania, Plunging into Anarchy; Iron Guard Fights Street Battles with the Army; Rumor That Romanian Prime Minister Has Declared Military Dictatorship

London: The "Exchange Telegraph" reprinted a message from the capital of a southern country this morning, stating that the state of anarchy is spreading rapidly in the provinces of Romania. It is said that the Romanian economic situation is "completely chaotic." The Romanian army is seizing power from the Iron Guard everywhere. It is rumored that the Iron Guard has almost completely lost its power. At the same time, the London "Daily Telegraph" stated, "Berlin Radio said that General Antonescu has declared a military dictatorship and is trying to prevent the internal strife from sweeping the country." (International Telegraph from the 22nd)

Budapest: News from the Romanian capital says that the Iron Guard fascist military group and Prime Minister Antonescu's troops in the Romanian capital engaged in street battles yesterday. The telephone communication from Hungary to the Romanian capital has been cut off. It is reported that members of the Iron Guard have set up a coffin cart in a prominent location and are parading there, mourning the "Song of Hate." A report from a Turkish radio station heard in London said that the news received in Sofia yesterday was that communists in the Romanian capital attempted to overthrow the current regime on Monday, and many Germans were killed. Serious conflicts occurred everywhere, and the rebellion is continuing. For a while, the headlines of newspapers in Sofia called the chaos in the Romanian capital a "revolution," but the telegrams did not provide details. (Associated Press telegram from the 22nd)

London: The situation in Romania seems to be deteriorating, but the content of the messages transmitted from the Romanian capital to the outside world varies and is contradictory. Regular telephone and telegraph communications have been interrupted. According to the latest telegram from Sofia, the dictatorial Prime Minister Antonescu has lost control of the extremely serious situation. Since the dismissal of the Minister of the Interior, Petre Vicescu, the student legionnaires employed by the local governments have also been dismissed, but these students refuse to leave and have set up obstacles around them. The army ordered them to surrender, but was refused. Later, a thousand students armed with machine guns reinforced them. The police intervened, and two tanks were sent to suppress them. As a result of the conflict, the extremists won, and the military has withdrawn. There have been demonstrations in the streets, and students have formed a guard of honor, standing guard next to the corpses of their two comrades who were killed today. The Romanian Prime Minister has ordered the blockade of the Iron Guard headquarters "Green House" and various legion clubs, but obstacles have been set up in all of the above locations. The war is still going on. The Prime Minister has been unable to control the situation. The legion has been greatly expanded due to the inclusion of peasants and workers. The Romanian capital radio station was occupied by rebels on Tuesday afternoon, and their leader broadcast a request to remove the legion secretary, Liviu Georgescu, from his position. According to the New York Times report from the country's capital, Bucharest, a diplomat who had traveled from Romania to a neighboring country said that there had been demonstrations throughout Romania in the past 24 hours, with shootings and bombings, and several people had been killed. According to news from Sofia, hatred of the concentration of German troops in Romania and opposition to the Antonescu regime is growing, and the result may be a real struggle with the Nazis who are trying to restore order. Other reports say that the disturbance may be part of a right-wing coup, as confidants of the former King Carol are trying to overcome the power of the Germans and the pro-German Iron Guard. It is rumored that German troops have moved from Giurgiu to Bucharest and other places. According to a telegram from the capital of a southern country, the large-scale disturbance was launched by pro-German elements after the assassination of Colonel Dulin, and the result may require the German side to deal with it with strong measures. News telegrams from the capital of a southern country said that the Romanian army has seized power from the Iron Guard. (Reuters telegram from the 22nd)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that confirmed news of a faction of Iron Guard members opposing the Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu having occupied several important buildings in the Romanian capital has now arrived here. These Iron Guard members were then driven out by the Romanian army. The Romanian Prime Minister seems to have a firm grip on the situation. Although it is not yet possible to confirm the reports that similar disturbances have also occurred in other provinces, they cannot be completely denied. As far as it is known here, the German side did not actively participate in this disturbance, but there is no reason to doubt that the Germans will convey requests, because it is obviously beneficial for them to take advantage of Romania's unrest to advance their economic and political interests in Romania. People here also pointed out that the unrest in Romania only began after Germany occupied the country. (Reuters telegram from the 22nd)

New York: A Columbia Broadcasting Company correspondent broadcasting from the capital of a southern country said that Bucharest has declared martial law since the failure of the Iron Guard coup, and the entire city is now completely under the control of the army. A curfew is in effect from 10 pm every night. According to news from Sofia, the Bulgarian border has been closed since Tuesday afternoon. (Reuters telegram from the 22nd)

Budapest: According to news here, last night the Romanian army and five hundred Iron Guard members engaged in a long and fierce battle in the center of the Romanian capital. Conflicts also occurred in other provincial cities, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Dozens of people were injured in the battle in the Romanian capital, and two Iron Guard members were killed. Two tanks and light machine guns participated in the battle. It is rumored that the Communist Party also participated in the battle. The battle was caused by the assassination of a German soldier by a Greek naturalized Romanian citizen on Monday. It is said that the Iron Guard launched a demonstration and rebelled when General Antonescu planned to separate them from the Volunteer Gendarmerie Corps. At the same time, the elite special guards surrounded the palace of young King Michael, the headquarters of the government ministries, and the German military delegation. The gendarmerie has occupied 87 industrial plants in Bucharest. Since the Romanian army and 500 Iron Guard members had a fierce battle last night, they have cleared the Iron Guard's police station. The Romanian army also occupied the Bucharest post office and took over all police forces. (International Telegraph from the 22nd)

The British say they are willing to spend their last penny to achieve victory, and given the current situation, they seem very confident.

In the first year of the war, Britain spent an average of £5.3 million per day on war expenses. However, this was just the initial figure, and it has now increased to £10 million per day. Anyone familiar with wartime finance can imagine that in the next twelve months, the daily war expenses will reach a staggering £12.5 million.

Britain's current financial situation is different from that of the last European war. First, in the last European war, Britain's national debt was only £1 billion, but now it has reached £10 billion. Second, Britain needs at least £3.5 billion in war expenses each year. Comparing Britain and the United States, in 1940, the United States' expenditure totaled over $9.44 billion. With each pound sterling converted to four US dollars, Britain's expenditure exceeded the United States by more than $4.5 billion, demonstrating its immensity. The United States has a population of 131 million, while Britain has only 48 million. For such a small number of people to contribute such a huge amount of money will be an unprecedented record in the history of taxation.

However, in reality, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Kingsley Wood, is not asking the people to contribute this sum in full. In terms of taxation, a married man with an annual income of £1,000 only needs to pay a strong £253 in income tax. Buying a set of clothes incurs a 12% tax, and buying a diamond ring or any luxury item incurs a strong 33% tax. The total amount of these taxes is only £1.5 billion, which is far from the amount needed for expenditure.

Of course, the British have other methods of raising funds. In total, within a year, the British people have raised £1.14 billion for the government through savings and subscriptions to public bonds, and £500 million has been raised through the sale of gold securities. However, Britain's expenditure still falls short by £360 million.

How will this shortfall be financed? Will it cause inflation? If Britain cannot obtain loans from the United States, will it be defeated? Will Britain follow Germany's policy of draining the pond to catch all the fish and continue to struggle? At this moment, no one dares to say for sure, but British economic experts are clearly willing to try all three methods soon.

Inflation has already been implemented to some extent, but its nature is not very serious. According to statistics, the funds raised purely through inflation amount to only £300 million. As for borrowing from the United States, British officials have always been cautious. They say that this is a legislative issue for the United States to decide. They acknowledge the need for American loans. Each time a German plane drops another bomb on Britain, and each time a German submarine launches another torpedo at Britain, the importance of American aid to Britain increases accordingly. Of the £800 million that the United States can lend to Britain, £500 million has already been used to buy British military supplies, and the war is still just beginning. The British government and public are now waiting for the United States to aid Britain through legal procedures, while also seeking other financial resources within the country.

When Britain is in financial difficulty, it often mentions that Germany's situation is far worse than Britain's, as a form of self-consolation. They estimate that Germany's war expenses require 4 billion marks per month, and the country's debt has reached 120 billion marks, with the debt increasing by an average of 25 billion marks per year. Germany previously had new markets for various industrial products in 1914, 1918, and 1933 to offset import payments, but now there are no new sources of wealth to draw upon, and the economic system of National Socialism is bound to reach its end.

While Britain is aware of Germany's weaknesses, it also acknowledges that Germany has aspects that can be learned from. For example, Germany increases production, strictly limits the consumption of daily necessities, and encourages people to return their savings to the state.

Britain does not have this system, and only relies on the voluntary savings of its citizens to achieve the same goal. Since the outbreak of the war, Britain has tried to reduce the production and sales of luxury goods, and has advised people to purchase goods to the minimum extent possible, so that the remainder can be contributed to the government. However, this method has not yet taken effect. The more money the workers in the arms factories earn, the greater their purchasing power. Although the middle class is cooperating closely with the government, the overall consumption of the country has not decreased significantly compared to peacetime. According to the statistics of an economic expert, it has only decreased by 5%.

This abnormal state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue and must be remedied with new methods. Therefore, in the future, taxes may continue to be increased, and some people advocate compulsory restrictions on consumption. Now that the American securities owned by wealthy Britons have been forcibly handed over to the government, the general public should also contribute a portion of their savings to the government. In the future, the goods in stores will no longer be as complete as they were last year. "More saving, less consumption" should be the creed of the British people in 1941.

### The Soviet Union's Diplomatic Victories: Germany's Plan to Invade Greece Via Bulgaria, Abandoned Due to Soviet Opposition

New York: Diplomatic circles reported yesterday that Germany had originally obtained Bulgaria's permission to advance into Greece. Germany was forced to abandon this plan because it wanted to win the Soviet Union's signature on the Soviet-German economic agreement this month. According to these sources, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov held a secret meeting in Germany on January 6. The Bulgarian Prime Minister went to Germany for medical treatment. It is understood that Ribbentrop had obtained the Bulgarian Prime Minister's permission for German troops to pass through Bulgaria to Greece, but only with the consent of Southern countries and the Soviet Union. At that time, the German Foreign Minister guaranteed that he could "prepare everything." According to diplomatic sources, the Soviet Union strongly opposed this, because it firmly believed that no powerful foreign troops should exist in Bulgaria. The Soviet Union had long regarded Bulgaria as its only route to the Dardanelles. In order to induce the Soviet Union to sign a new trade agreement, Germany had to pay the price and cancel the Bulgarian plan. The Bulgarian government received the German agreement terms on January 11, which is evident from the Bulgarian Prime Minister's speech on January 12, which was welcomed by both Turkey and Greece. The sources also said that this is why the Soviet official TASS agency denied that the Soviet Union had agreed to German troops passing through Bulgaria. TASS's denial clearly tells the world that the Soviet Union still has a very important interest in the Balkans and allows it in Bulgaria. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Japan Is Encountering a Serious Period; The House of Representatives Will Discuss Next Year's Budget

Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Konoe said in a speech to the Diet yesterday that Japan is encountering its most serious period. Domestically, we need to build a complete national defense mechanism. We must move forward according to our destiny and take appropriate measures to deal with the current international situation. Japan's participation in the Tripartite Pact is aimed at ensuring world peace and stabilizing Greater East Asia. Finally, Konoe called on all Japanese people to endure temporary hardships in order to realize Japan's goals. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo: After the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister issued declarations in the Diet yesterday, the House of Representatives focused on discussing a resolution to consolidate the wartime organization this afternoon and unanimously passed it. However, the debate on government policies, which was intended as a prelude to the discussion of next year's budget tomorrow, was not carried out. According to the resolution, which was approved by Diet members yesterday and submitted to the plenary session of the House of Representatives today, it reads: "In view of the increasingly tense international situation, and our country's pursuit of maintaining world peace, we are determined to destroy all attempts to infringe upon our sphere of life. This situation requires us to consolidate our wartime organization as soon as possible. Therefore, it is resolved that all government policies and administrative plans should be focused on achieving this goal, and the Diet should strive to support the government so that the whole country can move forward bravely to cope with the emergency situation." (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo: "Asahi Shimbun" reported today that the Lower House has decided to abandon general questioning, which is an unprecedented move in the 50-year history of the Diet. The Lower House's abandonment of questioning indicates unconditional support for the government, to help the government overcome unprecedented difficulties. However, the real reason for this move is the pressure from the government's so-called "new national structure." This new movement, which tends towards the system of totalitarian states, has led to the demise of political parties last year. It also stated that the government, in order to express its appreciation for the cooperation of the Lower House, will not submit the election bill or other bills to the House for review, and will try to pass the budget as soon as possible. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo: Japanese Navy Minister Oikawa gave a speech in the Diet yesterday, reporting on the Navy's war situation and saying that the Navy is now preparing to cope with drastic changes in the world situation. Army Minister Tojo also followed Foreign Minister Matsuoka in describing the military situation in China in the Diet. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo: Japanese Finance Minister gave a speech to the Diet yesterday, saying that the country's finances must adapt to the needs of national defense. The previous year's finances were initially smooth, but were frustrated by the development of the international situation. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

### China's Conscription System Is More Perfect Than Before; Sufficient Reserves, Reduced Conscription Quota; New System Holds Four Lotteries Each Year

Chongqing: It is appropriate to declare here today that China's conscription system has undergone considerable changes after four years of experience. The original system has been improved, and it is believed that the new system can reduce the difficulties felt by the people on the one hand. The original lottery for enlistment was held monthly, but it has now been changed to be held four times a year in March, June, September, and December. Military authorities say that China has sufficient reserves, so even if the conscription quota is reduced, it will not affect the replenishment process. At the same time, people who volunteer for enlistment are also encouraged, as in the past. The treatment received by new recruits and their families is also better than in the past. Farmers and professionals are exempt from military service. They raise funds for this purpose. Farmers donate rice and other food in place of cash, while professionals and craftsmen donate cash. Half of the funds and rice donated are supplied to the families of new recruits to avoid them being left unattended, and the other half is used for uniforms and bedding for new recruits. Special attention is now being paid to preventing those who evade military service by bribery or other illegal means, so the authorities feel that the operation of the system is now more effective than before.

### Yunnan-Burma Railway Begins Construction

Chongqing: According to reliable sources here, the Chinese authorities have reached an agreement with the special envoys of the Burmese government, who have been staying in Chongqing for several weeks, on a plan to build several important transportation lines between China, Burma, and India. The plan includes (1) the construction of the planned Yunnan-Burma Railway, from Dali to Lashio; (2) the opening of the highway from China to India; and (3) the establishment of China-India aviation. In addition, the Burmese envoys also discussed important commercial matters with the Chinese government. It is reported that the Chinese government has already begun construction of the Dali to Kunming section of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, which accounts for one-third of the entire line. Dali is located in northwestern Yunnan and is a famous production area of marble. The section of the Yunnan-Burma Railway from Dali to Lashio crosses the Mekong River and the Nu River, with many mountains, and construction will be quite difficult. The railway is roughly parallel to the Yunnan-Burma Highway. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)

### Taxpaying Foreigners Held a Meeting Today; Chinese and Foreign Citizens All Attach Importance; The Outcome of the Tax Increase Plan Relates to the Burden on Citizens; The Municipal Council Again Explained the Actual Situation of Revenue and Expenditure Yesterday

The Public Concession Municipal Council, due to financial difficulties, large and small, convened a special meeting of taxpaying foreigners to request the passage of increased taxes and license fees. The meeting was scheduled to be held today at 2:30 PM on the grandstand of the Racecourse. The chairman of the meeting has been internally designated as Mr. Hill, the Danish Consul-General and Senior Consul in Shanghai. The agenda is: (1) Election of the Secretary of the Meeting; (2) Request for passage of increases in (A) land tax; (B) a 40% surcharge on the General Municipal Rate; (C) a 40% surcharge on the Special Property Rate; (3) Request for authorization for the Municipal Council to increase various license fees from January 1st until the next Taxpayers' Annual Meeting. However, Japanese residents have proposed a motion to overturn the entire plan. British and American residents seem to support the Municipal Council's tax increase. Therefore, not only will there be fierce debate at the meeting, but it has also been decided that a final vote will be taken by all taxpaying foreigners by a show of hands.

Re-Publication of Revenue and Expenditure Overview

The Municipal Council re-published an overview of revenue and expenditure, saying, "The Special Meeting of Taxpaying Foreigners is about to be held. The revenue, expenditure, and deficit situation of the Council have been explained in detail in previous articles. Now, we will re-select the main points to inform all taxpayers.

Deficit Situation

The Council's regular expenditure last year exceeded the budget by 7.8 million yuan. Regular revenue increased by 4.6 million yuan compared to the projected amount. The total annual deficit is estimated to be around 8.773 million yuan (the original budget listed more than 5.573 million yuan). In December last year, the issuance of cost-of-living allowances to all employees was approved, requiring 1 million yuan per month, of which 714,000 yuan was added to Chinese employees who did not have employment contracts. If the Council's revenue and expenditure situation continues like this, the deficit for this year will be 20 million yuan. If the tax increase is delayed until April, the amount of the increase should be around 60% instead of 40%.

Revenue from Tax Increase

If the general rate and land rate are collected at 1%, 400,000 yuan can be obtained annually. Collected at the current rate of 27%, 37.8 million yuan can be obtained annually. If the surcharge is increased by 40%, the annual revenue is expected to increase by 15.12 million yuan. In addition, after the revision of various license fees, it is expected to increase revenue by 3.5 million yuan annually. After deducting these two items to offset the estimated deficit, there is a shortfall of 1.4 million yuan, which is planned to be made up by increasing the assessed value of owner-occupied houses.

Expected Fierce Debate

The English-language North China Daily News said, "The Special Meeting of Taxpaying Foreigners in the Public Concession is scheduled to be held on the 23rd (today) afternoon at the Race Club. The Municipal Council must increase tax revenue by 20 million yuan to meet its financial needs for 1941. However, taxpaying Japanese expect the Municipal Council to be more frugal and to revise the current tax system of the Public Concession. Therefore, the meeting will clearly have the most intense debate in the history of the Public Concession. In addition to the important proposals submitted to taxpayers for discussion at the meeting, it is expected that other important changes that may be proposed at the Taxpayers' Annual Meeting in April can be foreseen, such as taxpaying Japanese planning to change the election system, and even amend the Land Regulations, etc."

Japanese Amendment of the Tax System

What will be discussed at the meeting is the "Resolution No. [Blank]" proposed by Mr. Catty and seconded by Mr. Carly, which requests taxpayers to approve a 40% surcharge on land tax, a 27% municipal general rate, a 24% special rate, and the continued increase in license fees proposed by the Municipal Council's Economic Committee. Taxpaying Japanese oppose this proposal and have passed an amendment requesting the Municipal Council to "be more frugal and fundamentally study the possibility of revising the current tax system in order to apply a more equitable system." It is expected that many taxpayers from other countries will support the Japanese amendment.

Borrowing to Make Up the Deficit Is a Stopgap

Although the amendment advocates that the Municipal Council make up the estimated shortfall of less than 20 million yuan by borrowing, pending the revision of the tax system, some people believe that this method is quite difficult, because the Municipal Council's financial situation requires immediate and practical steps. British taxpayers have also passed an amendment advocating the temporary increase of a 40% surcharge on owner-occupied houses from January 1st of this year, pending a new and accurate assessment. The surcharge on rented properties is limited to 40% of the 1937 assessment.

### All Industries Handle Year-End Closing; Business as Usual on the 26th

The Shanghai Silver and Money Trade Association issued a public notice yesterday: "It is found that January 26th is the year-end closing date for the 29th year, which happens to be a Sunday holiday. For the convenience of collection and remittance of various industries, members of the two trade associations will conduct business as usual on that day. Furthermore, business will be conducted as usual on Saturday afternoon, the 25th. This is a special notice. Attached note: Member banks of the Banking Association, including the Bank of East Asia, the Overseas Chinese Bank, the Zhongxing Bank, and the Guangdong Bank, will still take a holiday as usual." At the same time, each bank and company will issue its own public notice to inform the public.

Market Closure Dates

Due to the approach of the year-end closing period, various industry markets have decided to close the market during the year-end closing period to handle annual accounting. Reporters from the New Voice News Agency inquired about the market conditions of various industries yesterday: (1) The money market's discount interest rate will be opened until the 25th, and the market will open on January 31st; (2) The foreign exchange black market will be closed from the afternoon of the 25th, and the market will open on the 30th; (3) The public bond gray market will be closed from the afternoon of the 22nd, and the market will open on January 31st; (4) After the trading on the morning of the 22nd, the yarn and cotton gray market will handle settlement and close the market, and the market will open on January 31st; (5) The gold black market is scheduled to close from the afternoon of the 25th; (6) The miscellaneous grains market will be closed on the 22nd, and the bean and rice market will be closed on the 23rd.

Company Dynamics

In addition to handling the year-end closing, all money shops must completely repay all credit transactions and overdrafts before New Year's Eve, and return the transaction books, in accordance with past customs. After the year-end closing period, transaction books will be sent separately for transactions. However, the deposit interest of various factories, companies, and firms will be settled up to January 20th. The interest on deposits and debts of various banks will be calculated as usual. It is heard that the banks will open on January 30th, and the money shops will open on January 31st (the fifth day of the Lunar New Year) due to the connection with the God of Wealth. There will be six new money shops opening, one closing, and one suspending its listing.

### US Embassy Military Attaché Comes to Shanghai on Official Business

The English-language North China Daily News said that Lieutenant Colonel Clayton, the Naval Attaché of the US Embassy in Chongqing, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 21st) aboard the President Taft on official business. In addition, Captain Julian, the Air Force Attaché of the US Embassy in Tokyo, also returned to Tokyo via Shanghai after returning from Manila aboard the ship.

### Gold Bars Seized on the Shengjing Wheel Were Not Transferred

After the "Central Reserve Bank" of the puppet regime opened a branch in Shanghai, it was rumored the day before yesterday that the Jianghai Customs had transferred 500,000 yuan in gold bars seized and confiscated on the Shengjing Wheel to the "Bank", and it was also rumored that all goods and fines confiscated by the Jianghai Customs thereafter would be transferred to the Bank. According to the English-language North China Daily News, Customs Commissioner Raufford said yesterday that this news is not true and that the Customs has not transferred the gold bars and other confiscated smuggled goods and fines to the Bank.

### Prices Still Not Stabilized, Utilities Again to Increase, British Tram Fares Raised Again

Utility prices in this city have risen time and again since the war, exceeding pre-war levels by several times. The general public is nearly overwhelmed by the burden. However, various utility companies invariably use the excuse of foreign exchange shortages and soaring expenses, completely disregarding the interests of the public. This is truly distressing.

Public Concession - Increased Electricity Prices

Yesterday, the Shanghai Power Company of the Public Concession announced another price increase starting February 1st. The electricity surcharge will increase to 180.97%, while ordinary electricity for power, heating, cooking, and water heating will increase by 276.37%. These new prices have been approved by the Municipal Council.

French Concession Water and Electricity - Third Price Increase

Also yesterday, the French Tramway and Electricity Company announced that, with the approval of the French Municipal Council, it will implement its third price increase starting on the 26th of this month. Electricity will increase from 97% to 103%, electricity for heating and motors from 97% to 140%, and tap water from 30% to 49%. The new price list for trams, trolleybuses, and buses will be posted on all vehicles on the 26th of this month.

British Tram - Price Increase Approved

As for the trams in the Public Concession, the Municipal Council has also approved a 35% increase on current fares, effective January 25th. Citizens of this city, whose incomes have not increased in proportion to the soaring prices, express deep regret over the repeated price increases by the two concession power companies and hope that the authorities will understand the difficult times and consider the matter carefully.

### British Ships Sailing to the Far East Requisitioned, Shanghai-England Line Suspended, Empress Ships All Requisitioned for Military Use

Since the declaration of war between Britain and Germany, British ships on the Europe-Asia route have gradually decreased. The British India Steam Navigation Company in this city is the largest organization in the British shipping industry in the Far East. The Shanghai-London line, which originally had three ships per month, has had no sailings from Shanghai to England for more than two months. Only the India and Australia lines are still maintained as usual, but the number of ships has also decreased.

The Ellora (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai from Bombay, India, loaded with a large quantity of cotton, over 80,000 pieces. It is said that the ship has also been requisitioned by the British Navy. Therefore, it is scheduled to return to India from Shanghai tomorrow (24th). After unloading its cargo in Calcutta, it will be handed over to the British Navy for deployment. Regular ships on the Shanghai-London route have been suspended. Irregular ships include cargo ships from the Blue Funnel Line. The Eurasia Line of the Jardine Matheson & Co. has also been greatly reduced. It is said that most of the Norwegian ships managed by the company have been requisitioned by the British Navy. Now a few ships are maintaining the Pacific route. As for the Canadian Pacific mail ships on the Pacific route, the British China Navigation Company can be said to be the sole operator. The company has four Empress mail ships, which are large and luxuriously equipped, and are famous mail ships on the Pacific route. They have now all been requisitioned for military use. According to the company, there are no ships available temporarily, and ships may be available in April. Another source says that the Blue Funnel Line plans to send ships to the Shanghai-Canada route and is currently planning.

### Japanese Planes Intend to Bomb Mission Property in Jiangxi Province

The North-China Daily News reports that, according to a letter from a foreign priest of the church in Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, Japanese planes have been constantly flying to the area for bombing. Many church buildings have also been deliberately bombed and destroyed. However, church work continues as usual. Recently, Japanese planes intentionally bombed church property. The letter reports two unfortunate incidents, which are excerpted below. Due to frequent air raid alarms and heavy bombing, we deeply feel that the war has occurred. Since the church building was bombed, we feel that the war is already in progress. On the 15th of last month, the church's orphanage and the residence of the nuns were suddenly bombed by three Japanese seaplanes, and machine-gunned. There are a total of 500 orphans and priests in the institute, one of whom has been killed and another injured.

### Successor to Legal Advisor of French Municipal Council to be Determined

Since the assassination of Mr. Doug, legal advisor of the French Municipal Council and chairman of the French Concession Rent Committee, all matters related to the rent investigation in the French Concession have been suspended. In December of last year, the committee drafted regulations to crack down on housing speculation and submitted them to the French Consul-General for review and implementation. As the chairman of the Rent Committee has not yet been selected, all procedures could not be completed. Yesterday, a spokesman for the French Municipal Council said that Mr. Doug's vacancy has not yet been filled, and added that the various affairs of the legal department of the Municipal Council are progressing smoothly. A candidate will be determined in the near future.

### "January 28th" Memorial Day - French Police Do Not Take Holiday

The French Police Force originally followed the custom of taking three days off during the Spring Festival to suspend work. The Spring Festival this year will be on holiday as usual. However, on the "January 28th" Memorial Day, although it is during the holidays, the French Police Force must still work, and all police officers must also serve as usual to strengthen police force and ensure security.

### Municipal Council Board of Directors Passes Adjustment of Treatment for Chinese Staff, Appointment Letters Issued to Chinese Professionals, Pensions Limited to Those Holding Appointment Letters

The "Research Staff Service Conditions" subcommittee of the Municipal Council's Economic Committee has been in place for four months. Its task is to study whether there are any changes that can be made to the current staff service conditions. After review, a report has been prepared and submitted to the Council Board of Directors for approval at the regular meeting on the 22nd of this month. The recommendations in the report include the following:

Chinese Staff - Adjust Treatment

(1) Please have the Classification Committee consider (A) adjusting the year-end bonus and funeral expenses for Chinese staff holding appointment letters, (B) expanding the medical benefits enjoyed by senior Chinese staff who do not hold appointment letters, and (C) issuing appointment letters to more Chinese staff with specialized or technical qualifications. (2) The Chinese Staff Association's request to extend the pension plan to all Chinese staff is not approved. Currently, the above plan is limited to Chinese staff holding appointment letters.

Chinese Clerks Set Up - Extra Grade

(3) According to the current method, the salary of a first-class Chinese clerk can automatically increase from 92 yuan to 207 yuan, which is too far apart. This committee agrees to add an extra grade with a salary of 150 yuan. After that, when promoted from the extra grade to the top grade, it should be the same as the current promotion from the third grade to the second grade and from the second grade to the first grade. The promotion shall be effective only after being recommended by the superior.

Savings Plan - Also Changed

(4) Chinese field staff with a salary of 50 yuan or more may freely join the savings plan. (5) For staff employed by the Municipal Council in the future, their savings must be deposited for five years before they can enjoy the Municipal Council's subsidy when they terminate their employment. (6) In the future, staff who resign after accumulating savings for more than six years and whose total deposits are not guaranteed by any exchange subsidies should be given a cash subsidy by the Municipal Council when the savings are to be withdrawn to supplement them. This subsidy is calculated as a percentage, equal to the amount of their living expenses subsidy on the date of their resignation. (7) The above current subsidy does not apply to retired staff prior to the implementation of this method. In the future, when the exchange rate is 6 pence in British gold, 0.61642 in US dollars, or 0.5733 in Japanese yen, this subsidy will be considered in the east line. (8) The Classification Committee should consider approving the special leave plan for senior Chinese staff.

### Panama Ship Detained, Recently Sailed to Taiwan, Norwegian Shipowner Not Yet Released, Portuguese Ship Anjo Also Detained

Since the Japanese naval authorities announced the expansion of the coastal blockade to the Guangdong-South China Sea area, foreign merchant ships sailing to coastal ports have been repeatedly intercepted and detained. According to shipping industry news yesterday, the Panama-registered giant cargo ship Marion has recently been detained by Japanese warships encountered en route. All Chinese crew members have been released, but the ship and the Norwegian shipowner have been forced to sail to Taiwan. The Norwegian Consulate General has been reported and has filed a protest with the Japanese through the Norwegian Consul in Hong Kong. The Portuguese ship Anjo (S.S. Anjo) is also currently being detained by the Japanese.

### Two Obstacles Removed on Great West Road, But Barbed Wire Erected Again at End of Rue Tenant de la Tour

The barbed wire obstacles set up by the Japanese in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area have been moved recently. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the blockade obstacles near Hong En Hospital on Great West Road and at the intersection of Rue Amiral Courbet and Great West Road were removed by Japanese soldiers on the 21st of this month, making it easier for pedestrians and vehicles to enter and exit. However, a barbed wire fence has been erected near the intersection of Rue Tenant de la Tour and Hai Ge Road, and vehicles and pedestrians must detour through the gap to pass. Rickshaws are not allowed to pass and must detour elsewhere. The densely arranged barbed wire is newly made, or will be placed for a long time, blocking traffic.

### Gold Travels to Chongqing, Record of Interview with Chairman Chiang

Gold, the editor of the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, recently traveled to Chongqing and wrote an account of his interview with Chairman Chiang. The original text is omitted. Now there is one person who has the absolute loyalty and obedience of one-quarter of the world's people, namely Chairman Chiang, the leader of Free China. After the Chinese army suffered through a war and a half, Japan finally realized that peace could only be achieved with the consent of Chairman Chiang. The reporter has met Chairman Chiang several times, and now he has met someone falsely called a "warlord dictator," and sees his breadth of mind, which is progressing with each day, and has become a model of democracy and a great man.

Deeper Belief in Final Victory

Everyone who has met with Chairman Chiang unanimously believes in the final victory of an independent China and that Chairman Chiang is crucial to building China along the lines of free democracy. His attitude is firm, and his belief is deeper than ever before. Chairman Chiang has the demeanor of an ancient gentleman, but reveals his inner vitality and decisiveness everywhere. He met the reporter in the living room of his private residence, which had been repeatedly bombed but had not been hit, wearing a simple khaki military uniform, with sharp and kind eyes, and a smile on his face. He warmly shook hands and invited the reporter to sit down upon entering the hall.

Earnestly Concerned About the People of Shanghai

Chairman Chiang first inquired anxiously about the people and situation of the "isolated island" of Shanghai. The reporter replied that Shanghai was very different from Chongqing. Chairman Chiang continued: "We are all very grateful for the friendly attitude expressed by American commercial publications and American expatriates in China. We are aware that you are encountering difficulties because of your independent position, and we feel that you have shown great courage in upholding what you believe is just, and publishing news and editorials without fear of violence." Chairman Chiang then inquired about the welfare of other American expatriates who were "wanted," saying that rumors had it that one American expatriate was living in Hongkou. The reporter told him that this was not the case. Chairman Chiang expressed satisfaction and instructed the reporter to ask the American expatriate to take care of himself. Chairman Chiang was deeply concerned about the people of Shanghai, saying that he was convinced that the people of Shanghai and other parts of the country were all deeply patriotic and hoped that the reporter would convey to the people the belief that China had already endured the most suffering and was about to see better times.

China has Entered the Democratic Camp

Chairman Chiang then discussed the future of China after the war and other broad issues. From Chairman Chiang down, all are deeply convinced that China will win the war, and there is no doubt that Japan will ultimately be destroyed after suffering a bitter war with China. Some people ask whether China's development will be hindered by "dictatorship," but they do not know that Chairman Chiang is strongly opposed to totalitarianism. It is said that "the Chinese people are inherently democratic, China has entered the democratic camp, China had already chosen this path before the war, and will insist on it until the end of the war, and will continue to follow the democratic path in the future."

American Ambassador Johnson Expresses his Views

Regarding this point, the reporter has consulted with various people and obtained various answers. For example, American Ambassador Johnson said, "China is in the midst of a revolution and has suddenly encountered war. However, when the war ends, the continuation of the revolutionary trend is inevitable. Looking at the overall event from a historical perspective, he feels that outsiders are impatient with China because it does not quickly seek solutions that satisfy the psychology of Westerners! China must find its own path and gradually move forward."

Constitution Implemented After the War Ends

The reporter also asked Chairman Chiang whether the National Political Council was a very important signpost on the path to democracy in the future. He replied that this was a temporary measure. After the war ends, we will fully implement the new constitution of free democracy and follow the precedents of the United States and other major democracies to accommodate multiple parties to replace the current one-party system. A parliament will be convened, and a general election will be held to implement the entire democratic system. The United States is the greatest democratic country, and China will follow the example of the United States to the greatest extent possible.

### Pawnshops Should be Insured According to Capital

The pawnshop industry can regulate the finances of ordinary people, increase local production, and is closely related to social welfare. However, pawnshops in various places are mostly privately run, with short terms and high profits, and are rife with abuses. They may even stop operating at will, affecting social stability. In view of this, the Ministry of the Interior has drafted and promulgated management measures. The measures stipulate that all pawnshops should be insured with an insurance company according to the total amount of capital within one month after opening. Those who violate the regulations may be ordered by the provincial and municipal governments to suspend their business, except for those who have obtained approval from the provincial and municipal governments due to traffic congestion. If pawnshops encounter losses of pawned items due to war, robbery, or water and fire disasters, they should report to the competent authorities and the local chamber of commerce within 24 hours after the incident to verify and seal the remaining items. Those who have insured with an insurance company must notify the insurance company to send personnel to inspect and seal the items together. Those with recognizable serial numbers should be redeemed as before. Those without verifiable serial numbers should be valued and sold, and the original pawned households should be paid at half price according to the face value of the pawn tickets, and 60% of the face value should be compensated. If the foregoing provisions are violated, in addition to a fine of more than 500 yuan and less than 1,000 yuan, they will still be ordered to handle the matter in accordance with the previous provisions.

### Starting From Oneself

— Shen Daling

Shen Daling lectured on "Starting From Oneself" at the eighth session of the Five Teachings Sutra Meeting, which was attended by followers of all five religions.

The Doctrine of the Mean in the Book of Rites says that sincerity is self-completing, and the Way is self-led. The Great Learning speaks of not deceiving oneself, and speaking of self-illumination. Only after possessing something within oneself can one demand it of others; only after not possessing something within oneself can one criticize it in others. The Analects say, "I have not yet seen anyone who can see his own faults and inwardly accuse himself." Benevolence originates from oneself, and one should be ashamed of one's actions. Ancient scholars cultivated themselves, cultivating themselves with reverence, cultivating themselves to bring peace to others, and cultivating themselves to bring peace to the common people. The gentleman seeks within himself. Mencius said that if one examines oneself and does not find sincerity, one should be uneasy; if one examines oneself and finds sincerity, there is no misfortune or blessing that one does not seek from oneself, quoting the poem "Seek for yourself many blessings," and quoting the Tai Jia "One who makes his own evil cannot live." He also said that having these four beginnings (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom) and thinking oneself capable is to harm oneself. If one's actions are not successful, one should always examine oneself. People must first insult themselves before others insult them; a family must first destroy itself before others destroy it; a country must first attack itself before others attack it. One who abandons himself cannot be reasoned with, and one who isolates himself cannot be worked with. Speaking contrary to propriety and righteousness is called abandoning oneself; being unable to abide in benevolence and follow righteousness is called discarding oneself. The gentleman delves deeply into the Way, desiring to attain it for himself. The gentleman must reflect on himself. Confucian books emphasize oneself with meticulous and detailed explanations.

Lao Tzu, in chapter thirty-three, says that one who knows himself is enlightened, and one who overcomes himself is strong. Zhuang Tzu's Treatise on Equalizing Things says that knowing oneself is knowing. In the Human World, the ultimate person of ancient times first existed within himself and then existed within others. If even the virtue of Ji Zi is insufficient to reflect on oneself, then in the Great Ancestral Master, adapting to others but not adapting oneself, those who cannot untangle themselves are bound by things.

Buddhist scriptures speak of self-nature, self-liberation, self-realization, and self-practice for the transformation of others, also known as self-benefit and benefiting others. All dharmas have unchanging natures, called self-nature. Self-liberation means first liberating oneself, crossing the sea of life and death to reach the shore of Nirvana. The ultimate truth, not obtained from others but self-realized, is called self-realization. Seeking Bodhi above is self-benefit, and transforming sentient beings below is benefiting others. The practices of Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas are only for self-benefit, while the practices of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are for both self-benefit and benefiting others. This path, like Confucianism, also emphasizes oneself.

The Old Testament of Christianity, Jeremiah chapter forty-eight, Moab is punished for being arrogant and conceited. Chapter forty-nine, Edom is punished for being deceived by the pride of his heart. Lamentations of Jeremiah, why do the living complain when punished for their sins? We should deeply examine our own actions. Ezekiel chapter eighteen, the good deeds of the righteous will return to themselves, and the evil deeds of the wicked will also return to themselves. Hosea chapter ten, sow righteousness for yourselves, and you will reap love. Zephaniah chapter three, but you rise early and corrupt yourselves in everything. Haggai chapter one, consider your own ways.

The Quran says, "Now We have shown the warning, may they reflect on themselves." Evil people do not reflect on their own faults. They are willing to abandon themselves; this is truly a sin of their own making. Why do you not reflect on yourselves? The calamity that the rebellious bring upon themselves will surely come. Those who do good benefit themselves, and those who do evil harm themselves. Your calamities are caused by your own actions, harming yourselves and your families. If calamities befall you, it is because you have brought them upon yourselves. The righteous will surely have good rewards; seek light for yourselves. They truly take the blame upon themselves, performing almsgiving widely for themselves; this is the highest good. Those who are stingy with themselves will surely prosper later. Each person knows what they are doing. This, like Christianity, also emphasizes oneself.

Therefore, it is most important for everyone to know themselves. On the one hand, encouraging oneself is active, and on the other hand, warning oneself is passive. I hope to encourage all of you with the shared emphasis on oneself in the five religions.

### ### Yue Opera Queen Yao Shuijuan Pelted with Manure, Real Estate Merchant Zhou Songyun Also Attacked

News from the society: Yao Shuijuan, the Yue Opera queen currently performing at the Cathay Theatre, was suddenly pelted with manure when she exited the Zhejiang East Grand Theatre on Beijing Road, Songjia Lane, after finishing a performance the day before. The normally fragrant and powdered Yao Shuijuan was instantly covered in yellow liquid, unrecognizable. Furthermore, Zhou Yunsong, a local fellow villager of 72 years old and a real estate merchant residing at No. 13, Lane 57, Panxin Road, French Concession, was going out on business at 2 PM on the 18th of this month when, just as he stepped out of his front door, he was unexpectedly met by Jin Rongfa (25 years old), a Shanghai native and typist at the French Public Works Bureau residing at No. 1 next door, who threw a bag of excrement at his face. His head, face, and hat were completely covered in urine and feces, and the stench was unbearable. Jin, seeing that he had achieved his goal, immediately turned and fled. Zhou, due to his old age and weakness, was unable to chase him and returned home to wash himself. Afterwards, he reported the incident to the French police station, requesting an investigation and arrest. Jin avoided returning home after the incident until the afternoon of the day before, when he secretly returned and was discovered by French police detective Xia Songhai, who arrested Jin. During interrogation, Jin admitted to throwing manure out of spite. The police chief ordered Jin to be detained pending further investigation. It is rumored that Jin's family has hired someone to mediate, apologize, and seek reconciliation with Zhou.

### ### Shaoxing Red Rice Wine Selling Well

The Chen Shao red rice wine produced by the Shaoxing Red Rice Winery has long been famous for its mellow and fragrant taste, surpassing the Tai Shang Hua Diao wine, while being more affordable. Each fully packaged one-jin bottle is only sold for seven yuan and fifty cents, making it quite suitable for banquets and gifts. The distribution office is located at Shenyu Lane, Huacheng Road, French Concession. Telephone number: 86622.

### ### Letter

To the Editor,

I recently read an article in your newspaper about the telephone company, and the part about Chunrong is inconsistent with the facts. Chunrong, although in the electrical materials business, is not a repairman for the telephone company. This case is completely unrelated. However, because he purchased lead-covered telephone wire from Xiangtai Foreign Firm two years ago and still has some stock for sale, a customer with the surname Xu caused a slight suspicion. However, after investigation by the Central Police Station, it was clarified and he was not prosecuted. He was legally released by the Shanghai First Special District Local Court. The report in your newspaper is likely based on inaccurate rumors. This concerns Chunrong's reputation, so I cannot remain silent. Therefore, I am writing to request that your newspaper promptly correct the record as soon as possible. Respectfully yours, Gao Chunrong, January 22nd.

### ### Finance: Hong Kong Side Backfills Sterling

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. In the unofficial English and American exchange markets, the fluctuations were minor due to inconsistent actions among operators, with a slight tendency towards tightening. There were many rumors in the market, such as news that the Roosevelt conference had mentioned the freezing of Axis funds, and news that Anglo-Japanese relations were strained. All of these were bearish factors. Speculators in the market sold off, but suddenly the Hong Kong side came to backfill shorts (some say they sold gold). They strongly bought sterling, and some Western brokers organized hedge funds to absorb U.S. dollars, competing with other speculators. It was heard that brokerage firms had cheaply settled February U.S. dollars at 5.40625 yuan, but closing spot U.S. dollars at 5.4375 yuan were difficult to buy. As a result, English exchange was 3 pence 40625, and the U.S. exchange was 5.40625 yuan, with little change from the previous day. The same was true for futures.

Both English and American Currencies Unchanged

Early in the morning, London's large lots, both near and forward, fell by 0.0625. New York's silver price was flat, and London's raw gold was fixed. The exchange rate of English to American was flat, and to Shanghai it increased by 0.0625. The exchange rate of American to English was tighter, and to Shanghai it decreased by one point. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning, with English gold at 3 pence 40625 and U.S. dollars at 5.40625 yuan, the same as the previous day's close. It was heard that the market was quiet afterwards. It was estimated that foreign banks first traded this month's U.S. dollar price at 5.40625 yuan. Soon, Hong Kong Electric came to buy sterling, with Chinese and foreign firms offering this month's prices at 3 pence 40625 and 390625. The price for February was 3 pence 375. At 9:30, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was lower by 0.50. After that, there were bearish rumors in the market, and speculators sold off a large number of U.S. dollars, but at the same time, Hong Kong Electric absorbed them aggressively, so supply and demand were balanced. It was estimated that speculators, American firms, and Hong Kong Lei traded this month's U.S. dollars at 5.4375 yuan. Later, because foreign firms supplied heavily, the market became slightly tighter. It was estimated that brokers bought this month's U.S. dollars from foreign firms at 5.4375 yuan, and February U.S. dollars reached 5.40625 yuan. The noon closing was stable, and the U.S. dollar softened. As a result, spot and this month's English gold were 3 pence 40625, U.S. dollars were 5.40625 yuan, and next month's English gold was 3 pence 375, U.S. dollars were 5.375 yuan. Compared to the previous day's closing price, there were no gains or losses for English and American exchange rates, either spot or futures.

### ### Hong Kong Currency in High Demand

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the Chariot market rise and fall. English and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan each. The English gold notes remained fixed as before, and the market price stabilized. American gold notes initially rose to 18.42 yuan, but finally settled at 18.2 yuan, falling by 0.18 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes were in high demand, and the market price rose. Japanese gold notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price stabilized, remaining at 1.57 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes had slightly stronger supply, and the market price weakened, falling to 1.2 yuan in the evening market.

### ### International Situation Unfavorable for Bullishness, Gold Market Declines Again

Yesterday, the Chariot market saw a decline from high levels, with a widespread sense of fatigue. The opening price was the highest, following the previous day's rise, initially reaching 6,750 yuan. However, reports stated that the United Kingdom would withdraw its merchants residing in Japan, and it was further rumored that Japanese ships were no longer allowed to approach Singapore. The rumor that the United States would freeze Axis funds resurfaced, and there were reports of exchange dealers organizing companies to sell short, and that the Hong Kong gang was also selling short. The middle price of Dafeng, Xinfeng, Hesheng, and Hengji cash shops fell to a low of 6,610 yuan. Near noon, there was news that Xinyuan was dumping more than 4,000 taels, and the Shanghai Western gang was covering long positions, so the price rebounded, finally reaching 6,650 yuan, down 73 yuan. Based on the February U.S. dollar settlement price of 5.375 yuan, it was 6,500 yuan, an increase of 150 yuan. Total transaction volume for half a day was approximately 10,000 taels, with approximately 400 taels of spot contracts transferring from January to February. Yuxing, Yongdeng, and others offered 225 yuan, while Xinyuan alone offered to buy. For cash, Baokang sold 200 taels to Dadecheng, with the price 10 yuan lower than the futures price. There was no market in the afternoon due to Wednesday, and ornaments were also listed at 10 yuan lower, at 680 yuan. Customs gold, etc., were all flat. Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) saw enthusiastic buying, following the previous day's trend. The market opened at 9:15 and immediately rose to 6,750 yuan, 27 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Hesheng Dafeng came to sell, and Xinyuan, No. 3, also sold, which attracted attention, and followers sold off, causing the price to gradually drop by 85 yuan, returning to 6,700 yuan and then falling to 6,665 yuan. Later, Yuxing, Yongxiang, and Hefu covered shorts, and Shunyuan also bought. It was decided yesterday to reach 6,705 yuan. Eventually, due to the softening of foreign exchange and rumors of friction between England and Japan, such as Singapore banning Japanese merchant ships from entering and England withdrawing its nationals from Japan, and the US having stipulations for freezing the funds of Axis nations, market sentiment turned bearish. Hengji, Dafeng, and cash shops sold together, and prices dropped to the 6,600-yuan mark, reaching a low of 6,610 yuan. Thereafter, Xinyuan and the Shanghai West gang were active on the dips and aggressively sought to buy, pushing the price up to 6,655 yuan, and eventually closed at 6,650 yuan, down 73 yuan from the previous day. The range was 140 yuan in half a day. The cash shop's basic gold selling price was more than 10 yuan higher than the Chariot market, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current marked gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price. Transactions were done openly.

Ornament Prices Also Listed 10 Yuan Lower

The selling price of gold ornaments was 10 yuan lower per tael, with Datongheng, Xinhengheng, and others listing 680 yuan. The buying price of Xinhengheng was similar to the listed price, 30 yuan lower, it was said.

### ### Silver and Money Industry Final Settlement—Business as Usual on Sundays

This month's 26th (Sunday) is the final settlement period for the 19th year of the lunar cycle. The city's silver and money industry association has decided that, to facilitate collection and settlement for all businesses, business will be conducted as usual on Saturday afternoon the 25th and on Sunday the following day. However, the four Chinese banks, namely Huaqiao, Zhongyu, Dongya, and Guangdong, as well as all foreign commercial banks in the city, will be closed as usual.

### ### Securities: Domestic Debt Near an End; Trading Remains Active Yesterday, Market Fluctuations Large

The domestic debt market was nearing its end yesterday. From the afternoon onwards, the market closed early and will not reopen until January 31 (i.e., the fifth day of the lunar new year). Due to the previous day's drop, and the unevenness of the drop, the market situation was fluctuating greatly, with large volumes and a spread of one yuan or several jiao. The main factors affecting market sentiment were the last settlement before the new year, the settlement between bulls and bears, and the unsettled rumors about interest rates. The most notable event was that Tongkang continued to buy aggressively for several consecutive days. During the closing, there was an unexpected trend. Trading in the morning half-day remained extremely active. Tongkang first bought aggressively, continuously raising the price by 1.5 yuan. Then, as sellers continued to emerge, Xinfu, Dahua, and Xieda sold in large quantities, causing a slight pullback. Then, Tongsheng, Hengfu, Runli, and Renchang bought again, raising the price by another 0.6 to 0.7 jiao. Hongda, Dingkang, and Hu Heji then sold again, causing a pullback of about 1 yuan. The class C bond traded in and out around the 70-yuan level. The trading finally broke through. The closing price had both rises and falls due to the uneven drop the day before. Class A, B, and C bonds rose by several jiao to 1.4 yuan, while class D and E bonds fell by 0.3 to 0.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was still more than 3 million yuan. A brief summary table is provided below.

Stock trading: 400 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of 9 yuan each.

### ### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Lingers Amid Closing

The yarn market, in general, is lingering in a state of indecision. This is due to the approaching end of the lunar year, and the majority of buyers and sellers are watching and waiting, not acting, and waiting for the market to open in the spring before deciding the final outcome. However, the gold group is consistently in a long position, predicting that the upward trend will be more dominant next year, so they are still increasing their positions. As for others in the industry, half are not doing business in both high grade and low grade cottons, and half are buying. Yesterday, 380 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

At the opening of the market for high grade cotton, due to the rebound of the gold price in the afternoon of the previous day, buyers came again, and the momentum was tight. The initial price was 1,420 yuan. Shortly thereafter, it fell to 1,417 yuan. Then, as the foreign exchange market was stable and the gold market was relatively firm, it rose again to 1,423 yuan. Those who made profits along the way sold off, and it fell again to 1,408 yuan. At the same time, spot sales were quiet. In a flash, it was heard that the gold price had risen again, and buyers followed the trend up to 1,421 yuan. By 11:30 AM, it suddenly fell, and the claim that gold had fallen resulted in the high grade cotton price falling back to 1,409 yuan. The closing price was 1,411 to 1,412 yuan. The total transaction volume for half a day was 5,180 bales. The high grade cotton market had little movement. The sales volume for each group is listed separately below:

Fellow traders: 5,000
Inland: 30
Ningbo: 10
Hong Kong: 140
Total: 5,180

### ### Cotton Market: Mills Have Little Demand

The current cotton market is completely stagnant. This is because the end of the year has arrived, and everyone is busy closing their books, so transactions are quiet. The mills are also closed at the beginning and end of the year, so the demand is increasingly sluggish.

Another message is that the New York cotton market is quite soft due to the taking of profits and by selling off by the public. As a result, the closing price was more than ten points lower than the previous day's close. Indian cotton rose slightly due to speculative buying, but later fell due to public selling and the easing of the war situation. Yesterday, the forecasts were down another three rupees.

Shanghai's foreign cotton market is virtually at a standstill due to the end of the year.

### Grains: Rice Market at the Edge of the Final Settlement Period; Rice Prices Have Risen by 50 Yuan in a Year; 600,000 Bags in Stock, with 400,000 More Expected

Spot foreign rice saw sellers emerge yesterday, and the market continued to decline. Currently, there are 450,000 to 460,000 bags in stock, and more than 100,000 bags are either already arrived or expected to arrive soon, for a total of no less than 600,000 bags. Actual sales are low, and merchants are inactive. Although the big firms are holding firm, the market is still being suppressed by scattered sellers. As a result, the price is down by about 1 yuan from the previous market. The futures market has little float, and large firms are holding firm. Only a little more than 300 tons were traded yesterday. The selling prices of No. 2 Saigon and Small Bending are similar to the previous day. Only No. 1 road cargo, priced at 81.5 yuan per picul, is slightly lower due to its proximity to the spot market. New transactions saw Heyi selling more than 1,000 tons of No. 1 Saigon for March delivery at a price of 88 yuan, which was bought by trading firms. However, foreign firms sold more and absorbed less, and most people are bearish. The spot market only traded a little more than 3,000 bags due to the approaching settlement. Furthermore, as it is the last day of the major winter settlement period, most stores and merchants had already completed their business two or three days earlier, so the sales market has weakened. The overall situation shows a closing atmosphere. Those merchants with a large amount of goods on hand are still trying to sell them off due to financial constraints, but there are few outlets, and the market is chaotic. The settlement prices are estimated as follows: No. 1 Saigon foreign rice at 85 to 83 yuan, No. 2 at 80.08 to 77 yuan, No. 1 Siam, high-quality old stock, determined at 85 to 80 yuan, Fire Bending at 81.5 to 81 yuan, Small Bending at 73 to 72 yuan, Rice Tea at 68 yuan, and Broken Tip Special, ranging from 66 yuan second-grade to 57 yuan third-grade.

For thick and thin japonica rice, Changbang Yuanbai japonica is 106 to 107 yuan, Kunshan Yuanbai japonica is 104 yuan, and Huxian japonica is 102 to 103 yuan, up to 100 yuan. Qingjiao thin rice Huxian is 97 to 96.7 yuan, and original package is 101 yuan. Glutinous rice is rare both coming and going, with no movement in the market. Liyuan remains at 90 yuan, Gangyuan is 78 yuan, determined at 75 yuan, and Nuolv is 71 yuan.

Looking back at the market's rise and fall throughout the year, the price of foreign rice at the beginning of spring was around 40 yuan, and currently it is more than 80 yuan. The price has risen by 50 yuan per picul. Domestic rice has risen even more due to disrupted supply. It is said that Changxi rice has disappeared from the market, and Kunshan japonica has become the best japonica rice. The rice produced in the Changxi area is all being taken away by a certain party, and imports to Shanghai are being prevented, making japonica rice a scarce commodity in Shanghai. The japonica rice being sold is also mostly mixed, with thick and thin pieces mixed together. You pay a high price but cannot get good rice. It is the same with foreign rice. No. 1 Saigon originally contained 25% broken rice, or 40 out of 200 parts, but now the so-called No. 1 Saigon in each rice store contains much more broken rice, not just 20%. As for the end of the settlement period, the Shanghai storage, according to industry insiders, including all shops, is no less than 600,000 to 700,000 bags. This storage cannot be considered weak. Furthermore, there are 300,000 to 400,000 bags of February futures arriving, bringing the total to nearly a million bags, enough to feed the entire population of Shanghai for four months. It is predicted that the market will not experience a storm when the market reopens, and rice prices may decline again. The rice market has ended. We will report again when the market reopens on the fifth or sixth day of the new year.

Foreign rice is arriving one after another. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Jiangsu ship arrived in Shanghai, carrying 9,296 bags from Hong Kong, and unloaded them at the company's pier on the Bund in the French Concession.

### Coal: Indian Coal Quiet

Indian bituminous coal has been very sluggish recently. Factories have stopped working due to the end of the year, and demand is weak. Orders from merchants are also very small. The market situation is very depressed, and the market price is declining due to oversupply. Recently, the price of Indian lump coal has fallen below 230 yuan, and the price of standard coal has also fallen to 210 yuan. Therefore, it is difficult to rebound during this lunar year.

### Piece Goods: Little Activity in Cotton Cloth

The cotton cloth market was stable yesterday. With the lunar year end approaching, most merchants and dealers have stopped trading and are waiting for business to resume next spring. There are no large-scale sales to customers. Industry insiders have absorbed slightly lower-priced hand goods, and most of the sales market is stagnant. Hand goods have seen slight differences in sales prices. The total sales volume on the street was over 200 pieces. Customers from the Ningbo and Wenzhou groups bought 50-60 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth. Customers from the Fujian and Guangdong groups bought 100+ pieces of Dapeng, Changgui fine cloth, pongee, and colored cloth. Customers from the northern route bought 100+ pieces of bleached and dyed cloth and coarse cloth.

The Eastern Cloth market was stable. The finest white cloth fluctuated between 45.10 yuan and 45.05 yuan. There was some trading in the morning, but the market was unusually quiet in the afternoon. Fine cloth and high-grade fine twill cloth of mid-range brands were out of stock, and prices increased by 0.15-0.3 yuan per piece.

### Woolen Cloth Industry Busy Collecting Debts

The woolen cloth industry was mostly busy collecting debts yesterday, especially the consignment group, which had more to do because they extended more credit than the major groups on Qipan Street. Looking at this year's collection rate, the majority were worse than the last two years. The industry extended more credit to the Western suit industry than in previous years and were more lenient in their selection. Consequently, the percentage collected during the end-of-year period was also lower.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Prices Fall

Why Use a Substitute to Find an Export Certificate? The Shanghai silk market has been dull this week. Yesterday, silk merchants slightly increased their inventory. White Filature Silk 20/22 78 grade was sold at 4,950 yuan. The price at the end of last week was 5,150 yuan. Therefore, it was down 200 yuan from the previous market.

Previously, there was a rumor that an export certificate was obtained for the price of 250 yuan. To avoid causing a misunderstanding in the silk industry, I would like to clarify that, as far as I know, recently, due to difficult inspections, among the silk merchants' clients, there were some with surplus funds who were not in a hurry to sell and were willing to sell their goods at a good price. However, their previously obtained export certificates, which had already been inspected, could be transferred to others. And the clients who wanted to get rid of inventory quickly, could obtain this and be able to export, hence there was a "price of 250 yuan to obtain an export certificate." However, this type of transaction is limited to the relationship between silk merchants, and is not standard or permanent in nature.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Stable

The sugar market trended stable yesterday, with the settlement approaching. Spot prices for 2/4 grade coarse white sugar were 82.6 yuan for February 15 delivery, and 80.15 yuan to 82.4 yuan for February 10 delivery, unchanged. Taikoo car white B Mark East pier old goods were 82.15 yuan, West pier new goods were 82.3 yuan, and small 0.2 yuan. DY Mark West pier new goods were 80.5 yuan, and HX Mark West pier new goods were 80.2 yuan. Dutch red was 66.7 yuan to 66.5 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Vermicelli Sales Active and Rising

Due to the approaching lunar New Year, demand for longkou vermicelli has increased sharply, so the price has rebounded. Yesterday, the price of Longkou vermicelli was 190 yuan, up more than 10 yuan. Qingdao vermicelli was 160 yuan, up 5 yuan. Gao Jiangbei vermicelli also required 120 yuan. The market is stable.

### Black Melon Seeds, Large Size, More Popular

The supply of black melon seeds is naturally scarce, and the production price is tight. With the approaching lunar New Year, the sales volume of this item is naturally high, so large-sized Jikui seeds rose by 6 yuan, now at 106 yuan. The rest are slightly tight. Considering the current stock level, there is still a long selling period ahead, and there should be continued tightening.

### Hardware: Price Surge Begins Sharply

The hardware market, due to the approaching end of the year and the interruption of overseas supplies, is seeing traders hoarding goods and anticipating a bullish start to the new year. The quoted prices of various goods are changing several times a day, and all are rising without decline. The price surge is unstoppable. Current quoted prices for various goods in the market are: Wooden pegs and braces, $82 per barrel; bamboo steel bars, $1,400 per ton; black iron billets, $1,500 per bundle; British steel plates, 7.5mm, $110; 5mm, $105; 1mm or thicker patterned plates require $115; Menglin steel, 4mm, $125; new lead wire, sizes 8 to 15, $115; sizes 16 to 20, $145; sizes 21 to 25, $170.

### A Quarrel of a "Virtuous Couple"

— Shui Rong

People in the alley all say that Mr. Wu, the tenant of Room 3 in No. 21, is a very good person. "Couldn't be more proper!" After everyone said that, as if afraid of missing out on a merit, they immediately added, "Isn't Mrs. Wu good too? She keeps all three children clean and tidy. Unlike other families, they're always dragging their snotty noses and making noise in the alley! And they're all so well-behaved. After all, they eat bank food-"

Mr. Wu eats bank food. "Couldn't be more proper!" People in the alley never saw him smoke a cigarette. Nor did any hotel waiters come to the Wu's house. The Wu's only maid often complained to her fellow "sisters" about the hardship of not having tips. Mr. Wu also seemed to have very few social engagements: every morning around eight o'clock, everyone saw him taking Ah Da out. Always that shiny long gown, those peeled "bitter-joy, bitter-joy" old leather shoes! Left hand carrying a satchel. A newspaper and one or two borrowed books from some library tucked under his left shoulder blade. Right hand holding Ah Da. Ah Da, who is more than four years old, is quite lively! "Look, people are already in the first grade before they're even five years old." The hostess of the house next door often said this to her own child. In the afternoon, around five o'clock, the sound of "bitter-joy, bitter-joy" leather shoes echoed in the alley again, that was Mr. Wu coming home on time.

Every morning, before Mr. Wu left the house, Mrs. Wu, wearing a blue cloth cheongsam, her right foot dragging a flat-heeled leather shoe with a broken buckle, would run in from outside carrying a vegetable basket. Don't underestimate her appearance as a female worker; it is said that she graduated from some middle school! Many of the neighboring maids and older sisters would come to ask her to read and write letters. When she came back from buying groceries, she would start cooking in the kitchen with a flurry of activity. Then she would run to the attic to feed Ah San and teach Ah Er to read. As soon as she finished panting, she had to go to school to pick up Ah Da for lunch.

Mr. Wu also came back for lunch. After lunch, he would take Ah Da out again. Mrs. Wu did needlework at home, nursed, ... until about four o'clock, and then went out to pick up Ah Da. ... Their only maid did the cooking, washing clothes, tidying up the rooms, emptying the chamber pots, and so on.

The days passed mechanically, seemingly forever lacking in change. On Sundays, people in the alley only saw the whole Wu family go out. That was when they went to visit Mr. Wu's father, or to the nearby children's park.

Life seemed busy, difficult, and couldn't be more frugal. But there were no complaints, no sighs. Perhaps because there was simply no leisure to do so. Mr. Wu and his wife were united by love. Mrs. Wu had kept her promise to "share joys and sorrows." Only sometimes, Mr. Wu couldn't help but feel ashamed, feeling sorry for his wife and children.

Days passed by in this stagnant, ordinary way. At this time, the outside world had changed greatly! The high tide of prices also frequently impacted this quiet corner. Mrs. Wu began to complain that the vegetables were really expensive, three dishes for one yuan, making people run around in the vegetable market! At the same time, rice, rent, and everything else skyrocketed!

The bank where Mr. Wu worked added a second allowance. But that was of little help. The allowance could not keep up with the jumping prices of rice, rent, and daily necessities! Because of this, Mr. Wu couldn't help but frown. Mrs. Wu, in her own position, shared her husband's worries.

So one day, when their only maid took the opportunity to resign, Mrs. Wu suggested, "We can do without a maid. Wouldn't that save us more than thirty yuan, including wages and food?"

This was decided. Mrs. Wu became even busier. She almost took over all the work of the maid. Mr. Wu also added a lot of trivial matters. Before dawn, Mrs. Wu would get up and not wash the dishes until nine o'clock in the evening. Even with her eyelids heavy, she still had to do some needlework while the children were sound asleep. Mr. Wu didn't sleep either, he had to use this time to read some books or write something to send to the newspaper to exchange for money.

"Isn't this still good?" Mrs. Wu often said to Mr. Wu with a smile. "You've lost weight, dear. You're working too hard!" "Where? No!" Mrs. Wu insisted.

But one day, this "virtuous couple" actually quarreled! The reason for the quarrel was trivial to the point of insignificance: it was a Sunday morning, and Mrs. Wu bought the porridge and vegetables late, and the children clamored for porridge. So Mrs. Wu said, "Ah Da, go buy it!" Mr. Wu was shaving and found these words a bit jarring. "What do you mean by this? If you want me to go, just ask! Why do you have to beat around the bush?"

That's how they started quarreling! Both began to accuse each other of the misery and oppression that life had given them over the past half month. Life was like a filthy river, and they were struggling in it. There was no laughter or singing. They were both wrong.

Mrs. Wu did the laundry without eating breakfast. That morning, people in the alley saw Mr. Wu buying a large bundle of pancakes and fried dough sticks and rushing home. This small storm subsided.

Death: "Come to me, no need to eat rice."

"You come in here, I have something to ask you!" Shao Wen suddenly shouted at him loudly.

Rongkui dared not be negligent, hurriedly straightened his blue cloth gown, immediately lifted the curtain and walked in, hanging his hands down, first called out "Seventh Master", and then called out "Sir" to Yu and Zhang respectively.

"What do you old people want to say?"

"I'm asking you... Yesterday there was an old woman-looking woman talking to you suspiciously outside the First Building, what was she doing?" Shao Wen stared at Rongkui's small round face and asked sternly.

"Ah... her? This guy is very frivolous behind people's backs, and pretends to be simple in front of people," the young man stammered and said, "She is my aunt. Yesterday she was discussing family matters with me there.

Shaowen shook his head coldly.

"I'm afraid she's not your aunt, but a matchmaker!"

Zhang Tianming and Yu Zhongqian laughed.

"Yes, she is indeed my aunt, she only got married last year!" Rongkui hurriedly explained, but he was too busy saying it, which revealed a big loophole.

"Only got married last year? Don't be blinded by money! Yesterday that old woman was at least fifty years old!" Shaowen raised his left sleeve even higher, revealing an even more serious spirit, and said: "Tell you, Rongkui, last time you took a hundred dollars from someone and wanted to get customers for your boss, if it really suits your heart, let alone his voice will be ruined, even if that Director Lu knows about his wife's good deeds, he probably won't let her off easily! You eat your boss's food, if you really want to curry favor with him, just take care of those few sets of clothes! I advise you not to worry too much about this kind of thing! Next time I find out about this kind of thing, I will definitely tell you to get out!"

This scolding was indeed not what the famously shrewd Rongkui had expected, but he also knew Yuan Qiye's power, as well as his friendship with Qiu Haitang, so of course he did not dare to resist, and could only repeatedly say: "How dare I, how dare I"; while his feet understood, seizing the opportunity for Yuan Shaowen to turn around and talk to Zhang Tianming, he immediately burrowed out like a rabbit. As he walked back to the First Building, he was calculating in his mind all the way.

"This Yuan Laoqi is even more cunning than me! How could he have known what people were doing in private? It seems that I should stop! Don't end up with no money in my pocket, and break my rice bowl instead." (16)

Psychology

### How to Realize Ideals

— Tong Fang

Some people interpret ideals as delusions and fantasies, believing that they are merely castles in the air that people imagine, and that they will never be realized. From psychological research, we know that this is wrong. Delusion is a symptom manifested by mental patients, and it is a false belief with no possibility of realization. Fantasy is also a manifestation of a tendency towards mental illness. In terms of the degree of the disease, it is more disordered and aimless than delusion, and the patient's behavior completely falls into a confused state of madness.

The most significant difference between ideals and delusions and fantasies lies in the fact that they are based on the objective background of society and the times, and they make reasonable expectations for future careers and work without exceeding the facts. It is a correct concept, and it can also be said to be an organized plan. This concept and plan is produced under the influence of facts.

Since ideals have the possibility of realization, how should we promote their realization?

First, we must grasp reality. Ideals and reality are closely linked. The foundation of ideals must be built on the rock of reality. The magnificent and towering palace of ideals cannot be built unless we hold firmly to reality and make the most of it and improve it. Therefore, everyone who hopes to have a fulfilling future must work hard at present and set a reasonable code of life.

Second, we must proceed step by step and gradually complete. No matter how towering and magnificent the building is, the craftsmen always use bricks and tiles to build it up, and each small action will slowly realize the house that the engineer envisioned. Therefore, if you want any ideal to be realized, you must first divide the large goal into small steps, concentrate your strength, and slowly do it step by step; each success can increase our self-confidence and give an encouragement to the second step of work. With the goal approaching, there is a great certainty of realizing the ideal.

Third, we must persevere and be patient. A decadent and demoralized state of mind is a fatal blow to the realization of ideals. Great achievements must rely on an indomitable spirit and persistent perseverance. It is difficult for people who become discouraged and lose the courage to make a second attempt after encountering setbacks to realize their ideals.

By following the above three points, we can break the common misconception that ideals cannot be realized. Ideals are by no means "utopian." With your perseverance, self-confidence, and continuous efforts, you can definitely achieve a fulfilling realization.

### The Philosophy of a Striving Life (15)

When making a final decision, being able to concentrate fully, the light of reason suddenly shines brightly, illuminating everything thoroughly, leaving no stone unturned. The most fearful thing is to be in a state of confusion, to be at a loss, neither left nor right, reluctantly making a decision, which is mostly wrong, because reason has retreated to a powerless position.
