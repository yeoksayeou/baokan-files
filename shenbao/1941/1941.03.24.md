### Ambassador Hu Shih Publishes an Article: China Will Surely Live Up to American Expectations

Manila - Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, will publish an article here tomorrow commemorating the 41st anniversary of the local newspaper, thanking the United States for its effective assistance and moral encouragement whenever China's war effort has been slightly unfavorable or the morale of the people has declined. Ambassador Hu recalled the various US loans to China, saying, "These were all done by the United States for the benefit of its national defense policy, but our government and people deeply feel its moral impact on our war of resistance. I assure millions of Chinese friends that our people will do their best to live up to the sympathy of the American people. We have resisted aggression and fought hard for three and a half years. Our own fighting also helps those elsewhere in the world who are engaged in the same war. We have prevented one of the most terrible aggressors from taking advantage of the European war to plunder the most advantageous places. Now that the United States has given moral and economic assistance, and the international situation has also turned in favor of China, the Chinese people will continue as before, determined to continue fighting for years or months, until a fair and lasting peace is achieved."

### China and Britain Fight Together to Defend the Stronghold of Democracy

Manila - Chinese Consul General Dr. Yang Guangzhu declared today, "London and Chongqing have become the first line of defense to protect the fate of all nations that believe in freedom and democracy." Dr. Yang said in a speech at the 20th graduation ceremony of the Chinese Hospital Nursing School here, "In the past year, many countries have disappeared from the map. The remaining small countries can no longer believe that maintaining neutrality and not offending others will exempt them from aggression. After Japan's war against China became difficult, it shifted its target to Southeast Asia, where British and American global businesses are linked by Singapore and the Philippines. The future global dominance of Britain and the United States depends entirely on the individual or collective strength of this connection. If we want to consolidate this British-American connection, China naturally has a very important relationship. If the people of Southeast Asia engage in preparation, it may be possible to hope that atrocities will not invade Southeast Asia, but in the current situation, whether pessimistic or optimistic, we must accept reality. The cruel reality of international chaos has come upon us, and escape will not be spared. If we rise up and resist it, we can survive; if we surrender to it, we will be destroyed."

Editorial

### Germany Launches a Major Atlantic Offensive

The recent struggle between Britain and Germany is unfolding on two fronts: the contest in the Balkans and the battle in the Atlantic. Now, Yugoslavia's accession is at the final decision stage. Although opposition forces still permeate the country, they are hardly able to prevent its authorities from throwing themselves into the embrace of the Axis. In response to this movement, in addition to Britain's serious vigilance in that area, the Soviet Union has also shown greater sincerity towards Turkey, guaranteeing that in the event that Turkey's relations with a third party deteriorate, the Soviet side will not take any actions that hinder Turkey's steps to respond. This is a significant change compared to the situation more than a year ago when the Soviet Union repeatedly hoped that Turkey would lift its obligations to Britain. At the same time, it can also confirm that the subtle reactions caused in the Soviet Union by Bulgaria's accession are still continuing to develop. The American United Press recently reported the speculation of American military experts that Hitler was preparing to attack the British-Greek Allied forces from Bulgaria in order to peer into the Suez Canal. This speculation is of course based on something. Assuming that Hitler does not operate in this way, it is also very likely that the German side's management of the Balkans will temporarily take Yugoslavia's entry as enough. What they have been striving for recently is to concentrate their naval and air power in the English Channel and the Atlantic to launch a major offensive against Britain. This Nazi offensive has not actually stopped over the years, but recently, with the change of seasons and the passage of the American Lend-Lease Act, it does have the opportunity to intensify its brutal offensive.

In the first week of this month, the tonnage of British ships sunk by the German side reached 148,000 tons, becoming the peak of the weekly statistics in recent months. According to yesterday's news, in addition to continuing to expand the submarine offensive, its only two battlecruisers, the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, have also sailed into the western Atlantic, carrying out raids on the ocean surface not far from American territorial waters. According to the figures published by the German side, the results of the raids have created a historical record. Although some of what is said may be exaggerated, in any case, under the German side's expansion of raids, British ships will inevitably suffer significant losses. Complementing this, the Nazi air raids on Britain have also become increasingly fierce in recent days. The bombing of London on the 19th night and the bombing of Plymouth on the 21st and 22nd days each involved tens of thousands of bombs. Other shipbuilding areas, industrial areas, and key ports have also been repeatedly attacked. The German side boasts that these naval and air attacks are the launch of the spring offensive, so regardless of his achievements, it is undoubtedly that he has already launched an offensive.

Britain's maritime hegemony and its ability to defend the three islands will both face unprecedentedly severe tests here. Of course, in terms of the strength that Britain possesses, no matter how exaggerated the battle results announced by the German forces are, the distance between them and the goal of defeating Britain is still very far away. Just look at Britain's efforts to defend on the one hand, and still being able to fiercely bomb German territory and the bases and industrial areas in its occupied areas as retaliation. This is a sign of Britain's strong potential, but we still cannot ignore the seriousness of the troubles it is facing. Chatwick's intention is obviously to try to disrupt the order and productivity of Britain on the one hand, and to prevent the arrival of urgently needed food materials and war equipment on the other hand. At the same time, it is also making a direct response and indirect contest with the United States' implementation of aid to Britain, hoping to gain a strategic advantage over Britain before American aid arrives. From this, it can be seen that the anxiety repeatedly expressed by the American authorities that they could timely save Britain is by no means just a means of urging Congress to pass the Lend-Lease Act.

At this moment, Germany's war against Britain has added some new complex factors compared to before. This is the United States and its aid to Britain. Hitler has spent a lot of effort and twists and turns on his management of Southeastern Europe and his collusion with Japan. How effective they are is still questionable, and they are certainly not enough to compare with the United States, which shoulders the task of the arsenal of democracy. From the British point of view, the destruction and devastation they have suffered can easily be adequately compensated from across the Atlantic in the future. As for dealing with this major offensive by the German side, they only need to endure long-term hard support and still maintain a solid and intact foundation, then not only will the British Isles be absolutely worry-free in the future, but the Nazi offensive will inevitably wear down its spirit and weaken its strength due to the long term. It is seen that its allies in the Balkans and North Africa as well as the Far East will fall into a state of distress together. Another inference: assuming that the Nazi offensive against Britain succeeds this time, this is by no means a definite victory for the Nazis, because Britain's lifeline is not only entrusted to the British Isles, but also to its empire's territories spread all over the world. Moreover, the United States has long declared that it will never sit idly by and watch Britain's defeat, and has already begun to carry out its war preparations. At that time, Germany will inevitably risk a further joint war with Britain and the United States. Recently, both the American government and the public have revealed their determination to ensure that the war equipment aiding Britain is safely delivered to the front line. Although the amendment of the Lend-Lease Act by Congress does not immediately mean escorting, if the British are truly unable to resist the German warships' raids on their own, the Americans will never be able to let 7 billion worth of war equipment sink to the bottom of the Atlantic. Among the more than 100,000 tons of merchant ships lost by Britain in the Atlantic in the past week (according to German figures), it is still unclear whether it includes war equipment shipped from the United States, but under the expanded attacks of the German navy, it is ultimately difficult to absolutely avoid war equipment transported to Britain from sharing the fate of British ships carrying food and raw materials without special transportation methods and protection. Furthermore, German warships must take searching for and sinking these ships as their primary task, which is also a major key to the future evolution of US-German relations. The speculation that the United States will participate in the European war within ninety days may be too assertive, but the fierce offensive adopted by the German side in the Atlantic has pushed the United States to the brink of direct participation in the war.

### Rumor of German Letter to Yugoslav Prime Minister Urging a Quick Resolution to the Cabinet Crisis, Public Demonstrations Oppose Joining the Axis Powers, Britain and America Also Exerting Diplomatic Pressure on Yugoslavia

Capital of Yugoslavia – Rumors say that German Head of State Hitler demanded that Yugoslavia reorganize its cabinet within forty-eight hours and sign a treaty with the Axis powers. After this news spread, fierce disturbances occurred among the people in various provinces of Yugoslavia today. Although Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković has assured the German Minister to Yugoslavia, Heeren, that three new cabinet members will be sworn in today to replace those who resigned, his efforts to persuade popular leaders to join the government appear to have failed. It is said that since the German Minister to Yugoslavia, Heeren, handed Yugoslavia a letter that was practically an ultimatum, Prince Paul and Prime Minister Cvetković have redoubled their efforts to resolve the internal strife. It is reported that the American Minister to Yugoslavia, Lane, and the British Minister, Campbell, met with the Yugoslav Prime Minister and the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, Marković, yesterday. Since the sudden outbreak of the crisis on Friday, open demonstrations against joining the Axis powers were only initial yesterday. The Yugoslav government guarded the capital with a large police force. Several reserve officers and seasoned soldiers carried flags supporting Britain and staged anti-Axis power demonstrations. The Yugoslav High Command has canceled army leave, effective from Tuesday, indicating that the army is currently planning to deal with the internal strife that may be caused by the signing of the Axis powers treaty. Today, Prince Paul, disregarding the opposition of the people, decided to send Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković to Vienna tomorrow, as this is the only way to avoid war. It was learned at dawn today that the Yugoslav Prime Minister has found three Serbs willing to fill cabinet positions. It is generally believed that after the treaty is signed, the Yugoslav cabinet will resign en masse to avoid the responsibility for self-inflicted civil war. Fierce demonstrations demanding that Yugoslavia maintain neutrality and independence have erupted in various villages in the Montenegrin region. The Yugoslav Reserve Officers Association has resolved to disband, opposing the government's signing of a treaty that violates Yugoslavia's honor and independence. The association has sent a delegation to Prince Paul to tell the Yugoslav Regent, "We are prepared to defend our country's sovereignty and borders with our lives." (March 23rd International News Agency dispatch)

Capital of Yugoslavia – The national opposition to signing a treaty with the Axis powers seems to be gradually increasing. There was a small-scale anti-Axis demonstration outside the German embassy yesterday, but it did not reach a serious level. Diplomatic activities here were still very active yesterday. The Greek Minister visited the Yugoslav Foreign Minister. It is heard that three officers from the Yugoslav General Staff have entered Greece and left a letter stating that they want to fight immediately and cannot tolerate the current delay within Yugoslavia. It is also heard that four Yugoslav pilots have entered Greek territory in three aircraft and dedicated their planes to the Allied forces. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)

Capital of Yugoslavia – According to various sources, Yugoslavia will likely formally join the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan on the 25th or 27th of this month. Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, held talks with Army Chief of Staff General Kosić and former Prime Minister Ivković today. It was immediately decided that the national army should be on alert for three days, the 25th, 26th, and 27th of March, in order to suppress public demonstrations at any time. At that time, all officers and soldiers, except those who have obtained special permission, shall not leave the barracks even a step. The defenses along the border between Yugoslavia and Greece have also been strengthened. Although the government has not yet formally announced its decision to join the Tripartite Pact, the reports in the newspapers only say that the government has not made any decision that would violate national integrity and independence. However, this news has spread like wildfire throughout the country, and those who oppose Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact have organized various groups to oppose the government's decision. Minister of Justice Konstantinović and Minister of Social Welfare Budisavljević have submitted their resignations. Although the successors have not yet been formally announced, the general public is discussing the candidates. It is generally believed that the position of Minister of Justice will be succeeded by the government party leader Jagović, and the Minister of Social Welfare will be succeeded by Ivković, a member of the Independent Democratic Party. Minister of Agriculture Privić also intends to resign, and the vacant position will likely be succeeded by Joksić, a left-wing leader of the Peasant Party known for his pro-Soviet views. The government will announce the appointment of these three ministers at the same time as accepting the resignations of the previous three ministers. The government is currently continuing discussions with leaders of the Peasant Party and the Democratic Party to discuss national affairs, striving to eliminate the difficulties caused by the previous cabinet decision to join the Tripartite Pact. These two parties have decided to convene a plenary meeting on the afternoon of the 24th of this month, at which the three resigning ministers will deliver speeches, report on the situation, and explain the reasons for their resignations. Gavrilović, the leader of the Serbian Peasant Party and the current ambassador to the Soviet Union, has departed from Moscow to return home to participate in the meeting. It is not yet possible to confirm rumors that he has submitted his resignation. This rumor is likely due to the news that the entire Senate of the Peasant Party has resigned. Senator Čatagala of the party has also telegraphed Prince Paul to request a meeting and to request that the Senate be convened immediately to hold a foreign policy debate. In addition, several political groups and the Veterans Association of the last European War have also telegraphed Prince Paul and the government authorities, respectively, expressing their opposition to joining the Tripartite Pact and issuing warnings.

### Yugoslavia is About to Join the Axis Powers

Capital of Yugoslavia – Even with the intervention of Britain and America becoming increasingly urgent, the cabinet crisis in Yugoslavia appears to be approaching resolution tonight, as the country has almost decided to join the Axis powers within a few days. Informed sources say that the aim of Britain and America is to encourage Yugoslavia to stand firm against Germany and prevent Yugoslavia from signing the Tripartite Agreement. However, this intervention by the United States and Britain has come too late to prevent Yugoslavia from joining the Axis powers. (According to a Washington dispatch, Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States Fotić had three consultations with US Secretary of State Welles this week. Although Welles said that these consultations only discussed economic issues and were of a general nature, authoritative sources believe that the so-called economic issues can be regarded as the possibility of Yugoslavia obtaining assistance from the Lend-Lease Act. According to a London dispatch, British Minister to Yugoslavia Campbell has recently had frequent contact with Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul, and knowledgeable sources are keeping silent on the exchange of views between Britain and Yugoslavia. It is reported that Britain has indicated to Yugoslavia that joining the Axis powers will have certain consequences.) Informed sources here say that the government crisis appeared to be approaching resolution last night, which will be resolved by the appointment of the leader of the Slovenian Party as Minister of Justice, the leader of the Socialist Party as Minister of Social Welfare, and the leader of the Peasant Party as Minister of Agriculture. (March 23rd Associated Press dispatch)

Istanbul – After the Yugoslav Minister of Justice, the Minister of Social Welfare, and the Minister of Agriculture resigned one after another in opposition to the government's decision to join the Tripartite Pact, the newspapers here have commented on them. Among them, the semi-official "Ulus" newspaper stated that although Yugoslavia has a strong army of no less than one million men, its surrounding borders are almost entirely surrounded by the forces of the Axis powers. The Tripartite Pact is nothing more than a ready-made suit that cannot fit all customers, so it has to be slightly modified for Yugoslavia. In other words, it means that Hungary and Bulgaria should abandon their territorial claims against Yugoslavia and limit the signatory countries to only passing through Yugoslavia with military equipment and ambulances. However, the Yugoslav government is still hesitant. When the cabinet met the night before, Prime Minister Cvetković refused to express his opinion, and Minister of the Army General Pećić also did not attend. All of these points are quite noteworthy. (March 21st Havas dispatch)

Vichy – According to the Vichy news agency's dispatch from Bern, the American Minister to Yugoslavia visited Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković and inquired about Yugoslavia's current policies. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)

Berlin – The German official news agency said that Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul held talks with Prime Minister Cvetković this morning. Cvetković submitted a list of three new cabinet members to succeed those who had resigned. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)

Berlin – According to authoritative German sources, yesterday they refused to specify whether the Yugoslav cabinet dispute would delay the signing of the Tripartite Pact. Those sources even continued to say that there were negotiations between Germany and Yugoslavia, and that the resignation of three Yugoslav ministers was not necessarily directed against Germany. In fact, several of them are members of the Freemasons, and it is surprising that London attaches so much importance to this resignation. (March 23rd Associated Press dispatch)

### Former Romanian Prime Minister Arrives in Egypt

Egypt – Former Romanian Prime Minister Stoedinovici has arrived here after being escorted out of the country by Romanian police officers. This statement was recently confirmed by the authorities. The Romanian government requested Britain to guarantee his personal safety. Stoedinovici, who was known for his pro-Axis leanings, was placed under official surveillance after stepping down in 1939. (March 22nd Havas dispatch)

### Soviet Union to Provide New Guarantees to Turkey, If Turkey Conflicts with Other Countries, the Soviet Union Will Not Attack Turkey

Ankara – Informed sources here said that according to a telegram received by the Vichy News Agency, a declaration of policy between Turkey and the Soviet Union may be signed in Moscow today. This declaration will reaffirm the intention of Turkey and the Soviet Union to maintain peaceful relations. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)

Istanbul – According to news here today, the Soviet Union and Turkey have agreed on a joint declaration, which may be issued tomorrow. The Soviet Union will guarantee that in the event that Turkey fights to defend its country, its Caucasian border will not be invaded. Diplomatic circles here believe that this declaration will greatly affect the Balkan crisis, especially Yugoslavia. The declaration will be issued simultaneously in Istanbul and Moscow. It is reported that the content is to reaffirm the Soviet-Turkish non-aggression pact and guarantee that "Soviet-Turkish friendship will not change when Turkey is at odds with other countries." It is also heard that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu assured the Yugoslav ambassador to Turkey yesterday that if Turkey can get the help of Britain and Greece if Yugoslavia is invaded, Turkey will help Yugoslavia. As for why the Soviet Union is willing to encourage Turkey, it is generally believed that it is to prevent Germany from attacking the Dardanelles Strait. (March 23rd International News Agency dispatch)

Istanbul – Reliable sources here said yesterday that the Soviet Union has provided the Turkish government with a written guarantee that Turkey need not fear a Soviet attack if the political situation in Turkey deteriorates. Informed sources believe that this guarantee is tantamount to indicating that if Turkey has a military conflict with Germany, the Soviet Union will not take the opportunity to attack Turkey. (March 23rd Associated Press dispatch)

Istanbul – According to reliable sources, the Soviet government has guaranteed Turkey that if Turkey's relations with any third country rapidly deteriorate, the Soviet Union will not take any action that would hinder Turkey. Although a Soviet-Turkish non-aggression pact exists, this new guarantee will place Soviet-Turkish relations on a firm and unshakable foundation. It is said that after the wording of the communiqué is finalized, this guarantee will be announced. People here believe that this development is of utmost importance, as it strengthens Turkey's domestic and foreign position and dispels its fears about the eastern frontier. It is heard that the Yugoslav Minister and the British Ambassador to Ankara visited the Turkish Foreign Minister yesterday. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)

Moscow – It is now learned that the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky had a meeting on Friday night. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)

Istanbul – After former Turkish Minister of Justice Okier resigned last week for health reasons, the National Assembly elected him as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He is a representative of pro-British policies. His departure from the cabinet was generally regarded as a result of differences of opinion with the President and the Prime Minister. His comeback this time has surprised many parties. (March 23rd Haitian News Agency dispatch)

Istanbul – The Turkish National Assembly has passed the government's proposal in a plenary session to allocate 30,000,000 pounds for national defense expenditures. This fund will be paid from loans from the National Bank. (March 23rd Haitian News Agency dispatch)

### German Planes Bomb Plymouth, Dropping 30,000 Bombs, British Air Force Retaliates by Attacking Various German Bases

London – It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on Plymouth by enemy aircraft on Friday night, and hundreds of high-explosive bombs were also dropped. The intensity was greater than on Thursday. Enemy bombers indiscriminately wreaked havoc on residential and shopping areas, causing several areas to be reduced to ashes. However, the public, police, and firefighters still showed a spirit of perseverance and fearlessness, which was praised by those who witnessed it. Australian Prime Minister Menzies happened to arrive in Plymouth after the air raid began and inspected various places at risk during the air raid. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)

London – According to a British Air Ministry communiqué, enemy aircraft activity in British skies on Saturday was not extensive. Except for some material damage and casualties caused by bombing in eastern Anglia, there were no reports of enemy aircraft wreaking havoc elsewhere. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)

London – After German planes launched fierce attacks on London and British ports, the British Air Force retaliated by launching fierce air raids on important bases that Hitler considered extremely relevant to naval warfare in the past week. Several towns in the Ruhr heavy industrial area were attacked. Due to bad weather, the air raids were limited to only a few nights. The shipyards of Emden and Wilhelmshaven in Germany were attacked twice, causing major fires. The industrial areas of Kiel and Bremen were also bombed. The Lorient submarine base in France was attacked twice, and coastal ships were attacked several times. Other targets, such as the Gelsenkirchen synthetic oil plant in Germany, the industrial area of Düsseldorf, and the railway freight yards, factories, and oil plants of Cologne, were also attacked, with lights illuminating the sky. The oil storage tanks in the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands were bombed four times, and the fire could be seen from 100 miles away on one night. Many enemy airfields and enemy aircraft on the ground were also damaged. British aircraft lost five aircraft in the past week but destroyed three enemy aircraft and severely damaged two others. In the week ending at dawn yesterday, a total of six German aircraft were destroyed over Britain, including four bombers, one shot down on the night of March 15, two shot down during the day on the 18th, two enemy aircraft shot down on the 19th, and one enemy aircraft shot down again on the night of the 19th. British aircraft lost three aircraft in combat, but the two pilots were unharmed. In the Middle East theater, 20 Italian aircraft were destroyed this week, and British aircraft lost six aircraft. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)

Berlin – According to sources here, German bomber groups continued to attack enemy ships near the Mediterranean and the British Isles yesterday. In the Mediterranean, a cargo ship was heavily damaged after being bombed and strafed by German planes and has almost sunk. A cargo ship in the George Channel was destroyed by German planes flying at low altitude. (March 23rd Haitian News Agency dispatch)

### Germany Launches Naval Offensive Against Britain, Says It Has Achieved Results

Berlin – Dr. Hellwe, of the Hamburg newspaper, commented last night that 224,000 tons of British ships were sunk in one day, saying that the decisive battle in the Atlantic has now begun. From now on, Germany's attacks on British ships will not stop. The combined attacks by German planes and submarines are achieving great results. From now on, Britain will become the front line. (March 23rd Haitian News Agency dispatch)

Berlin – According to statistics released yesterday afternoon, 224,000 tons of British ships were sunk within 24 hours, setting a new record for German attacks on enemy ships. Of these, 116,000 tons were sunk by German ships in the Atlantic, 77,000 tons were sunk by German submarines near the west coast of Africa, and 31,000 tons were sunk by German planes in the Mediterranean, Ireland, and the east coast of Britain. German planes also severely damaged a 6,000-ton ship, which has almost sunk. (March 23rd Haitian News Agency dispatch)

Berlin – German capital ships sunk 116,000 tons of enemy merchant ships in a dense formation in the Atlantic, a pioneering feat in German naval history and the first time German capital ships have directly attacked the enemy's main lines of communication. At that time, enemy merchant ships were closely protected by capital ships and light warships, and German ships achieved results by attacking outnumbered. (March 23rd Haitian News Agency dispatch)

A Port in Eastern Canada – According to sailors on a cargo ship that recently arrived here yesterday, they fear that a British oil tanker and a cargo ship may have been sunk by enemy submarines off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. A few days ago, the two ships repeatedly sent distress signals, saying they were being attacked by a German submarine. There has been no news since. It is generally believed that Nazi submarines were operating 300 miles off the coast of Newfoundland a few days ago. (March 23rd International News Agency dispatch)

London – News here today says that Germany is making Narvik a huge base for German submarines in the Atlantic. It is also reported that the railway from Narvik to Sweden is currently being repaired by the Germans. It is reported that the road is dedicated to transporting iron ore. (March 23rd International News Agency dispatch)

London – According to a Reuters dispatch from Alexandria, the British Navy in the Mediterranean is undertaking the major task of intensifying the blockade and ensuring the safety of Allied ships during the war. According to a recent communiqué from the Navy, the sinking of Italian transport and supply ships by British submarines is only a part of the British Navy's work. Since the British Navy has control of the central and eastern Mediterranean, it can escort shells and bombs used to bomb Italian forces safely to various ports in Greece and the East and can also prevent Italian supplies from being transported to Albania and Tripoli. The German High Command is greatly alarmed to see the British naval power becoming increasingly stable and deliberately makes false propaganda that German torpedo planes have hit two Malayan battleships. In fact, there is absolutely no basis for this statement. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)

### British Forces Besiege East Africa: The Fate of Eritrea May Soon Be Determined; Italian Transportation Subjected to Intense Allied Air Raids

Khartoum: Yesterday, British and Imperial troops again repelled an Italian counter-attack near Keren in Eritrea, capturing 80 soldiers. British forces advanced on the Dologorodoc Fortress, which controls the entrance to Keren, while Free French forces advanced from the northeast despite strong Italian resistance. Allied artillery and air forces continued to bombard the area around Keren. The battle progresses smoothly, and its result may determine the fate of Eritrea. British forces are now vigorously defending the positions they have seized and have repelled multiple counterattacks. In Abyssinia, British and Abyssinian patriotic forces are effectively harassing Italian forces near Dibalama Kos, about 110 miles from the Abyssinian capital. (Reuters, 213th)

Cairo: Yesterday, British aircraft bombed railways within Keren, while planes to the south targeted the supply station at Asab. The railway between Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa was also attacked, with good results. Several bombs struck the Dire Dawa station. Three trains and motorized transport units were strafed. A large fire broke out when the Gondar military camp was attacked. British planes completed their missions and returned safely. (Reuters, 23rd)

Rome: The Italian government yesterday officially confirmed that British forces have captured the strategically important town of Gallabat on the border between Libya and Egypt. The town is equipped with fortifications. British forces announced its capture on Friday. The Italian government stated, "Our small garrison defended the town for four months, but was overwhelmed by the enemy's superior numbers and mechanized forces." (Associated Press, 23rd)

### Record-Breaking British Aircraft Production: Air Force Strength Greatly Increased; Batch of New American Aircraft Arrives in London

London: The Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, announced in a radio broadcast today that the number of bombers and fighters currently possessed by Britain is at an unprecedented record high. As a result of matching British reserves with these aircraft, it was discovered on Wednesday that the number of aircraft immediately available for deployment is greater than ever before. Regarding production, the production of bombers and fighters in February also set new records. Regarding aircraft research, all development work in the past nine months has increased greatly compared to the past. Six new types of aircraft have been added to combat, named (1) the "Typhoon" fighter, (2) the "Fulmar," (3) the "Whirlwind," (4) the "Stirling," (5) the "Halifax," and (6) the "Manchester." The standards for the "Hurricane" and "Spitfire" have also been improved. Currently, there are two new types of aircraft that have reached the production stage from the development stage. In addition, there are more types under development that will soon be produced. (Reuters, 23rd)

### American Invention: Scrap Iron Smelting

New York Air Dispatch: The famous American inventor, Dai Han Fulei, has recently invented a method to turn scrap iron into steel. According to Dai himself, steel produced by this new method will soon be produced in large quantities. (Havas, 23rd)

London: It was announced here this afternoon that a four-engine aircraft transported from the United States has now been delivered to the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The first type of aircraft flown to Britain is the "Liberator." This name was given by the British to a long-range heavy bomber manufactured by the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation of San Diego, California. This monoplane is sixty feet long, one hundred and ten feet wide, and its engines can develop up to one thousand two hundred horsepower upon takeoff. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Italian Forces in Central Albania Fail in Counter-Attack

Athens: The Athens radio station announced today that Italian forces have launched a new offensive in the Aelos River area of the central Albanian front. After two hours of intense fighting, the Italian forces were finally repelled with heavy losses. It is said that the Italian forces first bombarded heavily with artillery, and then a large number of infantry rushed forward, but failed to penetrate the Greek fire net, and as a result, they retreated in a panic, leaving piles of corpses behind. It is also said that the Italian Air Force bombed various island prefectures, but Greek losses were minimal. (International Dispatch, 23rd)

### Germany Promotes New Economic Plan During Wartime: Suppresses Prices, Promotes Savings; Industrial Raw Materials Not Feared to Be Scarce

Berlin: The German Minister of Economic Affairs, Lauk, announced Germany's new economic plan yesterday at a meeting of the Deutsche Bank, stating briefly that the economy should give private capital the opportunity to develop. At the same time, as a result of the war, there are some aspects of capital development that are blameworthy. Germany's war expenses are quite sufficient. In the sixteen months of combat, Germans have saved more money than last year. The new measures recently announced by the Price Management Committee are the main part of Germany's new wartime economy. The plan is to reduce prices and hand over wartime profits to the government. Reducing prices can stabilize the national economic life and enable all aspects of the economy to develop equally. This new measure does not completely abolish profits, it only prevents the sharp increase in prices. (Haitong Dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin: At the Deutsche Bank's regular meeting yesterday, General Hannigan reported on the state of raw materials in Germany, briefly stating that since Germany occupied the Western Front areas, steel production has increased by one and a half times. Coal production is far greater than that of Britain. The need for rubber can be met by man-made elastic materials. The amount of man-made crude oil produced from coal is also large. Gasoline shipped from the Soviet Union is constant. Germany's aluminum production is even greater than the combined quantity of Britain and the United States. (Haitong Dispatch, 23rd)

### Seeking to Develop Trade with the Far East

Berlin: Due to the results of the Tripartite Pact, the German industrial world sees that there will be broad development of the Far Eastern economy. A Far Eastern Economic Committee has been established, chaired by Weber of the German Dye Trust. Weber has visited the Far East many times. He reported on the political and military situation in the Far East at the first meeting of the committee, and discussions were held. Wu Sate, the leader of the German delegation for economic negotiations with Japan; Voss, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Dr. Spindler, a representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, all participated. Wu reported on Far Eastern trade policy and mentioned the economic negotiations with Japan. (Haitong Dispatch, 23rd)

### Syria: An Important Gateway to the Near East, Strategically Indispensable

New York: The long-range operational plans of the belligerent nations include a strategically important and little-known region, namely the small French-mandated territory of Syria. This territory includes five previously semi-autonomous states, separated from Turkey after the World War, whose independence was also recognized at that time, and which were managed by France under a League of Nations mandate. Syria's military importance lies entirely in its location. Syria is the gateway to the rich oilfields of Iraq, Iran, Soviet territory, and Arabia. It borders the Mediterranean Sea on the west, Iraq on the east, Turkey on the north, and Palestine on the south. Syria is ethnically diverse, with Arabs, Jews, Persians, Turks, Kurds, and Armenians, but the Arabs are the majority. The area is crossed by the Lebanon Mountains mentioned in the Bible, and it is located in the Euphrates River basin. After the fall of France, Italy paid great attention to Syria. Italy is eyeing the oil flowing through Syria and the large quantities of unused French military equipment stored there, and is thinking of seizing it. Last September, Italy demanded that the French naval base, airfield, and military center in Lebanon and Syria be transferred to the Italian army, but Italy's plan was unsuccessful because these had already been sold to the Lebanese government. In the first few months of the war, the elite of the French army gathered in Syria. Their training was supposed to be for fighting the Italians in North Africa, but they never had a chance to join the battle. General Weygand, who organized them, was recalled home in the spring of 1940 to lead the defeated French army. As a result, when France fell, the troops in Syria never had a chance to fight. Many leaders of the French army in Syria, young officers, were heartbroken by France's surrender. They still sympathize with England, and many of them crossed the border into British territory in Palestine. Britain hopes to persuade this once-powerful French army to join the battle again. At the beginning, it was estimated that the army had 200,000 to 250,000 trained soldiers, with the latest war equipment. Turkey also does not want to see Syria fall into Italian hands. Turkey has warned Italy not to try to take over the area. As a result of the British invasion of Libya, Italy's threat to Syria has obviously decreased. Britain's territory in the Near East is no longer in immediate danger of being attacked by the Axis powers, and Britain's prestige in the Muslim countries (including Syria) has therefore increased. Moreover, the British Mediterranean Fleet controls Syria's sea lanes, and the Italian Navy has not indicated that it wants to challenge Britain at sea. Syria is an agricultural country. The main agricultural products are wheat, barley, oats, rye, and cereals. Vegetables and fruits are also produced in abundance. Tobacco and cotton are also produced. There is also animal husbandry, as well as common mineral products. The population is one million, mostly Muslims, and the language is Arabic. (Associated Press, 23rd)

### Miscellaneous Talks on the European War (4) (1): General Discussion on European War Strategy

As a result, no fewer than forty divisions were concentrated on the sixty-mile line between Antwerp and Namur, reaching a density of one division per one and a half miles. But in the northeast of the Belgian-French border, the opposite was true, with only a small number of divisions, poorly qualified and lacking anti-tank guns, defending the area. In fact, one division had to defend twenty miles of the front.

Even more astonishing, when the German armored divisions charged out of the Ardennes near Sedan, the French forces defending the section of the road were not even defending it, and the bridges spanning the Meuse River fell into the hands of the Germans unscathed.

Because of these "inconceivable errors," the Germans were able to break through a large gap. Their progress was unexpectedly smooth, and the severe errors in the defenders' preparations had an even greater impact. Although France had suffered a painful experience in 1914, and Belgium's adherence to neutrality made it even more vulnerable to enemy attacks, the French army was still unprepared and did not build a line on the Belgian border that was comparable to the Maginot or Siegfried Line. At the same time, neither France nor Britain made any effort to organize armored divisions, preparing to immediately launch a vigorous counterattack when the front line was broken.

If we analyze the facts of the war in detail, we can see that the strength of the defense is still higher than I estimated. The German side tried its best to avoid making direct attacks on the enemy, and the French army's formal counterattacks almost all collapsed, resulting in heavy losses, so that later there was no continued resistance.

When the Germans attacked, they took advantage of gaps and broke through a section of the French line. They then used modern defensive arrangements to prevent the French army's attempt to cut off the "sea route" from being realized. The German army, with eight divisions, transported by motorcycle, advanced at lightning speed, and was able to defend this 100-mile-long area, blocking the French army's pincer attacks on both sides. Later, although the British army's flanks had been wiped out, and it fought alone, it was able to successfully retreat to Dunkirk, showing that when an army fights to the death with its back to the water, even if the strength is disparate, its resistance should not be taken lightly.

I have made it very clear in my book "Defending Britain" that as for the offensive, it can be summarized in one sentence: only the offensive can occupy enemy countries or enemy positions, and force the enemy to beg for peace. To achieve this goal, the offensive occupies a major advantage psychologically. Because the offensive can maintain the initiative, and as long as the gains are commensurate with the power expended, it is nothing less than a tonic for one's own army.

But an offensive can only be adopted when the basic conditions for victory are met. At the beginning of the war, the British and French armies lacked the weapons necessary for an offensive. To adopt an offensive at that time would have been hopeless. The whole world should understand this now.

In the one or two years before the war, I advocated that we should adopt an "offensive defense." This was based on the practical principle of "doing what one can." Those in charge of preparing for war on the British and French sides mostly valued empty theories and practiced armchair strategy. Although they were logical and reasonable, they had nothing to do with the actual situation.

They did not develop the latest defensive tactics and how to implement them, and when training the army, they still focused on practicing unsuitable offensive methods, completely ignoring the word practical.

In my pre-war writings, I tried to define the necessary conditions for offense and defense. The German army carefully arranged things during the war preparation period and in the first year of the war in order to meet the conditions for successful attack, sparing no effort. The Allies were indifferent to meeting the conditions for successful defense. Comparing the two, the situation has been clearly judged. It is true that French morale was low, but the great tragedy that occurred last summer cannot be explained simply by this.

In addition to this failure to adapt to reality, the Allies' defensive efforts were hindered even more. This was not the fault of the army, but the fault of short-sighted politicians.

The safety of "defense in the West" for Britain and France depends on having a friendly Spain to protect their rear communication lines. This is a key point in my strategic defense theory. But the "non-intervention intervention policy" during the Spanish Civil War allowed Germany and Italy to dare to challenge the British navy, and allowed a faction that clearly hated Britain in the last world war to conquer the Spanish people.

To promote a collective security system to Eastern Europe, the support of the Soviet Union is essential. This is another key point in my strategic defense theory, which I have repeatedly emphasized. Unexpectedly, the British government, without first obtaining guarantees from the Soviet Union, rashly guaranteed the safety of strategically isolated Poland and Romania. This was the opposite of the policy of compromise and concession that had always been followed, and was indeed beyond the expectations of ordinary people. Once Hitler and the Soviet Union joined hands, he could have no worries about the west, and could adopt a sure-win offensive against Poland on the eastern front.

Therefore, the policies of the British and French governments completely violated the basis of the defensive strategy I advocated. They did not know how to defend by clearing the fields, which is the simplest and most effective way to frustrate the sharp edge of the attacking army, but instead gave Hitler the opportunity to break through weak points, allowing him to achieve initial victories.

What's worse is that if Britain and France wanted to fulfill their obligations and declare war, they would inevitably abandon defense and adopt an offensive in an unprepared and unfavorable situation. If they only made slight attempts against the Siegfried Line, it would be tantamount to showing their incompetence. If they attacked with all their strength, they would have to make heavy sacrifices and weaken the opportunity for future resistance.

The French army adopted a cautious offensive, which did no harm to the Siegfried Line, but because the war reports exaggerated too much, the later defeat greatly damaged the prestige of the Allied forces. In addition, the German army's blitzkrieg victory in Poland made the neutral countries more afraid of Germany and more shaken in their confidence in Britain and France than the Munich Agreement.

### Eliminating Labor-Management Disputes Requires Stabilizing Workers' Lives; Wage Increases Followed by Price Increases: The Cycle of Passing On Still Harms Workers; Economic Commentator Ares Discusses Labor Strikes

The famous economic commentator Ares published an article yesterday in the English-language "Great American Weekly," commenting on the recent labor strikes in Shanghai. He stated briefly that if the major industrialists and merchants in Shanghai continue to be as indifferent to the living conditions of workers as they have been in the past, then the occurrence of new labor-management conflicts in the future will be unavoidable. The recent transportation labor strike was mostly orchestrated by agitators. However, it would be wrong to think that the labor strike occurred entirely because of a conspiracy, because the reason why workers strike is because they are forced to make a living. During the Sino-Japanese War, Shanghai workers were never behind in patriotism. Although their income was meager, they still actively made contributions. What they are most worried about now is the rising price of rice. Rice is their main food and one of their largest monthly expenses, because the cost of buying rice each month accounts for more than half of their monthly income. Therefore, any rise in the price of rice immediately has a major adverse impact on them.

Soaring Prices Make Life Difficult to Sustain

Millions of workers in Shanghai work from sunrise to deep night, averaging about twelve to thirteen hours of work per day. However, the wages they earn per hour are less than one American cent or half a British penny. Therefore, they often find themselves in a predicament where they cannot get enough food or warm clothes. In recent years, workers' wages have increased slightly, and there have been rice subsidies. From the surface, it seems that the compensation they currently receive is more than before the war. However, their wage income has only doubled, while prices have quadrupled. Wages often fail to keep pace with the cost of living.

High Profits, Harsh Treatment

However, at a time when prices have increased and the profits of industrialists and merchants have soared to unprecedented levels, treating workers so harshly is a disgrace to Shanghai, because the profits of large industrialists and merchants are obviously obtained by exploiting workers. The proportion of workers' wages in the cost is decreasing day by day, while the profits of capitalists are increasing. The loss of the workers is the gain of the capitalists. This is indeed unforgivable. The large industrialists and merchants of all countries should be held accountable for this.

Seeking a Reasonable and Fundamental Solution

If Shanghai's large industrialists and merchants intend to avoid disputes from occurring, then they should take constructive and proactive measures to deal with this problem. We do not deny that the wages workers receive are more than last year. However, the current price of rice has increased by 30% compared to three months ago. This alone is enough to increase workers' living expenses by 20%. Wages should rise with prices to be reasonable. However, large industrialists and merchants must not raise prices after increasing wages, as a way to make up for losses in one area by gains in another, because after doing so, workers' living expenses will increase again. With increased living expenses, workers cannot sustain themselves, and then they will make demands for wage increases. This cycle continues endlessly, and those who suffer losses will ultimately be the workers. If large industrialists and merchants want to prevent this situation from recurring, they should abandon past methods.

### Philip

The "North China Daily News" reported that an official from the Upper Bureau claimed yesterday (the 22nd) that rumors that the bureau's director and president, Philip, had received threatening letters and had been the target of assassination attempts were unfounded. Mr. Philip is currently in good health. According to reports, Philip was previously assassinated, but suffered no harm and still goes to the bureau to work every day.

Public Transportation in the French Concession May Resume Today: Prolonged Insistence Will Result in Losses for Both Sides; Resume Work First, Then Discuss Conditions

After the French tram company's labor strike began on the 19th, public transportation has been completely suspended for many days, causing great inconvenience to citizens. Although the French Police Department's Political Affairs Department has repeatedly mediated, the labor side insists that work can only resume after the arrested workers are released. As a result, the rumors that the labor side would resume work and transportation would return to normal the day before yesterday turned out to be false. It is now known that the authorities have not regarded the labor strike as a stalemate, and have been working hard to mediate it in recent days. According to news obtained yesterday, the labor side also believes that a prolonged stalemate will not only result in losses for both labor and management, but also have a great impact on society. Therefore, it no longer insists on its original views, and the management is now also making concessions. The labor strike has eased. It is said that today (the 24th), the labor side will resume work first, and then labor and management will openly discuss the conditions. At the same time, after work resumes, the arrested workers will also be released at the same time. Therefore, transportation within the French Concession may resume today. As for the Chinese workers' strike at the water and electricity plant, the operation was still maintained by White Russian workers yesterday, so the supply of water and electricity in the French Concession was not affected in any way. The French police have not relaxed their vigilance in various places.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Studies Ways to Stabilize the Rice Market: Afternoon Trading in the Market Should Be Strictly Prohibited; French Ships to Send More Vessels to Transport Vietnamese Rice to Shanghai

Although the authorities of the two concessions have not yet announced specific and effective measures to stabilize the people's food, the problem is currently being studied in detail by Mr. Mitchell, the British Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Mr. Minsde, the American Director. It is said that the authorities are about to convene the people in charge of rice industry groups to discuss everything in order to implement effective measures. Regarding the aspect of clearing channels for supply, they will contact the foreign rice firms and transportation industries in this city to ensure that proper measures are obtained, so that this serious problem can be permanently stabilized.

Huge Amount of Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai

Since the authorities of the French Concession discussed increasing the number of ships to transport Vietnamese rice to Shanghai with the French shipping company and achieved satisfactory results, the number of French ships carrying rice to Shanghai has been increasing day by day. Yesterday, the Sairo arrived with 24,000 bags. According to news from the rice industry, the French shipping company's Dada Nan is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 25th). The ship is carrying as much as 70,000 bags of tribute rice.

Other ships continuing to transport rice from Vietnam to Shanghai include Jin Diya and others. The Kai Ting and Luo Si, which left this port yesterday and the day before yesterday, are also sailing to Vietnam to transport rice and grain to Shanghai.

Afternoon Trading Should Be Strictly Prohibited

When the price of rice soared last year, the Shanghai Grain Industry Association prohibited afternoon rice trading. However, speculators have relapsed and secretly traded in the afternoon. As a result, after the speculative parties fanned the flames yesterday afternoon, the black market prices in the morning became even higher. The ban should be reiterated immediately, and strict investigations and prohibitions should be carried out.

### Important Official of the Bank of Communications Robbed

According to news obtained by this newspaper this morning, an important official of the head office of the Bank of Communications in this city was kidnapped from his private residence in a certain house on Jessfield Road in Western Shanghai at about 7:00 yesterday morning. Detailed circumstances are unknown.

### Among Beggars, Many Are from Good Families; A Few Were Once Teachers and Technicians; Those with Missing Limbs Are the Most Difficult to Handle

The North-China Daily News reports that the Polish Women's League of this city recently hosted a joint committee of the Shanghai Women's League at the Polish Legation, during which Salvation Army Brigadier Ma Ruishan spoke on the issue of beggar asylums. Ma gave an overview of the asylum's history, saying that finding a suitable location was quite difficult, but eventually the current site at 11 Singapore Road was found, and operations quickly commenced.

More Than Four Hundred People, Half of Whom Are Women

The asylum now houses 451 people, including 280 women. Many of these beggars are from good families and have received education. A few were once teachers and technicians, and one even studied medicine. Blind beggars live in a separate building, where Mr. Flau and an assistant from the city's School for the Blind teach them various means of earning a living. Blind beggar children have been moved to the Hongqiao School for the Blind for care and education. The most difficult to handle are beggars with missing limbs, but they have also been assigned suitable work.

Food Supply Is Sometimes Precarious

All items brought in by beggars are kept by the asylum staff and returned when the beggars leave. The most difficult problem faced by the asylum authorities is the food supply. Maintaining each beggar requires 30 yuan per month, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the asylum to obtain rice. At one point, it was impossible to obtain rice, making it difficult to sustain operations. If the asylum authorities cannot provide food and drink, they will have to open the doors and let the beggars fend for themselves.

### Extension of Municipal Council Elections; Decision Today

The Municipal Council will receive a definite reply from the Consular Body. The Municipal Council's application to extend the deadline for the annual election of council members and the nomination of candidates for the 1941 elections (already set for noon on March 25th) by one week is currently under consideration by the Consular Body. It is widely expected that the Consular Body will reply to the Municipal Council today (24th), so that the Council can officially announce the extension of the deadline. It is generally believed that the Municipal Council is responding to the requests of foreign residents to postpone the 1941 annual election of council members from April 2nd and 3rd to April 9th and 10th. It is reported that foreign residents are currently discussing the next Council members. It is believed that if the Consular Body approves the extension of the annual election, the foreign residents will continue discussions in order to reach an understanding that will avoid the need for an election.

### Advertising Lights in the French Concession; All Suspended; Effective Today

Since the Public Concession implemented electricity conservation measures, the French Concession authorities have also considered this issue several times. The Municipal Council has now decided to advise residents in the Concession to conserve electricity. In the past few days, personnel have been dispatched to investigate advertising lights, such as neon lights, in various businesses within the Concession, and the investigation has been completed. It is now known that starting today, all advertising lights of shops in the French Concession that the authorities deem to consume excessive electricity will be prohibited.

### Providing Flour to Relieve Food Shortages; Meritorious Service to Society; More Than Five Thousand Bags Distributed Daily at Cost

Amid rampant rice speculation and soaring black market prices, the food problem has reached a critical point, threatening overall social stability. One thing deserves public praise and should be commended for its encouraging effect: the sale of flour at fair prices, which has been relied upon in recent years to relieve the food crisis for ordinary people. The sale of flour at fair prices was initiated by the Chinese-owned Fufeng and Fuxin factories in 1929. It was then publicly sold at fair prices in January 1940. Except for occasional suspensions due to interruptions in raw material supplies, it continues to this day.

Continuing Fair Price Sales

Currently, the Fufeng factory provides 1,059 bags of flour for fair price sales. Although raw material supplies have been interrupted and temporarily suspended, the Fuxin factory still distributes 5,873 bags of flour daily (the Municipal Council supplements this by 8,318 bags of foreign flour daily, five days a week, which are distributed to various stalls, restaurants, and bakeries).

The fair price is only the cost of 25 yuan per bag, which is 7 or 8 yuan less than the market price of 32 or 33 yuan per bag. Based on the current supply of 250,000 bags of foreign wheat flour,

Sacrificing Profits

The loss of profits is close to 2 million yuan. Although the factory can continue to supply flour at fair prices until late April, it is still negotiating to procure American wheat in order to continue supplying flour until the new wheat arrives. Fuxin is shouldering this huge responsibility alone, and the factory manager, Mr. Wang Yuqing, is managing the difficulties and benefiting the common people. This is a rare and great undertaking in this isolated island. Therefore, Mr. Fei, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, and Mr. He, the Chinese Director-General, have repeatedly commended him. A certain Western newspaper even praised it as a

Great Achievement

And said that in addition to his efforts to sell flour at fair prices, Mr. Wang has also made advance payments and donations to help stabilize rice prices. His achievements are indeed indelible. The recent drop in flour prices is a direct result of the fair price flour sales. Even the rice market, which is so severe, has not experienced any significant incidents, which is also deeply related to the fair price flour sales. This is because 30% of Shanghai's more than 4 million residents are Northern compatriots and overseas Chinese, all of whom rely on flour for their livelihood.

### Fundraising for the Bank Employee Shooting Case; The Zhengyan Newspaper Donates 1,000 Yuan to Start the Effort; While Seeking to Rescue the Kidnapped Bank Employees

On the night of the 21st of this month, in the dormitory of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank employees on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, thugs broke in, forced the employees to line up, and opened fire, killing six people on the spot and one person who died after being sent to the hospital. This resulted in the "March 21st" tragedy. Less than three hours after this tragedy, more than one hundred employees of the Bank of China were kidnapped at No. 96 Jessfield Road. Everyone has parents, wives, and children. How can they bear this? The Zhengyan Newspaper has initiated a fundraising effort of 100,000 yuan to provide compensation to the families of the victims of the "March 21st" tragedy and has taken the lead by donating 1,000 yuan. People from China and abroad are expected to sympathize. The Jiangsu Farmers Bank will be the collection agency, and the newspaper will publish the list of donors. At the same time, efforts will be made to rescue the kidnapped Bank of China employees and to prevent the recurrence of such tragedies.

Improving Condition

In addition to the six Jiangsu Farmers Bank employees who died on the spot from gunshot wounds—Chu Hualong, Xue Yushan, Zhang Shaozhen, Fan Jingjiang, Wan Deyi, and Dai Daguan—Xi Shen also died after being sent to the Guangci Hospital. The four seriously injured—Cheng Xiuming, Li Yawen, Zhang Shusen, and Shen Yongzuo—are still being treated at the Guangci Hospital. It is reported that after the doctors performed surgery, their condition has improved and their lives are expected to be saved.

Strict Protection

It is also reported that after the kidnapping of employees at the Bank of China's dormitory on Jessfield Road on the same night, some of the employees have been released. It is said that those who were released were mistakenly kidnapped. The French police have stationed two armored vehicles, numbers 25 and 30, in front of the bank's Avenue Joffre branch for strict protection. The Public Concession police have also dispatched detectives to guard the branches of the bank to provide protection.

Suspicious Car Found

Yesterday morning around 1 a.m., a green car suddenly parked for a long time in front of the Bank of China's Xinzha Road office at No. 420 Xinzha Road in the Public Concession. The detective stationed there suspected something was wrong and intended to question the driver, but the driver suddenly sped away. The detective later reported the information to the police station.

### I Think of Three Three Four

— Qiu Xifu

I'm afraid many pedestrians haven't noticed that near the foot of the western wall outside the entrance of the racecourse on Bubbling Well Road stands a milestone about two feet tall. Engraved on it is a line of English which reads: "One mile to the Bund from here."

Boarding a public bus, one glance reveals about twenty or so people in the carriage. Everyone is lazily leaning against the seatback, the bus rattling noisily, even the joints in the bones are being shaken. The bus travels only seven or eight minutes, conquering the mile long distance.

The statue of Chabrier at the Nanjing Road end of the Bund is mottled and speckled from head to foot, from a distance it appears to be draped in a fuzzy sort of fur coat, not colorful, but very apt for the time of year. This "iron heart" also decorates the spring scenery beside the Huangpu River.

Outside the park entrance, the most striking, lively and moving things are the public phone booths. A splash of red color, those who don't know might suspect they're small fire stations.

Between not-three-not-four o'clock (the customs clock at three, my watch at four) I spent six five-cent pieces, and stepped into the Bund Park. To the right, a pair of little clay figures are holding umbrellas on the artificial hill, appearing to be sheltering from the rain. In reality, if it were really raining, they would be the first to need a change of clothes. As we're "old acquaintances," I won't be too critical of the children!

Turning to walk to a big altar on the left, a small wooden block declares "Single Earlrz Tulip." The purple-orchid colored ones, and the blue-yellow-red intermingled ones, are arranged sparsely and clearly. Because they've only just been watered by the gardener, the surrounding soil is still moist and rich, bring your nose closer and you can feel a breath of fresh air seeping from the soil, evaporated by the sunlight. It seems it can be named the "earthy breath of spring," and relaxes the chest.

Raising my head, I look afar at the vehicles and pedestrians on the Garden Bridge busily coming and going; the big and small steamers on the Huangpu River, belching black smoke, the gray warships… everything seems to have leaped out of the constraints of time, utterly "unchanging." My head throbs again.

Only minding to saunter forwards, I clearly see several pairs of young men and women scattered over the chairs, however, who still has the enthusiasm to go and observe them? Each of the chairs is connected in a long row, section by section like a large string of sausages. Fat ones, thin ones, after having been blown by the river breeze and illuminated by the sunshine warm yet tinged with heat, although they won't all necessarily be sweating, that everyone's face is coated in oiliness is, however, a fact.

Unawares, I walked to the northeast corner, to a flat and wide cement platform, where a line of six or seven rattan tables have been placed, seated around which are two, three, four, five, people, inconsistently. Half Western, half Chinese, wearing clothes of different ranks. The most arresting thing is a Westerner sticking out his large belly. Other than his upper clothes, he only wears a vest, a cigar is clamped in his mouth, and he's playing cards with a thin, lanky man. The two of them are sitting opposite each other, draped their taken-off clothes on the backs of the empty chairs in-between them. The two heads will now and again incline together, almost touching; but then they split apart as if estranged, hugging the chair backs, heads raised. Hands gripping the cards, raised high before the eyes. The distance between the two heads is fully half a丈 away, and so the upper bodies again bend and soften downwards, like candles lit on a hot day, and unconsciously the bodies stretch down, and three cards, two cards at a time are spread and slapped down on the table. In such a process of wavering instability, the two people are, however, wordlessly silent. Like they are rushing to complete some task that they aren't necessarily interested in but have to in some period of time.

Leaning on the corner, beside the table of a forty-something year old woman who is a half-caste Westerner, when the waiter came with drinks, I asked about the background of the two card playing Westerners.

"Hmph… Jews!" A very unnatural sounding reply. Going on, I also asked:

"They look like regular customers?" "Spending three mao for a cup of tea (sugar and milk included), that table is sold to them the whole day."

It was not necessary to ask further, that waiter grumbled again for a while.

At the table one table over to the right are two special constables, the number on one of the epaulettes is a triple-number, a glance at it and it is easy to remember, that aside. On the table are two Sarsae soft drink bottles. One gulp remains in a glass. The two button their collars, straighten their uniforms, and swagger away. Following that, there came a Westerner carrying a large leather bag in his right hand, and a rectangular box tucked under his left arm. The grease stain on his hat was almost like summer asphalt, and the leather shoes on his feet were unquestionably the valiant performers of a journey of ten thousand li. He brushed past the plump Western woman seated before my seat, and walked to the seat where the two constables had been. He put down the big leather bag with one hand, and at once tossed the glass that was left with one gulp of Sarsae soft drink to his mouth.

With a Chaplin-esque, strained smile faintly floating on his face, he put down the box, took off his coat, and slumped down. He glanced around, and gave a nod or a shake of the head as if greeting the plump woman beside him. After two minutes, he stood up and walked to the candy counter inside, and bought a Tom Boy brand chocolate bar for three mao. And he requested a half-glass of free filtered water. The two hands gripping this "source of life," he returned to his original seat. Drinking cool water, biting chocolate, the smile floating on his face, little by little, changed from dry and moist, and diffused from the local territory of the ends of the eyebrows and eyes to the entire head. I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness in my heart, looking at the timepiece on my wrist, it was precisely four and a half o'clock daylight savings time, ah!

The plump Westerner was wearing dark green upper clothes, and a brownish-grey skirt. There were two pockets beside the waist, all zippered, five or six inches long. On the table was a black leather bag, swollen to almost the same size as its owner's body. She first took out a small mirror, and held it before her face, looking at it again and again. And she applied her blood-red lipstick endlessly. The redder the lips, the more terrible the two dark circles around her eyes appeared. However, the Westerner beside her, had emptied his glass of cool water, and the chocolate had disappeared. As if he'd eaten a grand meal of seven or eight courses, he appeared very satisfied, and with a slouched posture, expressed a desiring look. He began to chat with this "pious-type" of woman. As a result, this Westerner pulled a business card out of her leather bag to show him, and without a doubt told him her address and name.

The time they talked for was not short, I saw two Indians, one with a bright peach-colored silk scarf wrapped around his head, one with a yellow one, the two were circling the park, and had probably passed the platform three times already. The man carrying the big leather bag only then cordially took his leave of the plump woman. At this time, another three or four American sailors came, and several Western men and women, the sailors were taking pictures, each full of vigor, smiles on their faces, but on the look of it, it always felt that their uniforms were too narrow, the muscles all over their bodies were almost about to burst out of the clothes.

I left the place for tea, went around the outdoor pavilion circled by short trees on the right, and on a small lawn, I saw two Western girls, and a middle-aged man, frolicking and playing there, after pushing each other around for a while they laughed uncontrollably. Two Chinese women, and a richly dressed young woman passed by, they walked calmly on the lawn, with a slight smile on their faces, as if they were pointing at the two Western girls, and criticizing something with a smirk. The impression given by these three women, was exactly like three tins of tinned fruit, their own color, fragrance, and flavor were all locked up inside, and the beautiful decoration on the surface was not at all their own. (To be continued)

Bund Crowd Scenes

This scene is from the point of view of the "Peace Statue," and is a panorama of the Bund looking south to north, the main buildings have all been collected here, the HSBC building is like a bald old man, full of veteran power. The customs clock is like a lanky guy, his voice especially loud. The Bank of China Building beside the Cathay Hotel, is now near to completion, and is half a head taller than the "Sassoon's" skullcap.

### Speculative Coal Merchants Continue to Ravage the Market; Disregarding Authorities' Public Notices and Raising Prices for Profit; Stockpiles Are Full and Sources Are Still Open

After the market for various types of briquettes and lump coal in this city has been quietly manipulated and monopolized by one or two large coal companies, the market is worsening day by day. In addition, the appetite of general businesses is quite strong, and the small amount of spot goods on the market cannot meet the balance of supply and demand. People's hearts are extremely volatile, and market prices are rising. Among them, the price of bituminous coal dust has risen the most sharply. For example, Hongji No. 2 dust has risen to 178 yuan per ton, Indian dust requires 250 yuan, and Kai Ping dust is 120 yuan (factory price). The coal price has risen so high because speculative coal merchants are manipulating and monopolizing the market. The authorities' punishment of speculative coal merchants cannot be delayed any longer. Otherwise, the future of the coal market will continue to deteriorate. The one or two large coal companies are wantonly ravaging the market, hoping to raise prices for profit, and are turning a blind eye to external circumstances and the authorities' public notices. They are also falsely claiming that the goods in their warehouses have been sold to various businesses after they are completed, while at the same time refusing to stockpile goods for the market.

Dispatching Cables to Various Places; Coal by the Kilo Shipped to Shanghai

Regarding the shipping of foreign coal, the authorities of the two concessions have tried to dredge the canal. In addition to sending cables to the governments of coal-producing areas such as India and Vietnam to release large quantities of bituminous coal, briquettes and dust to Shanghai, coal ships are also being loaded one after another in an attempt to ship large quantities of coal to Shanghai to balance and stabilize the market. Therefore, there is no risk of interruption to the source of bituminous coal. According to coal industry sources, the coal stockpiles in the Pudong, Hongkou, and western Shanghai areas of the city are still extremely abundant, estimated to be more than 400,000 tons, enough for three and a half months of fuel for the city's various industries and residents. The daily arrivals in recent days are enough for daily use. Therefore, the abundance of coal stockpiles is undeniable.

Quantity of Coal Shipped to Shanghai Last Month

A New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the Jianghai Customs yesterday that the customs has completed its statistics on the quantity of foreign coal shipped to Shanghai from abroad in February of this year, totaling 92,559 metric tons, worth 744,804 gold units, equivalent to 2,016,184 yuan in national currency. Among them, Vietnam accounted for the most, with 30,159 metric tons, worth 367,361 gold units. Japan was second, with 25,763 metric tons, worth 77,743 gold units. Taiwan was third, with 20,713 metric tons, worth 62,764 gold units. British India was fourth, with 15,912 metric tons, worth 236,808 gold units. Therefore, the claim that the source of coal is blocked is purely unfounded.

### Secondhand Shop Owner Shot to Death

Wang Tinglong, the owner of a secondhand shop at No. 322 Pingliang Road, Fulan Road, Yangshupu, was suddenly attacked by a person who broke into his shop at 8:20 p.m. last night. Without asking for any reason, the person pulled out a firearm and fired several shots at him, hitting vital parts of his body and killing him on the spot. The murderer, seeing that the purpose had been achieved, fled with the weapon. After the family reported to the police, the body was taken to the Hudong Hospital and then to the coroner's office for examination.

### Silk Shop Robbery; One Injured, One Captured; Two Handguns Seized

At approximately 6:30 p.m. yesterday, four robbers armed with handguns broke into a certain silk shop at No. 62 South Wuxi Road and ordered everyone not to make a sound, intending to search and rob the shop. Fortunately, the owner was alert and immediately called the Laozha Police Station. Chinese and foreign police officers were dispatched in a car and bravely entered the shop. As a result, one robber was captured alive, and one robber was shot in the chest and shoulder and fell to the ground. Two guns were seized. The remaining two robbers managed to escape. The injured robber was taken by ambulance to the police hospital for treatment. It is reported that the silk shop suffered only minor losses.

### Bomb Thrown in Kunshan Garden; Exploded on the Spot, Fortunately No One Was Injured

At around 9 p.m. last night, someone threw a grenade into the Kunshan Garden in Hongkou, causing a loud explosion that resonated far and wide. The grenade landed on wasteland, fortunately without injuring anyone or damaging any property. The resident police officer in the garden, Wan Shun, reported the information to the police station, who ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They took the shell and shrapnel back to the police station for destruction and are investigating the perpetrator to bring them to justice.

### Mitsui Bussan Lumberyard Set on Fire

The North-China Daily News reports that at 1:05 a.m. yesterday (the 22nd), phosphorus was thrown over the fence into the Mitsui Bussan Lumberyard at No. 2180 Yangshupu Road, causing a pile of lumber to catch fire. Firefighters from the Yangshupu Fire Brigade were called, but the fire had already been extinguished by people in the lumberyard using water and sand. The damage was not severe. It is believed that someone attempted to commit arson.

### Russian Children Search for Bird Eggs; Knock Over Tombstone; Detained by "City Police"

The North-China Daily News reports that on Thursday afternoon of last week, four Russian children (the oldest only 16 years old) in the Hongqiao area were searching for bird nests and eggs when they knocked over a tombstone in a cemetery. They were detained by the "City Police" and taken to the Lincoln Road police station. It is reported that they were beaten and have not yet been released. Upon hearing this, Mr. Ivanov, the chairman of the White Russian Immigrant Committee in this city, met with the "City" officials, who promised to pay attention to the matter. It is hoped that the four children will be released soon.

### Yixin Dyeing Factory Also Destroyed by Workers; Twelve Workers Arrested; Currently Being Mediated by the French Political Department

Huaguang News Agency reports that due to the failure of workers in the dyeing and weaving industry in this city to obtain subsidies from the management in the early part of the month, all workers declared a strike. However, the workers of the Meifeng Dyeing Factory at No. 112 Binlang Road continued to work as usual and were unwilling to respond to the strike. Hundreds of members of the dyeing and weaving workers' union considered the Meifeng Factory workers to be deliberately undermining the unity of the strike and gathered at the factory, destroying machinery. Afterwards, the manager of the factory, Que Pingzhi, reported to the police station, who dispatched a large number of detectives and arrested 57 workers, who were sent to the Special First Court and sentenced to ten days of detention. Unexpectedly, a similar incident occurred at the Yixin Dyeing Factory at No. 1, Lane 380 Kangti Road in the French Concession the day before yesterday. More than one hundred striking workers broke into the factory and destroyed most of the machinery. Afterwards, the manager of the factory, Yan Youli (30 years old, local), reported to the French police station, who dispatched a large number of detectives and arrested the workers on the spot: Cui Changfa, Tang Shengtian, Chen Changsheng, Wang Shigen, Ma Changgen, Long Er, Huang Shoukang, Zhou Zhaogen, Yu Jinguan, Ma Arong, Hua Huosheng, and Li Bingsheng. The workers were all taken to the police station for detention. Afterwards, the French Political Department and the industry's workers' union came forward to mediate. The workers demanded that the factory be responsible for bailing out the twelve arrested workers. Although the manager of the Yixin Dyeing Factory, Yan Youli, can waive the criminal charges, he proposed that the workers must compensate for the loss of the destroyed machinery. Therefore, the case is still deadlocked between the two sides. The strike of all workers in the dyeing industry has not yet been resolved and is currently being actively mediated.

### Miscellaneous News from All Circles

### The Crisis of Japanese Finance

Everyone knows that Japanese finance is a strong-looking but weak-inside country in peacetime. Now that the Sino-Japanese War has been going on for three years and seven months, Japanese finance is becoming increasingly difficult, which is undeniable. At this point, when they are at the end of their rope, they even pass an unprecedentedly huge budget and still want to struggle, brazenly advancing south in an attempt to make a last-ditch effort. However, they are terminally ill and there is nothing they can do but accelerate the date of their collapse. Now, let us review its past evolution and future trends.

The first financial crisis Japan encountered in its history was during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. At that time, Japan spent 2 billion yen in military expenses to defeat Imperial Russia. However, Japan could not fully bear this huge amount, so Japan's finances were in an unsustainable situation. Finally, Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo went to the United States and used the joint development of Manchuria and Mongolia and the operation of the South Manchurian Railway as bait to lure American capitalists to purchase its public bonds. As a result, nearly 1 billion yen of military expenses were underwritten by the United States, which helped them to overcome the difficulties.

After the "September 18th" Incident in 1931, the second financial crisis in Japan gradually began again. Originally, the expansion of the military budget was simply like a hot air balloon, a little  affected. We see that in 1931, the total amount of Japan's financial expenditure was only 1.476 billion yen, of which military expenditure accounted for only 31% (454 million yen). However, in the following year of the incident, it jumped to 1.95 billion yen, and the amount of military expenditure increased to 686 million yen. By 1933, its financial budget exceeded the 2 billion yen mark (2.254 billion yen), and the proportion of military expenditure also increased from 31% to 39%. This is such an alarming increase!

After 1933, Japan's annual financial budget continued to increase like a flying rocket. In 1936, it increased to 2.3 billion yen, setting a new record in the country's financial history! People from all walks of life in the country were all frightened and angry. The cabinet was therefore replaced many times. As a result, after repeated reductions, it was still 2.8 billion yen, of which military expenditure accounted for 1.4 billion yen, almost reaching half of the total budget.

However, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred in July 1937. In order to increase military expenditure, Japan specially submitted a war budget of 500 million yen to the parliament, thinking that it could solve the war and achieve the goal of conquering China. Who knew that the "August 13th" War broke out and evolved into a full-scale war. The huge war expenses could not be borne by the ordinary accounting budget, so they simply separated the war expense budget and compiled another type of budget, which is what they called the special accounting budget (referred to as the China Incident Expense). In September, they added 2 billion yen to the parliament. Then, the ordinary accounting budget for 1937 was 2.8 billion yen, and the special budget was 2.5 billion yen, totaling 5.3 billion yen.

By 1938, the ordinary accounting budget was also 2.8 billion yen, but the special accounting budget expanded to 4.8 billion yen, plus three additional budgets of 640 million yen, totaling 8.3 billion yen, an increase of more than one and a half times compared with the 1937 figure. In 1939, the ordinary accounting budget was 4.8 billion yen, an increase of 2 billion yen over the previous year, and the special accounting budget was 4.6 billion yen, totaling 9.4 billion yen. By 1940, the ordinary accounting budget was 5.823 billion yen, an increase of about 1 billion yen over the previous year, and the special accounting budget was 4.46 billion yen, totaling 10.3 billion yen. The huge amount, although it cannot be said to be unprecedented, can also be said to be the first of its kind. Just taking the special accounting budget as an example, it increased by 11 times compared with the special accounting budget during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, and increased by as much as 82 times compared with the special accounting budget during the "January 28th" Sino-Japanese War.

As for Japan's 1941 budget, it was passed by the parliament on December 10 of the previous year. According to the published estimate, the total amount of the ordinary accounting budget reached 6.863 billion yen, an increase of 1.04 billion yen compared with the ordinary accounting budget amount of the previous year. This figure is naturally unprecedentedly large in Japanese financial history. The special accounting budget is 4.88 billion yen, and the ordinary accounting budget has reached a huge amount of 11.74 billion yen, which is an increase of ten times compared with Japan twenty years ago. But at that time, it was the peak of Japan's prosperity, but now it has reached the extreme of poverty. However, the huge amount of money is a huge problem for the authorities in the future.

Due to the continuous expansion of Japan's annual military expenditure, the source of financial income has to be distributed to the national people, and it is impossible to keep pace with the military expenditure. Therefore, Japanese finance has to take the path of issuing national debt, that is, so-called deficit public bonds, increasing taxes, and issuing banknotes. From then on, Japanese finance exposed a deformed state. Originally, the main part of the expenditure was military expenditure, the second part was national debt expenditure, and the rest was other expenditure. What about the income? Tax revenue accounts for half, and loans and miscellaneous income also account for half. In short, there is no difference in what is taken from the Japanese people.

Although Japan's foreign debt is decreasing year by year, its internal debt is increasing by leaps and bounds. In 1926, Japan's public debt was only 5.00162 billion yen, and in 1931, it was only 6.187 billion yen. However, by 1936, the total public debt broke the 10 billion yen mark. In 1937, Japan decided to issue 800 million yen of public debt (originally 960 million yen, but later reduced by 160 million yen). After the "July 7th" Incident, Japan additionally issued 410 million yen of public debt. Later, the temporary parliament passed more than 2 billion yen of the "China Incident Expense." In this way, the total amount of Japan's national debt has actually been close to 14 billion yen, equivalent to the total national income.

In 1938, 4.45 billion yen of the special accounting budget of 4.8 billion yen was also dependent on public debt. The public debt part of the ordinary accounting budget in 1938 was 866 million yen, totaling 5.316 billion yen, plus 1.49 billion yen that had not been issued in 1937. Then, the amount to be issued in 1938 was as much as 6.8 billion yen. Statistics show that the total amount of Japanese public debt has reached 10 billion yen. Since then, Japanese public debt has increased rather than decreased. As of the end of November last year, the accumulated amount of public debt reached about 26.9 billion yen. Moreover, 3.997 billion yen of the 4.88 billion yen in the special accounting budget for this year (1941-42) is issued in public debt. Therefore, there is no doubt that the amount of Japanese public debt issued will increase rather than decrease in the future. However, according to the former famous Japanese Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo, "The saturation point of Japanese public debt cannot exceed 10 billion yen." Now it has exceeded the limit by about three times, which shows that its financial difficulties are deepening day by day, and the financial crisis is also exposed.

As for the issuance routes of Japanese public debt, there are two: one is through banks, which sell them to the people, and the amount that can be sold is advanced by the bank; the other is through the Deposit Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, which uses the deposit and postal deposits accepted by the bureau to digest them. However, the current amount of Japanese public debt issued has reached the saturation point, which can be seen from the following facts. Originally, the amount of public debt that Japan had repeatedly planned to issue in recent years, the actual number of issues, has not reached the budgeted number, and the decoupling of the public debt cycle has also been exposed. The promotion of public debt, due to the exhaustion of national economic power, cannot be fully accepted, that is, the banks themselves cannot fully digest it. Here is an example to illustrate that last year, the amount of Japanese public debt issued was 6.665 billion yen, of which 1.85 billion yen was distributed by the Deposit Bureau of the Ministry of Finance; of which 4.815 billion yen was distributed by banks; as a result, a total of 4.838 billion yen was digested, accounting for 72% of the issued amount. What about this year? The ordinary accounting budget reached 6.863 billion yen, which is 1.04 billion yen more than the previous year. If there is another one or two additional budgets, based on the previous year, about 300 million yen, then the ordinary accounting budget will definitely reach 13 billion yen, breaking the highest record in previous years. As for the special accounting budget, it is 4.88 billion yen, which is 420 million yen more than the previous year. Therefore, the total of the two budgets in Japan this year is 1.7 billion yen more than the previous year, and the amount of public debt to be issued this year will inevitably reach 8 billion yen. In the state of national poverty and exhaustion, whether public debt can be issued in large quantities has become a major question. Moreover, Japan still has 5 billion yen of public debt accumulated in the treasury of the Ministry of Finance, and 1.8 billion yen could not be digested last year, so it is conceivable that the unsale rate this year will be even greater.

The second method for Japan to cope with the huge expenditure is to increase taxes, but the increase in tax revenue is not the growth of the people's ability to pay taxes. In fact, it is a general increase in various tax rates in the tax department. Every time the annual budget expands, the Japanese financial authorities have to increase taxes once. Since the "July 7th" Incident, Japan has implemented four large-scale tax increases. I remember a newspaper reporter once said a joke, saying that "Now in Japan, perhaps only the air is not taxed." In fact, this sentence is not a joke, but it shows that Japan's tax increase is already exhausted. Originally, the new tax passed by the 75th Parliament also included taxes on chafer beetles. It seems that in the past four years, the annual tax burden of the Japanese people has been impossible.

On the other hand, it is futile to issue 6 billion yen of public debt and attempt to increase tax revenue by 500 million yen to make up for it. Moreover, increasing taxes is often more troublesome in legislative and administrative procedures, and the results obtained are not as great as issuing public debt and issuing banknotes. Therefore, at the current stage, the Japanese financial authorities have adopted a policy of issuing public debt and banknotes at the same time in order to make up for the huge expenditure.

The increase in public debt is the advance payment of the future income of the people. Therefore, the larger the amount of public debt issued, the greater the debt of each citizen. As for increasing taxes, it is biased towards the burden of the working masses, and it will not reduce the wealth of the wealthy people. In addition to public debt and tax increases, Japan also has to increase the issuance of banknotes to cope with the huge expenditure. We can get a glimpse of the process of Japanese banknote inflation from the following figures.

Before the war, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan was no more than 1.64 billion yen at the end of June 1937. By the end of the same year, it had increased to 2.305 billion yen, an increase of 665 million yen in six months. In 1938, the highest amount reached 2.755 billion yen. In 1939, it rose to an unprecedented figure of 3.817 billion yen, and naturally about 500 to 600 million yen were returned to the Bank of Japan. Therefore, at the end of January last year, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan was reduced to 3.27 billion yen. Afterwards, due to the magic of finance, by the end of November, it had increased to 3.75 billion yen, and by the end of December, it had reached 4.817 billion yen. However, the actual number is more than this, because after the implementation of the old convertible note reorganization law and the expansion of the guarantee money of the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Taiwan in April last year, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan in May increased by 115 million yen compared with the previous year's figure. Therefore, as of the end of last year, the total amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan has reached 3.932 billion yen, which is an increase of nearly one and a half times compared with the 1.64 billion yen before the war.

Japan, regardless of the amount of reserves, desperately issuing banknotes, will naturally cause malignant inflation, stimulating price increases, making people's lives more and more difficult. The rise in prices is the inevitable result of currency inflation and tax increases. How high are Japanese prices? According to Katsuta Sadatsugu, a Japanese, "This year, Japanese prices have risen at least three times compared with the previous year, but Japanese prices in the previous year were already three times higher than before the war, so Japanese prices now are at least nine times higher than usual." Due to the rise in prices, the national life will become more and more painful, thus affecting the health of the people.

At present, the Japanese financial authorities are trying to make public debt digestion smooth in order to avoid malignant currency inflation. The main methods for digesting public debt are nothing more than encouraging savings and restricting loans, so that the banking industry can buy public debt as much as possible. However, we know that under the heavy pressure of layers of heavy taxes and high prices, where can the Japanese people have spare money to save? The people's livelihood has become extremely difficult, and the national economy is declining along with the general economic decline, and bank deposits are even more reduced. In the past, the authorities used the deposits of various banks to purchase public debt. At that time, in order to obtain greater profits, the banks naturally wanted to undertake loans. Who knew that after the war, the wartime fund adjustment law was promulgated, depriving the banks of the right to freely lend, trying to encourage the people to save as much as possible in order to increase the deposits of the banks. Now, the bank deposits have decreased instead, making it more difficult to digest public debt. Not only can it not compress currency inflation, but it will also suffer from it even more. Therefore, Japan's national power is exhausted, and even if it drains the pond to get all the fish, it may not be able to cope with the unprecedented budget. When that time comes, the public debt cannot be digested, and it can only issue banknotes to fill the war expenses. The result will not only promote its financial bankruptcy, but also the inability to continue the war and the failure is predictable.

### Things Seen, Heard, and Thought About

It is said that starting in 1941, Chinese bankers will designate March 22 as "Banker's Day" and fly half-mast flags on that day to express their grief.

Historians who study the history of the Shanghai rice market in the future will definitely use important chapters to describe the "Yu Family Rice Account" and the "Three Households" on the account.

### The Problem of Liquid Fuels in England and Germany

— Nong

"A drop of kerosene is more precious than a drop of human blood!" The heart-stirring famous saying of the famous German general Hindenburg must still be lingering in our minds, right? Those national leaders who are concerned about the security of their own countries have always been eager to develop kerosene, study its substitutes, purchase it, and store it, fearing to fall behind. There is no need to explain this any further. This long-term competition between England and Germany is certainly not yet known who will win, but whether the storage of liquid fuel is sufficient or not, and whether the subsequent supply and replenishment are difficult or not, will undoubtedly be one of the important factors in determining the outcome.

According to statistics: Before the war, the average annual consumption of kerosene and kerosene products in the United Kingdom was 12 million tons; Germany's consumption was smaller, but it also needed 6 million tons. The consumption of liquid fuel during the war will certainly far exceed this number, and it is quite difficult to estimate. Dr. Steinberg of Germany estimated that Germany should consume 12 million to 3 million tons of liquid fuel in a year of war, according to the degree of mechanization in Germany at the beginning of the war. However, under the mass production and vigorous production of airplanes, submarines, and tanks, who can know what stage it will need to reach in the future? England should consume 24 million to 6 million tons in a year of war if it uses twice as much as usual. England needs to import almost all of it from other places. According to the Romanian government's report in 1937, the kerosene production in Germany in that year was 486,000 tons, and according to the monthly statistical report of the International Federation, the kerosene production in Germany in 1939 was only 700,000 tons. Compared with the huge number needed during the war, it is really small! Therefore, the urgent situation of Germany and England needing to obtain enough liquid fuel from foreign countries or other methods is only a difference of ninety steps and one hundred steps!

Looking around the countries in the world that produce the most kerosene, according to the monthly statistical report of the League of Nations, the production from July 1938 to June 1939: (tons)

In addition to its own use, the Soviet Union's kerosene production is about 10 million tons, which can be supplied to belligerent countries or other neutral countries; Romania and Poland can also supply a part; however, this is still far from the number of kerosene actually needed by the two belligerent countries: where can this shortfall be compensated? The number that can be made up for by the Asian producing areas is quite considerable, but the one with the highest production in the world, which can be taken endlessly and used exhaustively, is neither British nor American. When it comes to the preparation of liquid fuel by the two countries before the war, England has its entire and systematic plan: British Borneo, India, Burma, and Malaya produce 18 million tons annually, and eight or nine out of ten are in England's bag. There is no need to calculate, that is, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Iran and the Khanna and Iraq Two Oil Companies in Iraq are all operated by the British; almost 14 million tons of it are infused into England every year. England usually fraternizes with Romania, the world's fourth-largest oil-producing country, and most of the Romanian kerosene is also searched and purchased by England. Therefore, although England itself does not produce a drop of kerosene (?), she is like a large hoarding merchant who embraces a lot of kerosene. What's more, she relies on her abundant financial resources, a tight transportation network, and all-pervasive commerce and investment, and she does not rely on the oil of Venezuela, the world's third-largest oil-producing country, to supply her. Even other small oil-producing areas have her footprints everywhere. Now, she has the United States, which holds the world's kerosene production championship, as her shield, so there is no problem with the supply and replenishment of liquid fuel.

What about Germany? Comparing it with England, it is inevitable to feel ashamed! Its own production is at most 700,000 tons per year: it does not have overseas territories like British India and Burma, nor does it have large-scale oil mine investments like England in Iran and Iraq, nor does it have a large amount of cash as an advance payment for purchasing oil from overseas! Germany's foreign trade is based on the principle of "barter." This can only be exchanged for the largest amount of kerosene from Romania, but its effectiveness for other oil-producing countries will inevitably be greatly discounted. (To be continued)

### North and South Goods: Dried Longan Supply Interrupted

Dried Longan: The Xinghua-Quanzhou shipping route is reported to be interrupted again, naturally leading to a temporary shortage of supply. Theoretically, the market price may increase. However, the amount of goods arriving earlier was not small, and coupled with the prolonged sluggish sales from various regions, the quoted prices have shown a decline again. Checking the retail prices in this city, due to the high initial market price, although the purchase price has now decreased, the reduction in retail price is limited. The limited sales in this city are not without reason. It is rumored that major players in the industry plan to sell large quantities at low prices, hoping that the Shanghai people will have a widespread trial, with the aim of breaking the high-profit principle.

### Yarn and Cotton: American Cotton Calm

New York American Cotton Telegraph: Market conditions are calm. At closing, prices fell due to Southern merchants short selling and long positions being sold, resulting in a fall of three to four points in both futures and spot prices.

Bombay Indian Cotton: Prices fell due to the closing of long positions, but rebounded due to buyers increasing their orders. As a result, except for White Raw cotton for far-term delivery rising one rupee, all other varieties fell two to three rupees. It is predicted that the opening price tomorrow will increase by three rupees.

United States Cotton Industry Statistics

Washington Telegraph: The Bureau of Statistics released the American cotton industry statistics for February, as recorded in the original telegram:

Cotton Consumption for Clothing: 794,000 bales

Cotton Consumption for Seeds: 107,000 bales

Cotton Exports for Clothing: 61,000 bales

Cotton Inventory in Factories: 1,905,000 bales

Cotton Inventory in Warehouses: 14,029,000 bales

Number of Spindles: 22,769,000

### Miscellaneous Items: Cigarette Sales Sluggish

Cigarette prices have been trending downward for several days because most sales channels cannot transport goods for export. Factories are distributing goods according to regulations, which are warehoused. Transactions among merchants are sluggish, making it difficult for prices to rise. For example, British Brand is 1,396 yuan, Old Knife Brand is 932 yuan, Pin Hai Brand is 867 yuan, Five Hua Brand is 674 yuan, and Little Fairy Brand is 666 yuan. The purchase prices of Hua Cheng’s Beautiful Golden Mouse brands remain stable. The prices of high-quality cigarettes are scarce and tight. For example, ten-pack Great Front Gate Brand is 388 yuan per 10,000 cigarettes.

### Piece Goods: Ramie and Cambric Cloth Experience Significant Transactions

Ramie and cambric cloth from the West, especially Sanjiang Lanling, is quite scarce, with a quoted selling price of 17-18 yuan per yard, but there is business with no goods. Ramie and cambric cloth from our own factories, particularly Yongcheng and Lianxin, have seen a large number of spot and forward transactions. Yongcheng white ramie and cambric cloth is selling at 1.95 yuan per batch, beige at 1.85 yuan, Lianxin gray at 2.30 yuan, white at 1.10 yuan, and beige at 2.00 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Bitter Apricot Kernels Remain Depressed

The price of bitter apricot kernels has remained depressed recently due to a relatively large amount in stock. Market prices have been declining since last winter, mainly due to sluggish sales in various regions and a lack of large-scale demand. Yesterday, white-skinned bitter apricot kernels were sold at 85 yuan, and red-skinned at 82 yuan. There are currently no prospects for improvement, and a rebound may only be possible after sales pick up.

### Sweet Potatoes (Continued from the 20th)

— Gao Jiannong

When did sweet potatoes spread from abroad to China? Although there is no clear record in ancient books, we can infer a general idea from the evidence cited earlier. Ji Han lived in the late third century, and Jia Sixie, who wrote the "Essential Techniques for the Welfare of the People," lived slightly later. However, his book "fully covers the methods of farming, gardening, clothing, and food." Since he recorded sweet potatoes, he must have paid attention to their cultivation methods. We can imagine that sweet potatoes had already become widespread in northern China by his time. Therefore, it would not be too far from the truth to say that they were introduced to China slightly before the third or fourth centuries.

The more common name for sweet potatoes in northern China is "red potatoes." Their Latin name comes from Spanish, Patatas. As I mentioned in my article on potatoes, the homeland of sweet potatoes is also South America. They traveled with Spanish merchant ships to Europe and the Philippines. The reason they were able to benefit China so greatly was because they were willing to move their precious feet from the Philippines. There is solid evidence for this, and we do not need to speculate further. Let us now look at the records in our ancient Chinese books.

The clearest and most detailed description of this matter can be found in He Yuanqiao's "Min Shu" from the late Ming Dynasty. He said: "Sweet potatoes were obtained by the Chinese from foreign countries during the Wanli era... They are used to support the year and benefit the poor. I once wrote an Ode to Sweet Potatoes, which can give you an idea of their importance. The Ode says: 'Crossing Min and going south, there is Luzon... In that country, red sweet potatoes cover the fields and mountains, without the need for planting. The barbarians often take them as food... The skin of the root is thin and red, and it can be eaten after peeling, or cooked. It can be eaten cooked or raw... Although the barbarians let them grow wild without care, they are stingy and do not share them with the Chinese. The Chinese cut a foot or so of their vines, and soldiers brought them over. Thus, they entered our Fujian more than ten years ago. Although the vines are withered, they can be cut, planted, and will flourish after a few days, so they can be brought along.'" Xu Wending Gong also said in "Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration": "...The locals say that someone obtained this seed from overseas in recent years. People overseas also forbade it from leaving the country. This person took the vines and twisted them into a rope for drawing water, and thus was able to cross the sea and plant them, spreading them throughout Fujian and Guangdong." Furthermore, according to the Fujian Provincial Annals, Fuzhou Prefecture says: "Sweet potatoes have purple skin and taste sweeter than potatoes, and they are especially easy to propagate. This species was originally not found in the prefecture. During the famine in Wanli Jiawu (1594), the following year (1595), Grand Censor Jin Xueyan, who was in charge of Fujian, begged for seeds from foreign barbarians and taught the people to plant them as food, so the famine did not become a disaster."

### 800,000 Yuan in Relief Funds Have Been Allocated: Reportedly Half Distributed to Private Colleges and Universities, with the Remainder Divided Among Public and Some Private Schools. Inquiries to Relevant Parties Indicate No Official Order Received Yet.

(Great China News Agency) According to Chongqing news, the 800,000 yuan in relief funds allocated by the Executive Yuan for teachers and staff in Shanghai has reportedly been allocated by the Ministry of Education. It is claimed that "in addition to allocating funds to teachers and staff at 22 private colleges and universities, including Datong, the remaining 400,000 yuan has been allocated to middle schools run by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau, vocational supplementary schools run by the Ministry, former Shanghai Municipal Middle Schools, Jiangsu Province middle schools relocated to Shanghai, and 69 private middle schools in Shanghai, including Xiaoguang, Lide, Shanghai Vocational Supplementary School, Shanghai Provincial Middle School, and Huguang." It is also reported that "the Ministry has completed the allocation of these relief funds and has submitted separate reports to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that they be paid by emergency order directly to the various schools in Shanghai." However, when the Great China News Agency reporter inquired with relevant parties in this city about this news, they said that they have not yet received an official order regarding the allocation of relief funds. Therefore, it is not known which schools will receive relief funds at all. Although this news comes from the Ministry-compiled "Educational News Weekly," it cannot be definitively stated whether it has become a final decision before an official order is received. The current problem is to promptly request the Ministry of Education to decide on the allocation and to issue the funds as soon as possible. As for schools that have not yet been settled and are in need of relief, they should continue to apply for funds.

### Progress in Education in the Yikezhao League

(Yulin, 22nd) Education in the Yikezhao League has been developing rapidly in recent years. Elementary schools in each banner have received subsidies from the central government and have been established in succession. The Ministry of Education has recently allocated funds to establish a mass education center in the Kalongqi Banner.

### Guangxi Education Department: Improve Teaching in Various Schools

(Guilin Correspondence) The Guangxi Education Department, noting that various schools have often neglected aspects of teaching, has issued an order to strictly observe and improve the following key points: (1) Teaching in each subject often falls short of the scheduled progress. In the future, it is essential to implement teaching strictly according to the scheduled progress. According to regulations, at the beginning of each semester, a scheduled teaching progress chart must be filled out according to the curriculum standards for each subject, one copy for the school to check and one copy to be posted in the classroom for the students of each class. If a teacher needs to take leave or resign in the middle of the semester due to unavoidable circumstances, they must find a substitute teacher in advance before being approved, and the school must promptly appoint someone to fill the position and not delay. (2) It has been clearly stipulated in the language curriculum standards that middle school students should practice writing compositions once every two weeks, for two hours each time, with short exercises taking one hour. Each practice must include individual or group criticism and use various symbols for self-revision. It has been reported that some schools only conduct five or six composition exercises per semester, or even only three or four times, and the corrections are often perfunctory. This is unacceptable and must be strictly corrected according to regulations. If the writing time is delayed due to a teacher taking temporary leave or other incidents (such as air raid alerts or temporary meetings), the writing exercise must be made up. (3) High school English teachers should pay more attention to guiding students in writing common practical documents and short selections. If they have paid little attention or not implemented this at all, they should provide more opportunities for students to practice writing in the future. (4) Students' textbooks should be purchased in advance. Schools in Baise, Tianbao, Longzhou, Nanning, Wuming and other areas can borrow textbooks directly from the Nanning Library. If textbooks cannot be purchased or borrowed, the school should print and distribute outlines and have students take notes during lectures. (5) Attention should be paid to promoting student labor service, especially guiding students to take responsibility for cleanliness in various parts of the school. School servants should not be used at will.

### Zhejiang Youth Ge Zhaotong Invents an "Active Indexing Machine"; Seeks Collaborators for Trial Production

Zhejiang Fenghua youth Ge Zhaotong has been studying indexing techniques for many years. Recently, based on his painstaking research, he invented an "active indexing machine" for literature and data, which can serve as a general index box for Chinese literature. To use it, simply open the machine's door, set the first character of the information to be searched for, and then use the left hand to shake the indexing machine and the right hand to press the number key. The numbers of all desired materials from Chinese literature from ancient times to the present will be recorded on a piece of paper without omission. Then, comparing the numbers recorded on the paper with the original book (which has numbers printed next to each character in a grid), you can obtain the desired information. This invention is a major contribution to Chinese academic research and can be applied to research in philosophy, ethics, sinology, textual criticism, history, geography, and other sciences. Ancient people often spent their entire lives completing only one work, which was still difficult to call complete. If the indexing machine is used, materials that ancient people had difficulty collecting in a lifetime can be obtained in a very short period of time. For example, Tang Lu Yu spent his entire life completing the "Classic of Tea." If the indexing machine were used, it could be completed in a few days. Therefore, using this machine to compile tens of millions of specialized books is not a problem. The machine can quickly find any phrase in a short period of time, knowing which book, page, and line it is on, and even which character it is. The machine is lightweight and fast. Its indexing method is different from general Chinese and foreign indexing methods. The machine does not use cards to find information. Its indexing method is divided into single characters, double characters, and long sentences. Its functions are fourfold: (1) It can be used as the main index box for libraries; (2) It can be used by scholars and experts for academic research; (3) It can be used for reading and review; (4) It can be used for compiling various index books. It is reported that Ge has prepared diagrams and instructions and submitted them to the Ministry of Education for patent rights and is seeking collaborators to engage in trial production to provide to universities, research institutes, libraries, and academic experts for research and reference. The mailing address is P.O. Box 15, No. 202, No. 160 Edward Road.

### Central Construction-Education Cooperation Council Introduces Specialized Talents

(Chongqing News) The Central Construction-Education Cooperation Council is jointly composed of the Ministries of Education and Economy, as well as the Ministries of Interior, Military, Finance, and Transportation, and the Aviation Commission. Local branches are jointly established by the Departments of Construction, Education, and Civil Affairs, and major local educational institutions. Its mission is to promote communication between the construction and education sectors, to coordinate the supply and demand of talents during the war, and to connect production with education to increase efficiency. The Construction-Education Councils in Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces have already been established. Hunan and Shandong provinces are also preparing to establish them soon. The Construction-Education Cooperation network will soon be spread throughout the country, and cooperation between the central government and local governments, as well as cooperation among local governments, will also be promoted extensively.

The Council's affiliated Specialized and Technical Work Advisory Office is responsible for introducing various specialized and technical talents. Therefore, it has close ties with various national defense production and construction agencies and schools at all levels. Since its establishment, as of the end of last year, in addition to the service assignments of each year's graduates, which are centrally handled by the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, it has introduced a total of 1,046 specialized and technical personnel for employment. From January of this year to the present, it has continued to introduce another 121 people. These talents are mostly excellent mid-level technical cadres and have been well-received by all parties. However, construction agencies and vocational schools near the capital and in various provinces currently have a great need for talents in civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, mining and metallurgy, chemical engineering, papermaking, shipbuilding, and accounting statistics, and the compensation is very generous. In addition, middle schools in various counties in Sichuan Province need teachers in Chinese, English, history, geography, mathematics, physics, and zoology. The Northwest region also needs medical, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine talents. Letters have been sent to the office requesting their introduction. Talents in library science, music, scouting, and physical education are also in demand. It is reported that the office is currently searching extensively and has prepared P.O. Box No. 7, Qingmuguan, Chongqing, so that the above-mentioned talents can freely send letters of inquiry.

### Additional Entertainment for the Hong Kong Football Season: The Burmese Chinese Team Will Visit Hong Kong; Tan Jiangbai Included; Arriving in Early April

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Burmese Chinese football team will invade Hong Kong. It is learned that they are scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong in early April. The group consists of 17 people, and their military strength is very strong. The list of players has already been received from the team, along with a detailed introduction to each player's past experience. Among the 17 warriors, "Copper Head" Tan Jiangbai, whose name is known throughout China, is also included, which attracts special attention. It is a pity that Tan's old friends have all left Hong Kong for distant campaigns. Furthermore, the main forces of both the Eastern and Star Island teams have gone to the Philippines one after another, so they cannot interact with this visiting Chinese football team from the north, which is very regrettable. The resumes of the Burmese Chinese athletes are listed below, which can serve as a pleasant distraction for Shanghai fans.

Chen Zhenxing (Team leader, but not the "White Streak in the Waves" Chen Zhenxing who won the 100-meter freestyle championship at the 6th National Games in Shanghai and had a romance with the Mermaid) began his football career while studying at the school and is known as the "God of Football." His shooting skills are exceptionally accurate. Whenever he plays, he controls the ball and can move it left or right as he wishes. He has represented the Burmese team on many occasions and has performed in Ceylon, Calcutta, and Tripoli, earning praise.

Su Qingrui was the fastest center forward for the team when they played against Corinthian years ago. His heading skills are also excellent. He has represented the Burmese team extensively and represented the entire Burmese team against the Eastern and Star Island teams when they visited Burma last year. He will also play for the Burmese team this year.

Ji Jinyuan, nicknamed "Bull," is one of the best goalkeepers. He is exceptionally good at saving dangerous shots. He is currently a key member of the football team.

Wu Detang, currently the right-back, has represented the Burmese football team against the Corinthian football team. His tackling skills are very brave and constant. He is the best defender in the Burmese team and has made many contributions to the team.

Li Tongcheng currently plays left-back and also serves as center-back. His kicking is very strong. In Burma, he played against the visiting Eastern and Star Island football teams and is an outstanding inside-back.

Qiu Qichun can handle both left-center back and left-wing positions well. He has ample energy and is skilled at controlling the ball. He often wins and is a rare talent among the Burmese Chinese. He is currently the captain of the local government school football team.

Hong Hancheng plays center-back and is very fast. He is the best center-back in all of Burma. His shooting is powerful and he has been able to shoot from the center-back line from afar, hitting the target. His strength is evident.

Qiu Qirui, in the position of left-center back, runs and intercepts with bravery and skill. He has repeatedly saved the day in matches and has made significant contributions.

Lin Jinshui excels at left-inside back and can also fill in as center-back. He is an agile center-back talent.

Liang Bide, nicknamed "Ke Tudin," is a fast-moving player who currently plays right-wing. His shooting skills are also unique and praised by the audience.

Chen Shanfu is the youngest member of the team and currently plays right-inside forward. His running speed is unpredictable and he can avoid the solid and attack the weak, often achieving unexpected victories. He is considered a rare talent among forwards.

Hong Deyuan can play not only left-inside forward but also right-wing. His shooting skills are quite reliable. He once represented the Burmese team against the visiting Star Island team and played well.

Chen Dacheng currently plays left-wing. His passing art is exceptionally accurate. He has represented the Moulmein team in inter-city matches many times and has given impressive performances.

Tan Jiangbai is the most outstanding inside-back talent. He represented our country at the Berlin Olympics. He is excellent at heading and is known as "Copper Head." Hong Kong fans of all ages know him. His football skills have long been renowned throughout the country and need not be elaborated upon.

Qingchun is a short and steady center-back. Years ago, in an inter-city match, he faced Tan Jiangbai's team and committed a foul in the penalty area, but Tan Jiangbai's team failed to capitalize and was ultimately defeated.

Mei Shenglai can play both left and right wing. His dribbling is so fast that defenders often cannot stop him. He has represented the Burmese team against the visiting Eastern and Star Island teams.

Tian Yinshun currently plays center-back and can also play forward. His use of headers is very threatening. In 1938, he was selected to represent the Burmese team against the Corinthian team. He is very brave and has made many contributions to the Burmese team.

### Wartime Inventions: Vitamins and Food

— Yangtze River

War can indeed stimulate scientific leaps.

After the outbreak of this World War, the warring countries learned from the food panic that occurred during the last World War, which affected the military operations of the troops, so they exhausted their wisdom to study the invention of new foods.

Seven years ago, Vitamin B1 bread was still impossible. Five years ago, only millionaires could afford to buy a half-cent worth. Later, due to scientific progress, 50 pounds could buy a gram. Today, only three pounds can buy an ounce (28 grams). One ounce of nutrients can supply one person for a lifetime, or 30,000 people for one day. The Edinburgh professor who invented this new food now receives an annual subsidy of one million pounds from the British government to mix it into the daily food of civilians to improve people's health.

In addition, the mass production of Vitamin C has also achieved astonishing results. It is said that when Italy invaded Abyssinia, Mussolini recalled Sir Castellani, a military medical expert from London, to the front line to study scurvy in soldiers due to a lack of vegetables, lemons, and fruits. After the knight arrived, he forced everyone to eat a lemon a day, which solved this serious problem.

Recently, Mrs. Loewenfield, a British food expert, and the Wartime Food Department also advised the public to eat wild rose hips and make them into soup, jam, etc. because they contain a large amount of Vitamin C, so they also have the effect of preventing colds.

The Lancet, a well-known medical journal published in London, recently published an experiment by a famous physicist proving that two mice, one fed Vitamin B1 bread and one fed whole-wheat bread, resulted in the latter being twice as heavy. The Royal Society then published a paper denying the value of Vitamin B1 and believes that the British have regressed from the diet of "milk, fruits, green vegetables, and whole-wheat bread" to "white bread, meat." A fierce debate is now unfolding.

A food panic is bound to occur to varying degrees during wartime, and the nutritional problems of the people are indeed worthy of attention and research. It is hoped that our country's scientists and medical scientists will pay special attention to this advanced development of scientific and serious wartime problems.

### Please Use Domestic Goods to Make Spring Clothes

— Yu Chang

The spring breeze has blown away the cold season, and everyone is once again taking off their winter clothes, and what should follow is the clothing for early spring. Now let's talk about the spring clothing issue:

For women, suitable cheongsam materials for spring can be made from domestic cotton tweed. The material should be chosen to be stiff but soft, and the colors should be medium blue, beige, coffee, etc. The style only needs to be knee-length. This is not only economical and practical, but also looks very lively.

For men, suitable robe materials for spring should also be made from domestic goods, because "clothes are not important for their splendor, but for their appropriateness"; especially in this year, the word "frugality" should be the premise, and the products of our own country are simple and generous, and are truly the most ideal clothing materials!

### Residents and Electricity Use

— Mei Zi

Recently, calls for "saving electricity" have echoed everywhere. Indeed, we cannot ignore the seriousness of this issue. Therefore, our first step in remedying the situation is, of course, to make every effort to conserve electricity. This not only reduces electricity expenses for oneself but also benefits the public and society.

Regarding electricity use in stores, public entertainment venues, etc., the authorities have already issued advisories and restrictions. There's no need to discuss it further here. Now, I will write down some points of attention for households, which may be of some reference.

(1) Limit the Wattage of Light Bulbs: For example, if you originally used a 50-watt light bulb, you can now switch to a 25-watt or 15-watt bulb. It is best to buy several light bulbs. Use brighter bulbs when working and dimmer bulbs otherwise, always ensuring sufficient light for your needs. This will not hinder your work.

(2) Practice Going to Bed Early: Recently, daylight saving time has been promoted, so we can practice waking up and going to bed early. During the day, it is best not to rest and use daylight to do various chores (unless impossible). Once it gets dark, turn off the lights, rest, and chat. Going to bed around nine o'clock can also be said to be following the New Life Movement.

(3) Use 5-watt Light Bulbs in Stairwells and Other Places: These areas only need to be visible enough, not extremely bright.

(4) Avoid Turning on the Radio and Seek Other Legitimate Entertainment: Such as reading newspapers, singing, or playing musical instruments.

In short, there are many other ways to save electricity. It is up to each household to pay attention and research, striving to save as much as possible. I hope everyone will promote this.

### What a Subletter Said

— Sun Choucheng

After my article "A Message to Subletters on Isolated Island" and Yuan Mei Jun's twelve seven-character poems were published in this magazine on March 10, my old friend Jueshi came to me and said that according to this, it seemed that all subletters in Shanghai were like wolves and tigers, only seeking profit. As a subletter myself, I will now describe one or two of the despicable behaviors of a tenant, which are even worse than those of a subletter, for the readers' information. After the description, I will express my grievances, which have nowhere to be vented, in a seven-character poem, and I will consider myself a "vegetable head" (a local proverb meaning useless). This shows that not all subletters are black-hearted, but not all tenants are despicable. Now, I will transcribe his submission as follows. I hope that after reading this, both subletters and tenants can calm down, reflect on their own behavior, understand each other, and embrace the principle of "do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you." That would be fair. (The following are all Jueshi's words.) Four months before August 13, I rented a single three-story house in a lane in the French Concession for 26 yuan per month, with no courtyard in front and no back door, and I paid for water, electricity, and general taxes. In recent years, the landlord has increased the rent three times, and now the monthly rent is 41 yuan, an increase of more than 60%. The electricity bill has increased by 97%, the water bill by 30%, and the general taxes have also increased. I use two floors myself, and the third floor is rented to Mr. So-and-so for 14.5 yuan per month, including water and electricity. According to the 60% rent increase, it should now be 23 yuan, and the monthly water and electricity bill is 20 yuan. Now, there are five households in this house, so the cost should be divided into five shares, with the third floor taking two shares. Including taxes, the third floor should pay 14 yuan. (I only rent to one household on the third floor, but Mr. So-and-so sublets it to two households. Last year, people from the factory that Mr. So-and-so knew also ate in the old house. The number of people coming and going has increased tenfold compared to when it was originally rented, causing me endless trouble.) Calculating that the third floor should pay 37 yuan, Mr. So-and-so only agrees to 24.5 yuan, refuses to pay the rent, and gives no response. (He often uses 25-watt light bulbs and turns on the lights around 4:00 PM every day. When he goes out at night, the lights are not turned off even when no one is in the room. He uses water freely, leaving the tap running to wash things. I charge him 10 yuan for water and electricity, but the actual cost is probably more than that.) He has a "what can you do to me?" attitude. There are probably not a few such tenants in Shanghai, who only want to take advantage and do not care about the livelihood of the subletter. Therefore, I have written a seven-character poem and ask that it be published in the newspaper to encourage mutual understanding and awaken their conscience: "Subletters on the Huangpu River, their hearts are not all the same. If vegetable heads were all like me, subletters would be in dire straits."

### A Week's Worth of Home-Style Recipes

— Ms. Hua Ying

Goji berries have been on the market for a while. When they first came out, they were incredibly expensive, costing five yuan per catty. No matter how expensive they are, they're not worth that much money. My family buys two or three jiao worth every day, which is enough to stir-fry a plate. Goji berries are cooling and can clear heat. They have a slightly bitter taste. People who like them call it refined, while people who don't like them will probably shake their heads. I like goji berries, so I've eaten them several times since they came on the market. For meat dishes, you can stir-fry them with shredded pork, shrimp, or chicken slices. For vegetarian dishes, you can only stir-fry them plain, but bamboo shoot shreds are essential, and you should add more sugar to make them flavorful.

Monday: Stir-fried goji berries with shredded pork, braised tofu slices, stir-fried glass noodles with vegetables, bamboo shoot salad with lettuce

Tuesday: Curry beef slices, braised shrimp with tofu, pickled mustard greens with soybean sprouts, braised shredded radish

Wednesday: Stir-fried cauliflower with shredded pork, deep-fried yellow croaker slices, braised vegetarian ten-treasure dish, sesame sauce malantou

Thursday: Tomato beef soup, pan-fried hairtail with rice wine, dried tofu with daylily, scallion broad bean puree

Friday: Sweet and sour fried pork ribs, pork patty stewed with white gourd, lettuce leaf tofu, pickled mustard greens with mung bean sprouts

Saturday: Stewed bamboo shoots with salted meat and fresh meat, braised carp, tomato cabbage, stir-fried gluten with shrimp roe

Sunday: Duck giblet soup, steamed hairtail, stir-fried mustard greens, lettuce salad

### Yan Chen's Sad Feelings About Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Wang Yizhi, Sent from the Netherlands

In Commemoration of Mao Yi's Twenty-Second Anniversary of Death (Part 2)

At that time, I was flustered and disoriented, and I forgot the prescription for beef broth that I had taken with Mao on September 30. I could not even think of the English name of the beef broth company as Valentine's Meat Juice Company, let alone its local produce from Richmond, City of Wealth, Virginia, USA. Mao died of exhaustion, and both destiny and human affairs were in vain. My sin cannot be passed on. Later, on the 19th, I met Miss Peral L. Hill, a classmate of Mao Yi's at the summer school, and I never expected that the Lai Pi Pharmacy I wanted to visit was nearby, between 16th Street and Chestnut Street, not far from my hotel. The world sometimes collapses, and this hatred is endless. At this moment, my heart was broken and my soul was wounded, like a cliff flying down.

3. Water Note Remember, To Chant Autumn Light: Through Tribulation Worm Sand Brush Lost Wheel, The Most Difficult Moon Yao Ji Yan Chen, Window Still Is That Year's Shadow, Water Exhausts Southern Sky Does Not See People.

Western astrologers discuss human disasters and good fortune, saying that the progression of governance and chaos turns every eleven years and forty-three days. And such as earthquakes, cold weather, great wars, and great epidemics, comparing historical records and statistics, are especially clear and verifiable. This year, October 14, is exactly the twenty-second anniversary of Mao Yi's passing. On this day, there happens to be a moon and the sky is clear and fine, which is very similar to 1918. As a guest in a foreign land, this situation is not easy to obtain.

4. Lin Xia Write Line, To Chant Autumn Lai: Cold Ash Residual Candle Hundred Years Sadness, More Than Half The Journey Think Nian Street, Full Of Jiangguan Yaoluo Feeling, All Kinds Of Charm Clamp Autumn Come.

Mao Yi died as a guest in Nian 2nd Street in the old capital of the United States. Now, things have changed and stars have moved, and it has suddenly become a memory twenty-two years later. In a hundred years of life, more than half has passed, just like a traveler who is frightened by the cold, walking to the intersection of Twenty-Second Street, stroking his chest and mourning greatly, the world changes color for it.

Spring and Autumn

### After Reading the Datong News Agency's "Statement" — The Aftermath of Yu Qiaqing's "Announcement" —

— Qi Weide

On the 22nd, the Datong News Agency had a news item stating: "In Mr. Yu Qiaqing's recent public disclosure of his private rice trading accounts, there are three households: Zhao Qingji, Shenji, and Zhang Yuji. The outside world has some doubts. In fact, Zhao Qingji is Mr. Zhao Qinglan, chairman of the Rice Brokerage Association; Shenji is Shenji Rice Store on the upper floor of the Banque de l'Indochine on Beijing Road; Zhang Yuji is Mr. Zhang Yushu, manager of Tong Mao Xinji Rice Store. All of these are rice stores that resell from these households. At that time, due to space limitations in the advertisement, it was not possible to provide detailed information." What do I think? As far as I know: One month earlier, on the day before this news item, I had just written an article "Thoughts After Reading Yu's 'Announcement'" in this magazine, which included "Although the date only goes up to January 19 of this year, and the names of 'Shenji' and 'Zhao Jiji' appear under the sold items, it is inevitable that people will have doubts..." "A guilty conscience betrays itself." I felt that the Datong News Agency's "statement" was aimed at my article. I have no "relationship" with Yu and am even more "separated" from the rice industry. I am only expressing some personal views based on the facts. Moreover, my article already stated "In these difficult and trying years, it is not the time to seek merit or demerit. As long as what you do is, 'Looking back and reflecting on yourself,' truly for the welfare of society and the country, you can ignore praise or blame and strive to do your best." Therefore, it seems redundant for Yu to publish another announcement after having to leave Shanghai: Because those who "do not understand the truth" will not be satisfied with this advertisement. For example, I still have some doubts about the two points mentioned above. As for those who "already understand the truth," they naturally do not need any "petty words" like "the account books are there for inspection." For example, the Datong News Agency is willing to "bravely do what is right" by using "news" to compensate for the lack of advertising space.

However, it is precisely because of the Datong News Agency's "statement" that I have to add a little more to my "doubts." "Shenji" and "Zhao Qingji" are "debts with a responsible party"; but what about the accounts after January 19? On January 21, the merchant Hualun Yangxing's ship the "Glan" transported 27,990 bags; on February 5, the manager of the same company's ship the "G.G.A. Vaenne" transported 31,000 bags; on February 15, the same company's ship the "A.bert Sarrant" transported 24,500 bags; on March 16, the ship "Deda" transported 30,913 bags; on March 18, the "G.G.A. Varenne" again transported 30,500 bags; the above totals 144,903 bags. I wonder if the Datong News Agency can find the "household names" for these hundreds of thousands of bags of rice for me?

In short, Yu's "announcement" clearly states that "Due to his long-term involvement in the shipping industry, the difficulty of transporting ships can be barely eliminated," and "He has been doing business in Shanghai for sixty years." In business, because he has his own "iron barges" and can take some "advantage" in "shipping costs," it is not too much. However, precisely because "Qiaqing is old," he "suffers this blame for seeking perfection." Others who are "getting old" should read this "announcement" and be wary. As for those who are far from "old," they simply hope that rice prices will fall. How can rice prices fall? In addition to the efforts of the authorities and people from all walks of life, newspapers and news agencies should also bear the responsibility of public opinion.

### Big Fish Eats Small Fish

— Yang

"Sold it yet?"

The door of the small room opened with a "creak," and Mrs. Wang hurriedly asked Mr. Wang, who ran in, covered in sweat.

Mr. Wang did not answer, just shook his head and sighed.

Mr. Wang looked at Mrs. Wang, and Mrs. Wang looked at Mr. Wang. Finally, Mr. Wang broke the silence.

"These奸商 (treacherous merchants), they deserve to be killed! According to the market, each box should be 40 yuan, but I'm selling them cheap!

That's all I have to say, judge me as you will. I gave them 35, they didn't want it, heck, they wanted to cut it down to 30 yuan a box. I ran around in a big circle, it was all like this. I, I bought them for 22 yuan a box, and there's also the transportation fee, sigh!"

Mr. Wang looked at the ten boxes of soap piled under the bed, and his heart was filled with endless sorrow. Mr. Wang is a teacher at ×× Middle School. With his ability, he actually teaches at three middle schools in this isolated island where it is difficult to find work. But, no matter what, he always has to withdraw some from Mrs. Wang's savings every month to supplement expenses.

Last week, Mr. Wang saw that the market was rising again, and he had a clever idea. He persuaded Mrs. Wang to withdraw all the funds to earn "big money." Mrs. Wang was reluctant at first, but in the end, she was persuaded by Mr. Wang and withdrew 350 yuan. Mr. Wang then happily went to buy ten boxes of soap, thinking that he could make a high profit from this and no longer have to be a teacher.

Sure enough, the soap rose in price. Every morning, Mr. Wang would always open the newspaper to read the economic news, and he was always happy, talking at length about his great plan.

Mrs. Wang was also very happy, because according to Mr. Wang, 350 had turned into at least 400!

But, it is said that the market is about to fall. And, there is another big reason, Mr. Wang's rice jar is already empty. Therefore, Mr. Wang decided to sell five boxes first.

Yesterday, Mr. Wang ran around all day; today, Mr. Wang ran around again.

"Didn't you say a box should be over 40, how come no one wants it for 35?"

"This, this is the treachery of the merchants!"

"I, I said it was better to be content, ill-gotten gains don't enrich the poor!"

"Hmph! Now you're saying sarcastic things, didn't you want to get rich?" Mr. Wang got angry.

"I'm not selling! I'm not selling! I won't sell until it's 40 yuan a box!"

This made Mr. Wang even angrier, "Tomorrow, what about tomorrow's rice?"

After he finished speaking, he suddenly stood up and walked out.

"What do you plan to do?"

"What plan is there? Go sell it!" Mr. Wang seemed to have become a prisoner on the battlefield, defeated and discouraged.

"Don't leave five boxes to wait for the price to rise?"

"Rise? Bah!"

Mr. Wang went out and quickly returned.

"Loss of 20 yuan! No! Make the treacherous merchants earn dozens of yuan, sigh!"

Mr. Wang said dejectedly, his hopes completely dashed!

From this great rise, Mr. Wang no longer thought about getting rich.

### Obvious Joke

— Qian Changnian

An upcoming masterpiece by a certain great writer, soon to be published, has a section describing the extravagance of a wealthy family's daughter, saying: "She went to the ×× company and ordered a dozen pairs of identical high-heeled shoes, regardless of color, at a price of 49 yuan and 9 jiao per pair..." Below the price, the great writer added in large parentheses: "(This is based on the Shanghai market price in April of the 30th year of the Republic of China.)" It is said that Shanghai's prices are soaring, without stopping. Perhaps in a year or two, or even a few months, the prices will be very different, losing the original meaning of the text.

Writers across the country followed suit, and on average, in every 100,000 words of text, this type of annotation took up 13,741 words. Publishers shook their heads, as these annotations were still counted as the main text - 1 yuan in legal tender per 1,000 words, the same price as 1 yuan per catty of green vegetables at that time.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouhe

(5) The Boundary Between Love and Desire

Xiang Qi not only told him everything about how she had been deceived by Yuan Baofan, but also said very clearly that she was willing to be his friend forever.

In the life history of Qiu Haitang (Begonia), this day was truly the happiest day! At lunchtime, his appetite had increased threefold compared to usual; but if someone asked him which dish was the best, or what Zhao Si said to him while he was eating, he would definitely not be able to answer.

"If only we had met a year earlier!" He was washing his face in the room, and he couldn't help but think of Luo Xiangqi again, and sighed to himself.

He saw that it was still early, and although he didn't know where Liangmi Street, which Xiangqi had mentioned, was, he thought that it wouldn't be too difficult to find it in two hours. So he decided to go out alone first, without mentioning a word to Zhao Si, Rongkui and the others, so as not to leave any trace in the future.

The Chinese part of Tianjin was not very big to begin with. Although he didn't take a rickshaw, relying only on his two legs to walk, after walking for more than three quarters of an hour, he finally found this remote little road behind Hubu Street. Number 34 was an old, low-rise house, with at most two courtyards, but the courtyard between the main gate and the second gate was quite wide; on the east and west sides, there were large locust trees, with their branches twisted and turning, forming a canopy like two broken umbrellas with the paper removed. The ground was very clean, and the doors, windows, and walls were painted very newly. The last time they were renovated was probably no more than three months ago!

Qiu Haitang hesitated for a long time at the entrance to the second gate, not daring to go in. First, he was afraid that it was too early, and Xiangqi herself had not yet arrived; second, he thought that a guest who had arrived here should at least call out, but how should he call out? Although he had learned Xiangqi's name from the reply letter, how could he directly and bluntly call out "Is Xiangqi at home?" when they were only new friends who had met twice?

Helplessly, he had to cough loudly twice, just like he did on stage. (62)
