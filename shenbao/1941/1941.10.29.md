### Maintaining the Policy of Freedom of the Seas: U.S. Navy Fully Prepared. President Roosevelt's Speech Strongly Condemns Nazism: If Germany Takes a Desperate Gamble, It Will Mark the Beginning of Its Downfall.

United Press International, Washington, 28th: President Roosevelt yesterday called on the American people to unite and become a single-minded arsenal, because "we have frankly and simply vowed to eradicate Hitlerism." He also declared, "We must arm merchant ships to deal with the rattlesnakes of the sea, we must have the freedom to transport American goods to friendly ports, and we must be protected by the American Navy." The President stated that America's greatest task is to manufacture more armaments to supply the soldiers of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union who are resisting aggression. Sending goods to friendly nations is the will of the entire nation, and the hunting and harming of our country's ships and sailors is an open frustration of our national will. I now declare that we will never abandon our original intention because of this. Our determination has been demonstrated in the order to the U.S. Navy to "attack enemy ships upon sight." These orders are still in effect." The President made these remarks on Navy Day, saying, "America has tried to avoid shooting, but shooting has already occurred. History has recorded who fired the first shot." He also said that Hitler hopes to scare us away from the high seas and force us into a trembling retreat. Hitler is making a misjudgment of the American spirit. This is not the first time. This American spirit has now been roused.

Discovery of a Secret Map Exposes Nazi Ambitions

The President also said that he has a secret map drawn by Germany, which reveals Hitler's conspiracy against the Americas. Berlin geographers arbitrarily altered existing boundaries, dividing South America into five vassal states, placing the entire South America under their rule. They also included these puppet states, including the Republic of Panama, and included the Panama Canal, the lifeline of our country. Speaking of the eleven brave sailors who died on the American destroyer "Kearny," Roosevelt said that many American merchant ships have been sunk on the high seas. An American destroyer was attacked on September 4, and another was hit on September 17. Roosevelt said, "Hitler's move is nothing more than to intimidate us, forcing us to retreat. If our national policy is controlled by the psychology of fear of shooting, then our ships and the ships of our sister republics will be bound and confined to ports. We oppose this matter, which concerns our own interests, our self-esteem, our credibility, and the freedom of the seas. Freedom of the seas has always been the basic policy of this government."

Replacing Religion with Iron and Blood: Civilization Will Decline

The President also said that the United States has obtained the details of a Nazi plan to "eliminate all existing religions. All religions, such as Christianity, Catholicism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism, are included. All church property will be confiscated by Germany. The cross and other religious symbols will be forced into silence, otherwise they will taste the experience of concentration camps. At present, there are countless people who are bearing the pain of shackles because they put God above Hitler. Germany will establish an international Nazi church, with personnel appointed by the Nazi government to manage it. Replacing the Bible will be "Mein Kampf," which will henceforth be listed as the sacred golden rule. Replacing the cross will be the Nazi swastika and a drawn sword. The "god of iron and blood" will replace the position of the "loving God."

Only by Destroying Nazism Can Peace Be Established

President Roosevelt also said that the Nazi map of South America "clearly shows that the Nazis not only have a conspiracy against South America, but also intend to extend their reach to the United States." He believes that the Axis newspapers and radio stations will try their best to deny this, and they greatly praise a portion of Americans who believe that "Germany is harmless to others." Germany is now using the words of these Americans as proof that the United States is a divided mess. He also said, "The Nazis have themselves listed many Americans in the book of heroes. It is a pity that there are very few names listed in that book, and I am proud that my name is not in it." The President also said, "The advance of the Nazis can be stopped, and will be stopped. At present, we vow in the simplest and clearest language to destroy Hitlerism. After we help destroy Hitlerism, we will help establish a new peace, so that the good people of the world can obtain better prosperity, security, freedom, and integrity."

Implementing Naval Escorts: Assisting Anti-Aggression Nations

We are increasing the production of armaments every day to support those fighting on the front lines. This is our first task. American goods arriving in friendly countries is the will of the nation. We have been greatly troubled, but we will never abandon our original intention. He also said, "The actions taken by the Senate and the House of Representatives to amend the Neutrality Act are an honest and practical path." "Merchant ships of various countries should be armed as self-defense against the rattlesnakes of the sea. Merchant ships should be free to transport American goods to the ports of our friends. Merchant ships should be protected by the U.S. Navy. The goods will undoubtedly be delivered by us." The Navy Department believes that the traditional call of "Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead" is needed. President Roosevelt also said that the production of American war materials "cannot be hindered by the selfishness of a few dangerous industrialists, who are seeking extra profits and 'business as usual,' nor can life be hindered by the selfishness of a few dangerous labor leaders, who are a threat to labor itself and to the nation."

Judging from Past Historical Facts, Allied Forces Will Ultimately Win

The President stated that the Navy is ready for action, and the Atlantic patrol has already been dispatched. He said that the War Department is also gradually strengthening its strength to resist the aggressors. President Roosevelt predicted that when Hitler is forced into a tiger-riding situation, it will be the beginning of his downfall, "because dictators of Hitler's type can only survive with constant victories and conquests." After briefly stating that the Allied forces ultimately achieved victory after the Russian army's defeat in 1918, he also said, "The Soviet Union needs assistance right now, and we and Britain will continue to assist them." The President continued to pay tribute to the Soviet resistance to the Nazis, saying, "American production has a major task: on the one hand, to equip its own army, and on the other hand, to assist China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. In order to carry out this task, we dare not fail, nor will we fail."

Preparing to Accept the Challenge: Maintaining National Glory

He said that if the world is ruled by the firing squads of the German secret police, Americans will not be able to survive here. Some people now believe that our great happiness has betrayed us, saying that we cannot compete with a well-trained and brutal army. Those who say this do not know America and American life. This is a great land because it is constantly challenged. Our history is a history of fierce challenges. We will continue to accept and conquer them. We have emerged from them as the most powerful nation in modern history. Today, we are facing the newest and greatest challenge. We Americans are ready for everything, stepping into our positions. We are ready to defend the country and the integrity of our ancestors, so that we can use the strength given to us by God to fulfill our heavenly duty.

### U.S. Solemnly Commemorates Navy Day: Knox Calls for National Unity. U.S. Determined to Defend Outposts with Strength: Stark and Nimitz Warn in Speeches

Havas News Agency, New York, 27th: Today is "Navy and National Defense Day." Celebrations are being held enthusiastically in all states. The United States is commemorating "Navy Day" for the 22nd time. This year, because the United States is approaching the brink of war, and is building warships on a large scale to protect the freedom of the seas, the commemoration is expected to be particularly grand.

Reuters, Detroit, 28th: U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox delivered a Navy Day speech here yesterday, calling for national unity so that the United States can avoid the fate of France. Selfish partisan views and internal divisions must be eliminated. He said, "If we need to make a decision, this is the determination of the path we should take. We can learn from the tragic situation in France to warn ourselves. The Germanic masters of France are now, in order to prevent assassination, carrying out large-scale retaliation for the massacre of innocents, while the old Marshal Pétain begs his countrymen to be extra submissive to their masters to avoid more cruel retaliation. What a pitiful sight! Let us think about it." Knox condemned isolationism, saying that the Soviet Union was the first to adopt this policy, but the result was only to bring disaster. Knox also expressed the Navy's gratitude for labor cooperation, but said that we still need better cooperation.

United Press International, Chicago, 28th: Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark said here yesterday on "Navy Day" that the United States "has encountered a threat unprecedented in several generations." Admiral Stark said that the steps chosen by the United States are to uphold the justice and dignity of American rights, and to prepare to resist such rights with force. "This is the only hope for uniting other non-plundering countries." He also said, "The Navy Department is using the technology learned from abroad to do its best to complete preparations to cope with future days, but it cannot say what the future holds."

United Press International, Indianapolis, 28th: Chief of the Bureau of Navigation Rear Admiral Nimitz warned in a Navy Day speech last night that unless the United States can maintain the outposts of democratic politics and culture, namely China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, otherwise, our country will surely become a small island in a chaotic and turbid world. Rear Admiral Nimitz said, "I believe that we will not be swallowed up, which is extremely fortunate. In order to defend ourselves against any possible aggressors or joint aggressors, and in order to assist those who are fighting fiercely against totalitarian aggression, we should be strong enough to guarantee the seven seas, so as to shoulder the heavy responsibility entrusted by our country's factories and farms. This guarantee is the activity of the American Navy." This is also our country's first line of defense and the principles of our country's survival that are facing crisis today. Our country's guarantees to Britain and China, and the fulfillment of the promise to transport materials to the Soviet Union, require one's own sacrifice and increased production.

### Hull and Stettinius Argue: Arming Merchant Ships is Necessary. The U.S. Will Not Rush Into War Unless Forced. Senate Begins Debate on Amending Neutrality Act

Reuters, Washington, 28th: When the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reviewed the Neutrality Act amendment yesterday, Secretary of State Hull attended the meeting to present his views, stating that the United States has no intention of rashly going to war. He said, "What the United States is following now is a path not prohibited by the Neutrality Act. We must protect our rights in the Atlantic to resist the actions of lawless forces. We should take a firm path, neither stubborn nor unnecessarily seeking trouble, but enough to command the respect of warriors. Even if it does not have to be put into practice, we cannot but think so at present. The United States is now faced with the task of protecting its shipping industry to resist submarines. Someone will be injured as a result. This can indeed be said to be a step leading to war or other events, but if Hitler does not force us to fight, then we do not intend to be involved in any war. It is definitely not in Hitler's interest to force us to fight. The Germans are a brave nation. If they think that we are making too many concessions and shrinking back, then they will accelerate along the path they are currently taking. The best authorities all know that if Hitler achieves his ultimate goal of defeating Britain and the British fleet in order to rule the seas, then we will encounter terrible danger. Now, none of Hitler's words and deeds do not indicate that he harbors the ambition to rule the world. If what I said is not true, then Congress can throw me out of the window." Hull advocated that the arming of merchant ships should be expanded, and that American merchant ships should be allowed to travel anywhere. After Hull's speech, the Foreign Relations Committee voted 13 to 10 in favor of Hull's proposal. The remarks made by Chief of Naval Operations Stark to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week were released yesterday. Stark briefly stated that arming merchant ships can reduce the possibility of being attacked. He believes that among the victims of merchant ships attacked during the war, 50% were unarmed merchant ships. If merchant ships are armed, they have shot down many planes. Stark also answered Vandenberg's question, saying that naval-trained crew members on merchant ships can, in accordance with the President's orders to the Navy, open fire on Axis ships upon sight. For the sake of resisting the enemy, he believes that merchant ship crew members must open fire. He feels that Hitler will attack the United States when he can attack the United States, regardless of what we do. When the time comes, Hitler will make this cold-blooded decision, regardless of whether it is worth it or not. Since Hitler attacked Poland, Belgium, Norway, and other countries without any reason, why would he need an excuse to attack the United States in the future.

United Press International, Washington, 28th: Yesterday, the Senate began debating the amendment to the Neutrality Act. At the same time, the leaders told President Roosevelt that the amendment is expected to be decided in a week.

Dodd Demonstrates that Germany is Quite Concerned About the U.S. Entering the War

Reuters, Washington, 28th: Former U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Dodd spoke to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, saying that he met with Hitler four months ago, and first asked him about the American shipping problem. He often heard people say that Hitler was an extremely delusional madman, and some people said that Hitler would fall to the ground and bite the carpet in anger at certain times, but when he met him, he felt that Hitler's attitude was calm and his mind was clear. Hitler replied that escorting was no different from war. The German government is concerned about the United States entering the war, not because of the United States' current capabilities, but because of the United States' great potential. American equipment won the last victory, and the Germans know this. Hitler also said that if the United States enters the war, it will have a great impact on the morale of the German people. The German people are not fond of war. They are not interested, but they are afraid of a retaliatory peace that is even more severe than the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, they would rather continue to fight. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop once told him that American participation in the war would turn into a war between two hemispheres, which would drag on and eventually destroy the entire world. Dodd's remarks and Hull's and Stettinius's opinions have all been copied by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday morning and sent to the Senate for reference when debating the amendment to the Neutrality Act.

The U.S. Current Naval Strength is Sufficient to Cope with a Two-Ocean War

Havas News Agency, New York, 27th: According to the speech delivered by the commander of the Massachusetts naval base in Boston, the U.S. Navy had a total of 121,000 personnel in 1939, which increased to 170,000 last year. By last month, it had increased to 292,000. It is estimated that when the two-ocean fleet is completed in 1947, the U.S. Navy personnel will reach 968,000. In terms of the number of ships, in April of this year, the naval fleet already had 15 battleships, with 7 under construction, 6 aircraft carriers, with 12 under construction, 27 cruisers, with 54 under construction, 164 destroyers, with 200 under construction, and 107 submarines, with 78 under construction. Since April of this year, many more ships have been completed. As for the naval air force, a year ago there were only 3,000 air force personnel and 2,250 aircraft. There are now 4,500 personnel and 4,500 aircraft. According to the planned plan, a total of 15,000 aircraft will be built.

### China Elated, Tokyo Silent

Reuters, Chongqing, 28th: Chinese sources are pleased with President Roosevelt's Navy Day speech, in which he stated that U.S. production has the task of assisting China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. They believe that this is a firm reply to Tokyo's repeated appeals against the United States continuing to aid China. However, these sources strongly emphasize that providing China with appropriate supplies is now more urgent than ever, because the Japanese government is now led by a more militarized cabinet. All sectors in China are paying close attention to the U.S. President's speech, but officials have no comment until they receive a more detailed summary of the speech. Judging from the content of the speech received here, it seems that the U.S. President did not specifically mention the Far East or Japan. This may imply that the United States is still continuing its policy of concentrating its attention on the battle of democratic countries against Hitler, and avoiding conflict in the Far East.

United Press International, Tokyo, 18th: The Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau today declined to comment on President Roosevelt's speech, admitting that it was about President Roosevelt's failure to mention Japanese-American relations.

### Berlin Denies

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 28th: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman claimed that President Roosevelt's claim that Germany has a plan to divide Central and South America is intended to create a psychology of fear of Germany in Central and South American countries, so as to bring them into the embrace of the United States. Roosevelt also said that the U.S. government obtained German documents revealing Germany's plan to abolish all religions, which is also a deceptive statement and not a fact.

Ottawa: The Canadian government has expressed its agreement to the Chinese government's proposal to appoint Liu Shishun as the first Chinese ambassador to Canada. (Reuters, 28th)

Chongqing: Australian Ambassador Eggleston presented his credentials to Chairman Lin today. The text of his congratulatory speech and the Chairman's reply are as follows:

Australian Ambassador's Congratulatory Speech

Chairman: I am appointed as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Australia, and I am honored to present my credentials to Your Excellency. I am instructed to express the goodwill of my government and people to Your Excellency, and to wish your country prosperity and your people happiness. The decision of my government to send a Chinese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China is based on the belief that this will usher in a new era in the close and friendly relations between the peoples of China and Australia. We also believe that the friendship between our two countries is necessary for the sake of achieving genuine peace and prosperity in the Pacific. The mutual exchange of envoys between China and Australia will be beneficial in both moral and material terms. This is what my government firmly believes, and the two countries' cultures will thus be able to understand each other better and benefit each other. Both of our countries are currently engaged in a great struggle for survival. Australia deeply admires China for its heroic spirit in enduring war in order to uphold its principles, its determination to defend freedom and safeguard territorial integrity, and the courage and perseverance shown by its leaders and people in striving for this great goal. In the current struggle, China and Australia share the same sentiments in loving freedom and hating aggression. Australia is fighting for its national survival, and will spare no sacrifice to protect the heritage of its ancestors. This is no less than China. In terms of Australia's population and resources, its combat power is great in terms of manpower and military. The opinion of the government and the public is united, especially in supporting the development of its combat power to the highest degree. Therefore, based on the position and environment of our two countries, the increase and development of the friendship between the two countries seem to have a solid foundation. I am honored to be appointed by the monarch of my country to shoulder this important task, and I am very happy to be able to cooperate in establishing friendly and beneficial relations between the two countries in the future. I dare to ask Your Excellency and the Chinese people to cooperate in completing this important mission.

Chairman's Reply

Your Excellency Ambassador: I am very pleased to receive your credentials as the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Government of Australia to China. I am also grateful for your Excellency's transmission of the kind intentions of your government and people. I would like to express the same sentiments to your government and people. The significance of Australia establishing an embassy in China is as important as you said. The important step taken by the two governments to exchange envoys will surely make the friendly relations between the two countries in politics, economy, or culture stronger and more consolidated. This is what the Chairman and your government believe is exactly the same. At present, the ideals of democracy and a just life are suffering an unprecedented crisis, and world culture is also threatened by the evil forces to be completely destroyed. It is necessary for all freedom-loving democratic countries to work together at this time to resist the attacks of tyranny and aggression. I am deeply gratified that the united front of the ABCD Group has been established in this turbulent world. The responsibility of this group is to subvert violence and rebuild a world order based on law, justice, and economic stability. Our two countries, through thick and thin, are sworn to fight for a common principle. With your country's vast land, people's efforts, abundant resources, and its strategic position in the Pacific, your country will always be an important member in the struggle for human freedom. Your country's troops have repeatedly demonstrated their heroic resistance and indomitable spirit on the European and African battlefields. The great progress of your country's national defense industry shows your country's determination, courage, and adaptability, which has been deeply admired by the Chinese people. China has suffered war for longer than Australia, but China's efforts have not slackened, and it has always resolutely continued to fight together, and it will not be corrected without winning the final victory. For the sake of achieving this goal, the mutual assistance between our two countries will undoubtedly have endless benefits, and will lay a solid foundation for the ever-increasing friendship between the two countries. The Chinese government and people will, of course, be happy to provide full assistance to Your Excellency in completing your important mission. (28th)

華府注意　日蘇邊釁
Washington Pays Attention: Japanese-Soviet Border Conflicts

　　此間官方對日蘇邊境衝突之消息、表示極大不安、因此舉可示日本擬於最近之將來進攻西伯利亞也、官方指出日本侵入蘇聯領土之動機、或係欲探測蘇軍有無抵抗準備、日之俘蘇軍者、則欲推測沿海諸省之蘇聯軍力、並欲知蘇軍是否業已撤往西綫、以及觀察美政府之反響等、若日本攻蘇、美將採若何行動一事、官方並無暗示、惟衆信若日本決意作戰、則首先必將有若干邊境衝突、繼以向莫斯科提出要求、然後施行大規模攻勢云、
Officials here have expressed great concern over the news of the Japanese-Soviet border conflicts, as this may indicate that Japan intends to attack Siberia in the near future. Officials pointed out that Japan's motives for invading Soviet territory may be to probe the Soviet army's readiness to resist, to estimate the Soviet military strength in the coastal provinces by capturing Soviet soldiers, to find out whether the Soviet army has already withdrawn to the Western Front, and to observe the reaction of the American government. Officials made no hint as to what actions the United States would take if Japan attacked the Soviet Union. However, it is generally believed that if Japan is determined to go to war, there will first be some border conflicts, followed by demands to Moscow, and then a large-scale offensive.

社評堅守增援與反攻
Editorial: Hold Fast, Reinforce, and Counterattack

　　　　冬季已經降臨蘇聯的廣大原野，德軍並沒有能夠如其預期，及早達到佔領莫斯科的目的。這是希特勒當前的一個重大失敗。據近兩日前方電訉，莫斯科附近正降着雨雪，德軍坦克車和重武器，已因地面泥濘而無法前進。德國的步兵，須與天空的蘇聯機羣，和周圍反攻的蘇軍相挣扎，而脚下深達踝際的泥坑，又阻遏着行進。假定在最近一兩週內，德軍還攻不下莫斯科，則一等風雪漫大，堅冰載途的時候，無論如何，大規模的戰爭，就不得不暫吿停頓。德軍那時最嚴重的問題，恐怕不會再是如何攻佔莫斯科，而僅是如何滯留在莫斯科外圍的數百萬大軍，能夠勉强在荒寒的郊原上、渡過他們的冬季。
Winter has arrived on the vast plains of the Soviet Union, and the German army has not been able to achieve its goal of occupying Moscow as early as it had expected. This is a major failure for Hitler at present. According to dispatches from the front a couple of days ago, it is raining and snowing near Moscow, and German tanks and heavy weapons are unable to advance due to the muddy ground. German infantry must struggle against Soviet aircraft in the sky and the counterattacking Soviet forces around them, while deep, ankle-deep mud pits underfoot hinder their advance. Assuming that the German army still cannot capture Moscow in the next week or two, then once the wind and snow are overwhelming and the roads are covered with ice, large-scale warfare will have to be temporarily suspended no matter what. The most serious problem for the German army at that time will probably no longer be how to capture Moscow, but only how the millions of troops stranded on the outskirts of Moscow can barely survive the winter in the desolate wilderness.

　　所以，莫斯科的形勢能吾穩定，大概在這一二週內，便可見到分曉。這裏有最主要的三點，可以作爲判斷的依據：第一，是德軍能吾殲滅蘇軍的主力。在德軍這次對莫斯科的巨大鉗形運動裏，牠一再以許許多多的局部鉗形運動，企圖分頭殲滅蘇軍，而每一次，每一役，都被蘇軍突圍而去，這樣，德軍就無法給蘇軍以致命　打擊，而取得決定性的勝利。今後短期間內，德軍除了對蘇車主力加以澈底擊潰殲滅外，仍然沒有其他途徑，可以佔領莫斯科。第一，是德軍能吾完成對莫斯科的包圍。因爲蘇軍突圍後退時一再把戰綫向兩翼擴展的結果，德軍也就不得不被迫把包圍形勢的鉗爪，一再向左右延伸。可是一直到今天，不獨德軍的鉗形運動始終沒有合攏，而且最近幾天，德軍左右兩翼，似乎已經沒有追隨蘇車，再作無限制的伸展了。如果這就是德軍放棄包圍莫斯科的徵兆，那末，這不啻是說明牠已經暫時放棄佔領莫斯科的野心；吾則牠一定是待生力軍，再作大規模的包圍運動，果然如是，也必須於一兩個禮拜內期其實現。第三，是蘇聯生力軍源源開抵莫斯科的問題。首先因爲德軍沒有很快地擊潰蘇軍主力、一舉而抵莫斯科的城下，於是自月初以來一個月的惡鬥，己經給蘇軍以充足的時間，增加生力軍，而完成莫斯科的堅强防禦。照現在形勢看，德。蘇兩方在莫斯科附近的固有戰鬥力，都呈現了强弩之末；今後的勝負，要決之於兩方面生力軍的强弱。
Therefore, whether the situation in Moscow can be stabilized will probably be seen within the next week or two. Here are three main points that can be used as a basis for judgment: First, can the German army annihilate the main force of the Soviet army? In the German army's huge pincer movement against Moscow this time, it repeatedly attempted to annihilate the Soviet army separately with many local pincer movements, but each time, in each battle, the Soviet army broke through, so that the German army was unable to inflict a fatal blow on the Soviet army and achieve a decisive victory. In the short term, the German army still has no other way to occupy Moscow except to thoroughly defeat and annihilate the main force of the Soviet army. First, can the German army complete the encirclement of Moscow? Because the Soviet army repeatedly expanded the battle line to both wings when breaking through and retreating, the German army had to be forced to extend the pincers of the encirclement to the left and right again and again. However, until today, not only has the German army's pincer movement never closed, but in recent days, the German army's left and right wings seem to have stopped following the Soviet army and making unlimited extensions. If this is a sign that the German army is giving up on encircling Moscow, then this is tantamount to saying that it has temporarily abandoned its ambition to occupy Moscow; otherwise, it must wait for fresh troops to make another large-scale encirclement movement, and if so, it must be realized within a week or two. Third, is the issue of the continuous arrival of Soviet reinforcements in Moscow. First of all, because the German army did not quickly defeat the main force of the Soviet army and reach the city of Moscow in one fell swoop, the fierce fighting for a month since the beginning of the month has given the Soviet army ample time to increase reinforcements and complete the strong defense of Moscow. Judging from the current situation, the inherent combat power of both Germany and the Soviet Union near Moscow has shown signs of exhaustion; the victory or defeat in the future will depend on the strength of the reinforcements on both sides.

　　所以無論如何，蘇軍必須以任何代價，再準備一兩個禮拜的奮戰，堅强地守住莫斯科。現在比較値得担心的，還是南路　軍向高加索一帶　衝進。這不僅是蘇聯方面一個非常嚴重的防禦問題，連英國在近東一帶的駐軍，這時也不得小趕快戒慎起來，準備接受重大的試騐。也就如同在東ABCDR集團，形成一道堅强陣綫，固守海參崴。西伯利亞·外蒙·陝·甘·襄·樊·長沙·兩廣·香港·泰國·以及新加坡等地，不准侵略者再前進前步一樣，西力戰塲上，英·蘇等國也必須堅守列寗格勒，莫斯科，高加索，土耳其，近東，及非洲等地，使侵略者無法再向前推進。
Therefore, in any case, the Soviet army must prepare for another week or two of hard fighting at any cost to firmly defend Moscow. What is more worrying now is the advance of the southern army into the Caucasus region. This is not only a very serious defense problem for the Soviet Union, but even the British troops stationed in the Near East must quickly be vigilant and prepare to accept a major test. Just like in the east, the ABCDR group forms a strong line of defense, firmly defending Vladivostok, Siberia, Outer Mongolia, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xiangyang, Fancheng, Changsha, Guangdong and Guangxi, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Singapore, etc., not allowing the invaders to advance another step. On the Western battlefield, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries must also firmly defend Leningrad, Moscow, the Caucasus, Turkey, the Near East, and Africa, etc., so that the invaders cannot advance any further.

　　這樣東西兩面堅守，侵略勢力絕對沒有什麼前途的情勢下，現在最緊急的問題，就是增援。所有中·美·英·蘇等國各方面近來的表示，都在十分地强調這一點。現在各國不獨要在武器與資源上作最大的努力，互相接濟，互相補充，即使在戰略上，也要作進一步的整個配合與發動。譬如對於蘇聯莫斯科的保衛及唐納資河流域的抵抗，目前各方面所竭力呼籲着的，就是英國趕緊開始對大陸反攻。分散美國的兵力。然而，現在值得注意的觸目現象，却是英·美·蘇三國官方對於英國發動反攻的並無正式表示。當然，主絕不是一個偶然現象，我們必須指出來，本月初舉行的莫斯科三强會議裏，對於這一整個戰略配合的問題，無論如何，是應當早已討論到的。那末，現在三國官方的沉默，推測起來，當然是首先表示牠們對蘇聯抗戰力量的絕對有把握。其次是表示整個反攻的時機或條件，或許還沒有完全達到。至於以某種進攻形式爲堅守的手段，那當然是一個重要問題，而爲英·美·蘇三國當局現在不　　目前急於企圖戰局解決的，僅是德·義·日方面。站在中·英·美·蘇集團的立塲，現在並無力求速決的必要。牠們的問題，第一是合作堅守，第二是互相增援，第三是整個聯合反攻。對這個決定性的最後總反攻的到來，我們都望牠可以早日出現，帶給全人類以光明！
With such a situation where the East and West are holding firm and the invading forces have absolutely no future, the most urgent issue now is reinforcement. Recent expressions from all sides in China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries have strongly emphasized this point. Now, all countries must not only make the greatest efforts in weapons and resources, assisting and supplementing each other, but also make further overall coordination and launch in terms of strategy. For example, regarding the defense of Moscow and the resistance in the Donets River basin, what all parties are currently urging is that Britain quickly begin a counteroffensive on the continent, dispersing American forces. However, a striking phenomenon that is noteworthy now is that the official statements of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have not made any formal statements regarding Britain launching a counteroffensive. Of course, this is by no means an accidental phenomenon. We must point out that in the Moscow Three-Power Conference held at the beginning of this month, this whole issue of strategic coordination should have been discussed long ago no matter what. Then, the silence of the three countries' officials now, to speculate, of course, firstly indicates that they are absolutely confident in the Soviet Union's resistance strength. Secondly, it indicates that the timing or conditions for the entire counteroffensive may not have been fully reached yet. As for using some form of offensive as a means of holding fast, that is certainly an important issue, and it is what the authorities of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are not... Currently, only Germany, Italy, and Japan are eager to try to resolve the war situation. Standing on the position of the China-Britain-America-Soviet Union group, there is no need to seek a quick decision now. Their problems are, first, cooperative defense, second, mutual reinforcement, and third, a complete joint counteroffensive. We all hope that this decisive final general counteroffensive will appear as soon as possible and bring light to all mankind!

南路前綫局勢嚴重　英蘇將採聯合行動
The Situation on the Southern Front is Serious: Britain and the Soviet Union Will Take Joint Action

　　蘇聯南部前綫局勢嚴重、英國各報乃預料將有聯合保衛高加索油田之計劃、泰晤士報軍事訪員稱、蘇方最嚴重之危險、在其極左翼、而卡柯夫乃蘇聯南部最重要之地、其工業與羅斯托夫城、至少巳在危險中、高加索區所產之油、此前必有大部份經羅斯托夫運出、土京方面傳冬季在高加索作戰、或非德方能力所及、故德軍諒將以亞斯屈拉坎爲此後之日標、蓋此舉可截斷另一運油路綫、並阻得經伊朗運蘇之接濟品也、惟泰晤士報訪員對此可能性、頗表懷疑、據謂德軍從自下佔領地進窺亞斯屈拉坎、距離極遠、進兵困難云、又據每日簡報稱、協的國業已擬定高加索聯防計劃、以抗德軍可能的侵入、而華維爾將軍將率雄兵百萬、其配備係經紅海路綫運到之美國精良武器、蘇軍從伊朗北部撤退、將闢英軍入蘇之途、而巳在原則接受對蘇聯聯盟建議之伊朗政府、已派閣員組委員會、考量三國政府間軍事合作事宜、預料此三國所訂條的之條款、將與英埃盟的大致相同、
The situation on the southern front of the Soviet Union is serious. British newspapers are predicting a joint plan to defend the Caucasus oil fields. The Times military correspondent stated that the most serious danger to the Soviet side is on its extreme left flank, and Kharkov is the most important place in southern Soviet Union. Its industry and the city of Rostov are at least already in danger. Most of the oil produced in the Caucasus region must have been transported out through Rostov before this. From Ankara, it is reported that winter operations in the Caucasus may not be within the capabilities of the German side, so the German army is expected to target Astrakhan as its next goal, as this move would cut off another oil transport line and prevent supplies from being transported to the Soviet Union via Iran. However, the Times correspondent expressed considerable skepticism about this possibility, saying that it is a very long distance from the German army's occupied territories to Astrakhan, and it would be difficult to advance. Also, according to the Daily Brief, the Allied countries have already drafted a joint defense plan for the Caucasus to resist a possible German invasion. General Wavell will lead a million-strong army, equipped with sophisticated American weapons transported via the Red Sea route. The Soviet army's withdrawal from northern Iran will open the way for British troops to enter the Soviet Union, and the Iranian government, which has accepted the principle of alliance with the Soviet Union, has sent cabinet members to form a committee to consider military cooperation between the three governments. It is expected that the terms of the treaty signed by the three countries will be roughly the same as those of the Anglo-Egyptian alliance.

According to the Soviet communiqué yesterday, fierce fighting took place in the Kharkov, Taganrog, Mozhaisk, and Maloyaroslavets sectors. Eight German planes were shot down near Moscow yesterday. The German side only mentioned successes on the Eastern Front, followed by a description of Italian victories in the south. From this, it can be seen that there are no important developments on the extremely important central front. The German advance in the south is undoubtedly quite important, but it has not decided the whole issue. The decisive results can be obtained on the Moscow front. Hitler has launched the last major offensive before winter in this area. Its future will have extremely serious repercussions for the entire Nazi regime. This does not mean that if Moscow does not hold, Soviet resistance will end. No matter how the war develops, Stalin will continue to fight, and he will not hesitate to move behind the Ural Mountains. This is beyond doubt. However, if the German army benefits in Moscow, this will have enormous spiritual value for Hitler, and all aspects, even far away in the Pacific, will immediately feel its impact. On the other hand, the German army cannot pause midway between victory and defeat. In other words, if the German command cannot lead its troops into Moscow, there will no longer be a stalemate. It will be a complete defeat, and the trend of the German army's invincibility will change from then on. The German people are now all eagerly awaiting news from Moscow. What they are concerned about is not the situation of victories elsewhere, but only the situation on the central front. The weather now seems to be conducive to the defense of the Soviet army, but the Soviet army defending Moscow will not reduce its courage and fighting spirit because of this. In front of the defense lines of Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets, which are closer to Moscow, the German army is very close, but the most important position on the Moscow front seems to be in Kalinin, where several railways converge. If the German army gets it, it can advance to the northeast or southeast, threatening Moscow's traffic to the north or northeast. However, the Soviet army is defending Kalinin extremely resolutely and has not retreated.
