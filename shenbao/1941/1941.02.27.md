### US Senate Naval Affairs Committee Passes Funding for Fortifications on Pacific Islands, Totaling Over 200 Million Yuan; House Also Approves Appropriations for Coastal Installations

WASHINGTON – The Senate Naval Affairs Committee unanimously passed yesterday a naval expansion bill totaling $242,373,500, which includes $4,700,000 for small-scale fortifications on Guam. When Senator Gillette, a Democrat from Iowa, was asked whether the Guam project would cause a reaction in the Far East, he reportedly said, "I cannot answer a single word." Rear Admiral Moreell, Chief of the Navy's Civil Engineers, testified that the Navy urgently needs the Kanoehe Bay seaplane base in Hawaii to alleviate overcrowding at the Ford Island air base. The Navy plans to station ten seaplane squadrons at Kanoehe Bay. He also stated that the Navy is rapidly constructing underground oil storage facilities in Hawaii, with tunnels reaching 300 feet underground. This bill was passed by the House of Representatives last week and sent to the Senate. It must be approved by the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, with a favorable recommendation, before being submitted to the Senate for debate. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives passed a bill on the 19th of this month proposing an appropriation of $142,373,500 as funding for fortifications on US-owned islands in the Pacific, namely Guam and the Samoa Islands. The bill was immediately submitted to the Senate for discussion. The Senate Naval Affairs Committee submitted it for review this month and unanimously passed it. Rear Admiral Moreell defended the bill in a speech before the vote, stating that fortifications on Guam and the Samoa Islands are critical to American survival. He added that the bases recently ceded to the United States by Great Britain should also begin fortifications. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

WASHINGTON – Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, told reporters yesterday that the Guam and Samoa defense plan is essential to American national defense and its implementation is fully justified. He announced that the entire Naval Affairs Committee fully supports the fortifications on Guam (located south of Japan, only 1,500 miles from Japan) and Samoa. Rear Admiral Moreell, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, said he wants to turn Samoa into a large air force base. When a Senator asked Moreell if the Navy feels that Guam is strategically disadvantageous because it is located in the center of Japanese mandated territories, Moreell replied that American planes are currently flying to and from the Philippines and need Guam as an aviation station between Hawaii and the Philippines. He also said that the Navy plans to clear the coral reefs in the harbor within six months and tentatively plans to build a breakwater, which will take 18 months. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives yesterday passed by a large majority an appropriation of $122,802,883 for the construction of coastal facilities, including $17,179,000 for the Hawaiian region. The total amount approved for coastal facilities this week has reached $365,000,000. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

WASHINGTON – The process of debating the Fourth Supplemental National Defense Appropriation Act was released today, showing that the United States is actively expanding its naval and land forces in the Philippines. Both the naval and land forces are prepared to continue expanding and improving coastal defense facilities that have not been touched for six years. Naval officials told the House Appropriations Committee that the Navy needs $1.6 million to build an ammunition depot in Mariveles, Philippines. This project was first considered in 1918. Regarding this matter, Chief Engineer Moreell said that the project could not proceed due to the uncertainty of the status of the Philippine Islands. The recent military position of the Philippines has made the Navy hopeful of building an ammunition depot there. The Navy has also requested $12,000 to improve the Cavite Naval Air Station in the Philippines and $100,000 to repair the Dewey dry dock at the Olongapo Naval Station. The Army has requested $500,000 to build hard-surfaced roads for the Philippine Army Air Station and station two new pursuit squadrons there, plus $185,000 for various construction projects for the Quartermaster Corps and $120,000 to improve the buildings and equipment at the Philippine Army Station. These defense expenditures for the Philippines will be requested in the same budget proposal as the Navy's request for $4.7 million to improve the harbor of Guam and $8.1 million to build air stations in Samoa and Tutuila.

Roosevelt and Congressional Leaders Discuss Amendments to Lend-Lease Act

WASHINGTON – President Roosevelt and congressional leaders discussed multiple amendments to the Lend-Lease Act yesterday, but when the President received reporters, he declined to release the details of the discussion, only stating that any amendments aimed at changing American policy of assisting Great Britain short of entering the war are clearly inappropriate. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

WASHINGTON – The Senate continued to debate the Lend-Lease Act heatedly yesterday. Senator Barbour, a Republican from New Jersey, said that the British fleet is the main shield for the defense of the Western Hemisphere. If the British fleet is seized or destroyed, it will make the unprepared United States bear the full responsibility for defending the Western Hemisphere. He argued that the United States should do everything possible to help Great Britain survive. Senator Murray, a Democrat from Montana, warned the Senate that if Hitler wins, free enterprise will end, and totalitarianism and socialism will occur. He also said that the Rome-Tokyo-Berlin Axis has threatened the United States from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. If war breaks out in the Pacific, we must obtain the assistance of other friendly nations, just as we are currently planning to assist Great Britain, Greece, and China. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

WASHINGTON – President Roosevelt and several Democratic leaders announced yesterday after a lengthy discussion that they will do their best to get the Lend-Lease Act passed by the Senate on Saturday, regardless of any threats. They also said that they have decided to oppose any amendments that would weaken the President's power. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

INDIANAPOLIS – Republican leader Willkie said in a speech to the Indiana State Legislature yesterday that if the United States adopts an isolationist path, it will be contrary to the great spirit that created the United States and Indiana. No one can say that our way of life will survive forever. If we, as the nation leading free people, do not transcend old-fashioned political perspectives, we will cause the collapse of our own way of life. Although there are now five thousand miles of ocean separating us from Hitler's power, this is only temporary. Appeasers are enemies of society in this time of crisis. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

### US Continues to Expand Scope of Embargo

WASHINGTON – President Roosevelt issued a proclamation yesterday that, effective immediately, airplanes, electrodes, pencil lead, etc., are subject to export licensing. Effective March 10, belladonna and atropine (both poison names) and two other items will also require export licenses. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

LONDON – Minister of Commerce Lyttelton replied in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon to a question about British exports to Japan in the past twelve months, saying that no permits have been issued during the war for the shipment of automotive parts from Great Britain to Japan.

### Australian Deputy Prime Minister Declares Readiness to Repel Invasion; Quadruple Alliance of Britain, US, Australia, and the Netherlands East Indies Can Deal Japan a Fatal Blow

SYDNEY – Deputy Prime Minister Fadden stated yesterday that Australia's defense is fully completed and warned that if anyone moves further south, Australians will move further north. Fadden also said, "I do not want to be an alarmist, but war is moving so quickly that it would be foolish for the government not to be extremely prepared to protect Australia." (United Press dispatch, 26th)

LONDON – Well-informed sources say that Japan is troubled by the increasingly tough attitude of Britain and the United States, and the active precautionary measures taken by the two countries. London sources believe that the Soviet Union can hardly remain neutral, but fully supports the strong attitude of Britain and the United States. The rumor that the Soviet Union and Japan will reach an agreement is a deliberately misleading propaganda to make Britain and the United States believe that Japanese commerce has obtained security guarantees. In short, everyone believes that no matter what the situation, the Soviet Union's policy towards China will remain unchanged. As for Matsuoka's mediation of the European war, it cannot be regarded as the disappearance of the Far Eastern crisis, because Japanese warships are patrolling in the Gulf of Thailand, and Japanese troops in Vietnam are controlling important entrances. As for Japan not asking Thailand and Vietnam to grant new rights as compensation for Japan's mediation of the Thailand-Vietnam dispute, it cannot be regarded as Japan's statement that it has given up its southward ambitions. On the contrary, Tokyo is waiting for Hitler to order the simultaneous launch of offensives in the West and the Far East. Therefore, the proposal for Japan to mediate the European war cannot stop Britain, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands from jointly taking precautionary measures in the Pacific. In fact, the four countries in the Pacific have a closer cooperation. (25th dispatch)

CHONGQING – The Ta Kung Pao editorial advocates that Britain, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands East Indies form a quadruple alliance in the Pacific, stating that the recently strengthened Pacific Fleet of the United States, with the use of Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand naval bases, can become a powerful enemy. The Netherlands East Indies has three cruisers, eight destroyers, one Australian squadron, eight mine-laying ships, and eight minesweepers. If the situation in the Mediterranean is favorable to Britain, part of the British fleet can be sent to the Far East. The Philippines has one hundred airfields, including two specially prepared military airfields. The Netherlands East Indies also has eleven airfields. Malaya has at least twenty. In the past eight years, the Netherlands East Indies has purchased a total of 1,800 aircraft. The combined air power of the four countries cannot be matched by Japan, because Japan does not have a strong air force. The naval and economic blockade of the four powers in the Pacific can deal Japan a fatal blow. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

BATAVIA – At six o'clock yesterday morning, people here were awakened by the sound of alarms, which marked the start of a three-day air defense exercise throughout Java. This exercise is no different from real wartime to show the efficiency of air defense and to give the public air defense knowledge. Partial blackouts will also be implemented. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

### Observers Speculate US-Japan Peace or War Issue Will Reach a Decisive Moment Within Three Months; Soviet Attitude is Particularly Critical

NEW YORK – Experts believe that the issue of US-Japan peace or war will reach a decisive moment within ninety days. According to observers in Tokyo and Washington, it will depend on the attitude of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union holds a position of great importance in Asia, just as it does in Europe. What action Stalin will take is a mystery. The situation can be roughly analyzed as follows: The United States is eager for the Soviet Union to continue to be close to prevent the establishment of a Soviet-Japanese understanding. If this understanding is established, the fierce edge of the Japanese navy can be shifted towards the United States. The difficulty in US-Soviet rapprochement is the position of Great Britain. The Soviet Union insists that the United States must allow the Soviet Union to freely purchase unlimited goods as the price for being tough on Japan. If the United States agrees, the Soviet Union can sell its own raw materials such as cotton to Germany, and purchase its own needs from the United States. In this way, the British blockade will be ineffective. Therefore, the US "appeasement policy" towards the Soviet Union will inevitably be theoretical, and cannot be practical, because US policy is to ensure British victory, and it cannot take any action that would lead to the defeat of Britain. In addition, Washington will promote Soviet aid to China and prevent the establishment of Soviet-Japanese treaties, believing that Japan's first step is to not invade. Germany is trying to woo the two countries, and its efforts are extremely intense, with the aim of making its ally Japan worry-free. When Hitler launches a large-scale attack on the British Isles, the United States will be tied down by Japan in the Pacific. It is also very possible for Germany and the Soviet Union to jointly mediate the Sino-Japanese War. Japan only seeks not to lose face and is eager to resolve it. If Berlin's efforts to foster Japanese-Soviet friendship are successful, Hitler will gain another great diplomatic victory, which is as important as the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty. Analysts all admit the superior position of Xinjiang, equality of rights in all of China with Japan, and the perfectly seamless guarantee that Japan will not invade Asia. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

### US Plans to Place Greenland Under Protective Umbrella

WASHINGTON – It is heard that the United States has adopted a "common sense" definition of the boundaries of the Western Hemisphere, listing Greenland, a vast territory of Denmark, within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine and under the protection of the US government. Qualified sources reveal that the President's concern is that it will advance south and control the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, British Malaya, and Thailand. Tokyo has spread the news that the promotion of Soviet-Japanese friendship is in progress, with the intention of Japan eagerly obtaining Soviet assistance to end the war against China, and signing a Japanese-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty. Japan has already shown signs of making concessions to the Soviet Union, which can be seen in the one-year fishery agreement signed this time. Japan's move is to pave the way for the signing of a permanent fishery agreement and a commercial treaty. These two treaties are also to obtain Soviet goodwill and sign an agreement without recognizing Stalin as an onlooker watching from the sidelines, while doing everything possible to avoid war, putting party lines out of mind. He may wish to see his powerful potential enemy exhausted in the war, while Germany and Japan may also be seen by him as potential enemies. The Soviets have always regarded an independent and friendly China as a necessary condition for Soviet security. This is the main reason why the Soviet Union has continuously aided China. The Soviet Union is now demanding the highest price from Japan, and its major conditions include the restoration of the old Soviet rights in the North Sea, such as the Chinese Eastern Railway, etc. In the new policy decision-makers decide that the Western Hemisphere should be bounded by the 30th meridian west of Greenwich in the Atlantic Ocean and the 180th meridian west of Greenwich in the Pacific Ocean. This provision will place Greenland under the protection of the American Monroe Doctrine. (International News Service dispatch, 26th)

Editorial

### Analysis of Matsuoka's Diplomacy

When Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka answered questions in the Diet on the fourth of this month, he stated: "As long as it benefits Japan, two-sided, three-sided, or even multi-faceted diplomacy can be adopted." Judging from the recent diplomatic trends of Japan, Matsuoka is indeed trying the theory he has longed for.

Compared with his predecessors Arita, Nomura, and even Ugaki Hirota, Matsuoka is indeed more active. He does not cling to one belief like his predecessors, nor does he consider what consequences his speeches and steps will have. He speaks more rashly and engages in more rash maneuvering. However, as soon as he encounters major reactions and obstacles, he immediately turns around and adopts a different face and tone to deal with it. Therefore, even if people remove abstract terms such as "Establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and "Absolute Loyalty to the Tripartite Alliance," it is not easy to understand the true meaning of Matsuoka's diplomacy. However, everyone is familiar with his style. The so-called multi-faceted diplomacy is undoubtedly the true face of Matsuoka's diplomacy, although it does not seem to be very harmonious with the Tripartite Pact.

Since the Far East crisis suddenly became serious, Japan has shown an active posture in diplomacy: The Japanese military mission sent to Germany and Italy has already reached Germany, and the technical committee of the Tripartite Pact has also been formally established; for the Soviet Union, economic talks between the two countries began on the 17th, and it is urgently seeking the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty; for the units in Southeast Asia, on the one hand, it continues to carry out economic negotiations with the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam, and on the other hand, it is directing the cessation of hostilities and peace talks between Thailand and Vietnam; for the United States, in addition to trying to ease the American aversion and pressure with Nomura's assistance, it has repeatedly expressed Japan's "peaceful" intention; especially for the United Kingdom, on the 17th, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu visited British Foreign Secretary Butler to explain the Japanese attitude and presented Matsuoka's so-called ceasefire proposal. On the 24th, British Prime Minister Churchill also summoned Shigemitsu for a meeting, handed over a British memorandum, and clarified the British basic attitude towards Japan. In addition to the above-mentioned contacts, Matsuoka has repeatedly made various diplomatic replies in the Diet, and especially the declaration on the 24th that Oceania should be given to Asians is the most stimulating to the world's attention. Such frivolousness and manipulation show an active diplomatic posture and adequately expose its lack of belief and sincerity, but only adopts a perfunctory attitude to deal with it in many ways. This is not only true for the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but even for its close Axis allies; its recent diplomatic use of the United Kingdom, although it is his consistent means of use, deliberately shows that it has not completely entrusted all its future to the alliance relationship on the Axis side. This kind of diplomacy is neither innovative nor conservative, and can only be regarded as opportunistic expediency.

Observing such a multi-faceted relationship, it is not without a sense of urgency and importance: compared with Germany and Italy and the Soviet Union, it only hopes to maintain the existing alliance with the former and wait for future developments, while it is eagerly seeking to achieve something in diplomatic relations with the latter; between the United Kingdom and the United States, it only hopes to ease its aversion and pressure on the United States for a while, while it has major fantasies and even conspiracies about the United Kingdom. Originally, dividing the policies of the United Kingdom and the United States towards the Far East has been a consistent tradition of Japanese diplomacy in recent years, and it has not always failed to achieve temporary and local effects, especially in the two periods before the outbreak of the European war and after the defeat of France, but the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact ultimately promoted the realization of Anglo-American cooperation in the Far East; in the past five months, the United Kingdom and the United States have always adopted parallel policies, and the recent implementation of emergency facilities has opened a new era in the Far East crisis. However, although the positions of the United Kingdom and the United States are the same, their situations are very different. The United States has full freedom of use in the Western Pacific, while the United Kingdom cannot be unaffected by the European war, and in the actual strategic situation in the Far East, before the United States has completed its defense arrangements for the Western Pacific and most of its fleet has not crossed west of Hawaii, it still mainly relies on the British land and sea strength to support it. In addition, the remnants of appeasement in the United Kingdom still have considerable influence, and there are still illusions that Japan will separate from Germany and Italy. These situations are all factors that arouse Japanese fantasies, and also explain the recent frequent diplomatic contacts between the United Kingdom and Japan, and even the reason why Matsuoka has uniquely launched his peace offensive towards the United Kingdom.

Churchill's statement when he met Shigemitsu that "British defense in the Far East is only of a self-defense nature and is not an offensive measure against Japan" may make people wonder whether it is a revival of the Chamberlain-Clerk policy line in the past; in fact, the increased defense of the Malay and Australian troops, the deployment of mines in the strait, and the previous actual war preparations are more than this diplomatic wording to express the British recent sincere attitude. It is certainly true that the British authorities do not want the war to spread to the Far East in order to deal with Germany wholeheartedly, but these are all relative and limited, because the United Kingdom has learned from its past mistakes and can believe that the British will not pay a heavy price for this. Moreover, the greatest decision-making power in the Far East issue lies with the United States. When the United States fully supports English, the British Far East policy will not be too far away from the United States, and at the same time, it can be seen that the plan to divide the Anglo-American formation in the Far East will never achieve any success. If Matsuoka's proposal to give Oceania to Asians is based on his fantasies about the United Kingdom and is proposed as an exchange condition, the Australian government has given a clear answer: "The more the Japanese advance south, the more the Australians advance north." And the future of Matsuoka's multi-faceted diplomacy will eventually only fade away with the advance and retreat of Japan.

### Japan Plots to Break the Thai-Vietnamese Impasse

Tokyo. According to well-informed Japanese sources, Japan has proposed a compromise to break the deadlock in the Thai-Vietnamese negotiations. This proposal is Japan's final contribution to these negotiations. The land to be ceded to Thailand should historically belong to Thailand.

### Konoe Answers Questions from Assemblymen

Tokyo. Japanese Prime Minister Konoe today replied in writing to questions from Ozaki and 30 other assemblymen, stating that the current government is not pessimistic about the future diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States. The government firmly believes that if the path it is seeking is not wrong, there is no need to have any fears, so it is determined to make Britain and the United States understand Japan's true intentions. Although relations with Britain and the United States are extremely complex at present, if Japan explains to the two countries with a very clear attitude and facts, such as not seeking reparations or territory from China, it will not be difficult to gain their understanding. Also, in the question, there was an item: "Why did Konoe's great declaration on settling the China incident cause a bad reaction from China?" Konoe replied that this was due to Chongqing's counter-propaganda and the inability of the United States and Britain to understand Japan's true intentions. The question also criticized how the Japanese cabinet had changed four times since the Sino-Japanese War. Konoe replied that as long as the Emperor trusts me for one day, I will serve for one day.

### The Yunnan-Burma Road is Open for Freight Transport

Lashio. A Reuters reporter, accompanying ten transport trucks, traveled the Yunnan-Burma Road for ten days, finding that the road will never be cut off by aerial bombardment, unless the road is occupied by Japanese troops at some point. Transport between Burma and China will not be significantly disrupted. Chinese people have used their ingenuity to devise clever ferry systems, so that 100 fully loaded trucks can be ferried across the river every day. New roads are being built, and this method will soon be used to maximize the safe crossing of trucks without relying entirely on bridges. The construction of the ferry is very simple, simply placing planks on empty oil drums and connecting them with chains. A truck pulls it across the ocean. This is done entirely at night, and disassembled completely during the day to avoid Japanese bombing. Even if the ferry is occasionally damaged and unsuitable, another ferry can be set up to replace it without delay or effort. Therefore, if a bridge is damaged and cannot be used, this method can be used to eliminate the difficulty. The bombing damage to the bridges cannot cut off the road's traffic, and the road surface passing through the mountains is not affected by direct bombardment. The road is often in danger of landslides or flooding, so there are a large number of Chinese workers along the road. Any damage is repaired immediately, and it can be passable in a short time. In the past twelve months, including two seasons, the road's transportation has never been interrupted for more than fourteen hours due to natural obstacles. Once you see how easy it is to eliminate such natural obstacles, you will never believe that aerial bombardment can hinder the long and continuous transportation of the road. (26th Reuters Dispatch)

### The Balkan Situation is Evolving British Foreign Secretary Eden and Dill Suddenly Visit Ankara Close Military and Diplomatic Cooperation Expected to be the Main Topic of Discussion Germany Actively Prepares to Invade Bulgaria Sofia Filled with Tense Atmosphere

London. Under German supervision, Bulgarian authorities are rapidly clearing major roads. Many believe that this obvious German preparation to occupy Bulgaria is difficult to reconcile with the recent speech by Bulgaria's new Minister of Agriculture. (26th Reuters Dispatch)

Sofia. Bulgarian newspapers reported yesterday that Bulgaria will have some kind of development in the near future, a development that will surprise the world and cannot be avoided. (26th Huitong Dispatch)

Sofia. Personnel from the German General Staff have taken over the entire town of Koria, which has 200 villas, located 44 miles from Sofia. (26th United Press Dispatch)

Sofia. Although many believe that the Germans have made very detailed preparations to attack Greece through Bulgaria, observers in Sofia believe that the Germans may wait a few days, hoping for good news from the Italian army's operations in Albania. However, the weather is unfavorable to German actions. Repeated storms have made the roads unsuitable for heavy vehicle traffic, and although it is reported that the ice in the Danube River within Hungary has broken, the water level is still high. Sofia believes that the Germans will use the British threat to Bulgaria as an excuse to send troops through Bulgaria. If the Italian army can benefit in Albania without assistance, the Germans may not send troops through Bulgaria, because Greek diplomats stationed in the Balkan Peninsula have stated that Greece will never succumb to threats. Many believe that the resumption of normal traffic on the Romanian railway tomorrow is sufficient to show that German plans in Romania have now been completed. It is reported that several dive bombers have arrived in Romania from Germany. The German air force in Romania has reached about 650 aircraft. These aircraft can be used to assist land offensives. Sofia is still filled with a tense atmosphere of speculation. All cities and towns throughout the country are still summoning soldiers of all ranks to enlist, and Sofia has begun large-scale defense measures. The rumor that the authorities have drafted a joint declaration allowing German troops to occupy key points in Bulgarian territory has not been confirmed in Sofia. (26th Reuters Dispatch)

British and German Forces Promote a Pro-Soviet Policy in Bulgaria

Vichy. According to news from the capitals of Bulgaria and Romania, a political conspiracy was recently uncovered in the Bulgarian capital. The leader of the conspiracy was a "pro-British" secret group, whose headquarters were located in Sofia. After the police authorities discovered it, they sent personnel to arrest many people, including several Macedonians. At the same time, there is considerable unrest in Bulgarian political circles. Many key political figures have met with King Boris to discuss the international situation. After hearing this news, political figures here believe that Bulgaria's internal affairs will soon have a direct impact on the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. Generally speaking, since Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German leader Hitler did not mention the Balkan issue in their recent speeches, and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković visited Hungary, coupled with the establishment of a non-aggression treaty between Turkey and Bulgaria, the situation in Southeast Europe has tended to ease, which is worth noting. Since the end of the last World War, Bulgaria has consistently refused to participate in any political alliance or form an alliance with any country, large or small. But at this time, under pressure from Germany and Britain, although it does not approve of the Soviet system, it has had to promote a "pro-Soviet policy." This is an important element in today's Balkan situation. (25th Vahas Dispatch)

Khartoum. A large contingent of British troops is currently dividing into several routes to attack central Abyssinia, advancing deeper and deeper. It appears that the war in Abyssinia will accelerate, and the Italian army led by the Italian Governor of Abyssinia, Duke Aosta, is in a desperate situation everywhere. Currently, British troops are simultaneously breaking into Abyssinia from the south, northwest, and other sides in more than ten routes, and after the Abyssinians heard the news that the Abyssinian King had returned to his homeland, the number of people joining the patriotic Abyssinian army is increasing daily. The Italian regular army has been subjected to widespread attacks by British troops, and the number of deserters is increasing daily due to persuasion through leaflets and loudspeakers. In recent days, the British army's supply line through the mountainous area has become more and more perfect, and ammunition, medicine, and food have been transported in continuously. The British army's offensive power has greatly increased, and the strength of the British air force is also increasing daily. The British army is now reapplying the tactics of encircling the Italian army and cutting off its communication in places such as Keren in Eritrea, but in some places, the terrain is rugged and it is not convenient to quickly deploy mechanized troops. British infantry always climbs over mountains, destroys roads and bridges, and attacks the Italian army from behind. The Italian side, in addition to the outposts that are currently being withdrawn, its front line seems to start from Keren and attempts to defend Keren to the death. The Italian side is now using its elite white troops and winds south to Lake Tana, and then reaches Addis Ababa through 台勃拉 and 瑪柯斯. (26th Reuters Dispatch)

Moscow: The joint session of the Soviet Union Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities was held last night. Seated at the presiding table were Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Union, and Shvernik, Rasenkov, Yusupov, Chairman of the Council of Nationalities. Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Kaganovich, and others also appeared in the box, receiving a warm welcome from the entire audience. Participants stood and cheered for Stalin for several minutes. The joint session immediately proceeded to discuss the agenda. The first item (approving the 1941 national budget and the report on the implementation of the 1939 budget) was presented by the People's Commissar of Finance. It was stated that the estimated revenue for 1941 is 216,200,000,000 rubles, and the expenditure is 215,400,000,000 rubles. In terms of expenditure, national defense expenditure is 70,865,000,000 rubles, accounting for one-third of the total expenditure (an increase of 13.9 billion rubles compared to the previous year). (TASS dispatch, 26th)

Finance Minister's Report: In the joint session of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities in Moscow last night, Soviet People's Commissar of Finance Zverev delivered a report stating, "During the three years of the Third Five-Year Plan, investment in socialist construction exceeded 45 billion rubles. During this period, the economic and military strength of the Soviet Union has been enhanced, and the Soviet Union's territory has also been expanded. The Soviet Union now has 16 strong constituent republics. The Soviet government strongly requests the Congress to approve the budget, with an estimated revenue of 216,200,000,000 rubles and an expenditure of 215,400,000,000 rubles. In other words, the revenue exceeds the expenditure by 788 million rubles. The estimated federal revenue is 170,200,000,000 rubles, and the revenue of the republics and local areas is 46,000,000,000 rubles, an increase of 21.4% compared to 1940. The increase in revenue is due to the increase in industrial output. The sources of revenue include 124,500,000,000 rubles from national and cooperative organization turnover tax, 31,251,000,000 rubles from profit tax, 9,998,000,000 rubles from the state social security fund, 2,603,000,000 rubles from tractor station revenue, 3,230,000,000 rubles from state loans, and 12,451,000,000 rubles from other taxes collected from the public."

The Increase in Tax Revenue: is a natural result of the increase in socialist production and trade. In 1941, the Soviet Union's industrial output will reach 162,000,000,000 rubles, an increase of 17% to 18% compared to 1940. The total retail sales volume will also increase from 174,500,000,000 rubles to 197,000,000,000 rubles. As for the income from national bonds and bank savings, 60 million people purchased the Third Five-Year Plan bonds in 1940, totaling 9,433,000,000 rubles. In 1940, the government issued 900,000,000 rubles in bond interest, a significant increase compared to the 550,000,000 rubles in 1939. Bank deposits have also increased, currently reaching 70 billion rubles.

In terms of expenditure, the following has been stipulated: 72,875,000,000 rubles for the national economy, an increase of 27.6%, including 139,181,000,000 rubles for the industrial sector (an increase of 41.1%), 13,455,000,000 rubles for the agricultural sector (an increase of 10.6%), 6,576,000,000 rubles for the transportation sector (an increase of 4.1%), 47,803,000,000 rubles for the social and cultural sector (an increase of 14.6%), and 70,865,000,000 rubles for the People's Commissariat of National Defense and Navy of the Soviet Union, an increase of 26.3%. In addition, 57 billion rubles have also been stipulated for major construction expenditures in 1941.

Agricultural investment will reach 13.5 billion rubles, with 387 new tractor stations planned in the Baltic republics. Regarding social and cultural expenditures, the main part is the support for various schools, universities, and specialized schools. In 1941-1942, the number of students in primary and secondary schools will reach 36.2 million, with 9.5 billion rubles allocated for primary and secondary schools (8.7 billion rubles in 1940), 2.299 billion rubles for higher education institutions, and 1,551,000,000 rubles for specialized schools.

National Defense Expenditure

During the joint session of the Soviet Supreme Council in Moscow last night, Finance Minister Zverev, when referring to national defense expenditure, stated, "The Soviet Union pursues a policy of peace, but will never ignore developments outside its borders. The current dire international situation has forced our country to adopt various methods to enhance the national defense capabilities of our socialist motherland. The Soviet government proposes that the Presidium of the Supreme Council immediately approve the national defense budget of 70,900,000,000 rubles." After Zverev finished speaking, everyone stood up and cheered for Stalin for a long time. This fully demonstrated the unshakable will of Soviet patriotism and the Soviet people, and their determination to continue to strengthen national defense.

Zverev continued, "The Soviet national economy has a great deal of storage. We should make full use of this storage to increase income and the strength of the socialist country. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the great Stalin, we are advancing towards communism." Zverev's speech aroused great cheers, and everyone stood up and enthusiastically cheered "Long live Stalin," the organizer and promoter of socialist victory. The cheers included several languages ​​and lasted for several minutes, shaking the Kremlin. (TASS dispatch, 26th)

### Full Text of Hitler's Speech

German Economic Policy

We should adhere to an economic policy that benefits the German nation. The government's economic policy should be based on the interests of the entire people and should not be built on a capitalist foundation. The people must have a day of awakening, so any country that implements a capitalist economic policy will inevitably face financial collapse as a result. After the victory of this war, the gold standard will gradually lose its effectiveness. In the future, people will no longer conduct their business through banks, but will be replaced by barter and clearing systems. Germany is a major factor in production and consumption, so other nations will voluntarily engage in commerce with Germany, regardless of the attitude of the banks. I have never asked the United States or other countries to lend gold, because we do not need gold. Let them keep their gold. However, our country's economic policy will never be like what bankers in New York or London say, and fall into depression. To know that Germany's economic policy is solely based on the interests of the entire nation as the sole premise. I have repeatedly made suggestions to Britain and France, but Britain and France have always ignored them and regarded them as ridiculous and absurd. From this, we can see that it is necessary

Forced to Resort to War

Recently, a certain American general declared in the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that Churchill had stated to him in 1936 that Germany was becoming increasingly strong and Britain must find a way to destroy it. Since then, Churchill has been preparing to destroy Germany. At that time, I warned him, but a certain political party in Britain, instigated by Jews, was single-mindedly in need of war. It was hopeless to save. So I implemented arming the whole country. You all know that once I say something, I will definitely carry it out. Now it has been a great success. The achievements of military preparations in a few years can be proud of globally. Today, the German people are united, and the people and the party and army are united in spirit, defending the country together. Therefore, to say that Germany will repeat the defeat of 1918 is nothing more than foolishness. Our country's enemies once said that Germany would have a revolution within six weeks of the outbreak of the war, but they did not specify which German generals would lead this revolution. Germany does not have revolutionary elements. Britain and the United States do. They are willing to set up their headquarters in countries far away from the battlefield. I really don’t know who will lead the revolution in Germany, and I don’t know how the revolution will happen. But one thing I know is that there are some fools in Germany, but they will never launch a revolution. The enemy also said that Germany would succumb to winter, but Germany has now survived this winter. I don’t know what the enemy thinks. I believe that it will be the enemy countries, not our country, that will experience famine. I dare to say that the enemy's hopes are all fantasies.

Holding the Belief of Victory

I am honored to have experienced this vigorous war. The time has come for Germany to exert its power. I am waiting for the opportunity to lead millions of troops to attack the enemy and defeat them in one fell swoop. The German National Socialist Party will witness 1941 as the year of decisive battle. This is the firm belief held by all our party members. We believe in the justice of the world. We believe that years of hard struggle will surely lead to victory. Now there is one thing I want to announce to you all, that is, I am not afraid when I look at the enemy. I know that every political leader of the enemy represents the interests of their own class. Those who support them are either Jews or money. I know that the people of the enemy will be the executors of the will of our country's people. I firmly believe that after this war, God will bless the German nation again.

Twenty years ago, when I first stepped into this tavern, I had no fame or great achievements. The ambition I had at that time was to create a new world in these twenty-one years. I dare to say that the road our party comrades will take in the future will be much easier than the road they have traveled in the past twenty-one years. Today, Germany will move forward bravely and continue to move forward. After Hitler finished speaking, all the old party members shouted the slogan "Forward" and dispersed.

### While Japan Watches the Southward Advance, the United States Should Step Up Aid to China; the US President's Representative Has Suggested Three Items, But They Must Be Utilized in a Timely Manner and Expedited; Local Western Newspapers Expound on the Gains and Losses of Immediate Action

The editorial of the Continental Daily News stated, "Dr. Currie, the personal representative of US President Roosevelt, and Mr. Tydings, an American economist, came to China to investigate how to assist the Chongqing government. Now, as they are about to return to the United States, if anyone hopes that these two will return home and accelerate US aid to China, then this kind of hope is very reasonable. These two distinguished guests have closely studied the wartime situation in China and what is needed to achieve success. They will soon fly back to the United States to report the results of their investigation to the White House."

Suggest Increasing Aid to China

According to reports in Chongqing newspapers, Dr. Currie has maintained close contact with Washington since arriving in Chongqing. It is said that Dr. Currie even suggested to President Roosevelt to increase aid to China and provide more loans: first, to develop industry in western China; second, to stabilize China's legal tender; and third, to strengthen China's military institutions. Although these suggestions seem to be made too early before Mr. Currie returns to the United States, it can be asserted that Mr. Currie will accelerate American aid to China's economic and military needs after arriving in Washington.

The Quantity That Can Be Given Is Very Large

Mr. Currie's views have been stated without reservation in his speeches. At the reception hosted by the Sino-American Cultural Association and the Chongqing Harvard Alumni Association, Mr. Currie gave a speech saying, "China asks for very little, and the United States can give very much. I firmly believe that we will never let you down." There is no doubt that the United States will not let China down. President Roosevelt has repeatedly assured that the United States will help countries resisting aggression everywhere so that they can continue to fight against totalitarian countries. The question is, what are the most needed things for these countries that are fighting resolutely? This is the reason why Dr. Currie and Mr. Tydings were ordered to come to China to investigate.

Immediate Action Cannot Be Delayed

We hope that after the investigation of American aid to China has been completed, it should be launched immediately without delay. Japanese warships are already taking harmful actions in the South Pacific. If their ambition to establish the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is not eliminated, then the South Pacific may have the possibility of igniting the flames of war. Therefore, the United States should take advantage of this opportunity while Japan is still watching the development of Europe and immediately transport all kinds of necessities to China. It would be too late if we waited until the Japanese navy had completed the blockade of the entire coastline of the Asian continent. The need for American aid to China is really easy. As Dr. Currie said, what China needs is limited.

### British Ambassador to Arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong Next Week

Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, and his wife, after residing in Chongqing for a long time, flew to Hong Kong the day before yesterday (25th). It is reported that they will take a ship from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Upon inquiry with the British Embassy Office, it was learned that the Ambassador arrived in Hong Kong yesterday and will stay in Hong Kong for several days. We have not yet received any telegrams regarding which ship he will take to Shanghai. However, it is believed that if the Ambassador comes to Shanghai, the date will be next week. It is also learned that after the British Ambassador comes to Shanghai this time, he will stay in Shanghai for several months if the situation does not change.

### Savings Bonds Reach 10 Million Yuan, Bank Deposits Rebound

According to recent news from financial circles, Shanghai residents have purchased savings bonds for national reconstruction, which has reached a total of 10 million yuan. Since the Pacific war clouds have spread and the speculative market has been constantly turbulent, those who used to compete to buy foreign currency and were fascinated by speculation have been awakened. They all feel that the best guarantee for funds is to rely on the motherland. It is reported that ordinary deposits and savings deposits in various banks in Shanghai, whether official or commercial, have seen a sharp increase. This not only shows that the people's confidence in the legal tender is becoming more firm, but also shows signs that the escaped funds are returning. It is generally predicted that the savings for national reconstruction movement will be widely expanded in the future, and guiding the city's floating capital to develop the mainland industry can also enter the practical stage.

### Signing to Comfort Britain Movement, All Circles Respond Enthusiastically, This Move Further Strengthens the Alliance Between China and Britain to Strive Together to Defend Freedom and Justice

China was the first to launch an offensive against aggression and fought against Japan. Under the leadership of wise leaders, relying on the vastness of human and material resources and the concentration of will and spirit, China laid the foundation for final victory. However, the assistance and support given to China by friendly countries in material and spiritual aspects have undoubtedly given China great help and encouragement, which the Chinese people deeply appreciate and will never forget. Now, the friendly country of China, Britain, also shares the same goal as China and is fighting to the death against the aggressor countries. This is what the Chinese people express sympathy and admiration for, and feel that there should be a kind of expression to convey friendship to friends in need, and further increase the close relationship between the two major anti-aggression nations of the East and West. Therefore, local Chinese figures in Shanghai initiated a movement to sign and comfort Britain, drafted a telegram to comfort British Prime Minister Churchill, and submitted it to the Sino-American Daily to publish and entrusted the newspaper to plan and carry it out. Now, the newspaper has received a response from the majority of readers, stipulated methods, officially implemented it, and widely promoted it. Schools, shops, factories, companies, and public groups have responded to this movement. It is hoped that those who agree will enthusiastically sign their names (please use a brush and black ink to write on domestic paper) and send them to the newspaper for collection. The newspaper will hire famous calligraphers to carefully write the telegram of condolences, and list all the names of those who agree, mount them into a hand scroll, and properly send it to the British government for safekeeping. This move will surely give the British government and the public a great spiritual warmth, and further strengthen the good relationship between the two countries, jointly seek to achieve the goal of defending freedom and democracy, and build a truly peaceful world. Moreover, national diplomacy is also unfolding here, with profound significance. The opportunity is convenient and easy. There is no better opportunity than this. It is also learned that after the launch of this movement, Reuters News Agency in Shanghai has sent a telegram to report to London.

### Colonel Hampson Left Shanghai Yesterday to Return to England and Rejoin the Military; More Than 200 American Evacuees; the President Pierce to Arrive in Shanghai on August 8

Colonel Hampson, the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, was relieved of his post at midnight on the 15th and handed it over to Lieutenant Colonel Mann. Yesterday (26th), he boarded the President Coolidge (13,029 tons), a passenger liner, to go to the United States, and then returned to his country to rejoin the military and lead a regiment to serve the country. Many of Colonel Hampson's friends and his successor, Lieutenant Colonel Mann, went to the Customs Wharf at 10 o'clock yesterday morning to see him off. Colonel Hampson came to Shanghai in December 1937, succeeding Colonel Graham as the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. At that time, the situation was difficult. Thanks to Colonel Hampson's hard work and planning, the standard of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was improved and it was recognized as an elite militia force.

Well-Known Figures Go to the United States on the Same Ship

Also, Nash, the retiring Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, also took the President Coolidge to the United States to reunite with his wife and children.

Shanghai American School Prepares to Evacuate

Shanghai American School held a special school affairs meeting last Saturday to discuss the evacuation issue. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to advise the American teachers of the school to respect the consulate's advice and prepare for evacuation, and to decide to suspend classes from April 17. If the environment changes, it is also possible to suspend classes before April 17. At that time, a temporary notice may be issued, or no notice may be issued, depending on the situation at the time. At the same time, it was also decided that the dormitory would be closed tomorrow, and the boarding students would be taken back by their parents, or entrusted to relatives and friends in Shanghai to take care of them.

The city also has the Guam gunboat, which is stationed at the naval floating dock in the Yangjingbang.

### Japanese Military Authorities Acknowledge that Shanghai-Hangzhou Freight Train Was Bombed; Locomotive and Five Freight Cars Derail; Rumor Is That the Bombing Was Aimed at High-Ranking Japanese Military Officers

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post stated that according to passenger claims, at 7:45 a.m. yesterday (25th), a freight train encountered a landmine explosion near Jiaxing, causing the locomotive and five freight cars to derail. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway traffic was cut off for seven hours. The Japanese military authorities in Shanghai today (26th)

Admit to the Incident

Said that the incident was caused by guerrillas, but no one was injured. It took seven hours to restore normal traffic. According to Chinese sources, the landmine was intended to bomb a passenger train carrying high-ranking Japanese military officers to Hangzhou to attend an important military conference. The Japanese military authorities in Shanghai denied this statement, claiming that there was no

Military Conference Held in Hangzhou

And there are no plans to hold this conference in the short term. The Japanese believe that the landmine was planted by one or two people, because there are not many guerrillas in the area. It is said that the derailment of the freight car was indeed caused by a landmine explosion. This point has been verified by the Japanese military authorities. It is said that the freight car was approaching the Qixing Bridge between Jiaxing and Jiashan (50 miles from Shanghai) when the landmine exploded, causing the locomotive and five freight cars to derail. The Japanese army in Jiaxing rushed to the scene of the accident to investigate, but failed to capture the person who planted the mine. On November 29 last year, a passenger train near Suzhou overturned after hitting a mine, causing many casualties. Soon after, a freight train between Shanghai and Nanjing also derailed near Suzhou.

### Lin Xiongji Escorted to Nagasaki; Scheduled to Leave Shanghai Tomorrow Aboard the Asama Maru

According to the Japanese newspaper "Continental News," Lin Xiongji, the Japanese man who shot and injured the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. K. Okazaki, during the special meeting of ratepayers in the Public Concession last month on the 23rd, has been released on bail after the preliminary hearing by the Japanese Consular Court. He has returned to his residence on Baole'an Road, awaiting trial in Nagasaki. Recently, aside from visiting the Shanghai Shrine, Lin Xiongji has been reading at home, leading a secluded life. It is now reported that he has decided to leave Shanghai, where he has resided for forty years, on the 28th of this month aboard the Asama Maru, and go to his hometown of Osaka to visit his ancestors' graves before awaiting the court's judgment.

Visiting Graves in Osaka

The English "Evening Star" reports that Lin Xiongji (70 years old), the former chairman of the Japanese Residents Association in this city, who was recently charged with shooting and wounding the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and two others at a special meeting of foreign ratepayers in the Public Concession, will leave Shanghai for Japan on the Asama Maru this Friday, where he will face a formal trial in Nagasaki. According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese authorities will allow Lin Xiongji to visit his ancestral graves in Osaka before returning to Nagasaki for a public trial. Lin Xiongji has been residing in his residence on Diswei Road, keeping a low profile for three weeks since the preliminary hearing at the Japanese Consulate in this city after the shooting at the ratepayers' meeting on January 23rd. It is reported that Lin Xiongji shot and wounded the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, K. Okazaki, and two Japanese officials of the Council at the ratepayers' meeting on January 23rd.

### The Establishment of the Huxi Special Police is Temporarily Difficult; Problems Exist with Personnel and Funding; The Final Decision Will Require Considerable Time

The "Special Police Headquarters" for the western district, originally scheduled to be established on March 1st, has been unable to materialize as planned due to the ongoing negotiations between Pan Zhijie and Chrisler. The underlying issues are not widely understood. However, yesterday, the Japanese "Continental News" revealed that the problems lie in personnel and funding. According to the report, "The 'Special Police Headquarters,' originally scheduled to be formally established on March 1st, has been unable to make a final decision due to the need for careful consideration of personnel selection for each district headquarters after continued detailed discussions between Pan Da (i.e., Pan Zhijie) and Chrisler. Therefore, it is difficult to establish on March 1st. It is said that the reason for the delay is largely due to personnel issues and, concerning funding, difficulties arise in receiving the same treatment as the Shanghai Municipal Council. Therefore, the final decision may require considerable time."

### Repeated Obstruction of Japanese Troops; Hongkou Plunged into Chaos; Huang Xiong Shot in Caojiadu

The "China Press" reports that yesterday (the 25th) afternoon, near Qiqihar Road and Pingliang Road in eastern Shanghai, two Chinese men shot and killed Japanese soldier Masakazu Takeda and seriously wounded Corporal Ishii. Japanese sentries stationed nearby heard the gunshots and rushed to pursue the perpetrators, eventually capturing one of the assailants in front of Huishan Park. The other assailant escaped. Afterwards, the Japanese side took strict precautions and conducted a thorough search.

### Inland Students Vigorously Serve the Country Amidst Hardship; Male Students Economize on Food and Clothing, Wear Broken Socks and Shoes; Female Students Eager to Enlist, Travel Long Distances

Dr. Zhu Youyu, the assistant bishop of the American Church, recently arrived in Shanghai from the southwest inland. The day before yesterday, at a luncheon hosted by the American United Universities Association at the American General Association, Dr. Zhu first spoke about his personal experiences traveling by road. Dr. Zhu compared Chinese roads with western American roads. He traveled at 90 kilometers per hour on Chinese roads. He witnessed that initially, the car drivers on the roads were unskilled in driving and experienced various unfortunate incidents. However, the Chinese authorities

Are Urgently Seeking Remedies

They established stations along the roads, allowing drivers to obtain good food and lodging, reducing unfortunate incidents and increasing work efficiency with remarkable results. These drivers came from various parts of the Far East, speaking English, Dutch, and Cantonese. Another important point, and perhaps the most important that can be reported, is that Dr. Zhu spoke about the situation of students in inland universities and middle schools. It is said that the morale in the inland is high, which can be seen in the students. Inland students live extremely hard lives, lacking instruments and food. A few students even lack shoes and socks, economizing on food and clothing, which is no different from beggars on the streets of Shanghai. Dr. Zhu also said that a group of female students, numbering four hundred, eagerly wished to participate in the

Madame Chiang Kai-Shek's

Training class, traveling for two months before arriving in Chongqing. When they arrived, a few of these female students had already broken their shoes and were barefoot. Each female student, after strict training, graduated from the program and was sent to the coastal areas to participate in various tasks. They greatly assist the military.

The Strictness of the Search is Rarely Seen

Unexpectedly, at 8 PM yesterday, a team of Japanese Naval Landing Force soldiers conducted a search in the alley at the intersection of Weituoma Road and Yangzhou Road. Suddenly, a Chinese man drew a gun and fired two shots at a Japanese soldier in the team, missing him. The remaining Japanese soldiers immediately returned fire, firing several shots, but the shooter escaped. The Japanese authorities tightened restrictions on vehicles and pedestrians in Hongkou, and implemented unprecedentedly thorough searches of Chinese residents, causing the situation in Hongkou to descend into chaos again. It is reported that, other than Pingliang Road, the intersection of Qiqihar Road, the area near Pingliang Road, Qiwupu Road, Yangzhou Road, and Huacheng Road, the remaining roads in the Hongkou district were only reopened to vehicles and pedestrians late last night. After the shooting on Weituoma Road last night, Japanese Naval Landing Force soldiers set up guard posts around the area and strictly searched pedestrians, buses, and rickshaw passengers, but did not find the shooter. Subsequently, one Chinese man and three women were arrested on suspicion. The searches yesterday afternoon and evening were not limited to Chinese residents; even foreigners and Japanese residents were searched. The Japanese authorities also dispatched numerous Naval Landing Force soldiers to search for armed suspects in Hongkou and Yangshupu.

Two Japanese Officers Were Severely Wounded

Furthermore, the Shanghai Times reported that the Japanese soldier Masakazu Takeda, who was shot and killed, and Corporal Ishii, who was wounded, both belonged to the medical team. One of the arrested assailants was also wounded by a bullet and sent to a nearby hospital, where he remained unconscious late into last night. As for the details of the sniper attack on a Japanese naval officer at the intersection of Weituoma Road and Yangzhou Road last night, details are unknown. It is rumored that the officer was suddenly shot twice by a Chinese man and was seriously wounded. The Japanese authorities refused to disclose the officer's name and whether he was injured yesterday, but it is widely believed that the officer has now been sent to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Huang Xiong was Shot in the Abdomen

Furthermore, at 8:30 PM yesterday, "City Police Bureau Official" Huang Xiong (transliteration) left his residence in Xiangshou Lane, Caojiadu. Suddenly, a Chinese man blocked his path, ordering him to stop. Huang Xiong thought he had encountered a robber, but the man unexpectedly pulled out a handgun and fired. Huang Xiong was shot in the abdomen and collapsed to the ground. The shooter escaped. Huang Xiong was rushed to the hospital, and his life is in danger. It is said that this case was politically motivated. Furthermore, the English Evening Star reported that the Japanese naval authorities here officially acknowledged the claim that a Japanese naval officer was sniped at on Weituoma Road last night. It is said that they have thoroughly investigated the reported location of the shooting on the road, but found no evidence to confirm the claim. One of the assailants who shot at the Japanese soldier on Pingliang Road yesterday afternoon and was arrested was interrogated by the Japanese military authorities today. Japanese Corporal Ishii, who was shot in the chest, is now being treated in a Japanese military hospital and is expected to fully recover. The remaining details are unknown.

### Xin Puyu Hall Eagerly Awaits Continued Donations from All Sectors

Recently, the Xin Puyu Hall has been facing imminent financial difficulties, appealing to all sectors and philanthropists for donations. Many have enthusiastically contributed, achieving good results. However, the goal is still far away. We earnestly request continued donations from all sectors. The donations received yesterday are listed as follows: Lizhi [school name] donated 58 yuan on behalf of the third-grade classmates, Yu Chenghao 50 yuan, Wang Shaner 50 yuan, Lizhiying [school name] donated 28 yuan and 10 cents on behalf of the first-grade classmates, Fang Zhengyi 10 yuan, Zheng Junyi 10 yuan, Pu Qiting 10 yuan, Xiangtai Timber Company Wang Lin 10 yuan, Tao Kaiquan 5 yuan, Liu Hong 4 yuan.

### Flour Sold at a Flat Price for One Day; Stockpiled Rice Shows Slight Market Response

Regarding the flat-price sale of flour, as a result of prior negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Fuxin and Fufeng factories, since January 3rd, Fuxin has supplied 9,873 bags per day, and Fufeng has supplied 1,059 bags (excluding Sundays), totaling 6,932 bags, priced at 23 yuan per bag at the factory, plus a handling fee of 3 jiao for the flour dealers. The above supply amount, for six days a week, totals 41,592 bags, only enough to meet the needs of users for five days (daily flour demand is 8,318 bags). Therefore, it is stipulated that users can only collect flour for five days a week. It has been learned that due to the suspension of work at the Fuxin factory, the supply of flour has been stopped since last Tuesday (February 18th). Therefore, the supply amount has become even more scarce. Hence, since the same day, the sale of flat-price flour has been temporarily suspended. On the other hand, the flour issued by the Fufeng factory every day has been gradually accumulated. It has now accumulated 8,318 bags, enough to meet the needs of users for one day. It is scheduled to be sold in full tomorrow (28th). Users can go to the original flour dealer to collect flour, which will still be sold for 23 yuan and 3 jiao per bag. It is also learned that yesterday (February 26th), 8,318 bags of imported flour were sold in one day. As of tomorrow, it is estimated that there will be a surplus of 13 bags of Fufeng Lao Chepai flour and 657 bags of imported flour. After accumulating a certain amount in the future, they will be distributed on a scheduled basis. On the other hand, the Bureau has negotiated with the Fuxin factory, requesting it to find ways to produce flour from the remaining raw materials as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs of the market.

The Rice Market Order Gradually Stabilizes; After the Bean, Rice, and Coarse Grain Industry Association took emergency measures, although the rice market situation has not seen extremely great development, it has improved slightly compared to a few days ago. The market has seen stockpiled goods responding to the market, and sales are all within the price limits set on the 3rd of this month. The market order has also gradually stabilized. However, large organizations generally find it difficult to change their ways, which is difficult to understand. The two associations also announced to the market yesterday that from March 1st, applications to join the rice market for business operations will be temporarily suspended. The Rice and Grain Brokers Association announced that the current rice price has reached the top of the limit. Under this situation, the only task of our association members is to advise each holder of goods to freely sell their stored rice within the price limit. Those who exceed the price limit and privately trade will be responsible for their own punishment. Our association will not protect them. The Food Cooperative Association stipulates the method for rickshaw pullers to collect tips for delivering rice: (1) For delivery downstairs at Xinlou, 1 jiao per bag will be given. (2) For delivery upstairs, 2 jiao per bag will be given.

### After the Dissolution of the Islamic Relief Association, There is No New Organization

Shanghai City's Muslim believers number over 100,000, with over a dozen mosques. After the outbreak of the war, zealous believers organized the Islamic Disaster Relief Association to relieve displaced believers. After the association officially announced its dissolution last year, there has been no organization of any kind. Currently, reports indicate that Li Wangshu and others are initiating the organization of a certain association. The reporter visited many Muslim friends, who all expressed their disapproval of the organization.

### A True Record of the European War

Since the publication of the "A True Record of the European War" issued by this newspaper, within less than a month, sales have been booming, a miracle unseen in this year's domestic publishing industry. And in recent days, those coming to the newspaper to wholesale and retail purchases are still streaming in. There are numerous letters from Yu, Rong, Gui, Zhu, Dian, and the Nanyang area requesting wholesale. The purpose of this newspaper's publication of this book is to instill international knowledge and increase the interest of our readers. It is not comparable to general booksellers who only seek profit. Therefore, although the entire book has as many as tens of thousands of words and over two hundred pages, the selling price is slightly over two yuan. Wholesale from other places cannot be refused, but current traffic is blocked, delivery is difficult, and the post office refuses to accept books. Therefore, those requesting wholesale from other places cannot be accommodated for the time being. If the Shen Zhuang of bookstores in other places can bear the responsibility of transportation themselves, then this newspaper will also be happy to offer preferential discounts to supply the book industry's wholesale purchases. As for local readers, if you want to buy more or retail, please do so as soon as possible, because there are not many books in stock now, and only a little over a thousand copies are available for retail, which will soon be sold out. Currently, the prices of paper and ink are skyrocketing. In the future, the selling price of the reprint will inevitably be forced to increase to reduce losses.

### The American General Association Convenes a Special Meeting to Discuss the Issue of Moving Out of the Old Clubhouse; Someone is Willing to Purchase, Name Unknown

Since the news of the Shanghai American General Association's auction of the clubhouse at 20 Yi Road, Fuzhou Road, was released, someone who did not want to announce their name has been willing to offer a price to purchase it. In order to consider this issue, the association has specifically scheduled a special meeting at 5:30 PM today. According to an employee of the association, it is impossible to find out who the willing buyer is. If the association really sells it, what plans will be made in the future can only be known after today's meeting. According to reliable sources, if the clubhouse on Fuzhou Road is purchased, the American General Association will definitely be able to obtain a new and suitable clubhouse.

### Changes in Rickshaw Puller Registration; More Than 10,000 People Unemployed

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, since starting to exchange new licenses for public rickshaw pullers last month, has reached the deadline yesterday. The rickshaw pullers have also complied with the regulations and exchanged their licenses, but have not yet met the quota of 28,481 people. This is because some rickshaw pullers have left Shanghai due to business or have changed to other industries, resulting in many vacancies. It is planned to start new rickshaw puller registration from the 10th of next month. The rickshaw industry association of the Special District said that the Municipal Council's restrictions on rickshaw puller license exchange this time are harsh, requiring 20 shifts per month (an increase of 5 shifts), and limiting the registration of 3 people per rickshaw (a decrease of 1 person), resulting in more than 10,000 rickshaw pullers becoming unemployed in the past because they did not pull enough 20 shifts. Rickshaw owners have suffered parking losses due to the reduction in the number of rickshaw pullers. They have requested the Municipal Council to be lenient, but have not been granted permission. They plan to plead with the authorities again to change the method.

A murder case occurred at Room 125 on the second floor of the Carlton Apartment at the corner of Kirk Road and Park Road in the Public Concession at around 7:00 AM yesterday. The victim was a servant named Wang Jinwan, who was stabbed in the head.

Died on the Spot

Room 125 on the second floor of the Carlton Apartment is rented by an Indian man named T. Ghatalta (24 years old).

He hired Wang Jinwan (also known as Hui Jun, 37 years old) from Tongzhou as a servant. At around 7:00 AM yesterday, two men resembling people of a certain country suddenly broke in,

Intending to Murder

Fortunately, the Indian man was sleeping in the inner room. Wang was sleeping on the floor in the outer room. Wang suddenly heard footsteps on the floor. He was sleepy, only wearing underwear, and got up to ask who was visiting. Unexpectedly, before he could finish speaking, he was suddenly stabbed in the head with a sharp blade by the thugs, and a hole was pierced in his right forehead. His skull burst, and he died on the spot. The corpse was lying across the floor, a tragic sight.

A Reporter from the Pingming News Agency

Rushed to Investigate

At the time, according to the elevator driver and other servants of the apartment, no one was seen entering or leaving when the incident occurred. The above information is only one-sided information from the Indian man. There is no evidence to prove whether someone from a certain country broke in and committed the crime. Whether the Indian man is the murderer, who jumped off the building out of fear of punishment after the crime, using this as a smokescreen, or whether there are other reasons, the Indian man has been taken to the police station for strict interrogation. It is said that the case will soon be brought to light.

### Grain: Rice Market Fee Recovered; Large Stockpiles of Rice Still Not Sampled

Imported rice has a clear and flat market, but it is tight in the dark, and it has not officially entered the track. However, the general public believes that the international situation has eased and orders are always smooth. Therefore, the panic situation a few days ago has gradually become peaceful. Brokers have said that they will enter the market today or tomorrow. All kinds of imported rice have not been sampled, and what is on the market are still ordinary, low-grade, and miscellaneous goods, just for entertainment. Although there is no violation of the law in the market, the practice of paying fees outside the market can be seen everywhere. It is said that there is a case of paying 350 yuan to 400 yuan for every 100 bags of small-sized current rice. Although this statement has not been verified, judging from the fact that low-grade rice on the market is sold at the limited price, it is indeed possible to pay a high price for high-grade rice. New transactions are in negotiation. There were several batches, and the one that will be approved is 2,000 tons of pure rice in March at 80 yuan. Goods that have been recalled are no longer as persistent as they were a few days ago. Yesterday, No. 1 Saigon opened at 99 yuan in February, and small-sized goods opened at 90 yuan and 1.5 fen to 89 yuan and 5 fen in February and March, 91 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen to 92 yuan in February, and 80 yuan for broken rice, totaling seven or eight hundred tons. The transaction volume of current rice in the city is only 600 bags of No. 1 Siam. However, the original English Hua Heyi reported that small-sized goods for March futures opened at 91 yuan and 5 fen and 91 yuan, Jianwu reported 90 yuan and 89 yuan and 5 fen, and Yulong opened the call for the June Mintang, which was calculated at 86 yuan per dan.

Due to the scarcity of sources and the holding of foreign rice, domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice has continued to rise by 1 yuan in price under the sales of various parties. Kaikunshan Hu saw white japonica rice for 108 yuan and 5 fen, then to 106 yuan, and Qingjiao Hu saw thin rice for 104 yuan and 5 fen, 104 yuan, then to 103 yuan. The original package is short of goods and there is no market.

Glutinous rice has been booming due to repeated soaring prices, and its demand has turned lazy. At the same time, because it is not restricted, dealers have taken the opportunity to pour out, so when foreign tips are nowhere to be found, they see glutinous rice crowded, with supply exceeding demand, and they also depreciate Yuan Yuan. Hong Kong's special yuan opened at 89 yuan and Zhongguan at 87 yuan.

Imported rice arrived again yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou ship arrived at the port yesterday morning and loaded 2,500 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the Bund of the French Concession. (Zhu)

### Factory Flour Sold at Flat Price for Two Days

Flour: Yesterday, imported flour had already softened because the Chinese flour factory had temporarily resumed supplying the flat price for two days on this street, so the demand for imported flour has suddenly decreased, and more than 100,000 bags of land cargo will arrive in the near future. People's hearts are slightly discouraged. Transactions were held in the morning, and the price of Zhonglou brand Australian flour was called at 26 yuan and 2 jiao, but there was no suitable owner. The market was slightly open, and the price was relaxed to 26 yuan again. Blue Mark Flower and Golden Dragon brand were also loosened by 2 jiao and 3 jiao each. The transaction of existing flour in the city is less than 10,000 bags.

Wheat: The darkness is as tight as before because the supply of domestic and foreign sources is exhausted. Occasionally, there is sporadic existing cargo, and the sellers live in a strange place and do not get out. The asking price has reached 41 yuan, but the factory's limited price is 40 yuan, and the Japanese factory's limited price is 37 yuan. Only a few are embellishments.

### Finance - Foreign Exchange Calm

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices, remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American currencies hovered steadily. Most operators are awaiting developments in the situation. However, negative rumors continued to spread. Speculators, amidst the softness, suddenly sold off, so the trend turned flat. In the morning session, the transaction price for the current month's US dollar reached $5.5625 from $5.53125, and by noon, the situation was very stagnant. As a result, both British and American currencies remained flat. The spot price for the US dollar was $5.5625, and the British pound was three shillings, four pence, two and one-eighth of a penny. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

After the opening, Hong Kong Electric had a considerable need, settling the US dollar for February at $5.53125 with the Bank of China. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was also flat. After this, negative news spread frequently, and some speculators came to sell, so the potential became firmer. The February US dollar returned to $5.5625, and the March US dollar at $5.53125 also saw many transactions. By noon, the market felt extremely stable.

### Futures Slightly Recovered, Cash Plunged, More Than One Hundred Yuan

Yesterday's cash, in the unofficial market, could be described as quite stable. Although foreign exchange was stable, and there were many negative rumors, people were not moved. One reason was that the price had been pushed down too quickly in the afternoon of the previous day, resulting in a lack of buyers at the opening. Once, under the buying of De Fu, Da Feng, Ren Cheng, Yong, and others, it rose to $6,305. Later, due to the spread of negative news from the exchange market, remittance firms such as Heng Ji, Xin Feng, and Yong sold off, pushing it down to $6,225. After that, He Sheng, Cheng Ji, and others maintained the price, and it closed at $6,253, up $33 from the previous day. The half-day transaction volume was 15,600 taels. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Outside the market, it was once speculated to $6,310, but it was difficult to maintain for long, and the last transaction was at $6,270. The swap (February to March) selling price was around $40. Cash suddenly fell by more than $100. Yi Yuan sold 500 taels to Xiang He, and the forward price was also $440 higher. Later, the chips were abundant, and it was reduced to $410. Finally, there were no buyers at $400, causing jewelry gold to be listed at a small $10 down to $680. Customs gold and others remained flat.

Thirteen Hundred Yuan Entered and Exited Again

In the early morning, due to the sharp decline in the evening of the previous day, there were many buyers at the opening, so the price was raised, $30 higher than the previous day, to $6,250. After the opening, the trend was even better. De Fu, Da Feng, Ren Cheng, Yong, He Sheng, and others bought strongly, and it gradually rose, finally breaking through $6,300, reaching $6,305. At that time, foreign exchange was also slightly tight. However, Heng Ji, Xin Feng, and Yong saw the high price and threw it out. Furthermore, because the foreign exchange turned flat, all other parties stopped, and it fell, reaching $6,225. After a long period of hovering, Cheng Ji and He Sheng had considerable buying, and it was pulled to $6,260. As a result, it still closed at $6,253, $33 higher than the previous day. After the close, it was heard that the outside market was doing business at $6,265. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The outside market price once rose to $6,310, and there were transactions. Soon it retreated, and finally there were no buyers at $6,270. The gold shop's own brand gold also saw a decline, and the forward delivery price was $400 higher. The closing purchase was $70-80 lower than the sale. The current bid gold still had no price and no market.

Jewelry Gold Listed Ten Yuan Lower

The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael was initially unchanged. At noon, it was $10 lower. Da Tong Hang changed to list $680, and Xin Tong Hang was similar to the previous price. Purchases were reduced by $30, it was said.

### Foreign Currency Slightly Fluctuating

Yesterday's foreign currency market was tense with volatile prices. British and American gold pounds each rose by one yuan. British gold notes remained stable. The market price remained flat. American gold notes once rose to $17.85 in the afternoon, but finally settled at $17.75, up one jiao and three fen from the previous day. Hong Kong notes showed a slightly upward trend. Japanese gold notes rebounded slightly, with the evening market at $1.76. Korean notes were still in high demand, with the evening market rising to $1.41.

### Securities - Government Bonds Strong, Foreign Stocks Trended Soft

The unofficial market for government bonds continued to rise strongly yesterday. Xin Fu continued to buy, showing no signs of waning. It has been absorbing in the market for days, and its strength can be imagined. Therefore, the chips in the market are becoming increasingly exhausted. If positive news comes, a short squeeze is inevitable, because the transactions of fellow traders are mostly in and out from time to time, constantly circulating in the market, while they only buy in and do not sell out, which is a tactic of draining the pond to catch all the fish. Yesterday morning, Xin Fu took the lead in buying, opening the price for Class C at $65.20. At the same time, because Hong Da, Tong Shun, and Xin Hua also bought, the price rose straight to a high of $6.05 at the close. At that time, Tong Kang, Heng Kang, and Yi Tai sold more, but it still felt like a drop in the bucket, to no avail. At the noon close, various bonds rose by eight jiao to one yuan and three jiao. In the afternoon, the fluctuations were relatively small, with ups and downs, but the footing was still very strong. It can be seen that the bulls have a clear organization, and the future is difficult to predict. As a result, the market price all rebounded by eight jiao to one yuan and one jiao. The transaction volume was one million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Trading: Fifty shares of Dasheng No. 1 Factory were traded at a price of $19.00.

The public stock market was extremely quiet, with nothing to offer. Although sellers were not eager to sell, the trend seemed slightly soft. Transactions in both industrial and rubber stocks were rare.

London, 25th (Tuesday) report: Today, the listing prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British companies' stocks were mostly flat. British stocks fluctuated. Shanghai Tramway fell two shillings and six pence to twelve shillings and six pence. Shanghai Waterworks A shares fell one and a half pounds to twelve pounds. Bao An Insurance shares rose four pounds to twenty-four pounds. Gula Kelin Rubber shares rose one and a half pence to fifteen shillings and nine pence. The rest were unchanged.

— Feng Liutang

Clepsydra Leaks (Continued)

The system of clepsydras includes copper pots, water balances, thirsty birds, leaking arrows, time tablets, and notches. The copper pot is for storing water, the bird is for drawing water, the balance is for leveling the leak, the arrow is for identifying the time, the tablet is made of ivory, the carved characters are filled with gold, from Mao to You, there are seven tablets to announce the time to the . There are two notches, made of wood, one is called "Release Drum" and the other is called "Stop Drum", used for the night. In the old days, the palace gates were opened one quarter after Mao Zheng (6:00 AM), and eight quarters were Chen Shi (8:00 AM). Every hour was like this until You Shi (6:00 PM). Every time an hour arrived, the official on duty presented the tablet and announced the correct time. The rooster-man led the singing and struck the drum fifteen times, and at noon Zheng (12:00 PM), the drum was struck one hundred and fifty times. At dusk, when the rooster crowed, the Release Drum notch was released, and the drum and bell were struck one hundred times, and then the clepsydra was started. Each night was divided into five watches, and each watch was divided into five points. The watch was marked by striking the drum, and the point was marked by striking the bell. The number of watches and points was recorded with chips, hence the name "watch chips". At the beginning of each watch, the rooster crowed, and when the point changed, the water balance was moved, until the second point of the fifth watch, the Stop Drum notch was released. In the fifth watch, the bell was struck one hundred times, and the rooster crowed and the drum was struck, which was called "assembling the points". After eight quarters, it was Mao Shi Zheng (6:00 AM). The time was announced in this cycle, and the four seasons were the same. However, in winter, the water was easy to freeze, and the dripping was ineffective. Sometimes fire was used to help, and Zhang Sixun made a clepsydra in his armillary sphere, and mercury was used instead of water in winter.

However, most people do not have clepsydra equipment, and only rely on experience. During the day, they look at the movement of the sun's shadow, and at night, they only rely on the report of the watchman, which is not accurate enough to mark the time. Therefore, most people know that the sky is about to dawn when they hear the rooster crow, and they know that dusk is approaching when they see the sun set. Ordinary people who want to know the time can distinguish it during the day when there is sunlight, and they use experience to infer the time on rainy days. The reason why Chinese people cannot keep time accurately is that the method of telling time has not been precise in the past. Furthermore, their working hours are too scattered, as the saying goes, "Work at sunrise, rest at sunset, what does the emperor's power have to do with me!" As a result, they do not value time. Although there is a saying that cherishes every minute and every inch of time, they only seek to move, not to keep. What's more, when talking about time on weekdays, they only say "It's almost noon," "It's time for breakfast," "It's almost dusk," "It's not time for a meal," "It's half a cup of tea's worth of work," "It's a pipe's worth of work," and so on. Their concept of time is too loose, so being early or late is not surprising. Now that clocks and watches are popular, and the time is gradually becoming more accurate, and most jobs have fixed times, the habit of keeping time in China will gradually develop in the future.

Because the method of telling time in ancient times was so negligent, it was difficult to know what time it was. Therefore, there is a mnemonic for fixing Yin Shi (3:00-5:00 AM), so that once Yin Shi is fixed, other times can be calculated. In fact, the time problem, if there is no other reliable method of timing, still cannot be used to solve it. Therefore, I will record its saying to show the difficulty of distinguishing time in ancient times.

"Zheng Jiu Wu Geng San Dian Che, Er Ba Wu Geng Si Dian Qiao, San Qi Ping Ming Shi Yin Shi, Si Liu Ri Chu Yin Wu Bie, Wu Yue Ri Gao San Di, Zhong Dong Cai Dao Si Geng Chu, Shi Yue Shi Er Si Geng Er, Bian Shi Yin Shi Jun Ji Qie."

Zheng Jiu means Zheng (January) and Jiu (September), which means that the Yin Shi of Zheng and Jiu months are both Wu Geng (4th watch) and three points. In the three and seven months, Ping Ming (dawn) is Yin Shi. The rest can be inferred in this way. However, this is just a saying for reference, and it is no longer needed now. (End)

### Yarn - Yarn Mills Reduce Labor to Save Electricity, Speculation Rises at Closing

The yarn market continued to rise, and the price increase was particularly sharp. This was due to good sentiment. According to rumors in the market, yarn mills may reduce labor to save electricity. If true, textile production would decrease, which would invisibly raise prices, thus triggering speculative buying. The market was driven by this, and it gradually moved forward. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse was $1,364, and the lowest price was $1,321. In the afternoon, the rising momentum became more intense, reaching $1,392. The price hovered between $1,384 for a long time, with very active trading. The price rose to $1,401, then retreated slightly to $1,393. The final price closed at $1,400. On the 27th, 80 bales of yarn were shipped to Little Luzon.

The opening situation for Double Horse was moderate in the morning. The opening price was $1,330, rising slightly to $1,335. At this time, the bulls sold off slightly, falling to $1,321. Then, hearing that the remaining price was rising, the buying interest was strong, and it rose again to $1,354. An atmosphere unfavorable to the bulls suddenly arose in the market, and it suddenly fell to $1,331, fluctuating for a long time between $1,338 and $1,339. When the market closed, the buying interest suddenly increased, saying that yarn mills would reduce labor, and it suddenly rose to $1,364 at the close. According to the statistics of transactions in the half-day, 7,850 bales were traded. The amount bought by each party is listed as follows:

The spot cotton situation is slightly rising, but not as sharp as the yarn market. This is because if yarn mills reduce labor, the demand for raw materials will be less. However, the sentiment is still good.

The New York cotton market was quiet and erratic, and short covering and the strength of Wall Street suddenly drove the rise. As a result, the closing price was up two to nine pounds from the previous day. Indian cotton was very flat. Yesterday's forecast showed no gains or losses.

The Shanghai outer cotton trading market seemed to be in a state of silence again. Yesterday, due to various factors such as the power company's reduction of power and the yarn mill's reduction of labor, although spot yarn repeatedly rose sharply, the trading of raw cotton was rarely asked about.

### Piece Goods - Factory Prices Increased, Dealers Hoarded

The factory cloth market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon, and the trend was firm. This was because factory prices gradually increased and dealers' interest in trading increased. The factory quoted a price of $42 for Dang Gui Fine Cloth, and $37 for Fugui Twill, with a total of more than 300 pieces. Because the quantity was too small, dealers hoarded. In the afternoon market, Fine Cloth was sold at $43.20, and Twill at $37.50. Various cloth prices in the morning market were flat. In the afternoon, Fine Cloth rose by five jiao to seven jiao and a half per piece, and Coarse Cloth, Twill, and Bleached Cloth rose by five jiao. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in the street. The Zhejiang-Ningbo group handled colored cloth and bleached cloth. More than 100 pieces of Fine Cloth. The Fujian-Guangdong group handled one hundred and several dozens of pieces of bleached and dyed cloths. On the 27th, one hundred pieces of piece goods were shipped to Singapore and one hundred and twenty-five pieces were shipped to Little Luzon.

Dongbu Cloth was weak first and then firm. As a result, the price of Fine Cloth continued to rise by five or six jiao per piece. Twelve-pound Dragon Head opened at $46.12 in the morning, once falling to $45.10. In the afternoon market, due to the rising price of yarn, the market sentiment was firm, and buyers flocked in, raising the price to $47.55. Beji remained at $13.10.

Harris Sells Well

Harris tweed has been selling quite well in the market recently. Large and small clothing companies have considerable buying. Because spring coats are still popular materials, both men's and women's colored clothing are very popular. Both British products and local factory goods are selling well. Yesterday, British-made single-width genuine Harris tweed sold for about $40 per yard, and ordinary double-width tweed sold for $335. Renli Tianma map sold for $18, and Meilun Santa Claus sold for $12.

### Oil Cake - Soybean Cake Market Both Tired

Yesterday, both oil cake and soybeans were weak. Although various Southern Ocean groups inquired about soybeans, they still showed little strength under the heavy storage. Although the oil cake futures trading will be banned, the scope of spot transactions is small, and it is not as profitable as speculative trading, which is large and fast, so secret transactions are still difficult to stop. However, there was no shortage of settlement procedures on the market yesterday. Hankou oil was shipped to correct the situation, or it may be hit. Peanut oil was also flat. The future of bean cake is related to the intermittent route to the Southern Ocean, so it is temporarily brewing and still difficult to clarify. The transaction market prices of various types are detailed in the market price column.

On the 27th, beans were exported, 2,910 bags were shipped to Singapore, and 335 bags were shipped to Little Luzon.

### Sugar Market - Sugar Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to fall. The association divided, spot two or four coarse white foreign stack was initially good at $80, but then returned to $79.80. Dutch red was $60.84. Taikoo Car White B Mark West Stack was $79 to $79.10, East Stack was $78.50. DY Mark West Stack was $78.20, HX Mark was initially $77.50, and then loosened to $77, $76.80, and $76.50. The three-month coarse white futures were $80 on the 10th, and $80.50 to $80.02 on the 20th. Also, 300 bags of sugar were shipped from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Coal - Tong Deli Coal Price High, Wait and See

After a large batch of Tong Deli white coal was shipped in the previous week, the shops and households in this store have been busy with it for days. Yesterday, because most of the purchasing was sufficient, they were reluctant to buy at the high price and waited and see. Although the major dealer still maintained a high price of $245, the old order unofficial market was called $210, and there was also selling off to sell for cash. In the street competition, the screened lump was $256 per ton, including delivery.

### Dried and Fresh Goods - Qicai Steps Up

Due to the shortage of Qicai recently, it has been re-displayed. Yesterday's market price for Chongshi hairy vegetables was $74 to $72, Xilan vegetables were $70 to $68, Longya vegetables were $65 to $60, and Wudun vegetables were $60. The market situation is still strong.

### Silk and Tea - Red and Green Tea Sources Surge

In recent days, the sources of red and green tea in Zhejiang Province have gradually become abundant. The Zhejiang authorities have recently lifted the ban on tea leaves that do not meet the purchase requirements. According to tea merchants, the red and green tea recently shipped from Wenzhou, Shipu, and other places is no less than thousands of dan. However, the water foot is extremely expensive, each gongdan costs 220 yuan in legal tender, and the cost is extremely high. As for foreign sales, the German firm has slightly discussed the price of black tea. It is reported that 350 pieces of tea leaves were shipped to Singapore for export today.

### Ministry of Education - Actively Promotes Phonetic Symbols, Orders Provincial Education Bureaus to Handle Three Key Points

(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education regards the transmission and practice of phonetic symbols as the primary task for eradicating illiteracy. In view of the fact that the methods of transmission and practice in the past mostly emphasized unified language and were overly precise in terms of standard intonation, it is difficult to find teachers and the training takes time. The Ministry believes that the main purpose of transmission and practice is to assist literacy, so it is necessary to strive for practicality and simplicity in order to facilitate promotion. It has issued a circular extracting relevant phonetic symbol teaching materials and bibliographies over the years, and instructing educational bureaus in all provinces and cities to comply. The key points are as follows: (1) The pronunciation and spelling of phonetic symbols added next to Chinese characters should not be mistaken to the extent that they are incorrect. As for the tone marks in the upper right corner, the teaching can be based on the local natural tones of the Chinese characters, and it is not necessary to teach according to the national standard tones. (2) When necessary, the local pronunciation method, which is very different from the national pronunciation on the right side of the phonetic Chinese characters, can be spelled and added on the left side of the phonetic Chinese characters, and read out according to the pronunciation to facilitate teaching. (3) The preliminary teaching methods of phonetic symbols are also divided into three categories according to the level of the students: 1. Ordinary primary schools use the method of first synthesis and then analysis. 2. Mass literacy classes use the method of combining synthesis and analysis. 3. Teacher training uses the method of first analysis and then synthesis.

### Being Educated and Obeying Order

— Tianjing

We often hear gilded professors say that foreigners obey order, while our country is a mess. Why is there such a difference? It is said that it is because of the low level of education among the people.

In fact, being educated, even highly educated, does not necessarily mean obeying order. Because education seems to only concern "knowing," while obeying order is a matter of "doing." If one "knows" but does not "do," then education is still useless.

For example, there is a library in our school, but the noise inside is no less than that of a teahouse. One group of people is "chatting," another group is "talking about the world," and here are three or five young ladies having a casual conversation. (If anyone protests and says that I am slandering women, I would not dare, because in fact, most of those chatting around the stove are young ladies; this is really unfortunate. However, those eating peanuts in the library are mostly men.)

University students should know the rules of the library, right? However, not only is our school's library like this, but nine out of ten universities in Shanghai are like this. How do you explain this?

Some public libraries—where most of the readers are small clerks who have not even attended middle school—are very quiet. Doesn't this seem to indicate that being educated and obeying order are not related?

If being educated is always another matter that has nothing to do with one's conduct, then it doesn't matter whether one is educated or not; in fact, it is better not to be educated at all. And this so-called education should go to the grave to rest.

### Interesting Anecdotes About the Willkie Couple

— Zhi

Wendell Willkie, a former candidate for the Republican nomination for president of the United States, has recently been said to be coming to China for inspection, which has attracted the attention of all sectors of Chinese society. There are not many records of his deeds, so let me talk about anecdotes about him and his wife.

Although Willkie came from a business background, he had the skills of a politician, so he was supported by the general public. His enthusiasm for political life was so great that he forgot to eat and sleep. As usual, a politician's wife must also be like her husband, going everywhere to show off, like Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, whose name is almost above the president's. However, Mrs. Wendell Willkie is a typical virtuous wife and loving mother, and her personality is very different from her husband's.

Wendell is a typical American woman, young and lively, with a pair of brown eyes, slightly brown hair, elegant and generous demeanor, and a love of art, singing, and dancing. However, she does not like socializing, especially not liking to show her face in public, so everyone does not know her.

Last fall, when Willkie and Roosevelt were competing for president, everyone was giving speeches and attacking each other, and the American people were very interested in who would win. One day, a tailor was measuring Wendell for clothes, knowing that her last name was Willkie, but only thought she was an ordinary person, so he asked her, "Do you know this fellow Willkie?" If another woman who loves vanity heard this, wouldn't she roar and scold him for not knowing Mount Tai? However, she replied faintly, "Slightly, he is my husband." The tailor was shocked.

Mrs. Wendell does not lack for understanding of politics, and she often discusses political issues with her husband in private, but she is unwilling to give speeches in public. When people asked her why, she replied, "In any case, it is my husband who is the presidential candidate, not me." Therefore, when Willkie set off to make campaign speeches across the country, his wife "followed the imperial carriage," limiting herself to taking care of his diet and paying attention to his sleep, without helping publicly.

Once, when Willkie arrived somewhere, hundreds of people who admired him lined up to shake hands with him to pay their respects. At this time, a beautiful woman was also mixed in the crowd. When she shook hands with him, she said the same thing as others, "Ah, Mr. Willkie, I have heard of you for a long time." Willkie did not pay attention, and shook hands with her with a smile as usual, but when he looked closely, this person was none other than his own wife.

The American presidential election considers whether or not a candidate obtains the support of New York voters to be a critical factor in winning or losing. Once, Willkie gave an important speech in the courthouse of New York State, and the audience was packed. Wendell arrived late and could not enter. She could have announced her name and obtained an excellent seat, but she was unwilling to do so, preferring to return home and listen to her husband's speech on the radio.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(4) Unexpected Encounter

A rush of alcohol surged to Yu Kun's head, and he unknowingly forgot everything. He only managed to say, "You are being unreasonable!" before raising his hand and slapping Shen Mazi hard on the left cheek. Zhao Si panicked and immediately jumped up to try to stop him, but it was too late.

Shen Mazi, caught off guard, was not willing to let it go. He aimed at Yu Kun's right ear and delivered a punch. But no matter how fast he was, he could not match Yu Kun's speed. As soon as his attack was launched, the small and nimble figure had already darted out of the door.

"Damn you! Where are you going?" Shen Mazi widened his strange eyes covered with red veins, kicked away a stool in front of him, and chased out like a mad tiger.

Begonia knew Yu Kun's background. When it comes to fighting, he would not suffer a loss. She also wanted to take the opportunity to teach Shen Mazi a lesson, so she stood in the room and did not say a word.

"Ah! This is bad!" Zhao Si said, panting like a cow, "You should quickly persuade Boss Zhao! As the saying goes, a strong dragon cannot defeat a local snake. We can't come to Tianjin in the future?"

"When our second brother is drunk, he doesn't recognize anyone. You should go and persuade him!"

Just as Zhao Si ran out of the room, shouting all the way, "Let's talk it out, everyone, don't fight," a loud thud was heard, followed by Yu Kun's voice, shouting "Ouch!" Then the voices of the people below became a clamor.

Now Yu Kun's drunkenness had also been scared away! He really did not expect that Shen Mazi, who looked very strong, would be so useless. He only lightly tripped him, and he would fall straight down the handrail.

"Blood! Blood! Blood!" Several tea servers on night duty downstairs, and many guests who had not yet fallen asleep, immediately rushed out and surrounded Shen Mazi, who was fainting on the tile floor, shouting.

Begonia stood behind Zhao Yu Kun, looking down from the top of the handrail, which was more than thirty steps high. With the light of the electric lamp, she could clearly see that Shen Mazi, who had just spoken rudely, was lying on the ground like a dead dog, with fresh blood flowing from the back of his head. Just this one glance made him tremble all over like he was having a fever. (41)

Family

### Father Has a Concubine

— Cao

My father has a concubine. She is a woman who curses, not young, but not qualified to be my mother. After she came, the family became very chaotic, divided into two factions: me, my old grandmother, and my second brother on one side; she, my father, and a nanny on the other side; competing openly and secretly for benefits. Imagine, if a family has this kind of phenomenon, can it still be run well?

The sound of mahjong tiles clacking resonated in my father's room all day long, making people unable to have a moment of peace, let alone think about reading and writing.

My old grandmother is already over seventy years old, and her failing eyes still have to sew and mend clothes for us two brothers. Really, besides her, who else would care about our clothes? Originally, she should have been enjoying her old age, but now she is troubled, for the sake of her two grandsons.

My mother is too weak. After being abandoned by my father for so many years, she is still quietly living a life of suffering in the countryside with my younger brother and me.

Every night, I think of them, and I always silently wish them happiness and health, but tears soak through my pillow again.

New Movie Review

### "The Thief of Bagdad"

— Hu Fanfang

"The Thief of Bagdad" was originally a masterpiece by Douglas Fairbanks, but that was a silent film. Now, Alexander Korda has acquired the copyright of the old edition. After two years of production and an investment of two million US dollars, he has finally created this unparalleled mythological epic.

Everyone knows that the story of "The Thief of Bagdad" is taken from "One Thousand and One Nights," and many people must have read the story, so there seems to be no need to repeat it here. However, for the convenience of writing, it may be helpful to mention a few points. Originally, this was a dazzling and fantastical story that took place in the ancient city of Baghdad, writing about how the thief Abu helped the prince crush the conspiracy of a cunning prime minister who understood magic, and marry the princess with whom the prince fell in love at first sight. In this, there are magical deeds, beautiful scenery, enchanting fairylands, and thrilling demons. Flying carpets, flying horses, magic arrows, spider caves, demon-suppressing bottles, heavenly eye stones, and, as the advertisements say, summoning wind and rain, and moving mountains and seas, are truly magnificent and dazzling. If you use ordinary views to measure such a film, it would be comparing apples and oranges.

Because all the miracles in this are a hundred and eight thousand miles away from reality, what we should ask is not whether it is possible or not, but whether it looks real or not. So, are all the miracles in "The Thief of Bagdad" real or not? The author has one sentence to say: Since the advent of color films, the beauty of the colors and the grandeur of the set design in this film are worthy of special praise. The towering palace and the dazzling and magnificent sets inside make people feel like they are floating in the air, especially the princess's tour and the scenes of the princess talking to the prince by the pool, which are indescribably beautiful. As for the giant demon released from the demon-suppressing bottle, Abu stealing the heavenly eye stone, the demon performing magic, and moving mountains and seas, although they have exhausted the grand spectacle of mystery and the ability of magic, these are all camera tricks by the photographers. It is beautiful, good, and perfect, but it is not enough to add to it, because if the director is a little smarter about things like flying horses soaring into the sky, then what you see on the screen seems to be even more beautiful and real.

The actors in the entire film, because of the story's magical mystery and rich interest, are easy for everyone to perform well. The best performance should be attributed to Conrad Veidt, who plays the cunning prime minister. This gentleman is quite reputable in England. Chinese audiences may still remember him, because he once played "Rasputin." He portrays the cunning prime minister's demeanor very meticulously, making the audience hate and love him at the same time. Second only to him is Sabu, who plays the leading role. His Abu is the role that Douglas Fairbanks played back then. This thief from Baghdad is very quick-witted and intelligent. Sabu's performance is also just right. June Duprez's princess is extremely beautiful. John Justin's prince is also quite competent. In short, this is a 100% film for the eyes to enjoy ice cream.

Finally, please let the author add one more tail: the color sound film "The Thief of Bagdad" has no moon palace and does not sell boxes, because this story has already been adapted. Many plots are different from the silent film, and the section about the moon palace and selling boxes has been changed to Abu stealing the psychic heavenly eye stone on the top of the Buddha. As for why the film title "The Thief of Bagdad" is still used, it is probably for the sake of being known to both women and children!

### Rudolph Valentino's Thirteenth Anniversary of Death

— Kang Lin

Rudolph Valentino, the movie fans' lover of the silent era, is being remembered on the thirteenth anniversary of his death this year. Although he dominated the silent era, people can still remember him now, which shows how deep an impression he left on movie fans. The Valentino Commemoration Committee in Hollywood, initiated by the famous director Freney Blore, held a memorial service in a local chapel, praising Valentino's artistic achievements during his lifetime. Hundreds of movie fans participated.

### Shanghai Drama Society Takes Over the Xuan Palace Theater; Contract Signed and Transfer Fee Paid

— Hei Ding

This is a lightning-like change in the Shanghai theater scene in 1940! The Shanghai Drama Society has been cooperating with the Lafayette Theater for more than a year. Although there have been unfavorable times and locations, it has fought through them with the united efforts of all members of the Drama Society. The performance of "The Family" has undoubtedly left the most glorious page in the history of drama this year. More than sixty sold-out performances have not only given the Drama Society unlimited economic and material assistance, but also proved that their two or three years of hard work have laid a solid foundation for Shanghai drama. However, the relationship that "The Family" and Lafayette can maintain is only one month, because the contract between the Drama Society and Lafayette expires at the end of February. Therefore, the audience who pre-ordered tickets for this Sunday's performance at Lafayette were politely refused.

The question of whether the contract between the Drama Society and Lafayette would continue has been discussed a long time ago, but there has not been a definite decision. During this period, many other theaters contacted the Drama Society, but it was only in negotiations. However, it was not long ago that the Xuan Palace Theater sent a representative to contact the Shanghai Drama Society. The process was so smooth. Relying on a previous cooperative relationship, and with the sincere attitude of both parties, Xuan Palace was very willing to transfer the entire theater to the Drama Society. So, the contract for the transfer was quickly signed. From March, the ownership of Xuan Palace will belong to the Drama Society.

This is the first time that a theater has been owned by a drama troupe. The Drama Society plans to make major renovations to the interior of the theater to make it suitable for performing spoken dramas. In order to ensure future development, major adjustments will be made to the repertoire and lineup. The Drama Society in 1941 will meet the audience with a brand-new look.

### Chinese Film Studio Shoots "Funeral for Admiral Osugi"

Japanese Admiral Osugi and others recently flew to the vicinity of Hainan Island to observe, attempting to step up their southward advance. In the airspace of Zhongshan County, they were shot down by the troops of Commander Hua Yuan. Everyone in the plane, from Osugi downwards, died. The Chinese authorities, considering that Osugi and others were senior Japanese generals, specially telegraphed Yu Hanmou, ordering that Osugi and others be buried with honor at Kunlun Pass, to show the demeanor of a great power. It is learned that the China Film Studio, in order to make this fact known to the world, has telegraphed its cameraman Li Yin, who is stationed in Guilin (recently returned to Guilin after filming in Nanning), to immediately go to Kunlun Pass to film the process of the funeral for Admiral Osugi and transport the newsreel for screening at home and abroad.
