### Admiring the Great Aspiration of the Chinese People, the United States Decides to Provide Assistance: Roosevelt's Broadcast Address Announces to the World a Thorough Awakening to Confront the Threat with All Efforts

Washington – President Roosevelt, in a nationwide broadcast last night, stated that the United States has begun to channel material aid to Britain and other countries opposing the Axis powers. This aid will gradually increase until full victory is achieved. The President delivered this important speech at the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner, where he was invited as an honored guest. President Roosevelt specifically promised to aid Britain and Greece with ships, planes, food, tanks, medicines, and various supplies. He declared that the aspirations of the nation will not be destroyed by the threats of powerful foreign countries or by selfish groups and individuals abroad. Do not let dictators in Europe and Asia doubt our concerted efforts. He repeatedly and solemnly affirmed the need for swift action and urged the nation to work and sacrifice for the country and its freedom, setting aside personal differences until victory is achieved. President Roosevelt also said that our democratic system has taken practical action. The autocracy of old Prussia was inferior in its wickedness, and the current National Socialism is even worse. They openly seek the elimination of government by elections on every continent. These people and their hypnotized followers call it the "New Order." This is neither "new" nor "orderly." The United States has come to a clear and democratic decision in a slow manner. By now, the world no longer doubts America's attitude.

Ending Appeasement Attempts and Starting Practical Action

This decision will bring an end to our appeasement attempts and any compromise with violent rule and oppression. We firmly believe that when our production rate reaches its peak, the democratic nations of the world will prove that the dictatorial system cannot win. We will send every surplus plane and other military equipment, whether new or used, to aid democratic countries. This is the sum of our strength. The important news of this week is as follows: We have announced to the world that we, as a united nation, deeply understand the danger we are facing. To cope with it, our democratic system has taken practical action. The dictators' plan to annex European countries, from 1939 to 1940, was implemented according to the original plan, until it was defeated by the indestructible defense of Britain. The enemies of democratic countries have made a fatal mistake, they mistakenly believed that democratic countries could not withstand such a terrible world war. The President continued, dictators believe that conquering our country is merely an internal problem that can be achieved by plunging our country into chaos and spiritual decline. The United States will not be swayed by appeasers, defeatists, or the mentally deranged. The American people have finally reached a decision that is respected by the public. Our unity must be understood by free men and women, and it can only be effective when realized with wisdom and courage.

In an Era of Restoration, America Should Continue to Fulfill Its Responsibilities

The President also said that the degree of final sacrifice for every American depends on the speed of our actions now. However, our nation's current call for sacrifice is a matter of right, not a matter of law. He said that until the work is completed, the people must temporarily forget the idea of business as usual. He also said that if we want to win, we must go all out. He solemnly stated the difference between loyalty and obedience, and said that America's determination must not be hindered by speculation, unnecessary strikes, shortsighted handling, or any destructive actions. If we do not win, then all freedoms in management and labor will be out of the question. The President said that the morale of the British people is now stronger than ever, and they are ready to strike back against aggression anywhere. Britain's current motto is that ordinary people with clear minds are willing to die as free men rather than live as slaves. President Roosevelt continued to talk about the China issue, saying that China has similarly revealed the great aspiration of hundreds of millions of people to resist aggression. China, represented by Chairman Chiang, has requested our assistance. The United States has told them that China will receive our assistance. Our country will implement our people's motto, making our country the arsenal of democracy. Finally, he said that when the dictatorial system collapses, our country should continue our great responsibility in the era of world restoration. (United Press report from the 16th)

Washington – President Roosevelt, at the annual meeting of the Associated Press held at the White House last night, delivered a solemn speech broadcast to the world, stating that the United States has now thoroughly awakened and is fully prepared to deal with the crisis threatening all democratic countries, including the Americas. Everything he said was for the record, word for word. The President then spoke of aid to China, saying that China is the same as Britain, Greece, and other democratic countries fighting today. He expressed admiration for the noble aspirations of hundreds of millions of Chinese people to resist those who would dismember their country. China, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, has sought help from the United States, and we have told them that China will certainly receive our assistance. (Reuters report from the 16th)

Washington – People here all believe that President Roosevelt's broadcast speech promising full aid to Britain is the strongest statement he has ever made on international affairs. Several months ago, thousands of people expressed the opinion that America's aid to Britain was tantamount to entering the war. Since the passage of the Lend-Lease Act, this sentiment has become even more pronounced. President Roosevelt's words promising to do everything possible to crush totalitarianism have won the unanimous approval of the general public. Every word President Roosevelt said about dictators evoked cheers from the audience. Many prominent figures, such as British Ambassador Lord Halifax and Wendell Willkie, were in attendance. (Reuters report from the 16th)

Ottawa – After listening to President Roosevelt's speech, Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King will make a statement in the Canadian Parliament on Monday. Opposition leader R.B. Bennett told reporters that he was quite shocked by this important speech, because it was not only an appeal to the United States but also to the whole world. Everyone believes that President Roosevelt's repeated use of the terms "we" and "ours" in relation to the war means that the United States has joined the war without formally declaring it.

London – President Roosevelt's representative, Averell Harriman, arrived at an airfield near London yesterday afternoon via Lisbon. His mission here is to adjust the method of American aid to Britain. Because he wanted to meet with U.S. President's special envoy Donovan, who was returning to the U.S. from Britain, he delayed his arrival in Britain from Lisbon. After arriving here, Harriman told people, "Believe me, the American people truly want to get things done." (Reuters report from the 16th)

### Japanese Travel Agency Changes Style, Invites Germans and Italians to Visit Japan

Tokyo – The Japan Travel Bureau announced that Japan's business of attracting British and American people to travel to Japan will be stopped.

Editorial

### The Metamorphosis of Japan's "Imperial Rule Assistance Movement"

Realizing political reform was one of the major aspirations of the Konoe Cabinet when it was formed. Furthermore, they believed that this, along with ending the "China Incident" and adjusting relations with the Soviet Union, were prerequisites for advancing southward. Now, with the turmoil in Europe, Japan's southward advance is poised to happen. However, the problems with China and the Soviet Union, which they are trying to solve urgently, have extremely dim prospects. Yet the Japanese authorities have not easily relinquished their one-sided fantasies, as can be clearly seen from Matsuoka's recent trip to Europe and the change of commanders of the Japanese army in China, which reflect their aspirations. As for the internal political reform movement in Japan, it did indeed cause a stir at first. Japanese commentators praised it highly, even comparing it to the Meiji Restoration. But as time went by, things steadily deteriorated. Recently, it has reached a point of no return, and it would not be an exaggeration to say that it has been a complete failure. This kind of failure was not anticipated by the world when Konoe came to power again last summer. Now that Matsuoka has just embarked on his long journey, regardless of how successful this trip may be, it is conceivable that it will have a considerable impact on the development of international relations. On the eve of a possible international turning point, let us examine the internal situation in Japan.

Konoe's movement originated as far back as the Ogikubo Conference in the winter of 1936. Until the summer and autumn of last year, on the one hand, in order to salvage the political predicament in Japan caused by the protracted and unresolved war of aggression against China, and on the other hand, in order to build a high level of national defense to meet its southward requirements, "forming national unity" and "establishing a strong government" became its most realistic demands. Konoe himself made a comeback amid this call. When he announced the basic national policy on August 1 last year and spoke eloquently about reforming the domestic system, how could he not have looked down on the world with disdain and aspired to "develop a national defense system that mobilizes the overall strength of the country"? But in half a year, the situation has completely changed. The current Japanese Diet is known as the Support-the-State Diet, which shows that it has actually been placed under the control of the so-called Imperial Rule Assistance Movement. In addition, the political parties have all been dissolved, and the parliament is nothing more than a sacrificial lamb. However, its attacks on the Imperial Rule Assistance Movement have been carried out with ease. The questions about the political nature and budget of the association have made the authorities extremely embarrassed. Finally, Konoe and Hiranuma were successively responsible for replying, affirming that the association was a public organization rather than a political group, and that it had no policies of its own except to assist the government, and guaranteeing to reform the organization and content of the association, to refresh personnel, and to reduce the powers of the Imperial Rule Assistance Movement to the smallest possible extent. Compared with Konoe's initial claims of "establishing a new national organization," "mobilizing the overall strength of the country," and "seeking the comprehensive and unified strength of the nation," one cannot help but feel a sense of the past and the present. At the same time, so-called reformist politicians such as Nakano Seigo were extremely dissatisfied with these statements. He not only wrote articles criticizing the stripping of the political nature of the Assistance Association, making it merely a government auxiliary organ, but also resigned from his position as director of the Assistance Association and announced the revival of the Toho Association. Regardless of how this kind of turmoil develops in the future, the movement that Konoe used to appeal to has inevitably entered a tragic end.

The fact of this failure was clearly declared to the outside world through the current Japanese Diet, but this does not show the power of the Diet, but rather that the movement itself had too many weaknesses, so that even such a weak Diet could attack it until it was completely defeated. Tracing back to the beginning of the Ogikubo Conference, this movement originally appeared in the form of organizing a new party. This was still the case until Konoe resigned from the position of President of the Privy Council last summer. In early July, it began to reject the name of the new party, saying that it violated "great power," and changed to the name of a new political system. At that time, it had already disappointed the enthusiastic reformist politicians. The general public only felt that Konoe's statements were vague and empty, difficult to understand, and therefore sharply reduced the original evaluation. By the time the declaration of the new system was issued and renamed the Imperial Rule Assistance Movement, although it had already become an organ assisting the government, it was still "non-political but highly political." Then, it recruited figures from all sides into the association, hoping to achieve the effect of national unity, but the result was still that each went its own way, planting deep cracks and contradictions in the Assistance Association. In the meantime, the military publicly stated that active-duty soldiers could not participate. On the other hand, the brewing of the so-called "economic new system plan" again aroused strong resentment from the financial cliques and industrialists. In addition, the extremists criticized the status quo maintainers for holding key positions in the association, while the moderates disliked the reformist color of the association! The effect of "national unity" was not seen, but rather a new source of disputes was opened. The so-called Assistance Movement had actually lost its original political function, but the existence of organizations such as the Planning Bureau, which had been passed down from the initial historical transitions, indicated the political nature of the association. Moreover, although Konoe had painstakingly tried to achieve harmony between the Japanese Constitution and this movement, he was still unable to obtain a seamless explanation. In order to cope with the current Diet, he had already incorporated all the members into the Diet Bureau of the Support Association, and in advance strengthened the cabinet lineup, pulling in Hiranuma to jointly bear the responsibility. After the Diet opened, Machida first proposed that no questions be asked about the cabinet speech, and the government also sacrificed the submission of proposals such as changing the Diet election law in order to win the favor of the members. As a result, although the next year's budget and the General Mobilization Law Amendment were passed unconditionally, the issue of the performance of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association ultimately formed the biggest difficulty for the Hinai Cabinet. Although Konoe, after a cabinet consultation, made a clear statement in a general reply that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association was non-political and guaranteed the modification of the association's organization and activities, he still failed to satisfy the members, and even after Konoe claimed illness and avoided it, they continued to question Hiranuma relentlessly. Now that the Japanese Diet has reopened, it will soon be adjourned. Although this dispute has not been resolved, it can probably be brought to a conclusion in fact! And the new party movement and the new system movement, which were sensational before, have ultimately only developed into such a predicament. Konoe himself cannot but bear the responsibility for insufficient understanding and lack of courage for this failure. At the same time, it is also due to the current situation of the Japanese state. Even if some reformist politicians are very envious of the achievements of Germany and Italy in the past, the realistic conditions make it impossible for Japan to take the successful road that Germany and Italy have taken in the past.

Konoe's aspiration has failed, but Japan will not stop its attempt to advance southward because of this. Moreover, the worse the situation and the more internal difficulties, the more urgent the desire to take a chance and succeed. This is a fate prescribed by history, and no one can rectify it.

### British Troops Gather on the Nile to Prepare for Battle with German Forces; Over 100,000 British Troops Land in the West; Yugoslavia Resolves to Maintain Strict Neutrality

Cairo – Sources claim that the British Empire's overseas forces on the Nile have now been strengthened to an unparalleled level, ready to contend with Hitler on any battlefield. General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in North Africa, is now able to set aside time and strength to prepare for the next major offensive. It appears that British troops on the Nile are prepared to engage the Germans on the Greek front or to attack the Italian-held Dodecanese Islands. This implicitly confirms reports from the Associated Press last week that British expeditionary forces had landed in Greece. A private report this Friday stated that between 150,000 and 200,000 British troops have landed in the Greek region near Turkey. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

Istanbul – British sources acknowledged yesterday that a portion of British troops has landed in Greece, likely north of Domokos, to defend the Katakalo Pass. In the event of necessity, they will retreat to Salonika. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

New York – A dispatch from Budapest reports that, according to diplomatic sources, an estimated 150,000 British expeditionary troops have landed in Greece. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Yugoslav Capital – Reliable sources in diplomatic circles here reported yesterday that additional British troops have landed in Greece over the past several days, with a majority being motorized units. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Berlin – This afternoon's German military report stated that German troops continued to advance into Bulgaria yesterday. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)

London – Last night, Yugoslavia broadcast a statement of official intent in English by Premier Simović, demonstrating Yugoslavia's determination to maintain national independence and consistently uphold its status as a non-belligerent. The statement was entitled "Freedom, Independence, and Peace," and stated briefly that "We cannot sacrifice our freedom and independence for the benefit of others. We will consistently defend what is ours. Even amidst today's widespread war, we will remain a non-belligerent. However, this non-belligerent must be armed to defend against attack." (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Yugoslav Capital – Germany has waged a psychological war against Yugoslavia for months, but Yugoslavia remains unwilling to sign the Tripartite Pact, desiring only to maintain its strictest neutrality. All rumors regarding the resignation of Eden or Yugoslavia's capitulation can be dismissed as unfounded. At most, Yugoslavia's concession to Germany would be to sign a non-aggression pact, clearly stating that it will resist attacks from any side. After rejecting Hitler's specific proposals for a new European order in Berchtesgaden in February, Yugoslavia proposed a non-aggression pact. If Germany is not prepared to accept this, then there is no reason for the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to meet with Hitler in Germany again. The Yugoslav people naturally express their views with more freedom than the government. The attitude of the people seems somewhat impatient, but the government's policy prioritizes national interests and does not conflict with public opinion. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Yugoslav Capital – Sources claim that Yugoslavia has reached an agreement in principle with Germany whereby Yugoslavia does not need to join the Axis Pact. Yugoslavia feels its negotiating position has been significantly strengthened since taking national defense measures. The Soviet ambassador to Yugoslavia suddenly returned to his post yesterday after a two-month absence, which is related to diplomatic negotiations. Communists widely believe that the Soviet Union is very willing to sign an alliance treaty with Yugoslavia, but only if Yugoslavia first requests it. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

Budapest – It has been learned here that Germany and Yugoslavia plan to conduct negotiations to sway Yugoslavia further towards the Axis. The Yugoslav ambassador to the Soviet Union, Gavrilović, is now departing to return home, intending to report to Prince Paul on the Soviet Union's attitude towards these negotiations. It is expected that the Yugoslav ambassador will arrive in Belgrade tonight. Yugoslav leaders are currently awaiting the Soviet Union's expression of its attitude before deciding to what extent they should cooperate with the Axis powers. It is rumored that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković will travel to Berlin on Thursday. According to official explanations, the Foreign Minister's trip to Germany has been postponed due to "issues related to the draft treaty." (International News Service dispatch, 16th)

### Italian Forces Suffer Another Defeat in Albania; Commander-in-Chief Reportedly Dismissed; Mussolini Quietly Returns to Capital

Athens – A Greek spokesman declared yesterday that the Italian forces in Albania have recently suffered another defeat. Italian forces, assisted by artillery and aircraft, launched a fierce attack on the central sector twice yesterday, but were repelled by Greek troops. The Italian forces retreated in disarray. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

Athens – Italian forces launched a counterattack on the northern Albanian front for three days. It is reported that 350 Italian soldiers were captured as a result. This counterattack completely collapsed by Friday night. Italian casualties were heavy. Greek troops still hold all their positions and their morale is very high. Only occasional machine gun fire was heard on the front lines yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Athens – General Cavallero, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in Albania, has not signed any Italian military orders in the past ten days. It is rumored that he has resigned or been dismissed by the Italian government. Although this news has not yet been confirmed here, Italian military orders are now being signed by General Giroso, commander of the Italian Eleventh Army. Therefore, the rumor of Cavallero's resignation seems to have some basis. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Yugoslav Capital – According to reports received here, Italian forces continued to launch vigorous attacks on Greek positions yesterday. In the past sixteen hours, Italian forces launched a total of five attacks on the central front line. Greek troops suffered heavy losses. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)

Cairo – Yesterday's British Air Force bulletin stated that on March 11th, British anti-aircraft guns destroyed four aircraft of unknown nationality in the Aquila area of Cyrenaica Province in Greece. On March 13th, Greek anti-aircraft guns also destroyed two Italian bombers in Kythira and damaged several others. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Rome – According to semi-official sources, Mussolini yesterday met with several Italian manufacturing inventors, who reported to Mussolini on important issues related to new war implements. This news indicates that Mussolini has returned to Rome after personally supervising the war effort in Albania. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

London – A Reuters correspondent in Athens reports that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini promised Fascist leaders on March 23rd that he would launch a decisive spring counteroffensive. Now, this promise has failed miserably, and Mussolini's hope of appearing before his own people as a triumphant hero has been tragically dashed. The Greek army's capture of a key Italian position at Tepelene at the end of last week has shattered all of Mussolini's hopes, leaving only a defeated army with a total of 15,000 killed, wounded, and captured. The Italian offensive was well-organized, and the soldiers were willing to fight. Mussolini personally supervised the battle from an armored car, issuing a strategy of fierce attacks with the orders that those who retreated would be shot and those who advanced would be rewarded. But it was all in vain, and the battlefield, extending for 15 miles and crisscrossed with dangerous cliffs and ravines, became the burial ground for the Fascist army. Regardless of the cost, Mussolini spurred new troops from Italy, along with reorganized troops previously defeated, well-trained Alpine troops, and valiant Blackshirts, to launch suicidal attacks against the well-defended Greek positions, supported by artillery. However, the Greek artillery fire was accurate, and the Italian soldiers fell one after another, engaging in mortal combat with guns and cannons. Their corpses littered the fields, and blood flowed in the wilderness, but they could not succeed and had to retreat in disgrace. Those who accompanied Mussolini to the front to observe the battle included former Secretary-General of the Fascist Party, Starace, and former Chief of the General Staff, General Badoglio.

### Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers Held in Berlin; Hitler Personally Delivers Speech

Berlin – A memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the last war and the current war will be held here this afternoon. Führer Hitler will also go to the war memorial to lay a wreath. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)

Berlin – This afternoon, Hitler, accompanied by General Göring, Admiral Raeder, and General Brauchitsch, attended a solemn ceremony at the Berlin Armory to commemorate the fallen soldiers. Hitler delivered a speech. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)

Berlin – This afternoon, Hitler delivered a speech at the Armory, the main points of which were as follows:

   *  British forces have indiscriminately attacked Germany's allies during the winter. In the future, German forces will make British forces feel the terror of being attacked. No matter how much other countries help, they still cannot save Britain from its misfortune.
   *  On this day last year, we gathered here to commemorate the martyrs, deeply understanding and admiring their sincerity, which words cannot fully express. Fortunately, we had already won victories at the beginning of the war. The circumstances in which we find ourselves this year make us feel even more excited and honored when we remember the martyrs.
   *  The enemy failed to recognize the current situation and misunderstood the military strength of themselves and Germany. They rashly and arbitrarily believed that it was possible to defeat the German army again, forcing Germany to fight. As General Wood of the United States proved, Churchill expressed his desire to fight Germany again in 1936, which proves who is responsible for the war.
   *  A small number of politicians and financiers in Britain and France attempted to wage war, encouraging Poland to be their vanguard in the hope of dispersing Germany's forces. Unexpectedly, the German army launched an attack in just eighteen days, shattering their hopes.
   *  On April 9th, the German army occupied Denmark and invaded Oslo, Norway. Britain's plan to descend from the north to directly attack Germany's defense center was also shattered. This move has a very significant impact on the future of the war.
   *  The year 1940 will be recorded in history with several major events, with extremely important consequences. Therefore, I dare to announce to the world on the day of commemorating the martyrs that this war will be the most glorious victory in German history.
   *  The German warriors who died in the previous World War, although their bodies are gone, their spirit lives on. Their heroic spirit has been passed on to their descendants. The people of Germany today are gladly encouraging each other to complete the legacy of their ancestors.
   *  Today, in addition to commemorating the martyrs, we also commemorate our Italian comrades who are sacrificing their lives in distant lands, sharing the same ideals and sharing both good and bad fortune.
   *  In this war, not only German men are contributing, but German women are also proving their ability to resist. Their heroic spirit proves that the whole country is united.
   *  During this winter's operations, naval personnel and air force soldiers have repeatedly performed outstanding feats, which are particularly admirable.
   *  Britain and France declared war. In addition to implementing the old trick of blockade, stubbornly wanting to starve German women and children to death, Britain also indiscriminately bombed towns, randomly dropped incendiary bombs, and brutally massacred civilians. They also want to fight to the end. Not only will they not be able to destroy Germany, but they will also receive retribution. In 1941, the German people will be united, with a calm attitude and strong perseverance, to strive to complete the great cause created last year.
   *  Achieving the final victory is our most solemn and grand expression of gratitude to the martyrs. The martyrs sacrificed their lives for the motherland and compatriots. What we are trying to save is also the motherland and compatriots. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)

### British Planes Bomb German Oil Refineries

London – Last night was the fourth night of Germany's intensified bombing of Britain. London was also subjected to air raids. In the initial hours, at least two areas within the city of London were hit by German flares and incendiary bombs. The British Air Ministry announced after the air raid that last night the British Air Force dispatched two to three hundred bombers to launch a fierce attack on important German targets for the third night. The Ruhr industrial area and coastal bases from Norway to Brest were all hit. British Air Force bombers also attacked the synthetic oil plant in Gelsenkirchen and the important munitions factory in Düsseldorf in batches, turning them into ruins. The Gelsenkirchen synthetic oil plant is where the Germans convert coal into gasoline for bombers. (International News Service dispatch, 16th)

London – Officials confirmed that five German planes were shot down on Friday night when German planes came to bomb London by moonlight.

### British and French Ambassadors Visit Hull to Discuss Food Issues; Food for the French Free Zone Should Not Benefit the Enemy; Britain May Not Object to Its Import

Washington – British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, visited Secretary of State Hull this morning for discussions. Afterwards, Ambassador Halifax told reporters that although the meeting was to discuss general issues, it is generally believed that the French food problem was one of the main issues discussed by both sides. According to British sources here, the British government's view on this issue is exactly the same as that of the United States. In other words, if it can be fully guaranteed that the food shipped to the French Free Zone will not be shipped out to supply the German army, then Britain will not object to transporting food to the French Free Zone. It is likely that this attitude has been explained to Secretary of State Hull by Ambassador Halifax. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

London – US Secretary of State Hull held talks with British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, yesterday to discuss the French food issue. According to Washington news, well-informed sources believe that the British government may make some concessions to the current blockade under the following conditions: 1. It is firmly guaranteed that all food shipped to France will not be intercepted by Germany. 2. It is firmly guaranteed that this food will not be enjoyed by the French in the current French Free Zone who are serving Germany. 3. The French government provides guarantees, stating that future actions will not exceed the scope of the Franco-German armistice agreement. In addition, political figures in Washington strongly emphasized that the US government has not exerted any pressure on Britain regarding this matter. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Washington – French Ambassador to the United States, Henri-Haye, visited Secretary of State Hull today to report on the food supply situation in France, lasting for an hour. Secretary of State Hull immediately replied that the US government is eager to help France solve this problem. "I have already started contacting the British authorities, and an agreement will be reached soon. In short, my party will do everything possible to gradually bring the views of Britain and France on the food issue closer together and be able to reach a compromise." Afterwards, Ambassador Henri-Haye told reporters that the French people are suffering unspeakable pain due to food shortages. The French government will definitely be able to accept a suggestion that the food shipped to the country be supervised and distributed by the United States. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### Weekly War Situation: March 9th to March 15th

Chongqing – A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission today discussed the situation on various fronts over the past week with reporters as follows:

Guangdong – Japanese forces, with nearly 10,000 land, sea, and air forces, have successively landed at various ports along the southern Guangdong coast. Over the past week, they have been strongly intercepted by Chinese troops, and pursued and annihilated, forcing them to abandon their attempts to blockade and starve the area. The Japanese troops who landed in this area were counterattacked by Chinese troops on the night of the 6th, and by noon on the 8th, Dianbai City and Yongdong City were recovered simultaneously. The Chinese troops counterattacking Yangjiang drove the Japanese out to sea on the 8th, and Yangjiang was also recovered. On the night of the 5th, the Japanese forces entered Sanbu, but were recaptured by Chinese troops at 10:00 on the 6th. The defeated Japanese forces fled in two routes, north and south. The Chinese troops on the north route have already crossed Chenchong and are pursuing closely. The Chinese troops on the south route captured Taishan City on the morning of the 10th, continued to capture Doushan on the 12th, and are advancing on Guanghaizhai. The Japanese are currently covering the remnants to board ships, and it is expected that the area can be cleared soon.

Jiangxi – At 2:00 PM on the 9th, Chinese forces used a surprise force to cut off the Japanese retreat route, and Wuning was captured by the Chinese. Over the past two days, they have also captured Guanyinge, Baiqiu, Huanbu, Zhongheng, Luoping, and other places in succession, and are currently following and pursuing the Japanese who are retreating towards Ruoxi.

Hubei – The Japanese forces who have been attacking from across the river from Yichang have increased to over 20,000 in the past few days. Under the cover of over 20 aircraft and artillery fire, they have launched attacks in three routes, intending to deal with the Chinese field army, strike the Chinese forces, and seize Chinese strongholds to consolidate the periphery of Yichang. However, they were met with a heroic counterattack by the Chinese army. By 9:00 AM on the 11th, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and had to retreat towards Huangnikeng. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to capture Xianglingkou, Daqiaobian, Taipingqiao, and other places. On the morning of the 12th, they continued to capture Huangnikeng. The Japanese army now only occupies a stronghold on Jifushan by the river to cover their retreat and transport the bodies. The Ruanjiatang and Xiangzikou areas have been completely captured by the Chinese. Also, on the evening of the 12th, the Chinese army near Tongcheng suddenly launched a fierce attack on Tongcheng. At 12:00 at night, they captured Xishan, Yufengshan, Wulipai, and other places. At dawn on the 13th, Tongcheng was recovered. The remnant Japanese forces fled north. The Chinese army has already pursued and crossed Tiezhugang, pressing close to Dashaping. The amount of military supplies abandoned by the Japanese in the city was unprecedented. The Chinese are currently investigating.

Anhui – The Japanese army, gathered from Quanjiao, Dingyuan, and Chaoxian counties, numbered nearly 10,000 and attacked the Chinese field army east of the railway. Guhe was captured by the Japanese on the 3rd, but was recaptured on the 4th. The Japanese forces fled westward in three routes. On the morning of the 8th, the Chinese army captured Dongguan in Chaoxian County. A part of the mercenary army in Tianjiawan also revolted at the same time. The entire railway line from Lintou to Yuxi was destroyed. On the 10th, Chinese artillery destroyed a Japanese train traveling from Yuxi to Dongguan.

Shanxi – The Japanese forces in Huguan, Yincheng, Gaoping, and other places in southeastern Shanxi have been launching attacks on Lingchuan in separate routes since the 6th, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the Guojiawan area. In order to escape the Japanese encirclement attempt, the Chinese army withdrew from Lingchuan on the evening of the 7th and is currently operating in a mobile posture around the Japanese periphery. On the evening of the 10th, over 2,000 Japanese forces from Jiangnan, Henglingguan, and other places attacked the Cuigailiing (east of Jiang) area. By the 11th, the number had increased to over 4,000. That night, a part of them infiltrated DaHuangshan (northwest of Xisangchi) but were intercepted by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. That night, another part of the Chinese army suddenly broke into the Japanese rear between Henglingguan and Yanzhang, seizing many gains. The Japanese forces attacking the Zhaishangcun and Fanshuzhang areas from Yicheng and Houma increased to over 4,000 in the morning. By the morning of the 10th, a part of the Japanese army in Fanshuzhang was repelled by the Chinese army.

Other – There was slight activity and contact between Chinese and Japanese forces in northern Hunan. (Dispatch, 16th)

### South African Prime Minister Speaks on the War Situation; Free People Holding Spears Will Eventually Defeat the Enemy

Cape Town – South African Prime Minister General Smuts returned here yesterday from inspecting Cairo and the African battlefields. In his speech, he said that the outcome is beyond doubt. 1941 may be one of the darkest years in history, but the result has been determined. The free people holding spears to defend against the enemy will eventually defeat the enemy and protect their freedom for their descendants. Hitler's plans have been overturned by the development of the West and the Mediterranean countries. Hitler hoped to destroy London to break the spirit of resistance of the British people, but the result was only to make this spirit of resistance stronger, like indestructible steel. Hitler's major plan to attack Britain by sea, land, and air has not yet been realized, but Hitler must now know that this is an extremely dangerous move, which will put himself and his country at great risk. The defeat of the Italian army is also one of the reasons why Hitler's plan cannot be realized. He must now find a way to save himself. As the war spreads, the future of the Axis powers will become worse and worse. The situation Hitler will face this spring is very different from last spring. Mussolini has already been defeated, and Hitler has also failed to achieve the effect of attacking Britain by air. Since the air raid has been unsuccessful, invading Britain is impossible. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

London – The British Broadcasting Corporation issued a message today stating that the climate in the English Channel has now improved, making it the most suitable time to invade the British mainland.

### Major Battle Expected in the Atlantic, Prediction by Italian Newspaper

Rome - Major Triggiano, a military expert for the Roman newspaper "Il Popolo di Roma," published an article yesterday predicting a major battle in the Atlantic. It stated that this war is completely different from the last World War. In addition to submarines, there will be cruisers, mines, aircraft, and other participants in the naval battle. Although the exact number of German submarines cannot be known due to military secrets, during the last war, German shipyards were able to produce 33 submarines per month. From November 1939 to March 15th of this year, an average of 509,250 tons of enemy ships were sunk per month. In this war, Germany also occupies the seaports of Flanders, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and France, so the power of its submarines will inevitably be greater than in the last war. At the same time, German cruisers can also participate in the battle. In addition, there are also aircraft bombing British seaports, which was not seen in the last war. As for the results of mines, it is reported that 1,910,000 tons of British ships were sunk in February of this year, accounting for 25 percent of the total British tonnage.

### International Anecdotes (10): American President Serving a Third Term - Notes on Roosevelt's Daily Life

On January 20, 1941, Roosevelt was sworn in as President of the United States, marking his third consecutive term, a historical first for America. Throughout his eight years in office, Roosevelt has shouldered countless heavy responsibilities. Looking back at history, the difficulties faced by the head of state in dealing with the current crisis in the United States are similar to those faced by Lincoln during his first term and Wilson during his second term.

In the eyes of Americans and the world, the actions of the White House occupant can represent the entire United States. He sets an example and implements all political decisions without the slightest error. Even if subordinates make mistakes, he must bear full responsibility. A word or action by the American President regarding European and Asian wars and international relations can be seen as an expression of American attitude. Roosevelt is truly of great importance, and cannot act rashly.

Based on his experience of eight years in office, Roosevelt can be considered a veteran president. He has a deep understanding of how to be a modern president. During his first two terms, the world was already turbulent and full of troubles. As for his current third term, the situation has intensified, and difficulties are piling up. However, he deals with them with ease and does not panic. His ability to "perform the duties of president" is truly exceptional.

All day long, President Roosevelt handles countless matters. The length of his working hours is unprecedented among American presidents. This may be because since his first term in 1933, he has always regarded the American Presidential Palace as an emergency management center. However, those who know him all understand that he can handle everything under any circumstances. Moreover, Roosevelt is a neurotic person, and if he is idle, he will feel restless.

In the White House, President Roosevelt's daily life and work habits have long been established. He has a habit of waking up late and going to bed late, and he enjoys reading in bed, so he doesn't sleep until after midnight. As a result, he doesn't wake up until after nine o'clock in the morning. After waking up, he still lingers in bed for an hour. During this hour, he eats scrambled eggs, toast, and coffee for breakfast, and takes the opportunity to open confidential letters, the list of visitors for the day, two or three notes, and several newspapers. He reads five or six newspapers every day and occasionally checks the news strips from the news ticker.

At ten o'clock, he goes to the Presidential Palace. The day's work can be roughly divided into two parts: from ten o'clock in the morning to one o'clock in the afternoon, he receives pre-arranged visitors, allocating fifteen minutes to each person, and then has lunch. The meal time is one hour, and he often uses this time to discuss matters with people. From two o'clock to half-past five in the afternoon, he talks to various government officials and handles official business. In terms of office work, Roosevelt works five days a week, but on Saturdays and Sundays, he is always preoccupied with official matters. Whether the president is in Washington or away from the capital, these days – which can be called days of mental exertion – he answers many letters that require his personal reply and browses reports from experts in the government or in the field. These reports are always piled up in a wire basket, which is moved from the president's desk to his bedside table every night and back to the Presidential Palace the next morning. After he finishes, he adds notes on the paper or orders his attendants to record his opinions.

The president's annotated notes are quickly and accurately sent to the hands of senior officials in various departments. They can also communicate with the president by telephone at any time. Roosevelt spends almost a quarter of his working time on the telephone. Cabinet members can call him at any time to discuss national affairs. The number of important figures at all levels who are qualified to call President Roosevelt is between fifty and one hundred. As soon as the White House telephone operator receives their calls, they immediately connect them to the president.

In addition to the above-mentioned daily routine, President Roosevelt also has to supervise and guide various political affairs, such as public meetings, reading reports, and letters. From these, he decides at any time the position he expresses in his "fireside chats" or in his speeches to Congress regarding policy and legislative proposals.

When Roosevelt first became president, the United States was facing a serious economic problem. During this third term, he encountered national defense problems, causing a great deal of trouble. In these different environments, the various political reports he reads at night and the various meetings he holds during the day cannot escape this circle. On March 4, 1933, when Roosevelt first took office as president, he was 51 years old, at a time when the country was in an economic panic and banks were collapsing. This third term, he is already 59 years old. Although he is older, his spirit is still very full. Correspondents stationed in Washington for various newspapers always see, at the reception every Tuesday, in an oval room with old ship maps and ship models hanging on the walls, behind a desk piled with many trinkets, a man with a ruddy complexion and radiant spirit sitting there. Roosevelt's hair is grayer and slightly thinner than in 1933. His face is more composed, and the lines are deeper. Apart from that, everything remains the same as before. When answering a question, he always maintains the posture of suddenly raising his head. Between answering questions, his eyes are still bright, staring directly from one person's face to another. He holds a thin cigarette holder in his mouth, and after finishing one cigarette, he continues to smoke a second one. All these habits can be remembered by those who often attend the Presidential Palace press conferences.

Having said that, it is indeed a difficult task for Roosevelt to shoulder heavy responsibilities and face a multitude of problems during his terms as president. Therefore, although he often displays a pleasant impression, there are inevitably hidden worries in his heart. At the press conference, when the urgent issue of the battle between democracy and dictatorship is raised, he may appear extremely optimistic on the surface, but journalists with eight years of experience understand that Roosevelt's true feelings are not easily revealed. He always tries to leave the best impression on people and knows how to use humorous answers to deal with various questions he does not want to answer.

In short, President Roosevelt has not only taken on the responsibilities of the United States but also the greatest responsibility in the world. Observers in Washington generally believe that the situation is serious, but they are not worried about him. The greatest determination he has expressed regarding national defense issues is something he has never expressed since taking office as president. He is certainly older than when he was first elected president, but with age comes deeper experience. However, in terms of his beliefs and passionate emotions, he is still like he was on March 4, 1933, the day he declared to the nation, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."

### Urging Large-Scale Hoarders to Sell, Aiming to Suppress Rice Prices, Rice Shops Demand Daily Supply of 10,000 Bags, Strict Prohibition of Price Gouging Purchases from the Market, Food Subcommittee Has Prepared a Report and Submitted it to the Board of Directors

The food situation of the city's residents. After the Concession authorities arrested rice merchants who violated the order in the market last weekend, the rampant atmosphere has calmed down slightly. However, large-scale hoarders and speculators still need the authorities to strictly enforce inspections as soon as possible, so that the general villains realize that speculative activities are not only harmful to the food of all citizens, but also violate national law. Although they can temporarily enjoy peace, they will eventually be punished one day. According to a reporter from "Ping Ming She" who inquired with sources close to the Concession authorities yesterday, the Public Concession's Board of Works held several meetings of the Food Subcommittee in the middle of last week, prepared a report, and scheduled it to be submitted for discussion at the Board of Directors' regular meeting the day after tomorrow (Wednesday). Once the Board of Directors approves it, detailed measures to stabilize the food supply will be promulgated.

Rice Shops Demand Daily Supply of 10,000 Bags

The city's Miscellaneous Rice Industry, Rice Shops, and three other organizations held joint meetings last week to discuss ways to stabilize the rice market, but due to divergent opinions, they lacked the ability to implement them, resulting in no results. According to the reporter's inquiries, the rice shops' urgent opinion is to demand that the Rice Industry supply cash goods to the city's rice shops as much as possible, at least 10,000 bags per day. Otherwise, retail sales will be difficult to cope with. Although the Miscellaneous Grain Shops and Rice Shops sell off goods every day, sometimes exceeding 10,000 bags, they are purchased by speculators at inflated prices, making it difficult for the rice shops to purchase them. Therefore, the cause of the rice price increase lies here. The stable and effective method is still to thoroughly implement the sale of goods from the rice farms to the shops, and from the shops to the rice retailers.

Expert Discusses Ways to Suppress Prices

According to an expert who expressed his opinion on the city's rice problem yesterday, the current price of food in the city is manipulated by speculators. The price is no longer determined according to normal supply and demand. This is not only related to the livelihood of citizens, but also harmful to merchants who operate rice businesses legitimately. There are two types of people participating in rice speculation: (1) those who have a large amount of floating capital, and (2) those who are willing to be used by speculators. The former order large quantities of rice from foreign rice firms, transport them to Shanghai for hoarding, and wait for a good price to sell them. Sometimes, in order to achieve their desire to obtain huge profits, they raise prices to buy cash goods in the market. However, if there is no one to be used by them, it is difficult to achieve their goal. Therefore, to stabilize the rice market, it is useless not to ban this type of person. However, to ban the former, it is necessary to consult with the city's rice firms. To ban the latter, it is necessary for people in the rice industry to break away from sentimentality and report them. Therefore, it is best for the authorities to convene a large-scale rice firm, representatives from various rice industry organizations, and representatives from the transportation industry to discuss and resolve this difficult problem.

The Root Cause of the Rice Price Increase

According to the rice industry yesterday, the price of rice in the city had an upward trend during the Shanghai War. A Food Regulation Association was organized, which aimed to suppress rice prices and dredge sources. After the war, traffic was blocked, and sources became problematic. The price of rice rose daily. The Rice Industry Association voluntarily limited prices, but due to various transportation and exchange rate issues, it could not be implemented. The industry believes that its ability is insufficient and only advocates group rice purchases, so that the market demand can be reduced. It is also a method to stop the rise in rice prices. Unfortunately, very few people joined the group purchase at that time, and it did not show any results. Now, the rice supply in Shanghai...

To make a large amount of domestic rice arrive in Shanghai, there is still no hope. The environment dictates that people must rely on foreign rice. Since foreign rice has repeatedly increased in price, the Rice Evaluation Committee was organized. At first, the evaluation of rice prices was still implemented. After a long time, the market price became chaotic. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) Some people took the opportunity to buy up goods at inflated prices, adding three to five yuan per bag to the market price. The number of purchases was huge, even refusing any warehouse receipts less than ten bags. A small number of rice merchants, with a heavy desire for profit, fell into the trap. The food problem became...

Irreparable

Situation. (2) Foreigners often say that they would rather have expensive rice than no rice, and that supply and demand should be balanced, and the rice price will be flat by itself. This statement seems credible, but it is not suitable for today's Shanghai rice market in an extraordinary environment. (3) According to investigations, half of the rice stored in various warehouses is owned by the financial community, and half is hoarded by those with wealth. Relying on their strong power, they have been storing it for a long time and refuse to let go. They are also worried about the devaluation of legal currency, believing that rice is real goods and that hoarding it can maintain the original wealth.

Anxious and Overthinking

As a result, the foreign exchange becomes tighter, and rice hoarding becomes more intense. Cause and effect multiply, and the rice price presents today's situation. (4) Shipping costs have soared. The current price is 125 shillings per ton, an increase of more than 40 shillings in two weeks. (5) Foreign rice orders for January and February have not been fully delivered, and the quota for March and April is even smaller. The harsh conditions of foreign firms make it hard for outsiders to believe. A deposit of half the rice price must be paid first, and the risks along the way are borne by the merchants themselves. Legitimate rice merchants are hesitant, and the ambitions of adventurers are naturally difficult to restrain.

Thoroughly Investigate Hoarders, Do Not Delay Any Longer

The rice industry, in view of the fact that the market situation has indeed reached a dangerous level, currently asks the authorities to consult with the Hong Kong authorities as soon as possible to allow foreign rice to pass through Hong Kong to Shanghai as much as possible. It also advises rice merchants to sell at the purchase price plus legitimate profits and not to be greedy and resell for foreign transport. For hoarded rice, it should be forced to be sold. It is also hoped that the authorities will strictly prohibit private smuggling out of the country. As for the thorough investigation of rice hoarders, the rice warehouses in Shanghai are mostly located along the Pudong and Yangshupu areas, and the execution of joint authority will be costly. If only the warehouses within the two concession areas are investigated, it is feared that the stored rice will be forced to be moved to the Pudong area, which would result in no rice available for purchase in the two concessions. However, regarding the supply, the large hoarders in the financial community mostly reside in the concessions. The authorities can explain the importance of the matter and order them to sell to rice merchants within the concessions. The authorities are currently carefully considering this matter.

### The Education Association Cables Mao Zedong, Offering Honest Advice, Hoping to Abandon Selfishness and Fulfill Promises, Support Unity and Be Loyal to the Country

The Education Association of this city, because the seven councilors including Mao Zedong did not attend this session of the Political Consultative Conference and made demands, sent a cable offering honest advice, emphasizing the importance of unity and following the leader's instructions to work for the country. The original cable is recorded below:

Grief to Loved Ones, Joy to Enemies

To the Honorable Mao Zedong, Chen Shaoyu, Qin Bangxian, Lin Zuhan, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, and other councilors in Yan'an, Northern Shaanxi: Having read the newspapers, we have learned that when the councilors met for this session of the Political Consultative Conference, you submitted twelve articles each of "Remedial Measures" and "Temporary Solutions" as conditions for attending. Furthermore, because your demands were not met, you refused to participate. Although this decision of yours is the action of a very small number of people and does not have a great impact on national spiritual unity or the overall prospect of resisting and building, the impact on international opinion and national psychology has left an extremely bad impression. Inappropriate behavior and improper actions cause grief to loved ones and joy to enemies. We deeply disapprove of your actions.

Contradictory Words and Actions

Since the "September 18th Incident," Japan's ambitions have become increasingly rampant, and the difficulties have become increasingly deep. Those with aspirations all know that it is necessary for the whole country to unite and work together to resist and seek survival. At that time, you also advocated the idea of a united front, advocating supporting unity, implementing the Three Principles of the People. The government, recognizing that you had realized the folly of internal strife, disregarded past grievances, treated you with sincerity, and united against foreign enemies. Over the years, thanks to the heroic struggles of the soldiers at the front and the active efforts of the people in the rear, the Japanese have been unable to extricate themselves. Now that the Japanese forces are declining and the economy is facing difficulties, our country's military strength is increasing day by day, and international assistance is constantly increasing. It is time to concentrate our forces and launch a full-scale counterattack to give them a final blow. However, you have suddenly taken actions that undermine unity and betray discipline at this critical juncture. How can your words and actions be so contradictory?

The New Fourth Army's Punishment is Well-Deserved

In the demands you have made, it is because of the disbandment of the New Fourth Army that you cannot help but feel indignant. It is important to know that the way to military victory is to first emphasize the absolute adherence to military discipline and the absolute unity of military orders. Recalling the time of the First European War, the British and American Allied Forces were under the unified command of French General Foch in order to achieve victory. Now that our country is at war, if we want to achieve results, then in battle, advances and retreats should all be according to the orders of the Supreme Commander. As for friendly forces, they should actively assist and jointly rescue each other in order to concentrate forces to resist foreign enemies together. However, the New Fourth Army troops have, in recent years, in the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui, disobeyed military orders, attacked friendly forces, and disrupted administrative systems. Their various actions of betraying the country and undermining resistance and construction are countless. What we have heard and witnessed cannot be overturned or erased by any propaganda. Therefore, their punishment is well-deserved.

Political Institutions are Improving Day by Day

As for political improvement, it cannot be achieved overnight. Only with correct goals and persistent efforts can it be achieved. Since the start of the war, our country's political facilities have been improving day by day, such as the promulgation of the Resistance and Construction Program, the convening of the Political Consultative Conference as scheduled, the accelerated implementation of the New County System, and the active preparations for the National Assembly. All of these show the trend of political organization towards democracy and the widespread development of direct civil rights. If the people of the country can恪遵恪守 the laws and regulations and implement them in practice, it will promote the implementation of constitutional government. Why must you resort to coercive means to undermine unity and divide solidarity? Observing the recent evolution of the European War, it is even more evident that the world is changing rapidly. To strive for self-reliance, it is necessary to concentrate national strength, build national defense, enforce strict military orders and discipline, and enhance combat power. All theories and party interests that are not conducive to the national struggle must be completely eliminated so that the whole country, from top to bottom, becomes a solid fighting force in order to establish an independent nation forever.

Abandon Preconceptions, Fulfill Promises

Therefore, the people of the country are now deeply aware that the important task at hand is to abandon the interests of the individual to seek the survival of the nation. So-called national independence and freedom first, sovereignty, integrity, and unity first. As the saying goes, "If the skin does not exist, what will the hair attach to?" If the nation-state cannot be liberated, how can there be any talk of the welfare of the people? You are intelligent and confident and must thoroughly understand these simple and basic common sense. We sincerely hope that you will prioritize the nation and state, abandon narrow prejudices, fulfill your promises made in 1937, support unity, be loyal to the country, sincerely cooperate, unite to resist foreign enemies, obey the orders of the Supreme Authorities, and strive to prepare for a counterattack. Then, the time of final victory will be the day of national liberation. If you do not do this and act arbitrarily, then dividing unity and undermining resistance and construction will make you sinners of the nation, subject to the condemnation of thousands of years. What to do, we hope you will quickly plan for it. We extend our sincere prayers and wish you national liberation. The Shanghai Education Association bows.

### Japan Further Expands Blockade of Fujian Coast, Fuzhou and Other Ports Will Stop Customs Clearance

Since the Japanese side announced the implementation of the blockade of Chinese coastal ports on July 16th of last year under the pretext of "military necessity," the result has been that foreign merchant ships sailing along the coast have been hindered and squeezed out. In reality, the Japanese blockade attempt has completely failed. Tada Hayao, Commander of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, announced on the 15th, again under the pretext of "military needs," that from today (17th), the "blockade" of the Chinese coast will be extended to Fuqing and other ports between Fuzhou and Xinghua in Fujian Province, prohibiting merchant ships from entering the Xiangjiao connecting line, the Haitanjiao connecting line, and the Strait of Haitan including Haitan Island and nearby waters. The Jianghai Customs will, at the request of the Japanese side, stop customs clearance at Guqing and nearby ports from today. The purpose of the Japanese announcement to expand the blockade is clearly to squeeze out foreign merchant shipping operations along the coast. Chinese imports of military supplies are now routed through the Yunnan-Burma Road and the Sino-Soviet Highway lines, which are not affected in the slightest.

### Labor Dispute Resolved at British-Owned "Xiang Tai" Lumber Company

### China's "White Coolie"

— Yu Zhen

This article was written by the famous American journalist Edgar Snow. The original was published in the American "Saturday Evening Post." Here is an abridged translation:

It is rare for foreigners to establish great enterprises in China, which makes Rewi Alley one of the few exceptions. Just as Colonel Lawrence of Britain was immortalized for guiding guerrilla tactics in Arabia, Rewi Alley can be compared to Lawrence for guiding the construction of guerrilla industries in China.

Rewi Alley is a New Zealander who, at the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in July of the 27th year of the Republic of China [1938], resigned from his position as the chief factory inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and was hired by the Chinese government as the chief advisor to the Industrial Cooperatives. At that time, the cooperatives were merely organizations in name only, and eight or nine out of ten of China's pre-war industries were destroyed by artillery fire or unable to operate. Rewi Alley single-handedly built new production enterprises from the wreckage to meet the needs of Free China.

Today, the development of "Gung Ho" [Industrial Cooperatives] enterprises is surging like a tide across China. As of early November of last year, there were already more than 2,400 cooperative factories scattered across sixteen provinces in China. Their scope extends from the guerrilla areas occupied by the Japanese army to the Great Rear Area of China, from the Mongolian Plateau to the mountains of Yunnan. The guerrillas directly supported by local cooperatives across China number 250,000.

Rewi Alley has been in China for many years and has adopted two Chinese orphans as his godchildren, sending them to St. John's University in Shanghai. These two children are very intelligent, and one was even elected class leader. Rewi Alley often said, "The leaders of China may not know the capabilities of their own people, because if you cultivate any Chinese child wandering on the streets, you can make him a good person. All he needs is a change of environment."

Rewi Alley is a man of perseverance and inspiration, a 42-year-old bachelor. His father was a farmer and amateur scientist who devoted himself to rural cooperation and agricultural factory enterprises for twenty years. Rewi Alley was influenced by his father from a young age, and later participated in the First European War, earning a medal. Later, he came to Shanghai to serve as a factory inspector for the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. During this time, he saw that the organization of Chinese factories was not well-organized and needed to be improved, so he went to London, Berlin, Paris, and other places to study the industrial systems of various advanced countries. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he repeatedly advised people that "Chinese industry is hopeless unless someone invents a method to use scientific facilities to mobilize the nation's labor and resources, so that the surplus manpower and materials are no longer abandoned." As a result, he himself invented a production method suitable for wartime and peacetime, namely, setting up small industrial cooperatives in various villages and towns, so that Japanese aircraft would have no concentrated bombing targets, and both labor and capital could truly cooperate.

This system is indeed very appropriate for the actual situation in China. First, after the outbreak of the war, most of the Chinese interior was blockaded, and it was impossible to be self-sufficient without local production. Second, China has endless labor, and tens of thousands of refugees can be trained to become workers. Third, China has endless reserves of natural resources, and it will never be easily occupied by others.

His plan was initially appreciated by the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. The ambassador introduced the plan to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife and recommended Rewi Alley to be in charge. Later, Rewi Alley was summoned by the Chinese government to Hankou, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife were deeply impressed by his plan. Madame Soong Ching-ling also believed that his plan was in line with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood.

Rewi Alley divided the front and rear areas of China into three major "industrial defense zones," establishing the lightest or mobile industries in the rear of the occupied areas or near the occupied areas, and establishing initial industries in the Great Rear Area. These factories are all self-contained units, procuring raw materials, recruiting labor, taking charge of transportation, training workers, and promoting sales.

Since the plan was so complex, it naturally required capable engineers or excellent technicians to lead it. He mobilized many students studying in the United States and asked them to set up schools to train workers. The funds allocated to them by the Chinese Executive Yuan were, needless to say, very small, but they were all willing to work hard. Later, another group of returned students and outstanding technicians joined their ranks, regardless of the amount of remuneration.

At present, tens of thousands of refugees and farmers are also being trained to become new workers. Moreover, tens of thousands of people can start working as soon as capital is secured. When the China Industrial Cooperatives recently held an exhibition in Chongqing, they displayed more than fifty kinds of products, almost including all daily necessities, which surprised people from all walks of life. The production of wartime supplies has also greatly increased.

Rewi Alley's spirit of hard work is indeed extraordinary. In the first year of "Gung Ho's" operation, he led "Gung Ho" cadres deep into the interior to guide industrial development in various regions, traveling 18,000 miles, mostly on foot.

The total value of the products produced by the industrial cooperatives is 150 million yuan per year. Recently, Chinese banks have joined with a capital of 40 million yuan, and the output can be greatly increased in the future. According to Rewi Alley, within three years, the total value of output can be increased to 100 million yuan per year. Although Rewi Alley has achieved extraordinary success, he is not complacent. He said, "Our goal is to set up 30,000 factories in the Chinese countryside, and I am just the first white coolie in China." As for the Chinese, they all call him "Mr. Big Nose."

### The Two Concessions' Electricity Saving Measures are Still Under Extensive Study. The Problem of Obtaining Fuel is Serious. Most Ships Have Been Requisitioned, and Transportation is Difficult.

The Municipal Authorities of the French Concession, due to the extreme difficulty of the French Water and Electricity Company in maintaining sufficient fuel oil for power generation, have announced strict restrictions on electricity consumption and are cooperating with the police to implement them. As for the military issue of the Public Concession, there are no new developments. The Shanghai Power Company and the Municipal Council are cooperating and are still striving to preserve the gradually decreasing amount of coal and find solutions for the future. The committee of three experts requested by the Municipal Council is currently engaged in extensive research on the electricity problem.

Fuel Supply is Very Serious

According to an employee of the Shanghai Power Company, the company normally consumes 1,000 tons of coal per day, half of which is supplied from India. The manager of the French Water and Electricity Company, Favre, refused to state how much fuel the company consumes daily or how much inventory it currently has, but acknowledged that the fuel supply problem is quite serious. It is said that the fuel used is purchased through various oil companies in the city, which is quite difficult due to shipping issues.

Reduced Ships, Difficult Transportation

It is found that after the outbreak of the European War, most ships were registered and requisitioned, resulting in a shortage that greatly affected the transportation of coal and oil from southern Asia to Shanghai. The Shanghai Power Company previously relied on coal transported from North China, but now, due to the Sino-Japanese War, the amount of coal transported from North China to Shanghai has greatly decreased. An employee of the Shanghai Power Company recently confirmed that it has appealed to the British Shipping Department and other international shipping companies for assistance in transporting coal, but there is no hope of success in the short term, as countries are fighting for survival and requisitioning ships, which is more important than the coal shortage problem in Shanghai. The employee also said that

Attempts to Dredge Ships Have Also Been Unsuccessful

The Shanghai Power Company has recently tried to obtain the assistance of the British government in order to recall the necessary ships that have been requisitioned to carry sufficient coal from India to supply Shanghai. At one point, there were fourteen ships from the Ma'anshan Company carrying coal for the Power Company, but now only two ships remain, and one of them is not allowed to sail north of Hong Kong, and the other is currently loading coal in Calcutta, but this ship may also be requisitioned. The most recent ship arrived in Shanghai on February 16, carrying 6,900 tons of coal. The Power Company has also appealed to Japanese, American, European, and Panamanian shipping companies for assistance, but without success. The difficulty lies in the fact that there is not enough cargo to carry when the ships return, and the freight is extremely expensive. Purchasing coal from India only has transportation difficulties, while purchasing coal from North China has the problem of whether or not it can be obtained, in addition to transportation difficulties.

Power Company Receives Reporters

The Shanghai Power Company of the Public Concession, due to the shortage of coal sources and the rapid increase in the amount of electricity required by various sectors, has submitted a request to the Municipal Council to reduce the supply of electricity, and the Municipal Council has formed a special small committee to carefully study the matter. Before a definite decision is reached, a temporary measure of reducing the supply by 30% will be implemented. The Shanghai Power Company, in order to clarify the reasons to all sectors, has scheduled to receive Chinese and foreign reporters at the company this morning, at which time the issue of reducing the electricity supply will be clarified.

### Soft Cork Stopper Merchant, Committed Suicide After Gambling Losses

Pan Naiquan, a native of Fuzhou, 46 years old this year, was engaged in the business of specializing in machinery, soft cork stoppers for various wineries and beverage manufacturers in Shanghai. On February 5, he checked into Room 434 on the fourth floor of the Asia Hotel at 135 Avenue Edward VII alone. Unfortunately, he was addicted to gambling, which led to losses and a high debt that he could not make up for. Lacking capital to turn around his business, he became despondent and hanged himself from the iron bed frame in his room yesterday morning. At noon, the waiter Bian Zonglian saw that Pan was still lying down and had not gotten up, so he entered the room to check and found Pan hanging himself. It was too late to save him, and he had already died. He immediately informed the accounting room and reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. They carried the body to the Renfu Yuan branch of the mortuary for an autopsy, and after the autopsy, they searched for the deceased's family to collect the body for burial.

### The Kidnappers in the Sun Zhiqi Case Repeatedly Committed Ransom Kidnapping Cases. Several More Cases Were Found During the Postponement. Victims All Testified in Court.

The Central Police Department last month solved the kidnapping case of Sun Zhiqi, the owner of the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road, and arrested more than ten kidnappers, including Chen Qilin, Yi Guoxiang, Wang Laiwen, Fu Baoshan, Zhao Changfa, Yang Guanglin, Wang Jinshan, Dong Rugui, Jin Shimin, Cai Jinpeng, and He Bufa. After being interrogated by the First Special Court, they were detained for investigation. During the postponement, several more cases of the defendants kidnapping Gu Dezhu, Hu Wugen, Ding Hongjin, and Wang Baohua for ransom were discovered. They were recently escorted to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special Court and prosecuted for the crime of kidnapping for ransom.

Kidnappers Attempt to Overturn Confessions

The judge, Feng, presided over the hearing and questioned the defendants (soldiers), Cai Jinpeng, etc., who mostly overturned the police confessions and denied kidnapping. Judge Feng then rigorously questioned the defendant Jin, "The confession you wrote in the police station is very clear. You said that your battalion commander had opened rooms in the Central and Huizhong hotels since early October of last year, planning to kidnap the owner of the Huizhong Hotel, and it was not a one-day plan. At 8:00 a.m. on October 31, you instructed you and Cai Jinpeng to each hold a Mauser pistol and stand in front of the Huizhong Hotel to watch. At 8:20 a.m., you saw Ding Afa and an unknown person from Zairen carrying an old man (Sun Zhiqi) about sixty years old out, boarding a pre-stopped car, and you and Cai also got into the car, heading towards the Bund. When the car reached the Waitanyidu Bridge, Wang said that there were too many people in the car and told you and Cai to get out. Later, the hostage was hidden in the Nanquiao area of Minhang Town, but you do not know the outcome. This confession is very clear, why do you want to retract your confession?" The defendant Jin stammered and did not answer.

Boy Describes Kidnapping Experience

The court then cross-examined the victim in another case, Gu Dezhu, who testified, "I am ten years old this year and attend the Shanghai Municipal Council Elementary School in Yuecun, Yuyuan Road. On the morning of November 18 last year, my servant Qian Fuju accompanied me to school. When passing Kena Road, I was ambushed by bandits, who grabbed me and put me in a car and drove away. At first, I was hidden in a thatched shed in the Jindutu Temple area. After a week, I was moved to a dilapidated wooden house in Xujiahui. I stayed there for more than thirty days before regaining my freedom. I don't know how much money my family spent because my parents don't want to tell me."

Child is Frightened and Dares Not Come to Court

According to Hu Fa, the mother of the victim Hu Yuangen, "My son was kidnapped, and a total of 12,000 yuan was paid for the ransom. Because the police station summoned him to identify the kidnappers, he was so frightened by the kidnappers that he returned home with a fever and chills, and he dares not come again today," etc. According to the victim Ding Hongru, "I am seventeen years old and an apprentice in a bean shop in Chengdu Road. I was mistakenly kidnapped by bandits in the store on the morning of November 2 last year and hidden in Xujiahui. Later, my uncle spent money to redeem me and bring me home. I don't know the amount."

University Student Has Been Away from Shanghai for a Long Time

Finally, Wang Yuelan, the sister of the victim Wang Baohua (a student at St. John's University), filed a case stating, "Because Shanghai is dangerous, my brother dares not study anymore, fearing that he will be kidnapped again, and has been away from Shanghai for a long time. At first, my brother wrote from the bandits' den saying that the kidnappers wanted a ransom of 1.2 million. Later, my brother came home and told me that he had escaped. Judge Feng asked, 'Didn't your brother say at the police station that he was redeemed for 700,000? How can you say he escaped?'" Wang replied, "I am not sure whether he escaped or was redeemed." The court, after verifying the facts, ordered that all the defendants be returned to custody and the hearing postponed to the 20th of this month.

### Six More Gambling Dens Open in Nanshi

### Jianghai Customs Clerk Zhang Yangyi Shot, Bullet Hits Leg, Assailant Flees

Yesterday at about 11:00 a.m., an assassination blood case occurred in the French Concession, but the victim was only hit by one bullet in the leg, with minor injuries. It is learned that a Jianghai Customs clerk named Zhang Yangyi, in his thirties, lived at 73, Lane 291, Avenue Alexandre VII, French Concession. At the time of the incident, Zhang was at home when an assassin suddenly broke into Zhang's room and, without asking any questions, pulled out a pistol and fired two shots at Zhang. One shot hit Zhang's leg, and he fell to the ground, bleeding. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the assassin fled out of the door without a trace. Later, the nearby patrolling police arrived after receiving the report, and the French police also sent a large team of Chinese and Western detectives to investigate.

### Found Senior High School Diploma, Calling for Owner

Dr. Jiang Fangjiu wrote a letter saying, "When I was working at the Fifth Refugee Hospital of the International Red Cross in the occupied area of Nanshi, I saw a Zhi Ren Yong Senior High School diploma at a used goods stall, in the name of Shen Naizheng. At that time, I bought it and brought it to the concession, intending to return it to the original owner.

### Grand Samsung Cup Concludes Successfully - Fan Hanqing Wins Championship - Exhibition Match: Jews Suffer Crushing Defeat - Chen Linsheng Defeats Mrs. Deeife

The second annual Grand Samsung Cup Individual Table Tennis Championship, sponsored by the Grand Samsung Restaurant, held its final yesterday at 2:00 PM on the third floor of the restaurant on Fourth Avenue. The final match was between Shi Jiaji and Fan Hanqing, with over one hundred guests in attendance, making it a grand occasion. Gu Zhiren delivered the closing speech first, followed by speeches from Wang Guiting and Hu Yukun. Then the individual final began, with Chen Linsheng, Feng Chanchu, and Ding Duyi serving as referees. Shi Jiaji was the runner-up in the previous tournament, and Fan Hanqing was the third-place finisher. Last year, Fan was defeated by Shi, but this time they met on a narrow road, and under pressure, Shi appeared flustered and failed to counter with topspin shots, resorting to short blocks instead, resulting in incorrect hits and losing two games in a row. The situation was quite dangerous, but fortunately, he fought hard and pulled back two games, tying the score at two games each. Fan could have taken the championship in one fell swoop, but his stamina failed him, and he almost gave away the championship he had within his grasp. In the final game, he launched a desperate attack, scoring repeatedly, while Shi's counterattacks were ineffective. In the end, he suffered a crushing defeat of two to three. As a result, Fan Hanqing came from behind to win the championship, and Shi was the runner-up. After a break, the exhibition match between Grand Samsung and the Jewish team took place. This match had an international character. Although the Grand Samsung players were not as experienced as the Jewish players, they fought with extra effort for the sake of glory. In the first match, Jewish star Deeife defeated Grand Samsung's Le Dezhi in straight sets. In the second match, Shi Jiaji displayed his prowess, defeating Krimsgei decisively by two games to zero. In the third match, Fan Hanqing faced Jewish strongman Fukulote. The two engaged in a hard-fought battle, and Fan, relying on his home advantage, defeated Fukulote by two games to one. The Grand Samsung team won by a score of two to one. The highlight of the evening was the match between Shanghai's leading female star, Mrs. Deeife, and the veteran Chen Linsheng, which attracted the attention of the entire audience. Mrs. Deeife's performance with the chop block was truly worthy of her reputation. Although Chen's topspin shots were fast, he was unable to break through her defensive skills. The two fought for three games, and Chen, relying on good fortune, won by a narrow margin of two games to one. After the match, Mr. Xu Shishu, a director of the restaurant, presented the awards, and the event concluded with a group photo. The results of the final and the exhibition match are recorded below:

### America's Silver and China's Currency

— By Esson E. Gale, Translated by Zhang Mingxiang

(Original title: "America's Silver to the Aid of China's Currency," published in Amerasia, December 1940)

The most obvious economic characteristics of the Sino-Japanese War are currency inflation and the decline of exchange rates (Note 1), and the increase in the means of purchase among the people. China has traditionally favored silver as currency. Before the United States began its silver purchasing policy in December 1933, China was one of the world's major silver-using countries. After the U.S. Treasury began buying silver on the market at high prices without limitation, a large amount of China's silver flowed out, causing a large contraction of China's currency and a rise in its transaction value. To prevent this trend, the managed currency system was implemented in 1935, nationalizing silver. In the five years that followed (1935-1939), the value of silver exported overseas was 806,000,000 silver dollars.

The sale of this large amount of silver eventually ended up in the hands of the U.S. Treasury. This resulted in foreign exchange reserves in U.S. dollars, which served as backing for the issuance of legal tender domestically. However, due to the purchase of military supplies and the blockade of coastal ports by the Japanese, the export trade of Free China decreased, placing a heavy burden on the foreign exchange reserves held abroad, leading to a drastic fall in the external value of the legal tender. Although British and Chinese banks jointly established a 10 million pound exchange equalization fund in Hong Kong, this fund was quickly depleted, although it was slightly replenished in mid-September 1939 due to changes in salary exchange rates. The exchange rate of Chinese legal tender against the U.S. dollar has continued to fall from its initial fixed rate of around 30 U.S. cents per yuan to its current value of only about 6 U.S. cents.

The severity of currency inflation is reflected in prices. In Shanghai, the current price of white coal per ton, calculated in Chinese currency, is eight times higher than the price in 1937, and the prices of rice and daily necessities have risen almost tenfold. The price increases in the interior are similar. According to reports, the price of coal in Chongqing is 200 yuan per ton of legal tender, and the price of rice, weighing about 133 pounds per stone, is 60 yuan in Chinese currency. Although this is a bumper year, the price has risen at least tenfold. In Free China, the prices charged for imported goods are extremely strange. In Chongqing, a 12-ounce can of butter costs 32 yuan in Chinese currency, and coffee costs 40 yuan per pound.

China's central banking system and the managed currency it adopts, using government-issued public bonds and foreign exchange from the sale of silver as collateral, are suitable for peacetime needs. However, this monetary system cannot resist the shocks of war. Therefore, the question now arises: can we still restore China's currency to a silver standard? China's previous silver reserves are in the hands of the United States and stored in the underground vaults of West Point, as everyone knows. However, under appropriate protection, returning this silver to China in the form of loans or outright gifts could stabilize its currency.

Many economists question the effectiveness of metal reserves. They acknowledge that once a country's currency is stable at a certain level, it can be maintained as long as the balance of imports and exports is maintained, without further assistance. The need for cash transfers is limited to small-scale temporary trade. Before the new financial thinking of 1935 became popular in China, we can still remember that China's currency was based on a certain amount of silver. Although the price of silver, expressed in gold, often fluctuated, the Chinese currency could generally maintain an exchange rate of around 42 U.S. cents per yuan. In the decade or so after the 1911 Revolution, China continued to experience civil wars, with cities frequently looted and partially destroyed. However, because the Chinese people have a characteristic of recovery, they could immediately restore the normal state of trade after the troops passed. Hoarded silver and bank notes backed by silver reserves reappeared from temporary hiding places, and Chinese and foreign banks in China also had large amounts of silver ingots or silver coins in their vaults as reserves for the notes they issued.

China's currency is currently in a state of disarray. Official figures released by Chongqing show that the amount of currency issued increased by 6,000,000,000 yuan in Chinese currency in the first half of 1940, and the amount of currency issued by Chinese national banks has since increased even more. In Shanghai alone, the current amount of Chinese currency in circulation is estimated to be over 7,000,000,000 yuan. However, according to reports, the total amount of currency in circulation issued under Japanese protection is no more than 1,800,000,000 Chinese yuan.

If a silver reserve is established to stabilize China's current legal tender, or if silver certificates are issued backed by silver loans promised by the U.S. Treasury, various technical difficulties may be encountered, allowing for the weakness of the French colonial government and leading to adjustments in Far Eastern relations. Therefore, although this issue is important, it should not prevent a detailed study of this possibility. However, the difficulties are certainly no greater than those arising from the conditions of the U.S. "commodity loan" of 70 million U.S. dollars. If silver certificates are issued, they will not be inconvenient silver coins, but rather in the form of warehouse receipts. Silver coins would only be in a guaranteed position.

As for the agreement that is made, it can be stipulated that the silver will be sent back to China's national territory, or a Reserve Fund can be adopted, such as the Philippine silver currency reserve fund, stored in the United States and not used for military purposes. Furthermore, Chinese and American banking groups will use their strict exchange controls to prevent silver certificates from being exchanged for foreign exchange and not used for genuine commercial transactions.

The current U.S. silver loan can greatly assist the people of China, as it can restore their purchasing power for American goods and allow them to re-establish trust in silver, which is held in the largest quantities in the world by the United States.

(Note 1) Japan is also experiencing a similar situation. Although the exchange rate of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar is artificially fixed at 23 U.S. cents per yen, the actual exchange rate has also fallen drastically.

### Seen, Heard, and Thought

When the boss received a telegram with a deadline to begin shipment of a foreign order, he hoarded his inventory and declared a shortage. The price of goods began to rise, and the inventory was gradually cleared. When the new goods arrive at the port, they can be inspected and prepared, and the order can be filled at a later date.

When the authorities intervened, the rice market became relatively calm. The rising wind in the rice market is like a fever. It is hoped that intervention will not also be like a fever. If two kinds of fever occur at the same time, then it will be like the past: all previous efforts will be wasted!

Someone said: "Everything can be hoarded, but books cannot be hoarded!"

### The Issue of Determining Currency Value

— Shen Nian

Why does the value of currency vary in quantity? In theory, there are five schools of thought, which are briefly described below:

Quantity Theory of Money

The quantity theory of money aims to study the relationship between the individual value of money and its quantity. Its argument is based on the quantitative proportion between currency and general commodities to determine the value of money and its reflected prices. That is, in the proportion between the two, if the quantity of money increases relatively, its value decreases, and commodity prices rise accordingly. If the quantity decreases relatively, its value rises, and commodity prices fall accordingly. This theory originated very early and was only noticed after a long period. The first person to explain the value of money based on the meaning of this proportional relationship and become the quantity theory of money was the Englishman Locke. Locke said: "We regard gold and silver as public certificates with imagined value to exchange other equivalent things, so gold and silver have no other value when used as currency, but only as a tool to obtain what we desire. As for gold and silver used in commerce, in fact, it is still about value, nothing else, it is just about quantity." Later, the quantity theory of money was developed by Fisher. According to Fisher's opinion, there are five elements that determine the value of money:

(A) Money in circulation

(B) Velocity of money circulation (The formula is: V is the velocity of money circulation, E is the amount of money used to purchase goods within a certain period, that is, the total consumption within one year. M is the average amount of money in circulation within one year. E divided by M is the velocity of circulation of one unit of money.)

(C) Amount of bank deposits

(D) Their velocity of movement

(E) Amount of trade

Assume that M is the amount of money in circulation, V is the velocity of money circulation, M' is the total amount of bank deposits that can be moved at any time in the form of checks, V is the velocity of circulation of bank deposits, T is the amount of trade, and P is the general level of commodity prices. Here, we can obtain the following exchange equation:

It can be seen that Fisher's argument is that money and deposit currency (M and M') both increase or decrease according to the same ratio in essence. In other words, when any of the two changes, the two will change relatively. The reason why the equation holds is that the purchase and sale of commodities in the economic society must simultaneously lead to the transfer of currency, and the amount of currency transferred must be equal to the price of the commodities bought and sold at the same time. Therefore, the left side of the equation includes the total amount of currency payments within a certain period, while the right side includes the total quantity of commodity transactions on which the currency payments are based, and the total amount of currency payments caused by it (MV) are relatively balanced, which is the meaning of the above equation. However, according to this equation, we can infer that the increase or decrease in prices and the velocity of money circulation are directly proportional, and the increase or decrease in the amount of money is inversely proportional. If other conditions remain unchanged, prices will rise or fall with the amount of money. There are two aspects to the criticism of the quantity theory of money by general scholars:

(A) Material criticism: (1) This equation overemphasizes the need for goods and does not pay attention to the supply of goods. (2) The equation neglects production costs and the quantity of goods too much. (3) This equation only recognizes the absolute change in the value of money, and ignores the relative change. The so-called absolute change is the change in commodities based on changes in money. If this theory is deduced, the quantity theory of money only takes the left side of the equation as the cause and the right side as the effect, and does not involve the fact that the right side is the cause and the left side is the effect. In fact, the two sides of this equation have a mutual relationship, in other words, it ignores costs. (4) This equation cannot express the prices generated by government control and organized consumption. (5) This equation can only represent the relationship between the value of inconvertible paper money and prices, and is not applicable to real money. Because real money is used for various purposes, even if it is minted into currency, it still has various uses. Therefore, even if the amount of money increases, it cannot affect prices, which is even more obvious. (6) This equation is too meaningless, because what it represents is only an accounting debit and credit. The left side represents debit, the right side represents credit, debit and credit are equal, what is the meaning? (7) The two sides of this equation only include currency, and do not express the real goods, and completely ignore the transaction of goods.

(B) Psychological criticism: (1) Although the right side of this equation is called monetary expenditure, the quantity of goods traded is essentially the utility of satisfying human desires. At the same time, although humans have monetary expenditures, there are no commodity income situations, which are often visible. Then the right side of this equation should be changed to the quantity of utility. (2) This equation uses mathematical methods to express the value of money and goods too objectively. According to the theory, the expression of value must be determined in a subjective way. Therefore, this equation should be subjectified to conform to the theory. (3) This equation is not really equal, because the utilities of the middle views of the buyers and sellers of goods and currency are different, which makes both sides claim that it is cheap. As a result, the buyer thinks that the left side is less than the right side, and the seller thinks that the right side is less than the left side.

The reasons held by the above two criticisms are of course very accurate, but what we should pay attention to is that neither subjective nor objective can be absolutely regarded as such, otherwise any theory will be overthrown by us. The quantity theory of money has its shortcomings, but it has truth in the long-term trend, and because it can do so, it is often praised and is the natural law for currency managers.

Quantity Theory of Coin and Goods

American scholar G. L. Langhlin refuted the inconsistency of the quantity theory of money and created the so-called quantity theory of coin and goods to replace it. He believed that the real determinants of price or currency value are four: (A) The production cost of coins or standard coins, (B) The need for coins (including the industrial need for coin materials), (C) The production cost of goods, (D) The need for goods. These four factors interact to produce the price level or the value of money. Here is the formula to show his theory.

In the above formula, M is the amount of coin, C is the production cost of the coin, D is the need for the coin, G is the amount of goods, C' is the production cost of goods, D' is the need for goods, V is the value of money, and P is the level of commodity prices. Langhlin's theory also makes sense, but since countries around the world have abandoned coins and competed to use managed currency systems, due to the improvement of credit status, part of his theory is no longer consistent with the facts. At the same time, although the theory has taken into account the need for goods, the supply side of goods is still ignored. Therefore, Langhlin's theory not only cannot overturn Fisher's theory, but also is narrower than the quantity theory of money.

Keynes's Theory of the Value of Money

This theory was created by John Maynard Keynes, so it is also called Keynes's theory of the value of money. Keynes said that the fundamental problem of the monetary principle is not to establish a static causal relationship between the quantity of money and the property it exchanges. Its real goal is to analyze the various factors contained in the important problems of money in a dynamic way, and to show the real reasons why the price level is determined and the laws of transfer from one equilibrium state to another. However, the various factors mentioned here are the production cost of goods, the production volume of goods, the price of goods, etc. Based on this theory, Keynes specially created two basic equations for the value of goods:

The reason why this equation holds is that the price of a commodity must be made up of the production cost plus profit. If W' is the average production cost of one unit of goods, Q is the profit of consumer goods, R is the amount of consumer goods and services that circulate in the market and are bought by consumers, and P is the price of consumer goods, which can be the general price (including consumer goods and production goods), then dividing Q by R will get the profit obtained from each unit of consumer goods. Adding the quotient of the two with W' will get the price level of consumer goods. P is the same again, taking Q as the profit of general goods (consumer goods and production goods), and O as the total number of goods produced, then dividing Q by O will get the profit obtained from each unit of goods, and adding it with W' will be the price level of general goods. This is the true meaning of the above two equations. From this, it can be seen that if R and O remain unchanged, then the increase or decrease of the profit Q of consumer goods and the profit Q of general goods are directly proportional, which affects the price P of consumer goods and the price of general goods.

The production costs spent by a society in producing property must be distributed to each producer, and the amount of money that the entire society receives from production is equal to the production costs that the entire society has spent, so production costs are the society's monetary income. Monetary income can be divided into two uses, one part is used for consumption, and the other part is used for savings. If it is used for consumption, it must be used to purchase consumer goods. If it is used for savings, the bank must invest it in production. If the amount of money used for consumption by the entire society exceeds the production cost of property (consumer goods), then consumer goods will get profits and their prices will rise. But on the other hand, because the amount of money used for consumption is too much, the amount of money used for savings presents a phenomenon that is less than the production cost of production goods. In theory, the price of production goods must be lower than the cost at this time, but in fact, how can merchants who own production goods be willing to sell them at a low price in view of the rise in consumer goods? At the same time, investors in production are also seeking profits in view of the same situation, so one side hoards and the other side pursues, so how can the price of production goods fall? At least its price level must be equal to the production cost. The number of investments exceeding savings is supplemented by the credit of the bank. Therefore, the profit of consumer goods can be a positive number, zero number, or negative number obtained from the production cost of production goods being greater than, equal to, or less than savings. Here is the formula to express it, and you get

I is the production cost of production goods, S is the amount of savings

The sum of the profits of general production goods and consumer goods can be determined by subtracting the savings amount from the value of production goods. If it is expressed by a formula, you get

I is the value of production goods

In short, the general price level and profit of the entire production product are based on the following four factors: (A) The size of the savings rate, (B) The size of the production cost of new investment property, (C) The public's bearish intention, (D) The size of the total amount of savings deposits. Although Keynes's theory is still opposed by some, its ability to add dynamic factors to the mechanical quantity theory of money to explain the purchasing power of money is a valuable contribution.

Marginal Utility Theory

The creator of this theory is American David Kinley, who believes that the determination of the value of money lies in the utility of the marginal unit in its transaction transfer, which is exactly equal to the utility of the last unit of the goods traded. Based on this point of view of the value of the marginal utility of money, it is inferred that the value of money in the phenomenon of transaction aggregation is often the result of the equilibrium of various forces, and the following six are the most important.

(1) The equilibrium between the cost of the coin material and its price.

(2) When the coin village is used for transactions, it is the equilibrium between the marginal utility and the marginal utility used as an ornament.

(3) The equilibrium between the marginal utility of currency for direct payment and the marginal utility of currency for reserve.

(4) The equilibrium between the marginal utility of the monetary transaction method for its society and the marginal utility of other transaction methods for the society.

(5) The equilibrium between the marginal utility of money and the marginal utility of the goods exchanged (based on a social point of view).

(6) The equilibrium between the production cost of goods and their marginal utility.

### Women's Woolen Cloth Popular Throughout Shanghai

Women's woolen cloth has been selling quite well recently. Seven or eight out of ten woolen cloth, silk, satin, and foreign goods stores sell it. This is because qipao materials have mostly favored woolen fabrics recently. Sales in this street are greater than those of customers from other places. There are many colorful women's woolen cloths such as red, yellow, blue, green, gray, purple, cyan, and dark blue displayed in the shop windows, which also shows that it is popular throughout Shanghai. Currently, because the weather is warm, thin and soft materials are selling quickly. Thick woolen women's cloths are already going out of season, so their prices have fluctuated. It has been found that most of the goods currently sold in Shanghai are made by local factories. Grade 1 sells for 25-26 yuan, Grade 2 sells for around 20 yuan, Grade 3 sells for 15-16 yuan, and Grade 4 sells for 11-12 yuan.

### Sugar Prices Slightly Rebound

Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded by a few cents. The association drew a board, and the spot price of No. 24 coarse white sugar was 82 yuan at this store. The futures price for settlement on the 20th of this month was 81.4-81.5 or 81.7 yuan, settlement at the end of the month was 81.8-82.1 or 82.2 yuan, up a small 3 cents. Taikoo car white B mark was 82.3-82.4 yuan at Xizhan, up a small 1 cent. HX mark was 78.2 yuan, up 2 cents. H mark car red was 61 yuan at Xizhan, and Dutch red was 64 yuan, no change.

### Tea Talks in Economics

— Feng Liutang

The weather has been mild and sunny for days, a fine time for plants and trees to bud and sprout, and also the season for harvesting China's famous tea leaves.

The discovery of Chinese tea is very ancient. The Book of Poetry says, "Who says bitter tea is sweet like candy?" "Tu" in ancient times was the same as "tea," meaning the older tea leaves, which taste bitter and astringent when first tasted, but have a clear, fragrant, and sweet aftertaste. "Sweet like candy" refers to its delicious taste, as the proverb says, "Country people eat olives, throwing them away and picking them up again," which can be used as an annotation for "bitter tea like candy."

Tea was taxed starting in the Tang Dynasty, indicating that tea consumption among the people was already high at that time, hence it was coveted by tax officials. After Lu Yu's "The Classic of Tea" was written, tea began to be praised by literati. However, this does not mean that Lu Yu discovered tea; rather, Lu Yu was the first to write about tea. Later works on tea include "Tea Narrative," "Tea Manual," "Records of Yihé Northern Garden Tribute Tea," and "Northern Garden Special Records," among others.

Tea is classified into "Mingqian" (pre-Qingming) and "Yuqian" (pre-Grain Rain) based on the time of picking. In fact, it is the same tea, only picked at different times! "Mingqian" refers to tea picked before Qingming Festival, also known as "Huoqian" (before the fire). "Yuqian" refers to tea picked before Grain Rain. In reality, it's all about the tenderness of the leaves or the number of buds! Because tender tea leaves are not only visually appealing in their yellow-green color but also have a clear, fragrant, and harmonious taste; the larger the leaves, the more astringent the taste and the darker the color, causing a tingling sensation when drunk. Therefore, buds are considered superior, and leaves are ranked lower. Before Qingming, new tea buds have just sprouted, so buds are precious. Before Grain Rain, buds have unfolded into leaves, which are not as good as buds, but are still tender leaves. Tea picked after Grain Rain has increasingly old leaves and an increasingly inferior taste, which is what is commonly called coarse tea.

The quality of tea is determined by its buds and leaves. The following is an excerpt from Song Xiong Fan's "Records of Xuanhe Northern Garden Tribute Tea" to show what is still in circulation today.

Song Xiong Fan's "Records of Xuanhe Northern Garden Tribute Tea" says: "There are several grades of tea buds. The highest grade is small buds like eagle tongues and sparrow claws, which are straight and strong, hence called bud tea. Next is 'Jian Ya' (selected buds), which are one bud and one leaf, called 'one spear and one flag.' Next is 'Zhong Ya' (middle buds), which are one bud with two leaves, called 'one spear and two flags.' Those with three or four leaves are gradually becoming old. The reason is that tea buds that have not yet unfolded are like spears, and those that have unfolded are like flags. In the Gengzi year of Yihé, the transport minister Zheng Kewen first created 'Silver Thread Water Buds,' which were to select the mature buds, remove them again, and only take a strand of the core, store it in a precious container soaked in clear spring water, bright and clean like silver thread, to make a new square pound with a small dragon winding on it, called 'Dragon Ball Superior to Snow.'

### New Uses of Vitamins

— Yong

As people get older, the most obvious phenomenon is that the hair on their heads gradually turns from black to gray. Recently, two foreign doctors discovered that a certain vitamin, when mixed with several minerals, can prevent this phenomenon and even restore gray hair to its original black color. If vitamins truly have this new use, we should certainly have more faith in the delusion of "returning to youth"!

These two doctors, one named Dr. Claus Vuna, and the other named Dr. Alfred H. Free, both used rats as test subjects. The former fed young rats a fixed amount of pantothenic acid and a mixed feed of a vitamin every day. As a result, the rats never turned gray, and those that had already turned gray could restore their original color. The latter used a method that was not much different, but the feed was extracted from vitamins and filled with manganese and iron and other ingredients, and the result was the same. Because, according to biology, rats and humans belong to the same species, their conclusion is that this test can also be applied to humans. However, because no formal human trials have been conducted, they are still in doubt.

There was once a middle-aged woman who was very weak. Since listening to the doctor's advice to eat more foods rich in vitamin B, not only was her body no longer as weak as before, but her hair did not turn gray with age. This example can help explain that certain vitamins do indeed have the new uses mentioned above. However, a question arises: why do some people who pay attention to getting vitamins in their diet every day still have gray hair when they get old? I am afraid we still need to ask experts to answer.

### Leather Shoes and Cloth Shoes

— Zhang Mengzhao

Walking more and taking the bus less is certainly good for strengthening muscles and bones and saving money on fares, but shoes are easily damaged and uneconomical. This is undeniable. There are always advantages and disadvantages to everything. In order to save on bus fares, I go out at sunrise and return at sunset, walking to work every day. Although the road is long (I live on Putuo Road in western Shanghai), I don't find it difficult. The rhythm of jazz music (radio) in the city adds to my interest and energy as I walk. The only loss is a pair of cloth shoes, which used to last for half a year but now only last for three or four months because I have to walk more. Today, a pair of cloth shoes (straight tribute twill or broadcloth with chicken skin soles) costs at least seven or eight yuan, unlike the previous one or two yuan. If I have to change a pair every three months, I need four pairs of shoes a year, which costs nearly thirty yuan. Although this is still three-quarters less than the cost of bus fares (taking the bus costs at least ten yuan per month, or one hundred and twenty yuan per year. If you wear four pairs of shoes a year, isn't it only a quarter of the bus fare, saving three-quarters of the money?), I still think it is too wasteful. I came up with a plan, changed my strategy, and used the money to buy four pairs of straight tribute twill shoes to buy a pair of small leather shoes for seventeen or eight yuan, planning to wear them for a year. I save another twelve or thirteen yuan a year. Isn't this an economic calculation that goes one step further? Although the soles of socks are also easy to break, it doesn't matter if you mend them or use coarse cloth soles. The sound of shoes is more pleasant when walking. The only thing to fear in the world is not using your brain. If you use your brain to think of ways, "difficult" is actually "easy," so why wouldn't everyone be happy to do it?

### Talking About Pearl Rice

— Qiusheng

Corn has always been one of the staple foods for the poor in our country. The method of eating it is mostly to grind the corn into碎粒 (broken grains), mix it with rice, and cook it into porridge or rice. The taste is still palatable, but slightly sweeter than rice! It is very rich in starch and is an important raw material for manufacturing starch. Therefore, in terms of nutrition, it may not be inferior to broken rice or rotten rice. In the previous issue of this journal, Mr. Qiulang agreed: "If you can't afford rice, switch to corn." I think that in this period of expensive rice and difficult living, this is worth implementing. Because there are some discrepancies with the facts in Mr. Qiulang's work, it has caused me to eat碎米饭 (broken rice) and talk about pearl rice.

Mr. Qiulang said: "Corn is also known as bagu, also known as Yushu Shu, also known as Lu Su, ... The so-called 'Shu Shu' and 'Yu Shu Shu', according to the theory of Ben Cao, is probably 'Ben Lu Su' and 'Yang Lu Su', ..." Under the "probably," Mr. Qiulang is wrong. 玉蜀黍 (Corn), 蜀黍 (Sorghum), 蘆粟 (Sweet Sorghum) all belong to the Gramineae family, but each has its own object, and 蘆粟 (Sweet Sorghum) has no distinction between "Ben" and "Yang". Now I will describe these three objects separately:

玉米 (Corn), the male flowers are gathered at the top of the stem, the female flowers are born in the axils of the leaves in the middle of the stem, and the base of the flower axis has several large bracts, which surround the entire flower axis, so 玉米 (Corn) is also known as 苞米 (Corn on the cob), 包穀 (Corn). Also, because 玉米 (Corn) is smooth like pearls, so we Shanghai people call it 珍珠米 (Pearl Rice). The Ben Cao says: "Like a zongzi fish shape, ... After a long time, the bracts split and the seeds come out, clustered in grains", which is the 玉米 (Corn) grown after the female flowers are fertilized, for us to eat. Also, due to the different dialects in each place, 玉米 (Corn) also has the names 玉米 (Corn), 玉麥 (Corn), 番麥 (Corn), 玉蜀秫 (Corn), 戒菽 (Corn), etc.

蜀黍 (Sorghum), flowers in summer at the top of the stem, flower shape is similar to粟 (millet), after flowering, it bears fruit, reddish-brown in color, shiny, and the top of the shell has short awns. After the fruit matures, the shell slightly splits open. After removing the shell, it can be used for food. Commonly known as 高粱 (Sorghum), the very famous 高粱酒 (Sorghum liquor) is made from 蜀黍 (Sorghum). 蜀黍 (Sorghum) can also be used to extract alcohol.

蘆粟 (Sweet Sorghum) has a shape very similar to 蜀黍 (Sorghum), but the stem is slightly taller than 蜀黍 (Sorghum). The fruit that grows at the top of the stem cannot be used for food, we only eat the juice in its stem. Its stem contains a lot of very sweet juice. It is produced in large quantities in Pudong, Chongming, etc. In recent years, various parts of the United States have been testing it for use as a raw material for sugar production.

### Strange Roads

— Reuters

People living in the countryside, most of their lives stepping on rugged dirt roads, once they step on smooth slate or stone roads in the county town, they feel unusually comfortable. But people living as recluses on isolated islands still find it difficult to walk on asphalt roads and use trams and cars for transportation. If that country person stepped on Shanghai's asphalt road, it must be regarded as the paradise of Kangzhuang Avenue. But strange things in the world are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. Speaking of the strangeness of roads, it is really hard to believe, it seems like a strange dream.

On a road in southern Africa, it is built with light blue soil, but studded with shining diamonds, large and small, the large ones are as big as coconuts. The value of the entire road is up to 500 million US dollars. This is the most valuable road in the world. If it is moved to an isolated island, there may be a big fight between people, because everyone will go to grab the diamonds! It is even more peculiar to count the roads paved with gems and jasper in Soviet Russia, and the colors of the gems are various, reflecting each other in the sunlight. What a magnificent and luxurious road this is. And the most peculiar road is in India at the southern end of Asia. That area is a tropical sugar production area, so a large amount of waste from the sugar factory is used as a material for building roads, mixing it with water, heating it, and paving it on the roadbed, and covering it with coarse sand on top. It solidifies into a sugar slag road when it gets cold. The decision is that the state of Southern California in America夹 (sandwiches) the net woven from cotton yarn in the middle of two layers of asphalt, like a sandwich cookie, but its firmness is comparable to steel-bone cement. This road can be called a cotton yarn road. There are also roads paved with the胶质 (gelatinous) waste from rayon factories mixed with mud, sand, and stones. The various roads listed above can be regarded as extremely strange in our eyes, but the local people take it for granted, because the materials for building roads are different depending on the situation in each place. If that place is rich in a certain item that can be used to build roads, it is used as a material for building roads.

### A Week's Home Cooking Menu

— Ms. Huaying

Recently, a lot of cauliflower has been found in the larger vegetable markets. This is also a kind of vegetable rich in vitamins, and the price ranges from two cents to six cents depending on the size. As for how to make it, it is most suitable to make it as a meat dish. For example, Ming shrimp, which are now also available in large quantities in small vegetable markets, can be bought for four to six yuan. If you cut them into sections and braise them alone, it may not be enough to eat for two bowls day and night, so it is best to cut them into slices, add a little lard and water chestnut flour, and stir-fry them with cauliflower and bamboo shoot slices, which is very delicious. If you don't use Ming shrimp, then replace them with chicken giblets or meat slices. For vegetarian dishes, you can stir-fry cauliflower with winter mushrooms and bamboo shoot slices, or add them to vegetarian ten-scenery, which is also possible.

### The Solemn Sadness of Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Wang Yizhi, sent from the Netherlands

— Commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the passing of Mao Yi —

1. Immediately record clothing, to chant the autumn colors: The dawn light on the continuous mountains is beautiful with flying flags, the official horse and military uniform are walking in the painting, tears fall and the rooster crows, the intestines are broken, the initial journey is recorded on the road to Qiannan.

Ganzhou was anciently called Qianzhou. Thirty-three years ago, in late autumn, classmate Hu Zhixiang (Shaoqi)'s father, Magistrate Lianzhai, went south to take office. I was appointed as the principal of Anyuan School and also served as the instructor of the Yuan soldiers. I rode my horse to follow him. Every time I heard the desolate rooster in the inn, the joy was incredible. This rooster crow, however, could not be heard after the passing of Lian Zhang's daughter, Mao Yi. At 6:00 a.m. on November 11, 1918, the sky was half-bright. I was walking from the center of Washington, D.C., back to 19th Street in the northwest. In the distance, a loud voice shouted, "Extra!" The neighbor's rooster crowed three times, and all sounds were cleared. Recalling the past ten years, gatherings and dispersals, glory and decay, were like a dream. Tears suddenly burst out, and I suddenly didn't know where the sadness came from. My clan's Yangming's rooster crowing poem has the line "Turning my head for more than thirty years, I don't say that it has been consumed by only a few sounds." Alas, the same sound, heard in a different place, the feelings are so touching.

2. Record food after the robbery, to chant the autumn heart: Fate and human affairs are both missed, wheat and butter are wasted, the life-sustaining soup is lost at hand, and there are many scars on the cliff-like heart.

Mao Yi was sick in a foreign land, and there were no relatives by her side. She couldn't even drink a cup of Chinese tea. At that time, I was also confined to a hospital in Washington, D.C., unable to help. My heart was pounding and burning. Moreover, I received Mao's letter on October 8 and went to Mao's bedside on the 13th. She was urgently seeking malt extract milk powder or beef juice to maintain her fleeting physical resistance.

Spring and Autumn

### Propaganda

— Xu Daming

Propaganda, by its very nature, has a "one-sided" nature.

The love news of movie star Lu Ming, Li Qinian suddenly had a "father," these are said to be for "propaganda." What is unlucky is the star's worth, status, and credibility. However, in the eyes of the company's bosses, as long as I have money to make and wealth to generate, the star's credibility, status, etc. have nothing to do with him. Fortunately, the ability and tools for this kind of propaganda are all in the hands of the boss. It is effortless to 区区 "propaganda news." Otherwise, even this bit of prestige cannot be displayed, and it would be truly 寃枉 (wrongly accused) to be the boss!

Therefore, all the propaganda advertisements in the newspaper have to be "looked at differently," otherwise, you will hum and be deceived!

Recently, this kind of propaganda seems to have lost its effect. Therefore, the policy of "winning the mind is the best" is adopted: there is no rice; coal is about to run out; but it is impossible to publish "advertisements" or publish "propaganda publications" like "father" and "lover." Therefore, pretending to be stupid, they publish "talks." Therefore, it seems that the food supply will be cut off tomorrow, or they will be working in the dark. Everyone is in a panic. However, the "propaganda" of the "speculators" has taken effect. He is smiling triumphantly:

"You have been fooled by me again haha!"

### Sister-in-law Decai

— Zhuang Ling

— One of the "Bad Land" Sketches —

The five-branch light bulb was swayed by the wind coming in through the window seams. The shadows in the small room also trembled. Sister-in-law Decai's shadow was also like her heart - trembling very violently. A smile appeared on her excited and flushed face from time to time. Happy illusions surrounded her heavily. All the oppressed grievances and past disappointments disappeared in the smile. Indeed, based on the past few experiences, it has never been as spiritual as today. Not biased, not oblique, pointing directly at the "Tai" character of "Taiping."

"If it really hits," she thought, "three times five is fifteen, after deducting expenses, there will always be one hundred and thirty or forty yuan. That will not only break even, but also have a surplus, ..."

"Mom! It hurts!" A burst of crying broke her dream. She woke up in surprise. Three-year-old Abao turned over in bed, rubbing her little hands against each other. There was some redness and swelling on the back of her hands. Her heart ached for a while. Sister-in-law Decai sighed heavily:

"Alas! Poor thing!"

She walked over gently and sat on the bed, patting Abao while humming a lullaby unintentionally:

"Baby, don't cry! If you win tomorrow, I'll buy you a cake!"

Abao fell asleep, and the air was quiet again. The wind outside the window was still roaring. Occasionally, a burst of noise from the lottery stall was carried into her ears by the wind. Although this sound was an annoying feeling, to Sister-in-law Decai, it was like a magnet, attracting all of her attention.

"Should it be 'open'?"

She lowered her head, and her eyes again touched those red and swollen little hands, red and a little blue, swollen like steamed buns, and still rubbing against each other. Tears of a mother dripped down.

This was what happened this afternoon. She believed the neighbor's words, wrote the names of all thirty-six doors on a piece of yellow paper, lit incense candles, got her daughter drunk with wine (because she was a "virgin"), held her and knelt on the stool in the middle, and then kowtowed three times, praying in a low voice to her own daughter. Because of the power of the wine, Abao gradually closed her eyes and lowered her head.

"Good! The spirit has entered!" Sister-in-law Decai's joy came from the bottom of her heart. She kept kowtowing, even prostrating on the ground.

"Wah! ——" The "Bodhisattva" on the table cried. She stood up in panic. Abao was already asleep on the table. I don't know how one of her hands got into the incense burner, and the back of her hand immediately became red and swollen.

After taking Abao down, Sister-in-law Decai was both surprised and delighted, because the yellow paper had already been marked with a point of vermilion pen in Abao's hand, right on the "Tai" character of "Taiping."

She rummaged through her box and took out a red cotton-padded jacket from when she got married, wrapped it in a package, and carried Abao out the door.

Half an hour later, she gave the neighbor five yuan and asked him to "seal the package."

A burst of noise again restored Sister-in-law Decai's consciousness from her memories.

"It's open!"

Her mood immediately became tense, her heart was beating as if it were about to break through her chest cavity. She widened her eyes and clenched her fists. At this moment, an arrow pierced her heart. ——

"Luo only got!"

Sister-in-law Decai fainted on the bed, as if falling into an abyss of ten thousand feet. Before her eyes was an endless darkness. In this darkness, she seemed to see several huge devil's hands gradually surrounding her. In her ears, she heard Abao's crying and the neighbor's shouting:

"Sister-in-law Decai ate "Shao Bao!"

The newspaper reported that a certain company was holding a special sale.

I had nothing to do today, so I took this opportunity to run to the company. As soon as I entered the company, I saw the place with the special price tag, the crowd was so crowded that water could not leak, and they were vying to buy biscuits. I ran closer and took a look, which surprised me. It turned out that today's special price was the same as the selling price two days ago. I asked the staff, and I learned that after the special price period expires, the selling price will rise again.

(5) The Dividing Line Between Love and Desire

"I'm afraid it's too little and I can't get it out!" Zhao Si muttered, then moved his short, fat legs, ready to go downstairs.

Xiao Rongkui, who was dreaming of foreign money all day long, suddenly jumped up the stairs in three steps and two steps, almost knocking Zhao Si down. "You have to come back quickly!" Qiu Haitang said, looking at Zhao Si's back, "Ji Zhaoxiong from Yuan's mansion will come to us later, and you must send him away."

"He just wants your money!" Zhao Si said pointedly. After a while, his gourd-like figure disappeared outside the curtain.

Rongkui saw Zhao Si leave, immediately straightened his waist, showing that he was ready to fight, and said:

"Boss, you don't have to be afraid of those hooligans anymore! If they dare to come here to make trouble again, it would be strange if they don't get slapped a few times!"

Qiu Haitang looked at his fellow, who was usually as timid as a mouse, suddenly changing his temperament so much. She really didn't understand what was going on. She couldn't help but look back at the calendar hanging on the wall, wondering what day it was today that would make this little mouse so imposing.

"Not long after you went out, the headquarters sent a brother, and when there were a few hooligans making trouble here, they just shouted at them, and they all ran away like little ghosts seeing Yama."

What Rongkui said made Qiu Haitang realize that he was still "relying on the power of others." She couldn't help but give him a very contemptuous smile. However, in any case, she could already know from his report that Luo Zhouqi had indeed done his best for her.

"Maybe the second boss is back too?" Qiu Haitang suspected that Zhao Yukun was a little embarrassed after coming back, so he was hiding in the room and didn't come out.

"That's not true."

"Huh!" He remembered that Xiangqi told him that Governor Hu had sent someone to bring Yukun out this afternoon. Why hadn't he come back yet? He thought there shouldn't be any problems, right?

In Rongkui's heart, he couldn't wait for Zhao Yukun to be in the police station for a few more days. The hatred from last year still had some sour taste on his tongue! (56)
