### The Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee Concludes Successfully; Many Important Resolutions Passed During the Session

President Chiang Delivers Instructions, Encouraging Comrades to Temper Themselves and Strive Forward, Emphasizing Economic Construction to Complete the Great Rejuvenation

Chongqing The Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee concluded yesterday. The number of Central Committee members attending this session was unprecedented in previous plenary sessions. (Havas dispatch on the 1st)

Chongqing At the opening of the Eighth Plenary Session, President Chiang delivered an address, stating that the half-year period from the closing of the Tenth Plenary Session to the end of last year was the most perilous period for the Party and the nation in the revolutionary process. It was no easy feat for the Party and the nation to weather this period safely. He often said that revolution is not afraid of danger or difficulty. If Party comrades can lead the people of the country, united and striving together, then no danger or difficulty cannot be overcome. This is evidenced by the Party's past history, as each danger has resulted in progress and success, and the greater the difficulty, the greater the success. As long as we work hard, the most dangerous time will be the time when success is achieved. More than eight months ago, the war environment was very bleak. Now, all comrades and people of the country witness military consolidation and diplomatic openness, and believe that the crisis has passed. However, it is necessary to know that although the crisis has passed, there should be no slightest negligence or slackness. We must rely on past experiences and lessons, and strive harder, without avoiding sacrifice, overcoming difficulties to fulfill our responsibilities. This plenary session shoulders the important task of building on the past and opening up the future. We must thoroughly review, sincerely reflect, and correct past mistakes. Only then can the War of Resistance be victorious and the revolution be successful. At the same time, we must conduct detailed research on the implementation of our ideology, national construction, and domestic and foreign policies, and establish concrete plans that can be effectively implemented after the session to accelerate the arrival of victory.

President Chiang's Instructions Emphasize Economic Issues

Chongqing In his instructions at the opening of the Eighth Plenary Session on March 24th, President Chiang emphasized economic issues and the close relationship between the Kuomintang and the people. All Chinese newspapers today published the full text of his speech, in which he stated that the military crisis of the Sino-Japanese War has now passed, and warned the Kuomintang that the nation as a whole still has serious difficulties to overcome. He also said that economic issues are extremely important. In today's War of Resistance, military importance accounts for only 30%, while economic importance accounts for 70%. It is reported that a total of 250 committee members, with 159 attending this session. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)

Chongqing Today, Chinese and foreign observers praised President Chiang's speech on March 24th, saying that it was frank and outspoken, and that he was able to criticize the Kuomintang's shortcomings, failures, and mistakes that the public cannot discuss. Observers here believe that Chiang's criticism of the Kuomintang's slack work and his statement that "we are corrupt and backward, we should admit and accept this criticism, and from today onwards, we should thoroughly review our past mistakes and shortcomings and correct them" is a clear demonstration of Chiang's frankness. Observers also said that President Chiang advocated that China should have new facilities in politics, and that the Kuomintang should not be rectified before the implementation of the new policies, which may enable the government to deal with important issues. It is believed that from Chiang's extreme emphasis on the economic situation, the trend of government policies can be foreseen. Regarding this point, it is reported that the Central Executive Committee has discussed initiating a comprehensive three-year plan, which will include many aspects of activity, with special emphasis on economic and financial activities. (Associated Press dispatch on the 1st)

Whether in Politics or Military Affairs, the Future is Optimistic

Chongqing Various observers here recently commented on the Chinese political situation, saying that the future is optimistic whether in politics or military affairs. First, in terms of politics, the only problem is the friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. However, this friction has been going on for a long time. In the past, the Communist Party used the same cover to expand its sphere of influence from the north bank of the Yellow River to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, resulting in the so-called "New Fourth Army" incident. However, based on the following reasons, sources believe that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will not openly break up: (1) The Soviet Union continues to provide financial and military assistance to China. This policy is not only sufficient to influence the attitude of the Third International, but also indirectly affect the Communist Party's position. (2) There is a large disparity in strength between the Central Army and the Communist Army. Although the Communist Army claims to have 500,000 personnel, its equipment is far inferior to that of the Central Army, and the number of personnel is at least one to five. (3) The leaders of the Communist Party do not agree with each other. Second, in terms of military affairs, it is generally believed that the Japanese army has reached the end of its strength. Since the defeat in southern Henan, the Japanese army has repeatedly been defeated in western Yichang and northern Jiangxi. Its morale has obviously been hit. Looking back from October last year to the end of March this year, the Chinese army has won many major victories. The major ones include: (1) In October last year, the Chinese army recovered the Madang Fortress in the lower reaches of Jiujiang. (2) In October last year, the Japanese army launched an offensive in the border area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, which failed and lost 10,000 personnel. (3) The Japanese army abandoned Nanning and Longzhou in Guangxi Province. (4) In November last year, the Japanese army mobilized five divisions to attack the Han River basin in central Hubei, which was ineffective. After two weeks of fierce fighting, it was finally defeated by the Chinese army and suffered heavy losses. (5) From January to February this year, 100,000 Japanese troops launched an offensive in southern Henan, resulting in a loss of 20%. (6) In the recent battle in northern Jiangxi, the Japanese army suffered 20,000 casualties. In short, while the Japanese side is determined to advance southward, it cannot dispatch new troops to China for reinforcement. Therefore, it may not be able to launch larger-scale battles in China in the future. (Havas dispatch on the 1st)

### The Japanese Army Suffers Losses in the Western Sui Campaign

A certain place in western Sui After the Chinese army on the right bank of the Yellow River south of Baotou successively recovered places such as Cha Deng Zhao and Seng Gao Yidan, it engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in Lang Erpan for several days. On the 28th, it captured the area. Subsequently, the Japanese army reinforced from Zhao Junjin to Dao Qianhan Song in an attempt to counterattack, but was ambushed by the Chinese army. The Japanese army retreated along the original route. On the 28th, the Japanese army on the right wing crossed the river again to invade the Baigui area, coordinating with the Japanese army besieged in the Dashuwan area.

### The Full Text of President Chiang's Instructions at the Eighth Plenary Session

Chongqing The full text of President Chiang's instructions at the Eighth Plenary Session is as follows:

Fellow comrades, today is the opening of the Eighth Plenary Session. It has been eight months since the closing of the Seventh Plenary Session. From the last Plenary Session to the end of last year, this half-year period was the most dangerous and difficult period for our Party and our nation in the revolutionary process. As we look back today, it was not easy for our Party and our nation to safely overcome this danger. This time, many of you comrades, especially those who have come from afar, and many comrades who have been separated for one or two years, are able to gather in the provisional capital and meet together to brainstorm and discuss the various tasks of Party affairs, politics, economics, and society in the future, and I am sure that everyone will feel very happy and excited. I often say that our revolution is not afraid of danger or difficulty. This is evidenced by the past history of our Party. Every time we experience danger and difficulty, we gain more progress and success, and the greater the difficulty, the greater the success. As long as we can work hard, the most dangerous time is the time when we want to achieve success. Looking back at the situation more than eight months ago, our environment at that time seemed very bleak, but now the situation is becoming clearer day by day. I want to tell you all that our greatest crisis has indeed passed, but there is still danger in the future, and we must not have any negligence or slackness. Therefore, after overcoming a difficult situation, we must rely on past experiences and lessons, and work harder and harder to fulfill our responsibilities, and we must not forget danger in times of peace, so that we can overcome any difficulties and dangers. How can we painfully reflect on ourselves and urge ourselves to turn our country from danger to safety and to turn defeat into victory? This is the responsibility that our Eighth Plenary Session should take up, and our task has become even heavier because of this, so we must work diligently to achieve the final success. Observing the current situation of our Party, not only the people and public opinion have many criticisms of us, but we ourselves also realize that we have many shortcomings and mistakes. It is undeniable that many comrades are perfunctory and negligent, and have forgotten the current difficulties and dangers. Since the plenary session is responsible for building on the past and opening up the future, the first thing to do is to thoroughly reflect on our past shortcomings and mistakes. Why do the people doubt us? Why do we attract all kinds of criticism and ridicule? Where is the cause? From the Party headquarters itself to the individual Party members, everyone must thoroughly review and sincerely reflect, and completely wash away our past shortcomings and mistakes. Only then will our revolutionary future have hope, and the great cause of the War of Resistance can succeed. It is even more necessary to know that the opening of this plenary session is at the most critical juncture of our War of Resistance. It is not only to turn the Party and the country from danger to safety and to turn defeat into victory, and to establish the foundation of our self-reliance, but also to bear our responsibility for the safety of the current world situation. Therefore, we must thoroughly review the various problems of Party affairs, politics, military affairs, economics, and society, and conduct detailed research on the Party's domestic and foreign policies, and establish concrete resolutions so that they can be effectively implemented after the plenary session. The hard struggle of the military and civilians for the past three years and eight months, we can say that the military crisis has passed and has achieved considerable success. However, our past achievements have various important factors, and it can be said that the vast majority rely on the power of ideology and spirit. If we talk about the military itself, if we want to be able to compete with the world powers, and to be able to make our international strength truly sufficient to defend ourselves after the War of Resistance, then our Party comrades must add a hundred times more effort to achieve the goal. Therefore, although we are optimistic about the military situation, we must never have the slightest slackness, and we must not be satisfied with our ability to fight a protracted war. In the future, military and economic affairs should be equally important, and in terms of the characteristics of modern warfare, we should say that the decision of future success or failure depends on the economy accounting for 70% and the military accounting for only 30%. Our comrades at the plenary session must recognize this significance, and attach as much importance to economic measures in the future as we did to military affairs in the past three years, and work as hard. I can say that we have established an invincible position in the military situation, and the key to future victory or defeat will largely depend on the economy. Especially today, you who are attending the plenary session have the responsibility to lead the comrades of the whole Party and the compatriots of the whole country, and you must know that the economy is as important as the military. Whether it is military or civilian compatriots, whether it is in the front or the rear, everyone can do their best, and the scope of the economy is more extensive than military history, and its promotion is easier. As long as we can avoid the past accumulation of negative perfunctoriness and negligence, and carry forward the spirit of hard work, hard work, and active struggle, and work together, then with China's unique economic foundation, I believe that no matter what difficulties can be broken, and the final success can be achieved. On the contrary, if we are perfunctory and negligent, afraid of difficulties and stealing safety, and cannot work hard and honestly, and cannot help each other and cooperate, then no matter how superior our conditions are, they will be useless, and once we fail, the degree of danger will be more serious than military failure.

Editorial

### The Difficulties of the So-Called New Order in Europe

The sudden change in Yugoslavia seems to have poured cold water on the lavish banquet held by Germany and Italy to entertain their eastern guests, posing a difficult question in their faces. Originally, this was not the only difficulty encountered in the process of creating their so-called new order; but to date, the difficulties have been enumerated, all of which urgently need to be resolved, but none have been resolved yet. Let us examine them one by one as follows.

First, the war against Greece - when Italy launched the offensive against Greece at the end of October last year, it estimated (1) that Greece would have absolutely no courage or strength to resist, and (2) that Britain would have no determination or actual preparation to aid Greece. But the facts answered that not only did Greece resist fully, but Britain's thorough military preparations and swift actions were both beyond Italy's expectations. Greece was not only able to defend itself, but also to take the offensive; Britain's ships and aircraft arrived in an instant, and its army also landed in Greece and guarded the port. For five months, the continuous victories of Britain and Greece have almost shaken the foundation of the Italian Empire; the outward expansion of the Axis powers has been transformed into Italy as the target, suffering severe pain. From then on, if Greece continues its operational advantage for one day, Italy's left wing will be under serious threat for one day. Moreover, Britain has already merged with Greece in this regard and become a unit. The problem encountered by the Axis is no longer to reverse the decline and defeat Greece. This is indeed their serious difficulty, which constitutes the greatest source of their deep anxiety.

Second, the apprehension about the Soviet Union - The Soviet Union's congratulatory telegram to the Yugoslav government after the coup in Yugoslavia, compared to the statement issued after Bulgaria's participation in the "new order," which acknowledged prior consultation, was more positive, which made Germany and Italy gasp. As early as November last year, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov visited Berlin in return. At that time, the scope of the German-Soviet negotiations was of course very broad. It is said that regarding the political part, Germany proposed to follow the precedent of partitioning Poland and divide the Balkans and Turkey with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union refused. This was an important failure of the so-called new order to build a new order without bloodshed, but fortunately it was a failure that was not blatant. However, Germany concentrated a large army in the area bordering the Soviet Union shortly thereafter; and the Soviet Union also made large-scale military deployments in the Baltic countries, within Poland, and in the Ukraine. From that time to the statement for Bulgaria and the telegram to Yugoslavia, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's firm attitude in the Balkans is something that Germany and Italy cannot reverse. But after this Yugoslav change, Germany did not immediately fly into a rage, but advocated in a civilized manner that the treaty signed by the former Yugoslav authorities should still be valid. This legalistic view and scholarly tone are very different from the style of the Führer Hitler. Undoubtedly, the key lies in the Soviet Union.

Third, relations with France and Spain - In November last year, Germany and Italy were once active towards France and Spain; at that time, their wishes for France were (1) the transfer of the navy to Germany and Italy, and (2) the emphasis on participating in the anti-British campaign. What they hoped for from Spain was to formally join the so-called "new order," and to immediately demand the return of Gibraltar from Britain as its positive action. If France and Spain had accepted the German and Italian proposals at that time, the reactions that would have been caused in other aspects would have been complicated, profound, and subtle, which would have been difficult to imagine. However, on the British side, attention would have been disturbed, forces would have been dispersed, and the situation would have been more difficult. On the Italian side, on the contrary, the pressure would have been reduced, the crisis would have disappeared, and the Greek problem would no longer be a problem or would have been solved easily. However, the result of the negotiations with France only triggered a wave of internal political nature in France; the possible cause and effect thereafter, whether it is beneficial or harmful to Germany and France, is really unknown. The result of the negotiations with Spain was only that both sides were silent and retreated, and there was no further development and no agreement may have been reached! On the contrary, we have seen one after another: the United States is happy to mediate between Britain and France on the dispute over food and blockade; French President Marshal Pétain officially notified Britain that he would not allow foreign troops to pass through the free zone of France and would not allow French warships to accept foreign transfers, and not only the French naval base would be provided for unlimited use by foreign countries; the defeatist Laval, although he had backers, finally resigned; French Governor-General of Africa Weygand decided, along with other French governors in various regions, and powerful figures such as Admiral Darlan, reiterated their support for Pétain's position. Under this situation, if Germany and Italy were to force too much, it would be tantamount to driving them closer to the de Gaulle faction and eventually merging. Hitler could only endure this and wait for another opportunity; but whether the Axis goes east or south, it must first arrange France and Spain properly.

Fourth, the attempts on Turkey - Germany, being dissatisfied with the Soviet Union, directly threatened and enticed Turkey, but it also failed. Germany's efforts to dismantle the Anglo-Turkish alliance instead promoted its closeness; and the sudden publication of the Soviet-Turkish declaration gave the Axis powers a head-on blow in their eastward advance. Since Germany failed to divide Turkey with the Soviet Union, Turkey occupies a pivotal position whether the Axis advances eastward in the future or resolves the current Balkan problem. Since the change in Yugoslavia, the atmosphere of an alliance between Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia has immediately thickened. British Foreign Secretary Eden's sudden return to the Balkans now is obviously to form a front against the Axis. Whether Germany and Italy can save the decline in this regard largely depends on the hopeless negotiations with Turkey.

Fifth, the Bulgaria and Yugoslavia problem - Although Bulgaria is already under German occupation, Germany's foothold is not stable; although Yugoslavia signed a document, it finally broke out of the cage. Under the complex evolution of the Balkan situation, it is very questionable whether Germany can control Bulgaria for a long time. Yugoslavia's sudden rise to self-reliance and striving to improve is certainly difficult for Germany and Italy to win over and seize by force. So far, they are still helpless.

With the alliance of Britain and the United States standing against the Axis on the front and these difficulties under the elbow, the prospect of establishing a European "new order" is dimming day by day.

### Burmese Government and China Strengthen Transportation Institutions; Two Countries Discuss Improvement Plans for Highways; Recognize the Immediacy of Railroad Construction; Communiqué of the Burmese Delegation Working in Chongqing

Rangoon: The Burmese government recently issued a lengthy communiqué regarding the work of the Burmese delegation in Chongqing last month. It stated that the delegation's main purpose was to discuss highway projects and transportation along those highways between the two countries, as well as the fees to be levied on goods transported between the two countries. It is now prepared to discuss other issues within the Burmese government's purview with the Chinese government.

Compensating for Shortcomings, Regulating Transportation

Regarding highway projects, the delegation listened carefully to the Chinese government's opinions on improvements, which they all deemed necessary. They also explained to the Chinese government the steps Burma has taken to compensate for obvious shortcomings. The issue of regulating transportation is particularly important due to the exorbitant transportation fees charged by carriers for personal gain. The Chinese government resolved to prohibit commercial transportation on the Chinese section in December of last year. To address these difficulties and prevent significant losses to Burma, the Burmese government implemented fixed freight rates in Lashio in January and is planning a broader transportation distribution scheme.

Levying Transit Taxes Deemed Reasonable

The Chinese government mentioned that the tariffs levied by Burma on transit goods were too high and compared the situation to when French Indochina was opened, when the French authorities waived all fees. The delegation stated that Burma had incurred significant expenses due to this trade, including increased security and customs personnel. Therefore, a fee of one percent of the value was deemed reasonable under the circumstances.

Constructing Railways is Absolutely Necessary

The Chinese government also earnestly stated that, from their perspective, constructing a railway between the two countries was absolutely necessary. Both sides engaged in various discussions regarding the economic feasibility of the railway. The Minister of Transportation presented the delegation with a memorandum on the issue for their consideration. The convenience of telegraph, communication, and air transportation was also discussed. These issues will be considered by the Burmese government.

National Boundaries Hopefully Resolved

The Chinese government also mentioned the long-unresolved issue of the border between the two countries. After numerous discussions, a line that both countries could potentially accept has been drawn and submitted to both governments for final approval. The delegation received a warm welcome from the Chinese government during this visit and received various forms of assistance from the British Embassy in Chongqing. The delegation is highly satisfied with the results it has achieved. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

Chinese Foreign Ministry Issues Communiqué

Chongqing: Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a communiqué formally announcing that the British government has agreed to allocate funds for the construction of a railway from Lashio to the Chinese border, in order to complete railway transportation between China and Burma. The communiqué stated that, in order to develop trade between China and Burma and to facilitate China's general overseas trade, the Chinese government has been negotiating with the British government for several years regarding improvements to transportation between Yunnan and Burma. The Yunnan-Burma Highway was opened in 1938. Although this road has made significant contributions to the development of trade between China and Burma, the convenience it provides is still insufficient given the frequency of transportation between the two countries. Therefore, the Chinese government plans to build a railway in Yunnan Province and has requested that the British and Burmese governments also build a section of railway from Yunnan to the Chinese border, so that the Burmese railway can be connected to the Chinese railway in Yunnan Province. As the Yunnan railway is currently being constructed according to plan, the Chinese government has now received notification from the British authorities that the British government has agreed to allocate funds so that the Burmese government can construct a railway from Lashio to the Chinese border. According to recent decisions made by the Chinese authorities to continue building the Yunnan-Burma Railway, they have reportedly reached an agreement with Washington to issue gold bonds worth US$10 million in the US to finance the construction of the road. The chief engineer of the road is currently in the US discussing the technical issues and railway materials for the road with the authorities and railway companies there. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

Washington: Secretary of State Hull spoke to reporters, defending the government's detention of German, Italian and Danish ships in the US, stating that he did not wish to discuss the best way to dispose of these ships at this time. He had not heard anyone question the absolute legality of this measure, because the destructive acts planned by the sailors endangered American ports. When asked by reporters whether the seizure of ships could be seen as a prelude to entering the war, Hull replied that the US government had long been assisting Britain and other countries under various assistance plans that excluded joining the war, and that today's actions were part of that plan. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

Washington: One hundred German sailors and 775 Italian sailors from the 69 Axis ships seized have been ordered temporarily detained by US authorities, pending deportation, because their stay in the United States has exceeded the 60-day limit allowed by US law for foreign sailors.

### Six Axis Ships Spontaneously Burn

Puerto Cabello, Venezuela: Three Italian ships and [one] German cargo ship were set on fire and sank here. They were apparently acting on instructions because the South American republics might follow the US lead and seize Axis ships. The sailors were arrested by the police and detained ashore. The Italian and German sailors set the fire at 7:00 PM yesterday, turning the port bright red. The fire was so intense that the cargo ships were quickly destroyed. (1st United Press Dispatch)

Puntarenas (Costa Rica):

Yesterday, the sailors and personnel of Italian and German merchant ships, totaling 53 Italians and 48 Germans, set fire to their cargo ships and were secretly sent to prison in the evening to avoid attacks by the crowds in Costa Rica (a small Central American country north of Panama). The two ships that were burned this morning were the Italian cargo ship "Fella", weighing 6,072 tons, and the German cargo ship "Eisenach", weighing 4,177 tons. The flames were intense when the two ships were burned for inaction, lighting up the entire port. The people of the area all stood on the streets, waiting to inflict pain on the German and Italian sailors, but the police had already taken these Fascists and Nazis to prison via secret routes. This action by the police eliminated the anti-Axis movement to attack these German and Italian sailors. It is believed that the German and Italian sailors burned the two ships to prevent them from being detained by the Costa Rican authorities, because it is believed that Costa Rica will also follow the US lead and detain these ships.

Brazilian Capital: Rumors are rampant that Axis ships are currently gathered in the Atlantic Ocean, awaiting escort by German cruisers. This saying is not without reason, because just 24 hours after the German merchant ship "Dresden" (5,567 tons) sailed from Santos, Brazil, the Italian merchant ships "Matteotti" (10,800 tons) and "Flisco" (4,610 tons) also sailed out of other Brazilian ports, all claiming to be heading for Oslo, Norway. The "Matteotti" is an oil tanker that was previously unable to leave due to debt, but recently an Italian from Sao Paulo remitted the debt, freeing it to move. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

London: It is believed today that the British government will propose to lease the 35 Danish ships seized by the United States.

However, payment will likely be deferred until the end of the war. The British authorities expressed satisfaction with the US's seizure of Danish ships, as this measure can prevent the Danish ships from being sunk by their sailors. (1st United Press Dispatch)

Washington: US officials are currently studying the final disposition of the seized ships. Currently, the ships are still under surveillance, and their ownership still belongs to the original owners. According to Treasury Department officials, the seized ships may be used, because Britain is in dire need of ships and there is a shortage of shipping worldwide. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

However, there is no change in Italian-Cuban relations."

Oriental Newspaper Editorial Exposes Ambitions

Tokyo: An editorial in the "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that if Thailand cannot break free from British economic influence, it is impossible for it to participate in the establishment of a new Asia. Therefore, Japan should strive to establish closer economic relations with Thailand in order to eliminate British economic power in Thailand. Thailand imports over 50% of its goods from Britain, and it is estimated that over 90% of Thailand's exports are shipped to Britain. It is reported that Britain holds 83% of Thailand's foreign exchange reserves, and it is said that 90% of Thailand's monetary reserves are deposited in Britain. Given this situation, it is no exaggeration to say that Thailand's national economy is controlled by Britain. Thailand has repeatedly considered reforming its monetary system, but each time it accepts the British plan. British influence has deeply penetrated Thailand's industry, commerce, and politics, and it will not be easy for Thailand to eliminate this problem. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

### British Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Greatly Insufficient

London: Official circles recently released revenue statistics, revealing the enormity of the war's costs to British taxpayers. According to these statistics, Britain's expenditure in the fiscal year ending last night reached an unprecedented height, totaling £3,876,245,670, an average of £10,500,000 per day over the past twelve months. However, in the past three months, the average daily expenditure has increased to approximately £513,000,000. The total recurrent revenue for the same year was £1,408,876,079, leaving a shortfall of £2,458,378,573 after deducting the huge expenditure. Therefore, the financial difficulties in the next budget are whether to implement new taxes to reduce the deficit or to borrow to make up for it. The total expenditure for the last fiscal year, belonging to the supply category, including military expenditures, totaled £3,637,113,000, compared to only £1,078,257,000 in the previous year. An exciting feature of the statistics is that the total recurrent revenue increased by £359,678,404,404 compared to last year, and this is due to the satisfactory implementation of new taxes such as purchase tax proposed in the Finance Minister’s budget. Most revenue items have shown large increases, such as customs duties and domestic taxes (roughly including purchase tax), with a total increase of £129,000,000 from the previous year. The amount by which expenditures exceeded revenue has been made up for by borrowing. In the past year, revolving debt has increased by £1,324,000,000, bringing the total to £2,813,400,000, compared to £1,489,000,000 a year ago. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

### Southern Anti-German Sentiment Surges; German Residents Retreat from the South; Southern Premier Urges People to Remain Calm; Rumor Has It Southern Border with Romania is Now Sealed

Southern Capital City: This location is not far from the nearest German airfield within Romanian territory, only a 20-minute flight away. However, the Southern capital has kept its lights on at night since the coup, shining as usual, while the Romanian capital is under a blackout. Such is the difference in the atmospheres of the capitals of the Southern and Romanian countries. German residents in the South are continuing to leave the country. On Sunday, the German ambassador, Herren, oversaw the departure of 1,100 German residents on a Danube River special ship, including 100 so-called tourists. Before leaving, they left messages with their innkeepers, saying they would return within a month. Most of their furniture was left there, and they did not cancel their leases. British women and children, following the instructions of the British Ambassador Campbell, had almost all set off for Turkey's capital on Saturday night. Last night, another special train carried Germans to Vienna. As for Italian residents, they had already left the country. Regarding the talk of German troops concentrating on the Southern border, it is difficult to verify. However, it is widely known that there are some mechanized units stationed on the Austrian border, and many railway lines south of the Hungarian capital make it easy for German troops to move. Once German troops press the border, the Southern army will likely defend mountain positions, as the flat border is suitable for German air attacks. A semi-official statement here says that some German residents are leaving because of regrettable incidents caused by irresponsible people during patriotic demonstrations on March 27th and 28th. The Southern government and public opinion generally regret these unfortunate incidents. The government has specifically ordered the public to remain calm in any environment, not to pay attention to alarming rumors. The government is now making every effort to dispel any doubts about the South's intention to maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries. On Sunday, Southern Premier Simović broadcast an article nationwide, saying that for the sake of national interests, the people must protect their own villages. If necessary, they should defend the country and the King with their lives. The army, air force, and navy are now ready to fulfill their duties. (Reuters, 1st)

Southern Capital City: Yesterday, the Southern country publicly issued a statement regarding the public's anti-German demonstrations, apologizing to Germany and urging the people to remain calm in order to maintain peace. The statement also said that the government is making its best efforts to foster friendship with neighboring countries. At the same time, people close to the German delegation said that the German ambassador to South Africa, Herren, has left South Africa to return to his country to "report on the situation." Reliable sources also said that Germany has submitted an ultimatum to South Africa, limiting South Africa's demobilization of its troops, which they called "absurd and untrue." Also, intelligence from the Southern capital received by Hungary's capital said that South Africa is mobilizing. Southern Prime Minister Simović also issued an order advising people not to abandon their homes and families, and advising them not to believe alarming reports that are intended to cause unnecessary panic, as there are many refugees from Serbian South Africa in the high city. (Associated Press, 1st)

London: Yesterday, German and Italian residents left the Southern country one after another. At the same time, the Axis propaganda machine conducted its psychological warfare against the Southern country. German official radio broadcasts quoted German residents returning home as saying that Southern soldiers and students held anti-German demonstrations, shouting "Long live England!" and smashing Germans. In addition, there were incidents of beating Germans and looting German stores. Italian newspapers also carried similar news. (Reuters, 1st)

### Germany Has Maintained Contact with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, Planning to Deal With the Situation

Berlin: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman announced yesterday afternoon that Germany and the countries of the Balkans, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, have not been able to understand Yugoslavia's anti-German measures, so all countries have taken precautionary measures. The German government, in view of this situation, has now maintained close contact with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. Regarding the Macedonian issue raised by Bulgaria, the spokesman replied that he could not comment on this issue at this time. (Haitong News Agency, 1st)

Berlin: A Foreign Ministry spokesman recently told the press that Yugoslavia has joined the "Axis," and there is no problem with the new government's approval of the Tripartite Pact. It is rumored that the country's authorities have declared their policies. The German government has not received formal notification. What the country's attitude will be hereafter will be decided by the country itself. As far as Germany is concerned, since Yugoslavia is one of its allies, it is naturally inconvenient to take any action against it in principle. However, in order to maintain German policies and the interests of the German nation, it still has the right to take necessary measures to deal with the enemy. As for the attitude of Croatia towards the new government of Yugoslavia, it is an internal affair of that country and should be resolved by the government of that country itself. Germany is also inconvenient to interfere in it. (Havas, 31st)

Southern Capital City: There were rumors here last night that Germany would issue an ultimatum, but military figures here believe that it is doubtful that Germany has sufficient troops on the Yugoslav border to launch a major offensive. It is said that the Southern country will never violate its neutral status and will not fight unless attacked. It can almost be said that Germany cannot currently gather a large army on the northern border of South Africa to immediately invade, because most of the troops it can deploy in Austria have already been sent to Bulgaria via Hungary and Romania. The current government of South Africa is different from the previous government, and it will recognize that the German attack on Thessaloniki is an infringement of the interests of South Africa. Today, the official news agency of Yugoslavia has refuted the German claim that the German minority in South Africa has been abused and their property has been infringed upon. The Germans have claimed that demonstrations have taken place in the Southern capital of South Africa, with demonstrators carrying British and Polish flags and threatening the lives of German residents, which is completely unfounded. At present, the German minority in Yugoslavia continues to enjoy all civil rights, living and working in peace, like all other citizens of South Africa. The news agency also refuted the claim that some German minorities have fled to Romania due to maltreatment. (Reuters, 1st)

### Rumor Has It That South Africa Has Issued a General Mobilization Order; The Capital Is Rushing to Build Air-Raid Shelters

Budapest: According to news from Bulgaria's capital yesterday, Bulgaria has issued a general mobilization order. The railway and telephone traffic between Bulgaria and South Africa was previously interrupted.

Southern Capital City: Anti-aircraft guns have been erected on the streets of the Southern capital, and residents of Belgrade are rushing to build basements to protect against air raids and preparing for a complete blackout of the country. Generals who oppose war with Germany yesterday suggested that if the Southern defense line starts from the Drina River, Croatia can be placed outside the defense line. If South Africa implements this plan, it is very likely that Maček, the leader of Croatia, will not participate in the new government. Yesterday, one of Maček's representatives arrived in Belgrade and met with General Simović. It is said that the outcome of the talks will largely depend on Croatia's position in the current crisis. 1,500 Montenegrins were arrested yesterday amid the sounds of war. Officials have not made any explanation for the reasons for the arrest. South Africa is now working hard to reconcile with Germany and has repeatedly assured the Axis powers in order to gain sufficient time to complete its mobilization and to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Greece. (International News Agency, 1st)

London: London newspapers received a dispatch from Athens saying that 35 German officers and gunners were among the crew members rescued from the Italian cruisers and destroyers that sank in the Mediterranean. (Reuters, 1st)

Alexandria: Regarding the British Navy's great defeat of the Italian fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, more detailed reports have recently been received here. It is learned that the enemy ship losses must have totaled seven, including four cruisers and three destroyers, and one Italian Littorio-class battleship was repeatedly bombed by British Navy aircraft with torpedoes and was severely damaged. The British fleet suffered no damage and no one was injured. It has now sailed back to Alexandria. The process of luring out an enemy ship by a British cruiser and destroying it has been revealed. As soon as the Italian ship came out, it suddenly saw a British 30,000-ton giant ship leading the British fleet and the battleships "Barham" and "Valiant" following behind. Panicked, it immediately scurried away. The British fleet cooperated in the pursuit for 12 hours, firing volleys of artillery shells, and fiercely bombed the enemy cruiser that had already been hit by an aerial torpedo, and then left the destroyers to complete the task of destroying the enemy. After returning to port, General Cunningham, commander-in-chief of the British fleet in the Mediterranean, praised the cooperation of the officers and men of his subordinates and the naval air force in achieving this great naval victory. When asked about the strength of the Italian fleet, General Cunningham replied that he estimated that the Italian battleship had lost two-thirds of its strength, and the cruisers and destroyers equipped with 8-inch guns had lost more than half of their strength. One-quarter of the cruisers and destroyers equipped with 6-inch guns have been lost, and the loss of submarines is difficult to estimate. Two-thirds of the larger losses. General Cunningham also said that he had allowed the Italian Littorio-class 35,000-ton battleship "Vittorio Veneto" to escape, but the captain of the sunken Italian cruiser "Pola" believed that the "Vittorio Veneto" had indeed sunk. The "Pola" was hit by a torpedo fired by a British aircraft in the engine room and could not move. It then surrendered to the British ship "Jervis." The British ship took the Italian captain, 21 officers, and 236 sailors on board and then fired a torpedo to sink the "Pola." (Reuters, 2nd)

### Further Talks on the European War (43): Inside Wartime Germany

The author of this article, William L. Shirer, went to Europe from the United States in 1925 to work as a correspondent for the Chicago Tribune and the Universal News Service. He covered news in various parts of Europe and on the Asian front. In 1937, he transferred to the European office of the Columbia Broadcasting System as a news reporter. After the outbreak of the European War, he stayed in Berlin and continuously broadcast news from the German side to the Americas. He returned to the United States in the winter of 1940 and, at the request of "Life" magazine, drafted this article. He vividly describes the various situations during wartime in Germany, making it feel both intimate and meaningful. Thus, we have translated it as follows.

For the Germans, the winter of 1940 was actually the eighth year of the German army's attempt to conquer Europe. After Hitler came to power in 1933, the decision to wage a European war was made long ago, and by September 1939, it had developed into the "total war" at its peak. Under the rule of the National Socialist Party, the Germans never knew what "total peace" was. No other country in the world could transform from peacetime to wartime as easily as Germany. If the attitude of the Germans is still the same today as before, it must be attributed to the fact that for the past eight years, they have been working hard for long hours at low wages and have had to "tighten their belts."

When France was defeated in June 1939, the foreigners living in Berlin all thought that this time, the people all over Germany would spontaneously rejoice. However, apart from Hitler ordering the raising of flags and the ringing of church bells throughout the country, and the citizens giving him an unprecedented grand welcome upon his triumphal return to Berlin, very few Germans who did not belong to the National Socialist Party showed enthusiastic emotions towards this event.

On the day Germany captured Paris, I was on the shore of the Wannsee in Berlin. There were about a thousand Germans there, most of them sunbathing. I mingled among the crowd, and in the conversations I heard, I never heard anyone mention the word "Paris." Although the German radio station had reported the fall of Paris in the 2:00 PM news broadcast, this really surprised me. Around 3:00 PM, several very excited news vendors ran towards the shore, shouting, "Extra! Extra! Paris has fallen! The victorious German army has entered Paris!" But at such a historical moment, they only sold a few copies of the newspaper.

Only the British air raids on German territory made everyone realize the difference between the bleak period of half-war and half-peace from 1933 to 1939 and the real wartime. Berlin was extremely vigilant against air raids. Although the recent British air raids on Berlin averaged only twice a week, they were always vigilant.

In the Hotel Adlon, where I was staying, none of the guests could complain to the hotel that the alerts received during the British air raids were insufficient. Whenever the British planes were still in the air, the city-wide alarm would sound first. Then the female telephone operators in the telephone exchange would desperately shake your phone, until you answered. Finally, a strong waiter would stand in front of your room and knock on a copper plate with all his might. After these several warnings, you would of course run to the air-raid shelter in the basement of the hotel to take refuge, but this was not mandatory. Almost all of the Americans staying at the hotel – a total of about a dozen – were willing to stay in bed and have fun with death. Since Goering issued an order that only those who were injured or even died while taking refuge in an air-raid shelter during an air raid could receive state compensation, some people desperately rushed to the basement as soon as an air-raid alarm sounded.

When I left Berlin on December 23, 1940, the Hotel Adlon had not yet been bombed. However, those who lived in this hotel were free to choose whether to take refuge in the basement during an air raid. The remaining 4.5 million residents of Berlin had to obey the command of a new-style dictator when there was an air-raid alarm in the city. This dictator had not yet appeared in American newspapers. He was neither Hitler nor Himmler. In fact, his name belonged to the majority. His name was the "house warden," and from the moment an air-raid alarm sounded until it was lifted, everyone who stayed in the house he managed, regardless of wealth or status, was subject to his control. Usually, the effective time of this house warden's dictatorship started at 9:00 PM and ended at 5:00 AM the next morning. Many basements in Berlin considered him the most hateful person in the world, because most of these door wardens, once they had "power" in their hands, would certainly "exercise their authority."

When Berlin was first bombed, many house wardens believed that if you talked to others in the basement, even if it was just a whisper, you would consume more air than you deserved. (Even scientists couldn't figure out why they thought that way.) Therefore, they forbade all conversations in the basement. Sitting stiffly in a crowded, dark, and damp basement for seven or eight hours, unable to speak except to breathe, was an unbearable torture for the people of Berlin, even though they were known for their docility. After Goering learned of the public's complaints, he ordered the cancellation of this ban, allowing everyone to talk in the basement. However, under the management of all good house wardens, smoking in the air-raid shelter was still prohibited. Unless you encountered those house wardens who turned a blind eye, they would allow you to go upstairs and quickly take a few puffs of a cigarette.

The wardens had the legal right to make your life uncomfortable, so most people in Berlin tried to be careful in front of them to avoid bad luck. For example, they had the right to designate which people should stay in the basement after the alarm was lifted to clean it up and ventilate the air. It was not fun to do this work around 4:00 AM, but the bank executives, if they were not polite to the wardens during the air raid, could not escape the taste of this hard work.

Some people who spoke rudely to the wardens also tasted their revenge, which was to be ordered to run to the roof or to the street center during the bombing to do some kind of work. Although Müller was worthy of being a giant in the business world, when the anti-aircraft guns were firing and shrapnel was raining down, the warden would order him to go to the roof to put out an incendiary bomb. His fame and high position during the day could not protect him from this errand.

Recently, in order to make people in the air-raid shelters feel humorous, Goebbels ordered the newspapers to publish humorous cartoons about underground life. One of them, which was widely circulated, depicted a young man being awakened by an alarm in the middle of the night, running to the basement, and calling out to his neighbors who had already gathered. Among them was a beautiful young woman whose clothes were obviously put on in extreme haste. He felt embarrassed. Among the air-raid stories circulating in Berlin, the one that Goebbels forbade to tell was the most hilarious. The Berlin Air Defense Director recently stipulated that citizens must go to bed at 8:00 PM every night, so that everyone can get two or three hours of sleep before the daily bombing. Some people did this, but most people ignored it. Therefore, the people of Berlin told the following story: those who were ordered to do so would step into the basement and say "Good morning" when they saw their neighbors, indicating that they had already slept. Others would say "Good evening" when they came, indicating that they had not yet slept. Still others would shout "Heil Hitler!" as soon as they arrived, indicating that they had been sleeping all the time.

There were not many large-scale public air-raid shelters in Berlin, and even fewer suitable basements. Most of the basements were built three or four feet underground along the street, so bombs or shrapnel from anti-aircraft guns could easily fly in through the windows level with the ground. Berlin was also different from London or Paris in that it could not find sandbags to prevent shrapnel from entering the room through the windows. Because Germany did not produce hemp, it lacked bags for holding sand. There were very few houses in Berlin with sandbags piled up. The American Embassy was one of the few houses with sandbags piled up outside the windows on the ground floor. Only museums had sandbags placed outside German houses. There were no sandbags to protect the official residences of many ministers on Wilhelmstrasse. Many private houses did not even have basements. In the event of an air raid, they had to run to the nearest public air-raid shelter or temporary trenches in the streets for shelter. (To be continued)

### Food Supply: Price Limits Have In Visibly Been Abolished – Let Us See What Happens to the People's Food Supply

More than 680,000 bags of rice arrived in March; a total of 1.7 million bags arrived in three months; the rice is not too little, and the price is not too high.

A large amount of foreign rice has arrived, as revealed by this newspaper daily. It has been found that imports in March were much higher than in January and February, totaling 687,410 bags. Among them, 124,621 bags were directly shipped from Saigon, 17,497 bags were directly shipped from Siam, 22,500 bags were directly shipped from Rangoon, and the remaining 306,792 bags were transshipped to Shanghai from Hong Kong. As of the end of January this year, a total of 1,700,674 bags had arrived in Shanghai in three months. It can be seen that the rice supply in this city is sufficient, and the continuous rise in rice prices is inappropriate. (Zu)

The rice market has seen a large number of foreign rice shipments arriving daily, but the rice price in this city remains stubbornly in the old state. Hoarders dare to rely on their rice stockpiles as if they were the Great Wall, remaining steadfastly unmoved. This is because there is no way to stop them locally, and also because shipping companies are taking advantage of the situation, excessively raising their shipping fees. If the shipping fees were slightly lower, they would refuse to load the rice. Therefore, if the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan to allocate ships to transport Rangoon rice to Shanghai could be realized soon, the rice price would be leveled out sooner, and hoarders would have no hope and would naturally sell their hoarded goods. The key to the future rice price lies in whether the shipping fees for rice are cheaper. If the shipping fees rise again, the rice price will soar again. Moreover, since the rice merchants questioned the Appraisal Committee, there has been talk that the Appraisal Committee would resign to the Shanghai Municipal Council. In fact, this kind of appraisal work has little significance. With the Price Permitting Committee, secret price reductions are rampant. Without an appraisal, it would be no different. However, it is unknown how those responsible for regulating the people's food supply will handle this matter in the future. Because the appraisal committee members resigned, the market price opened yesterday canceled the previous price reductions of several thousand or several hundred yuan per hundred bags and instead normally changed to opening at a certain amount per dan. A large number of spot goods were released, causing the market to be flooded with goods, and the supply and demand were uneven. The selling price was difficult to maintain. Under the competition of various parties to sell, the price dropped steadily. As a result, the closing price fell by three or four yuan or so compared to the previous day. For example, No. 1 Saigon Siam opened at 112 yuan per dan in the early morning, but later only 110 yuan. No. 2 opened at 108 yuan, but only reached 106 yuan. Xiao Jiao opened at 106 yuan and returned to 104 yuan. Rice tea was 92 or 3 yuan, and broken tip was 85 yuan or 84 and a half yuan.

A steady supply of thick and thin Geng and other foreign rice has arrived, so that most cargo owners, seeing the foreign rice market weak, relaxed their willingness to sell. Local shops and wholesalers also saw that the situation of foreign rice was very different, fearing that a drastic change would occur again, and the impact would be difficult to predict, so they all adopted a prudent approach. Except for a small purchase for emergency needs, they did not dare to enter more rashly. Therefore, although the cargo owners invited them to sell at a reduced price, and the market price fell by two or three yuan, the sales market was still sluggish, and the situation was even more depressed than before. It is estimated that Changbang showed special white Geng at 120 yuan per dan, high Geng at 118 yuan, the original package at 124.5 yuan and 124 yuan. Kunshan showed high Geng at 115 or 6 yuan, big market at 112 or 3 yuan, settled at 108, 88 or 9 yuan. Qingjiao showed thin rice at 108.5 yuan or 108 yuan, and the original package at 113 yuan or 112.5 yuan.

Because those who were hoarding glutinous rice followed the foreign rice and released it for sale, the market goods suddenly became crowded. However, the outlet was very small. Except for some pastry shops and rice peddlers, wholesale sales all stopped, causing the market to become uniformly sluggish, and the price dropped by one or two yuan. Hong Kong special yuan was estimated at 104 or 5 yuan, the big market at 102 or 3 yuan, settled at 98 or 9 yuan. Glutinous rice was 95 yuan, settled at broken 89 yuan.

Powder market first weak and then flat. The market opened in the morning, bearing the weak wind of the previous day, and with constant reports of large amounts of Kan powder arriving, people's hearts were still depressed. The number of sellers of recycled goods in the market gradually increased, but the actual sales and buyers were very lacking. Jinlong brand Kan powder once fell to the 29 yuan level. Later, it was heard that although the rice price was weak, the price limit had been invisibly abolished, so some buyers took the opportunity to absorb slightly at a low price. It is estimated that Zhonglou brand was 29 yuan, 3 jiao and a half to 3 jiao, and Jinlong brand Kan powder was 29 yuan, 1 jiao to 29 yuan. The market gradually entered a state of brewing. The original price of plain-selling powder from the Chinese factory was 25 yuan, and more than 5,000 bags were approved by the Fuxin factory, and the rest were matched with foreign powder.

The wheat market was sluggish and stable as usual. The arrival of goods from the mainland has been rare for a long time, and occasionally there are sporadic arrivals, most of which go directly to the factory. The market wants to buy but has no goods, only shouting prices, but no actual transactions. The future of the market is difficult to be optimistic because the powder market is loose and weak.

### Oil Cakes: Soybean Oil Gradually Reveals a Wave

Yesterday's soybean oil market, first because there was a slight sales market in this street, and hoarders also pulled up the price, so in the middle, there was a lot of competition between the long and short positions, and the price rose and fell suddenly. However, the potential was in ordinary actual sales, and hoarders also sold a lot, so the weakness was fully revealed. As a result, the closing price was slightly less than half a yuan compared to the previous day's market. Thirty pieces of Yanzhi oil were opened at a price of 98 yuan, 100 dans of Dayou factory oil at a price of 105 yuan, 100 barrels of Hankou barrel oil at 142 yuan, 30 barrels of Dalian oil at 143 yuan. Ordering 500 barrels to be delivered in April, the price rose from 142 yuan and 5 jiao to 3 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, and then fell to 42 yuan. Ordering 600 barrels to be delivered in the second half of April, the price rose from 144 yuan to 5 yuan and 5 jiao, and then fell to 144 yuan. There were 450 bags of soybeans transported to Singapore on the 2nd.

### Finance: Exchange Market is Quiet

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listing reported flat, and the British and American exchange dark market was silent and ordinary, without any excitement. The trading was light, and it was even quieter in the afternoon. However, the potential was first tight and then flat. Initially, it was because the Japanese bank and importers pushed in, so it was soft, and it was once reduced to 3 pence, 1.1875 and 5 yuan 25. Later, speculators and floating households sold out, and finally returned to flat. As a result, the closing price was still the same as the previous day, calculated as 3 pence, 234375 and 5 yuan, 28125.

At that time, the spot shilling was also soft to 3 pence 21875, and HSBC's listing was announced without movement, and the silver balance tax was announced as flat.

### Gold Market Mediocre: Increased Commission Makes Trading Scarce

Yesterday's gold market was still unable to escape the hovering situation. The good news from the previous day, the public concession area of this city is still difficult to implement, and the panic of all parties is temporarily stable. The US exchange rate returned from loose to flat, and the market price turned from rising to falling. After the morning opening, it was inevitable that the after-effects of the previous night would remain, and the buying sentiment was strong. The price rose from Hengji to 6,595 yuan. Because the 600 yuan mark was not easy to break through, when the long side was thinking about moving, the US exchange rate suddenly stopped tightening and returned. The sale of Jintongxiang, Hechengji, Deda, and the securities firm Yida Defu exchange merchant Xinfeng Yongdafeng, etc., fell to the low price of 6,543 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the American bank absorbed the US exchange rate, and the trend was not easy to loosen. It once soared to 6,575 yuan, and finally saw the setback, the small reduction of 17 or 9 yuan, and after the closing it fell again to 6,545 yuan. Because of the increased commission (one in one out overnight), each article must be 5 jiao, and the trading became scarce. 15,000 taels, the cash trend is stable, the gold shop Hechengji first sold 20 taels to a certain silver building, which according to the futures transaction was 140 yuan higher, and then sold 160 taels to Xiangxingyong, and then 50 taels to Lianxing, and Dayuan sold 150 taels to Xiangxingyong, all 130 yuan higher. At noon, there was a buyer at 140 yuan higher, and in the afternoon there was still no sale, and the buyer was unwilling to add Gao Shouxi, and no transaction was heard, a few yuan less than the previous day, and the jewelry gold was once listed as low as 680 yuan, and then returned to the top, still 690 yuan, and the customs gold was flat.

Hoard is Difficult to Revive

In the early morning, each article (ten taels) opened flat, first reporting 6,570 yuan, 4 yuan smaller than the previous day. However, soon Dafeng, Rencheng Yong, Gonghe, etc. came to search for purchases, and the exchange market suddenly softened, and Defu and Hengji also bought, and the price gradually rose to 6,595 yuan. At that time, Xianghe, Lianxing, Deda, etc. took advantage of the high and sold sharply, gradually trending downstream. Soon it returned to 6,570 yuan, and then Hechengji and Tongkangyong searched and entered, Hengji entered again, and at that time the typhoon was still good, and there were many retail investors who absorbed and bought, and it rose again to 6,590 yuan. Later, because Decheng and Xiangxingyong sold out, the high price was difficult to maintain for a long time, and the Father returned to fall to 6,580 yuan. Moreover, because the exchange market returned from tight to flat, Yida, Dafeng, Xinfengyong, and Shunyuan rushed to sell hard. In addition, Defu and Hengji's long positions returned, and although Xianghe continued to absorb and make up for the short positions in the middle, it was ultimately difficult to maintain, and it fell to 6,543 yuan before the closing, and the closing was reported at 6,546 yuan, and the outside of the market slightly rebounded, with the last being 6,554 or 5 yuan. The afternoon opening was 6,555 yuan, and it once fell by 5 yuan in an instant. Fortunately, Xinfengyong came to rescue frequently, and the market gradually stabilized. After Dafeng, Tongkangyong, Gonghe, etc. pulled up again, it once rebounded to 6,575 yuan. However, Hengji took advantage of the high and sold sharply, and the connection to Dafeng stopped and sold instead, and the market trend finally went down again. In the evening, a profit, Xinyuan, etc. also sold, a small reduction to 6,555 yuan. As a result, the closing price of 6,557 yuan was 17 yuan less than the closing price of the previous day. According to the closing price of the US gold of 5 yuan 28125 for the current month, it was still 6,594 yuan and 1 jiao, which was 37 yuan and 1 jiao less. There were 52 yuan of decline on the same day, and Dafeng came out again after the pasture, falling to 6,545 yuan. The selling price of the cash number's own brand gold was 150 yuan higher than the Hoard futures trading price, and the income was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no difference in the current standard gold, and there was no price.

Ornament Gold First Small Then Return

The outgoing price of the gold and silver shop's jewelry gold per tael, Datonghang and Xintonghang once listed as small as 680 yuan at noon, and returned to the top at 4 p.m., still 690 yuan, and the income was reduced by 40 yuan.

### Securities: Fewer Entries of Domestic Debt, Long Side Still Quite Stable

The public debt dark market, yesterday's market situation, still went downstream. The previous trend was still firm, but it was still unable to pull up. Yesterday, the number of entries was small, and there was an image of fleeting. The transaction was extremely light, which has been the usual practice in recent months. When the market price fell, the transaction was bound to be clear, and when the market price rose, the transaction was bound to be strong. This can show that the long side is extremely stable, and most people are unwilling to sell out with the flow. Yesterday's transaction, in the morning, only Qianyi 90% slightly entered, and Runde Lianyi Defu Dingkang sold out, and the noon income was 3 or 4 jiao. In the afternoon, the rest of Jiyu Shunchang 90% Xinyuan and Lianyi bought in, and Yuxing Father had a large number of sales, and Hefeng Yiji Xinchang also had sales. As a result, the unanimous return fell by 1 jiao and a half to 4 jiao and a half, and the total number of transactions was no more than 890,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below, the category is the highest, the lowest closing price is better than the previous day

Stock trading, 100 old shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, the price is 20 yuan and 7 jiao and a half.

The public industry association stock market opened firmly, and the trend of each stock was still extremely active. Jardine Matheson & Co. had a lot of turnover, and the opening price of 113 yuan and a half rose to 118 yuan and a half at the closing. The rubber stocks were Ning Jing.

The British merchant Mai Bian Yanghang passed the Karen Dandong Oak Co., Ltd. The board of directors decided that the final dividend for this year should be issued at one jiao per share.

London 31st (Monday) Telegram, today's listing prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks, bank stocks re-trended downstream, McCalle Bank stocks fell 2 shillings and 6 pence, the price was 8 and a half pounds, HSBC Bank stocks fell half a pound each, the British registered stock price was 73 and a half pounds, the Hong Kong registered stock price was 76 and a half pounds, the rest unchanged.

### Yarn Flowers Actual Sales Sluggish: Yarn Market Wants to Rise But Is Blocked

Yesterday's yarn market, which had turned up on the previous day, returned to flatness. This state has very little glory or humiliation to distinguish, and it is still a hovering situation. As for the actual needs, it is particularly dull. The Hong Kong gang only bought 50 bags, the mainland gang 5 bags, and no transactions were heard in other bags. In this situation, the yarn market lacks excitement. However, some people slightly ate a few bags and pulled up the price due to the good return of the standard gold, showing a slight appearance of brilliance, but soon it was still depressed and weak. On this basis, it is still in a dull road for the time being. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,408 yuan, and the low price was 1,392 yuan. The first transaction in the afternoon was 1,403 yuan, rising to 1,405 yuan and a half, and the final price was 1,404 yuan. The transaction was very light, and most people were waiting and watching. 30 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong today. Shuangma opened in the morning, bearing the continued firmness of the dark market turning up on the previous day. The first transaction price was 1,406 yuan. In an instant, it rose to 1,408 yuan. However, although the long side shouted to pull up the price at this time, new buyers were not enthusiastic, and the securities gang and floating long positions sold out instead, causing the platform to slacken and fall to 1,400 yuan. It stood for a long time between 01 and 2 yuan. Subsequently, the pale standard gold slightly挫, and at the same time, the actual demand was calm. Seeing that the environment was unfavorable, the scalpers began to cut the market, and the market gradually declined, closing at 1,392 yuan. According to the statistics of transactions between 1,000 rooms, the amount of purchases from each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 50 Mainland 5

Peer 5,900 Statistics 5,955

### Cotton Market Active: Selling Price Also Expensive

The current cotton situation is very active, and people in the industry are generally hoping for a rise. Because there are concerns about future sources, and the Shanghai stock is thin, not as thick as cloth yarn, so mutual buying and selling is more lively. As for the factory side, because the yarn sales are poor, the compensation for raw materials is relatively indifferent. However, in the current situation, the cotton market situation is one step higher than the yarn market. Therefore, the coarse and fine raw materials were quite lively yesterday, with a total of 1,864 pieces and 1,397 bales transacted, and the price was one or two yuan. The current cotton transaction prices are listed on the left:

Hui Si Deng 301.5 Inside and Outside 200 Pieces Sent to Factory

Mei Peng Jia Po 295 Shen Xin 100 Pieces and Two Factories

Mi Te Ling 70.0 and 100 Pieces and

Indian American Seed 340 and 100 Pieces and

Da Zhong Iron Frame 280 and 400 Pieces and

Secondary Hui Si Deng 260 and 400 Pieces and

South Taicang 205 Guangqin 300 Bales and

Fire Machine Grass 202.0 Peers 400 Bales and

Bale

Donggou Flower 207.5 Guangqin 300 Bales and

Jiading Flower 32 Peers 397 Bales Stack Exchange

Brazilian Flower 358.5 and 114 Pieces and

And 359.7 and 100 Pieces

And 361.50 and 100 Pieces

Xing Heng Flower 229.00 and 100 Pieces

Special Hui Si 302.5 and 100 Pieces

Deng

Bai Luo Qu 249.00 and 150 Pieces

Bai Luo Qu 247.50 and 100 Pieces

Another message is that the foreign cotton trading of Shanghai foreign firms is slightly colder than before, but the market situation is still firm, because the overseas procurement of foreign cotton feels difficult, and the Shanghai stock is still scarce, so the cotton price does not soften due to the silence.

### Coal: Coal Storage Mountainous Coal Ball Factory Tries Its Best to Hoard

The coal ball market, formerly due to the strike of factory workers, was secretly raised. The industry factory price was 226 yuan per ton by car, and 229 yuan when delivered. As a result, the retail price of each white market catty in this street's gate was raised from 12.3 yuan to 14.5 yuan. Now that the strike has been resolved and the wages have been increased by 40%, the factory should resume work and deliver goods as soon as possible. However, one or two large factories, regardless of the people's livelihood, use all kinds of hoarding methods, and even destroy their own stoves, and refuse to deliver goods. The goods produced by small factories are not enough to supply, resulting in an abnormal shortage of goods circulating in the market. The selling price has been raised again, and yesterday it was raised again to 245 yuan per ton, and the retail price of each hundred market catties in the gate cost 12 yuan, but there is often no spot supply. The hoarding of coal balls is easier than the hoarding of foreign rice as long as one or two factories take action. If it is thought that the original slope is lacking, but looking at the accumulated coal along Maigen Road and Sapo Sai Road, it can prove that it is me. The intention is to deliver the goods after the coal balls are raised to the price they want in their hearts.

### British, American, and Japanese Consuls Establish Agreement: Changed the Number of Board Members and Authorized Feilipu to Issue a Statement: Hope the Atmosphere of the Concession Can Be Peaceful

Feilipu, the chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council, hosted Chinese and foreign journalists last night to explain the reasons for the postponement of the election. His words said: This year's board election has been postponed twice at the request of the council. This situation must have attracted the attention of the public, so I will explain it as follows. Some time ago, responsible people in the foreign community felt that the current administrative methods of the public concession were not satisfactory under the current situation. Not long ago, the council published the report of the "Special Election Committee." Before the committee was established, it did not provide any suggestions, because the committee members had an equal division of opinions on the biggest issue of voting qualifications.

Consuls of Three Countries Negotiate

Most people felt that holding elections with the possibility of disputes and conflicts would not be beneficial to the public concession at present. Therefore, efforts have been made to make the election unnecessary, expand the number of board members, and conduct negotiations with the British, American, and Japanese consuls regarding the greatest interests of the public concession.

Establish Agreement Postpone Election

I am now authorized to state that as a result of the above-mentioned negotiations, an agreement has been established. This agreement is completely informal and must be agreed to by other relevant countries, but the establishment of this agreement is considered sufficient for the council to request the leading consuls to repeatedly postpone the election.

Temporarily Reset the Number of Directors

The consuls of the above three countries authorized me to state that they have agreed to recommend to the consuls of the consular corps and the Chinese government that within a limited period of time, the number of board members should be four Chinese, three British, three American, three Japanese, one German, and two of other nationalities. It is hoped that this agreement will be supported by the public.

Current Situation Requires Cooperation

Those currently responsible for the administration of the concession are encountering some urgent and important issues. I would like to specifically list a few, such as raising funds to cope with the high cost of living and prices, and assisting in obtaining sufficient rice to meet the needs of the citizens. The handling of these issues requires the cooperation and goodwill of responsible people from all countries. The time when Shanghai can be a properly managed meeting of taxpayers of thousands of nationalities with different languages has passed, and the procedures adopted based on the rural gatherings of a small British market are no longer applicable to one of the world's largest cities. This is well known to those who are generally familiar with the situation of the concession.

Expect to Obtain a Peaceful Atmosphere

As stated above, the consuls of the three countries have worked with the greatest interests of the concession to make appropriate adjustments to the municipal institutions, in order to establish a more peaceful atmosphere and make the above-mentioned issues easier to handle. The current period is not a very suitable time to permanently resolve the Shanghai issue. First, if the concession wants to continue to exist and its administration to continue to be implemented, it should seek a temporary solution that can obtain the goodwill of the majority.

Minimize Misunderstandings

In addition, it can be explained that the above-mentioned consuls of the three countries will try to obtain the necessary agreement on the above-mentioned agreement to make it legal, and at the same time give us a temporary mechanism to expand the number of board members and minimize the opportunity for misunderstandings between people of all countries.

British and American Parties Oppose Compromise

After Fei's published the above statement, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency visited a certain authoritative observer to ask for his opinion. According to the conversation, "I recall that Anjing Yuanwu, the Japanese member of the Special Election Committee, originally intended to destroy the election system and methods adopted in the past, and suggested implementing a one-vote system. When it was resolutely opposed by the British and American parties, they believed that this move was inconsistent with the current legal arguments and exceeded the scope of the council's power. The land charter is the constitution of the concession, and the council has no power to amend it. Therefore, the Japanese's initial attack was unsuccessful. Because of the disastrous defeat in the previous election, this year they changed their approach, on the one hand, using diplomatic means to induce the British and American parties to make concessions, and on the other hand, using various pressures to expand their power. The British and American authorities and expatriates knew where the Japanese were using their minds. If the Japanese got their wish, the administration of the concession would not only be controlled by the Japanese, but the current situation of the concession would also be impossible to maintain. This move is of great importance. Dong Shanghai has become the last bulwark of their interests in China. If they are controlled by others, their lives and property will lose their guarantee. This is a must-win. As for the Chinese side, the emergence of the five Chinese directors has been produced through legal procedures and is on record, and cannot be changed by any party. Therefore, future developments can be highly valued.

### German Ship Remusas Stealthily Sailed to Yokohama Captain Frank Left on the Ship: The Task Borne Thereafter Must Be Piracy

The cargo ship Remusas of the German Hengbao Shipping Company, which runs the Europe-Asia route, after Germany declared war on Britain and France, when the ship arrived in Shanghai and originally intended to sail to Yokohama, it immediately berthed in the Huangpu River. It then obtained permission from the Japanese side and moved to the No. 1112 buoy in Gaochang Temple Shuizha, Nanshi, for a year and a half. It aimed to avoid the detention of the British fleet in China. When the ship was in Shanghai, it was said to have been repaired and the hull was painted. The deadweight was 4,899 tons and it was one of more than 20 cargo ships of the Hengbao Company. It decided to take advantage of the customs holiday to secretly leave Shanghai at 8:05 p.m. last Saturday and sail out of the Wusongkou. Whereabouts the company firmly refused to express, but all believed that the ship sailed to Yokohama, Japan. In addition to Captain Frank, who was carrying the ship, there were other original sailors of the ship, and no passengers were attached to the ship to leave. Subsequent whereabouts are worthy of attention, and the task borne must be piracy work.

### Da Zhong News Agency Was Bombed Yesterday; Qin Zhonghuan Injured in Right Foot

Da Zhong News Agency, located at 26 Hengye Lane, Edward Road, was suddenly bombed yesterday around 8 PM. At the time, employees were working when a black object was thrown in through the window. The employees rushed to escape, but Mr. Qin Zhonghuan was a bit slow and was injured in his right foot by the explosion. His foot bone was broken and he was bleeding heavily. The police were immediately notified and an ambulance was sent to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. Fortunately, his life is not in danger. In addition, two pieces of equipment were destroyed, and the employees were slightly frightened, but there were no other losses. The agency still issued dispatches as usual yesterday.

### Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank Announced Resumption of Business Yesterday, Publishing the Legal Exchange Rate and Balancing Tax; This Stabilizes Shanghai's Financial Situation

The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank on Albert Road and the office on Baker Road were forced to temporarily suspend business after being bombed on March 24. Now, the bombed building has been repaired and the internal organization has been completed. Yesterday, it was announced that business would officially resume, and all business would be handled as usual. All receipts and remittances of notes during the suspension period were handled yesterday upon resumption of business. In addition, the legal exchange rate was announced at 10:00 AM yesterday, which was one shilling and two and a half pence for the British exchange rate and thirty US dollars for the US exchange rate. The balancing tax rate was 24.5. Regarding the fifteenth payment of principal and interest on the long-term financial bonds of the Republic of China in 1928, discounting and payment began yesterday. The entire financial situation in Shanghai is becoming more stable because the four banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, continue to maintain operations, and all discounting and lending are handled as usual. Rumors in the speculative market have ceased, people are at peace, and the rumors of the four banks withdrawing have been proven inaccurate by the facts.

### It is Reported That the Public Works Department Has Decided to Control the Rice Market; Rice Price Evaluation Was Tacitly Abolished Yesterday

The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee recently received a letter from the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, stating that in the recent market situation, the prices in the black market have continued to increase, and there is no effective way to implement the evaluation. Rice merchants are facing difficulties in operating, and they requested to relieve the pain of the industry. At the end of last month, a meeting was convened to discuss the matter. It was generally agreed that the points mentioned by the association were true, and the original evaluation had long been ineffective. Not only did it cause the industry to suffer, but it also provided little benefit to the food supply of Shanghai. It was impossible to continue the work, and it was better to dissolve the committee than to delay and cause mistakes. After discussion, it was decided to report the reasons for the dissolution of the evaluation committee to the authorities. At the same time, the authorities were asked to come up with effective measures to stabilize the rice market and maintain the food supply. In this way, the evaluation of the last meeting has been tacitly abolished.

Authorities Responsible for Implementing Control

The Shanghai Times reported that a spokesperson for the Public Works Department stated yesterday (March 31) that the Public Works Department has decided to adopt a policy of controlling rice in order to indirectly control the rice market, in order to cope with the very important rice problem in the city's economy. According to this policy, the Public Works Department will cooperate with the French Concession Municipal Council to effectively control the rice supply, without directly interfering with rice price restrictions. Rice merchants must obtain rice from the authorities. To achieve this goal, the Bureau has set up a committee to manage the chartering of ships to transport rice. All members except one have been appointed, and their names will be announced in a day or two.

Chartering Committee Has Full Authority

This committee represents all sectors of the business community and has full authority. In the near future, we will see harmony and understanding between the authorities and concerted action to strictly control the rice supply, so that rice merchants cannot escape the supervision of the authorities and have to take into account the public interest. The spokesperson also disclosed detailed measures, stating that the Public Works Department will effectively monopolize the rice transported by British ships in order to control the rice shipped from Rangoon. The French Concession Municipal Council will also similarly control the rice shipped from Vietnam according to a parallel plan, and the establishment of public warehouses will cooperate with the Bureau's plan to handle the distribution of rice. Once the Bureau has complete control over the supply of rice, it can provide the public with sufficient protection without directly interfering with rice prices. Previously, the Bureau had to inquire with rice merchants to find out the original price of rice, but after the new method is implemented, the authorities will directly know the original price, freight and other items, and retail transactions will be absolutely controlled by the authorities. The Public Works Department's plan will also clearly stipulate the contractual obligations that rice merchants must bear, and those who violate the regulations will be punished by stopping the supply of rice and publishing their names.

Establishing Public Warehouses is Authorized by the Authorities

The public warehouse plan will be gradually implemented in the next few days, and it will become an important tool for allocating rice. The Public Works Department will announce this soon. The establishment of public warehouses is fully authorized by the authorities and is a cooperative group that acts as a liaison between the Bureau and rice merchants. Mr. He, the Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department, is in charge of the matter. Once the municipal authorities have complete jurisdiction over the rice supply, the chaotic rice market in Shanghai will be completely changed. Up to now, the authorities have lacked true control, which is the fundamental weakness. However, according to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," the details of the Public Works Department's plan to completely control the rice supply have been revealed, and Deputy Director-General He told reporters that he was unaware of this plan to control the rice supply.

Amount of Foreign Rice Imported in March

Recently, rice merchants have declared that the freight rate for Burmese rice has increased, but it has been found that there has been little Burmese rice arriving in Shanghai in the past, and most of it has been Vietnamese rice. Therefore, according to the current observations, even if the freight rate for Burmese rice increases, it will not be affected. It has been found that the amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai in March of this year was the largest of any month, totaling 687,410 bags, and there may be omissions. Among them, 341,621 bags were directly shipped from Saigon, 17,497 bags were directly shipped from Siam, 21,500 bags were directly shipped from Rangoon, and the remaining 306,792 bags were transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai. In January, a total of 539,266 bags arrived, and in February, a total of 479,798 bags arrived. The total amount for the three months combined was 1,706,474 bags. The amount smuggled out of the country is unknown.

### Less Than Two Thousand American Citizens in Shanghai

There are currently 1,900 American citizens and 500 Filipino citizens in the jurisdiction of the US Consulate in Shanghai. Although the evacuation of American citizens has slowed down significantly, many American citizens who have traveled to Shanghai are still returning to their countries on every ship leaving Shanghai for the United States. It was found that there were still 2,000 American citizens here on March 1, of which 100 had already departed that month, leaving 1,900 people. The number of people who departed from Shanghai in March was not just 100. The number in District 7 is only this.

### Spring Scenery

During these few days of spring vacation, the Gujiazhai Garden in the French Concession is crowded with tourists, men, women, old and young, shoulder to shoulder, all going to enjoy the nature in the man-made gardens. The best scenery in the garden is naturally the lake area. Although the lake is not wide, it is flat as a mirror. A gentle breeze blows, creating a thin layer of ripples, making people feel that this tender spring has rippled into everyone's hearts. (Photo by Kang Zuyi)

Rice Prices Soaring

Rice prices rose daily this month, and the situation became increasingly serious.

The average price per dan this month was 10 yuan, 27 cents, and 5 mils, compared to 8 yuan, 77 cents, and 5 mils in February, an increase of 17.09 percent.

Daily Commodity Prices

Among the 31 items in the food category, 22 items increased in price, accounting for 71 percent. Among the 7 items in the miscellaneous category, 6 items increased in price, accounting for 86 percent. Among the 6 items in the fuel category, 5 items increased in price, accounting for 83 percent. Among the 11 items in the clothing category, 9 items increased in price, accounting for 82 percent. In addition to rice and coal briquettes, the prices of other daily necessities, such as flour, tofu, and salt in the food category, increased by 25.02, 42.86, and 13.65 percent, respectively. In the miscellaneous category, the prices of items such as soap and boiled water increased by 51.71 and 25.00 percent, respectively. In the fuel category, the prices of items such as matches and kerosene increased by 44.04 and 16.30 percent, respectively. In the clothing category, the prices of items such as fine cloth and native cloth increased by 7.36 and 7.09 percent, respectively.

### British Royal Air Force Association Celebrates Anniversary; Banquet Held Last Night; British Ambassador Attends

The Shanghai British Royal Air Force Association held a banquet at the HSBC Building Clubhouse last night (April 1st) to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Royal Air Force and the 21st anniversary of the establishment of the Association in Shanghai.

### A Guide's Confession from Inside the Telephone

— Huang Ying

Forgive me for not recounting my life story, because a "guide's" life is not worth military consideration. If the gentlemen are in a good mood, I might even earn some cheap "pity." Otherwise, the gentlemen have plenty of money; when they want to have fun, they just "call" a guide to play with. Who wants to listen to your incessant complaining? If you want to be "noble," you should stay at home and be a pampered daughter! I was once loudly berated by a university student, a "son of a wealthy family," while he threw money in my face, even though I had also attended university... Alas, I won't say any more. Simply put, I am now a "guide."

I also don't need to hide what profession I'm engaged in under the "beautiful" name. In a script called "Night Shanghai," when a dancer tries to persuade a girl with a similar fate to mine, she says: We women have one last move, the most difficult and the easiest path – it's a woman's most primal capital, her most instinctive behavior! Is that dancer unscrupulous or shameless? I cannot say, dare not say, and cannot bear to say, because I am now walking this easiest and most difficult path!

Moreover, I have already understood the relationship between money and humiliation. Now, if I happen to encounter that university student, the "son of a wealthy family," again, I will definitely be able to abandon my "nobility" and become his most ideal temporary lover. Because I already possess all the qualities that enable a woman to please a man. I can even translate the most wonderful "love words" from foreign movies for him as "reference"!

I have fallen! I do not deny it.

Therefore, I don't want to discuss those headache-inducing "women's professions" in this article, or even a self-promotional "guide's introduction," because in the past year or two, I have read many articles that either sympathize with us or severely scold us, two absolutely opposite viewpoints. Regardless of whether "sympathy" or "scolding" is right or wrong, they all overlooked the complex factors that contribute to the abnormal development of guide companies. These complex factors – this "secret" – will hardly be conveyed from the telephone when you hold the receiver to "interview" us. Or, the result of the "interview" might even be the opposite of the truth. Gentlemen, forgive my bluntness.

For example, our good boss, whom we call "President," has a perpetually smiling, fat face, as lovable as the gold watch chain on his trousers. When he sees me, he always greets me with "Miss Huang, this" and "Miss Huang, that." If I happen to be sick for a couple of days, he will come to my house to inquire about my health like he's attending to his own mother. However, when he gets angry, my clumsy pen cannot describe it. Let me just give a factual example.

In the company, I am called "Hundred Flower Fairy." In the past, when the sisters were "one yuan per hour," my "value" was already "two yuan per hour" – now it's "four yuan per hour." Naturally, it's because the "President" "promoted" me. Because when I "took office," he saw that I wasn't bad-looking, so he instructed Mr. Zhang, who was in charge of answering the phone, to "promote" me in front of the "guests." For example, when a "guest" wants to call a certain number (we are numbered like criminals), he would first answer that number is "out on call," then say that there is a newly arrived Huang Ying, how and how she is. I can boast that unless someone is blind, any woman who embarks on this "path" only needs to be "promoted" to "shake up." The "President" then advances money to make clothes and jewelry for me... Thus, the title of "Hundred Flower Fairy" spread in restaurants and hotels. But there is a "conspiracy" hidden in this. I will forever be his "cash cow." Before his "advances" are repaid, I have no way to get out of "selling my body" – extending this for a year.

Probably like the "poaching" trend in the film industry, another "President" came to "negotiate" with me. He promised to repay the "advances" for me and offered many more favorable conditions. (I forgot to tell you a "secret" among the "Presidents." My starting as a guide was because a "matchmaker" saw my family's predicament and persuaded my mother. That "matchmaker" was a henchman of the "President." The person who came to "negotiate" naturally approached from my mother's side.) But this "deal" was immediately leaked, and I saw the President's true face for the first time.

When he called me into his bedroom, I felt like I was facing a "Seven Fiends" deity in a temple. He began to interrogate me, with the air of a robber forcing the victim to reveal where the silver safe key was hidden. I could only cry, but he choked my throat with his hand, only releasing me after I promised never to leave his "company."

Strangely, when he opened the door and let me out, he was again all smiles, "Miss Huang, this" and "Miss Huang, that," like the Buddha Maitreya.

His victory in "two-faced diplomacy" also meant that I fell into a sea of misery deeper than the eighteenth level of hell.

I have fallen, I do not deny it. But just as the rice weevils that hoard rice hold a public price leveling, before the exposure, both condemnation and sympathy, though starting from justice, are like shooting an arrow without a target!

The first guide company in Shanghai on Sichuan Road, the "Shanghai Guide Company," closed down because it was unwilling to go with the flow. Their boss probably knew the inside story of "guide companies" most clearly.

### Xia Dezhao, Manager of Huxi Yongsheng Fabric Factory, Was Kidnapped Yesterday. The Intended Target Was His Elder Brother Dexuan, Who Had Already Gone Out. Dezhao Was Abducted When He Came Out and His Whereabouts Are Unknown

Yesterday morning, a kidnapping occurred on Dunxin Road in Huxi. The kidnappers' original intention was to kidnap Xia Dexuan, the owner of Tongcheng Peppermint Factory, but they mistakenly kidnapped Xia Dezhao, the manager of Yongsheng Fabric Factory. The details of the case are as follows:

Dezhao Came Out and Was Immediately Abducted

Xia Dexuan, a native of Haimen, is 31 years old. He currently runs Tongcheng Peppermint Factory at Houjiaku, Haige Road. His younger brother, Dezhao, is 28 years old and is the current manager of Yongsheng Fabric Factory in Panjia Lane, Daxilu. The two brothers reside at No. 21, Yong'an New Village, Lane 94, Dunxin Road in Huxi. At 8:40 yesterday morning, after Dezhao finished breakfast, he was about to go out to the factory when four kidnappers suddenly broke in. Upon seeing Dezhao, they immediately asked if Xia Dexuan was at home. Because Xia suspected the people, he answered that he was not. Seeing his hesitation in answering, the kidnappers assumed he was Dezhao. They pulled out their guns, dragged him out, and forced him into Yunfei Taxi No. 12309, which was waiting at the entrance of the lane, and sped away.

Lost Car Found, Xia's Whereabouts Unknown

After the incident, Xia's family reported to the police and the "Special Police Department." Around 5:00 PM, the car was discovered at the entrance of Fu Yi Village on Columbia Road. The Special Police Department notified Yunfei to claim it. Before the incident occurred, Yunfei Taxi received a phone call instructing them to send a car to the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road. The company dispatched driver Zhang Xiuwen to drive car No. 12309. Upon arriving at the location, five bandits jumped in and instructed Zhang to drive to Yong'an New Village. When they reached the entrance of the village, the bandits ordered Zhang to drive into the alley. Zhang replied that the alley was too narrow to drive in. The bandits then revealed their ferocious intentions and dragged Zhang out of the car, pushing him into the kitchen shed of Xia's residence at No. 21. They monitored his movements with a gun. After Xia was abducted by the remaining bandits, the bandit released Zhang, got into the car together, and fled. The case is currently under investigation to determine Xia's whereabouts.

### Drug Dealer Zhou Hongye Shot Dead Yesterday, Shot in the Back and Died

Zhou Hongye, a native of Guangdong, was 36 years old and lived at No. 5, Lane 68, Limei Road in the French Concession. He previously worked at the Guangdong Daily newspaper on North Sichuan Road and currently sells morphine for a living. Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 4:00 PM, when Zhou Hongye was walking past No. 193 Huagene Road, a man suddenly emerged from the roadside and shot him in the back. The bullet did not penetrate. Zhou fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The assailant, seeing that his purpose was achieved, fled. Nearby Chinese police officers arrived after hearing the sound, but the assailant had already disappeared without a trace. They quickly summoned an ambulance to take Zhou Hongye to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 10:30 PM.

### Transfer of Chinese Deputy Detectives in Various Police Stations of the Public Concession

The Public Concession Municipal Council's Police Department issued an order the day before yesterday to transfer Yang Peisheng, the Chinese Deputy Detective of the Central Police Station, to the Putuo Road Police Station and Tang Zihong, the Chinese Deputy Detective of the Putuo Road Police Station, to the Central Police Station. Zhang Yuanjing, the Chinese Deputy Detective of the Old Gate Police Station, was transferred to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Tao Genrong, the Chinese Deputy Detective of the Gordon Road Police Station, was transferred to the Old Gate Police Station. Yao Yuanlong, the Chinese Deputy Detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, was transferred to the Hui Si Police Station. Zhu Mengwei, the Chinese Deputy Detective of the Hui Si Police Station, was transferred to the Gordon Road Police Station. The transferred Chinese Deputy Detectives have reported to their new posts and started working since yesterday morning.

### Theft from Store Leads to Arrest

Wang Zhuming, a clerk in the office of a Westerner named Mars Tailot at No. 4 Yuanmingyuan Road, secretly stole three typewriters, two calculators, and three bolts of cloth worth 6,000 yuan from the office on the night of the 29th of last month. He took the stolen goods to a gambling den to make a desperate gamble. Unexpectedly, Wang was out of luck and lost everything. Unable to make amends, he surrendered himself to the General Police Station yesterday, which ordered him to be detained. This morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Fang Fushu, the police lawyer, filed a lawsuit according to law. After questioning by Judge Dai, he was ordered to be detained for further review at a later date.

### Three Labor Disputes Remain Unresolved

After several contacts between labor and management, the employers of the Western-style clothing store and garment workers' strike have agreed to a general wage increase of 35%. However, the workers are determined not to resume work unless they reach their target of 40%. Opinions are gradually approaching. The Shanghai Electric News Company's dispatchers went on strike, and the employer has not yet responded to their demands. The authorities of the companies will re-employ a large number of White Russian reporters, and the labor dispute may be difficult to resolve for a while. In addition, all the workers in more than ten electrical knife grinding factories jointly announced a strike, putting forward seven conditions requesting the employer to agree. The main items are that the monthly wage should be at least 60 yuan.

### Birthday Celebrations for Xie Baosheng and His Wife

There will also be a Ping Opera performance to help liven up the event.

### Establishment of a Cemetery Protection Association at the International Cemetery

The International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road has been in a state of disrepair since the incident. The families of the deceased are heartbroken by what they see. As a result, a Cemetery Protection Committee was initiated and has been approved by the authorities and established. The office is located at No. 19 Wulin Lane, at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Datu Road. It is heard that the association is now starting to organize repairs and register burial households. As the Qingming Festival is approaching, many burial households are enthusiastically registering.

### The Grandeur of Xu Zhengbai's Painting Exhibition

Mr. Xu Zhengbai of Shugang is a senior figure in the calligraphy and painting circles. Yesterday, he exhibited more than a hundred of his recent works on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association. People in the literary and art circles rushed to make reservations. Mr. Xu also has many famous paintings by Song and Yuan masters, including a vertical scroll of "Returning Boats in Wind and Rain" by Xia Gui of the Song Dynasty and a long scroll of "Pine and Rock" by Wu Zhonggui of the Yuan Dynasty, which are considered rare treasures. Those who appreciate art are very willing to acquire them and use the proceeds to create a fund for the establishment of free primary and secondary schools. It is heard that the exhibition will last for another five days, and all circles are welcome to visit.

### Jack Lally Temporarily Imprisoned in Ward Road Prison After Sentencing, May Be Deported to the United States on the Next President Ship, Three Women's Attempts to Meet Mr. Jack Were Not Approved

The English-language Greater America Evening Post stated that "Slot Machine King" Jack Lally was convicted of running a palace gambling crime and has been sentenced by the American Press Department to be sent back to McNeil Island Prison in the United States for an 18-month sentence. He is currently temporarily detained in Ward Road Prison.

This morning (2nd), two Russian women and one Swedish woman, who are overseas Chinese in Shanghai, went to the office of the Executive Officer of the American Press Department one after another, requesting permission to go to Ward Road Prison to meet Mr. Jack to thank him for his kindness in helping the poor. However, the American Executive Officer refused because they were neither relatives of Mr. Jack nor had any special matters. The three women then said that they wanted to write a letter to Mr. Jack to thank him, and the American Executive Officer agreed to forward it. According to an official, when Mr. Jack boards the ship to return to the United States, he will be allowed to meet with journalists because Mr. Jack still has a few words to say.

Spring and Autumn

### "Let's Talk Later" vs. "Who Cares"

— Hongshui

Finally got a thin pancake for breakfast, but where will the rice for dinner come from? (Please don't mention lunch) Helplessly, the "poor guy" sighs: "Let's talk later"!

Hoard rice today, hoard coal tomorrow, hoard as much as you can; if you don't have it, of course, "sell it at the highest price"! Therefore, the market is chaotic, and the citizens are in dire straits; the "popular" "good guys" curse "Who cares"!

Those who "don't care" will only continue to "not care," and those who say "let's talk later" can't continue to "talk later," a hungry belly is "real life"! People are, after all, "alive," so why not "open the skylight," who is afraid of death, who doesn't want to live?

We are all human, so why can you curse "who cares," while I sigh "let's talk later"? Therefore, rather than "this way," it's better to "that way"! ... From this perspective, those who "don't care" also need to "care about themselves"! Those who say "let's talk later" will inevitably "talk later" ... (Talk about what? Those who "don't care" know it very well!) That day will come!

### "High" and "Low"

— Zhong Zimang

There are two children, one who goes to a so-called "lane primary school," and one who goes to a school on the fourth floor of a tall department store.

That "lane primary school" is a two-story house. The living room serves as the "first classroom." The small courtyard has a glass roof. The wall has a bulletin board, which shows students' grades. The courtyard has a rocking horse, which is the only toy for the kindergarten students. There are two rooms on the side made of wooden boards. One is the "second classroom" and the other is the "office." The situation below is roughly like this. Upstairs, the main room is of course the "third classroom," and the side rooms upstairs have become the residence of the head teacher and his wife. Early-arriving elementary school students can admire the "charm" of the head teacher's wife grooming herself in the mirror, which is a scenic line of this small school!

And it's actually a complete six-year primary school system. Two grades are combined into one classroom; and including the "kindergarten" in the courtyard, it can be said that "the sparrow is small but has all the vital organs."

After this child entered this school, he somehow became thinner. At least he lost the rosy complexion he had when he came from the countryside. He also learned the cunning of the city. He wasn't familiar with this environment at first, but after a month, we could see this child fighting in the "lane playground," with "fuck" in his mouth and wild movements. He also learned some "terms" like "thirteen yuan and six jiao." His schoolbag rolled on the ground, a hand black with charcoal held roasted squid with soy sauce, and then they drank and played a drinking game. His hands were so busy. After school, this child and his "classmates" crowded at small bookstalls to compete to read "Emerald Green" and "Arsène Lupin" comic books. Sometimes they kicked a leather ball in the middle of the road. Suddenly, a car came, and they hurried to the sidewalk. They almost became ghosts under the wheels, which made them laugh. This child lives in this school that has no gaps and is full of dirty air.

There is also a child who studies in a building. His father is a gentry who escaped from the countryside, so his family is much better than the child who studies in the lane primary school. He chose this aristocratic school and used a streetcar pass and a lunch fee of one yuan a day to let his son receive this "noble" primary school education.

This building is of course steel and concrete, with an elevator. And white light bulbs are burning all day long. This school is on the fourth floor, with wide classrooms and tidy desks and chairs ... the desks have inkwells and the chairs have buttock prints, as if there is a range for students to sit in.

However, this child asked his father to make a suit and buy leather shoes. He also paid attention to beauty, but he also somehow became thinner.

The use of one yuan a day seems to be not enough, because he has to "treat." There is often an ice cream and toast shop downstairs, and they are bound to go there like a swarm of bees; upstairs is an ice-skating rink, and the young master also patronized it, and the encouragement of the school teacher also made it a regular "exercise"; on the top floor there is also a dance hall, which this child and his friends often feel is a mysterious place, often peeking secretly, influenced by what he saw and heard, although he did not participate, he seemed to be familiar with everything like a little boy.

### Thrift

— Zi Wu

Thief A: Hey! Whose house is this?

Thief B: This is the house of Wang Er, who sells his fists.

Thief A: If we get caught by them, we can't stand being beaten up.

Thief B: Don't worry! If we get caught by him, he won't hit you. He only punches when someone gives him money!

### Today is Sunday

— Hong

"Sunday" brings people a little "joy," but I don't know why I always feel "annoyed."

It's hard to collect a little money, and I'm still thinking in my heart: "How" can I get the money to look like I'm "experienced," there are many "thieves" outside!

"Half-day leave on Sunday as usual"

Damn, when I got back to the store, the manager was smoking a cigar happily, not caring at all:

"I forgot. ... Go again in the afternoon!"

Once, it was probably also "Sunday," I walked past a certain road and casually looked at a friend. It was difficult to knock open the tightly closed double black lacquered doors, but unexpectedly I bumped into a nose ...

"Who are you looking for? Today is "Sunday"!"

"Oh ... oh ... how ..." I was too busy to "consider" the so-called "Sunday," and I was eager to be dazed.

"Gone to the movie theater long ago!" Then "bump".

Alas, I didn't even "think" about it myself, what day is it today! I really don't even have this "common sense," I can walk a lot of unnecessary roads.

What is "joyful"? For example, a lot! Open the newspaper: "Extra early show on Sunday," "Five special screenings today on Sunday" "Today is Sunday, extra singing of daytime plays, annoying double roles, special highlights, awesome!"

If it's a little more exciting: "Sunday tea dance, no admission fee, extra special programs, old-fashioned all-nighters."

If you run outside and stand in front of the majestic door with a cross, you might hear an innocent child: "Mom, can Jesus really save people?"

So, those who think it's "joyful" will never forget which Sunday is tomorrow? As for me, I will have to "pay attention" even more in the future, I can't but care greatly, today is "Sunday"!

### "Hypocrisy"

— Xiao Feng

Recently, besides "Today the Weather Ha Ha Ha," I have discovered some more "patterned" pleasantries. Perhaps others have already heard them over and over again, but I do feel that they are novel.

Two old friends met on the road, and at the beginning they said in unison: "How are you!"

Or: "Are you busy?"

The answers are all: "Thank you, thank you, not busy, not busy, nothing going on!"

Although, in fact, they might be "extremely busy."

Also, when talking about life, everyone frowns, "It's really terrible!" As if they really can't make it; in fact, they had just hoarded thousands of bags of rice a minute ago.

However, later, after I summarized these things one by one, it seemed that I had found a rule, and this rule was copied:

"Hypocrisy!"

This is terrible plagiarism!

(6) Product of Love

The day after Qiu Haitang returned, he received an express letter from Tianjin. Although in his own mind, this letter was almost a family letter, unfortunately, his close friend Yuan Shaowen happened to be sitting on a sofa opposite him when the letter was delivered. The distance between them was no more than four or five steps, which made it impossible for him to hide the letter temporarily, and at the same time, he tried his best to calm his mind so as not to reveal his excited emotions.

"Express letter, who sent it to you?" Shaowen asked gently, holding a cigarette, but it was not an interrogation, just a kind of concern that is common among close friends.

In the past few years, Qiu Haitang had never told him a single lie, and now it almost made him panic.

"It... it was Yu Kun who sent it." An easy excuse occurred to him.

Shaowen put down the newspaper in his hand and smiled slightly.

"That fellow is quite tough! He hurt you because he beat someone, so he won't come here easily; in fact, what's the estrangement between old brothers since childhood?" He glanced at the clock on the wall and immediately stood up. "Hurry up, isn't Uncle Yi asking us to have dinner today? It's almost twelve o'clock now, we have to leave if we want to go!"

Qiu Haitang's face suddenly turned half red. He almost didn't have the courage to see Yuan Baofan again.

"Why don't you go first?" He stammered, "Zhao Si still has some things to discuss with me in a while... But at most half an hour, I will definitely be there too. Please go ahead?"

Shaowen took his woolen hat from the hanger and looked at him with great surprise, unable to figure out why Qiu Haitang was so distraught, as if he still had something on his mind that he couldn't let go of. He took a step forward and said with a very sincere attitude:

"If there's anything, you might as well tell me and let me listen. Why bother sulking alone?" (70)

### Cannibalism Amidst Famine in Yuyao

— Huang Yuqi

The disaster began two years ago. Deaths have followed one after another, a tragic scene that defies description. All the nouns that can be used to describe a disaster have already appeared in reality. Recently, I learned with great pain that a tragedy of a younger brother eating his elder brother's corpse occurred in the Zhang family in the Tao Mountain area of ​​Yuyao, which is truly a rare event in history and a tragic event in the world. The Zhang family has three brothers. The eldest, named Xiaowen, who was over fifty years old, just passed away on December 28th of last year. He was hastily buried. On the sixth day of the first month of this year, the second and youngest brothers, because they were hungry and had nothing to eat, actually split open their elder brother's coffin, took out the corpse, and steamed it for food. They were arrested afterwards. It is also said that both younger brothers had studied and were not comparable to fools. On the day of the court hearing, they begged the enforcers not to execute them by shooting, but to quickly drown them, so as to save bullets, etc. The implication behind the words is even more worthy of recollection.

Nuclear war between similar countries is called endurance, fratricide is called violence, but now compatriots are eating each other, and even harming the remains of the dead. Alas, having written this, I cannot continue writing! When they split the coffin and steamed the corpse, seeing the gaunt white bones before their eyes, the deceased, who is under the ground, must have suffered all kinds of hardships in his life, and finally starved to death. What does it taste like for the younger brother to eat it, and how can he bear it in his heart? But with a rumbling stomach and burning hunger, they do not know that there is still filial piety, brotherly love, benevolence, and love in the world. Alas, who doesn't have brothers like arms and legs, which can be eaten, let alone humanity. Who caused this, whose fault is it?

Wang Julao and other fellow villagers of Yuyao in Shanghai have remitted 100,000 yuan in this disaster to carry out relief, but it is a drop in the bucket and does not help. Even we small people have written articles several times, imitating Jiang Bo's call, but in the end, the disaster is so severe and the disaster area is so vast that relief cannot be popularized. At this time, when there is no way to beg and no way to ask for donations, a rare famine has occurred in our hometown, and such a tragic event has been discovered again. If relief is not provided urgently, the future disasters may be ten or a hundred times worse than today. The environment is like this, what else can be said! I hope that our rich and wealthy people in Shanghai, while living in luxury, do not forget the pain of eating corpses to fill their stomachs, develop their compassionate hearts, and save these people waiting to be fed. (In response to moving the Yuyao disaster)

### Xin Yanqiu to Marry Ma Shaoxiang

— Weiwei

(Beiguo Chrysanthemum News) Xin Yanqiu has only quietly returned to the north recently after being hired by the Golden Grand Theater last year to perform in the south. It is said that there is a reason why the new actress has been late in returning. It turns out that the new actress has found a partner on this trip and will give up her singing career to become a good woman. However, although the new actress has created this marriage because of her trip to the south, her partner is a northern amateur actor, whose surname is Ma and given name is Shaoxiang. He is a disciple of the famous actor Zhang Chunyan, specializing in the old male role, and has not yet entered the professional stage. When the new actress came to the south last time, Ma was familiar with the person who invited actors to the Golden Theater, so he came to Shanghai on the same boat with Xin Yanqiu and others. Unexpectedly, this small process led to an ambiguous relationship. The two have been living together in Shanghai for a long time. Xin Yanqiu has had bad luck in recent years and has been quite frustrated. Now that she has found a home, it is also a consolation.

Ji Yuliang is Not a Drama School Student

The Ruyi Society, which is investing in this performance, is called the "Beijing Opera School Graduates Troupe," but in fact, the people in it are not all drama school students. For example, the old male role actor Ji Yuliang is one of them. Ji Yuliang's original name was Ji Yingnan. He used to work on the Beijing-Ning Road train. Because he loved drama, he entered the professional stage. This time, when the Ruyi Society went south, the old male role was originally Zhao Jinnian from the drama school. Zhao could not go for some reason, so Li Yuru temporarily pulled in Ji Yingfu to go with him. Because it was under the name of the "Beijing Opera School Graduates Troupe," Ji Yingfu's name had to be changed to the ranking of "Dehe Jinyu" to show uniformity. Therefore, Ji Yingfu changed his name to Ji Yuliang. (In a certain year, when the graduates troupe of the Fuliancheng Sheng generation came to Shanghai to perform on the Tianchan Stage, the painted face actor Wang Quankui was not a Fuliancheng student, so he changed his name to Wang Shengkui to show uniformity. The change of Ji Yingfu's name is probably also based on the previous example.) People in Shanghai don't know and still think he is also a graduate of the opera school?

### The Creation of a Singing Voice

Diana Durbin's Singing Secrets

Since Universal discovered Diana Durbin, it has been stirring up the film industry to this day. Every movie fan has expressed unanimous liking for her, especially her singing voice, which is really too intoxicating. However, people generally only admire her success, but they don't know that she has spent endless hard work in practice. Here is her experience:

"The key to learning to sing is to give it life, but singing itself should still be simple." This is the most important thing I learned from my teacher Ferdinand Torriani. I followed him for two years before he died. After that, I learned from his friend Adele Newell for many years. He taught me to open my mouth, which is often not paid attention to by ordinary teachers, or even if they teach it, students cannot pay enough attention to it.

Next, I want to tell you about practicing chewing, paying attention not to let the lips cover the teeth, and trying to open the mouth as much as possible. When chewing, use force to separate the gums. This way, people can't see your throat, because the tongue is not lying flat in the mouth, and the activity of the flesh below has raised it. Eliminating the resistance of the flesh at the throat is the secret to obtaining the correct sound.

This is the true Italian method before it was mixed with modern methods. The Italians of the old days were quite knowledgeable about the free vibration of the bottom of the sound. In other words, the breath passing through the lungs on the vocal cords should not have any muscular resistance on its way to the palate, which would strengthen the vibration. Therefore, before developing breathing ability, one should study the elimination of muscular resistance in the mouth.

Breathing is very natural, and its excessive development is also very dangerous. This excessive development causes the breath to exceed the capacity of the vocal organs, and its result must be muscle contraction, because instead of eliminating muscle action, it makes it even more developed. The first thing that should be controlled is not the source of breathing, but its outlet. To make the tone crisp, various resistances must be eliminated until there is a channel through which vibration can flow smoothly. This can only be achieved through slow and careful practice.

Finally, I want to talk about tone. Tone is the result of jaw movement. Without movement, it cannot be analyzed in detail. The opening and closing of the mouth must be forceful and rapid, just like every step in dancing has its special position, and every word also has its fixed position. Two words must not be mixed together, and the movements of each word are separate. At the same time, singing is an art of individual creation. To intelligently understand the art of the poet or composer, one must accept it with one's whole heart.

In short, don't forget to give life to singing, and sooner or later you will realize your beautiful dream.

Chapter 4 The Swallow Kicks the Flying Flowers and Falls on the Dance Mat

Li Xin still wanted to give the silver to them. Tong Tianbao smiled and said, "We don't accept rewards for no merit. Keep it, Master Li." One person then bid farewell to Li Xin with his companions and walked out of Li's Manor. After Li Xin watched them leave, he stood blankly in front of the manor gate for a long time before slowly pacing inside. His wife asked him about the inexplicable origins of the bandits, but he vaguely refused to tell her directly. At night, sleeping in bed, he thought about this matter, and his heart was very uneasy. He closed his eyes, and it seemed as if a Red Maiden with a light body like a swallow and a beautiful face like a flower was standing in front of him. He thought to himself that their words were not without reason, but he was a descendant of a prestigious family, how could he have such improper thoughts? Moreover, the victor is king, and the loser is a bandit. The future is unpredictable. Huang Chao of the Tang and Song dynasties also rebelled in anger after failing the imperial examination. However, the result was only to create opportunities for others, leaving himself with a bad name and slaughtering many innocent people. One wrong thought led to this. How could I rashly agree to them? After thinking for a while, he thought of Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei. They were going to join the army in Ningyuan and could fight against the Tartars in the customs and establish some miraculous feats. After thinking for a long time, he finally fell asleep. The next day, he went to Xu Jing's house and told him about this matter behind people's backs. Xu Jing was extremely surprised and said, "Their tone is very big. They will definitely rebel soon. The present time is a chaotic world. Since we are unwilling to be treacherous heroes in a chaotic world, can we be capable ministers in a peaceful world? I don't know how our seven-foot bodies will end up in the future? At this time, whining and chirping are of course useless. No wonder the ancients wanted to abandon their pens and join the army. Although I have this ambition, I have an old mother at home and cannot fulfill my wish, so I watched Zhang Cangqiu and others leave." Li Xin was speechless after hearing this. From then on, the two people's hearts were no longer at peace. And at that time, the overall situation became more and more chaotic day by day. The roaming bandits in Shaanxi became increasingly rampant, fleeing east and west, rising and falling, and although there were government troops, they could do nothing about them, like weeds that are difficult to eradicate, festering everywhere. The people in Henan were also panicked and could not live in peace. One day, Li Xin was drinking alone in his manor to pass the time when someone suddenly came to report that the female bandit Red Maiden of Qingstone Mountain and her subordinates had risen up and rebelled, and had burned and slaughtered many neighboring villages. Li Xin's heart could not help but stir when he heard this. (End of Chapter 4)

### A Fighting Philosophy of Life

— Zong Yu

Ignoring difficulties, unafraid of danger, heroic emotions, overcoming everything, fighting wholeheartedly with the bad environment, this is called being able to seize; having a normal mind, a normal attitude, and knowing how to regulate the spirit, there is always a time in the day when the mind is empty and flexible, seeking some happiness, this is called being able to let go. Being able to seize and being able to let go, the struggle can be sustained.

### Drama News

— Jue Xin

Gou Huisheng has been performing at the Golden Grand Theater for ten days since his debut. The box office results are always guaranteed because they are all "long-term subscribers," so there is never a problem with a full house. His performance period is twenty-four days and will not continue after the 13th.

The New Stage authorities are currently preparing all the arrangements for Hui Sheng's performance. The night before last, Dong Zhaobin and Huang Yuqi hosted a banquet for Hui Sheng. Li Shaoting and Bai Dang's generals E Lvgong, Shu Sheyu, Yang Cao Cao, etc., decided at the banquet that Hui Sheng would rest for two days after the expiration of his contract at the Golden Theater and would definitely perform at the New Stage in Shanghai on the 16th. The highest ticket price will still be seven yuan, and the opening play is still under discussion.

Before Hui Sheng arrived in Shanghai, everyone was saying that he was very fat, but after meeting him this time, I felt that he was elegant and charming, far from being comparable to Cheng Yanqiu. According to She Yu, when Hui Sheng arrived in Shanghai on the first day, he called him and the first sentence he said was, "I'm not fat!" This is also an interesting anecdote.

### "You Can't Take It With You"

Two years ago, there was a Western film in Shanghai that was well received at the time. This was "You Can't Take It With You," which was selected as one of the ten major films of 1938. "You Can't Take It With You" is a social satire that tells the story of two different families, one pursuing the joy of life and the other pursuing money. Those who pursue money are everywhere making profits at the expense of others, only to realize that one should enjoy some fun in life.

The original authors, Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman, are two famous American playwrights. This work won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Soon, Columbia Pictures obtained the film production rights for "You Can't Take It With You," directed by Frank Capra and starring the big stars James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Edward Arnold, and Lionel Barrymore. The greatness of this film lies in giving people extremely deep emotional agitation. The "You Can't Take It With You" adapted from the script with contrasting elements was adapted by the young playwright Chen Li (an unfamiliar name, but he is a familiar person to the public) and directed by Zhou Chu. "You Can't Take It With You" hopes to give a little stimulus to the "big merchants" who benefit themselves at the expense of others.
