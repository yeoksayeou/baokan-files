### The Eve of Napoleon's Failure to Attack Russia; Soviet Soldiers Fiercely Resist the German Army; Three Villages in Poland Occupied by Germany; Soviet Batteries in the Black Sea Bomb German-Romanian Fleets

Associated Press, London, 23rd. Today is the 125th anniversary of Napoleon's failure to attack Russia. In a 1,700-mile-long area from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, 4 million soldiers, aided by tanks, airplanes, and various new-style killing weapons, are engaged in battle. The German army has launched the largest army and mechanized force in history, attacking the Soviet Union in four routes. Due to the lack of official detailed reports, the exact situation remains unclear. However, the first route, led by German bombers and tanks, seems to be advancing from Karelia, with Leningrad as its target. The second route is advancing from East Prussia, and the third route is departing from Poland. The second and third routes both have Moscow as their target. The fourth route is departing from Romania, with the ultimate goal of capturing Ukraine and the Caucasus. Its immediate goal is to capture Kyiv and Odessa. According to various sources, the Soviet army has been fighting hard in front of the first three routes, but for strategic reasons, it has retreated along the front line of the fourth route to the old Soviet border along the Dniester River. Currently, the Soviet army is preparing to establish a strong position in this area, and the enemy forces are also arriving in this area one after another. The front line of the fourth route seems to become a main battlefield. People here believe that Hitler's army may first occupy Ukraine and the Caucasus, and then advance south through Iran, Iraq, and Syria, heading straight for the Suez Canal, to avoid the need to fight the British Mediterranean Fleet. Military commentators here say that Hitler must make strenuous efforts to advance and quickly move south. Otherwise, if the Soviet Union can hold Ukraine and the Caucasus for more than three months, Hitler will inevitably fail. The current German-Soviet war contains the following identical factors: (1) the number of German troops known to the public, and the number of Soviet troops is impossible to know; (2) the Germans are in urgent need of conquering oil-producing areas to obtain oil supplies. According to estimates, the oil currently stored by the Germans, if there is no further supply, can only supply three months of large-scale warfare; (3) the Germans are accustomed to summer conditions, while the Russians are accustomed to winter conditions; (4) use blitzkrieg tactics of quick victory to deal with a vast battlefield and a durable resistance. Based on the above four reasons, if the Germans cannot win within a month, they will definitely fail. The German-Soviet war, just the distance from the Soviet border to Moscow once, can show the difficulty. The Soviet border is 600 miles from Moscow. With such a long distance, Germany's military transportation lines will inevitably be extended, and its mechanized force will also need repairs. Military commentators also pointed out that the oil fields in Romania are now one of the important gasoline sources for the Germans. Soviet planes bombed the oil fields today.

Associated Press, Berlin, 23rd. The German army and air force, assisted by the Finnish and Romanian armies, broke through the Soviet border yesterday along a 1,500-mile-long war front and invaded its territory. According to observers' predictions, this battle can be concluded within eight weeks. The official did not disclose the situation of the German army's concentration, but it is known that Germany has deployed countless troops. In Hitler's declaration, it is estimated that the Soviet Union resisted the German, Finnish, and Romanian coalition forces with 160 divisions of the Red Army, 2.5 million people. Hitler did not announce the number of German troops, only saying that it was the largest army in history. In addition, former Chief Commander General Walter informed Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, estimating that the Soviet front-line force included 118 infantry divisions, 20 cavalry divisions, and 40 mechanized divisions. Also, Lieutenant General Jodl informed the German Foreign Ministry that there were four Soviet army groups with a total of 49 divisions, including a mechanized division, concentrated in East Prussia and south-east of Brest-Litovsk, with 2,000 Soviet aircraft. All day on Sunday, the German headquarters released very little information about the war, in line with its usual principle of not releasing news of battles unless there is a major victory, while the propaganda department often made wireless reports, saying how the German air force destroyed Soviet airfields and mechanized units, etc., and how the German infantry marched through the hot and dusty Poland to attack the Soviet border.

Havas, Vichy, 22nd. Military observers claim that the Soviet army concentrated along the Soviet-German border consists of 90 infantry divisions, 32 cavalry divisions, and 50 tank units, with 9,000 tanks. The German attack on the Soviet Union has long been concentrated on the route attacking the city of Kharkov in the Ukrainian Republic. Germany has been preparing to invade the Soviet Union for a long time, and the geographical situation of the Ukrainian Republic makes it quite possible for Germany to succeed. If the Red Army cannot fight a decisive battle with the German army in the area along the German-Soviet border, it should withdraw to the city of Sverdlovsk east of the Ural Mountains to prepare for a protracted war. In addition, the German army will simultaneously launch an offensive against the Baltic coast, attempting to attack the Moscow region from two directions. From the Soviet side, whether in terms of military strategy or tactics, the German offensive was expected. Although the Red Army cannot be compared with the German army in terms of quantity, its equipment is completely comparable. Since 1939, the Soviet Union has implemented partial mobilization, and the number of troops has been increasing every day. Those who have completed their term of service are also asked to stay. The German and Soviet sides are evenly matched, and it is difficult to predict who will win in the future.

Reuters, London, 23rd. The news from both Moscow and Berlin regarding the development of the Soviet-German war is limited to naval and air force activities. The situation of the two armies facing each other in eastern Poland, Finland, and Romania is still unclear. Romania announced that it has occupied two cities formerly belonging to its territory but now occupied by the Soviet Union. Another report said that the war is currently taking place on the Soviet-Finnish border, but there is no news about the development of the large army concentrated in the central region.

Soviet Communiqué Reports Heavy Damage to German Army; 65 German Aircraft Shot Down

TASS, Moscow, 23rd. The Red Army Command issued a communiqué on June 22, 1941, stating that at dawn on June 22, the German army attacked our troops from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. In the first half of the day, our army prevented the enemy from advancing. In the second half of the day, the German army encountered the forward units of the Red Army, and fierce fighting broke out. The enemy suffered heavy losses and was repelled. Only in the direction of Grodno and Kostinopol did the enemy achieve insignificant tactical achievements, occupying the small towns of Kalvarija, Stojanov, and Dehonavichy. The former two are five kilometers from the border, and the latter city is ten kilometers from the border. The enemy's air force attacked our airfields and densely populated areas, but each place was met with resolute resistance from our soldiers and anti-aircraft guns, suffering heavy damage. As a result, 65 enemy aircraft were shot down.

Reuters, Moscow, 23rd. The first war communiqué issued here this morning stated that yesterday morning the German army attacked the Soviet border along the entire front line from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, but were all blocked by the Soviet army. The enemy army retreated after stubborn fighting, suffering heavy losses, and only occupied three villages in the Soviet-occupied Poland, 10 to 15 miles from the border. The German army is now crossing the Soviet-German dividing line marked by the Bug River.

Reuters, Berlin, 23rd. A German infantry team, under the cover of artillery fire, crossed the Bug River in five minutes and arrived at a certain stronghold. This is the news broadcast by German radio last night. Then a German battalion also crossed the river in an instant and entered the forest on the opposite bank. At that time, German engineers took rubber boats along the small bridge to cross to the opposite bank. The first batch of infantry continued to carry machine guns and ammunition boxes to the opposite bank to set up machine gun positions to prevent the enemy from attacking.

Havas, Somewhere on the Soviet-German border, 22nd. According to German military reporters, at 3:06 a.m. today, the German army concentrated in the area along the East Prussian-Soviet border was ordered to invade the Soviet Union, and immediately drove through the open space, removed barbed wire and other obstacles, and soon arrived at the Soviet battery. This battery was not made of cement and steel, but of wooden blocks. Under the cover of artillery fire, the German army bombarded the Soviet battery. Although the Soviet defenders resisted bravely, the first line of the battery had been occupied by the German army, and then the Red Army's barracks were also occupied.

Reuters, Berlin, 23rd. The German war report this afternoon stated that the German army attacking the Red Army on the Eastern Front is advancing according to plan. In the Black Sea, the German-Romanian fleet was shelled by Soviet coastal batteries, but did not hit. Three warships were patrolling and scouting, gaining quite a lot.

Associated Press, Berlin, 23rd. The German High Command announced that on the first day of the war, the German army had advanced according to the planned plan, encountering only very weak resistance from the Red Army. It also stated that the German army in some areas on the Polish front is encountering very strong resistance from the Red Army artillery, which is deeply entrenched in excellent defensive lines. It is now bombarding the various units of the advancing German armored divisions. It is rumored that the Soviet infantry in Poland can also contain the German blitzkrieg.

Reuters, Stockholm, 23rd. According to Berlin, the German army has invaded 100 kilometers into Soviet territory, but the place names have not been announced. It is said that Brest-Litovsk and Bialystok have fallen into the hands of the German army. It is expected that the German's purpose is not to occupy all of the Soviet territory, but only to cut off the Soviet Union's connection with the Baltic Sea and occupy Ukraine and southern Soviet Union, including the Caucasus oil fields.

German Air Force Attacks Soviet Seaports; Soviet Planes Bomb East Prussia

Reuters, Berlin, 23rd. It was learned from responsible sources that German planes bombed the Soviet naval port of Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula yesterday, and many important military targets were hit.

Reuters, London, 23rd. According to unconfirmed news received here today, Odessa, one of the main commercial centers in southern Soviet Union and an important commercial port in the Black Sea, was bombed by German planes. The city has a population of over 600,000. The German planes, which bombed in batches, all came from Romanian territory. Other news said that Kyiv, Kharkov, Sevastopol, and Minsk were also attacked by German planes.

Reuters, Berlin, 23rd. According to wireless news received here last night, German planes bombed airfields across the Bug River, and 60 Soviet planes were shot down or destroyed on the ground.

Reuters, Berlin, 23rd. According to a report from the war correspondent of "Herbin" who participated in the bombing of the Soviet auxiliary airfield, the German plane destroyed many Soviet planes on the ground during the attack. At one o'clock yesterday morning, the German "Junkers" fleet, led by the commander's plane, set off for the Soviet border. At three o'clock in the morning, it arrived at the border, and long lines of troops on the ground also crossed into Soviet territory. The German artillery had attacked the Soviet army's positions to prepare for the infantry attack. Our planes drove straight in without encountering any resistance. It was not until 50 kilometers from the border that Soviet anti-aircraft guns opened fire, but they were far away from our planes. Soon, our planes discovered the enemy's airfield behind the forest, and the bombs rained down. Enemy planes, dormitories, hangars, and barracks on the ground were all hit and caught fire.

Editorial

### What Compensation Will General Life Receive?

Public utilities - If revenue and expenditure are not balanced, to maintain their profit, they can increase prices, regardless of the public's well-being. Public expenditure expands, and income is insufficient. To protect their original treatment, they can increase taxes, regardless of the burden. Hoarders - To compensate for the cost of warehousing and interest, they can spread rumors to raise prices, regardless of supply and demand or the suffering of the public. Everything else rises like water, one layer on top of another. The final destination, the ultimate burden, still falls on the general public, who are haggard and groan under the unbearable burden of life. Then, what compensation will these people receive to offset the continuous stream of heavy burdens? Someone may say that it is not difficult. They can seek compensation from their employers or their service organizations. There are subsidies for rice, subsidies for coal, subsidies for rent, and even subsidies for gasoline. With these subsidies, they can offset the heavy burdens. Their life is as comfortable as before, and their extravagant enjoyment is as usual. Why worry about rising prices? But I don't know how many employees in Shanghai can enjoy these subsidies. This is only possible with very generous treatment. Most employees suffer from huge expenses and sluggish business due to their own profession. If employees make various demands and employers are unable to meet them, they will resort to layoffs, dismissals, business closures, and sales. If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to? It will be impossible to maintain the original life, let alone improve it. Even if the demands are met, the amount of the subsidy is far less than the huge and rapid rise in prices. Moreover, the increased wages are often passed on to the price of goods to compensate, and the price rises again, in a cycle. This will make the maintenance of general life an unsolvable problem. Indeed, to solve the price problem in the current situation is indeed less possible. Even if it can be done, it takes a lot of effort and little success, and the benefit to general life is only small. Then, should we give up on trying to find a solution because there is no solution? That is not right either. In general, we can only seek compensation from the maintenance of the public and the conscience of the hoarders, such as

(1) The Price Stabilization Committee has been established. It is hoped that it will make overall plans on finance, finance, trade, and the people's livelihood, find a strong basis, and use it as a standard for foreign exchange so that prices will not fluctuate due to the influence of currency values in the future.

(2) It is hoped that all parties will not take any actions to stimulate prices. In particular, every move of the public should be concerned about the people's livelihood. Even if it cannot reduce the current burden, it should not increase the general burden. It is harmless for those who have the ability to bear the burden to bear more, and those who do not have the ability to bear the burden should be eased their burden to relieve their difficulties. For example, the entertainment of nightlife, although expensive, is still like ants clinging to it. Although electricity is called for in terms of energy saving, the neon lights are dazzling. These are all taking more without harming integrity or hurting the people. What harm is there in more? As for what the public needs and what public affairs use, an increase will universally increase the burden of general life, directly stimulate prices to rise, and is not the way to save and love the people. However, talking about saving and loving the people today is also a detour.

(3) Those who have idle capital and hoard goods for profit should show some conscience and no longer seek profit from prices everywhere. To advise people not to hoard is impossible. It is tantamount to asking a tiger for its skin. To advise people to take less profit is useless, as they will take it if they can. Moreover, the role of hoarding, from its advantages, is to use people's psychology of speculation and profit-making to store up more goods for emergencies. From its disadvantages, it disregards everything and seeks only huge profits, harming people to achieve its goals, and is a great pest of mankind. Therefore, denying the impropriety of hoarding is blind to the facts. If it is believed that business is free and is allowed to do whatever it wants, it will also harm the people's livelihood. For example, rice and grain are for-profit businesses, which is of course the case, but it must be raised and risen, rising several dollars a day, and used as a tool for speculation, which is unacceptable. Another example is that the sales of cloth are not moving, and the stock is getting thicker every day, but there was a sudden increase in price the other day, which is clearly a speculative action of short squeeze. Now that the war between the Soviet Union and Germany has begun, all German goods on the market are rare goods that can be stocked up. Finished medicines have risen by 30 to 40 percent, and they are still being held back from being sold. In addition, merchants and hoarders of rice, flour, and wheat almost all hope that Japan will advance to the south, but they do not think about what would happen to them if Japan really advanced to the south. How much could they hoard of rice, flour, and wheat, and must they be able to control huge profits? Even if they have huge profits in hand, their fate is shared with the public. Can they guarantee that there will be no future troubles? Only by not seeking excessive profits, not expecting undue blessings, sharing safety and danger with the public, and sharing happiness and suffering can we maintain prosperity. This is a way that hoarders cannot understand, and there is nothing we can do about it.

The only compensation that can be obtained to maintain general life is this, but in fact there are many difficulties. From this, we know that to solve the current problem of life, there is no other way than to endure pain and wait for the overall situation to be resolved.

Reuters, Berlin, 23rd. Last night, several Soviet planes were discovered in East Prussia, dropping many bombs in several places, causing losses to property and lives.

Reuters, Berlin, 23rd. A German radio station claimed last night that when the Red Army bombers launched their initial attack on East Prussia yesterday, 18 were shot down by German fighter planes.

Reuters, Berlin, 23rd. Reports from the Eastern Front received this morning unanimously declared that the first engagement had provided factual proof of the difference in strength between the German Air Force and the Soviet Air Force. German bomber fleets have flown over the enemy's front lines to attack rear transportation. The enemy's attempts to resist interception have completely failed. In addition, German forces have bombed enemy armored vehicles and the Red Army advancing towards the German border, scattering or annihilating them. The enemy's armored battalion ammunition depots and transport trains have been attacked and mostly destroyed. German planes have also launched large-scale attacks on several Soviet airfields, destroying many enemy planes parked on the field. The airfield suffered heavy losses.

### Chairman Chiang's Instructions

Chongqing - Continuing from yesterday, it also cannot maintain its independent existence. (3) Is:

### Equalization of Land Ownership

Promoting land policy requires the thorough implementation of land policy before the Three Principles of the People can be truly realized. The Premier had special lectures on these three revolutionary tasks, so I will not elaborate today. The first is a matter of principle: after the finances of each province are centrally managed, organized, and distributed by the central government, they will be unified by the National Treasury; the proposal to formulate methods for receiving and organizing in accordance with the Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee's resolutions to improve the financial revenue and expenditure system; the proposal to formulate reception steps, management institutions, and various organizational revenue and expenditure methods in accordance with the Fifth Central Committee's Eighth Plenary Session's decision to temporarily transfer land tax to central management and organization. Next, the discussion centered on Minister Kong's proposal to formulate implementation methods in accordance with the Executive Yuan's decision on land tax combined with in-kind payments. This proposal was one of the central agenda items of this meeting, and it was highly valued by all parties. Speakers included Huang Yanpei, Pan Xulun, Chen Changheng, and many others. Other members expressed many opinions, and the debate was very lively. It was almost 7:00 PM and the discussion was not yet completed. The discussion will continue on the 22nd so that serious research can be conducted. (21st Dispatch) Unifying the currency, I have already said before that since the implementation of legal tender in the 24th year, we have generally achieved our mission. The remaining two items, concerning the control of food and the land policy of equalizing land ownership, are not only peacetime but also current wartime financial and economic problems, and we should strive to complete them. If we still cannot implement them at this time, then there will be no time to implement them. Moreover, everyone should know that if the land policy cannot be implemented and food management cannot be implemented, then not only will the national economy have no foundation, but the entire national livelihood will also be in chaos and in a desperate situation. Therefore, no matter how many difficulties and sufferings we have to endure now, everyone must regard these two revolutionary tasks as fundamental matters related to the life and death of the nation, the race, and society and individuals, and promote, support, and achieve the goal of "benefit for both people and the country" with the spirit of unifying the currency in the 24th year of the Republic of China. Only in this way can our country be built up, and only then will the leaders of all sectors of our country be worthy of being the backbone of the anti-Japanese construction era, and only then will our men and women compatriots not lose their status as upright citizens of a modern country in the present era. However, my country's

### Political Economy

Will always stagnate in the position of a colony. Not only will we ourselves always be subject to external control and oppression, but our children and grandchildren will also have no chance to stand out. Therefore, after this national financial conference, not only must the issues of taxation and the financial revenue and expenditure system be thoroughly implemented, but especially the land policy and food management must be thoroughly implemented, which is the touchstone for our national people to build a truly independent and free modern country. I hope that our comrades in the political, military, and other fields, as well as leaders from all sectors of the country, will fully understand this truth, work together with one heart and one mind, and strive to complete the mission of this conference.

### Prime Minister Churchill Announces Britain's Decision to Aid Russia in Resisting Germany - Not Forgetting the Lessons of the Past - Doubling Efforts for a United Struggle

Reuters, London, 23rd - British Prime Minister Churchill, in a broadcast speech on the night of Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, announced the British government's decision to provide the Soviet Union with all possible assistance to resist Germany. The original text is as follows: I speak tonight because we are now facing one of the critical junctures of the war. There have been three such critical junctures before. First, the failure of France under the hammer blows of the German army and our unique position to save the situation. Second, the repulse of the German planes that attacked England during the day by our air force before we were fully prepared, allowing England to avoid invasion. Third, the establishment of the Lend-Lease Act by the US President and Congress, with this New World providing over 200 million pounds to help us defend freedom. Now the fourth critical juncture has come before us. At 4:00 AM this morning, Hitler attacked Russia. Hitler used meticulous means to carry out his

### Betrayal of Covenant

Usual ceremony. Russia and Germany had solemnly signed a non-aggression treaty, which had never expired. Germany had never accused Russia of not fulfilling its promises. Unexpectedly, it feigned trust, secretly amassed troops along the line from the White Sea to the Black Sea, and occupied key points on land and sea. Once the arrangements were completed, without declaring war and disregarding the amity, German planes suddenly bombed Russian towns and cities from the air, and German troops suddenly attacked the Russian border. The German ambassador to Russia the night before still boasted that German-Russian friendship was equal to that of the Allies, but an hour after Germany sent troops, he visited the Russian Foreign Minister and told him that a state of war existed between Russia and Germany. Hitler's act of tearing up signed contracts and destroying international credit has been seen repeatedly in Norway, Denmark, Holland, and Belgium. Hitler's accomplice Mussolini did the same in Greece. Now Hitler has applied it to Russia, on a scale even larger than before. However, all of this was within our expectations. In fact, I had clearly and explicitly told Stalin about the future crisis. I warned him, as I warned others. I can only hope that this warning was not ignored. As far as I know now,

### The Russian People

Are now defending their land, and their leaders have called on the people to actively resist. Hitler is a bloodthirsty, greedy monster. The whole of Europe and Africa has been ravaged by his iron hooves, or forced to submit to him. But Hitler is still not satisfied, and must carry out his work of slaughter and destruction against the vast populations of Russia and Asia. We and the other people of the civilized world, in our usual ignorance and confusion, cannot remain unmoved by the terrible war machine that the Nazi giants have created from nothing. Unless the machine rusts and turns to powder, it will continue to turn and grind down the lives of billions of people, and trample on their homes. Now this unblinking monster must seek new battlefields, use his mechanized army to engage in the destructive work of murder and looting, must seize the daily bread of Russian farmers, workers, and soldiers, must carry away their agricultural products, loot their oil, and cause an unprecedented famine in human history in Russia. Hitler has not yet won. Even if he wins, he will not be satisfied with adding destruction and demise to the Russian people. He must use this as a stepping stone to carry out his destruction of the 450 million people of China and the 350 million people of India, causing them to fall into the human

### Abyss of Degeneration

The swastika (translator's note: the "swastika" originally symbolized compassion in Buddhism, while the German emblem is the reverse of the "swastika". Churchill's statement refers to its "anti-compassion"). Tonight I say that it is no exaggeration to say that the lives and happiness of hundreds of millions of other people are now threatened by Nazi barbarism. This is enough to make us hold our breath, but at present I will show other events that are closely related to the lives of Britain and America, and see that the Nazi system is no different from the worst aspects of communism. The Nazi system has no so-called theory or principle, only desire and racial rule. Its cruelty and efficiency of aggression are unmatched by human ferocity. In the past twenty-five years, I have always opposed communism, as much as others. I will not retract what I have said, but at this moment, all kinds of evils, follies, and tragedies of the past have vanished before the sights now developing. I now see Russian soldiers standing at the national gate, defending their fields, which their ancestors have cultivated for generations. I now see them defending their homes, where their elderly mothers and loving wives pray for their loved ones, seeking food and protecting the safety of those who return home. I see

### Nazi War

Almost now just inflicting suffering on Russia. I see German bombers and fighters now turning their direction and hoping to find safer and easier victims. After this glimpse, I again see a few people plotting to implement the terror inflicted on mankind. At this point, my mind recalls the years when the Russian army and I jointly resisted the ugly enemy, using their courage to help us win. Unfortunately, there were changes in the middle of the day when the task was not fully accomplished. I have personally experienced all of this. You can understand my feelings when I recall the past at this time. But I must now announce the decision of the British government. I feel that this is a decision that the Great Dominions will approve. I must declare it immediately, without delaying for a day. I must issue a declaration, but can you doubt what our policy is? We have only one purpose and one unchangeable interest, that is, we are determined to destroy Hitler and all Nazi systems. We hold this decision and nothing can change it. We will not negotiate with Hitler or his party. We will fight Germany on the sea, land, and air until, with God's help, we cleanse the shadows on the earth and

### Liberate Mankind

From its fetters. Anyone or any country that fights against the Nazis will receive our assistance. Anyone or any country that goes hand in hand with Hitler is our enemy. This applies not only to organized countries, but also to the representatives of the Quisling scum. Quisling is willing to be a tool of the Nazis, and is an enemy of his own people and his own country. The Quisling generation is just like the Nazi leaders, and if they are resolved by their own people, it will save trouble. They have not yet been resolved by their own people, but we will resolve them on the day of victory according to the rulings of the Allied courts. The above is our policy and our declaration. Therefore, we will provide Russia and the Russian people with any possible assistance. We will ask all friends and comrades in the world to follow this path and faithfully carry it out to the end. We have provided the Soviet government with any technical or economic assistance that is within our power and can help Russia. We will, on a larger scale, day and night

### Bomb Germany

Dropping increasing numbers of bombs month by month, so that the German people can understand the suffering they are inflicting on mankind every month. There is something to tell you now. The British army shot down 21 German planes in the French interior yesterday, but this is only the beginning. The large expansion of our air force is proceeding rapidly. In another six months, the various military equipment assistance we have received from the United States, especially in heavy bombers, will show its strength. This is not a class war. This is a war in which the British Empire and the Dominions are fully committed, regardless of race, belief, or party. I cannot speak for the actions of the United States, but I can say that if Hitler believes that the attack on the Soviet Union will make the great democratic countries slightly divide their goals or slightly relax their efforts to eradicate Hitler's evil forces, then he is greatly mistaken. Not only will we not relax our efforts, but we will also encourage efforts to rescue mankind, and our determination and resources will increase and not weaken. If the countries and governments that have been defeated by the enemy one by one had united earlier, it would not have been difficult to save themselves and the world from disaster.

### To Avoid Great Calamity

But they did not come up with this plan, which is extremely foolish. It is not the time to correct it now. However, I said that Hitler is insatiable and his desires are endless. Therefore, when launching the attack on Russia, I thought that Hitler had deeper motives. Hitler wanted to destroy Russia's power because he hoped that after this move was successful, he could move his main land and air forces in the East to attack the British Isles. Hitler knew that he must defeat Britain, otherwise he would suffer the consequences. Therefore, Hitler's invasion of Russia was only a prelude to his attack on Britain. Hitler hoped that the invasion of Russia could be completed before winter, and then, before the US Navy and Air Force could intervene, he would conquer Britain with all his strength. Hitler plans to replay his previously effective tactic of defeating each one on a larger scale, and then proceed to the final scene, which is to make the Western Hemisphere obey his wishes and abide by his system. If not, all his efforts will be in vain. Therefore, the danger of Russia is the danger of us, and it is also the danger of the United States, and the war that Russia is fighting for is also the war that

### Free People

Are fighting for all over the world. Let us not forget the lessons given by past experiences. Let us all redouble our efforts while our lives and strength are still there, and make a united struggle, it is said.

### Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Will Conduct Close Economic Cooperation - Soviet Allies Are Under Consideration - Britain Assures the Soviet Union to Intensify Operations

Reuters, Washington, 23rd - Washington received the news of Germany's attack on the Soviet Union with considerable surprise, because people in Washington generally believed that Stalin would "concede until he retreated to Vladivostok" before fighting. Today, all sectors regard the surprising turn of events in the war as the only topic of discussion, believing that Hitler's demands must have been extremely harsh, so that the Stalin, who likes compromise, could not submit to his demands and still be supported by the people and control the power. It was previously rumored here that the German army strongly advocated action against the Soviet Union, but this ambition was curbed by Hitler. Now that the German army has actually attacked the Soviet Union, it is believed that Hitler's opposition was finally overcome by the argument that the German side could only resist the British blockade by obtaining Soviet raw materials and food. It is believed that the German army's attack on the Soviet Union and the German side's confirmation that they have delayed the use of it are currently quite important matters. People are now enthusiastically discussing the issue of whether the Allied countries should aid the Soviet Union. Realists believe that anything that can help destroy Hitler is welcome. The diplomatic community expects that as a result of the invasion of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will cooperate closely in the economic field. Washington has been experiencing frequent diplomatic activities due to the invasion of the Soviet Union. The US government has not issued any formal statements, but the State Department said that Germany's attack on the Soviet Union proves that Hitler has the ambition to control the whole world, and that signing non-aggression treaties with Germany only gives Germany the opportunity to attack another signatory country at will. The US response clearly condemned Germany as an aggressor, and has raised the issue of US aid. However, officials are currently continuing to study the development of the situation, and are unwilling to indicate what actions the United States will take. It is expected that President Roosevelt will soon announce recognition of the state of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, but there will be no change in the current European war zone where US ships are prohibited from sailing. The war zone determined by the US President already includes the Arctic ports of the Soviet Union and other unaffected areas. The main issue for US rulers is Japan's attitude. US officials are currently carefully watching this.

United Press, Stockholm, 13th - Yesterday afternoon at 3:15 PM, the radio broadcast from Moscow heard here said that the British, American, and Soviet alliance is currently under consideration.

### Separate Meetings of Ambassadors from the Three Countries

It is reported that Winant met with British Prime Minister Churchill for a long time on Sunday. Unconfirmed reports also said that Winant and Churchill also discussed with Washington officials by telephone.

Independent and free Finland calls on its people to remain calm."

Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 13th - The Finnish government convened a meeting yesterday morning. It is expected that a declaration will be issued. The situation in Helsinki is still calm. We are continuing to engage in air defense preparations.

Havas, Stockholm, 22nd - How many German troops have arrived in Finland is kept secret by the authorities, but it is known that the commander of the German vanguard in Finland is General Falkenhorst, commander of the German troops in Norway, and is assisted by General Dietl (an Austrian), a hero of the Battle of Narvik. The military objective of this German army is to capture the Murmansk Railway, which runs from the Arctic Ocean directly to Leningrad. It is located in the far north of the world and is the only route for British-Soviet traffic. As for the Finnish troops, they are concentrated in the southeast and are still commanded by General Mannerheim. However, the military objective is still unknown. According to reliable sources here, the task of the army is only to protect the Karelian Isthmus to prevent the Soviet troops from raiding.

Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 23rd - Last night, Helsinki issued an initial air raid alert, which was lifted only 20 minutes later. Helsinki's anti-aircraft fire was fierce, repelling Soviet aircraft. Several places in southern Finland also issued alerts late at night.

Romania is exceptionally calm, and mobilization is proceeding smoothly.

### British Warship Intercepts German Supply Ship in the Atlantic; Admiralty Officially Announces Bombing of Alexandria Again

Reuters, London, 23rd: This morning, the Admiralty announced that the German ship Babitonga (4,422 tons), used as a supply ship, has been intercepted by a British patrol.

### Japanese Cabinet to Hold Meeting Today to Discuss Policies Towards Germany and the Soviet Union; General Expectations are that Japan Will Maintain a Wait-and-See Attitude and Not Fulfill Treaty Obligations

Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd: An emergency joint meeting of the Japanese government and high command to discuss the German-Soviet war and Japan's policy has been postponed until this afternoon. However, according to authoritative sources, the Japanese cabinet will hold a regular meeting tomorrow and announce Japan's policy towards the Soviet-German war. Informed sources claim that the content of this announcement will not be surprising. However, the official nature of the announcement has not been revealed this afternoon. Observers believe that the postponement of the joint statement by Prime Minister Konoe and Wang Jingwei, chairman of the Nanjing regime, regarding Japan's policy towards China is significant. It is believed that the postponement of this statement is due to the developments between the Soviet Union and Germany. Germans here believe that the Soviet Union will collapse before American aid can be realized and arrive via Vladivostok. However, if the Soviet Union can hold out and American aid begins to enter from Vladivostok, Japan will be required to act in accordance with the Tripartite Pact. The emergency joint meeting of the cabinet and high command was postponed for a second time this afternoon. Senior officials discussed the new situation of Germany attacking the Soviet Union until midnight last night and scheduled a joint meeting for this morning, which was then changed to 3 p.m. and later postponed again. At the same time, Prime Minister Konoe visited the Emperor, presumably to inform the Emperor of Japan's position on the Soviet-German war.

Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd: Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe convened an emergency liaison meeting late last night with the cabinet and the commanders of the army and navy. At the same time, Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka's audience with the Emperor was also related to this meeting. Informed sources indicate that the Japanese authorities were already aware of the possibility of war between Germany and the Soviet Union and had prepared all the necessary countermeasures. Japan's current response to this matter only confirms that Japan will maintain a cautious wait-and-see attitude. Officials stated that Matsuoka, in his audience with the Emperor, reported on the outbreak of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, and also discussed other major international events. The Japanese news agency quoted a diplomatic commentator as saying that the European war will soon spread into a global war, and the international situation is extremely complex. Furthermore, the Japanese side predicted that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will unite. However, commentators were greatly surprised by the sudden outbreak of war, as it was generally believed that all points of disagreement between Germany and the Soviet Union could eventually be eliminated. As for the reasons for Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, commentators have speculated widely: one, that the Soviet Union threatened to stop supplying Germany with goods; two, that the Soviet Union obstructed Germany's conquest of the Balkans, such as by concluding non-aggression treaties with Yugoslavia; three, that Germany feared the Soviet Union could unite with Britain at any time. However, commentators did not say a word about the repercussions for Japan of the German-Soviet war. Outside the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun newspaper office, crowds gathered to read the news bulletins. An official announcement stated that German Ambassador General Ott met with Foreign Minister Matsuoka for an hour last night. While Prime Minister Konoe was meeting with senior cabinet officials, Foreign Minister Matsuoka met with the heads of the European bureaus of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. All morning newspapers carried the news of the war in large headlines, but did not comment on Japan's future policy. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the purpose of this cabinet meeting was to clarify Japan's firm attitude, as the future development of the international situation will have a serious impact on Japan both domestically and internationally. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the Japanese government is currently adopting a "very cautious attitude."

### Japan Extremely Surprised by Germany's Attack on the Soviet Union

Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd: An editorial in this morning's Asahi Shimbun stated that the Soviet-German war is even more shocking to the world than the Soviet-German non-aggression pact concluded two years ago. Judging from the Hitler's declaration received here, the reason for Germany's attack is unclear. In any case, Japan is now facing a more serious situation, which, regardless of treaty considerations, has left no room for doubt. The Asahi Shimbun also carried a telephone report from its Berlin correspondent stating that the German people were dumbfounded upon learning of the declaration of war against the Soviet Union, as they all believed what German newspapers had said about Germany and the Soviet Union soon achieving greater friendship and cooperation.

### Soviet Union Asks Japan to Observe Neutrality

Associated Press, Tokyo, 24th: "The Japan Times and Mail," which is regarded as a semi-official organ of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, declared today, "Japan, based on its treaties with Germany and the Soviet Union, maintains friendship with both sides, which is to maintain neutrality before a national policy is decided." At the same time, a German source, traditionally considered reliable, said that Germany has no intention of asking Japan to fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite Alliance in the Soviet-German war. The reliable source also believes that the Soviet Union is preparing to send a note to Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, asking Japan to strictly observe neutrality in accordance with the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact.

### British Ambassador Visits Japanese Vice Minister

Associated Press, Tokyo, Day: British Ambassador Craigie called on Japanese Vice Minister Ohashi this morning to exchange information on the Soviet-German war. They spoke for 45 minutes, mostly about the European situation after the outbreak of the Soviet-German war.

### Araki Advised to Observe Events Quietly

Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd: Lieutenant Colonel Akita, former army attache at the Japanese Embassy in Germany, recently spoke with a reporter from the Hochi Shimbun, saying that Germany could defeat the Soviet Union before autumn. Akita said that, judging by the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, we can see that no international treaty is reliable, and the only thing that is reliable is our own country. The "Current Affairs Commentary" column of the Asahi Shimbun raised the question of the world situation, "What should we do on this earth?", and answered it itself, "The Japanese nation, both public and private, should strengthen its determination." The resignation of the Hiranuma cabinet was due to the complexity and dubiousness of the international situation, but now there is nothing to be surprised about, as every country is pursuing its own diplomacy, and the result is nothing more than advancing with its own strength. General Araki Sadao, who observed the German-Russian war in the previous European war, warned the Japanese people not to hesitate unnecessarily about the current chaotic international situation. Araki advised the Japanese to continue to unify domestic public opinion and observe the situation calmly. Araki told the Nichi Nichi Shimbun that the Germans were attempting to conquer the Soviet Union in a few weeks with a blitzkrieg, while the Soviet Union was trying to prolong the war. He also said that if the Red Army collapsed in the early stages of the war, it was feared that the Soviet Union would lose its fighting spirit and be annihilated.

### Chongqing Newspaper Expresses Complete Sympathy for the Soviet Union Being Attacked

Associated Press, Chongqing, 23rd: The Central Daily News recently stated that China fully sympathizes with the Soviet Union. The newspaper also predicts that the Soviet Union may win. Most Chinese believe that the Soviet-German war will prevent Soviet military aid to China, but at the same time, they feel that the rapid increase in American aid may compensate for this loss and more. The Ta Kung Pao said that the Soviet Union, which is now at war with Germany, should recognize Japan as the enemy on the eastern front. The Central Daily News wrote, "The world has made it clear that Germany is an aggressor. This Soviet-German war is the fault of Germany and is an undeniable fact. We fully sympathize with and believe that the Soviet Union will win. Germany's attempt to conquer a strong country like the Soviet Union with a blitzkrieg is militarily impossible. We should also ask Moscow to pay attention and prepare to deal with Japan's attack on the eastern front, because if Germany can tear up the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, then why can't Japan tear up the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact?" The Ta Kung Pao also believes that Japan will attack the eastern borders of the Soviet Union to help Germany.

Havas, Chongqing, 22nd: News of Hitler's declaration of war on the Soviet Union was only confirmed here in the afternoon. Officials and private individuals paid unusual attention to this. Following reports of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union, all parties were even more interested. However, the government has not prepared to make any formal statement. Political figures generally believe that China's wartime stance is very clear and will not change due to changes in the international situation, and that the Soviet-German war will not have any disadvantages for China, let alone in terms of domestic affairs. As for the Anglo-Soviet agreement, if it is true, it would be beneficial and harmless. The most noteworthy question at the moment is what Japan will do.

### Soviet Presidium Announces Martial Law in Various Regions and Establishes Special Military Tribunals; Mobilization is Simultaneously Carried Out in All Military Districts

TASS, Moscow, 22nd: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union declared that martial law has been implemented in several regions. The areas under martial law include the Arkhangelsk Oblast, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Vologda Oblast, the Voronezh Oblast, the Ivanovo Oblast, the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, the Kalinin Oblast, the Krasnodar Krai, the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, the Kursk Oblast, the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Leningrad Oblast, the Mordovian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Murmansk Oblast, the Moscow Oblast, the Oryol Oblast, the Rostov Oblast, the Ryazan Oblast, the Saransk Oblast, the Tula Oblast, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Yaroslavl. At the same time, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union promulgated decrees on martial law and military tribunals in all areas under martial law.

TASS, Moscow, 22nd: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union announced that the Leningrad Military District, the Baltic Special Military District, the Western Special Military District, the Kiev Special Military District, Odessa, Kharkov, Oryol, Moscow, Arkhangelsk, Ural, Siberia, Volga, North Caucasus, and Transcaucasus Military Districts have been mobilized. All trained personnel from 1905 to 1918 are subject to mobilization.

Reuters, London, 23rd: Moscow Radio broadcasted last night the Supreme Soviet's decree outlining the details of the declaration of martial law in various regions of the Soviet Union. The military has the power over national defense and public security, may recruit people for labor and defense tasks to protect transportation, power plants, and other important targets, as well as fire fighting tasks, and may designate military barracks, implement curfews, restrict traffic, and prohibit people from entering and leaving the jurisdiction. All public organizations must cooperate with the military authorities. Special military tribunals have been established to hear cases related to public security and national defense. Another order stipulates the work and procedures of these military tribunals. Last night, Moscow Radio's last broadcast did not include a communique on military operations. When the station reported foreign news in the evening, its tone had changed significantly, and it broadcast more British news than usual, including detailed reports on President Roosevelt's statement on the sinking of the Robin Moor.

### Soviet Citizens Eagerly Volunteer

TASS, Moscow, 23rd: With the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, people everywhere have convened meetings and sent telegrams to Stalin and Molotov, requesting to join the Red Army and be sent to the front lines to fight. In the telegrams, the people assured Stalin and the government that they are determined to fight to the last drop of blood in a courageous spirit, eliminate the hateful enemy, and defend the socialist motherland.

TASS, Moscow, 23rd: Immediately after Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov made his declaration, mass meetings were held throughout the Soviet Union. The perfidious aggression of the German fascist rulers against the Soviet Union has aroused the anger of the people of the whole country, and they have unanimously expressed their unyielding determination not to completely defeat the arrogant enemy. The meeting at the Moscow Bearing Machinery Factory stated, "We are confident that our Red Army, Air Force, and Navy will respond to this treacherous attack with a fierce blow, so as to eliminate the enemies of our socialist motherland. The enemy must be defeated. We support the heroic resistance of our beloved Red Army and Navy, and we will defend our sacred motherland to the death and fight the fascist bandits with all our might." Workers and employees of the Moscow "Dynamo" factory listened to Molotov's radio report yesterday. At the meeting, a female worker, Comrade Knorre, said, "We unanimously support the actions of the Soviet government. We have strong confidence in our own strength and will definitely inflict a heavy blow on the enemy."

### Reactions in Various Countries to the German-Soviet War; Turkey Decides to Maintain Neutrality

Havas, Istanbul, 22nd: After the news of the German-Soviet war spread to this country, the Turkish people were not shocked in any way. Foreign Minister Saracoglu still went to the countryside for vacation as originally planned, which is proof of this. Diplomatic circles said that seeing as the Foreign Minister has not postponed his leave, it shows that Turkey has decided to continue to maintain neutrality and stay out of the matter. This is because Turkey has a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union on one hand and has just signed a neutrality and friendship treaty with Germany on the other. Although the heads of the Turkish government were quite disturbed by Hitler's statement in his declaration of war against the Soviet Union regarding the Soviet Union's request for the Dardanelles Strait, responsible parties said that as early as October of last year, when Foreign Minister Saracoglu was visiting Moscow, the Soviet Union had made certain requests regarding the Strait, to which Turkey had made a clear reply at the time, so the Soviet authorities should have no doubts about Turkey's attitude.

Reuters, Berlin, 23rd: An Istanbul dispatch states that the Turkish Parliament has decided to extend the state of emergency previously declared in Istanbul and Turkish territory in Europe for another six months.

### Sweden Orders Soldiers Back to Duty

Reuters, Swedish Capital, 23rd: The Swedish Prime Minister returned to the capital from his country villa yesterday, convened a cabinet meeting, and all Swedish ships on the high seas have received radio orders to sail into Swedish seaports, and soldiers on leave have been ordered to return to duty immediately.

Reuters, Swedish Capital, 23rd:

The Swedish cabinet held an emergency meeting this morning to consider Germany's demand that Sweden clarify its actual position. Berlin refers to Sweden as a concentration point for communist activities and plots detrimental to Germany.

### Bulgarian Policy

Havas, Bulgarian Capital, 22nd: News of the German-Soviet war has made a deep impression in Bulgaria, but relevant parties said that since this war does not involve Bulgarian interests, the government's current neutral policy should be maintained unchanged.

### Rumors of Hungary Joining

Reuters, London, 23rd:

According to rumors received here today, Hungary may soon join the German side in the attack on the Soviet Union.

### One Soviet Ship Sunk by Germany

Reuters, Berlin, 23rd: It has just been learned from reliable sources that yesterday a Soviet ship (4,000 tons) was sunk by a German speedboat with a torpedo in Soviet territorial waters, and another Soviet fishing boat was destroyed.

### Damascus Not Damaged

Reuters, London, 23rd: Information received here today states that Damascus, the capital of Syria, which is currently occupied by the Free French forces, has not been damaged. Vichy troops retreated, so there was no fighting in the old city. Yesterday, British aircraft attacked motor transport vehicles on the Damascus-Beirut highway several times, destroying 37 vehicles.

### Defense Exercises Held in Burma

Reuters, Rangoon, 23rd: A public announcement here states that Burma will hold defense exercises for four days next month to test its state of readiness for war.

### Telegram from the German Foreign Ministry to the Soviet Union

Berlin, December 12th (Haitong News Agency) - The German Foreign Ministry today sent a telegram to the Soviet Russian government, stating that Moscow has destroyed the basis of German-Soviet amity, violated solemn declarations, and adopted a hostile attitude towards Germany. The telegram explains how Germany broke through political conflicts between the two countries, sought to maintain a balance of interests, and attempted to eliminate the possibility of war with this view, thereby achieving understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union, safeguarding the rights essential to the survival of the two peoples, and preventing the spread of international Jewry and communism. However, some recent actions of the Russian government are far from this principle. Since concluding the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, Germany has changed its attitude towards the Soviet Union. However, Soviet Russia has continued with its old ways. Russians in Germany have not only engaged in sabotage but also attempted to incite division. These Russians, under the orders of the Moscow political police and the command of Commissioner Krylov, have organized sabotage in Germany and the occupied areas, secretly set up laboratories, privately manufactured bombs, and disrupted public order. German ships have been bombed. Anti-German leaflets have been distributed and communism openly promoted in countries such as Weimar, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Slovakia. Furthermore, anti-German propaganda has been broadcast from a radio station in Finland, and pressure has been exerted on Bulgaria to dissuade it from joining the Axis powers. On January 23, 1941, there was even an uprising by the Iron Guard in Romania. In November 1940, people were sent to Yugoslavia to promise military assistance, provided that the southern country kept it secret from Germany. The coup in Yugoslavia on March 27 of this year was the culmination of Soviet Russian conspiracies. The leader of the coup, Simic, is still in Moscow today, secretly discussing anti-German measures with the Soviet Russian authorities. Based on the above facts, Soviet Russia completely regards the German-Soviet pact of 1939 as a tool for its own use. This is consistent with Lenin's consistent policy: "If a certain country can help Soviet Russia to seek its interests, it can conclude a pact with it."

In terms of diplomacy and military affairs, Soviet Russia's sole objective is to advance its military strength, develop westward from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, and communize Europe. Therefore, after the war against Finland, it attacked the Baltic countries, disregarding Moscow's guarantees. Lithuania was originally within Germany's sphere of interest. Germany made concessions to the Soviet Union for the sake of peace, but the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum on June 15, completely occupying Lithuania without notifying Germany. After arduous negotiations, Germany also expressed its willingness to reconcile, with no other purpose than to hope for peace.

Regarding the Bessarabian territorial issue, although Soviet Russia's attitude violated the 1939 pact, Germany still supported Soviet Russia's position, causing Romania to accept the facts created by Soviet Russia, because Germany still hoped to maintain peace with Soviet Russia as much as possible.

However, Soviet Russia then attempted to make demands in the Balkans, the scope of which was not specified. The German government received intelligence that Soviet Russia was conducting negotiations with the British ambassador to Soviet Russia, Cripps, which were progressing very smoothly. Subsequently, it received a telegram that Soviet Russia had conspicuously increased its troops on the border. According to a report from the military attaché in Yugoslavia, "According to Soviet Russian sources, the Russian air force, tank corps, and artillery equipment are now being manufactured in large quantities, and according to the standards of this European war, they can be completed by August of this year. At that time, Soviet Russian policy will inevitably undergo major changes."

When Molotov was invited for questioning, Germany learned that Soviet Russia sincerely intended to cooperate with the countries of the Tripartite Pact and secretly seek friendly cooperation with Germany, but it had to obtain the required price. This price included Soviet Russia's expansion in Northern and Southeastern Europe. Molotov demanded that Germany guarantee Bulgaria's establishment of a Baltic mutual assistance pact and allow Soviet Russia to establish military bases in Bulgaria. Secondly, he demanded that Germany guarantee the Russian-Turkish pact, so that Turkey would lease the Bosphorus and Dardanelles to Soviet Russia for a long period. Thirdly, Molotov demanded that Germany abandon Finland, so that Soviet Russia could occupy the entire territory of Finland. Although Germany expressed its refusal to such demands, it attempted to reach an understanding with it, but ultimately failed.

As a result, Soviet Russia intensified its anti-German policy, maintained frequent contact with Britain, protested against the German army's presence in Bulgaria, and even publicly issued anti-German declarations, criticizing the German army's entry into Bulgaria. On April 5 of this year, Soviet Russia also signed a pact with the rebel government of Yugoslavia, the purpose of which was obviously to unite with Britain to help Yugoslavia attack Germany and incite Turkey to oppose Germany. It concentrated troops on the Romanian border, threatening Romania to break away from its relationship with Germany. It also massively concentrated troops from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, taking advantage of Germany's involvement in Western Europe, arranging military forces, and plotting wrongdoing. The German military authorities repeatedly pointed this out to the Foreign Ministry, urging attention, believing that this concentration of troops had no other explanation except for the intent to invade. Since April of this year, incidents of Russian troops violating the border have been heard from time to time. According to recent news, there are already 150 divisions of Soviet troops on the border, and their aggressive ambitions cannot be concealed. Coupled with the Soviet army's patrols and reconnaissance activities, and the small conflicts between the German and Soviet armies on the border, the military situation is extremely serious. Lord Beaverbrook, a British politician who has always opposed Soviet Russia, has also expressed his views, calling on Britain to support Soviet Russia's war with all its strength, and seeking the same attitude from the United States. At the same time, British Ambassador to Soviet Russia Cripps is working hard to achieve close political and military cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union. Therefore, how Soviet Russia is preparing and what its intentions are are obvious to everyone.

### After the Soviet-German War, the People of Shanghai are Extremely Excited, Believing that the Situation in the Far East is Becoming More Stable and the Commercial Risks of Britain and America have Greatly Decreased

The news that Germany suddenly declared war on the Soviet Union has caused great attention from people of all countries in this city. The news that German-Soviet relations were deteriorating had been circulating for a long time, but it was not expected that Germany would declare war so quickly. Therefore, people from all countries in this city expressed shock over the past two days, and the financial market fluctuated. However, people of all democratic countries are excited about this event, because British Prime Minister Churchill has clearly announced that Britain is determined to help the Soviet Union, and there is a real hope that the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be realized. If Hitler does not quickly defeat the Soviet Union, he will follow the same path as the last European war. As far as the Far East is concerned, it is generally expected that Japan will not fulfill its alliance obligations and create more enemies. Therefore, the situation in the Far East seems to have changed little, and the impact on this city is limited. The news from various sources yesterday is recorded below:

Chinese and Foreign People are in High Spirits

People from democratic countries in this city expressed surprise after hearing the news of the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, but their mood was extremely excited. They believed that the democratic countries had gained a strong general to extinguish the Nazi menace. Yesterday, in front of the Zilin West Newspaper Office on the Bund and the British Information Office, there were many foreign people standing and watching the British-published afternoon newspaper, because the newspaper contained the news that British Prime Minister Churchill had decided to help the Soviet Union. The afternoon newspaper can be obtained by all residents of this city from the British Information Office every day, and it is usually distributed by 1:00 PM. However, when the newspaper was published at 11:00 AM yesterday, there were countless Chinese and foreign people in front of the Information Office, and all copies were taken away in an instant, which shows the enthusiasm. Foreign residents in the streets and alleys talked about the Soviet-German war whenever they met.

The Democratic Front Gains a New Turning Point

Chinese and foreign people in this city are discussing the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, believing that this war is a "turning point in the European war," and that its scale has opened a "new era in history." The result of this war is the "key to the survival of Hitler and his ideology." Although the Nazi leaders in this city expressed optimism, most Germans believed that the government's move was a mistake. People from the United States, Britain, and other countries in this city believe that the Soviet Union's strength has recently increased and that it will be able to defeat the German army and make the position of the democratic countries more solid. The shipping industry believes that the Siberian Railway will increase its workload due to the war, and Shanghai will not be able to obtain German goods. In terms of postal services, all mail to Germany, except for parcels that have already been stopped, is still normal. It is now waiting for a notification from the Tianjin Post Office as to whether or not to continue sending mail.

Shanghai Soviet Citizens Vow to Oppose Aggression

After learning the news of Germany's declaration of war on the Soviet Union, the reporter yesterday specially visited Mr. Rogov, the director of the Soviet Tass Agency in this city, to ask about the details of the war. He said that apart from the official announcement that the Soviet government had begun to resist aggression, there was no detailed news about the war. However, details will be announced in a few days. When asked about the news that Soviet citizens in this city had sent a telegram to Moscow to support the war of resistance policy, he said that the Soviet people would resolutely oppose any foreign aggression and would never tolerate harm to the security of their motherland. Yesterday, Soviet Russian newspapers in this city, such as "Homeland News," published large photos of Stalin and Churchill, as well as photos of the Red Army on the battlefield. Soviet citizens who purchased the newspapers were very enthusiastic.

Telegrams to the Government Supporting the War of Resistance

According to the Zilin West Newspaper, Soviet citizens in this city, after receiving the news of the start of the Soviet-German war yesterday (the 22nd), convened an emergency meeting at the "Soviet General Assembly" at 6:00 PM on the same day. They immediately decided to send a telegram to Kalinin, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Moscow, expressing their unanimous support. The telegram stated, "Chairman Kalinin of Moscow, Soviet citizens in Shanghai, after receiving the news that our country's borders have been invaded by fascist Germany, believe that this war is the last desperate adventure of Hitler and his gang. We firmly believe that they will be repelled by our victorious Red Army. Soviet citizens all over the world will forever be loyal to their country. We know that our people and our government do not need war. All war instigators will be defeated within their own borders. We pay tribute to Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the entire Soviet people. Soviet citizens in Shanghai (signed)."

The German Embassy and Consulate Work Through the Night

According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, after the news of the outbreak of the German-Soviet war came at 1:00 PM yesterday (the 22nd), the entire staff of the German Embassy and Consulate General at the corner of Beijing Road, even though it was a weekly holiday, still remained at the embassy to work. Until late at night, the lights were still bright. German citizens also contacted the local authorities to inquire about the truth, so the staff was extremely busy answering phone calls and appeared quite nervous. According to Mr. Code, the Minister of Intelligence of Germany, he received an official announcement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 1:00 PM yesterday that Berlin had resolutely declared war on the Soviet Union at 6:00 AM. Since the conclusion of the German-Soviet pact, the Soviet Union has always carried out anti-German work and concentrated a large army of 170 divisions on the border to prepare for war against Germany. Now the German side has obtained evidence, and Chancellor Hitler has issued a declaration explaining the process of this declaration of war. Germany has mobilized the largest army in German history to safeguard "world peace," and its intention is to fully promote "justice." Finland and Romania, along with other countries, have taken the same action as Germany.

Stocks Rise

The main reaction of Shanghai's business community to the news of the outbreak of the Soviet-German war was the sudden surge in the stock market yesterday morning (the 23rd). Buying was very active, but sellers were unwilling to let go. Asia Shipping stocks rose to 14.60 yuan, which was 12% higher than the closing price last week. Jardine Matheson instantly broke through the 100 yuan mark, rising to 108 yuan. Jardine Matheson rose to 39 yuan, a gain of three yuan. Near noon, the stock exchange became calmer, and it was difficult to obtain the high prices of the morning. The rise was limited to general stocks, and rubber was not noticed.

Legal Tender Remains Firm

The general opinion of people in the stock market is that the outbreak of the Soviet-German war has greatly improved Britain's chances of fighting and eased the tension in the Pacific region. Therefore, they believe that the political and military risks for British and American businesses in Shanghai have also greatly decreased. The exchange market opened weaker yesterday morning, and the US exchange rate once fell to 5.34375 yuan, which is 18.71 yuan of legal tender per US dollar. Then the legal tender strengthened, and by noon, the US exchange rate was 5.4375 yuan, which is 18.39 yuan of legal tender per US dollar, slightly higher than the closing price on Saturday.

German Goods Halt

The high-level critics in Shanghai pointed out that the outbreak of the Soviet-German war abruptly ended the transit trade of German goods across Siberia. No matter how the war develops, there will no longer be German goods transported to Shanghai via Siberia, and exports from the Far East to Germany will no longer be able to be transported by land. The business of many German firms here will be hit hard and will come to a standstill. The same is true for many Japanese and neutral firms that cooperate with German firms to engage in import and export trade with Germany.

Japanese Influence

The business community also said that the disappearance of the transit trade of German goods across Siberia will end all disputes between Japan and various democratic countries caused by the transit trade. Since Japan has no way to transport supplies to Germany by land, future purchases of supplies will be limited to what Japan needs. The reaction in the Shanghai commodity market is mixed. Yarn prices have risen, while the prices of ten important export products to the Guandong Leased Territory, Manchuria, and Vladivostok have fallen. It is heard that the price of free German marks in private transactions has greatly eased.

### Seasonal Diseases Gradually Become Prevalent, Epidemic Prevention is Tense

Shanghai is densely populated, and the authorities and all sectors are paying close attention to summer epidemic prevention. Since the beginning of this summer, seasonal diseases have gradually become prevalent. Various public and private epidemic hospitals have begun to admit patients one after another. In view of the crowding of seasonal disease patients every summer, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital and the Public Works Department Isolation Hospital have appropriately increased beds this year. The injection of epidemic prevention vaccines is still being carried out. It is reported that the number of citizens vaccinated this year has exceeded the records of previous years, as the Shanghai Medical Association has assisted the Health Bureau in leading doctors throughout the city to provide extensive services. The number of vaccine recipients has exceeded 10,000 so far (the association is located at 25 Chihama Road, telephone 34972). This is not only personal safety but also of great benefit to public health. The authorities express deep satisfaction with the cooperation of local people and medical organizations in promoting epidemic prevention. Since the incident, the population of this city has increased dramatically, and the maintenance of public health depends on the strength of the public. The following is a summary of the number of Chinese patients and deaths in the Public Concession in the week before midnight on June 21: 86 cases of tuberculosis, 77 deaths; 90 cases of typhoid fever, 68 deaths.

### The Cleaning Tide is Due to the Increase in the Price of Manure, and Ship Households Refuse to Purchase, Shanghai West has been on Strike for Many Days

The Public Concession Cleaning Department is contracted by Dali Company. Recently, due to the increase in the selling price and the beating of ship households by staff, it has aroused the opposition of all ship households, who have unanimously refused to purchase and transport manure. For the past two days, no ships have been transporting manure, which is being poured into the large ditches. At this time of year, if this stalemate continues, it will affect sanitation and can lead to epidemics. It is heard that the ship owners have already submitted a request to the Political Department of the Public Works Department to mediate. In addition, the Shanghai West Cleaning Department in Caojiadu has also caused a strike due to the selling price issue. The stalemate has lasted for six days, resulting in manure flowing everywhere and a foul odor.

### Grocery Stores Hoard and Control Price-Controlled Rice, The Authorities Will Implement Planned Management, The Rice Market is Ordered to Stop Afternoon Trading

Rumors of rice weevils have been created in recent days, causing rice prices to rise again and again. The cause is that some grocery stores applied to the Price-Controlled Rice Agency last Saturday to continue to order price-controlled foreign rice. The responsible authorities refused because the price-controlled foreign rice they had ordered in the past had not been completely resold to retail rice stores. Applying to order again was obviously suspected of hoarding. Generally nervous people thought that the Price-Controlled Rice Agency refused to continue the order, which must be because the authorities stopped the transportation and sale of price-controlled foreign rice. The news spread, and the general rice market speculators took the opportunity to act unscrupulously. The market was then disrupted, and rice prices were driven up.

Continued Purchases Only Allowed After Hoarded Goods are Sold

Yesterday, according to sources, at the meeting of the Public Works Department last Saturday, a decision was made to severely punish each grocery store that hoarded and did not resell price-controlled foreign rice and to implement a planned management system. It is reported that there are more than 210,000 bags of price-controlled rice, including the small-grain rice that arrived earlier. At present, only half of them have been sold, and the rest are in the hands of hoarders. The authorities must wait for these people to completely resell their hoarded goods before allowing them to continue to order.

The First Batch of Mindan Rice has Arrived

In addition to small-grain rice, the price-controlled foreign rice handled by the Public Works Department is continuing to ship special Mindan rice from Yangon. The first batch of 5,000 bags arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and has been unloaded. The quality of the rice is better than that of small-grain rice. Whether it will be sold immediately or after the small-grain rice is sold out will be decided by the Public Works Department. Also arriving at the same time were 4,950 bags of half-price small-grain rice. With the soaring rice prices in recent days, the small-grain rice sold at fixed prices by residents has been sold out by most retail rice stores. In addition, as the situation in Europe is tense, it is believed that it may affect Shanghai. Therefore, yesterday morning, more than 100 retail rice stores went to Lichiji Foreign Firm to purchase more than 10,000 bags in total. Lichiji Foreign Firm was overwhelmed and posted a notice yesterday afternoon to stop purchases in the afternoon, causing many people to miss out. If you want to purchase more, you can go there today.

No Market in the Rice Market in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the prices of all kinds of rice in the rice market rose again. In view of this, the Concession Authorities ordered the Grain Association to set trading hours to be in the morning and prohibit black market transactions in the afternoon. As a result, trading in the rice market was also suspended yesterday afternoon. At the same time, the Grain Association also issued a notice yesterday stating that afternoon trading will be completely suspended from the 25th of this month (i.e., tomorrow).

### New Wheat Sources are Not Smooth, Flour Mills Face Difficulties, and the Issue of Distribution is a Problem, The Mills Ask the Authorities to Dredge and Transport

Recently, at the time when new wheat is on the market, the selling price of foreign flour has risen to five yuan, which is the opposite of the situation in previous years, causing many rumors. Some say that international unrest will interrupt the source of foreign flour, or that this year's new wheat harvest is poor, and the sale of fixed-price flour will be discontinued soon. The existing foreign flour is being transported as much as possible by wholesalers. The arguments are messy and confusing.

Sufficient Inventory

However, according to reliable information from the flour industry yesterday, the rumors are not credible. The amount of foreign flour currently stored in this city is nearly 2 million bags, and there are still 500,000 to 600,000 bags in transit. For the needs of citizens, there will definitely not be a shortage this year. Orders can still be placed as usual from abroad, only transportation is subject to unexpected risks.

Control is Tightened

The new wheat harvest is also not as poor as rumored. However, the control of production areas this year is indeed tighter than last year. Not only is it difficult for Chinese merchants to transport grain, but foreign flour mills are also not as convenient as in previous years. Wheat merchants and flour mills only expect the new wheat to enter the market in the summer.

Difficulty in Supporting Fixed-Price Flour

The Fufeng Mill originally planned to start operating with the foreign wheat stored by the Fuxin Mill this month, but it will also be used up and shut down by the end of the month. Therefore, the continued sale of fixed-price flour has also become a problem. New wheat is difficult to expect, and it is too late to order foreign wheat again. Moreover, the fixed price of foreign wheat is more than 60 yuan, which is equivalent to a flour price of 33 to 34 yuan, which is very different from the fixed selling price.

Dredging and Transporting New Wheat

It is now heard that manufacturers intend to ask the Public Works Department to find ways to dredge and transport new wheat in order to continue to operate as usual and maintain the livelihood of workers. It is believed that the Concession Authorities, in view of the flour mills' sacrifice of profits and the stabilization of the flour market in recent years, will surely give their support.

### European Mail is Obstructed, Only the Pacific Line is Available

After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Shanghai-Europe postal transport was severely affected. The Siberian and Suez lines have become difficult to reach. The post office currently has a batch of mail that was sent to Europe via Siberia. It is unknown whether it will be successfully transported. It is waiting for a notification from the Soviet post office. In the future, only the Pacific line will be available. British and American mail will be transported via this line.

Chinese Sailboat Anchored in New York

The American "Times" weekly and the "New York Times" published on June 26th and 28th respectively, both published a photograph of a Chinese sailboat anchored in New York Harbor. (See picture) The sail is decorated with the words United China Relief - a joint organization of American aid to China groups, which is currently raising US$5 million to help Chinese refugees. The sailboat is called the "Xiamen" and is made of camphor wood, 70 feet long, and bamboo nails are used to join the joints. The sail is dark red, because it has been soaked in cow blood. Before the Sino-Japanese Incident, the "Xiamen" departed from Guangdong for the United States, making the heroic feat of crossing the Pacific Ocean in 87 days. The current exhibition is open to the public, with the proceeds going to help the motherland. People in New York are very enthusiastic about visiting, with hundreds of people every day paying US$0.25 to board the sailboat and take a look.

### The Manager of the Great America Evening News, Li Junying, was Killed Yesterday, Shot and Killed on the Bund in the French Concession, The Body is Scheduled to be placed in a Coffin Tomorrow Afternoon

At noon yesterday, an assassination case occurred on the Bund of the French Concession. The assassinated victim did not have any documents with him at the time, so his name was not known for a while. Later, it was found out that he was Li Junying, the manager of the Great America Evening News. The details of the bloody case are recorded below:

Appointed Manager After Zhang's Death

Li Junying was 40 years old and from Suzhou. He previously served as the director of the business department of the Great America Evening News. After the manager of the newspaper, Zhang Sixu, was assassinated and killed last year, Li immediately took over the position and continued until today.

Shot in the Head and Died Immediately

At 12:45 PM yesterday, Li left the newspaper office and walked leisurely. When he walked to the entrance of the Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd. Barge Company office at No. 2 Edward Road on the Bund, a murderer suddenly shot him once, hitting the head, and he immediately fell in a pool of blood. He was seriously injured and died.

Dressed Like a Merchant

The murderer disappeared after his purpose was achieved. The Merlin Police learned of the incident and immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to search the scene, but found nothing. The body of Li was transported to the coroner's office. It was found that he only had 118 yuan of legal tender and a gold watch on his body, and nothing else. He was wearing a light gray palice long gown and a white silk shirt and trousers, looking like an upper-class merchant.

The Remains Will Be Placed in a Coffin Tomorrow

However, the police need to know who he is, so they sent detectives to investigate after the incident. It was not until the evening that it was found out that he was Li Junying. He was notified to Li's family to identify the body, which was indeed Mr. Li. According to news from Li's family last night, Li's remains will be placed in a coffin at the Yuguo Funeral Home at 4:00 PM on the 25th of this month. He is survived by his wife, Ms. Ye, and three sons and one daughter. He lived at No. [omitted] on Remi Road in the French Concession.

### 赤木家屬抵滬

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the stepmother of Akagi Chikanori, the Japanese Deputy Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Akagi Hisano, and her brother Sugihara Chikakazu arrived in Shanghai on the 21st aboard the Nagasaki Maru. They are staying at 827 Yuyuan Road, Akagi's residence. According to Hisano, on the 17th, at lunchtime, she was weeding in the garden when a maid led a guest into the room and showed her a newspaper. It said Akagi had been assassinated in Shanghai. She immediately went to the Sugihara house to inquire, and a telegram arrived from Shanghai, confirming the fact. She said, "His decision to die in the line of duty fulfills his wish. Even as a child, he was extremely stubborn. At the time of the assassination," according to Sugihara, "he had four brothers. The eldest brother died at the age of twenty, and the youngest brother died at the age of seven. Only Akagi and I remained. Now Akagi has been assassinated. Thinking of the past, I am extremely saddened."

### 商務印書館　定期復業

The Commercial Press, China's largest cultural institution, experienced a work stoppage on April 22 of this year, when all employees demanded improved treatment, but their demands were not met. Business has been suspended as a result for more than two months. Although various parties mediated during the strike period, no agreement was reached. Recently, Ms. Xing De of the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council mediated again, and a solution was finally reached. However, the number of employees laid off still reached more than 550. Currently, the capitalists are paying them their salaries and actively reorganizing internally, with a scheduled resumption of operations on July 1st. The long-standing labor unrest at the Commercial Press has finally come to an end. The Shanghai Rotary Club's regular meeting this week will be the last meeting of this term and a closed meeting. At that time, new members will be introduced, and the new officers for 1941-1942 will take office. It is said that the meeting place will still be at the Capital Hotel, and the time will be noon on June 16 (Thursday). Out-of-town members are welcome to attend.

### 美郵輪公司　訂定各輪航期　惟船名及行程保持秘密

Regarding the cruise ships of the American President Lines that sail to the Far East and around the world, the United States Maritime Commission decided that seven ships, including the Coolidge, Pierce, Taft, Cleveland, Jackson, Hayes, and Adams, would be slightly adapted for military use. In order to cope with this extraordinary situation, the company has cancelled all previously scheduled voyages. The names of the ships are also kept secret. All sectors attach great importance to this measure of the company. However, according to what the reporter learned from the person in charge of the company yesterday, the cancellation of the previous schedule is not extremely serious, but only a necessary step for the company to redeploy ships. As for restoring the schedules of the ships, the company has decided. The following is a record:

New Schedules Have Been Decided

As for the schedules of the ships in the future, the company decided yesterday: (A) Ships sailing to the United States: (1) The first week of July, (2) the last week of August, (3) the last week of September. (B) Ships sailing to the Philippines: (1) The second week of August, (2) the last week of August, (3) the second week of September. As for the names of the ships and the specific schedules, in order to facilitate the travel of the ships to ensure the safety of the ships in times of emergency, they will not be made public for the time being. Passengers can purchase tickets and negotiate freight transportation at the company's office at 51 Guangdong Road, telephone 15309. The company also manages American joint transportation affairs.

Two Cargo Ships Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

The cargo ship Hubbard managed by the company (belonging to the Oriental Gulf Steamship Company) arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, passing through the Panama Canal from New Orleans, USA, across the Pacific Ocean. It berthed at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. The ship carried 3,100 tons of cargo.

### 郵局鉅刦案　贜款已經點收　被刧之款極少數已無着　日方尚須拘捕本案餘犯

The Shanghai Postal Administration's major robbery case, since being solved by the Japanese Kenpeitai, all the stolen money has also been recovered. According to a Datong News Agency reporter yesterday, the stolen money was officially returned to the post office for counting at the end of last week. The details are as follows:

Stolen Money Returned

In the major robbery case of the Shanghai Postal Administration, after the Japanese side solved the case and recovered all the stolen money, the Japanese side did not return it to the post office for counting. Since the Japanese side released Wang Xuchu, the director of the Savings and Remittance Bureau's cashier section, one of the six suspects escorted, ten weeks ago, they finally returned all the stolen money at the end of last week for the post office to count. It can be said that it was almost all of it, and only a very small amount was spent after being robbed, which is considered fortunate.

Two People Heavily Suspected

As for those who are still being held by the Japanese, there are three old clerks and two bodyguards from the Savings and Remittance Bureau, a total of five people. It is said that two of them are heavily suspected, and the Japanese side still needs to arrest the criminals involved in the case, so there is no hope of release for the time being. Wang Xuchu, who was released, was quite frightened during his detention and felt unwell. He has now asked the bureau for leave and is recuperating in the hospital. As for the headquarters' handling of the aftermath of this case, there has been no reply to Shanghai.

### 高乃依路　一人被捕　　亨利路所捕兩人　　昨已由虹口回家

The Japanese side dispatched personnel to cooperate with the French police to arrest a Chinese man in his forties at No. 1 Avenue Corneille on the 21st. He was immediately escorted to the Hongkou area. At the same time, they went to No. 6, Lane 100, Rue Henri, to arrest a man, but he did not live in that residence and could not be arrested. Later, they arrested his wife and maid and escorted them to Hongkou. They were released and returned home yesterday. The names of those arrested are unknown.

### 向淪陷區推銷　冒牌襯衫　永興祥洋服店主　咋經法院判罰金

Yongxin Underwear Company at 702 Xiaohuayuankou Road, Zhejiang Road (currently located at 212 Hubei Road, issuing office; manufacturing plant at 20, Lane 347, Weihaiwei Road) was opened by Chen Xunquan. Its trademark and various shirts produced have been registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and are sold exclusively in the mainland. Recently, the Ministry of Finance learned that goods produced by Yongxin were suddenly being sold in various occupied areas, so it instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce

To Investigate Yongxin

Yongxin was deeply puzzled when it learned of this, because its goods had not been sold to the occupied areas. It was obvious that someone was deceiving people. After a detailed investigation, it was discovered that Yongxingxiang Tailor Shop at 728 Chengdu Road was counterfeiting the name of Yongxin Underwear Company to sell its shirts. In the middle of last month, it sent a partner to Yongxingxiang to purchase a standard cloth shirt. The words "Product of Yongxin Underwear Company" were written on the surface. He took it to the Xinzha Police Station to report it. Yesterday, Chinese detective Li Yinmin was sent to arrest Yan Yongtang, the owner of Yongxingxiang, and confiscated four counterfeit shirts. He took him to the police station. According to Yan's confession, this matter was done by his brother

Yan Yongbiao's Doing

Because Yan's family lived at No. 73 Avenue Messimy in the French Concession, he cooperated with detectives from the French police station to arrest Yan Yongbiao and confiscated 34 standard cloth shirts. They were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted according to law, and Yongxin Underwear Company hired lawyer Jiang Pingfan to appear in court, incidentally filing a civil suit, requesting compensation for losses of more than 30,000 yuan. Questioning the defendants, their statements were evasive. Judge Qiu sentenced Yan Yongtang and Yan Yongbiao to a joint intention to deceive others and forge a registered trademark, and each fined them 800 yuan. If they were to perform labor in lieu of payment, the fine would be converted at a rate of six months for the total amount of the fine. The 38 confiscated shirts were confiscated, and the incidental civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial.

### 白克路　無頭女屍　死者爲曾梁氏　昔爲書寓名妓

On the 7th of this month, a bundle of calico cotton was found on the street near Baker Road, Behe Road, Xinzha District. The Chinese patrolman who was patrolling the street untied it and saw that it was a section of a corpse. The corpse was female, and its limbs and head had been cut off. It was determined that it had been murdered and dismembered before death. The Xinzha Police Station was notified to send detectives to investigate. Later, the father found the two feet and one hand of the corpse in the river. They were all transported to the morgue for examination. The body was identified, and an order was issued to arrest the murderer. It is now known that after a detailed investigation by the police authorities of the Public Concession, the deceased was identified as Zeng Liangshi, a native of Suzhou, 42 years old. She used to be a prostitute in a brothel, taking the name Laoqi. She lived at No. 12 He'anfang, Changsha Road. She had some savings.

### 糧食　只有米遇惟恐天下不亂　將米價抬高近十元　不要興高采烈要知世事變化無窮

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice rose and fell at first. The market saw drastic changes again, rising and falling sharply. Although affected by changes in the international situation, it was all caused by speculators taking advantage of the wind and waves and trying their best to manipulate it. If based on inventory, then this city does not need to worry about running out of rice within half a year, and orders arrive continuously, without interruption. How can there be a risk of interruption? The two concessions are determined to maintain it and will never allow citizens to be exploited by treacherous elements again. Speculators hoarding and borrowing fake port rice rumors to confuse people, how can they know that they will not suffer the pain of crying and laughing when the price of rice in the upper concession was four yuan last time? Only yesterday, the early market continued the rising trend of last week. Buying sentiment was extremely strong. Local Ningbo and Shaoxing merchants rushed to handle it first, and hoarders rushed to handle it later. The opening price in the morning immediately soared. No. 1 Saigon was as high as 135.5 yuan for a large grain, 129 yuan for a small grain, 155 yuan for an English-Chinese small grain, and 124 yuan for broken rice. This price was 4-5 yuan higher than the closing price on Saturday night, and 8-9 yuan higher than the closing price on Saturday noon. After the market price soared, floating profits began to come out. Coupled with rumors of peace, the market was not good for the goods side, and the market turned sharply down by 2-3.5 yuan. Small grain English-Chinese was 144.6 yuan, 150 yuan, Buy Bu Xiaozhi was 152.5 yuan, broken rice was 121 yuan to 118.5 yuan, and 6-7 months was 119 yuan to 117.5 yuan. There were also new transactions of 1,000 tons of No. 1 Siam at 240 pounds, with a transaction price of 145 yuan. There were also multiple contacts for other broken rice. In the afternoon, the selling sentiment was stronger, and floating profits were thinking of depreciating. The market price had a trend of turning sharply downward, but trading was prohibited in the afternoon, and the market closed early without a transaction.

The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Yongsheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson arrived in Shanghai from India the day before yesterday (June 22). After inspection, it was found to be loaded with 9,950 bags of the Shanghai Municipal Council's fair-priced foreign rice and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (Zu)

Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica rice is still not weak, the price of foreign rice has soared, and people's hearts are unanimously trending upward. Sales in local stores have turned smoothly, and sellers' shouting is also fierce. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice have all been increased by 5 yuan. The opening price of fresh early rice from Kai'nan Port was 139 yuan, followed by 134 yuan, 132-3 yuan for old original bags, and 132 yuan for Wuxi original bag old seeds. Glutinous rice was immediately responded to and followed suit. Hong Kong Gao Yuan opened at 125-4 yuan and finally reached 121 yuan. Lu opened at 114-5 yuan and finally reached 111-2 yuan, with an increase of 5-6 yuan. However, due to the distance between the quality of domestic glutinous rice and the weather, the road is more stagnant. Although the increase is insufficient, the opening price of Gao Huozi is 130 yuan, and the middle price is 126-7 yuan, an increase of 2-3 yuan.

### 麵粉猛升疾退

The market for foreign flour first rose and then fell. The opening price in the morning was stimulated by the international war clouds. In the midst of the rising prices in the rice market, domestic buyers absorbed quite a lot, but the actual sales were not strong. Jinlong flour opened at 33.1 yuan, an increase of 6-7 jiao from the previous day. Then, with the loosening of the rice market and changes in the Pacific situation, people's hearts were confused and uncertain. Generally, floating positions took advantage of the high price to come out. The market rose sharply and then fell sharply. Jinlong flour immediately loosened to 32.7 yuan, and the closing price was only 31.3 yuan. The price of Paotai flour rose from 30.6 yuan back to 33.3 yuan. As a result, it was the same as the closing price at the end of last week. The total transaction was more than 20,000 bags. The future of the market still depends on how the actual sales are.

The wheat trade was even more silent, because the new wheat in the mainland had already been controlled and could not come to Shanghai for a while. Even the goods thrown by the Japanese factories, it is heard that the price of Shanghai flour is now high and the production price of new wheat is also high, so it is even more difficult to plan for transportation. Therefore, there is no hope for the development of the market for the time being.

### 雜糧油餅　漲風頓挫

Yesterday's market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes continued the tight rising situation of last Saturday. Various market prices still rose. However, the international situation changed suddenly, and there were no special actions in the Far East. Generally, hat-snatching floating hoarders took the opportunity to come out, so the trend was reversed downward. The falling trend of bean cake revived, falling by 4-5 jiao compared with the end of last week. It is estimated that there were more than 18,000 pieces of Shengji cake, with a price of 17.2-1 jiao for the lower warehouse order in May and 17.6-7 jiao for the upper warehouse order in June and the lower delivery in June. It then fell back to 17.5 yuan, 17.6 jiao for the lower warehouse order in June and the upper delivery in July, and then fell to 17.85 jiao. In addition, the guild will close the afternoon market during the summer vacation from June 25 to the end of August. The full day business will resume as usual from September 1.

### 金融　蘇德戰事爆發　華商一度結進外滙

Foreign exchange was in chaos yesterday. HSBC's listed prices did not change. The black market for the British and American exchange rates was tight at first and then suddenly loosened. It was heard that the Soviet-German war had broken out, and Chinese merchants and speculators tended to buy in, causing the Central Gold to soften to 3 pence 3.125. The US dollar was less willing to supply at the banks, and the recent 5.375 yuan was also difficult to settle. However, after HSBC listed its prices without changing, the speculative buying intention gradually faded, and Japanese companies such as Mitsui came to sell, and the market was loosening. When there was news of American mobilization and so-called peace atmosphere, speculators turned to sell, and the situation became cheaper. In the afternoon, the buying and selling of speculators and Japanese banks were inconsistent, and the transaction was slightly lively. The situation was still stable. The closing price was the same as the price on Saturday. The total transaction was quite large, and speculators squeezed out slightly.

Buying Intention Gradually Faded at Noon

Since this morning, the foreign exchange market, the British and American markets, and the Indian silver market have not changed. The exchange rates between Britain and the United States have not changed. The opening selling price of banks in the domestic market was 3 pence 3.125 for spot British gold and 5.40625 yuan for the US dollar, which was higher than the closing price of the previous Saturday afternoon, 0.05625 for the British tight and 0.03125 for the US tight. This was because the Soviet-German war broke out. Chinese merchants and speculators came to buy in and settle the July US dollar at 5.40625 yuan. After Guohua supplied and settled, they bought in and settled at 5.375 yuan. The tightest settlement was difficult at the above price. After HSBC listed its prices without changing, the silver bull tax was still 24.15%. The speculative buying intention gradually faded, and the market situation also hardened to 5.40625 yuan. The willingness of foreign merchant banks to supply was slightly better. Mitsui, a Japanese company, suddenly came to sell the July 5.40625 and 5.4375. Speculators also sold at the same price. Under the negative news, it was easier to sell the market at noon. It was already possible to settle. The closing price of British gold at noon also hardened to 3 pence 3.28125 and the US dollar to 5.4375 yuan.

Inconsistent Buying and Selling in the Afternoon

In the afternoon, speculators' buying and selling were inconsistent. They bought Mitsui's July 5.4375 and sold the same month at the same price. The market situation was very stable. Japanese banks also came to buy back the current US dollar at 5.4375 in the afternoon. The changes were still small. Until the closing at 3:30, the spot to July futures were all 3 pence 3.28125 for the British exchange and 5.4375 yuan for the US dollar, which were the same as the closing price on Saturday afternoon.

### 經濟談

— Feng Liu

Economic Talk (I)

Easy to talk about economics? Economics books, filled with sweat; the name of economics, known to women and children: Why must I talk about what I talk about, or even what people have not talked about, or even what people cannot talk about; as for what I talk about, it is another problem. I only know to prepare a theory, to open up a field, for later exploration, that is, the intention of making economic discussions is also based on this.

Economics is an original Chinese word. Since Japan used it to translate Economics, it has gradually lost its original meaning in China. So what is the original meaning in China? This is because the predecessors have not made a clear interpretation. I want to prepare one late, so I have to make a review and form my own theory.

I think the "經" in 經濟 comes from the Doctrine of the Mean, which says:

"There are nine constants (經) in managing the empire and the state: cultivating one's own character; honouring men of virtue; loving one's relatives; respecting the great ministers; considering the body of officers; cherishing all the people as children; encouraging the resort of all classes of artisans; showing tenderness to strangers from distant parts; and conciliating the princes of the empire."

However, the "經" of the nine constants is still the "經" of constant, which has the same meaning as the "經" of the great constants of the world. However, although economics is an abstract noun, if analyzed, it is all composed of two verbs connected together; it is not the "經" of constant. Therefore, the Doctrine of the Mean also says: (To be continued)

### 投機心思不定　金市大漲大落　最高六四五〇元　收前六三六二元

Yesterday, the black market for gold fluctuated greatly, starting with a sharp rise and then a step-by-step fall, which was quite unexpected. It was all due to the stimulation of domestic and foreign news and rumors. After breaking through the 6,400 yuan mark, it returned. People's hearts were unsettled and turned from firm to tired. Since the morning, due to the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, foreign news spread that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were allied. Therefore, in a unanimous buying frenzy, the high price of 6,450 yuan was heard, which was suppressed by the concerted efforts of Jin Hao Chengji and Yin Hao Hengji. Foreign exchange suddenly returned from tight, and securities companies Kang Yong, Yida (returned), Xianghe successively scrambled to come out, and it was rumored that the United States was mobilizing and that there was a certain atmosphere. Retail investors in Shanghai West came to sell. At noon, the price returned to 6,400 yuan. In the afternoon, cash companies and Yiyun also sold, and the low price of 6,362 yuan was seen. Finally, scattered short positions that had made profits were covered, and the closing price was slightly raised, still squeezed up by 5 yuan. The total transaction was 50,000 to 60,000 taels. The seller of the rollover (June to July) gave the buyer 57 yuan, and now it is seeing fatigue and falling. In the morning, Bei Qingyun entered with great fanfare 10 taels, and the price was 300 yuan higher than the futures delivery price. Wanfeng entered Yongfengyu with 60 taels, 330 yuan higher. In the afternoon, it was 250 yuan higher, and there were buyers who squeezed 20 yuan. The price of gold ornaments and so on remained flat.

Futures First Rises and Then Falls

Since this morning, every item (10 taels) was due to the war in the Soviet-German war, people's hearts were extremely firm, and foreign exchange was tightening. Therefore, although Hengji was seen selling fiercely, the price flew out of 6,400 yuan in a unanimous buying frenzy. The opening price at 9:15 was 6,420 yuan, 45 yuan higher than the closing price on Saturday afternoon. Yida, Jinyuan, Deyi, Shihe, etc. scrambled to absorb, and scattered orders picked up wildly. The price rose by 30 yuan to 6,450 yuan. Xinfengyong, Chengji, Tong Kangyong, Yida saw the high price and came back to sell, and the July US dollar could be settled at 5.40625. The price immediately fell by 35 yuan to 6,415 yuan. At that time, Gongda and Xinfengyong absorbed, and the scattered orders raised the price to 6,435 yuan. Later, under the selling trend of the gold and securities gangs, the price gradually declined. Near noon, there were rumors of American mobilization and a certain atmosphere. The market situation became more virtual. Yida, Xinyuan, Xianghe, and Tong Kangyong sold hard, and the price entered 6,400 yuan, falling by 60 yuan and retreating to 6,375 yuan. The closing price at noon was 6,378 yuan. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the opening price was 88 yuan lower, at 6,370 yuan. Tong Kangyong, Jufengyong, and retail investors came to strenuously buy in and raised the price to 6,383 yuan, which was sold by Yiyun Hesheng. Short positions were squeezed to a low of 6,362 yuan. Finally, Gongda and retail investors covered their positions, and the price rose slightly.

According to the settlement price of the July US dollar at 5.4375, it was 6,404.6 yuan, a squeeze of 4.6 yuan. On that day, the company's brand gold with a difference of 88 yuan in cash was sold at a price 80 yuan higher than the futures delivery price. The closing price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the current standard gold.

The Price of Gold Ornaments Remains Unchanged

The price of gold ornaments and jewelry per tael in pawnshops is still 695 yuan at Datongxing and Xintongxing (40 yuan less for collection), it is said.

### 外幣市况平定

Yesterday's foreign currency market, the price of chafu rose and then leveled off, and the price of British and American gold also rose and then leveled off. The British gold ticket remained stable, so the market price leveled off. The futures US dollar ticket once reached 18.5 yuan, and finally closed at 18.33 yuan, an increase of 0.03 yuan compared with the previous week. The spot price must be reduced by about 0.15 yuan according to the above price. The price of Hong Kong tickets rose and then leveled off. The Japanese gold ticket and the Korean ticket remained unchanged. The former still stood at the original sound of 1.88 yuan, and the latter was still 1.5 yuan.

### Securities Internal Debt Shines Again, Almost to the Point of Being Only Buyers and No Sellers

In the unofficial market for public bonds yesterday, due to the official declaration of war between Germany and the Soviet Union and the trend of an alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which is extremely beneficial to China, the bond market turned bullish again. The situation gradually became stronger, and Class C bonds even broke the high record of January 22nd of this year. The situation became even more heated. Previous bulls either increased their positions or remained unchanged, while new bulls emerged from time to time. There were not many sellers emerging; only those with no real strength selling speculatively and sporadic retail sales. The market situation was tense, almost to the point of being only buyers and no sellers. As the transfer interest matured, the shorts had no choice but to cover their positions painfully. For a time, chips were exhausted, and Class C bonds saw new highs. Other types of bonds could not be an exception. Currently, in the market, most people expect Class C bonds to reach 75 yuan. The buying by Tiansheng yesterday morning was the most enthusiastic, as if adding a new force to the market. Xinfu Hongda consistently adhered to its principle of continuing to buy. Lianyi Dechang Xiexing's appetite was also not weak. The selling pressure from Tongkang and Xiekang was not strong, and the supply and demand still felt disparate. Before noon, internal bonds saw a new high price of three yuan. In the afternoon, Tiansheng and Xinfu's appetite did not weaken, and Renfeng also had demand. Xinchang and Xiekang supplied market prices and continued to improve. As a result, they all went back up eight or nine jiao, xin one yuan, and one jiao and a half. The transaction amount was more than two million yuan. A concise table is listed below, and the highest price on January 22nd is attached to the table for reference.

Unified A: 81.65

Unified B: 75.90

Unified Internal: 72.30

Unified D: 70.45

Unified E: 71.05

Stock trading: 300 shares of Hanyang Iron and Steel Company were traded at a price of 5 yuan, 7 jiao and a half.

The stock market of the Public Industry Association opened, and buying interest was strong. The price rose much more than the previous close. There was a slight reaction afterward, but it immediately recovered, and several closed at the highest price. Asian shares had the most transactions, opening at 13 yuan and 3 jiao, falling to 12 yuan and 88 jiao, and then gradually rising to a high price of 15 yuan, closing at 14 yuan and 7 jiao. British Union shares opened at 31 yuan and had transactions, trading all day around 30 yuan. The closing price was 29 yuan and 7 jiao. Rubber shares also rose sharply, but there were not many transactions. Most of the transactions belonged to British Chartered and Langezhi.

### Yarn and Cloth European War Expands, Yarn Prices Jump Wildly

The yarn market is trending strong, and the bullish trend is quite intense. This is because sales in Hong Kong are very strong. More than 3,000 packages of 22 and 20 count yarn were bought, and the price rose by 20 to 30 yuan. As a result, people's hearts were shaken, and shorts rushed to cover their positions. The market rose sharply. Some people in the market said that the Shuangma factory was short on single-drawn yarn and must watch for 1,600 yuan. Therefore, the popularity was enthusiastic, and the peak reached 1,565 yuan. However, those who made profits spit out a lot, and there was a setback in the middle. However, raw materials are becoming more expensive every day, the factory's costs are increasing, and the demand is not weak. The high price for 20 count Shuangma was 1,565 yuan, and the low price was 1,540 yuan. The initial trade in the afternoon was 1,545 yuan, falling to 1,541 yuan. Later, due to large accounts being pulled in, it rose to 1,549 yuan. However, the gold price was flat, and it loosened to 1,543 yuan again. The final price was 1,547 or 8 yuan. In the afternoon, it was rumored that a chartered yarn shop had run aground.

The opening of Shuangma in the morning was tense because the report said that the Soviet-German war had broken out, and many said it was bullish. Buying was very enthusiastic. The opening price was 1,540 yuan and 1 jiao. Buyers flocked to buy, and it jumped straight to 1,565 yuan. Subsequently, the margin fell, and the bulls closed out, loosening to 1,540 yuan again. However, sales developed with more than 3,000 packages being bought, and it returned to 1,545 yuan to close. It was found that the sales statistics were 15,000 packages, of which 3,000 packages were bought by the Hong Kong gang, and 11,000 packages were intra-day scalping.

Shuangma Term Yarn Cloth Situation: The opening price jumped wildly. The first lot for July was priced at 1,440 yuan, up 35 yuan. Subsequently, those who made profits sold and gradually came back down. However, the momentum was still high. The market trend in the afternoon was ordinary. As a result, the July lot rose 12 yuan and a half, and the August lot rose 11 yuan. It was found that 8,950 packages of Shuangma term yarn were traded in the morning, and 3,430 packages were traded in the afternoon. The total for the whole day was 12,380 packages. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left.

### Factory Numbers Wait and See, Cotton Prices' Future Uncertain

Yesterday, cotton cloth prices were difficult to predict due to the sudden changes in the international situation. Factories and most traders turned to wait and see. The buying interest was not as strong as last week, but the holders saw that foreign cotton continued to rise, and yarn sales were good. Shuangma soared, relying on the hope of higher prices. The same industry traded 925 pieces and 390 packages between each other, and the price rose by 1 to 2 yuan. The opening and closing prices are listed on the left.

Middling: 477.0 Trader: 100 pieces

Fine velvet packed: 297.5 and 125 pieces

Fine velvet grass packed: 270.0 and 140 packages

Amra: 217.5 and 100 pieces

Lancashire flower: 215. and 500 pieces

and 126.5 and 100 pieces

Fire flower: 195.0 and 150 packages

Indian cotton has arrived in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng Wheel arrived at the port the day before yesterday (Sunday), carrying 1,000 pieces of cotton from Calcutta, India, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload.

Another message: The foreign cotton trading of Shanghai's foreign firms is lively and the transactions are not bad. However, because the international situation is becoming more acute and the European war is frequently expanding, some people feel slightly indifferent. Only the various flower shops are still enthusiastic about ordering Brazilian cotton. The New York cotton market first fell due to the good cotton harvest, but then rose again due to purchases by spot traders and the same industry. As a result, the closing price rose by 90 pounds.

The Indian cotton market first rose due to speculative buying, and then fell due to sales by brokers and profit-taking by bulls. Finally, it rose again due to strong foreign markets and buying by the same industry. The closing price yesterday rose by 4 to 5 rupees. It is also predicted that the opening market situation today will be bullish by one and a half rupees.

### Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Morning Market's Arrogance Boundless Afternoon Suddenly Turns Downstream

Factory cloth: Yesterday's market trend was uncertain because the situation was turbulent and people were bewildered. The morning opening was the most arrogant, and the asking price was rising. White goods increased by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece, and bleached and dyed cloth also jumped up by about 1 yuan per piece. However, it suddenly turned downstream in the afternoon, falling back by 1 jiao to 5 jiao per piece. This is due to the lack of spot sales and the wait-and-see attitude of hoarding households. The Muk street transaction had more than 300 pieces of gray cloth, printed cloth, and blue cloth. The Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs sold more than 100 pieces of Shilin cloth and khaki. The Nanyang gang sold more than 100 pieces of bleached cloth and colored cloth. The Northern Road Yanjin gang sold 70 to 80 pieces of colored cloth and 16-pound coarse cloth.

Eastern Cloth: The rise and fall are rapid and the fluctuations are huge. The morning opening was due to the declaration of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, and yarn prices soared. Short accounts were panicked, and new bulls added positions. The futures of fine cloth in the exchange rose sharply by 1 yuan and 6 jiao per piece. In the spot market, the highest transaction price for Longtou fine cloth was 48 yuan. The Four Gentlemen Serge factory orders rose to 1 yuan, 6 jiao, 1 fen, and 7 and a half, but soon after, rumors of international bad news arose, and the margin and Shuangma fell together, causing the chess pieces to be uncertain. Scattered shorts also followed suit and sold off. The opening of the market in the afternoon was even more chaotic. However, fine cloth was active due to the actual needs of dyeing factories, and 400 to 500 packages of various mid-range brands were traded. The exchange did not fall much, but the first order factory orders fell by 5 jiao compared to Saturday. The closing price was 46 yuan and 6 jiao. The Four Gentlemen Serge warehouse orders were still tight, and the same industry bought more than they sold. The closing price rebounded to 1 yuan, 5 jiao, 7 fen, and 2 li and a half, falling 1 fen and 7 li.

### Silk and Tea Silk Market Quite Dull

Yesterday, there was no market in New York. The spot price in Yokohama was 1,630 yuan, 637 yuan for the recent June lot, and 1,558 yuan for the distant November lot. Since arriving in the port, the Shanghai silk market has been quite dull. Only gray warp has been traded slightly, priced at around 1,600. On the 23rd, a box of rayon came from Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market Sugar Trend Still Strong

Yesterday, the sugar market association had a dramatic session. The opening price for 24 coarse white spot goods arriving in June was 92 yuan to 3 jiao, and in the afternoon, it was 91 yuan, 4 jiao to 2 jiao. The price for January arrivals was 80 yuan, March arrivals were 88 yuan and 5 jiao, and April was 89 yuan to 88 yuan. The Taikoo Granulated B Mark East Bund was 106 yuan to 6 yuan and 4 jiao, the DY Mark East Bund was 95 yuan, 6 jiao to 2 jiao, the HX Mark East Bund opened at 90 yuan to 05 jiao, the Dutch Red KD Mark was 73 yuan, and the HT Mark was 68 yuan and 5 jiao. The trend is still good. On the 23rd, 198 packages of sugar came from Hong Kong.

### Seafood Arrival of Domestic Mushrooms Eastern Activities Turn Upward

Due to the difficulty in sourcing domestic fragrant mushrooms and winter mushrooms, there have been no further arrivals recently, so Cambodian goods are quite active. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, a flower-patterned winter mushroom opened at 1,355 yuan, a orchid winter mushroom opened at 1,331 yuan, a red three jade mark was counter-offered at 1,350 yuan, a Tianlan was offered at 1,335 yuan, and a fragrant cap was offered at 1,405 yuan. Because it is calculated according to cost, it is still insufficient, and the traders' safeguards have not been opened. It can be seen that the market will inevitably continue to tighten.

### Coal Shortage of Number One Small Size

Hongji Number One Small Size has been in absolute shortage lately due to the lack of arrivals. A certain foreign firm in the French Concession only has uniform particles, resulting in a gradual rise in high-end prices. However, Yitai Xing and Nanyang have slightly more new goods of the original small size being loaded, adding embellishment to the market. Self-wheeled by the industry is 450 yuan per ton. The front store of this street sells Number One Small Size for 454 yuan per ton and retail for 12 yuan and 7 jiao per load.

### Yisheng Table Tennis Team Anniversary Chinese and Western Celebrities Perform Grand Competition Has Its Own Merits

The table tennis performance convention held by the Yisheng Table Tennis Team to celebrate its fourth anniversary was held at the factory at No. 83 Binliu Road the day before yesterday afternoon. Although it was drizzling, there were more than 700 guests, making it a very grand occasion. The venue was large and luxuriously decorated. There were more than 20 souvenirs such as silver cups given by various parties, which were dazzling. First, Tu Daolin reported on the significance of the event, followed by speeches by factory director Li Baosheng and Mr. Mao Zongyao. The performance then began. The first match was between Qibu against a Russian businessman. Qibu was the originator of hard ball competitions throughout Shanghai. Qibu general Weng Zhichao was absent without cause, and Hu Yiping was late, which affected the strength. General Fan Han was not used, and Xu Junyan, a retired team member, was sent out instead, resulting in a failed outcome. As a result, the Russian businessman defeated Qibu three to two by a small margin. Coach Chen Linsheng arrived to supervise the battle, but it was too late. The second match was between Hualian Women against Yisheng A. The female generals did not show any weakness. Lin Jinlan, Cai Xiuyu, Yan Wenjun, Xiao Weiqing, and others all had excellent performances. As a result, Yisheng won three to two by a small margin. Finally, famous players from the strong Shanghai teams Huayi Qingyun Wenhua Hongzhang and others were added to the mixed performance, with wonderful results. After the performance, Mr. Chen Linsheng gave a thank you speech and the event closed. The complete results are as follows:

### Male Students Commit Robbery, Female Students Commit Suicide

— Xiao Yun

Recently, the newspapers reported two social news stories related to the education sector, with students as the protagonists. Two male students, addicted to gambling, summoned a female guide to a hotel to rob her. Another pair of female students committed suicide by taking poison because they failed their exams.

These two regrettable incidents, happening to young students, cannot but make society open its eyes and feel concerned. Especially those in the education sector, whose duty is to cultivate people, should reflect deeply and find ways to remedy the situation.

In the case of the incident of becoming addicted to gambling and ending up robbing a female guide, a large part is certainly due to the relationship of making friends carelessly and being tempted by bad environment. However, our school authorities have failed to give students the strength to resist temptation, have not taught them how to use their free time to engage in activities that are beneficial to personal cultivation or social welfare, and have not given them vaccinations to resist depravity. This dereliction of duty is undeniable. As for the tragedy of taking poison because of failing exams, it is entirely a matter of thought. The school authorities do not make students understand that the purpose of reading is not just to pass exams. At the same time, the school does not have a solution to life's problems that can make students feel convinced, so that they can question and ask for help when they encounter difficulties.

Of course, under these special circumstances, the school authorities have many practical difficulties. It is unfair to place all the responsibility on educators. However, what better way is there?

After the student robbery incident was published, the authorities of both schools quickly wrote letters to various newspapers to "correct" the news, saying that there were no students with those names in their schools. For the sake of completely preserving the school's reputation, this is naturally an irreproachable move. However, we believe that what is more important and more in need of correction is the school's own disciplinary methods.

### The Effect of Color

— Si Zhong

A certain packing factory in Chicago heard that if the white walls of the sample room in the factory were changed to another color, the sales performance would definitely improve, but at first, they were reluctant to believe it. However, a color matching expert in New York told the factory owner that the white walls leave a gray impression in the customers' eyes, so the bright red meat naturally loses its color. Also, the yellow sawdust on the ground makes people feel bluish after looking at other things for a long time. The remedy is to change the walls and all kinds of things in the house to blue-green, so that the fresh beef will appear more rosy, and the fat and bones will appear whiter. This method resulted in a sharp increase in business, so the company repainted all 365 sample rooms across the country in the same way. Other companies also followed suit.

Tea houses should also pay attention to color. A restaurant in the western United States changed to using green bowls to hold lettuce, so all kinds of lettuce appeared larger and more lovely green. However, for the entire restaurant, colors that give a warm feeling, such as red, yellow, orange, etc., are more likely to make diners relax and open their wallets.

The white paint in hospitals should be changed to dark green. Doctors and nurses should change to wearing green uniforms. This can enable doctors to concentrate their energy even for a long time when facing strong lights in the operating room. The term "white-clothed nurse" may become a thing of the past.

The Chicago Board of Education has set up 28 "eye-saving classrooms" specifically for children with poor eyesight to attend classes. The classrooms are equipped with green chalkboards, and yellow chalk is used for writing, which makes students feel relaxed and happy when looking at it. There is a kind of grass-green glass chalkboard, which is as easy to write on as a slate, and has been widely adopted by various schools.

Recently, a manufacturer of office supplies tried to make light green account books, using light brown and dark green lines instead of the conventional red and blue. Accountants found that this kind of account book paper did not refract light, and it was not easy to make mistakes when drawing lines, so they asked the company to adopt it.

About twelve years ago, when the manager of the Ryder Shoe Company in Massachusetts inspected the workshop, a middle-aged machine operator told him that he felt a headache and had black spots in front of his eyes. He looked at the black-painted machines and the black leather shoes in the hands of the workers, and felt that the two things were difficult to distinguish, so he had an inspiration and ordered the workers to choose various colors of paint at will to repaint all the machines. Soon, all the parts in the factory looked like a rainbow, with emerald green, rose red, and violet, colorful and bright. Workers holding black leather shoes work in front of those machines, not easily tired, and the work is meticulous. As a result, accidents were reduced by 70%, and the number of bad shoes was also greatly reduced.

Based on this result, the manager consulted with a color expert and formulated a permanent plan. The fixed parts of the machines are painted light yellow, and the movable parts are painted light green. The lives of hundreds of workers have been extended as a result. Since then, many factories have also paid attention to colorful machines and decoration plans to avoid eye fatigue and fatigue for workers, which is of great benefit to work efficiency and industrial safety.

(9) An Eccentric Farmer

Autumn Begonia nodded in the darkness.

The shop assistant was almost out of the room, but he suddenly thought that his mouth was very dry, and he should drink some water first.

A feeling of shame and indignation instantly swept through Autumn Begonia's body, almost making him want to find a hole in the ground to crawl into immediately. The various ridicule and hatred he had suffered when he first decided to remove the gauze from his face at home two or three years ago unconsciously surged into his mind like a warm old dream.

"There are many ugly people, but there's no ugliness like this!" Wu Da's wife was the first to say this.

"Why did you have to get those two knives chopped on your face for no reason? This guy must not be a good thing!" Zhang San, who lived next door and had a quick tongue, would almost always say this softly to his wife every time he saw him. Until recently, he himself felt that there was no taste in saying it any more, and gradually stopped mentioning it.

"If you suddenly bump into this ugly guy Wu San, you'll really scare people to death..." He had also heard such excessive adjectives more than dozens of times, but they had also gradually subsided recently.

Today, leaving Li's Village, the first person to see his true face was this shop assistant, and the expression revealed by this shop assistant immediately gave him great embarrassment, making him not only remember the various ridicule and insults he had suffered before, but also defeat the courage he had barely mustered to go out.

"The first person I met is already like this, how can I still get on the train and go to Beijing?" He really wanted to go back to Li's Village with Wu Da.

Wu Da had already gotten used to his cousin's ugly face, and secondly, this ugly face did not belong to him at all, so he naturally could not understand the regret and melancholy in Autumn Begonia's heart. (140)

Military Equipment

### A Sharp Weapon for Marching

— Ke Zhong

In modern mechanized warfare, speed is one of the most important factors in marching. The German victory in Europe, the speed of the march is a major reason. In view of this, the Ford Motor Company of the United States recently manufactured a small military vehicle for the United States Army, which can be used as a small truck, a tractor, and a reconnaissance vehicle. This type of vehicle can carry more than three soldiers and is extremely fast. It can travel 60 miles per hour on flat ground, and can move freely even on rugged terrain. This car has four horsepower, is equipped with a machine gun that can rotate freely in all directions, and has a place to store a hand-held machine gun. It is extremely convenient to use this type of vehicle to transport troops, tow mortars and other light artillery, and transport military supplies. The front windshield can be raised and lowered, which is very convenient. There are handles on the side of the car, so when the car gets stuck in the mud, the people in the car can help lift the car up. This is truly a sharp weapon in modern marching.

### Will War Reduce Unemployment?

— Xin Liang

According to a moderate survey by the US Business Commission, the total number of unemployed people in the United States in October 1940 was about 6,650,000; but at present, it is only about 4,400,000. Due to the expansion of various national defense industries, there is a great demand for manpower: the number of unemployed people is constantly decreasing - this may be the only "benefit" that war bestows on us humans.

Even the retired, experienced "old hands" still have to be invited back, and those with specialized knowledge or skills, of course, are not willing to let them run away easily. To this day, even those students who are still studying at school have dropped out of school to work. They see that wages in society are generally increasing, so they are willing to temporarily put aside their books to work. In a certain place, there was a family where only the father earned money at the beginning of 1940. By June of that year, the mother was called back by the company she had previously worked for to be a salesperson. She handed over all the housework to her 18-year-old daughter. By September, this girl had also gotten a typist position, so she put the housekeeping affairs on the maid again. Not long after, their son, who was only 16 years old, was also clamoring, "I don't want to study, I want to work!"

Now in the mainland, aren't we just like this? But here, the easiest thing to think about is whether these workers will be unemployed again in the future? When the war stops and guns and ammunition are no longer needed, won't these people who "eat by war" suffer the pain of unemployment as they did in 1920? From this point of view, we should prepare a long-term plan in advance, so that when they no longer manufacture ammunition, they can immediately start engaging in various practical productions, as a foundation for reconstruction, to rebuild our destroyed fields. This point also seems to be worth considering at present!

### Life Preparation

Don't cram knowledge into students; instead, prepare them so that they can sail clearly on the voyage of life.

### Talking About the Joint Trial of Yu Tang Chun

— Xi Sen

"Yu Tang Chun" is the most popular play in recent years, and all famous female roles attach great importance to it, listing it as one of the best plays. The whole play emphasizes both singing and acting, and the plot is sad and enchanting, which can deeply cater to the psychology of the middle class society.

In the past, the play "Yu Tang Chun" was known to be the most prosperous when Wang Yaoqing performed it. Today, most of them follow the style of Hui Sheng. The tight interweaving of the arrangement and performance of Hui Sheng, and the proper arrangement of the songs, do have the wonderful effect of being consistent from beginning to end. Shang Xiaoyun also has a complete "Yu Tang Chun", focusing on the later stages of prison interrogation, madness, retrial, clarification of injustice, leaving the yamen, and staying at the inn. There are shortcomings of uneven emphasis. Compared with the Xun version, it is far from being able to reach it! The joint trial scene is the most difficult in the entire play. Those who are not good at both singing and acting cannot succeed, and acting is especially important. According to the joint trial scene, almost all of it is sung while kneeling, or it may be thought that there is no body movement to speak of. However, the expression should pay attention to the subtleties, and there are things that must not be ignored. For example, the body movement when the blue-robed official shouts "Look at the beating" must be clean and lively, and correspond to the gongs and drums on the stage to be attractive. Also, when singing the crying board, the trembling of both hands should show fear. Generally, when female roles perform this, their hands are often like clappers, which is also a big taboo. Furthermore, when singing the sentence "Sixteen years old, when I was pregnant with that Wang Gongzi," in addition to expressing a shy and coquettish demeanor, the eyes must also correspond to the two questioners. This sentence is not sung in one breath. In the middle, the interrogator interjects a question, "Wang what?" Otherwise, it will inevitably lose its rigidity. When standing up after the interrogation, the swaying body that is about to fall should match the rhythm of the erhu's slow interlude. All of these are small details, but performers often ignore them. Even the lyrics of the entire scene must have expressions on the face, acting as they sing. Although the scene is monotonous, it will not make the audience feel neglected. In the past, I have seen a famous female Dan perform the joint trial. Her singing voice was very melodious, and her delivery of the tune was very pure. As far as singing is concerned, it is impeccable. However, her acting was as stiff as a wooden chicken. When singing, her eyes would occasionally look at the front, as if she was not listening to the interrogation. However, she still enjoyed great praise. This means that she had some other power! Performers should not take this as a method. I also attach it to this account.

### Another Divorce Case: Tu Guangqi and Ding Zhi Dissolve Their Engagement

— Bai Ding

How many young men and women seek the freedom of love in order to pursue a happy marriage: However, if love is not happy, it will still create a painful tragedy. This can be exemplified by the divorce of Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua. According to reporters, following Zhou Yan, Tu Guangqi and Ding Zhi have also announced the dissolution of their engagement.

Because Zhou Yan, as well as Tu Guangqi and Ding Zhi, are all artists we are familiar with, the outside world needs to pay more attention.

Regarding Zhou and Yan, the problem is not how to reconcile them, but whether they can guarantee that a second "escape" will not occur after the reconciliation? If so, it would be better to divorce than to force a union, because a forced union only increases pain, while a divorce allows each party to seek happiness in the future. Now Tu and Ding have adopted the latter method, without any disputes. They just feel that since there is no possibility of union between the two parties, it is better to dissolve the engagement!

After the reporter obtained this news, he visited Tu Guangqi and Ding Zhi one after another. I will now describe their conversations below:

National Drama School classmates engaged for six years

Tu: "Ding Zhi and I were both students at the former Nanjing National Drama School. We maintained a good friendship when we were classmates. Later, after graduation, we progressed from the stage of love to engagement. Originally, we could have gotten married immediately, but because we felt that before our careers were successful, getting married would only increase the burden and would not help our work, so it has been six years from engagement to now. Two months ago, we still seemed to be in the throes of love, with no indication of emotional deterioration. Because I was living in her home, and her home has a mother and a brother, under the feudal and stubborn ideas of the two of them, they suddenly became disgusted with me. My personality is that I am unwilling to compromise to any unreasonable oppression, so friction gradually occurred. One day, when I was reading the newspaper, her brother said to me, "Don't order the newspaper, why didn't I read the newspaper that I ordered?" At that time, I understood that he was saying this to me, but I didn't answer. Unexpectedly, his mother also said loudly, "What is this thing doing here?" These words really made me unbearable, so it caused a fierce quarrel. Ding Zhi, because of her emotional relationship, didn't sympathize with me either, so our emotions began to break down. And many of her friends not only did not offer comfort, but instead encouraged her to leave me. Under these circumstances, Ding Zhi suddenly wrote me a letter, stating that the two of us could no longer cooperate, and that it would be best to dissolve the engagement. Of course, I also felt that our restored emotions would deteriorate even more, so I expressed my agreement. Now I have moved out of Ding Zhi's house. Although I am in mental pain, it would be even more painful to get married and then divorce."

Chapter 11: Heroic Demeanor for Fierce Battle

Wang Yongtai and Xu Jing fought to the death without retreating, and were surrounded by the bandits again and again. Xu Jing saw that Wang Yongtai was standing upright, his eyebrows inverted, his robe stained with blood, rushing left and right, full of spirit. He also felt some fatigue, but the bandits on all sides were being killed more and more, and the situation was critical. He was very anxious, wondering how to break out of the encirclement to avoid the annihilation of the entire army. At this time, the sky was already bright, the morning light was faint, half of the torches were still not extinguished, and there were countless bandits in all directions. The bandits saw that they could not catch the two of them, and they refused to give up. A tiger changed horses and came to fight again. Xu Jing could not break out of the encirclement. Suddenly, he saw flags fluttering in the northeast corner of the bandits, and a team of government troops were killing people in the encirclement. On one side, under the ten banners, there was a general with bright armor, riding a white horse and holding a golden spear, who was Zhou Yuji. He got the news of the bandits' attack on the Bo River in the city, and led two thousand elite soldiers to meet him in person. The golden spear was like lightning and a long rainbow, sweeping left and right, and like pear blossoms, dancing up and down. He killed a path and rushed in to meet Wang, Yongtai, Jing and others. When Wang Yongtai saw Zhou Yuji, he shouted, "General Zhou, Yongtai is here." Zhou Yuji also saw Wang Yongtai being entangled by several bandit generals and killed his way into the encirclement to rescue him. Wang Yongtai also rushed towards Zhou Yuji, and Xu Jing followed him to kill his way out. When a tiger saw that the government army had reinforcements, he ordered to shoot arrows. Many crossbow arrows were shot at Wang Yongtai. Wang Yongtai and Xu Jing danced and galloped, and just as they were joining Zhou Yuji, suddenly an arrow flew and hit Wang Yongtai's face. Wang Yongtai shouted, almost fell off his horse, his body lying on the saddle, dragging the snake spear, letting the horse run forward in chaos. Another arrow flew and hit Wang Yongtai's back. Xu Jing was shocked and hurried forward to protect him. He himself was almost hit by an arrow, and his helmet was also shot off. Fortunately, Zhou Yuji's spear picked off a lot of arrows, and Xu Jing followed him to kill his way out of the encirclement, and the bandit's momentum was slightly reduced. Zhou Yuji had to protect Wang and the others and retreat to Daizhou City. (97)

### Marriage Only Once in Life

— Yong

Diana Durbin is enjoying her fame in the American film scene in recent years. She has reached a suitable age for marriage, and has long chosen Paul, who is both handsome and talented. She held a wedding in a chapel in Los Angeles a month ago. More than 500 guests participated, and there were countless people outside the auditorium who only wanted to see the bride's demeanor. When Durbin finished the ceremony, she publicly expressed her personal ideal for this marriage, saying, "My marriage with Paul is my first marriage, but it is also my last marriage in this life." I really hope that Diana Durbin will practice this sentence herself. I also hope that Chinese movie stars can view marriage as Diana Durbin does: "Marriage is only once in life!"

Love Has Been Destroyed, Friendship Is Often Maintained

Ding: "I have nothing to say. (The middle paragraph is similar to what Tu said.) Our breakup was entirely because we felt that there was no longer a possibility of union between the two sides that we decided on this. Although my family has some prejudices, I believe that I will not be influenced by my family's thoughts. What should be said is that his situation from after the war to living in my house in Shanghai, as well as his current attitude, the changes in his life before and after, made me feel dissatisfied. I do not believe that just family misunderstandings would destroy our love. However, although our love has been destroyed, friendship is still often maintained."

Listening carefully to their tone, it can be confirmed that they have agreed to dissolve the engagement. However, after a sudden break in the six-year engagement process, the inside story must be very complicated. The family problems they mentioned are just a cause.

Finally, the reporter feels that two divorce cases have occurred in succession within the same period, and their unions were all based on free love. Then, it is conceivable that love is not happy. In advance, the two parties only relied on emotional impulses, personality will, and status conditions, and none of them considered the criteria. Here, in addition to expressing regret, I sincerely hope that young people will add rational analysis and review when falling in love.
