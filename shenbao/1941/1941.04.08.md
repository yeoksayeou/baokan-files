### Foreign Relations of the South Are Blocked

Sulek: Telecommunications between the southern capital and Switzerland are now cut off. Telephone communications between Rome, Berlin, and Switzerland are now limited to national use. (Reuters, 7th)

London: All transportation between here and Yugoslavia has not yet been restored. Very little news of the war is coming from the southern nations. Due to the lack of information from the southern capital and Germany's efforts to disseminate information, it is difficult to obtain a clear picture of the progress of the German offensive. (Reuters, 7th)

Washington: The State Department announced late last night that the U.S. authorities have not been able to contact the U.S. Embassy in the south. This is probably due to the bombing of the city by German planes, which has completely cut off communication with the outside world. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)

### The Situation in Southeastern Europe Becomes More Serious: Anglo-Greek Forces Bravely Resist; German Official Claims to Have Broken Through the Greek Border; Rumor Has It That Yugoslavia Has Moved Its Capital to Florence

Zurich, Switzerland: After the Nazi war machine shattered the borders of both Yugoslavia and Greece at dawn yesterday, it encountered fierce resistance from the combined forces of Yugoslavia, Greece, and Britain fighting shoulder to shoulder. At present, no direct news can be obtained from the capitals of Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Italy, while Nazi and Fascist radio stations are promoting the Axis powers' news all day long, boasting that after three air raids on the southern capital, it has become a "sea of flames." However, they admit to encountering stubborn resistance, especially from the Greek army in the Struma River valley. It is believed that Hitler has mobilized 500,000 troops for this operation, while the opposing side has 1 million Yugoslav troops and an unspecified number of British and Greek troops. Hitler's strategy is largely similar to that used in the pacification of Poland. German radio stations insist that the Yugoslav government did indeed flee Belgrade before it was bombed. Unconfirmed reports here say that Bulgarian troops are cooperating with German forces in the two strongholds of Thrace and the Struma Valley to fight against Greece. Some people here have heard that Romanian troops may also join the fighting. Croatia (northern Yugoslavia), Zagreb, and Ljubljana have been declared undefended cities. Observers acknowledge that the two cities may fall into German hands, as they are both located on plains with no defenses. Diplomats in Zurich heard that the Yugoslav cabinet moved from the capital to Florence, about 70 miles north of Scutari, while other government officials went to Kak, about 65 miles south of the capital. (United Press, 7th)

London: Ankara Radio in Turkey reported that the German army's target in attacking Yugoslavia is Niš, and the route into Greece is along the Struma River valley. Niš is in eastern Yugoslavia, near the Bulgarian border. The Struma River valley leads from Bulgaria into Greece. The German army is divided into three divisions attacking the Yugoslav capital Belgrade from Romania, two mechanized divisions and one infantry division attacking the southern capital from Szeged in Hungary, and twelve to fourteen divisions operating on the Austro-Yugoslav border attacking Zagreb. This is enough to show that the German troops used are far more numerous than needed to cut the Yugoslav army into two parts. (United Press, 7th)

Ankara: A Turkish military source stated that the German army's first military objective is to gain a foothold between Greece and Yugoslavia in order to maintain contact with the Italian army and to seize control of the "Southern Capital, Niš, Skopje" railway. The same source also stated that the German army has 14 divisions in Bulgaria. They estimate that the strength of the German air force in both Bulgaria and Romania is 1,700 aircraft, including 615 fighters, 75 reconnaissance planes, and the rest bombers. (United Press, 7th)

Vichy: After the German army invaded Yugoslavia this morning, military observers here stated that the German offensive against the southern nation will proceed along the railway between the capitals of Yugoslavia and Hungary, from northeast to southwest. The Yugoslav army is unlikely to resist resolutely, and even the southern capital may not want to defend itself, as its only chance of a decisive battle is to retreat to the Mediterranean coast and join forces with the Greek army. (Havas News Agency, 6th)

London: German radio reported that German forces have crossed the borders of both Serbia and Greece and are making contact with enemy forces everywhere, advancing according to plan, unhindered by treacherous terrain and enemy resistance. (Reuters, 7th)

Berlin: The German High Command stated that German forces have penetrated 18 to 24 miles into Greece and Yugoslavia. (United Press, 7th)

Berlin: According to indirect news from the front, German stormtroopers crossed the river and reached the Yugoslav border at 4:00 AM this morning. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)

Berlin: German officials admitted today that the task facing the German forces attacking the borders of Greece and Yugoslavia is the most serious since the start of the European war. The German side does not hide that the Serbs are the most tenacious fighters in Europe. The mountainous highlands of southern Serbia and northern Greece are best suited for defense, so the German Panzer divisions will have no opportunity for rapid operations. (United Press, 7th)

(Zurich): At 6:55 PM last night, this station received an announcement from the Greek radio station: "The Yugoslav government has announced its withdrawal from the southern capital." Berlin radio also reported that German troops are advancing on all fronts in Greece. (United Press, 7th)

Turkish Capital: News has been received from diplomatic circles here that the morale of the Yugoslav army is very high. (Reuters, 7th)

### Southern Nation Accuses Germany of Aggression; Resolves to Resist Unreasonable Attack; Southern Ambassador Holds Important Talks with Britain

London: Swiss radio broadcast a declaration from the Southern Nation's Embassy in Vichy, stating, "The Southern Nation is determined to defend its independence, territorial integrity, and honor, and to resist this unreasonable attack. Germany is the aggressor. The Southern Nation has not behaved in a way that is hostile to Germany. The real reason for Germany's actions can be seen in Germany's desire to make the Southern Nation abandon its neutrality." The Southern Nation's Ambassador to London, Sopotik, recently told a Reuters reporter, "It is even more shocking that the German authorities have ordered the German army to treat our compatriots with barbaric means. During the last Great War, Serbs and Germans were enemies, but both sides showed mutual respect and abided by the rules of war. It is quite surprising that the German commander-in-chief now deems it necessary to issue this order. In any case, the people of the Southern Nation do not want war, but they also have the courage to accept the challenge. We have a military and historical reputation that is in no way inferior to that of Germany. To say that the Southern Nation is belligerent is to turn the facts upside down, as the Southern Nation did its best to maintain peace in the Balkan Peninsula until the very last moment." The Southern Ambassador visited the British Foreign Office yesterday and held talks with British government representatives for a long time. (Reuters, 7th)

London: Due to the German attack on Yugoslavia and Greece, British military and civilian officials held several emergency meetings yesterday.

(United Press, 7th)

New York: CBS broadcast a special address from the BBC to Yugoslavia today, promising assistance. The address stated, "Germany, without any provocation, has committed barbaric atrocities against Yugoslavia. The heroic resistance of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes places Britain and Yugoslavia on the same front. We welcome the Southern Nation as a determined and powerful allied country, and we are re-establishing our friendship. This friendship enabled us to overcome difficulties and achieve victory in the last Great War. We will fight together until justice is vindicated and law and justice are re-established before peace can be concluded." (United Press, 7th)

Ljubljana: The mayor of this city recently delivered a widespread speech to the city's people, stating, "A curfew will be implemented in this city immediately. It is hoped that all citizens will strictly abide by it. Do not lightly believe alarmist rumors. Our army is fighting on the border and is confident of victory." (Havas, 6th)

### U.S. Air Force in the Philippines Conducts Large-Scale Exercises; Key British and Dutch Figures to Meet in the Philippines

Manila: Twenty-six newly arrived U.S. destroyers exercised here this morning, in the largest U.S. Air Force demonstration in Philippine history. The aircraft squadron performed in the Manila, Camp Keithley, and Fort Stotsenburg triangle area yesterday, as the United States celebrated Armed Forces Day. British Far East Commander-in-Chief Admiral Brooke Popham and Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens will arrive here on the 8th to hold important meetings with U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre. Dutch officials who have arrived here from Batavia to welcome the Dutch Foreign Minister are unwilling to comment on the nature of the future meeting. Sayre also refused to speak, and also refused to reveal the content of his talks with Brooke Popham here last week, saying only that the talks were of a "completely private" nature. He also said that the Dutch, British, and American meeting may last for several days, and said that this Army Memorial Day has great significance, because the United States is now working hard to build its own defense, while also having to assist Britain and other democratic countries to resist the unprecedented barbarous attack that is destroying civilization. Therefore, April 7th will make the people under the American flag have a more profound sense of gratitude for the protection of our army, at a time when this world is full of chaos and conflict.

Editorial

### Prospects for the Balkan War

Over the past few days, the international situation has continuously presented several new forms, which, rather than being regarded as drastic changes, should be regarded as a linear and inevitable development, with no surprises in between. On the same day that Germany and Italy announced their invasion of Yugoslavia, British troops in East Africa defeated the Italian army and entered Addis Ababa, creating the opportunity for Abyssinian King Haile Selassie to return to his homeland and restore his country; within Abyssinia, there are still many remnants of the Italian army, which, if not for their low morale, are still numerous enough to put up a desperate fight, so the East African war has not yet ended, that is, Abyssinia has not yet been cleared; but Italy's attempt to revitalize its military power and turn defeat into victory, at least in East Africa, can be inferred to be hopeless, and the restoration of the Abyssinian king can be inferred to be a certainty of eighteen or nineteen chances out of ten; Haile Selassie's country was destroyed and he fled to Britain and France in 1936; five years later, today, witnessing the decline of the violent powers, it can be said that this day should have come, which is truly exciting, but not unexpected.

The expansion of the European war to the Balkans was inevitable from the start; ever since Italy launched its invasion of Greece and Greece rose up to resist, the Balkans has not only been filled with the smell of gunpowder, but can be said to have been engulfed in flames, so how could the countries of the peninsula remain aloof? Therefore, it is not unexpected that Yugoslavia has finally been drawn into the vortex. What can be regarded as unexpected is that the southern nation is only now involved, and that Bulgaria and Romania, outside of the southern nation, although they have been trampled and lost their freedom, are still clinging to the old and preserving the obsolete, neither seizing the opportunity to roll up their sleeves and rise up to strengthen themselves, nor helping the tyrant to do evil, and exerting their function as claws and teeth; and even more so Turkey, not only is there a question about its treaty obligations, but also, in terms of factual threats, at least since the invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia, it should no longer be able to feign ignorance, but unexpectedly maintains its neutral status to this day. All unexpected things are often determined by common sense and constant principles. According to yesterday's news reports, Turkey sympathizes with Greece and Yugoslavia and implies that the limit of its neutrality is that Bulgaria should not throw stones down the well at Greece and the southern nation; at the same time, it is also reported that Greece has repelled the attacking German army at a certain location and launched a counterattack in Bulgarian territory; after accepting the challenge, Yugoslavia's air force has flown to Romania, which is under German control, and bombed the oil fields; these movements show that the scope of the war in the Balkans is accelerating and continuing to expand, and that the countries that are still standing on the edge of the vortex today will soon be unable to stay in the current stage for long. In short, they will all become members of the great war.

This was originally regarded as unexpected: in the Greek resistance against Italy, although British aid to Greece was public, the British military strength that had infiltrated Greece was still an open secret; until the day before yesterday, when Germany and Italy declared war on Yugoslavia and Germany on Greece at the same time, British troops officially appeared in Greece, and thus there was a three-nation Allied force of Britain, Greece, and Yugoslavia in the Balkans, which is a new posture. From the public joint operations of the three countries of Britain, Greece, and Yugoslavia, new questions were immediately triggered in terms of legal principles and methods, that is, how should Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan be interpreted? At the time of the Italian-Greek war, it could still be attributed to another event outside of the alliance, and Germany and Japan deliberately dodged this question and went their separate ways. Now that Greece and Yugoslavia are openly fighting alongside the enemy countries of the Tripartite Pact, how can it still be explained as being unrelated to the Tripartite Pact? If it cannot be explained as being unrelated, then what will ally Japan do to Yugoslavia, and what will it do to Britain?

Pursuing explanations is not a leisure activity of nitpicking, nor is it the pedantry of an academician; but rather to discern the morality, reason, spirit, and value of the Tripartite Pact, to discern everything related to the Tripartite Pact; and also to discern what achievements the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, who advocated collusion with Germany and Italy and strengthening the alliance, and who had just completed his visit to Germany and Italy and spoke loudly and vehemently, has made in this trip, and how it will affect everything of the alliance. Therefore, we are happy to hear verbal explanations and happy to see factual explanations. By inference, Matsuoka will return empty-handed and will remain silent and not give any direct explanation! To explain, we still have to wait and see how the Balkan war develops and how it comes to an end. If Germany and Italy have remarkable military achievements in the Balkans and gain an overwhelming victory, it will certainly allow the glory and momentum of the Tripartite Pact to rise again. Victory and defeat are common occurrences, who can know in advance; and since the surrender of France, the Western European war situation has stagnated, and the land combat forces of Britain and Germany have not had the opportunity to compete; the German army, which did win repeatedly in the early stages of the war, has not shown its skills for a long time; recently, in Libya, the German army aided the Italian counteroffensive, forcing the Allied forces to abandon Benghazi, but it can only be regarded as a local skirmish in the great war, differing in nature from a direct operation by the main forces: therefore, how the morale and strength of the German side compare to the early stages of the war, and how the British will fare after having experience in confronting the new German tactics, in the battlefields of the Balkan War from now on, should all be left as questions and await factual answers. This battle is related to the prestige of Britain, to the temporary fortunes and misfortunes of Greece and the southern nation, and to Germany and Italy it is different. Because of the nature of the Balkan War, if Germany and Italy are defeated, Nazism and Fascism will be like the setting sun, collapsing at once, and even if the great war cannot end immediately, the final outcome can be said to be decided, so this battle is a decisive battle for Germany and Italy; if the Allied forces of Britain, Greece, and the southern nation are defeated, the fate of Greece and the southern nation will be like France in the past ten months, or even like Abyssinia in the past five years, suffering all kinds of torment and hardship, which is naturally expected, but Britain will never give up from this, and will continue to work hard, with vigor unabated, so for Britain it is not a decisive battle; in other words, the overall war situation, as well as the fate of Britain, Greece, and the southern nation, and even France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and other countries, will not be decided by the Balkan War, that is, the Balkan War has no decisive effect on the democratic countries. However, the victory or defeat will inevitably affect another aspect of the international situation, and Japan is not the only one watching.

### The Fierce Fighting in the Struma River Valley; German and Greek Forces Clash Violently; The German Offensive Against Salonica is Obstructed; 600,000 British Troops Arrive in Greece to Assist in the War

British Supreme Commander in Greece, Wavell

London – With the assistance of British, Australian, and New Zealand troops, the Greek army is fighting valiantly. The German offensive against Salonica has essentially come to a standstill. According to a Greek military spokesman, the German army has repeatedly attacked along the Bulgarian border but has been repelled each time. All the Greek fortifications have put up successful resistance, although one position was lost after a fierce German assault. The Greek army destroyed ten German tanks, and Greek fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns shot down six German planes. In addition, some German troops were captured. A squadron of British Air Force Hurricane fighters shot down five German Messerschmitt Bf 109s, and all the British planes returned safely to base. Today, the Greek side announced that several areas have been evacuated according to plan to avoid unnecessary sacrifice. After some initial progress, the enemy advance has been halted along the entire front. The main route of the German offensive along the Greek-Bulgarian border passes through the Rhodope Mountains, with the key route being the Struma River valley, leading directly to Xanthe, 50 miles northwest of Salonica. Originally, the direct route to Salonica passed through the Vardar River valley in Yugoslavia, but due to Yugoslavia’s resistance, this route is no longer available to the Germans. The German side has openly acknowledged the strength of the Anglo-Greek resistance. The spirit of the Greek people is high, and large numbers are flocking to the General Staff in Athens to volunteer for service. (Reuters, 7th)

Athens – The Greek General Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that strong German forces, with the latest weapons and supported by tanks, heavy artillery, and a large number of aircraft, launched attacks on our army’s positions along the Bulgarian border at dawn yesterday, dividing their forces and launching numerous assaults. The Greek army and air force, outnumbered, fought bravely, and the battle raged throughout the day, especially fiercely in the Struma River valley. Only one position along the entire front was captured. Ten enemy tanks were destroyed by our forces, and five or six enemy planes were shot down. To avoid unnecessary sacrifice, our forces have retreated from certain positions to pre-determined defensive lines. By nightfall, the enemy offensive had been halted. (Havas, 7th)

London – According to the German official news agency, British and German troops have made contact on the Greek-Bulgarian border. The German advance is encountering strong resistance, especially in the Struma River valley. However, the German side is reportedly satisfied with the news received so far. According to an announcement by the Athens radio, the forward units of the Greek army on the eastern front are holding their positions everywhere. According to news from Vichy regarding the Bulgarian border, German planes bombed Salonica yesterday. The German radio’s statement that the German army encountered strong resistance in the Struma River valley should not be interpreted as the German army having deeply penetrated Greek territory, as the Struma River valley is partly in Bulgaria, and the German army would naturally encounter strong resistance when entering Greece from there. German radio broadcasts reports from eyewitnesses describing the difficulties of the German advance along the valley, stating that the Germans must use all their organizational capabilities to overcome the obstacles of the mountains and climate. German soldiers must erect markers along the mountain roads to warn motorized units of dangerous locations. German engineers are now blasting rocks to build roads to facilitate the movement of heavy vehicles. (Reuters, 7th)

Berlin – It has been learned from responsible authorities here that the German advance into the Struma River valley is encountering strong resistance from Greek troops, but military reports indicate that the German advance is still progressing smoothly. The Struma River flows from Bulgaria into Greece at Xanthi, and then into the Aegean Sea east of the Chalkidiki Peninsula. The city of Salonica is located west of the peninsula. (Haitong, 7th)

New York – According to unconfirmed reports from Ankara, the Greek army has counter-attacked and repulsed the German forces, and is fighting in some areas within Bulgarian territory. This news was broadcast by a correspondent for Columbia Broadcasting System in Ankara. (Reuters, 7th)

Athens – A Greek communiqué claims that Greek forces destroyed ten German tanks and shot down six German planes yesterday. All Greek artillery batteries, except for one, resisted heavy bombardment and aerial attacks. Greek forces have abandoned some territory but have halted the enemy on the front lines. (Reuters, 7th)

Athens – Last night, a spokesman for the Greek Ministry of Information stated that it was expected that the Greek army would only be able to resist the German forces for two hours, but unexpectedly, it has resisted for twelve hours and maintained an unbroken front against an enemy ten times stronger. The concentrated German attacks have encountered devastating artillery fire. (Reuters, 7th)

London – The British government announced yesterday that British Empire troops have been stationed in Greece. "The troops sent to Greece include soldiers from Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. The Royal Air Force has greatly strengthened Greek defenses." General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Command, is now the Supreme Commander of British forces in Greece. The decision to send a large British force to Greece was proposed to the War Cabinet by Foreign Secretary Eden and Chief of the Imperial General Staff Dill, and subsequently approved by the Cabinet. However, since that decision was implemented, the situation in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean has changed dramatically, with German mechanized forces suddenly appearing in large numbers in Libya, forcing British forces to withdraw from Benghazi. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has adopted a policy of supporting Yugoslavia, which is a very strong move recently, although the Soviet Union has not indicated that it will provide material assistance to Yugoslavia as it did to China and the former Spanish government. (United Press, 7th)

Istanbul – According to reliable sources here, the number of British troops landing in Greece is approximately 600,000. (Havas, 7th)

London – British newspaper commentators have warned the Allied nations that their initial battles in the Balkans may result in retreats due to the lack of sufficient British troops and supplies. However, they also state that this situation can be quickly remedied. Informed British sources say that the initial deployment of British troops to Greece was mutually agreed upon by the Greek and British General Staffs, but the current British forces in Greece are not yet sufficient to constitute full British assistance. Therefore, newspaper commentators suggest that the initial stages of the war in Yugoslavia may face setbacks but believe that the British troops sent to Greece will not repeat the experience of Norway a year ago. The commentators warn of impending difficulties and believe that Prime Minister Churchill may deliver an early report to Parliament. (United Press, 7th)

### King George's Address to the Nation: Fight Shoulder-to-Shoulder with Yugoslavia; Absolutely Fearless of Hardship and Suffering; With British and American Aid, Victory is Assured; Greek Commander-in-Chief Encourages Subordinates to Devote Themselves to Overcoming the Enemy

Athens – King George of Greece, General Papagos, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and the Greek government each issued statements last night, emphatically declaring their determination to fight until final victory is achieved. General Papagos issued a general order to Greek troops on the front lines, encouraging them to fight with the same dedication as the Greek troops on the Albanian front. The order also earnestly mentions "our armed brothers, the British army," and states, "We are determined to resist and conquer the enemy, just as we have conquered numerous other enemies." King George issued a proclamation to the people regarding the German attack on Greece, stating, "With God's help, we will prevail. The Greek people have proven to the world that they value honor above all else and will resist the new enemy with honor to the end. Although Greece is small, its spirit is great. Now attacked by another country, we will not allow that country to destroy it. Our struggle will be difficult and painful, but we will not be afraid. We will endure hardship and suffering and will not shrink from any sacrifice. Victory awaits us in the future, and then Greece will once again gain lasting glory. Greece now has two powerful allies: the British Empire, with its indomitable spirit, and the United States, with its limitless resources. We will also fight shoulder-to-shoulder with our Yugoslavian brothers, shedding our blood together to save the entire Balkan Peninsula and humanity. With God's help, we will prevail."

The Greek Government Encourages the Nation

The Greek government also issued a proclamation urging the military and civilians to fulfill their duties to the nation in the face of German aggression. The proclamation states, "The German Minister visited the Prime Minister this morning, informing him on behalf of the German government that German troops would attack Greece. At the same time, news was received from the border that the German side had carried out its threats. At dawn on April 6, 1941, the Axis powers repeated the Italian aggression of October 28, 1940. Greece's glorious destiny and sovereignty have been met with this new aggression. The government, therefore, urges all military and civilians to fulfill their duties to their beloved motherland, to exert their strength, courage, and perseverance, to deeply understand the righteousness of their cause, to invoke God's blessings, and to protect our brave and great allies." This proclamation was signed by Prime Minister Koryzis and all members of the government. (Reuters, 7th)

All of Greece is Filled with Patriotic Sentiment

(Athens) According to the latest news from the border, large numbers of Greek troops, determined to defend their country, are moving into newly prepared positions. As they marched to the front lines, they shouted, "Long live our country, long live our King, long live our army, God bless us." The people of Macedonia and Serres, most directly affected, showed great enthusiasm. Yesterday, when King George and Prime Minister Koryzis traveled through the streets of Athens by car, the people cheered enthusiastically. Subsequently, many people held non-violent demonstrations, going to the General Staff to volunteer for service on the front lines. The people of Salonica also marched in formation to the British and Yugoslav consulates, cheering before signing their names. Upon hearing the news of the German attack throughout Greece, the people's shared hatred of the enemy was unprecedentedly fervent. Soon after, patriotic parades were held everywhere, traversing all the streets.

Prayers in Churches to Repel the Enemy

Churches are filled with prayers to repel the second enemy as they repelled the first. And the people everywhere hold great confidence. Upon hearing news of the German invasion, they were extraordinarily calm. Greek troops on the Albanian front, upon receiving the news, also showed great enthusiasm, deeply believing that they would defeat the new enemy, singing the national anthem, and cheering for the King and the country. In military hospitals, wounded soldiers who could get out of bed all left their beds to sing the national anthem. In front of the British military headquarters in Athens, crowds gathered, shouting, "We will win." Youth groups marched in formation, and large crowds stood outside the headquarters, watching important figures enter and exit. Special editions of newspapers were eagerly purchased by the public, all wanting to be the first to see them. (Reuters, 7th)

### Greek Banks Limit Withdrawals

London – A dispatch from Athens by the Independent French News Agency reports that the Greek cabinet met yesterday morning, and Greek banks have limited withdrawals, allowing depositors to withdraw 5% of their deposits each month, up to a limit of 10,000 drachmas. (Reuters, 7th)

### Yugoslav Minister of Public Works, Mr. Gulovic, Dies in the Capital

Swiss Capital – Radio Ljubljana in Yugoslavia recently broadcast a message stating that when German planes bombed the Yugoslav capital city today, Mr. Gulovic, the Minister of Public Works and leader of the Slovenian party, unfortunately died. It was also stated that the Slovenians have organized a Slovenian National Committee to strengthen the unity of all parties and factions in the country to defend the motherland. (Havas, 6th)

### The Soviet Union Fully Sympathizes with Yugoslavia's Position; Because its Measures Conform to the Principles of Peace; The Soviet-Yugoslav Pact is Definitely Not a Formal Document

Moscow – The newspaper "Izvestia" published an article entitled "A Document to Consolidate Peace," stating, "The signing of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia fully conforms to the wishes of the people of both countries. Judging from the past experiences of the Soviet Union, this type of pact is not just a formal document, but can, in fact, consolidate peace. We must realize that this agreement was signed at a time when the war is expanding, a war that has already affected hundreds of millions of people and will continue to involve more lives in a bloody tragedy. This point is especially sufficient to show the importance of the Soviet-Yugoslav agreement. The Soviet Union cannot help but sympathize with the Yugoslav government's efforts to maintain peace and enhance its foreign standing, as all actions aimed at peace conform to the Soviet Union's foreign policy. Now, this common desire for peace has been translated into a diplomatic document. There is no doubt that the Soviet-Yugoslav agreement concluded yesterday will certainly be supported by the people of Yugoslavia, and it will also be approved by the great Soviet people. This important document is a new expression of Stalin's peace policy and conforms to the interests of all countries striving for peace." (TASS, 7th)

Moscow – Regarding the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression pact, "Pravda" commented, "The day of the signing of the Soviet-Yugoslav friendship and non-aggression pact is not only a milestone in the development of friendly relations between the two countries but also shows that the two governments have jointly strived to enhance peace and prevent the expansion of war. In order to adhere to the policy of peace, the Soviet Union has firmly followed Stalinism. The signing of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia fully conforms to the basic principles of the Soviet Union's foreign policy. Recent events in Yugoslavia have fully demonstrated that the people of Yugoslavia are indeed striving for peace and do not want their country to be dragged into war. In meetings and demonstrations, the people of Yugoslavia have made it clear that, in the history of international relations, the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression pact will become a special document of peace and a clear demonstration of the Soviet Union's struggle for peace. The Soviet people will give it their enthusiastic support." (TASS, 7th)

### Britain and America are Excited by the Signing of the Soviet-Yugoslav Pact

London – Responsible circles in London regard the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression pact as an extremely exciting development, and Washington shares this view. According to news received here, Under Secretary of State Welles in Washington told people that he felt particularly interested in this agreement. Many people feel the same way. This agreement has great significance and will definitely excite Greece and Yugoslavia, and it is also quite important for Turkey. (Reuters, 7th)

London – British Home Secretary Morrison commented on Germany's declaration of war on Yugoslavia and Greece last night in Nottingham, saying that he hopes Turkey understands that the time has come to make decisions concerning the safety and security of the entire Balkan region. The Soviet-Yugoslav mutual non-aggression pact is most welcome. Although we should not overemphasize it, if this indicates a shift in Soviet policy, it would be fortunate not only for Europe but also for the Soviet Union. He believes that Hitler will encounter forces he does not want to see in the Balkans. (Reuters, 7th)

Sydney – Australian Foreign Minister Steward stated today that Australia will, in accordance with Churchill's guarantee, assist Yugoslavia and Greece with all its resources to the extent possible.

Australian newspapers have strongly condemned Hitler's recent actions. (Reuters, 7th)

### The U.S. Government Expresses Assistance to Yugoslavia in Resisting Aggression; Supplying its Needs with Various Military Supplies; And Using Seized Danish Ships for Transportation

Washington – Secretary of State Hull, who met with President Roosevelt last night, announced that the U.S. government is proceeding as quickly as possible with the supply of military and other supplies to Yugoslavia. The savage invasion of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers, with the aim of annihilating it by force, is another scene in the Axis powers' plan to conquer the world. Now there is another weak country being invaded by force, showing that the Axis powers' actions to conquer the world are endless and without earthly or other limits. The American people express great sympathy for Yugoslavia, which has been attacked without cause. We are now watching with ardent emotion the courageous struggle of the Yugoslav people to defend their country and protect their freedom. The U.S. government, in accordance with its policy of assisting those who defend themselves and resist aggression, is now transporting military and other supplies to Yugoslavia as quickly as possible within the realm of possibility. Hull has instructed the U.S. mission in the Yugoslav capital to continue operating, but has informed the mission to preferably stay with the Yugoslav government. The news of Germany's declaration of war on Yugoslavia was briefly mentioned in a short cable from the Yugoslav capital received by the New York Times, which stated that at 2:35 a.m., the air raid alarm sounded in the Yugoslav capital, which was the first indication that Yugoslavia had entered a state of war. Shortly after, two Yugoslav fighter planes appeared in the sky over the Yugoslav capital, flying east. A little later, two more planes followed. Radio communications in the Yugoslav capital have now been interrupted. (Reuters, 7th)

Washington – Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary of State Welles reviewed the situation in Yugoslavia yesterday. The Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Fotitch, also met with Welles today. (Havas, 7th)

Washington – Secretary of State Hull, Under Secretary of State Welles, and Assistant Secretary of State Berle worked overtime in their offices all day Sunday. The White House also maintained close contact with foreign affairs intelligence. The Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States had a long conversation with Welles yesterday. Observers are closely watching the British clearing out of Italian forces in East Africa, as the United States has expressed its intention to shorten the war zone and allow ships to sail into that area. However, the shipping routes have not yet been determined. It is said that President Roosevelt has already obtained a blueprint of the items needed by Yugoslavia in recent consultations with the Yugoslav Ambassador. Senator George, a Democratic Senator from Georgia and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Turkey may soon be drawn into the war, and that Germany's invasion this time, disregarding waging war on two fronts simultaneously, is the last measure to maintain Germany's dignity. (United Press, 7th)

Washington – Authoritative sources here revealed last night that the U.S. plans to use the seized Danish ships, valued at $23 million, to accelerate aid to the Balkans. The government is planning to place the Danish ships under legal control so that they can be used by the government as soon as possible. A government official pointed out that these thirty-nine Danish fast ships could transport all the supplies that the United States could provide to the Balkan countries under the Lend-Lease Act to the Balkans. A spokesman for the Danish Embassy said that Denmark would be happy to respond, which is tantamount to urging the U.S. government to requisition the ships immediately. (International News Service, 7th)

Washington – It is understood that a large number of armaments have been shipped from the United States to Yugoslavia, and according to the State Department, assistance will also be provided to Greece in addition to providing supplies to Yugoslavia. According to President Roosevelt's announcement last week, France has a large number of field guns stored in the United States, which will be transported to Greece. At present, there are many Yugoslav ships anchored in American ports, which can quickly transport armaments back to the country. As for the types of armaments, since most of the output of American aircraft factories is shipped to the United Kingdom, it is not possible to supply Yugoslavia with aircraft at this time. Therefore, these armaments will mostly be limited to rifles, machine guns, ammunition, and bombs. (Havas, 7th)

Washington – Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Fotitch, told reporters yesterday that the people of Yugoslavia will resist to the end, no matter what difficulties they encounter, and are deeply grateful for the U.S. government's efforts to help. In addition, the Greek Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Pous, also made similar remarks. (Havas, 7th)

New York – Eleven prominent Americans of German origin jointly sent a telegram to Yugoslav Prime Minister General Simović, congratulating Yugoslavia on its position of striving for independence. The signatories included former German Minister of the Interior Solmann, Dr. Goss, a professor at Princeton University, and the well-known journalist Villard. According to their spokesman, Dr. Belloni, this telegram was actually addressed to the entire people of Yugoslavia. The telegram reads, "Millions of Americans of German origin oppose Hitlerism, uphold freedom, and support the consistent position of the Yugoslav people in striving for independence and resisting Nazi aggression. We are especially excited about the actions of Yugoslavs of German origin in supporting Your Excellency." (Reuters)

### British Troops Capture Addis Ababa: Encounter Minimal Resistance; Italian Empire Nearing Total Collapse; British Vanguard Advances North of Addis Ababa Towards Dessie

Cairo - British troops in Abyssinia are advancing rapidly, like wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The vanguard occupied Addis Ababa last night (established as the capital of Abyssinia in 1696). It is reported that there was no fighting when British troops entered Addis Ababa. South African forces have been pursuing victoriously since crossing the Awash River on Saturday and Sunday, encountering no resistance. A Cairo military spokesman stated today that the capture of Addis Ababa does not mean the complete conquest of Abyssinia, as there are still large Italian forces in the region that have not surrendered. It is believed here and in London that Italian Commander Aosta has received direct orders from Hitler to take action to tie down British forces in Africa as much as possible. The fighting in Eritrea is also coming to an end, as it is reported that Free French patrols have reached within eight miles of Massawa (a key Italian port along the Red Sea). The Queen of Abyssinia, who is currently in London, upon hearing the good news of the British troops reaching Addis Ababa, her private secretary stated, "Abyssinia, the first to suffer the disaster of totalitarian aggression, has now regained its freedom. The Queen is overjoyed and grateful to God and the British Empire." When Addis Ababa was about to fall, it was bombed by British air force and South African aircraft. Public announcements stated that the airfield, hangars, and barracks there were hit by heavy bombs, causing large fires. After the British planes finished bombing, they strafed enemy planes on the ground, destroying four enemy bombers and damaging several others. Enemy fighter planes attempted to intercept British planes but were quickly repelled. Enemy transport vehicles southeast of Addis Ababa were also heavily bombed, suffering severe damage. On the 4th of this month, British planes carried out a night raid on the barracks, storage depots, and power plant in Tripoli, all of which were hit by heavy bombs, causing fires. All British planes returned safely. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)

London - The War Office issued a public announcement today stating, "Before British troops entered Addis Ababa yesterday, the Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, Duke Aosta, sent a letter through an Italian messenger to British Generals Cunningham and Wavell, expressing his gratitude for the two generals' advance steps to protect the women and children of Addis Ababa, and stating that the humanitarian connection between Italy and Britain could be clearly demonstrated here." (Havas dispatch on the 7th)

Cairo - The Italian colonial empire is declining daily. Except for the port of Massawa on the Red Sea, which is now virtually under the control of British, Imperial, and Free French forces, all Italian forces have been driven out in several inland battles. British and Imperial forces have advanced to Addis Ababa within ten weeks with irresistible force. When the Italian forces captured it years ago, it took them five months, and the resistance they faced was from a defenseless people. The Italian forces retreated even before being driven out. The first to arrive in Addis Ababa were South African troops. The waters off the port of Massawa are now full of British warships, monitoring German and Italian ships attempting to escape. The Daily Telegraph's comments seem to sum up everything, saying, "The death knell of Mussolini's empire has sounded. The British side will be able to draw more troops to Africa or Macedonia to fight the Nazis." (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)

Cairo - According to an official announcement, on the evening of April 5, our vanguard reached Addis Ababa. The Governor-General and government agencies had already left. As a result of the surrender documents dropped by our planes on April 1, a special envoy from the Italian Governor-General of East Africa flew to our lines on the 3rd. Our troops presented various conditions to him and promised to guarantee the safety of the civilian population there in case of fighting near Addis Ababa. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)

Cairo - A military spokesman recently stated that the South African troops who occupied Addis Ababa have advanced north to Dessie, leaving only a garrison to defend Addis Ababa. There was no fighting during the occupation of Addis Ababa. The eleven-week offensive has come to an end, and the East African empire that Italy had been building for seventy years has also collapsed. When South African troops entered the city, thick smoke was still rising from the English bombing. The Italian troops led by Duke Aosta have fled north to Gondar and Dessie. It is possible that the Italian army will put up a last stand in Dessie. It is estimated that there are still 40,000 Italians in Abyssinia. South African troops are advancing along the Djibouti Railway into Addis Ababa. Observers believe that there must still be 70,000 Italian troops left in Abyssinia, waiting for the British to eliminate them. South African troops advanced 30 English miles on Saturday when they attacked Addis Ababa in one day and night. King Selassie is personally leading troops to attack the Italian base of Debra Marcos, 100 English miles north of Addis Ababa. South of Addis Ababa, British troops are advancing from Enkel and Javello. The number of Italian prisoners is increasing rapidly. An entire Italian unit was captured in Agota, 25 English miles east of Adua. The Italian army was fleeing towards Dessie and Asseb. Another British army is advancing towards Massawa.

### Tripartite Pact: Not Entirely Reliable; Observations of a Japanese Political Commentator

Tokyo - Prominent Japanese political commentator Muto warned Japan today that the Soviet Union still threatens Japan's rear, and Japan should not overly rely on the Tripartite Pact.

He said, "When the Soviet Union still threatens Japan's rear, we cannot recklessly sing the praises of the Tripartite Pact. We want to strengthen the Tripartite Pact. Only when Japan, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy are united can we destroy Britain." (Associated Press dispatch on the 7th)

### Emergency Report: Beware of Counterfeits! Strange Phenomenon in Suzhou Society; Shops Operate Without Signs; Old Suzhou Customers Need No Explanation; New Customers Please Register at the Reception Desk

(Special Dispatch from Suzhou) The Caizhizhai Confectionery at the entrance of Zhushi Lane in Guanyuan, Suzhou, was founded hundreds of years ago. The sweets and candied fruits sold there are all made according to ancestral secret recipes and personally supervised, and they are famous far and wide, with a good reputation. Initially managed by the eldest brother, he suddenly resigned nine years ago. The brothers of the shop then assessed the value of the goods and determined the capital, which was handed over to the current owner to take over the business. A contract was drawn up, instructing the owner to take over the business rights under the eldest brother's name, without responsibility for profit or loss, and to pay an annual rent of up to 10,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, the eldest brother harbored ulterior motives and evil intentions, and deliberately created the Yuecaifang Confectionery and Tea Shop in the west of Guanyuan in order to compete. The owner believed that the ancestral legacy should be maintained with all efforts and that everyone should work together to avoid damaging the reputation of the ancestors. Therefore, the owner, despite facing such a great challenge, managed to carry on the family business, which he took as a personal comfort. After the national crisis, a branch of Suzhou Caizhizhai was established at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Yu-tsia-tsing in Shanghai. With the ability to provide genuine goods at fair prices and strive for excellence, the business has been growing rapidly. Last year, the eldest brother suddenly changed his mind again, pointing out that in the current special circumstances, prices have soared, and with his mindset of hoarding and speculating, he wanted to re-evaluate the value of the goods that were assessed nine years ago. He did not hesitate to harm his own relatives, distort the facts, and willingly go to court, filing a lawsuit for execution by the court. He also topped "Yue Zhi Fang" with the "Caizhi Zhai" sign. Since our shop was prohibited from using the "Caizhi Zhai" sign, we have continued to operate without a sign. Thanks to the trust of our customers, the volume of business has remained the same or even increased. However, customers from faraway places may not be aware of the inside story. We are grateful for your attention and continued support. Therefore, we are revealing the circumstances in the newspaper and hope that you will register at the reception desk. Note: "Suzhou Caizhi Zhai" is located at No. 2 Zhushi Lane, Guanyuan Street. The Shanghai branch of "Suzhou Caizhi Zhai" is located at No. 7 Rue Yu-tsia-tsing, opposite the Great World. There are no other branches in the country except for this one. The place in Suzhou County that is currently displaying the Caizhi Zhai sign is Yuecaifang in disguise. The real "Suzhou Caizhi Zhai" is temporarily operating without a sign. We hope that all sectors of society will take note.

### European War Ramblings (43): The Inside Story of Germany During the War

The Germans are not starving. Only the wishful thinkers and those who are poorly informed believe that they are already starving. The fact is that after a year and a half of being blockaded, the National Socialist Party is still able to feed the German people. Americans find it difficult to swallow what Germans eat during wartime, but Germans have been content with large quantities of sweet potatoes, cabbage, and bread for half a century, and they are still eating as much sweet potatoes, cabbage, and bread as possible.

The Germans feel a great lack of meat, fat, butter, and fruit. It is now stipulated that each person can get one pound of meat and a quarter of a pound of butter or margarine per week. This amount is much less than what they usually eat, but it seems to be enough to maintain their health. What is difficult is that fruit, which is richest in vitamins, is often lacking. Last winter was very cold in Germany, and the fruit harvest was very small. When I left Berlin in December, the only fruit sold on the market was apples. Only children, the sick, and pregnant women can enjoy this fruit. There was a time when it was rumored that Germany could get oranges from Italy and Spain, but this did not materialize. During the first winter after the start of the war, I did not see a single orange or banana. At present, vitamin pills of inferior quality are issued to soldiers or children. The food eaten by soldiers is much better than that of civilians. Last Christmas, it was not family members who sent food to the soldiers at the Western Front. Instead, hundreds of thousands of soldiers sent packages of butter, cheese, fruit, and coffee, which they had saved from their rations, to their homes. During the First World War, family members often worried about the healthy men on the front lines. In this war, the soldiers on the front lines are worried about their families.

Since the German army occupied Denmark, a small amount of butter and bacon seems to be available in Berlin, although everyone's rations have not increased. But this supply cannot last, because Danish livestock rely on imported fodder, and the Germans cannot obtain this fodder. Even from the point of view of food, the occupied countries have become a burden to the Germans.

After the outbreak of the war, the Germans had no coffee, tea, or chocolate to drink. What they ate was a charred barley that tasted like dishwater. After the Germans concluded secret agreements with commercial firms in Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and South America, a small amount of chocolate was discovered on the market last fall, after escaping the British naval blockade. In addition, the Germans also got a little of this stuff from the estimated area. By Christmas, about every household could buy about a pound of candy. The day before I left Berlin, I witnessed quiet and hopeful Germans patiently lining up in front of a small candy store in the Artlon Hotel, waiting for the distribution of Christmas chocolate candy.

Germans sometimes have to line up in a long line to buy tobacco. Although tobacco is not restricted, tobacco shops have received government orders not to sell more than one pack of cigarettes or two packs of cigars to any customer in a day. Most packs of German cigarettes contain twelve cigarettes, but there are very few that contain the full number, and the quality is also greatly reduced. German-made tobacco with an impure flavor is currently selling a lot. The cigarettes that the Germans smoked during the war were no better than those smoked by the German soldiers I saw in the English Channel last fall. They were smoking "Golden Bar," a British brand that was seized from the French port of Le Havre as war relics.

The supply of fire-starting materials was quite reduced for a time. It was very inconvenient for those who smoked pipe tobacco. Because they could not get good tobacco, they now had to reluctantly smoke the kind of inferior tobacco that would not light. Those who had igniters could not find even a few grams of oil.

Recently, there have been more matches on the market, and a few shops have been secretly supplying fuel oil to customers.

The Germans, feeling nervous during the war, and unable to use all their money to buy food, clothing, or cars, had no choice but to spend their money on what they could buy. As a result, drinking became fashionable for a while. In the days before the German army began invading Poland, Berlin's adults regarded liquor stores as paradise and tried to save grain for use as food or feed. The famous "Pilsner" beer is now completely unrecognizable. In addition, the supply of Germany's famous red wine has also been greatly reduced. Last summer, if you didn't know Luis Artlon, it would be difficult to buy a bottle of red wine in Berlin. Taverns no longer provide peanuts, almonds, olives, or sweet potato chips. Germany has no three kinds of peanuts and other things, so it has also canceled. Only the inexpensive spiral biscuits can still survive.

The exact number of bottles of champagne that the German army got from France is unknown, but it must be at least millions of bottles. Ribbentrop once served as the sales manager of the German Hangel Champagne Company, so he must still be eating and the truck unloading French champagne in front of the residences of other ministers on Detmar Street is endless, so it seems they may no longer be drinking that German-made champagne.

Although the drinking craze in Berlin is strong, prostitution has been greatly affected. Those who used to engage in the life of a goddess have now gone to factories or worked in the fields. Moreover, under the lighting restrictions, everyone cannot see clearly, and the streets are deserted during air raid alarms, so prostitution is quite unfavorable. (To be continued)

### 工董 Election Unlikely to be Held; British, American, and Japanese Candidates Decided; Intense Competition for Two Additional Board Seats; Taxpaying Chinese Residents Watch Future Developments

The election of directors to the Shanghai Municipal Council this year has broken the usual silence since Mr. Fessenden’s important speech at the beginning of the month, which broadly proposed changing the number of directors. Various foreign national groups have begun to become active. German and "other nationality" residents are eager to try to put forward candidates and occupy a seat on the council. Therefore, the situation in all parties is very tense. However, according to the explicit provisions of Article 28 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, the proposal to change the composition of the board to three each for British, American, and Japanese, four for Chinese, one for German, and two for other nationalities must be approved by all treaty nations and the legitimate government of China to be effective. Unexpectedly, yesterday, various foreign national groups nominated candidates for the next board of directors based on the "new ratio". Details are recorded as follows:

This Year's Election May Be Cancelled

The names of the British, American, Japanese, and German candidates for the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council were learned yesterday. From this, it can be known that this year's election of directors is unlikely to be held, and the consuls general of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan will submit a resolution at the special meeting of taxpayers in the Public Concession to increase the number of directors, proposing to appoint sixteen directors, which should be implemented.

British, American, and Japanese Directors All Nominated

According to reliable sources, on the British side, because the British director will give up two seats, only Mr. J. Keswick, Mr. G. W. B. Powell, and Mr. Mitchell will serve as British directors. It was confirmed yesterday (7th) that the American side has nominated Mr. MacDonald (from Whylie & Co.) to fill the additional American director seat. It is said that Mr. MacDonald was nominated at the meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce last Friday. The remaining two American directors are Mr. Myers and Mr. Allman. It was also learned from reliable sources this morning that the Japanese directors will be Mr. Otoichi Okamoto, Mr. Ikusaku Okamoto, and Mr. Yuta Hata, the latter two being current Japanese directors. Mr. Otoichi Okamoto has also served as a Japanese director before.

Intense Competition for Two Additional Seats

It is also reported that the German director seat will be filled by Mr. Kraetzer, a German resident of this city. The two director seats for other nationalities are expected to be filled by one person each from Portugal and Switzerland, but their names have not yet been revealed. It is reported that the competition for the two director seats for other nationalities is fierce. Mr. Wettler of Switzerland, the protagonist of the large copper theft case, was the first to respond, saying he will participate in the election. Subsequently, the Portuguese Consul General, Mr. Mello, stated that he would make every effort to win a seat on the Shanghai Municipal Council for the 6,000 Portuguese residents of Shanghai. The most vocal candidates for Portuguese director are Dr. Tavares, Mr. Loureiro, and Mr. Sousa, who works at Jardine Matheson. Later, the Russian Residents Association also convened a meeting by Chairman Ivanov to participate in this year's election of directors. However, observing the situation, the Portuguese and Swiss residents have a greater chance of success, but Wettler relies on the Japanese, and public opinion strongly opposes him. The Swiss Consul also declared that Wettler's arrest warrant has not been revoked. Mr. Ivanov of the Russian side is the chairman of the White Russian Association after the assassination of former Chairman Meraz.

Mr. Yuan Ludeng's Statement Yesterday

On the Chinese director side, after the free taxpaying Chinese residents nominated the current directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Chen Tingrui, Xi Yushu, and Guo Shun through communication methods to continue their positions, there has been no further development. Later, Yu, Chen, and Guo left Shanghai one after another. The only remaining ones are Yuan Ludeng and Xi Yushu. According to Mr. Yuan speaking to the reporters of the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday, the Taxpaying Chinese Residents Association has not taken any action on the special situation of the next election of directors. It is also impossible to convene a meeting to elect directors to fill the vacancies because only half of the taxpaying Chinese residents are staying in Shanghai. According to the plan set by the three consuls general, the number of Chinese directors is reduced from five to four seats. Currently, there are only two people staying in Shanghai, so there are still two vacancies. All parties are paying close attention to the issue of candidates for these two remaining seats. Because under this difficult situation, the status of the Chinese directors is completely different from that of directors from other countries, so future developments are highly noteworthy.

From a Legal Perspective, There Are Many Criticisms

According to Article 9 of the Land Regulations, the election of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council should be held one week before the annual taxpayers' meeting, and the current directors will serve until the annual taxpayers' meeting when the new directors officially take office. According to this year's special situation, the change in the number of directors must first be approved by the special taxpayers' meeting, and even if it is approved by the various treaty nations, it must finally obtain the consent of the legitimate government of China to be effective and implementable. Therefore, this year's election should logically be held after the special taxpayers' meeting. However, various resident groups have elected candidate directors according to the new ratio without the recommendation being approved by the various treaty nations and the Chinese government. From a legal point of view, this is very inappropriate.

### Strict Martial Law Once Enforced in the Western District of the Concession Yesterday Morning

Yesterday morning at approximately 10:00 AM, various roads in the western Shanghai area adjacent to the Public Concession and the French Concession enforced a period of martial law. Police authorities from both concessions dispatched police officers to temporarily block the entrances and exits of various roads leading from Jing'an Temple along Haig Road to western Shanghai using barbed wire. Only trams and buses were allowed to pass, while pedestrians were prevented from entering and exiting. The "Special Police" of western Shanghai also implemented similar precautions. Traffic was restored after about an hour, but the inspection of pedestrians entering and exiting remained strict. It is understood that this temporary precaution was due to Fu Xiaoan's burial yesterday, fearing that unexpected events might occur.

### German Embassy Screens European War Films

Mr. Koert, the information specialist from the German Embassy in China, hosted a screening of recently arrived newsreels about the European war for the Chinese and foreign press at the German School on Great Western Road at 4:30 PM yesterday. More than forty people from the Chinese and foreign press attended. After a speech by Mr. Koert, the films were screened. The content included scenes of Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria signing the Axis alliance in Vienna, etc. The event ended at 6:30 PM.

### Employees of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications to Regain Freedom Today

According to news obtained by this newspaper this morning, more than a hundred employees of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications who were detained last month have now reached a resolution through multi-party negotiations by financial figures in Shanghai and abroad. It is said that they will be completely free today.

### Negotiations for Renting Ships to Transport Rice Have Begun to Bear Fruit

Coal Briquette Factory Dramatically Raises Price by Seventy Yuan

Since the authorities actively sought to dredge the source of foreign rice, a ship chartering committee has been established to handle ship chartering affairs. The ships chartered will sail between Shanghai and Yangon, so that 15,000 to 20,000 tons of rice can be transported from Yangon to Shanghai every month. The Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from relevant parties yesterday that after the two authorities conducted ship chartering separately, considerable progress has been made. It is said that the rice-transporting ships and transportation costs have been negotiated one after another, and they will soon be available for legitimate rice merchants to load foreign rice. However, the rice transported by the ships must be registered with the authorities when they arrive, otherwise, they will not be able to enjoy the right.

Extra-Trade Rice Orders Should Be Rejected

Rice firms in the city usually place orders for foreign rice through trading firms such as Dafoo and Hoffine. But some speculators outside the trade have also made large orders for foreign rice, storing it in Shanghai in the hopes of profiting when the rice market experiences disturbances. They raise prices, fabricate rumors, and cause chaos. The entire city hopes that foreign firms will reject large orders from people outside the trade.

Coal Prices Have Reached a Critical Juncture

The city's entire fuel problem has reached a most critical juncture. The soaring prices and the chaos have broken records. However, the source of supply has not decreased, and the transportation costs are only about six US dollars per ton. Therefore, large coal chunks and coal powder have been transported to Shanghai, and the stock in coal warehouses has increased. Although the transportation costs have risen slightly, the coal has not yet arrived. The market trading is all for coal transported in one or two months ago.

Price Hiking is Alarming

The highest selling price of flue-cured white coal has broken the 400-yuan mark, and there is a situation where there is money but no goods. Major dealers insist on hoarding goods and refuse to circulate them on the market. It is also heard that some coal dealers are still sucking up coal in the market. Most small coal briquette factories cannot buy coal powder. The prices of firewood and charcoal available for sale vary greatly. A certain large coal briquette factory, in addition to hoarding coal powder, privately invited fellow traders to set the price, which was raised by as much as seventy yuan per per load yesterday. The current price is 296 yuan, plus three yuan for delivery, and 16 yuan per dan (100 catties) at the retail store.

### Hong Kong Government Inspects Luggage and Goods on Ships Traveling Between Shanghai and Hong Kong

Passengers Not Allowed to Leave the Ship After Boarding

Since April 1, the Hong Kong government has strictly enforced the regulations on the inspection of goods and passenger luggage. The scope of the inspection is limited to ocean liners traveling between Shanghai and Hong Kong. Inland river ships are not within the scope of the inspection. After the regulations are implemented, all goods exported from Hong Kong and luggage carried by passengers traveling from Hong Kong to other places must be inspected and approved by designated inspection officers and issued a release certificate before they can be transported to the ship, otherwise, they will not be allowed.

Goods

Goods exported from Hong Kong must go through the designated procedures before they can be shipped on the ship. However, they must be inspected at the wharf in advance, and the weighing bureau must be notified 24 hours in advance so that officials can be sent to the scene to inspect. The goods must be weighed on shore, and the inspector may order the owner to unpack the cargo for inspection. After the inspection, a mark will be written on the outside of the cargo, and an inspection certificate will be issued. The owner must submit the inspection certificate, together with the shipping manifest and customs declaration, to the Import and Export Department, and the person in charge will issue a release certificate before the goods can be shipped on the ship. For goods shipped by ship in Hong Kong, they must be stored in the Kowloon Warehouse, Taikoo Warehouse, Yik Yick Warehouse, and Jardine Warehouse designated in Hong Kong. Agents carrying goods transshipped in Hong Kong must submit a list of the goods they are carrying, together with the original documents of each item, to the Import and Export Department for stamping. Goods stored in the Kowloon Warehouse and Taikoo Warehouse can be inspected by British tax officials stationed in each warehouse. For goods stored in Yik Yick Warehouse and Jardine Warehouse, officials must be sent by the Import and Export Department for inspection. After all the goods have been inspected and a permit obtained, the warehouse must be responsible for sending the goods to the ship.

Luggage

Passengers leaving Hong Kong on ships from Kowloon Warehouse or Taikoo Warehouse must send their large luggage to the luggage inspection office of each warehouse in advance for inspection. If the passenger entrusts a travel agency to transport the luggage, they must hand over the keys of the suitcase to the person transporting the luggage so that they can be opened when the inspector orders it. If there is no key, the inspector may open the suitcase by any means to carry out the inspection work. If passengers rely on ships in Hong Kong wharves or anchored at sea, their large luggage must be sent to the Queen's Pier in Central at the specified time, and an inspector will be responsible for inspecting the luggage at the pier. As for small carry-on luggage, passengers can carry it on board and be inspected on the ship. Ships carrying export immigrants must be anchored in the export immigrant anchorage area. Passengers are allowed to board the ship within the time specified in advance by the Import and Export Department and the Shipping Administration Department. Other people, except hotel staff who have a pass from the shipping company and wear armbands, are not allowed to board the ship. If the ship is allowed not to sail to the export immigrant anchorage area, passengers are allowed to board the ship only after the loading of goods is completed. Passengers are not allowed to leave the ship after boarding. Before departure, each ship must report its scheduled departure time.

### Labor Strikes in Various Industries

Recently, due to the high cost of living and the insistence on rice prices, workers in various industries have made demands on employers to improve treatment. Many have been resolved, while others are still under mediation. Workers in several industries have also made demands. Details are as follows:

Disputes over Allocation for Garment Workers

According to the Datong News Agency reporter's investigation, the planned strike by garment workers resulted in an increase in garment prices by more than 50%. For example, the original prices for cheongsams were four yuan for single-layer, five yuan for interlining, and six yuan for cotton. The prices for men's long gowns were the same. Now the prices for cheongsams have increased to six yuan for single-layer, seven yuan for interlining, and eight yuan for cotton. The prices for men's long gowns are seven yuan for single-layer, eight yuan for interlining, and nine yuan for cotton. After the increase in garment wages, the labor unrest could have been eliminated. However, due to the problem of profit distribution between labor and management, the garment shops usually deduct 10% of each garment worker's income, and the shop owner and the shop foreman split the amount equally. This rule is maintained as before. The shop foreman should pay the shop owner 50 cents for each day's meal money. Now the shop owner has proposed increasing it to one yuan per day due to soaring rice prices. The shop foreman has only agreed to increase by 50% of the amount of the wage increase, which is 75 cents. The shop owner has not agreed, so labor and management have disagreements. Yesterday, most of the garment workers participated in the strike, and the unrest has a tendency to expand. As for the workers who participated in destroying the garment shops in Maiyu Lane in the French Concession the day before yesterday, 13 people have been arrested and detained in the police station, awaiting investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law for the crimes of disturbing order and damage.

Moving Companies Labor and Management Disagree; Ningbo, Youning, Yongan, Shangtian and other four moving companies, a total of drivers, to capital requested an increase in cost of living subsidies of 100 percent on the fifth day ago in the morning of each company, a total of hundreds of dozens of drivers were on strike at a rate According to Datong News Agency reporters in the afternoon two leasing authorities sent representatives to each of the companies for mediation in the matter, after all, because of wide differences in views, it could not be set up that the strike is feared to be difficult to resolve for a time, heard yesterday that the company's handyman workers also have a strike in addition to the French Concession Ma Lang Road China Car Row days ago, the driver, Liu Ming You, was suspended and that has caused labor disputes

### News of the Sale of the American Club Again; Price Offered of Over 2.2 Million Legal Tender; Rumored to Be Purchased by Shanghai Securities Company

According to the Continental News, Shanghai Securities Company offered 2,225,000 yuan in legal tender to purchase the American Club. The Club held a special meeting on February 28 to nominate a special committee to discuss the matter. It has recently been learned from reliable sources that the committee has recommended to all members of the Club to accept the transaction, stating that although Club fees have increased, maintenance costs have also risen, and it will be difficult for the Club to balance income and expenditure next year.

Lower Floors Still Leased for Club Use

It is said that when Shanghai Securities Company proposed to purchase the American Club, it agreed to lease the lower three floors of the building to the American Club for a period of two years, with an option to extend for another two years. Shanghai Securities Company also agreed that the front door of the building would be used exclusively by the Club, while the upper floors would be converted into office space, and a separate entrance would be opened in the alley. According to members of the American Club, they are quite confused about the buyer, Shanghai Securities Company, because the name of the company is not found in the business directory. It is also heard that several other parties also wanted to purchase the Club, but after consideration by the special committee, they have all been rejected because Shanghai Securities Company offered the highest price.

Scheduled Meeting to Discuss Sale

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, members of the American Club will meet at 5:30 PM on the 10th of this month to consider the recommendation of the Club's special committee to sell the Club to Shanghai Securities Company. It is said that the company has agreed to lease the lower floors of the building to the American Club after purchasing the Club, with a monthly rent of 3% of the selling price of 2,225,000 yuan, which is 5,625 yuan. The American Club will bear three-sevenths of the water and electricity costs, and the remainder will be paid by the buyer. The furniture and equipment in the Club will still belong to the Club. If the American Club accepts the sale, after paying off its debts, there will be a surplus of one million yuan. The special committee proposes to convert this surplus into US dollars and keep it as a reserve fund for use in emergencies.

### Belgian Consulate to Respond to the Arrest of Aiko; Protest May Be Lodged for Unauthorized Entry into the Belgian Emigrant Office; Lawyer Plumer Has Requested a Meeting

Aiko, the leader of the Free Persons Movement in Shanghai, has been arrested for allegedly conspiring with French Navy personnel to escape. He is currently being detained on the French gunboat *Chanier*. It is said that his lawyer, Plumer, formally applied to the French Navy authorities yesterday (7th) for permission to meet with Aiko.

Belgian Authorities to Respond

Belgian authorities may protest to the French Consulate within a day or two, objecting to the French soldiers' unauthorized entry into the Belgian Emigrant Office, a Belgian-owned property, to arrest Aiko without a warrant. The Belgian Consulate remained silent yesterday morning regarding the type of protest to be lodged, only stating that the Belgian authorities in Shanghai are currently investigating the matter and will take "appropriate steps" after the investigation is completed.

Defense Attorney Unable to Meet

Lawyer Plumer stated yesterday morning that he hoped to see Aiko to defend him. A French Navy officer told him that he would not be allowed to meet with Aiko until the investigation currently being conducted by the French Navy authorities is completed. The investigation may take another week to complete. After the middle of the month, Aiko will be interrogated.

French Residents in the City Very Dissatisfied

According to news this morning, the French residents in the city are superficially calm about the French Navy authorities' arrest of Aiko, but they are actually quite indignant in their hearts. If the French authorities had considered Aiko's usual behavior, they should have taken less severe measures, which would not have caused resentment.

200 Soldiers Stationed on the Chanier

The American Columbia Broadcasting Company is willing to provide radio broadcasting equipment so that the Shanghai Tagore group can broadcast a five-minute message to the people of China today or tomorrow. It is said that there are 200 Annamite soldiers stationed on the French gunboat *Chanier*, where Aiko is being detained, to prevent the ship's sailors from rebelling. The Free Persons Movement here has taken precautions to prevent the French authorities from continuing to arrest other prominent free persons. It is said that the special police of the French Concession have gone on strike in protest of the French authorities' arrest of Aiko.

### A Visit to Free China: The Life of Hemingway; An Introduction to the Contemporary American War Writer

— Zi Zhen

Hemingway, a contemporary American war writer, is currently observing in the front and rear of our country, collecting material for his new book. His life and style are introduced below:

Hemingway is an eccentric in modern American literature. All of his works are based on reality and have the touching power of the great English poet Byron. His works are like a flame, often emitting a strange and passionate magic. His style is very rough, often making people suspect that he is a barbarian, but in reality, he is a good man.

He was born in Oak Park, Illinois in 1898. His father was a doctor and had six children, of whom he was the second. From an early age, he followed his father to learn shooting and fishing, and hunted in northern Michigan. At the age of fifteen, he once left his family, but soon returned home and continued to study at the local high school. After graduating, he served as a low-level reporter for the Kansas City Star. In a few months, the United States entered World War I, and he was sent to the Italian front, first as a nurse, then assigned to the infantry, and later wounded in action. After World War I ended, the Greco-Turkish War broke out, and he served as a war correspondent for an American newspaper, entering and leaving the line of fire, and experienced many risks. Later, when he went to Paris as a correspondent for the *Toronto Star*, he was only twenty-two years old, but he was already world-weary.

At this time, he began writing in Paris. His debut work, *Up in Michigan*, was published in 1921. His style is simple and unadorned, without any affectation. He likes to use ordinary words to express sincere emotions. Readers see the works of other writers as if they are taking a horse-drawn carriage to see flowers, appreciating them casually, but when they read his works, they cannot help but feel shock and terror, and their emotions are boiling.

Hemingway's first successful work was the short story collection *In Our Time*, published in 1925, depicting stories of war and bullfighting. Two years later, *The Sun Also Rises* was published, depicting the story of a group of outcasts. By 1929, the love novel *A Farewell to Arms*, based on World War I, was published, and he became famous in one fell swoop.

After that, he published *Death in the Afternoon*, *Green Hills of Africa*, *To Have and Have Not*, and other works. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1937, Hemingway went to Madrid as a war correspondent, which was a major turning point in his thinking. He then completed *The Fifth Column*, *The Spanish Earth*, and the novel *For Whom the Bell Tolls*. (To be continued) Hemingway and his wife

### Extortion of Cheng Yuxin Tea Shop: Fierce Bandit Refuses Arrest and Struggles, Specifically Sends Letter Demanding Extortion of 20,000 US Dollars, One Bandit Shot and Captured at Designated Meeting Place

Yesterday at 4 PM, a case of police and bandits fighting occurred on Route Zikawei, Shanghai West. On the spot, one bandit was shot in the back and captured. The case is complex and intricate. Here are the details gathered by our newspaper reporters:

Details of a Threatening Letter and a Bullet

Cheng Yuxin Tea Shop in this city is a large enterprise, with four branches. The day before yesterday at 4 PM, a man in a Western suit delivered a letter to the Cheng Yuxin No. 1 branch at No. 7 Guixing Lane, Guangdong Road, Public Concession. He handed the letter to the counter. The shop assistant, seeing the shop's name on the envelope, immediately opened it and was shocked to find a threatening letter addressed to the owner, Cheng Shisheng, and the manager, Cheng Zuoquan. Enclosed in the letter were two pistol bullets, with the names "Shisheng" and "Zuoquan" engraved on them. It demanded a huge sum of 20,000 US dollars. The letter also stated that a representative wearing a blue cloth long gown, holding two tins of "Three Castles" cigarettes and a newspaper as a sign, must be sent to the entrance of Yuyuan Lane on Route Zikawei at 4 PM on the 7th for negotiation. After reading the letter, the shop assistants were terrified. The man then opened his Western suit outside the counter, revealing a hand grenade hanging in front of his chest, and said that if they did not come tomorrow, he would treat them with this, and then left, his whereabouts unknown.

A Great Fight Ensues: Bandit Shot and Captured

The shop assistants presented the letter to Cheng Shisheng and Cheng Zuoquan. Cheng and others, seeing the fierceness of the bandits, reported the information to the Zhabei Police Station. The Zhabei Police Station sent detective Guo Ruiquan to handle the case. Guo went to Shanghai West to meet with "Special Police Unit" "Detective Team Leader" Chen Zhongfang, "Deputy Team Leader" Liu Jinsheng, Yin Zhanqing, and others. Around 4 PM yesterday, they disguised themselves and waited near the entrance of Yuyuan Lane for the bandits. The disguised negotiator acted according to the plan, loitering there for a while. A car sped over, and a bandit inside, seeing the disguised negotiator, jumped out of the car, grabbed the negotiator's hand, and threatened him with a pistol, attempting to force him into the car. At this time, the detectives saw the situation and rushed forward to arrest him. Unexpectedly, the bandit had also seen through them and fired his gun first. The detectives returned fire, and gunshots rang out, causing pedestrians to scatter. In the end, both sides fired dozens of shots. The bandit fled to the intersection of Jiasfei Road and Jinjia Lane before being shot in the back and falling to the ground, captured.

Bandit Rented Car: Confesses Name as Ding Xuewen

Earlier, at 3:42 PM yesterday, a bandit went to the Tailai Automobile Company branch on Yuyuan Road, saying that he needed to rent a car to transport a guest. The branch sent driver Wang Changgen to drive car number 12119. After the passenger got into the car, he instructed Wang to drive to the entrance of Yuyuan Lane. When the car reached the Zikawei Road 404 Western Children's School, the man saw the disguised negotiator wandering back and forth, so he asked Wang to stop temporarily. Wang stopped the car. When the passenger opened fire on the detectives, Wang realized he was a robber. At that time, stray bullets were flying, but fortunately, no passersby were injured. Traffic in the surrounding area was temporarily suspended. It was later learned that the bandit who was shot and captured had been taken away by the Zhabei Police Station and confessed his name as Ding Xuewen, 31 years old. The case is still under investigation.

### Confiscated Arms Case: Continued Investigation

Police Remain Extremely Silent: Surprising Developments Expected

The Shanghai Times reported that police sources claimed yesterday (6th) that after Zhabei Police Station detectives confiscated a large number of weapons last Friday and arrested 18 Chinese, no one else had been arrested, nor had any more weapons been confiscated. Therefore, there has been no further development in the matter. Those who have been arrested have not admitted to participating in:

Armed Crime

It is not yet known whether the Public Concession Police Department's firearms experts have found any clues in the confiscated weapons to prove that the arrested persons participated in any armed crimes.

Judging from the current situation, however, there will soon be a "surprising" discovery. The police are extremely silent about this arrest and are unwilling to disclose any information. It is generally expected that those arrested will confess to participating in kidnappings, robberies, and assassinations for political reasons.

### Altered Horse Race Ticket to Claim Prize: Exposed on the Spot

Accused of Fraud and Forgery

Last Saturday afternoon, after the eighth final race of the Shanghai Race Club, horse number 14 won the prize, and each ticket was worth 50 yuan and 6 jiao. Unexpectedly, a Shandong man named Zhang Quanlin, only 19 years old, picked up several horse tickets with the number 11 inside the racecourse, used ink to change the Arabic numerals on the tickets to 14, and took them to the prize redemption office. The first time, in a hurry, Zhang managed to redeem 50 yuan and 6 jiao. The second time he went to redeem, the clerk Ye Zikang noticed that the ticket had been altered, so he called police officers number 1245 to take Zhang to the Chengdu Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court No. 2 of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him for fraud and forgery. After Judge Zhong questioned him, he ordered him to be detained for another hearing on the 6th.

### American Soldier Kills Infant: Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; His Wife Almost Faints Upon Hearing the Verdict

Last month, he murdered the young child (only 15 months old) of his wife, Hailun, and her ex-husband, and abandoned the body on the playground of a Jewish school. He was arrested after the incident. The American court has held several hearings on this case. Today (7th), the hearing continued. Presiding Judge Hellmick announced that it had been proven that the defendant committed the crime of murdering the infant. He then asked Keithsmann if he had anything to say. Keithsmann replied in the negative. The presiding judge then sentenced him to life imprisonment. Keithsmann seemed quite calm when he appeared in court today, and he showed no sign of panic after the verdict. His wife, Hailun, was quite uneasy when she came to court, and she sobbed softly. She seemed to faint upon hearing the verdict and immediately left the court. According to the court lawyer Hill, Keithsmann can appeal within three months if he does not accept the verdict. He can be released on parole after five years in a penitentiary. It is believed that the US Fourth Army authorities will report to Washington and then discharge Keithsmann.

### Theft of Handgun Results in Probationary Sentence: Released and Commits Another Theft; Gambles Without Remorse, Steals to Live: Dozens of Pawn Tickets Seized, Investigation and Handling

Zhao Anda, a 20-year-old Nanjing native who previously worked as a translator for the Jiaxing Road Police Station and lived at No. 3, Lane 103, Guling Road, stole a handgun from a Western police officer at the Jiaxing Road Police Station last winter, intending to use the money to gamble. He was arrested by the Zhabei Police Station and sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The court sentenced Zhao to eight months in prison with probation. However, after Zhao was released,

He Did Not Repent

He went in and out of gambling dens every day and pawned all the valuables in his home. Recently, he stole more than ten pieces of clothing worth more than 500 yuan from his second landlord, Yuan Jinchun. Yuan reported the theft to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest Zhao and seized 47 pawn tickets and six pieces of clothing. Yesterday morning, they were jointly escorted to the Criminal Court No. 2 of the First Special Court and prosecuted for theft. They also requested an extension to investigate whether there were other cases involved. Judge Zhong presided over the trial and questioned him.

The Defendant Confessed

My father, Zhao Qingkui, is currently working as a detective in the police station. After I was arrested for stealing a gun, my father stopped providing for my family. Later, after your court sentenced me to imprisonment with probation, my father did not help me find a job. I had no choice but to live off my savings. The day before yesterday, when we had no money at home, I asked my wife to beg my father, but she was scolded and sent back. I was

Forced to Act Out of Desperation

I thought, taking advantage of the landlord's sound sleep at night, I used a hemp rope to tie it to the iron railing on the drying platform, then pulled the rope down with both hands, broke into the landlord's bedroom, and stole several pieces of clothing. This was also due to economic pressure. I ask the court to be lenient. The court reviewed the situation and ordered him to be returned to custody, with the hearing postponed to the 16th of this month.

### Male Corpse Found in Vacant Lot on Route Hoche:

Hacked to Death in a Horrific State: Wearing Western Suit, Name Unknown

At 2:30 AM yesterday morning, a male corpse was suddenly discovered on the vacant lot at the intersection of Route Hoche and Route Lanthune in the French Concession, hacked to death. The body was first discovered by Chinese police officers No. 503 and No. 1072 of the French Police Department. The two officers were patrolling the nearby area when they suddenly heard a dog barking urgently on the vacant lot. Suspecting there were thieves, they went to investigate and discovered the body. The corpse was a man in his twenties, wearing a light grey torn Western suit, a black overcoat, and had a green handkerchief in his pocket, stained with blood. Inside the Western suit was a diary, and a pair of green short socks, unworn. The death was extremely horrible. Both ears had been chopped off, there was a knife wound on the right arm, and the most gruesome was a knife wound on the head, starting from the top of the right head, cutting off half of the head. The eyes were also chopped off. The body faced south with feet pointing north, but the right foot was missing a shoe and sock, while the left foot was wearing a black leather shoe. In addition, an empty medicine bottle and two tufts of hair were found near the body. The case is currently under investigation by the police.

### Postal Workers Advance Limit

Regarding the request of postal employees in this city for a salary increase, the Postal Administration has approved each person to advance 100 yuan, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to reporters from the Pingming News Agency, the Administration replied in a telegram that each person can advance half of their monthly salary before the 10th of this month, and those with less than 50 yuan will be increased to 50 yuan. The amount is to be repaid by the end of May.

### Caizhi Zhai Trademark Lawsuit

Caizhi Zhai Confectionery on Guanzian Street, Suzhou, near the entrance of Sensi Lane, was founded by a Mr. Jin from Zhejiang during the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong era. The confectionery and candied fruits produced are famous and far-reaching. Several years ago, a "Suzhou Caizhi Zhai Branch" was opened across from the Shanghai Great World, and business was thriving. Recently, due to discord between brothers, the eldest brother, Jin Yian, wanted to take the Caizhi Zhai trademark as his own, suing the court for sham execution, and the real "Suzhou Caizhi Zhai" does not use the trademark and operates as usual.

### Weather Report

The Zikawei Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather here and along the Chinese coast would be clear and cold, with local morning fog and northwest to northeast winds.

### Finance: European Situation Increasingly Urgent; Selling Spree of Foreign Exchange Ignites Again

The foreign exchange market yesterday: HSBC's listed prices did not change. The black market for British and American exchange rates saw intense fluctuations. Due to Germany declaring war on Greece and other countries, the international situation is deteriorating. Furthermore, rumors of a loan agreement between China and the United States have emerged, and the price of gold has fallen below 6,500 yuan. Therefore, with speculators dumping 500,000 US dollars, the price of the US dollar once dropped to 5.375 yuan. The British pound could be settled at 3 shillings and 25 pence. However, after 9:30, HSBC and American banks began to absorb the supply, easing the pressure, and the US dollar returned to 5.34375 yuan as the bank's buying price. At noon, the pressure increased again. In the afternoon, news of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan emerged, as well as rumors of a southern advance by the Japanese military. It was rumored that the war in southern China was unfavorable, and speculators were aggressively selling. The US dollar for this month could be settled at 5.375 yuan, and the British pound at 3 shillings and 26.5625 pence. Ultimately, the stability was restored due to buying by Japanese commercial banks. The closing price was 3 shillings and 25 pence for the British pound and 5.375 yuan for the US dollar, with the British pound up 0.015625 to 0.03125 and the US dollar up 0.03125 to 0.0625. Trading throughout the day was extremely heavy.

Speculative Shorts Increase Bets

The banks opened the spot selling prices in the morning, with the British pound at 3 shillings and 23.4375 pence and the US dollar at 5.3125 yuan, showing no significant change from Saturday. After the opening, due to negative news from abroad, speculative shorts increased their bets, and the market became slightly stronger. Some May US dollars were sold at 5.34375 yuan.

Around 10:15, due to the settlement of oil bills, the number of sellers decreased, and the market stabilized. Some spot US dollars were absorbed by foreign banks at 5.3125 yuan. However, the British pound remained at 3 shillings and 25 pence because no one was interested in it. At noon, speculators resumed selling, and the market weakened again. Some US dollars for this month were sold to a certain bank at 5.34375 yuan. The market closed with the British pound at 3 shillings and 25 pence and the US dollar at 5.34375 yuan.

Both Spot and Futures British and American Exchange Rates Rise

### Outbreak of Balkan War: Gold Price Drops Significantly; Already Enters 500 Yuan Level

Yesterday, the black market for gold saw a sudden sharp drop in price, falling below the 6,500 yuan level. Everyone was nervous. Shanghai West speculators had over 2,000 taels in short positions, but amidst the negative rumors, the price continued to fall lower. Reports claimed Germany had declared war on Greece, and there were rumors of a loan agreement between China and the US. In the afternoon, there were even rumors of a Southern Chinese defeat, and a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan. Nervous individuals saw this as a sign of an aggressive Japanese advance into Southern China. Although three gold shops vigorously bought in the morning, slightly raising the price to 6,515 yuan, it soon fell below 6,500 yuan. In the last half hour of the afternoon, the rumors intensified. Gold shops, silver shops, and securities firms all sold, causing the price to plummet to a closing price of 6,455 yuan, down 82 yuan. The total trading volume was 25,600 taels. Cash transactions were rare, and most cash shops were watching from the sidelines. Fei Wenyuan sold 20 taels to Fang Jiuxia at a price 170 yuan higher than the futures price, and another 10 taels to Chida at a price 180 yuan higher. In the afternoon, there were sellers at 170 yuan higher, but no transactions were seen. The price was over 90 yuan lower than last Saturday. Jewelry gold dropped by 10 yuan to 680 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.

Black Market Drops 82 Yuan

Since the price of foreign exchange fell in the morning and international tensions worsened, the market was soft. The opening price at 9:15 was 27 yuan lower, at 6,510 yuan. The public panicked, and Chengyi and Xianghe vigorously bought, so it retreated to 6,500 yuan, then rose to 6,505 yuan. Dafengyi, Dade Fu, Gonghe, and Hengji came to sell, as did Chengyi. Furthermore, US dollars for this month were available at 5.34375 yuan, making the market very weak. The price then dropped 42 yuan to 6,470 yuan. Tongkang, Yongxin, Fengyong, and Dechengmi absorbed the supply, stopping the decline and rebounding. Dafeng and Xinyuan also bought, and there were rumors that Shanghai West speculators were buying. Foreign exchange also stopped falling, and the price rose by more than 40 yuan, reaching 6,513 yuan. Tianyuan, Gonghe, and Deda came to sell again, causing the price to fall again at noon. The closing price at noon was 6,490 yuan. The market opened at 6,490 yuan at 2:00 PM and then stabilized for a long time. Silver shops sold, causing the price to retreat from 6,493 yuan to 6,483 yuan. Dafeng and Chengyi bought, raising it to 6,498 yuan. Unexpectedly, rumors of negative news suddenly arose at 3:20, and Tianyuan, Tongkang, Yongcheng, and Yongli vigorously sold.

### Foreign Currencies Mostly Retreat

Yesterday, the prices of foreign currencies in the black market trended downwards. British and American gold pounds also fell by 2 yuan each. The British gold note remained unchanged, and the market price was flat. The American gold note trended downwards, retreating to 18 yuan and 2 jiao and 9 fen in the evening, down 2 jiao and 6 fen from last Saturday. The supply of Hong Kong notes was also strong, and the market price fell. The Japanese gold note fell sharply, reaching 1 yuan and 9 jiao and 3 fen in the evening. There was also little demand for Korean notes, which retreated to 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 1 fen in the evening.

### Dried Goods: Hainan Dried Longan Rises Another 10 Yuan

Hainan dried longan continues to rise as the supply is limited and domestic sales are strong. It opened at a higher price of 10 yuan, but was still not willing to sell in large quantities. The market is expected to continue tightening.

### Grains: Stockpilers Emerge Mid-Course: Rice Prices Rebound and Then Stabilize

The rice market, which was closed for the Qingming Festival and the weekly holiday for two days, resumed normal operations yesterday. At the opening of the early market, the foreign rice market was strong, as local shops eagerly sought to replenish their supplies, and demand felt strong. Those who had been floating the market, seeing the active sales, successively came out to absorb supplies. The situation was unusually vigorous at the time. Vendors took the opportunity to raise prices, and all prices rose, rising about one yuan each. No. 1 Saigon opened at 110 yuan, No. 2 at 107 yuan and 5 jiao, 107 yuan, Gao Baishen Xiaojiao at 107 yuan and 5 jiao, 107 yuan, Zhongguan at 106 yuan, and Suijian at 87 yuan. However, after this brief flurry, the hearts of the people could not help but ease, as large shipments continued to arrive at the port. Actual sales immediately turned sluggish again, and at the same time, those who had been floating the market also came out to sell one after another. Brokers even dumped large quantities of spot goods, creating a situation where there was more supply than demand. The rising trend was immediately frustrated, and all prices gradually fell back to the original levels at the close of the market. Statistics show that after the rise and fall, it reached a stable level compared to the week before, without much change. No. 1 Saigon remained at 109 yuan, No. 2 at 1067 yuan, No. 1 Siam at 1089 yuan, Huojiao Gao from 108 yuan, Jue at 106 yuan, Baishen Xiaojiao at 106 yuan and 5 jiao, 106 yuan, Zhongguan at 105 yuan and 5 jiao, 105 yuan, Tokyo Suijian at 978 yuan, Cuijian from 867 yuan, Jue to 812 yuan.

The source of foreign rice, Dahe also arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou wheel, loaded with 8,353 bags of foreign rice and 927 sentences of corn from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 5th of the previous day and docked at the company's pier in Pudong to unload. The Shun'an wheel arrived at the port on the same day, also loaded with 7,622 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Jinan wheel arrived in Shanghai on Sunday (6th), loaded with 15,983 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's pier in the French Concession to unload.

The arrival of Guo rice, such as thick and thin Japonica, is still not strong, and in terms of sales, general shops are still not willing to buy because the door-to-door sales are not extensive. Therefore, although those who want to raise prices, it is difficult to get their wish, and the result can only be that there is no change. Changbang Hujian Tebai Geng is 1078 yuan, Gao 116 yuan, Qingte Geng 110 yuan, Kunshan Hujian Bai Geng 1145 yuan, Dashibai 1112 yuan, and the next to 109 yuan. Qing Hao Hujian Bo Dao is 109 yuan and 108 yuan and 5 jiao.

The way for glutinous rice is also not extensive. Except for the fact that cake shops and rice shops sell a little, wholesale transactions have all stopped. However, the market is not abundant, and the market is worthy of standing firm, without rising or falling. Hong Kong Te Yuan still opens at 1045 yuan, Jue to 100 yuan, Nuocha Gao from 967 yuan, the next to 93 yuan.

### Active Sales: Flour Market Turns Stable

Burmese Flour: The flour market yesterday, at the opening in the morning, the buying was intense, because after the holiday, actual sales gradually moved, and it was heard that the North and South customers had been buying at low prices, and the Taishang residents were also gradually active. Zhonglou Huaniao brand noodles opened at 28 yuan and 23 jiao, and Jinlong brand noodles opened at 28 yuan. Then, because customers and residents bought, the price secretly tightened. Before the evening market, those who held the goods were even more guarded, and the market prospects may have the hope of development, because after being tired for many days, the price has been low, which has attracted the attention of speculators inside and outside the industry.

Wheat: Yesterday's market situation was still plain and unremarkable, because although the arrival of goods was rare these days, each flour factory's purchasing was very sluggish. Gao Du wheat was 456 yuan, lacking a considerable recipient, but those who held the goods insisted on not selling at a low price, so the situation was still brewing.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Speculation Resumes: Results in a Sharp Increase of Five or Six Yuan

The soybean oil market had been brewing for a long time under the competition between bulls and bears. Yesterday, there was a sudden wave, rumors spread, speculative desires were strong, bulls were strong, and prices rose. At the highest peak, it soared by six or seven yuan compared to before the holiday. Although there was a suppression by bears in the middle, but it was a drop in the bucket, and it did not help. The result was still a sharp increase of five or six yuan. It is estimated that 20 pieces of Yantai oil were traded, the price was 100 yuan, 300 dan of Dayou Factory oil, the price was 103 yuan and 5 jiao to 07 yuan, 100 barrels of Dalian oil, the price was 143 yuan and 5 jiao to 147 yuan, and then 146 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen. 300 barrels were ordered to be delivered in April, the price was 143 yuan to 146 yuan and 7 jiao Niu, and over 1,000 barrels were ordered to be delivered in April, the price was 144 yuan and 5 jiao to 49 yuan and 5 jiao, and then 48 yuan.

Yesterday, 1,260 bags of soybeans came from Qingdao.

Today (8th), 530 bags of soybeans are transported to Xiamen, and another 840 bags are transported to Zhoushan, and another 250 bags are transported to Luzon. In addition, 375 bags of sesame seeds are transported to Hong Kong.

### Yarn Flowers: Actual Sales Not Very Developed; "Double Horse" Yarn is Carried Up by Miscellaneous Brands

The yarn market shows a slight upward trend, as confidence has turned firmer. At the same time, miscellaneous yarn brands are in tight supply. 20-count "Angel," "Double Globe," "Special Gold City" yarns are all trending upward, with the price gap between them and "Double Horse" yarn narrowing daily. Therefore, market sentiment has hardened somewhat. However, actual transactions have not been very active. Coupled with the tense situation in the Balkans, short sellers still exert heavy pressure. Nevertheless, many parties are discussing that while white goods are rising, cotton yarn is declining. They have not given up on absorbing chips. Securities firms have returned to buy, mostly scooping up available supply. Certain short sellers have also covered significantly. Under these circumstances, there might be some recovery. The high price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn is 1,400 yuan, and the low price is 1,391 yuan. In the early afternoon, it initially traded at 1,399 yuan to 1,400 yuan, then fell to 1,394 yuan following the gold price decline. The final price was 1,395-6 yuan. Today, five bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 100 bales to Hong Kong, 620 bales to Siam, and 150 bales to Little Luzon.

The "Double Horse" yarn market opened flat this morning. The initial price was 1,392 yuan, slightly declining to 91 yuan. At this time, buyers were eager, and securities firms dragged in a large quantity, causing the price to rise to 1,400 yuan in an instant. Although market sentiment was tense, it failed to break through 400 yuan. However, as the margin call price fell, sellers became slightly active, and the price dropped to 1,392.5 yuan. Nevertheless, the chips on the trading floor were not very abundant. Some say that the tense situation in the Balkans, while not lowering market prices, offers potential upside. At the same time, miscellaneous yarn prices rose, and buyers rushed back, causing the price to gradually rise to 1,398 yuan at closing. A check of the intraday transaction statistics shows 5,280 bales traded. The amounts bought by various firms are listed below:

Hong Kong: 150; Mainland: 25
Xiamen: 5; Peers: 5,100

Total: 5,280

### Cotton Mills' Appetite Gradually Opens; Peer Trading Also Still Lively

The current cotton situation remains good. Prices for 42-count and 32-count raw materials are rising daily. This is because fine yarn prices are exceptionally high, and mills are making substantial profits. Therefore, they are eagerly acquiring these raw materials, and market sentiment is uniformly bullish. As for 10-count raw materials, they are also being carried up, although the increase is relatively moderate. However, inter-dealer trading is extremely active. The willingness of Chinese mills to operate is gradually improving. Yesterday, manufacturers and peers traded a total of 2,035 bales, with prices increasing by 1-2 yuan. The current cotton market prices are listed below:

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Remain Weak as Before

Public bonds: The unofficial market situation remained unable to rally yesterday. Although many parties have a strong appetite to buy, they prefer to obtain cheap prices. Therefore, when sellers are eager, they take advantage of low prices to buy, without raising prices. The market price of Class A bonds is the lowest because the redemption period has expired, and they are being sold to repay debts. There is no other factor. Currently, the price difference between Class A and Class C bonds is only 8 yuan and 5 jiao, making it the cheapest of the five types of bonds. Such a good price may not be easily obtained in the future because Yuxing is selling off inventory to realize cash as the redemption period expires. Even the bullish positions in Class A bonds of Renfeng and Fengfeng cannot be maintained. Trading volume was not high yesterday. Xinfu continued to buy in the morning, and the amount was not small. Juxin, Yitai, Xinfeng, and Yichang also bought. Market prices initially rose and then fell. Class A bonds opened at 8 jiao and fell to 3 jiao, causing other types of bonds to also decline slightly. In the afternoon, only Class C bonds were relatively stable. Xinfu continued to buy, and Shunchang also had strong buying interest. Renchang and Delong also had substantial appetite. However, Yuxing, Renfeng, and Hefeng sold, especially Class A bonds. As a result, Class C bonds did not fluctuate, while Class A bonds fell by as much as 6 jiao. Other Class B, D, and E bonds also declined by 2-3 jiao accordingly. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.67 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of China Bank stock were traded at a price of 13 yuan, equivalent to 65% of face value.

### Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory Issues Dividends

Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory, one of the three major pharmaceutical factories in this city, recently resolved at a joint meeting of directors to issue a dividend of 1 fen for the 29th year, starting from April 16th, it is said.

### Coal: Alarming; Coal Balls Rise by 70 Yuan

The coal ball market rose sharply again yesterday due to the surge in maritime shipping costs. Prices from peer manufacturers and factories suddenly increased by 70 yuan, from 200 sixteen yuan per ton for train cars. Retail prices at local street stores were 16 yuan per load. Prices have increased by two installments in ten days, reaching 110 yuan, which is truly alarming. Although there are elaborate explanations, it is difficult to dismiss suspicions of manipulation.

### Piece Goods: Large Purchases from Guangdong and Hong Kong; Cotton Cloth Experiences Another Round of Price Increases

Factory Cloth: The market situation was vigorous yesterday due to large purchases from Guangdong and Hong Kong, which stimulated market sentiment. Peers and hoarders seized the opportunity to hoard, causing the quiet cloth market to experience another round of price increases. Sales prices for various cloths opened slightly higher in the morning and then continued to rise step by step. As a result, white goods and coarse cloth increased by 5 jiao per piece, while fine cloth and twill increased by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece. Colored cloth, serge, and woolen fabrics increased by about 1 yuan. Bleached cloth and light-colored fabrics experienced a smaller increase due to seasonal limitations in customer sales. The current market for finished products is stronger than that for gray cloth. Yihua Factory issued over 1,000 bales of coarse cloth for April-May delivery. Chinese factories issued a few hundred bales of fine cloth and twill for April delivery, mostly absorbed by peers and dyeing factories. Guangdong and Hong Kong buyers purchased over 500 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Zhejiang and Fujian buyers purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. Local street transactions for various cloths were nearly 10 pieces.

### Zhejiang Province Promotes Mobile Schools; Number of Schools Increased from 60 to 100; Rising Prices Cause Increases in Recurring Expenses

Lishui Correspondence: Zhejiang Province has established mobile schools and implemented mobile teaching to adapt to extraordinary times. At the same time, it examines the following situations: (1) scattered villages, inconvenient transportation, making it difficult to concentrate children; (2) impoverished areas, sparse population, unable to establish complete schools; (3) many children out of school due to the impact of war, with no schools to enter; (4) children unable to attend school full-day or half-day due to transportation and living conditions. Based on the above four situations, 40 schools were initially established in 16 counties close to the war zone in Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Yuyao, and counties with inconvenient transportation in Wuyi, Lishui, and Jinyun in April of the 27th year. They adopted a one-year or two-year short-term primary school teaching method, divided into: (1) long-term gathering, setting up a class in each suitable location, with an enrollment of about 15 people, with teachers teaching full-day or rotating in the morning and afternoon; (2) temporary gathering, with no enrollment limit, with teachers temporarily gathering and teaching, ending after a certain period of time and continuing or changing locations to teach. After this trial, there were many successes. In September of the same year, 20 provincial-run mobile schools were established in 10 counties close to western Zhejiang and the war zone, such as Xindeng, Lin'an, Yuqian, Fenshui, and Tonglu, so that local children out of school could all be admitted free of charge and school supplies were provided. The number of mobile schools also increased from 60 to 100. As many as possible, those who were familiar with the situation in the war zone in various counties in western Zhejiang were selected to serve as principals and teachers of mobile schools. Before selection, they underwent rigorous examinations and training, which was a further step compared to the first and second decisions to examine or select unemployed teachers in the war zone. Regarding the funding for mobile schools, it was 2,800 yuan in the 26th year, 6,540 yuan in the 27th year, and 48,480 yuan in the 28th year. When each school was established in April of the 27th year, each school was given an establishment fee of 10 yuan, a preparation fee of 10 yuan, a monthly salary of 14 yuan for the principal and teacher, an office expense of 6 yuan, and a travel expense of 2 yuan, with a monthly recurring expense of 22 yuan. A travel expense of 2 yuan was added to schools in the war zone, for a total of 24 yuan. In the autumn of the 28th year, prices rose sharply, and living and office expenses were slightly increased. Therefore, the recurring expenses of each school were increased to 36 yuan for schools in the war zone and 30 yuan for schools not in the war zone.

In the Hualaidun International Badminton Finals, China versus Portugal, held yesterday afternoon at the Xieqiao General Assembly Gymnasium, there were also a Maiga performance, as well as the men's singles and women's doubles finals before the match. In the opening Maiga performance, the French Chamber of Commerce faced the Xieqiao Assembly, resulting in a 1-1 tie. Following this, in the men's singles, Hong Dequan faced Yang Jingling to compete for the Shanghai championship. Hong is the runner-up from the previous tournament. His skills are already superb, and his strength is naturally above Yang. However, due to nervousness at the start, he was down 2-8. Hong held his composure and forced it to 7-9, and then he was smooth sailing, finally winning the first game 15-9. In the second game, Yang was already showing signs of fatigue, while Hong fought more and more bravely, seemingly effortlessly, finally winning again 14-4, thus defeating Yang Jingling 2-0 to win the championship. It is commendable that both the champion and runner-up of this year's competition were Chinese players. In the women's doubles final, the international doubles final was the finale. The Chinese representatives were Hong Dequan and Hou Shuji, while the Portuguese team was Xiannaxueer Foye. Hong is known for his bold and decisive style, while Hou is known for his steady and quick playing. They complement each other perfectly, so as soon as they made contact, it became a one-sided affair. As a result, the Portuguese team was crushed 15-4, 15-5, and China defended its championship.

### How to Prepare for Daily Lessons (1)

— Lu Shaoji

1.  The Heaviness of Daily Homework

Today's young students have a lot of homework, and one person's energy is limited. Without proper guidance, it is difficult to achieve excellent results. In which period is the guidance of young students' studies most important? There is no doubt that it is in the "middle school period" because the daily homework of today's middle school students is too heavy. For junior high school students, there are 15 subjects, including civics, Chinese, English, mathematics, natural history, physiology and hygiene, chemistry, physics, history, geography, manual labor, drawing, music, physical education, and scouts. For senior high school students, there are also 15 subjects, including civics, Chinese, foreign languages, mathematics, biology, minerals, chemistry, physics, history, geography, manual labor, drawing, music, physical education, and military training. Among these many subjects, except for the art and sports subjects, subjects such as Chinese, English, mathematics, nature, and society all need to be prepared for. Moreover, the three subjects of Chinese, English, and mathematics require a lot of preparation time due to the difficulty of learning. Furthermore, the daily homework of middle school students is the foundation for future research in various advanced fields of study. If daily homework can be guided to clarify the path of research, then their studies will be "orderly and without confusion." Therefore, what is said in this article is focused on middle school students. There are few writings in China's cultural circles on the guidance of young people's studies, but the American educator G. M. Whipple has written "How to Study Effectively," and the American educator A. W. Kornhaucer has also written "How to Study," which describes the study methods in detail. Based on the suggestions of the two authors and the author's own opinions, the conditions and methods for young students to prepare for daily homework will be discussed separately.

2.  Conditions for Preparing Homework

Young students want to achieve excellent results in preparing for daily homework and must have the following conditions:

(1) Maintain Physical Health: The efficiency of young people's thinking is related to the efficiency of the central nervous system. If there is a lack of proper exercise, adequate sleep, easily digestible food, or fresh air, the efficiency of the central nervous system will be reduced. In addition, physical defects that hinder nerve activity, such as eye diseases, ear diseases, dental diseases, nasal polyps, and nasal congestion, should not be neglected. Seek medical treatment early.

(2) Constantly Arouse Motives: According to Kornhauser's opinion, "Adiwing Motive" is the main condition for young people to study effectively and is the key to young people's studies. Because if a young person can have this strong desire to control homework, he will be interested in intellectual things and determined in school work. Even if a person's work was very bad in the past, if he now has this motivation, he will be able to change his past lazy and indifferent attitude and strive for enthusiastic and strong efforts, making his future hopeful.

(3) The Working Environment Must Meet the Needs: The environmental conditions during work, such as light, temperature, humidity, clothing, tables, and chairs, must meet the needs. First, try to find a quiet room to prepare homework to avoid various disturbances caused by the eyes and ears. Second, pay attention to whether the light, temperature, and humidity of that room are suitable. The light must never shine directly on the eyes, and reflections from the book surface should be avoided. The temperature should be most suitable at 65 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Too high or too low will cause various uneasy phenomena. The air must circulate, but there should be no drafts. As for tight clothing, it should not be worn because it hinders physical development and blood circulation. Furthermore, the height of tables and chairs must be suitable for individual needs because too low a table can easily lead to shoulder droop, chest shrinkage, and head swelling. Too high a table is uncomfortable for the arms and can easily lead to nearsightedness. Therefore, the height of tables and chairs must be carefully chosen by individuals.

(4) Application Tools Must Be Fully Equipped: "If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools." The same is true for young people's studies. When preparing homework, the tools must be complete, such as pencils, erasers, fountain pens, blotting paper, rulers, knives, pens, ink, paper, dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc., must be listed on the desk to make it convenient to "get them with one reach" when in use.

The above-mentioned four conditions—physical, mental, material, and mechanical—are truly indispensable conditions for young people's studies today. (To be continued)

### Family, My Home

— Furan

We five brothers have been living together for five years. Except for me, a bachelor living in the living room of a public place, the rest have wives and children. The way they distribute rooms is based on the order of seniority. For example, the eldest brother, relying on the innate privilege of being born early, naturally occupies the best wing room. That is on the second floor, in the main room, facing south and sitting north, warm in winter and cool in summer. There is also a small platform outside, which is truly the most quintessential place in the entire building. The second brother and the eldest brother are twins, but because they landed two hours apart, he was assigned to live in the main room on the third floor. That room is comparable to the eldest brother's room, except for the lack of that narrow platform. Because of this little dissatisfaction, it aroused all kinds of jealousy from the second brother towards the eldest brother. The third brother's position is even worse. They live in the pavilion rooms on the second and third floors respectively. It is extremely hot in summer and extremely cold in winter. In extremely cold and extremely hot times, it is especially easy to feel the unfairness of the room allocation. As long as there is a spark, it is a family dispute.

When there is a dispute at home, the second, third, and fourth brothers always stand on one side because of the same interests, forming a united front. The eldest brother was scolded anxiously by them, so he used his father's orders to resist their attacks, saying: The allocation of housing and the granting of the power to manage family affairs were entirely from the father's orders and were not obtained by his own request. Indeed, the father's thinking is too old. Five generations living under one roof is the old man's lifelong dream. It was the old man who allocated the housing like this when he left Shanghai, and at the same time gave all the power to manage the family to the eldest brother. The eldest brother holds great power, inevitably domineering some, and the younger brothers are unwilling to give in, so naturally, there will be trouble for no reason, making a mountain out of a molehill.

There are really many children in our family, big and small, a total of ten or so. They, like their fathers, are unwilling to do anything, and spend their days idle, specializing in the skills of flying eaves and walking walls, and drilling holes to eavesdrop. Whenever something happens at home, no matter how secret it is, they cannot escape their ears. They sell the news they have gathered to each other's parents in exchange for more or less rewards. Because there are these benefits, so at dawn, they run up and down the buildings in groups, very busy as if something important is happening. The architecture of our house is not very strong. After a burst of pounding on the stairs, a lot of dust will immediately fall from the ceiling. Especially at mealtime, many cheap MSG are added to the dishes out of thin air, which makes it impossible to eat!

The sisters-in-law are also really good at enjoying themselves. Every day, in addition to eating, drinking, and having fun, they only think about how to use means and how to provoke disputes. As for teaching husbands and children and managing family affairs, it is not within their daily curriculum. Take the eldest sister-in-law, for example. Before dawn, she always eats a bowl of jujube porridge. This porridge is made by simmering jujubes and rice over low heat overnight. It is said that it is very nourishing to eat often. I have no such experience and don't know what the effect is. After eating the porridge, she still lies down to sleep and is unwilling to get up until after noon. Her work in the afternoon is arranged to go to mahjong. But no matter where she plays mahjong, no matter how far the journey is, the bird's nest at half-past four must not be suspended once. At that time, there will always be a nanny who sends the bird's nest that the eldest brother has personally picked to her to eat. If the time it is sent is a little late, and at the same time it happens that her gambling luck is not good, then the eldest brother will be unable to sleep that night because of her. The second sister-in-law is from Suzhou. She has a very good vocal cord. When she speaks, the soft words of Wu are very pleasant to hear. But when she scolds people, she loses this art. She often opens her throat and shouts loudly, and she will not give up until the other party surrenders. She also has a very bad habit of eating irregularly every day. When she doesn't like to eat, she doesn't care if she doesn't eat for a meal: when she is hungry, she can't wait to put chicken, duck, fish, meat, peanuts, dried squid, and the like all into her stomach. Because of irregular eating, she has a very severe stomach disease. The pharmacy near our house is a regular customer of hers. The third sister-in-law used to be a veteran smoker, but now she has "reformed." She is extremely afraid of the heat, and summer is her miserable day. At dawn, she gets up. Sitting in a chair, she mutters and doesn't know what scriptures she is reciting. Behind her, as usual, there is a little maid who beats her back, and each beat must be uniform in speed and moderate in force. If it is a little too heavy, there will be a slap on the little maid's face, and she will be rewarded with a slipper sole, so painfully that she dare not shed tears. The fourth sister-in-law is the youngest, greedy for sleep and fond of alcohol. Every day, she sleeps for a full sixteen hours, and the rest of the time is spent between glasses of wine. When she drinks at night, her husband and children always surround her, reporting to her about what happened at home that day. She drinks wine while thinking about how to deal with it. She is an extremely scheming person, and sometimes the plans she comes up with make people admire her to the point of prostrating themselves!

I really hate this corrupt and decadent home. I hope that one day bombs can explode in nearby squares, so that these drunken and dreamlike people will have a day to wake up.

### Fearsome Death Ray

— Jin Chun

Austrian scientist Nikola Tesla, now 84 years old, invented electrical machinery early in his career. He settled in the United States in 1884 and continued his research in electricity, inventing various electric machines.

Recently, Tesla, to repay the friendship of the United States, is working on creating a new electrical machine. He calls this new invention the "Teleforce," a kind of death ray. When the machine is activated, any aircraft within 250 miles in the high altitude, when touched by the electricity, will be immediately destroyed into a solution.

This news was released by Tesla's close friend, W. L. Laurence. Laurence is the science editor of the New York Times, so his words should not be entirely groundless. According to him, this death ray machine includes four new inventions: (1) it can emit this light ray without a vacuum, even in ordinary air; (2) it can emit an extremely strong electric power; (3) it can amplify this electric power; (4) it can generate a very powerful propulsion electricity by a new method. Two of these inventions have already been successfully tested.

Tesla plans to contribute his new invention to the U.S. government, but he has two conditions: the government must raise two million U.S. dollars to set up a "Teleforce" factory (which he says can be built within three months); and everything must be handled entirely by him. If this plan succeeds, the United States will essentially add an unbreakable Great Wall to its national defense. Therefore, Laurence believes that even if the hope of success is slim, it is worth trying.

"You probably think very little of his book, right?"

"Oh...!" Xiangqi's question diverted his attention from the piece of paper. "Indeed... this... this is the result of Yuan Shaowen's constant encouragement over the years. Alas!...". Speaking of this, a short sigh involuntarily escaped him. "Therefore, this matter of ours is indeed somewhat unfair to him."

"However, he himself originally opposed his uncle!" Xiangqi said very simply, "Although I dare not say he can definitely forgive us, this matter has only a few indirect connections to him, how can you say it's unfair?"

"Because I've always been too cautious in doing things, now that I'm slightly less cautious, I feel much more timid in my heart." Qiuhaitang slowly put the pencil back into the pencil holder, with a very embarrassed expression on his face.

Xiangqi was sitting sideways on the edge of the bed, half her body leaning against the bed railing, hugging her knees, looking up, her eyes fixed on the rows of bricks, silently thinking for two or three minutes.

"What's the use of being timid?" She didn't look at Qiuhaitang, just speaking to herself, "The way we are sneaking around, there's no way to talk about being cautious. We could be exposed at any time. At that time, not only will you have to smooth things over with Yuan Shaowen, but how can we face ourselves?"

Qiuhaitang lowered his head, almost frightened by her words.

"Now your father can't negotiate with him."

"That's not the way to put it!" Xiangqi's gaze finally shifted from the bricks above to him. "Methods aren't fixed. Anyway, you don't have any family ties. It's easy for us to leave."

"Where can we go?" He thought that no matter where he went, people would always point and comment on him on the street, as if his name was stuck on his face, so he couldn't help but wonder where he could go where no one would know.

"Of course, we can't go to big places like Tianjin or Beijing, and I don't like such bustling places at all. Apart from going further south, any nearby village will do. Don't you have a hometown?"

### Secrets of Spies

— Tingjun

Under Nazi rule, the German government conducted a large-scale anti-espionage campaign, trying to make all Germans vigilantly guard against spies. When movies were shown in cinemas, a warning picture was always shown first, telling everyone to be careful, even with their closest friends, showing a face with a huge index finger placed on the lips, telling people: "Don't make a sound."

It is estimated that European powers spend more than 50 million U.S. dollars annually on espionage work.

Richebourg, the so-called "baby spy," was born around 1758. His body remained as small as when he was born, only two feet tall. This deformed body became invaluable during the French Revolution, because he served as a spy in the army. He often disguised himself as a baby, carried in someone's arms, carrying military secrets, entering and leaving enemy lines.

During the last world war, spies from various countries transmitted various intelligence to their respective armies. The most common information was about the weather.

During the last world war, spies had a very clever way of carrying information, which was to use a pipe, write the information on layers of thin paper, and put it in the wall of the pipe. The spy kept smoking the pipe, and in case of emergency, he lightly twisted the pipe, and the information would be burned along with the tobacco.

In June 1915, a German spy was shot in England. For three months after his death, the German intelligence agency continued to receive "information" from the deceased. Although it was signed by the spy, it was actually sent by a British officer impersonating him. The German intelligence agency was greatly deceived and swindled out of a lot of money.

Nature

### Life on Venus

— Ye Han

Venus is 70 million miles from the sun and is the closest planet to our Earth. Recently, according to astronomer H.S. Jones, life on Venus may be just beginning to develop, similar to the situation on Earth millions of years ago, when the first primitive organisms emerged from the slime of the sea.

Although the surface of Venus is covered by thick clouds, astronomers have used spectroscopes to study it and learned that there is no water vapor on Venus. Jones believes that this may be because the atmosphere above the clouds is extremely dry. There is no free oxygen on Venus, but there is more carbon dioxide than on our Earth.

When life began on Earth, there was probably also a lot of carbon dioxide on the ground, and oxygen was relatively scarce. So it seems that Venus now resembles the situation on Earth millions of years ago. However, even if there is life on Venus now, it is only primitive plants. Life may be developing, and after millions of years, when life on Earth has disappeared, life on Venus may be reaching its most advanced stage.

Mars may have had extremely advanced life before, but now there will definitely be no life on it. Because there is no oxygen or carbon dioxide on Mars now. Therefore, Jones said that under such circumstances, it is questionable whether animals can survive. The situation on Mars and Venus is exactly the opposite. Mars now resembles the state of the Earth millions of years later, when all life on Earth has disappeared and most of the gases on the surface have vanished.

### The Mystery of Ginger Rogers, Star of "Kitty Foyle"

— Huilin

Recently, two things about Ginger Rogers have been causing the people of Hollywood to stare wide-eyed: first, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in "Kitty Foyle" in 1940; like James Stewart's award, the prognosticators were somewhat disappointed because no one had ever guessed that they would win; second, Ginger is still not married, although she is divorced from Lew Ayres, and Ginger's marriage problem is being hotly discussed in the film city.

Now let's talk about her mysterious romance.

Ginger officially divorced Lew Ayres in March last year, but in fact, the two had already separated. The real reason for the divorce is unknown. General speculation is that Ginger was disappointed with Lew Ayres' obscurity on the screen. Fearing that it would affect Ginger's own future, she was unwilling to live with such an unknown person.

Ginger often hangs out with boyfriends like Howard Hughes, Cary Grant, James Stewart, Lee Bowman, and Bena Nyman, and sometimes even goes in and out with Robert Taylor, who has not yet married Barbara Stanwyck. Thus, Ginger became a great source of material for gossip reporters, but she always said it was just for fun and that she hadn't found the ideal man yet.

Then someone said they saw Ginger standing in the corner of a banquet talking quietly with Lew Ayres, and Ginger got into Ayres' car and they drove away together; news reporters believed that Ginger was still in love with Lew. But their official legal divorce last year shattered all the rumors. News reporters asked Ginger outside the court who she planned to marry, and she said indifferently, "We'll talk about it in a year."

But the whole of Hollywood has been waiting for her for a year. Ginger has no good news, and no one can figure out which male star is her official lover. On the contrary, Ginger has devoted herself to the film business and changed her style. Last year's "Primrose Path" was the beginning of her new style, which was very popular among American women. This year's "Kitty Foyle" established her position on the silver screen.

Rogers' position is now the same as Bette Davis, Garbo, and Norma Shearer, and she should also have the airs of a big star, that is, everything is shrouded in a mysterious color. Even her company doesn't know her travel dates and destinations, and she doesn't talk much, unwilling to have much contact with outsiders.

Ginger Rogers came to Hollywood at the age of twenty-two. She has a strong desire for advancement and a competitive nature, and she wants to do everything very well. Each new film must be better than the previous one. At the age of fifteen, she dropped out of school and participated in local entertainment performances. Her mother also sponsored her to sign with a touring group and perform in big cities.

Ginger finally collaborated with Fred Astaire on many musical films: "The Gay Divorcee", "Flying Down to Rio", "The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle", "Shall We Dance", "Top Hat", etc., more than twenty films. Therefore, they are known as the King and Queen of Dance, but they officially broke up the year before last.

Ginger is a very cute woman who makes film city news reporters scratch their heads. Her love life is mysterious, and her acting skills are also mysterious.

According to the most accurate and reliable news in Hollywood film magazines, her relationship with Howard Hughes is still good, because Hughes gave her a ring that Ginger still wears on her finger. From this point of view, she and Lew Ayres cannot reconcile.

You dedicate your entire life to struggle, and at the same time, you stretch your entire life as long as possible. When you should protect yourself, you must protect yourself in order to continue the struggle. Confucius said, "You, if you cannot die a natural death," which means being too fond of bravery and sacrificing your life.

Fifth Chapter Red Skirts Envy Pomegranate Flowers

Li Xin was a military officer, but he had never been on the battlefield in his life. At this moment, he plucked up his courage to meet the enemy. He saw the bandits rushing towards him like a whirlwind. Sitting on the lead red-maned horse was a young woman, wearing a peach-red coat, a peach-red battle skirt, and three-inch red embroidered shoes, stepping on the stirrups, slender and petite. Her head was wrapped in a red turban, her face was painted with red rouge, and she held double knives in her hands, with large red silk balls tied to the handles of the knives. Looking at her, everything was red, like a scarlet pomegranate flower, or like the Red Boy of Flaming Mountain. When he looked closely at her face, he almost cried out in surprise. It turned out that this female bandit was none other than the street performer Tong Tianfeng, whom he had met before. He couldn't help but be startled in his heart. When Tong Tianfeng saw Li Xin, she stopped her warhorse, her face full of smiles, and said to Li Xin with a smile, "What a coincidence! Young Master Li, do you recognize me? I am the Red Maiden of Green Stone Mountain. I have come here specifically to find you. If you are willing to come back with me, I will order my subordinates to stop attacking the city and protect the lives of the people in the city." When Li Xin heard her words, fearing that the Magistrate of Qi County would see something suspicious on the city wall, he pointed the broken silver spear in his hand at the Red Maiden and said, "Hey! Who recognizes you, you female thief? Don't spout nonsense. I will capture you and parade your head!" When the Red Maiden saw that Li Xin was unfeeling towards her, she also sneered and said, "Li Xin, do you think you are a member of a noble family and look down on us outlaws? Hmph! Today, your mistress is going to be impolite to you." With that, she waved the double knives in her hand and chopped down on Li Xin's head. Li Xin blocked the double knives with the broken silver spear, and retaliated with a spear, using the Silver Dragon Dividing Water, aiming at the Red Maiden's chest. The Red Maiden swept the left-hand knife downwards, and with a "clang," she had already blocked the spear. Li Xin retracted the spear and thrust the spear horizontally towards the Red Maiden's horse. The Red Maiden tilted the horse to avoid the spear, and also rolled the double knives towards Li Xin's chest. The two of them each displayed their skills and fought on the battlefield. Li Xin was most skilled in spearmanship in his life. He learned the Yang Family Spear, so although the Red Maiden was brave, she couldn't break through him in a hurry. Feeling a little anxious in her heart, she blocked the spear shaft with the double knives, said "How powerful," jerked the horse, jumped out of the circle, and ran away with the horse. Li Xin thought that the Red Maiden was defeated and was about to capture her alive to show off his ability. He squeezed the horse with his legs and chased after her closely. (32)

Kunling Han Suqiu had a miscarriage a month ago, but before a month had passed, she obeyed her parents' orders and returned to the stage of the Dachan Theater, which resulted in postpartum complications. Recently, Suqiu and her parents had another conflict, so she resolutely left her family and moved to New Madrid. This stimulation caused her old illness to recur, and her condition was very serious. Her family members asked a doctor to see her, and it was determined that she had postpartum complications mixed with typhoid fever. If she is not treated well, it is quite dangerous. This is also a page of tears in the history of female actors.

Since Wu Sheng Zhang Erpeng stopped performing at the Kader Theater, he has been working hard at home. Recently, he felt that Shanghai had no place for him to use his talents, and he felt very depressed. He wanted to go to the outer docks to do something. I feel that he is just formally starting out and should be careful about where he goes. Places like Guilin and Kunming need young actors, so he might as well go. I hope he won't leave a lifelong stain on himself due to the impulse of "wanting to be the main character."

### Opening Up the "Devil's Island"

— Wang Xuan

France has a "Devil's Island" where criminals are imprisoned, and the prisoners in the island's prison are living a life without hope. The United States has made several films with the "Devil's Island" prison as the background. In order to avoid international disputes, these films only lightly describe the situation in the island's prison. Warner Brothers made a film in 1938 called "Devil's Island," which gave a naked description of the cruel treatment suffered by the prisoners on the island. This aroused French opposition, and the French authorities even threatened to ban Warner Brothers films from being shown in France. Warner Brothers then took back the film "Devil's Island" and didn't even show it in the United States, and the matter subsided. Now that the French situation has changed, Warner Brothers has decided to make another film with "Devil's Island" as the background, called "The Widow of Devil's Island," written by playwright Nigel Smith, and starring the famous Bette Davis. The content tells the story of a woman who commits a crime, and her husband is imprisoned on "Devil's Island" and suffers.
