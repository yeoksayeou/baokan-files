Editorial

### A Historical Review of British-Japanese Relations

Reviewing the history of the Far East over the past forty years, British-Japanese relations are the most important link in it. It goes without saying that the British-Japanese alliance existed for twenty years. Even after the alliance was abolished by the Washington Conference, Japan's dependence on Britain and Britain's compromise to Japan still invisibly supported the overall situation in the East. Now that hostile relations have clearly formed between Britain and Japan, and among the so-called die-hard British conservatives, there are still many who long for the British-Japanese relations of the past golden age. Therefore, at this critical juncture in the Far East crisis, the London Times, which has always been known for its pro-Japanese stance and conservatism, suddenly published an incisive essay criticizing Japan's policies, concluding that Japan is guiding its national destiny into a severely dangerous situation. Invisibly, it echoed the various warnings recently issued by the United States to Japan. The significance of this should not be taken lightly.

A person whose mental state has changed and is somewhat insane will probably not listen to any sincere advice or warnings. Even if the essay is unprecedentedly incisive and profound, it will definitely not receive any good response in Japan. It is expected that it may be answered with激切and狂言. However, for a British conservative faction that has consistently been pro-Japanese to express such a view today, it is by no means an accidental intuition, but precisely a conclusion reached through long-term forbearance and major sacrifices.责之切often arises from爱之殷. The author must have had deep love and expectations for Japan before, but in the end, it was extreme disappointment. The responsibility for this should naturally be borne by the Japanese authorities in recent years.

The reason why Japan jumped from a semi-colonial status to rank among the contemporary powers is partly due to the merits of the general military and political figures before and after the Meiji Restoration, but internationally, it largely depended on the support and assistance of the British side. The success of Mutsu Munemitsu's movement to revise the Anglo-Japanese Treaty before the Sino-Japanese War invisibly increased Japan's courage to expand externally, and the establishment of the Anglo-Japanese Agreement in 1894 appropriately became an important opportunity for Japan to dare to wage war against China, just as the Anglo-Japanese alliance in 1902 marked the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War. In order to contain Imperial Russia and Germany to maintain its hegemony in the Far East and the Pacific, the British Empire at that time had to seek help from this emerging island nation. However, the benefits Japan obtained from Britain far exceeded the support it provided to Britain. As a result, it was able to extend its power into the Asian continent and the South Pacific, forming a powerful empire with vast colonies. By the time the European War broke out, the Allied Powers needed Japan even more, and Japan took advantage of this relationship to acquire Germany's possessions in the Pacific, coercing China to accept the Twenty-One Demands. As the London Times article pointed out, "Japan enjoyed years of prosperity and peace as a result of the Allied Powers' bloodshed and financial exhaustion." Later, the Washington Conference frustrated both the Anglo-Japanese relationship and Japan's expansionist ambitions, but due to the existence of various complex international factors, cooperation between Britain and Japan in the Far East continued. After the September 18 Incident, the support given to the Japanese side by the British government was undoubtedly the main reason why Japan was able to escape severe international sanctions and further expand its expansion plan. However, these friendships from the British side that far exceeded the level of fairness did not receive any gratitude or reward at first. In the end, the threat turned to itself, suffering an unprecedented crisis of withdrawing from the Far East. During this period, the British side also made several attempts to compromise, preparing to make great concessions and demeaning, even to the point of disregarding justice and fairness, in order to maintain the traditional relationship between the two countries. However, it ultimately failed to preserve the integrity of British Far Eastern interests, nor could it prevent Japan from joining the camp of Britain's enemies. When the Tripartite Pact was formally established, the British-Japanese friendship that had lasted for fifty years had to declare its final bankruptcy due to Japan's greed and arrogance. If the Japanese authorities calmly reviewed this evolutionary process, comparing the previous ability to get along with everyone to the current isolation and exhaustion, they would probably inevitably feel lost!

In today's international community, it is somewhat pedantic to talk about morality. However, in any case, human culture has entered an era in which it can distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil, beyond interests. It is difficult for the world today to tolerate a country that only seeks opportunities and advantages, and disregards the minimum amount of trust that a country relies on for survival, even if it can act recklessly for a while. Moreover, whether it is an individual or a country, if it is always frightened by interests and desires, its reason and intelligence will inevitably be affected, and the strength on which it relies to achieve its desires will also be affected. Hostility towards Britain has formed a common view among the Japanese government and the public in recent years. All the failures caused by the Japanese authorities' own mistakes and the setbacks suffered by blind external actions are blamed on Britain, as if only Britain is Japan's greatest obstacle. In fact, just as the Japanese authorities in the past always said that the reason why they could not defeat China was because of British support, but when British aid to China was reduced to the maximum extent, the Japanese army did not harvest slightly more results than before, but instead appeared more decadent and exhausted. It can be seen that Britain is only equal to the lamb that is sacrificed for the Japanese authorities. Now, the general extremists in Japan believe that Britain is about to collapse and Japan should not miss the opportunity (?); for the time being, leaving aside American aid, let's look at Japan's case of being near China and already devoting the greatest effort to it, and falling into a quagmire due to miscalculation. Its case with Britain is self-evident. Italy's mistakes and the advice of previous allies are all opportunities to promote its final awakening, but if it insists on going its own way and acting recklessly to the end, then the fate of "荒墟" will probably be unavoidable for anyone.

### US President Announces Decree Expanding the Scope of Export Restrictions; An Economic Defense Committee Will Be Established to Jointly Blockade the Axis Powers with Britain

Washington: President Roosevelt announced yesterday that he had placed the machinery of oil wells and refineries,雷,　續, and leather under an export visa system. The President said that the export of these items should be controlled due to the urgent needs of national defense. This decree will take effect on February 10. (United Press dispatch, 5th)

Washington: President Roosevelt has ordered that, starting next Monday, four items—oil well refining machines,雷錠,　, and leather—should all be handled in accordance with the export licensing procedures related to national defense. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Washington: News was leaked here yesterday that the United States will soon establish an interdepartmental Economic Defense Committee so that the US government can join the United States in an economic blockade of the Axis powers. The purpose of the committee is to aid Britain, but its power will allow the US government to control the economic relations between the US and the rest of the world. (International News Agency dispatch, 5th)

The British Minister of Commerce stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the government is studying a plan to permanently establish a British goods promotion office in the United States. The government has given various encouragements to the sale of British goods in the United States, such as export credit loans and other conveniences. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Washington: President Roosevelt stated at an intelligence conference yesterday that he had not heard of freezing foreign funds in the past ten days. The impression in private financial circles here that the United States will soon freeze all foreign funds has gradually deepened. However, officials said that they had no knowledge of the rumor in New York banking circles that the freeze would be realized yesterday. Treasury officials said that there would be no freezing of foreign funds yesterday or today. At present, the government's policy on freezing foreign funds cannot be obtained from other official sources. (United Press dispatch, 5th)

### The US Lend-Lease Bill Will Be Passed at the End of March; Seven Governors Issue Statements Endorsing the Bill; The US Enhances British Air Defenses with Airplanes

Washington: Reliable government sources say that between December and January, 90 percent of American aircraft have been handed over to Britain. In March, the monthly output of American aircraft may exceed 1,000, but it is unclear how many of them can be military aircraft and how many commercial aircraft. At the same time, many observers believe that the Lend-Lease Bill will be passed by the end of March in order to cope with the Axis powers' spring offensive. Most well-informed circles believe that although the production of American aircraft cannot give Britain any huge assistance, the United States will be able to find ways to enhance Britain's air defenses as much as possible with aircraft that have been subordinate to the Army and Navy, or even "flying fortresses", so that they can cope with the German空中閃電戰. Those who oppose the Lend-Lease Bill predict that this action is likely to be implemented, so they accuse the government of attempting to "send the navy and air force to others". In reality, the main point of the Lend-Lease Bill will empower the President to hand over military equipment to foreign countries when he deems it necessary, regardless of the Johnson Act. The bill also includes opening ports and bases for the repair of British ships. The opposition agrees to lend Britain a credit loan of 200 million US dollars, but does not agree to give the president the power to donate military equipment. (United Press dispatch, 5th)

Washington: When the House of Representatives began the second day of debate on the Lend-Lease Bill, Democrat Lee Gaskins announced that he would abandon his previous isolationist stance and strongly urged Congress to pass the bill, saying that the passage of the bill would make the dictators中心惶懼. The governors of South Carolina, Florida, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Virginia, a total of seven people, have sent a telegram to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stating that they support the bill, saying that this is necessary for national security. At the same time, General Hoot, chairman of the American First Committee, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that he intended that if the Lend-Lease Bill is passed, the United States may join the war within ninety days. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Washington: Government leaders yesterday night pointed out with a more confident attitude that the Lend-Lease Bill could be passed by the House of Representatives before the weekend. Republican Congressman Weis Edwards of New York State, who has been the leader of the anti-New Deal faction for several years, strongly supported the government's position. When the House of Representatives debated the bill yesterday, he took the lead in criticizing those in the Democratic and Republican parties who opposed the bill, delivered a shocking speech, calling for national unity and authorizing President Roosevelt to mobilize national resources in times of emergency. However, he suggested that the aid program should be limited to 400 million US dollars and that the validity period should be limited to July 1, 1943. (International News Agency dispatch, 5th)

Washington: Former Columbia Professor and historian Beard told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that President Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Bill would formally involve the United States in the European and Asian wars, endangering everything that the American people hold dear. "This bill is actually a bill that is not suitable for war, so Congress must decide for itself whether it is willing to let the United States resort to force to care for the European war and plunge the whole world into a great fire, or whether it is willing to firmly avoid war and make the United States a sacred fortress of freedom." Congress must also decide whether it is willing to allow Britain to take unlimited aid from the US treasury to preserve Britain's economy. "Is Congress willing to pour out American assets to help the Chongqing National Government win?" Also yesterday, retired Major General Ilio, a military expert, said that the crisis the United States is currently in is because the balance of power in Europe has collapsed. The combined manpower of Britain and the United States is not enough to counter the Axis powers, but the economic foundations of the Axis powers are very fragile. He believes that in some cases, going to war with Japan is more worthwhile, but the United States' handling of foreign policy in the Far East is very wise, so it will not go to war. (United Press dispatch, 5th)

### The US Plans to Build a Super Highway with Six Lanes in Each Direction, Extending 400 Miles

New York: The United States may accelerate the construction of a super highway for national defense needs. The highway starts from Washington and ends in Boston, with a length of 400 miles. The construction cost of the highway will be US$250,000,000. The highway will be built on specially purchased land. The super highway may have twelve lanes wide. The highway has six lanes in each direction, with three lanes for slow vehicles and three lanes for fast vehicles. The highway will cross seven states and Baltimore (Maryland), Wilmington (Delaware), Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Trenton, New Brunswick, Newark (New Jersey), Norwalk, Bridgeport, and New Haven (Connecticut). The area it includes has a quarter of the total population of the United States and may be the richest industrial area in the world. From a military perspective, it is also one of the most important locations. Stinner, a member of the New Jersey Highway Commission, once told the American Road Builders Association here that the highway under design is very important. Stinner said that Hitler's first step in preparing for war was to expand all airports and highways as much as possible. On the other hand, the French's tragic defeat was also due to the fact that the country did not have appropriate highways for civil transportation and mechanized tactics. We have not forgotten the chaos of the French people on the narrow roads and the defenders' inability to establish an important line of defense. (Taiwan Public Dispatch, 5th)

### Speech by Former Japanese Navy Minister Nagano

Tokyo: Admiral Osami Nagano, a member of the Supreme Military Council and former Minister of the Navy, recently gave a speech at a certain cultural institute, expressing his admiration for the spirit of the American people and sincerely speaking about the importance of national unity in Japan during wartime. It is said that the Japanese people, when comparing the British and the Americans, always think that the American character is not as good as the British. It is important to know that in terms of courage, initiative, and hard work, the Americans are by no means inferior to the British. The United States is one of the greatest countries in the world. Nagano also said that the China Incident may not be resolved soon. As for how to resolve it, it depends on the unity of the entire Japanese nation. We must not underestimate the weak enemy, nor should we fear the strong enemy. The United States is a strong country, but the Japanese should not fear it. Japan is in a very serious situation today, and the naval officers and men are determined to do their best and be loyal to the country. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### US Steps Up Shipbuilding: Completes Two-Ocean Navy; Shipyards Located on East and West Coasts Constructing Over Two Thousand New Fleets

Washington: Navy officials revealed yesterday that the United States is constructing a total of 2,138 new-style fleets of various types in 84 shipyards to complete its unprecedented two-ocean navy. Navy officials stated that the purpose of this current undertaking is to build 730 principal fleets, including battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. The current naval strength of the United States consists of 322 such principal fleets. However, officials also stated that the Navy is building a large number of auxiliary ships. Although these auxiliary ships are not included in the regular naval fleets, it is generally expected that they will play an important role in future naval plans. The United States is now accelerating its shipbuilding efforts to increase the naval strength of the current 322 principal fleets and to substantially reorganize the recently established three independent fleets in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Asia. The 2,138 fleets currently under construction include 16 giant battleships, 139 destroyers, 14 cruisers, and auxiliary ships such as minesweepers, submarine chasers, barges, submarines, aviation rescue boats, target boats, seaplanes, motorboats, and torpedo boats. Naval shipyards are now located on both the east and west coasts, and it is reported that four auxiliary ships are being built in a shipyard in the Philippines. Naval experts also say that most of these ships will be completed by 1941. The first batch of completed ships will be assigned to the Atlantic Fleet to build a considerable combat force.

### US to Seize Axis Ships

It is also understood that officials from the Treasury Department and the Maritime Commission are studying the use of Danish ships docked here. It is believed that these ships can be obtained without forced seizure. (United Press dispatch, 5th)

### Dutch East Indies and Japan in Trade Negotiations; Newspapers Say Talks Will Resume

Tokyo: According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Dutch East Indies proposed to the Japanese Consul-General in Batavia yesterday to resume trade negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese side has agreed to this proposal, and negotiations will begin in Tokyo within days. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 5th)

Tokyo: The Chugai Commercial News commented on the Dutch East Indies' opposition to Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," stating that the Dutch government's opposition is insignificant. Japan will proceed according to its planned schedule and hopes that the Dutch government will reconsider for the sake of the East Indies. The Dutch East Indies is merely a colony of a defunct country, and its queen ekes out a living under British protection. The Dutch East Indies government is pitiable, and although perhaps not voluntarily, it has been placed under the yoke of the British government, from which it is now difficult to extricate itself. The Miyako Shimbun stated that the policies and will of the Dutch government, which has fled to Britain, are actually the policies and will of the British government. The only path for the development of the Dutch East Indies is to cooperate with Japan with a broad vision of the world situation. It is foolish and incomprehensible for the Dutch East Indies to be manipulated by Britain and the United States and to willingly perish with its home government. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Yoshizawa Officially Denies Rejecting Dutch East Indies Protest

Domei had reported that Ohashi had rejected the protest of the Dutch Minister to Japan, Pabst, denying the Dutch East Indies' inclusion in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Local officials, therefore, considered Ohashi's remarks inexplicable. Ohashi's comments have threatened the negotiations here. Yoshizawa's statement said that he had received a telegram from Tokyo denying Domei's report. (United Press dispatch, 5th)

### Most Economical New Method of Catching Fish and Shrimp

Tokyo: The "Hochi Shimbun" recently reported that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has invented a "most economical method of catching fish" to improve the country's aquatic products. The main point is to lower a huge rotating machine into the seabed. Once the engine is started, the seabed sediment is stirred up, and the fish, shaken by the disturbance, float to the surface and swim into the nets. It requires little effort and yields a large harvest. Recently, based on this principle, a new method of catching lobsters has been invented: drilling holes in the rocks to induce lobsters to inhabit them, and then taking the opportunity to catch them, making it easy to catch them all in one net. It is said that this method will be tested soon. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### British Forces in Libya Advance Beyond Cyrene: British Forces in East Africa Launch Offensive; Pursue Italian Forces Approaching Keren

Cairo: British Empire forces in Libya have advanced west along the coast of Cyrenaica from Derna and occupied the town of Cyrene, a few miles from the coast (50 miles west of Derna and about 130 miles from Benghazi). The British vanguard is expected to have advanced beyond Cyrene. The capture of Cyrene by the vanguard on Sunday was announced by the communique, which also stated that British forces operating in Eritrea are now approaching Keren (50 miles east of Agordat on the railway to Massawa). Italian forces retreating from Barentu are also being pursued. A large number of Italian soldiers have been captured. At the same time, British Empire forces advancing from Kenya have penetrated 60 miles into Italian East Africa. According to the communique, British vanguard patrols are advancing in various areas on the front line, capturing several enemy soldiers and seizing artillery and munitions. British casualties are very light. Vanguard patrols in several locations have penetrated 60 miles into enemy territory. The British African forces are engaged in patrol activities, which the enemy forces cannot match. Most of the patrols are operating in hot, desolate, and rugged country. General Graziani, the former commander of the Italian army, established his headquarters in Cyrene when he initially invaded Egypt. Brief messages received by the headquarters of Lieutenant General Wavell, the British commander in Cairo, did not indicate that the Italian army had put up a strong resistance in Cyrene. It was generally believed that the Italian army would hold the town to the end and only engage in a rearguard action when they could no longer withstand the pressure of the British army. The British army is advancing deeper into Italian Africa day by day. Since launching the offensive towards Eritrea, they have advanced 150 miles. Although the town of Keren has no strong defenses and is strategically unsuitable for resisting a large-scale attack, the retreating Italian army may make a stand in the town. To the south, an Italian column that was driven out of Barentu is still retreating east, crossing the rugged countryside and retreating towards the road between Asmara and Addis Ababa, 40 miles south of Cosmara. After cutting off the retreat of several small units of Italian forces in the mountains, the British vanguard captured a number of Italian soldiers. The enemy forces retreated along mule tracks, making their march difficult and forcing them to abandon their surplus equipment, including several tanks and artillery pieces. Italian forces in northern Abyssinia continue to retreat towards Gondar, laying obstacles along the way to hinder the British army. However, the British army is following closely and has reached a place about 30 miles from the Sudanese border. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

British aircraft also assisted the army in its advance in Italian Eritrea and continued to attack enemy forces, destroying one Italian aircraft.

### After Weeks of Silence, German Planes Again Launch a Large-Scale Attack on England; Bombed Areas are Extensive; British Air Force Engages and Shoots Down Four German Planes

London, news this morning stated that London suffered its most intense night raid in weeks last night, and a large group of German planes flew over the East Midlands, engaging in aerial combat. Gunfire was heard in the air from the ground. Two bombs fell on a town in the East Midlands, and several bombs also fell in another area of the Midlands. Bombs also fell in northwest England, killing three people and destroying one house. Last night, German planes flew over the southeast coast from time to time. At one point, the sound of a large group of planes was heard from the mainland. A high-explosive bomb fell on a town on the banks of the Thames, near a theater. Several shops, government offices, and a hotel suffered heavy damage. Fires in several places were quickly extinguished by firefighters. It is expected that the number of casualties will be high. The air raid alarm in London went off at 7 p.m. After the alarm, anti-aircraft guns were fired immediately. Yesterday's air raid was likely due to the good weather in the Dover Strait, where the sky was clear and the cliffs of Boulogne and Calais on the opposite shore were clearly visible. At 8 p.m., air raiders were heard over a town in the West Midlands. German planes were also reported in Liverpool, the East Midlands, and other northwest towns. After the alarm in London at 7 p.m., there was a brief pause. At 8:40 p.m., anti-aircraft fire erupted again, followed by another pause. At 9:20 p.m., anti-aircraft guns were fired in every district, and incendiary bombs fell. Southwest England and Wales were also attacked yesterday after three weeks of quiet. Bombs fell on the outskirts. (United Press, 5th)

London, although German planes were less active yesterday, the British Air Force shot down four of them. According to an Air Ministry communiqué, on Tuesday morning, an enemy bomber sneaked into a city on the east coast and dropped bombs, damaging several houses and public service facilities. A fire broke out in one place and was quickly extinguished, with minor casualties. British military fighters shot down an enemy plane off the coast of Suffolk. Besides that, enemy aircraft were scarce in the British sky. A small number of bombs fell in the Canterbury area, and material damage and casualties were reportedly slight. In the afternoon, British military fighters shot down two enemy fighter-bombers off the Thames Estuary and another off the coast of Kent. No British planes were lost. The Air Ministry further announced details of the shooting down of German planes, stating that a German Dornier 17 bomber sneaked into a city in East Anglia yesterday morning and dropped bombs from 3,000 feet above the clouds. Two Hurricane planes from the British Burma Squadron spotted it and swooped down to attack. The German plane hurriedly dropped the remaining bombs and fled. The British planes pursued fiercely, and the enemy plane was hit and crashed into the sea. Yesterday afternoon, two Spitfire British planes were flying at 2,000 feet off the southeast coast when they saw two Messerschmitt German planes diving down. One of the Spitfires (whose pilot had shot down several enemy planes and received the Distinguished Flying Cross) dived down and strafed one of the German planes, destroying it in just seven seconds. The other German plane was damaged before it could escape into the clouds. A Hurricane British plane also shot down two enemy Messerschmitt planes near the Thames Estuary. Since the beginning of this year, including yesterday's four, a total of thirty enemy planes have been shot down while attacking England. One British plane was also lost. This month, five German planes have been destroyed, and no British planes have been lost. (Reuters, 5th)

### British Air Force Groups Fiercely Attack French and Belgian Ports

London, after resuming large-scale night raids on Germany, the British Air Force launched two more daytime attacks on the French coast this afternoon. Residents of the southeast coast of England witnessed a large number of bombers escorted by fighters returning from the European continent, but details of the air raids have not yet been announced. Several hours later, six or seven French and Belgian ports from Ostend to Bordeaux, as well as German railway traffic and factory targets in Düsseldorf, were again fiercely attacked by the British Air Force. The longest-attacked target was the naval base in Brest, which caused a fire and subsequent explosions, with black smoke rising to over 9,000 feet, apparently caused by burning oil. The Germans also lost a significant amount of oil in Bordeaux, where the fire was no less intense than in Brest. In Düsseldorf, Germany, two railway junctions were hit, and a train was completely burned. The British planes lost a total of four planes in the above attacks. (Reuters, 5th)

Anyone who believes that the British people are not united is deluded. Prime Minister Churchill has the qualities of leadership, thoughtfulness, courage, experience, and wealth. I don't know if there is anyone else in history who is more suitable for this job than Churchill. The British government is composed of people with different political and economic beliefs. I have met with various members of the government. I have never seen a group engaged in a common task that is more united and cooperative." Willkie declined to comment on the Southern Ireland base, and said that he had not been invited to Germany. Willkie did not mention his trip to the industrial area of ​​northwest England, saying that he had collected a lot of information about production methods and was very impressed by the relationship between the government, labor, and capitalists.

### Romania's Alignment with the Axis Powers Proves More Harm Than Good; the Country is Devastated After the Incident; the Government is Working Hard to Deal with the Aftermath

Bucharest, after the Antonescu cabinet worked hard to suppress the Iron Guard rebellion, although the whole country has generally been pacified, after several months of incidents, the country is devastated. How to deal with the aftermath and how to revive the country are extremely difficult tasks for the current government. Since the outbreak of the European War, Romania has been nominally in a neutral position, but the impact it has suffered due to the war has been the most significant. It has lost two-thirds of its territory and one-third of its population, and has repeatedly made concessions to Hungary, the Soviet Union, and Bulgaria, to the extreme detriment of its sovereignty and interests. In September last year, the national system was completely changed, the abdicated king left, and the new monarch ascended the throne. At that time, the Antonescu cabinet faced numerous serious problems, the most important of which was to restore the people's confidence in the country. The people of the country had long lost faith in the parliamentary and party system, and the policies pursued by the abdicated King Carol II not only failed to promote national unity, but were enough to divide the national sentiment. The subsequent division of territory was the result of this. After the abdication of the king, the government once fell into the hands of the Iron Guard, which at that time received the support of some people. Unfortunately, it made many mistakes, which eventually led to the bloody tragedy of January. At present, the incident has been roughly pacified. The current task of the Antonescu cabinet is to unite all people of good will and those who have some experience in public life, and to overcome difficulties together under the guidance of the government. Fortunately, with regard to diplomacy, the government has thoroughly implemented the Axis policy, and will not encounter such difficulties in the future. It is safe to wait for the development of the international situation. In short, since the pacification of last month's rebellion, the domestic situation has generally become stable. What the country regards as important are a fully equipped army and healthy and strong farmers. At present, there is no longer any brewing of splitters or autonomists in the country, which is extremely beneficial to Romania, which is located in southeastern Europe. (Havas, 4th)

### A Detailed List is Released to Severely Punish the Traitors

Bucharest, a semi-official statement was issued yesterday, containing a list blaming the recent Iron Guard rebellion, which resulted in many deaths and material damage, on the people on the list. The first person is Iron Guard leader Sima, followed by former Interior Minister Petre Vivescu, former Police Chief Chica, and other less important ambitious figures. The statement continued that the documents obtained had proved that the rebellion had been planned for a long time, with the aim of using weapons and ammunition obtained from police stations and gendarmerie across the country, under the pretext that the Iron Guard police needed weapons and ammunition. Forty-four people have now been charged with participating in the rebellion and are being tried by military courts, of whom thirty-six have been sentenced to imprisonment for three months to five years, and fined between 2,000 and 100,000 lei. The remaining eight people have been released. (Reuters, 5th)

### Bulgaria: Pro-German Cabinet Members Resign; Bardossy Succeeds as Hungarian Foreign Minister; Justice Minister of Southern Country Changes

Budapest, it was officially announced here last night that former Minister to Romania, Bardossy, ​​has been appointed as the Hungarian Foreign Minister to fill the vacancy left by the recent death of Count Csaky. At the same time, according to news arriving here from Sofia, Bulgarian Minister of Agriculture and close friend of King Boris of Bulgaria, Bagrianov, and Minister of Commerce Chagolov, after some disputes over Bulgaria's economic issues, have resigned from their cabinet positions. Some Balkan foreign experts believe that Bagrianov is one of the most forceful advocates of close cooperation between Bulgaria and Germany. Observers believe that Mr. Bagrianov has a significant relationship in determining Bulgaria's foreign policy. It is said that Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov has personally taken over Mr. Bagrianov's position. It was also reported here today that another cabinet of a Balkan country has also undergone changes. The Yugoslav Justice Minister, Magovic, has resigned, and the successor is a professor at Belgrade University, Konstantinovic. Some political figures say that Magovic is "not sufficiently opposed to democracy." (International Telegraph, 5th)

Sofia, the resignation of Bulgarian pro-Axis Minister of Agriculture, Agriyanov, was due to differences of opinion with other cabinet members on Bulgaria's economic policy. According to Mr. Ba, he recently visited the Axis countries and met with Hitler and Mussolini. After returning to China, he once delivered a speech at the National Assembly, advocating reforming the national economy according to fascist principles. King Bao did not approve of this, and the cabinet refused his proposal, so Mr. Ba resigned. (Reuters, 5th)

Southern Country Capital, political figures here comment on the international political situation and pay attention to the following three points: (1) The resignation of Bulgarian Minister of Agriculture, Agriyanov; (2) The Hungarian Parliament's approval of the Hungarian-Southern Friendship Treaty; (3) The Soviet News Agency's statement that the Soviet Union has no binding on Turkey. The semi-official side of the Southern Country believes that the Soviet Union's statement proves that Turkey must rely on its own strength to resist British activities. The resignation of the Bulgarian Minister of Agriculture is a sign of Filov's and Bagrianov's inability to compromise. Mr. Ba is a champion of the Axis policy. Once he forms a cabinet, Bulgaria will join the Tripartite Pact, and domestic affairs will also imitate totalitarian countries. The approval of the Hungarian-Southern Friendship Treaty is the result of the increasing strengthening of Hungarian-Southern relations. (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)

Chongqing, Central Committee Member Chen Bulei wrote an article in the Central Daily News on the 5th mourning Jin Huating, roughly saying that Huating's death was a sacrifice, a sacrifice for the country. I cannot help but respect and mourn him. In terms of personal friendship, he was a good friend who spent time together day and night more than ten years ago. In terms of public friendship, he was a brave journalist who sacrificed for the country. As a retired journalist, I feel even more infinitely sad. Huating was the most determined and capable, and also the most determined to uphold national interests, journalist. But Huating's easy-going attitude, his sincerity to friends, and his loyalty to his duties are unforgettable. He was very innocent, very generous, willing to help friends, and never cared about personal gain. No matter how heavy the duties or how difficult the economy, he would never be casual or perfunctory. He had a clear understanding of where justice lay, so his judgment was very keen and his reports were very accurate. He recorded everything he heard, and his courage in his work influenced many colleagues to progress along with the National Revolution. He helped Shen Bao, helped the National Revolution, and indeed fulfilled the responsibilities of a journalist to the country and the nation. Especially since the incident, his efforts have been even more vigorous, which is the glory of the old friends on Wangping Street in those years. Now he has sacrificed his life for righteousness. Looking at the Shanghai coast from afar makes the old friends feel sad. I believe that Mr. Shao Lizi, who is far away in Moscow (and is also one of Huating's closest friends), will surely shed tears of sorrow when he hears the news. (Telegraph, 5th)

International Anecdotes (3)

### Japan's Covetousness of the Dutch East Indies

This is the fourth "uncensored report" from Mr. Tomi Hiraku, former publisher of the Japanese Hirochi Newspaper, after he returned to the United States. It is translated and recorded below:

The Japanese government initially sent Trade Minister Kobayashi to the Dutch East Indies to negotiate economic issues, but he returned without success. Kenkichi Yoshizawa, who served as Foreign Minister in the Inukai Cabinet in 1932, has now been dispatched to continue the negotiations. The issue of the Dutch East Indies has become increasingly important in the minds of the Japanese, but after a year of negotiations, it has not been resolved. Therefore, it is generally believed that Yoshizawa's mission is Japan's last attempt.

Because of the stagnation of trade with European countries, the American embargo on raw materials, and the inability to fully develop "Manchukuo" and the occupied areas of China, Japan's ambition to covet the interests of the Dutch East Indies has become increasingly urgent. On the other hand, the Japanese military, frustrated by the war against China, is also eager to find another way, hoping to "lose in the east but gain in the west."

Saito, the former Japanese Consul-General in Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, launched secret negotiations with the Dutch East Indies authorities on a new commercial treaty in January last year, but there was not much progress. One of the conditions put forward by the Japanese side was to demand that the Dutch East Indies supply Japan with three times more kerosene than it currently does. However, the Dutch East Indies authorities, in addition to stating (1) that there would be no restrictions on trade with Japan, (2) that Japan could directly negotiate with the Dutch East Indies business community on related matters, and (3) that payment would be made in Dutch currency, were unwilling to make any further concessions.

The situation was not serious at the time, until April last year, when German troops gathered on the Dutch border, ready to invade the Netherlands at any time. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita of the Yonai Cabinet issued a statement saying that Japan was paying attention to any developments that might affect the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. As a result, the Dutch East Indies issue became the focus of the Far Eastern situation. The Yonai Cabinet's statement was not accidental. It had carefully considered its effect in advance to test the reaction of the countries concerned, especially the attitudes of the United States and Germany.

At that time, US Secretary of State Hull immediately replied, saying that from the American point of view, any change in the status quo of the Dutch East Indies would not only harm the peace of the region, but also the peace of the entire Pacific. The Japanese still feel that Hull's warning is still ringing in their ears and is the most powerful obstacle to any military action by Japan. Since Hull's tone was exactly the same as Arita's, the Japanese side naturally could not find any loopholes, so the official response had to admit that the views of the Japanese and American governments coincided. In fact, how could the Japanese not know that Hull meant something else, which was the opposite of their meaning, and was actually a warning to Japan not to regard the Dutch East Indies as a forbidden fruit.

On May 11 last year, after Germany invaded the Netherlands, Arita issued a second statement, reiterating Japan's concern for the Dutch East Indies, in order to test the reaction of Germany, because Germany's attitude had not been expressed. In the eleven days after Arita issued his second statement, the Japanese speculated about how Germany would respond. On May 22, when the Japanese government received a reply from the German Ambassador Ott, saying that Germany was "not interested" in the Dutch East Indies issue, they were relieved. The Japanese side interpreted Germany's reply as a signal hinting at Japan's "advance."

Since Germany had issued this signal, Japan began to eagerly consider how to proceed. At this time, opinions in official circles were divided into two factions: one faction advocated using both negotiation and pressure to monopolize the economic interests of the Dutch East Indies; the other faction advocated immediately seizing the Dutch East Indies and including it in the "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere." When Koiso, the Minister of Colonial Affairs of the Yonai Cabinet, returned from an informal inspection of the Dutch East Indies in August and told a Domei News Agency reporter that the natives of the Dutch East Indies colonies had been "oppressed and exploited for a long time," the faction advocating armed seizure felt even more justified.

The Japanese government initially planned to send Koiso as a special envoy to lead a delegation to negotiate. However, Dutch Minister Pabst requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to formally retract Koiso's remarks that the Dutch authorities had mistreated the natives of the Dutch East Indies. Koiso ignored this, so Pabst, on the orders of the Dutch government in London, notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Dutch government could not agree to Koiso's appointment as a special envoy to the Dutch East Indies.

The firmness of the Dutch side's attitude was unexpected, and opinions within the Japanese cabinet were unusually divided. Finally, Trade Minister Kobayashi was appointed as a special envoy to negotiate with the Dutch East Indies, which can be regarded as a victory for the moderates. Because Koiso was originally known for advocating radical policies, his mission as a special envoy was exactly the same as Nishihara's dispatch to French Vietnam to arrange Japan's steps for advancement. Prime Minister Konoe also sided with the moderates in this dispute and was once rumored to have contracted a "minor illness," but after Kobayashi was appointed, his "minor illness" was suddenly cured.

Kobayashi stayed in the Dutch East Indies for nearly two months, but did not win any rights and interests for Japan. The Dutch authorities were simply evasive, hosting small banquets every three days and large banquets every five days. Whenever commercial issues were discussed, their attitude was very stubborn. Kobayashi demanded that the Dutch East Indies supply Japan with 1.1 million tons of aviation gasoline and 3 million tons of crude oil every year. The Dutch authorities said very gently and firmly that the Dutch East Indies only produces 233,000 tons of aviation gasoline every year, and most of it has already been allocated, and most of the crude oil has also been ordered by British and American merchants. It is said that during one negotiation, Kobayashi angrily accused the Dutch authorities of being tools of British and American imperialism, so the Dutch side stated that if Kobayashi did not retract these remarks, they would not be willing to continue the negotiations.

When Kobayashi returned to Tokyo, the only result he had obtained was that the Dutch East Indies was willing to increase the supply of aviation gasoline to Japan by 30,000 tons per year and agreed to slightly increase the supply of crude oil. This paltry amount was of course difficult to satisfy Japan's insatiable desires, and unless Japan could achieve its goals through negotiation, the power of the faction advocating armed seizure would inevitably rise. Before the reporter left Tokyo, this faction was very impatient, but judging from the fact that the Japanese government sent Yoshizawa to continue the negotiations, the Japanese moderates seemed to have gained another chance to try.

Commercial News

### Food: 25,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive; Large Quantities of Burmese Rice Will Soon Arrive in Shanghai; Prices Reach the Limit Line and Begin to Gradually Decline

Large quantities of foreign rice have been arriving in Shanghai in recent days. The Yisheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson arrived at the port the day before yesterday evening, with 12,222 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The Jiangsu Wheel of Taikoo Company arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, with 10,906 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. In addition, the Nanning Wheel arrived in port yesterday afternoon, also with 2,339 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Large quantities of Burmese rice will arrive in Shanghai in the coming days. (Ancestor)

Yesterday's foreign rice market was still hoarding in the morning, with holders unwilling to release their goods, and all prices were at the limit. Huojiao was quoted at 84 yuan, and Xiaojiao was quoted at 76 yuan. Seeing the abundant inventory and the continuous supply, and prices reaching the limit line, the buyers secretly thought that prices could only fall and not rise, and that it was too dangerous to hold at such high levels, so sales became stagnant. As a result, the holders had to change their strategy and lower their prices to sell. At this point, the market was like hitting a wall and bouncing back, not only unable to move forward, but also retreating step by step. After this setback, it was difficult to restore buying interest, and the market was generally weak, with prices gradually declining. By the close of the market, all prices were half a yuan to one yuan lower than the previous day's close. The closing prices were 81.5 yuan to 83 yuan for Grade 1 Saigon, 79.5 yuan to 77.5 yuan for Grade 2, 82 yuan to 83 yuan for Grade 1 Siamese, 80 yuan for Zhongguan, 78.5 yuan to 78 yuan for Grade 2, 82 yuan to 81.5 yuan for Huojiao, 74.5 yuan to 74 yuan for Xiaojiao, 73.5 yuan for Pudong Wharf, and 70.02 yuan for Tokyo Jianjian. Broken Jianjian was priced from 60 yuan to 61 yuan, but high-quality goods were still allocated directly to customers, and there were no samples in the market. Futures prices rose nearly one yuan in the morning, but fell continuously in the afternoon and evening, and were also weaker than the previous day's close. The opening prices were 95.6 yuan for Grade 1 Saigon for January 24 delivery, 94 yuan for January, 89 yuan for Xiaojiao for January 16 delivery, 88.45 yuan for February, and 88.5 yuan for February-March. In the afternoon, prices fell slightly to 88 yuan, and there were few buyers. The market is expected to continue to decline due to the arrival of large quantities of rice.

Due to the scarcity of national rice such as thick and thin rice, prices rose by half a yuan in the morning, following the rise in foreign rice. Later, when foreign rice weakened, the trend turned weak, and prices also fell back. Therefore, the results for thick and thin rice varied depending on the volume of transactions. Thick rice remained stable, with opening prices similar to the previous day. Thin rice fell by half a yuan. Qingjiaohu was priced at 95.5 yuan to 94.5 yuan, and the original package was priced at 98.5 yuan to 98 yuan.

Glutinous rice was more active as it was used more by pastry shops. Yesterday, the market was particularly active, with everyone selecting high-quality goods, but there were very few high-quality goods on the market, making them scarce. Xiangte Hong Kong Special Round Grain was priced at 80.07 yuan to 80 yuan, and bulk rice for cooking was also in strong demand, selling for 78-79 yuan.

### Flour and Wheat Remain on the Sidelines

Flour remained firm yesterday. There were continued inquiries from North China, but in small numbers. Because of the delay in the arrival of fixed flour and the difficulty in obtaining berths for foreign freighters, major players were thinking of defending their positions, so it was not easy to buy large quantities of spot flour in the market. Tongshi traded more than 3,000 bags of Huaniao brand Australian flour, priced at 25 yuan to 24.9 yuan, and 2,000-3,000 bags of goods arriving around the 20th, priced at 24.35 yuan, similar to previous reports. China-made discounted flour was still sold at 23 yuan, supplied by two factories with more than 6,000 bags. Customer sales were still low, and official supplies would only begin after the arrival of foreign wheat raw materials in Shanghai.

Wheat trading remained quiet yesterday. Amidst reports of scarce arrivals and inventories, Chinese factories were waiting and watching. Only Japanese factories were buying small quantities of 200-300 bags per day, priced at 32 yuan to 32.5 yuan. It is reported that since the New Year, they have only purchased 6,000-7,000 bags.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Remains Stable with No Change

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. In the unofficial market for British and American currency, buying and selling were evenly matched, with no significant fluctuations. The Hong Kong telegram was once settled at a slightly higher price due to demand exceeding supply, but soon the rumor of the US freezing funds spread, demand weakened, and prices eased. Chinese banks were selling, and speculators followed suit. This month's US exchange rate fell from 5.28125 yuan to 5.3125 yuan. There were no changes at noon. As a result, spot British and American exchange rates were both flat. The British exchange rate was 3 shillings 3.328125 pence, and the US exchange rate was 5.3125 yuan. Only the March British exchange rate was slightly soft at 0.015625 pence. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong Slightly Buys In

In the early morning, London strips and forwards were flat, New York silver prices were flat, London raw gold was fixed, and the British exchange rate against the US dollar was unchanged, but against Shanghai it decreased by 1.875, the US dollar against the British pound decreased by 0.25, the decline against Shanghai was small at 0.04, and there was no market against France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank opened its spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 3 shillings 3.328125 pence and the US exchange rate at 5.3125 yuan. The market was initially flat after the opening. Foreign banks first traded spot British exchange rates at 3 shillings 3.328125 pence. Later, due to the need for Hong Kong telegraphs, the market tightened. Foreign banks entered the Hong Kong telegram market for US exchange rates for this month at 5.3125 yuan and 5.28125 yuan. At 9:30, HSBC's listed price was announced and remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax remained unchanged. At this time, people suddenly relaxed, Chinese banks sold, speculators followed suit, but HSBC and Favored came in, and the underlying trend stabilized. The Hua Bank of China and the East Asia Bank sold the US exchange rate for February to HSBC Favored at 5.3125 yuan, and the US exchange rate for the following month at 5.28125 yuan. The afternoon situation was similar. As a result, the spot British gold exchange rate and the exchange rate for this month was 3 shillings 3.328125 pence, the US exchange rate was 5.3125 yuan, the following month's British gold exchange rate was 3 shillings 3.3125 pence, and the US exchange rate was 5.28125 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Compared with the closing price of the previous day, the US exchange rate was flat, and the current price of British gold was slightly soft at 0.015625 pence in the distant period.

The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 0.5 yuan to 90.05 yuan (United Note). The dark dish increased by 0.25 yuan to 79.25 yuan.

### Freezing Rumors Rise Again: Gold Market Wants to Rise but Falls Back

After the unofficial market for spot cash raw red gold reached a high price of 6,745 yuan yesterday, it fell back. It opened at 6,730 yuan, continuing the favorable situation in the foreign market after the close of the previous day. The Bulls bought in response to the weak exchange market and various reports. Not long after, it rose another 15 yuan. However, the atmosphere then turned negative, with rumors of the United States freezing funds rising again. Exchange merchants sold to lock in profits, and Xinfengyong and Dafeng and others all sold, falling back within the 6,700 yuan level. However, Defu and Tong Kangyong, who had recently been buying a lot, continued to maintain the price. The market was unstable at the noon close, because the foreign exchange market was loose and flat, there were more sellers, and the Bulls were selling. As a result, the price was only 6,677 yuan, a decrease of 23 yuan from the previous day. Spot goods were initially sold by Tiancheng to Qianti Defu each for 100 taels, at a price 50 yuan higher than futures. Because Defu had a strong desire to buy, it bought another 20 taels from Tiancheng, reaching 70 yuan. Finally, 65 yuan was sold. About 5,000 taels of futures were traded in half a day. Silver jewelry prices remained unchanged, and customs duties were flat.

Red Hot Gold Drops 23 Yuan

In the early morning, due to the fact that the foreign market had already risen by 20 to 30 yuan yesterday, the opening price was 6,730 yuan, and with the continued purchases by silver banks, it rose another 15 yuan to 6,745 yuan. This firm trend corresponded to the slightly soft exchange market. Later, because Dafeng, Xinfengyong, and others unanimously sold, the buying power was weak, there were few supporters, and it fell. It fell back within the 700 yuan level, seeing 6,698 yuan. Defu, Tong Kang, and Yongjin, who have been active recently, came up with ideas again and absorbed some, regaining a position outside the 700 yuan level, returning to 6,715 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange market was quite stable, and there were unfavorable rumors, people's hearts slackened, and buying interest decreased. Baoshunyuan and others sold for as little as 6,675 yuan. By the time of the noon close, it was still difficult to rise, and the result was a close at 6,677 yuan, a decrease of 23 yuan from the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon, and there was a fluctuation of 70 yuan in half a day. The selling price of cash sign gold was more than 10 yuan higher than that of raw red gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current gold price was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few trades.

Jewelry Gold Stands Firm

The selling price of silver jewelry per tael remained unchanged. Datonghang was listed at 690 yuan, and the new market was similar to the previous price, with the purchase price 30 yuan lower.

### Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the raw red market price rise and then fall again. British and American gold pounds fell by 1.5 yuan. The supply of British gold tickets was slightly strong, and the market price fell by another 1 yuan. American gold tickets initially rose to 18.7 yuan, but then gradually fell, eventually reaching 18.52 yuan, a decrease of 0.08 yuan from the previous day. Hong Kong tickets were still in demand, and the market price continued to rise. Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets rose endlessly. The former rose to 1.64 yuan, and the latter rose to 1.32 yuan.

### Securities: New Sellers Arrive in the Public Bond Market

Yesterday's public bond black market saw a glimmer of hope, as Yuxing had stopped selling. Although Fuxian sold, it bought back later. As the gangs successively covered short positions, the market rallied slightly. Unexpectedly, Yongda No. 10, which had not been in the market for a long time, suddenly came in and bravely sold four types of bonds: A, B, C, and E, selling a total of more than 500,000. Although Lianhe, Tongkang, Renchang, Lemao, Juxin, and Hengfu all covered short positions and went long, they still could not prevent the market from falling. Because Dingkang, Yitai, Jiufu, and Jiufeng also sold off, the opening price of C bonds was 5.6 yuan. After several twists and turns, the market price was still between 5.6 and 5.7 yuan. After entering, there were few buyers, and the price suddenly broke into the 5 yuan level, closing at the lowest price. The trend is expected to continue to fall. However, since the New Year, it has fallen for five consecutive days. After deducting interest, it has fallen by a huge amount of 4-5 yuan, which is not in line with the environment. Although there are rumors, they are unfounded. Moreover, those who have been shorting for many days are extremely crowded, and the future may be swirling for a while, and then rise or fall with the environment. As a result, yesterday's market price fell by another 0.55 to 0.9 yuan, with a turnover of about 2 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 102 shares of China Electric Company were traded at a price of 8 yuan.

The public stock market is very stable, and prices have risen slightly. Although the turnover is not very large, the variety is very common. Rubber shares are stable and quiet.

London, 4th (Tuesday) telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks are flat, and the market has not changed.

### Yarn and Cotton: Obstacles to Guangdong Sales; Yarn Market Falls

The yarn market, which had risen sharply since the start of the red market, has now rebounded and fallen again. It is rumored that the landing at Dapeng Bay has caused people to feel weak. At the same time, the Bulls are leaving the market, and the Bears are active again. The gold gang and the securities gang have mostly turned from long to short, so the market is becoming increasingly weak. However, the big players in the industry not only have no intention of selling, but are buying more, so the two sides are competing fiercely. 20s Shuangma real price is 1,520 yuan, and the low price is 1,489 yuan. In the afternoon, the first transaction was at 1,486-7 yuan, followed by 1,491 yuan, with a turnover of several hundred packages. Shenxin Shuangma yarn was not heard of opening on the previous day. However, according to the Shuangma yarn, the high and low prices have fallen by 50 yuan in the past two days. Today, 200 pieces of yarn are being transported to Hong Kong.

Because the market sentiment improved in the afternoon of the previous day, the market was still stable at the morning opening of Shuangma. The first opening price was 1,520 yuan. As soon as this price was opened, rumors spread in the market that the floating households who landed at Dapeng Bay were weak, and they unanimously sold. The market fell step by step to 1,508 yuan, but the industry still bought, and it went back up to 1,512 yuan. It revolved at this price for a long time, but the new buyers were cautious and did not move. The trading floor was slightly loose and fell back into the 500 yuan level. The short covering suddenly rose, and it rose to 1,508 yuan. Finally, due to the Bulls closing their positions, the market price turned down, and gradually fell to the 140 yuan level before closing. According to the transaction statistics in half a day, 8,100 packages were traded. The amount bought by each gang is as follows:

Hong Kong 150; Industry 7,950; Total 8,100

### Cotton Mills Need Small Quantities

The spot cotton situation has turned flat, because the yarn market has eased, causing people's hearts to be calm, so the industry's mutual buying and selling is not as lively as the previous day, but the factory's need for small quantities of purchases is still not lacking.

The New York cotton market fell due to spot traders selling and Bulls closing their positions. As a result, the closing price was 4 to 7 pounds lower than the previous day.

Indian cotton also eased due to Japanese traders selling and various parties selling to lock in profits. Yesterday's transportation forecast was 2 rupees lower.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market is firm, but there are not many transactions, because those who hold goods seem unwilling to sell, but there is still lively small-scale trading in which factories buy in small amounts and the industry buys and sells among themselves.

### Piece Goods: Concerns about Strikes in Guangdong Sales; More Cloth Sold

Yesterday's factory cloth market was slightly tired, because the Japanese army landed at Dapeng Bay, and the Shayuchong line was blocked, which greatly affected Guangdong sales. The number of sellers suddenly increased, and the transaction volume was very light. However, the factory's positions were still tight, so the market price was quite chaotic. The large positions were unchanged, and some of the scattered white goods, fine cloth, and coarse cloth fell by 0.15 to 0.5 yuan per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth was flat. The street traded more than 300 pieces of gray cloth and bleached and dyed cloth. The Zhejiang-Fujian gang traded more than 200 pieces of fine cloth, bleached cloth, blue cloth, and yuan cloth. The Guangdong-Hong Kong gang traded more than 100 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, coarse and fine twill. On the 6th, 370 pieces of piece goods were transported to Hong Kong.

Eastern cloth fell back yesterday due to scattered households selling to lock in profits. White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill fell by 1.3-1.4 yuan per bolt. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth spot goods once fell into the 50 yuan level. The black market was slightly firm in the afternoon, still selling for 50 yuan. The "Stock Exchange" futures closing prices were 50.07 yuan for February, 51.6 yuan for March, 52.58 yuan for April, and 53.45 yuan for May.

### English-Made Straight Tribute Serge: Supply Can't Keep Up

Yuanqing Straight Tribute Serge is quite popular and rising, especially the English-made ones are even more expensive, because the inventory is lacking, the supply can't keep up, and the inland customer gang and the street shoe gang have a keen need, which has created a situation where demand exceeds supply. The English-made Yuan Straight Tribute Serge that was listed yesterday, only Chunheyong, Huaxin, Huafutai, Xinchunhe and a few other companies still have inventory. The top English-made straight tribute serge has been approved for sale at 46-47 yuan per yard, and the average is around 40 yuan. This top-grade cargo is 30 yuan, the average is 25-26 yuan, and the domestic Yuan Straight Tribute Yinfeng Caishen Tiger is 27 yuan. Zhang Mianyang Tu Dahua Mutton Tu are all sold for 24 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Wild Rise in Abalone Shell

Abalone shell, due to the lack of supply, the market inventory is extremely lacking, and the price has risen sharply. It was more than 100 yuan last year, and yesterday it rose to 140 yuan, up more than 30 yuan, and the market is in good shape.

### Sugar Market: Actively Traded Futures Crude, All Absorbed by Hoarders

Yesterday's crude white rose slightly because hoarders absorbed more. The volume of regular futures traded was 5,000 to 6,000 packages. The trend was initially flat, then tightened. The Association of Public Accountants has drawn up a plate, and the foreign stock of regular crude white for those with bills due on February 10 is 81.4 yuan to 81.7 yuan, those with bills due on the 25th is 81.9 yuan, those with bills due at the end of this month is 81.9 yuan to 82 yuan, the spot price in this stock is 82.2 yuan, and the Dutch cotton white BS mark is still 79.5 yuan, the Dutch red is 65 yuan and a small 0.05 yuan. The Taikoo Che Bai B mark in the Western stock is 81.3 yuan and a small 0.02-0.03 yuan, and those with bills due on February 10 is 81.4 yuan, and the bottom position is tighter. The DY mark in the Western stock is 78.9 yuan to 79 yuan, up 0.4 yuan, and the Eastern stock is 78.5 yuan. The HX mark in the Western stock is 78.7 yuan, up 0.3 yuan, and the Eastern stock is 78.4 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Corn First Rises, Then Falls Back; Soybean Cake: Bulls and Bears Compete

Corn: Because of the Saigon situation and the opportunities for speculation, the market price fluctuates suddenly. Yesterday, only 200-300 packages were sold in the spot market, and the market price was unchanged. However, the Yinghua Futures Company was very popular among speculators, and the market was often at a high tide. Yesterday's highest rise was 0.6-0.7 yuan higher than the previous market. As a result, it was reduced by 0.3-0.4 yuan under the eagerness of selling, but the closing price was still slightly higher. Yinghua Exchange traded 600 packages, priced at 53.7 yuan to 54 yuan, and then to 53.7 yuan, and ordered 4,000 packages for delivery in February, priced at 54.3 yuan to 54.65 yuan.

Soybean Cake: There was no transaction in the spot market yesterday, and the trend softened. The Bulls and Bears in the futures market were evenly matched. The overall trend was rising in the front, but it fell back as a result, so there was not much change in the market atmosphere. The opening prices of various brands of futures cakes were about 60,000 pieces. For detailed market prices, please refer to the market price column. Today, 16,080 pieces of soybean cake and 395 packages of soybeans will be exported to Hong Kong.

### Coal: Stove White Coal Falls in Price

Since the beginning of winter, the stove white coal market has been in a slump due to the fine weather and the lack of sales volume. Although the red market barely showed stability, the old stock of the stack was rather tightly set, showing a clear and dark decline. Yesterday's opening price of Annam white coal, sold at the market, was 258 yuan per ton, and the Tongdeli white coal was 245 yuan. The dark market was 3-5 yuan cheaper than the market price. A vehicle was added to deliver to customers.

### Shanghai Flour Market in the Year 1930

— Zhou Xigeng

(I) Production and Sales of Shanghai Flour Mills

There are no fewer than 130 mechanized flour factories in our country. Taking Shanghai alone, there are more than 20 (unfortunately, some of them have been destroyed during the war). The daily and nightly flour production exceeds 113,000 bags. Since the outbreak of the war, some factories have been destroyed, others occupied, resulting in significant losses. Currently, the production capacity of Chinese flour mills operating in the concession area has also greatly decreased, mainly due to the occasional shortage of raw materials and sluggish sales. The harsh environment makes it difficult to maintain operations, which is why. The following table lists the Chinese flour mills operating in the concession area and those occupied in the suburbs of Shanghai:

Chinese Flour Mills Operating in the Concession Area

Chinese Flour Mills Occupied in the Suburbs of Shanghai

According to the above table, the total production capacity of the occupied factories is more than 44,000 bags of flour per day and night, and this is only for the port of Shanghai. As for the flour mills in the concession area, they gradually resumed operation after the National Army retreated westward. Initially, raw materials could still be sourced from the interior. At that time (1937 and 1938), there were no problems with transporting wheat from various wheat-producing areas in the interior to Shanghai. Later, due to the "people's" control over wheat production areas, the source became scarce, and it was necessary to order foreign wheat. At the same time, due to the decline in export sales, the production volume gradually decreased, and some flour mills even stopped production. By December of last year, the total daily production was only about 5,000 bags, and the scene was desolate, as one can imagine. Meanwhile, the Japanese, in their occupied areas within the city, used their military force to purchase cheap wheat. In addition to supplying Japanese flour mills in North and Central China with raw materials, they also loaded it onto ships, milled it in Japan, and then dumped it in North China. North China was the only sales area for flour, but after the war, it was monopolized by Japanese flour, and the transportation of domestic flour to the north completely disappeared. The flour sold in the North China market today, apart from Australian, American, and Canadian flour, is almost entirely monopolized by Japanese flour mills. Brands such as Green Treasure Ship, Green Mitsubishi, Green Emerald, and Green Flying Crane are everywhere.

(II) General Overview of Half-Price Flour

After the war, the population of the Shanghai concession increased dramatically, and the prices of all commodities soared. The price of rice became increasingly expensive, and the sales of flour were very good as a result, leading to a situation where the supply of flour could not meet the demand. The flour mills faced a limited supply of raw materials and limited production. The foreign wheat purchased was priced according to foreign currency, and the market price of foreign exchange was frequently tightening, resulting in increased costs and higher selling prices. From February 19th of last year, the Municipal Council, with the consent of the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills in the city, issued flat-priced flour for one month at a price of ten yuan and three cents per bag (including a handling fee of three cents). 7,500 bags were supplied daily and sold at the retail stores of the following 27 flour dealers. The brand name and sales volume are shown in the table below: (unit: bag)

Business Name Daily Sales Volume Business Name Daily Sales Volume

However, some cunning merchants took the opportunity to buy the flat-priced flour at ten yuan and three cents and resell it to bakeries, tea food stores, steamed bread stalls, etc. that needed flour, earning a net profit of two to three yuan per bag. Because the supply of flat-priced flour was limited, and those who needed it did not have enough to use, they had to buy it from the flour black market. At that time, the black market price of flour was as high as fourteen yuan and five cents or more per bag, so it was still cheaper to buy it at thirteen yuan and three yuan. This created a money-making opportunity for these people, who formed parties and partnerships to collect the purchased flat-priced flour in whole numbers and then sell it, with considerable profits. Dozens of people were arrested by the police for this matter, but they were all released after being warned. It is regrettable that ordinary people who really needed flour to eat could not easily buy flour. In June, the price of flour rose again and again due to the high price of raw materials. The Municipal Council tried to regulate it by selling it to wholesalers, who then sold it directly to the cake and steamed bread industry, the noodle industry, and the bakery industry, avoiding the hands of hoarders, so that these people with money would not have difficulty buying flour. However, the price was not limited, and the factory could announce the market price at any time according to the cost, plus a handling fee of three cents. At the same time, in view of the disadvantages of the first sale of flour at a flat price, the review of each household was very strict. This campaign lasted from July 2nd for more than a month, and the price was thirteen yuan and eight cents (including handling fee). In September, the flour from the interior and the flour mills in the suburbs of Shanghai were banned from being transported into the concession. At the same time, the flour mills in the concession did not have much raw material, and the sales of flour on the market were very brisk, so the price of flour soared. It is estimated that there are about 1,500 cake and steamed bread stalls in Shanghai, about 400 noodle shops, and about 50 bakeries, for a total of about 2,000.

### Taxpayers' Meeting Successfully Held Yesterday; Surcharge Case Passed; Over 7,000 People Attended Under Strict Security; Proposals by Lin Xiongji and Li De'er Rejected

The special meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession, convened on the 23rd of last month, was adjourned due to the Lin Xiongji incident. Consul-General Hill then rescheduled the meeting for 2:30 pm yesterday (the 5th) to vote on the Municipal Council's proposal to increase land tax, municipal general tax, and special property tax by 41%. Yesterday, the spring air was filled with joy, and the breeze was gentle. The Municipal Council's proposals were ultimately passed in their entirety by an absolute majority. There are several noteworthy aspects of the meeting: (1) Japanese taxpayers ultimately, as the Japanese side had previously announced, refused to attend, expressing their passive opposition to the surcharge case. Only a very small number of Japanese people and dozens of Japanese officials went to observe, which was said to be adopting a "monitoring attitude." (2) In view of the unfortunate incident that occurred in the last decision, the Municipal Council's stringent steps for precautions yesterday had placed the overall taxpayers and meeting place order in a state of absolute safety. (3) In order to facilitate the meeting's progress and resolve various misunderstandings and demonstrate democratization, the Municipal Council adopted a parallel policy of English and Japanese languages at the meeting. (4) In order to calculate the votes accurately, calculating machines were set up at the entrance to the voting decision place at the twelve places in the meeting place, so that each case was presented to the vote to obtain clear and convenient results, and the meeting ended smoothly and orderly at 5:15 pm.

Inside and Outside the Venue, Security Was Tight

The Municipal Council police authorities, in view of the unfortunate incident that occurred at the last meeting, and the Japanese intent to burn the meeting place's conspiracy, in order to strictly prevent accidents from happening, made their greatest efforts in terms of traffic order and preparedness. Police detectives were densely deployed along the racecourse area of ​​Mahoe Road, Jing'an Temple Road. Four red police vehicles were parked on the racetrack along Jing'an Temple Road inside the racecourse. Behind and around the meeting place, there were forty or fifty White Russian reservists guarding with guns. On the passageways entering the meeting place at each gate, an armed detective was stationed every two yards. Detectives were also guarding with guns on the roof of the grandstand. Japanese detectives and Western detectives were stationed at the entrance of the meeting place. The security situation inside the meeting place was also extremely strict. Western detectives and Japanese police were lined up along the passageway of the rostrum, with fifty people. At the southern end of the meeting place, there were more than a dozen police officers from the Japanese consulate watching from the stands, and Major Bowen, the superintendent of police, was also directing and dispatching everything on the spot.

More Than 7,000 People Attended Enthusiastically

The layout inside the meeting place was quite perfect. In front of the rostrum, a steel plate five meters high was built, with fresh flowers placed on it. On the right side was placed a taxpayer's speaker's platform with a microphone. The rostrum, steel plate speaker's platform, etc. were all covered with blue cloth, showing solemnity. In the center of the grandstand facing the rostrum, the front row was the "Vote Counting Seat", and the front row on both sides was the "Press Seat". On both sides of the rostrum were voting places, with twelve entrances, marked with approval and disapproval occupying six each. Each entrance had a calculator, and each had a Chinese person in charge. More than 7,000 people attended yesterday. The meeting also distributed the meeting order in English and Japanese languages for taxpayers to consult.

A Glimpse of the Rostrum

On the rostrum, two speaking platforms were placed. Sitting at the highest point were Consul General Hill, Mr. Lang, the secretary of the Consular Corps, and Mr. Ibuku, the Japanese Deputy Director General of the Municipal Council (acting as Japanese translator). The first row of the rostrum was the Municipal Council Board of Directors. Mr. Keziah, the Director General, and Mr. Kana, the Deputy Director General, sat in the first seats on the left and right. Except for Mr. Hakuo Tarō, the Japanese Director, all the other directors attended. Mr. Keziah's left hand was still injured and he was unable to use it freely. It was tied with black cloth and hung on his neck. Mr. Keziah's spirit was excellent, and every speech was clear. All taxpayers applauded to welcome him. It seems that in view of the attack on public affairs in the last decision, it seems to contain the meaning of condolences. Mr. Liddell was also welcomed by the public when he took the stage to speak, because Mr. Liddell's wording was humorous.

The Lin Xiongji Case Was First Rejected

Consul General Hill, Chairman of the meeting, with Nash as the Secretary and Ibuku, the Japanese assistant, as the Japanese translator, first explained the procedure for taxpayers to vote, and reported the names of the twenty-four vote counters. Then he asked the taxpayers to vote on the first amendment to the second item on the agenda of the last meeting, "The Municipal Council's proposal to increase land tax, municipal general tax, and special property tax", "Lin Xiongji's proposal, supported by Fukuda, to abolish the surcharge case". As a result, only five votes were in favor of Lin Weiji's proposal, while seven thousand and fifty-five votes were against it, accounting for an absolute majority. The chairman then announced that the Lin case was rejected.

Reassessment of Land Prices Begins

Then the second amendment, "Li De'er proposed, Ailington seconded, to revalue and tax self-used properties, and limit the surcharge on rental houses to 40%, and collect huge additional taxes on undeveloped land", was discussed. First, the original proposer Li De'er gave a speech, stating that the Municipal Council's expenses have increased several times since 1937. The municipal general tax has been decided to increase several times. The taxes on the owners' self-used properties are still levied according to the valuation of 1937. It seems unfair to be generous to them and stingy to others. Taking the Shanghai Electric Power Company as an example, the Municipal Council has repeatedly decided to approve the increase in surcharges, resulting in increased profits over the years. However, the land tax it pays is still based on the valuation of that year. Proportionally, the burden on small citizens is actually heavier than that of large landowners. In order to seek fairness, I hope that the audience can pass my proposal. Then Mr. Keziah, the Secretary of the Municipal Council, gave a speech, saying that the valuation is not something that can be done hastily. Currently, the expert group established by the Municipal Council is dedicated to revaluing the value of the owners' self-used land, whether the land is of an industrial or commercial nature. At the same time, the residential land used by the owners will also be revalued. However, after the valuation work is completed, the percentage of taxation will be discussed based on its value. Now, it seems arbitrary to increase the taxes by 40% across the board. This kind of policy is definitely not something that the Municipal Council can adopt. In addition, the Municipal Council plans to appoint a committee of experts to review the entire issue and order the committee to complete the report as soon as possible. If it can be approved by the Municipal Council, it can be adopted at the annual meeting of taxpayers in April. After Mr. Keziah finished his speech, the case was put to a vote. The chairman first asked the taxpayers to vote by raising their hands in order to save time, but because there were too many people raising their hands and it was difficult to count, he changed to voting again. As a result, 740 votes were in favor of Li De'er's proposal, and 6,194 votes were against it. The chairman then announced that the Li case was also rejected.

The Dairy Shed Donation Was Resolved to Increase

Then the third item on the agenda was discussed: "Li De'er proposed, Menuson seconded, to recommend that the Municipal Council not include the dairy shed license fee in the increase of various license fees". At this time, the original proposer gave a speech, saying that milk is one of the daily necessities. Increasing the dairy shed license fee is tantamount to raising the price of milk. The Municipal Council originally recommended that Grade A be taxed 15 yuan per cow per year, and Grade "A (T·T·)" be taxed 20 yuan per year. However, cows are not goods but capital, and capital has no reason to pay donations. If cows are regarded as goods and pay donations, then all kinds of goods such as foreign yarn, machinery, silk, and silk will have the obligation to pay taxes. There was a lot of humor, so the audience laughed from time to time. Later, Mr. Keziah stood up and gave a speech, reporting that the Municipal Council had collected a total of 700 yuan in license fees from the dairy sheds throughout the year, while the Municipal Council spent 100,000 taels on health services for the dairy sheds, such as hiring veterinarians. According to the investigation, the total turnover of the dairy sheds last year was 8 million yuan, and the increase recommended by this decision only amounts to 5/1000 of the total turnover. In order to compensate for the Municipal Council's losses, taxpayers should be asked to pass the Municipal Council's original recommendation. The chairman immediately announced the vote, adopting the hand-raising method due to the lateness of the hour, with the opposers and supporters raising their hands one after another. As a result, the majority opposed it, so it was rejected. When Mr. Li finished his speech, the crowd applauded enthusiastically, thinking that Mr. Li was thinking of the small citizens, but because most of the taxpayers were property owners, although his speech was very moving, the proposal he made was ultimately rejected.

### After the Taxpayers' Meeting Ended, the Municipal Council Announced the Surcharge

The Municipal Council has recently issued a notice that, according to the resolution of the special meeting of foreign nationals yesterday (the 5th), a municipal general tax of 27% will be levied from January 1st of this year, plus a surcharge of 40%, and a special property tax of 14%, plus a surcharge of 40%, and a land tax of 1.35%, plus a surcharge of 40%. The property tax on Western-style houses should be paid by the residents to the Tax and Donation Section of the Bureau at 209 Jiangxi Road upon receipt of the notice. The Bureau will not send anyone to collect it. In addition, licenses for handcarts, rickshaws, and delivery tricycles or trailers will be issued from the Vehicle Inspection Office at 557 Gordon Road from the 7th of this month. In addition, licenses for private rickshaws will also be issued at the above location from the same day. In addition, bicycle licenses will be issued at various police stations and the Tax and Donation Section of the Bureau from the 6th to the 28th of this month. In addition, licenses for billiard rooms, tobacco shops, earth courts, exchange shops, painting houses, and singers, private carriages, stables, public carriage firms, public automobile firms, various motorcycles and trailers, carrying weapons, raising dogs, dairy farms, and bakeries should be exchanged as soon as possible from now on.

### The Monroe Arrives This Afternoon With a Huge Number of Mail

The new mail ship of the world class of the American President Lines, the President Monroe, is coming east on its maiden voyage and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 10:00 am today. It is scheduled to berth at buoys 12 and 13. The crowd has already noted the report in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the mail ship is carrying a large amount of mail, totaling 1,218 bags. However, because there are only first-class passengers, there are very few passengers. Only 13 passengers will disembark in Shanghai, and only 46 passengers will travel to Southeast Asia and around the world on the original ship. It is heard that there are also very few passengers taking the ship from Shanghai. It is scheduled to depart at 5:00 am tomorrow morning and go to Southeast Asia via the Cape of Good Hope and return to Boston.

### The Shanghai West Special Police Force Will Be Established As Soon As Possible

The Shanghai Times reported that officials in charge of the establishment of the West District Special Police Force stated yesterday (the 4th) that the Special Police Force will be established on or as soon as possible after March 1st. It is learned that after the signing of the police power agreement supplementing the temporary agreement on the roads outside the West District on the 1st of this month, both parties immediately promoted the establishment of the Special Police Force. One of the purposes is to completely eliminate gambling dens and other criminal places in the area.

Police Station Address

The Special Police Headquarters is the original police station in West Shanghai. The first police station is the former Caojia Police Station. The second police station is the former Jing'an Temple Road Police Station. The third police station is the Wujiaocai Market Caojiadu Police Station. The fourth police station is newly established at the Jockey School in Yaojiajiao, Dunxin Road. The ninth police station is the Xujiahui Police Station, and five branch offices and seven police stations are added. In order to improve efficiency, reserve team members are also assigned. Currently, each police station is being renovated and repaired. It is heard that the chiefs of the third, fourth, and fifth stations will be appointed by the "City Government", and the chiefs of the first and second stations will be recommended by the Municipal Council.

### Frequent Movements of Japanese Warships Along the Coast

Since the Japanese side announced the expansion of the coastal blockade, the movements of Japanese warships along the coast have been frequent. According to reliable information from the shipping industry, Vice Admiral Shigetaro Shimada, commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, rushed to Dinghai by ship from Shanghai at the end of last month. After staying for a week, he returned to Shanghai by ship yesterday. It is heard that Shimada's trip is related to the Japanese blockade of the coast. In addition, Japanese warships have been concentrating in the Zhejiang Sea in recent days. The sea off Xiangshan Shipu has suddenly increased to six ships. Two ships are also moored off Zhenhai Port and Dinghai Sea.

Mr. Jin's relatives and friends also formed a funeral committee to handle everything. After Mr. Jin's remains were moved to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Taraswan Road in the French Concession, the burial was held at 3:00 pm yesterday, and the situation was very solemn and respectful. The following is a detailed account of each situation:

On the foreign colleagues' side, such as the British Embassy Information Office and the French Havas Agency, there were also wreaths sent. In addition, condolence letters and telegrams from Yang Xiaotian of the Seamen's Union, Chen Bai of the Two-Way Special Party Department, and Mr. Gold, the editor of the English-language Great American Evening Post, were also delivered to the funeral home yesterday, expressing their grief over Mr. Jin's loyalty, courage, and sacrifice for righteousness. There were dozens of other condolence gifts sent, which are not listed here.

The Hall Was Decorated Solemnly and Respectfully

The hall was decorated solemnly and respectfully. In the center was the altar with Qingzhuo fruits and vegetables, lit double candles, and hung Mr. Jin's portrait. His voice and appearance were as if he were still there, which made people stand in awe. Around the hall were hung full of elegiac scrolls and couplets. Yesterday, no fewer than three hundred representatives from various agencies and organizations attended, mostly from the press and Mr. Jin's relatives and friends. There were also many people who came to participate out of admiration, which shows how deeply touching it was. When the guests entered, they all bowed to the portrait and played mourning music, which was served voluntarily by the Shanghai Orphanage Orchestra. Near the hall, there were also several French Concession police detectives stationed to protect it.

Sacrificed Himself for Righteousness and Parted Forever from the World

Mr. Jin's remains were dressed in a blue robe and black coat, and the burial was held at 3:00 pm, and the remains were also viewed. All the guests circled the coffin with sad hearts. Mr. Jin's remains were vivid and lifelike, smiling and closing his eyes. Relatives and friends who went to mourn recalled Mr. Jin's life of being eager to help others and being harmed by thugs. In addition to regret, many shed tears. The sound of mourning music arose, and Mr. Jin's three children, dressed in sackcloth and white clothes, prostrated themselves in front of the coffin and cried sadly. After viewing the remains, the coffin was closed. All the guests lined up and paid the highest respect to Mr. Jin's portrait. From then on, Mr. Jin sacrificed himself for righteousness and parted forever from the world.

After the burial was completed, Mr. Jin's coffin was carried by car to the Dalu Funeral Home on Gluge Road for temporary placement. Colleagues from this newspaper and friends of Mr. Jin all followed the car and held the ropes. It is heard that the matter of Mr. Jin's coffin burial will be handled after the family decides. Yesterday's burial ceremony, Mr. Jin's wife, because she heard the bad news, her heart disease worsened, and she was unable to go to the funeral home to preside over the burial. As for Mr. Jin's original hometown, there is still an old mother at home. Since Mr. Jin was killed, she has urgently telegraphed her eldest brother. I think that when the sad news is transmitted, the high hall's sadness will be very painful.

### Japan Cuts Off Hong Kong-Shaoguan Traffic; Shanghai Goods Transport Affected; Military Supplies Never Transported Internally via this Route; Japan's Invasion of Huizhou is to Obstruct Goods

The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the Japanese army landed in Huizhou, northeast of the British Kowloon Concession in Guangdong Province yesterday (the 4th), in an attempt to cut off the important trade route from the coast there to the interior of Free China. The Chinese business community and commodity market in this city were quite disturbed this morning (the 5th).

Shanghai-made Products Transported Internally via this Route

In recent months, goods shipped to supply the sea manufacturing industry have arrived in Kowloon in large quantities, transferred to several places along the coast northeast of Kowloon, and then transported via rivers and land through Huizhou to Shaoguan, the temporary provincial capital of Guangdong. Many of the goods transported on this Free China transportation line are Shanghai-made brocade gauze, cloth, cigarettes, canned food, metal hardware, etc. The cotton market in this city has recently been booming, partly because cotton goods from this city can be transported to Free China via this route.

Foreign Goods Transported in Have Also Increased Sharply Recently

In recent months, the number of foreign goods transported into Kowloon has also increased sharply. It is heard that imports from Kowloon account for 11% of the entire Chinese population, and most of the imports are transported into Free China. Since September of last year, the population of Kowloon has increased dramatically. The British authorities in Hong Kong are still complying with the agreement signed with the Japanese side last summer, prohibiting military equipment, munitions, automobiles, and mineral oil from being transferred into Free China via Hong Kong and Kowloon. Therefore, only strictly peacetime goods can be transferred. However, the Japanese military action yesterday clearly intends to cut off this trade route as well.

### Shanghai-Pingjin Postal Remittances Limited to 20 Yuan

Shanghai and Pingjin postal remittances. According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Shanghai Postal Administration, the restrictions are extremely strict. The maximum amount that each person can remit is only 20 yuan. In addition to collecting a remittance fee of 1/1000 per yuan, an additional water supplement fee of 25 cents must be paid per yuan. Therefore, the amount of remittances between Shanghai and Pingjin is very small.

### Arson at the Taxpayers' Meeting Venue; Two Japanese Nationals Arrested; Japanese Side Claims Thorough Interrogation Underway; Japanese Consulate to Press Appropriate Charges

The "North-China Daily News" reports that in the early morning of the 1st of this week, two Japanese nationals broke into the Racecourse with the intention of setting fire to the mat shed built for the Special Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers, but failed. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Consulate General has taken swift action to dispel any misunderstandings that may have arisen. A statement was issued yesterday (the 4th) at 7:00 PM, announcing the arrest of the two Japanese nationals and their thorough interrogation. The statement is as follows:

Japanese Police Station Conducting Thorough Interrogation

"Japanese nationals Morinaga Matsunosuke (40 years old, unemployed) and Kubo Moriaki (22 years old, employed by the International Transportation Company) attempted to set fire to the mat shed at the Special Meeting of Taxpayers venue inside the Racecourse at 2:00 AM on February 3rd. Afterward, the two men attempted to enter the Japanese military defense zone in West Shanghai but were detained by Japanese military sentries and handed over to the West District Japanese Military Police for questioning. In the afternoon of the same day, the two men were transferred to the Japanese Consulate Police Station and are undergoing thorough interrogation.

Out-of-Bounds Behavior Has a Bad Influence

If, after interrogation, the Japanese side finds the two men guilty, they will be severely punished for the sake of public safety. The actions of some irresponsible individuals have had a negative impact on the majority of Japanese expatriates in Shanghai who are striving to maintain their reputation as peaceful citizens. Therefore, the authorities have decided to adopt stricter measures to maintain order.

To Be Tried by the Japanese Consular Court

Furthermore, the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the Japanese Consulate Police Station will continue to detain Morinaga Matsunosuke and Kubo Moriaki this morning (the 5th) to investigate their attempted arson. Yesterday afternoon, the two Japanese nationals were taken back to the Racecourse in the presence of representatives from the Japanese Consulate Police and the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) Criminal Investigation Department to reenact the arson. The details of the Japanese police station's investigation into this case are unknown, but it is heard that the Japanese Consular Court in this city may soon open a trial, accusing the two men of burning a Tairee taxi and shooting at it while attempting arson.

Japanese Expatriates Form a Committee for the Lin Case

Furthermore, Japanese newspapers in this city reported today that the Japanese community will organize a "Lin Committee" to handle all matters related to Lin Yuxiongji. The first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow (the 6th) afternoon at the Japanese General Association on Peng Road. It is said that Mr. Lin is the chairman of the Japanese Taxpayers Association,

### Robbery of a Public Bus at the Intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road; Impersonating Passengers, Suddenly Revealing Ferocious Faces, Robbing All Passengers on Board Without Exception

Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, a No. 14 bus belonging to a British public transportation company was traveling from west to east, passing through the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road. Three passengers on the bus suddenly turned into robbers. One robber took out a gun and threatened the approximately 30 passengers on board, forbidding them from making any noise. The other two robbers then began searching the passengers for valuables. The passengers, seeing the gun, did not dare to resist and had to let them do as they pleased. In the end, the robbers took all the belongings of the 30-plus passengers. It is reported that five passengers suffered particularly large losses. When the bus arrived at the Race Course Road and Maohuo Road stop, the three robbers got off one after another and swaggered away.

Yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, ten robbers, four of whom were armed with guns, broke into No. 3, Lane 128, Chengdu Road. They robbed the place, taking away 700 yuan in legal tender and disappeared without a trace.

Yesterday evening at 8:30 PM, a man was walking near Jiaozhou Road in West Shanghai when he was suddenly confronted by three robbers. They held guns and forbade him from making any noise, stripping him of his overcoat and fur robe, worth over 100 yuan in total.

Yesterday afternoon at 4:10 PM, four robbers suddenly entered the Feili Watch Shop at No. 406 Avenue Joffre, French Concession, which was opened by a local, Pan Mingjian. One of them had a gun and robbed four ladies' platinum watches worth 450 yuan, as well as 25 yuan in cash, carrying the loot away without a trace.

The day before yesterday (the 4th), at 6:30 PM, four robbers, three of whom were armed with guns, broke into the house of Che Ma Shi (20 years old), a Wuxi woman, at No. 116, Shanzhong Road, French Concession. After threatening them with guns, they immediately began robbing, taking two diamond rings with four diamonds, a gold bracelet, a gold watch, a gold chain, and 450 yuan in cash, worth over 10,000 yuan in total. They burst out of the door and fled without a trace.

Yesterday morning at 8:15 AM, the family of Mr. Li at No. 1, Lane 476, Kangti Road, was suddenly visited by four robbers who robbed the place with guns. As a result, over 400 yuan in cash was robbed and the robbers fled.

Xiang Songchu, an apprentice at a certain machine factory at No. 43, Taoyuanfang, North Henan Road, was instructed by the factory on January 23 at 5:40 PM to withdraw 1,100 yuan from the Xiangtai Money Exchange on the same road. While returning to the factory with the money, he was hugged by Dai Jinhong, a Shaoxing robber, who snatched the legal tender and attempted to escape. Xiang Songchu shouted "Robber!" As a result, he was arrested, and the stolen money was also handed over to the Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang came to the court to continue the trial. Police lawyer Jiang Baokang requested severe punishment. Dai Jinhong was sentenced to two years in prison as a warning.

### The Case of Killing a Cousin; The Murderer Confesses the Process; Lin Wei Was Chopped Dozens of Times, a Tragic Sight; Qiu Xiangbiao's Gambling Addiction Led to This Disaster

Qiu Xiangbiao, a native of Ningbo, is 24 years old and lives at No. 16, Siwen Lane, No. 553, Datong Road. At around 7:00 AM the morning before yesterday, Qiu suddenly took a kitchen knife and chopped his cousin, Lin Wei (25 years old, from Ningbo), who lived with him, without asking any questions. He chopped at him continuously over fifty times. At that time, Lin was fast asleep and not awake, so he had no resistance. It was like chopping a pig in a butcher shop, and most of the knife wounds were on the head. His face was blurred and his ears were also cut off. The cruelty of his methods is imaginable. The murderer was arrested on the spot, and the injured person was taken to Baolong Hospital, but treatment was ineffective.

Died Not Long After

The body was sent to the mortuary for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station escorted Mai Xiangbiao along with a kitchen knife to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for homicide under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and stated the facts of the case, saying that the deceased Lin Wei and the defendant Qiu Xiangbiao were both street runners for a certain savings association and lived together at No. 16, Siwen Lane, Datong Road. A year and a half ago, the defendant was fired for embezzling public funds. On December 26th last year, the deceased gave the defendant a check for 150 yuan, telling him to cash it. Unexpectedly, after the defendant got the money, he

Swallowed It All

and used it all in the harmful gambling dens. As a result, the two sides had a quarrel. On the 1st of this month, the defendant stole the deceased's overcoat and pawned it. He did not return home that night. The next morning when he returned home, another quarrel broke out. The defendant, far from knowing repentance, became angry out of shame and bore a grudge in his heart. At around 7:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, he took a kitchen knife and broke into the deceased's bedroom, violently chopping him while he was asleep, about fifty times, mostly on the head and face, causing his face to be blurred and his ears to be cut off. When his housemate Xu Haoquan heard the alarm and entered the room, the defendant had already jumped out of the window. Xu also chased him out but unfortunately fell and was injured. The defendant then fled into No. 638, Xinza Road, where he was seen by detectives Lu Jinhua and Yang Jinbao, who, seeing that he was

Splattered with Blood

and had an injured left hand, determined that he was not a good person and joined forces with the Si Ge Bu (Sikh watchmen) at No. 1601 to arrest the defendant. Since the deceased's body is still awaiting an autopsy, he requested permission to reschedule. The defendant confessed that he and the deceased had been classmates since childhood and were cousins. The night before last, when I returned home from outside, the deceased beat me for no reason and threatened to tell all my friends and relatives about my bad deeds, making it impossible for me to gain a foothold. In anger, I committed this crime, but at that time my nerves were numb and I didn't know how many times I had chopped him, etc. Judge Zhong instructed Qiu to be detained and rescheduled for seven days to be reviewed again.

Hawkins Operates a Gambling Den; Chauffeur Testifies in Court

The English Shanghai Consular Police Court continued to hear this morning (the 5th) the Shanghai Municipal Police's case against British expatriate Hawkins for operating a gambling den. Police lawyer William called a Chinese chauffeur to testify. The chauffeur stated that his name was Chuan A Gui (transliteration). His cousin Kai (transliteration) drove a car, and his father was Ren Wenyuan, who jointly set up a gambling den with O. Hawkins. He drove Ren Qi to No. 204, 2B Xikang Road for nine consecutive days, and heard Ren say that his father and Hawkins had jointly set up a gambling den there. The gambling den was then moved to the Cangzhou Hotel and continued to operate. He also served there, counting chips. The gambling den was entirely managed by Hawkins, etc. Detective Qier continued to describe how he and other police officers raided the gambling den at the Cangzhou Hotel, seized gambling equipment, and arrested 16 Chinese people, as well as the process of arresting the defendant in the French Concession. Hawkins stood up and argued that he had invited friends to eat there and that the place was not open to the public, etc. The case is scheduled to be decided at 3:30 PM today.

### Three Robbers Who Robbed the Sika Patrolman of His Gun Are Arrested One After Another; A Female Robber Specializes in Transporting Firearms

At around 11:00 PM the night before last, the Sika patrolman at the entrance of Guangde Lane on Rue Wagner, French Concession, was suddenly robbed of his official handgun by four robbers, and the patrolman was locked in the guard booth. At that time, the patrolman broke out of the door, bravely pursued them, and blew the police whistle wildly. When he chased them to Rue Lemaire, one of the robbers panicked and threw away the stolen handgun, which still had four bullets in it. The robber was immediately arrested. After being taken to the police station for interrogation, the robber confessed the whereabouts of his accomplices.

### British Women Soldiers

— Zhi Hui

From the beginning of the European War, British senior military officials have felt the importance of women's participation in the workforce. Therefore, regardless of their social class, British women between the ages of eighteen and fifty, from high-ranking officials and nobles to those in the slums, have been incorporated into various wartime organizations. Currently, the number of enlisted personnel has reached three million, accounting for one in every four British female citizens.

The female soldiers' attire, except for the trousers, is entirely the same as the soldiers' uniforms. They are assigned to serve in the army, navy, and air force, resulting in slight variations in the uniforms of each regiment and team. A total of 36,000 people serve in the local military regiments, and their uniforms are khaki. There are 25,000 people in the Air Force Auxiliary, and their uniforms are sky blue. As for the 3,000 female reservists of the Royal Navy, they wear the same blue uniforms as the navy. Their caps naturally make their hairstyles simpler, but these female soldiers have also requested a mobile hairdressing team, and the authorities have allowed them to wear moderate makeup.

Queen Elizabeth is the commander-in-chief of British women's wartime service personnel. The Princess is merely a female soldier. The Duchess of Gloucester serves as the commander of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, and the Duchess of Kent serves as the commander and nurse of the Naval Women's Reserve. Diana Churchill, the daughter of the current Prime Minister, is a member of the Naval Reserve. Another figure, Lady Cowdray, has more than two thousand hours of experience in the air, and the Air Transport Auxiliary is naturally under her command. The task of this unit is to transport new aircraft from the factories to the base. This unit also includes air raid inspectors, whose mission is to detect enemy aircraft movements before they reach their destinations.

Most women serve as clerks, typists, telephone operators, manage radio communications, cook, and drive vehicles, etc. Although they are assigned to various locations and reside in military camps, there is also a headquarters in London. Their discipline is extremely strict. Married women, unless they have given birth to children and become mothers, are not allowed to leave their posts without permission. They consider the strict curfew regulations in the camp at night unnecessary because their service is upright and aboveboard, without any ambiguity.

Since the large-scale air raids by the Germans began last summer, women serving have occupied an extremely important position in this war. Under the jurisdiction of the Air Force, there are 15,000 drivers, 200,000 nurses, 120,000 air observation posts, 6,500 Air Force catering managers, and 13,000 auxiliary firefighters. In London, there are also 250 river police officers dedicated to ensuring the safety of ships transporting wounded soldiers on the River Thames.

The largest women's group is the Women's Voluntary Service, with members throughout the British Isles. There are 750,000 registered members, led by the Marchioness of Reading, with the deputy commander being the wife of Montagu Norman, who has been the Governor of the Bank of England for twenty-two consecutive years. Their main task includes all departments of wartime work, with their specific responsibility being to rescue and evacuate millions of homeless women and children from war zones to safe areas.

British women have also replaced part of the male workforce in farms and factories. Thirty-five thousand adult women have taken up hoes and gone to work in the fields. They also wear uniforms: khaki shirts, shorts, and green tops. "The farmland is the battlefield, turning the rear into the front," is their slogan. There are even more adult women serving in wartime factories, currently reaching 700,000.

In the near future, the British women's organization is likely to expand and strengthen further because they will soon receive the support of an allied force. French women residing in the UK, aged eighteen to forty-five, are actively reorganizing a large group to concentrate under the command of General de Gaulle, the leader of "Free France." Their former commander was Madame Mathieu, known worldwide as the Queen of Tennis.

The Surprise of Fish—Written by Chen Qi

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

The matter of electing a representative is indeed a very thorny issue. Firstly, because the Girls' Normal School, under Principal Hou's saintly and strict guardianship for several years, has almost created a nunnery-like atmosphere—dry, quiet, and calm... no one dares to speak loudly, and no one dares to walk with big strides. Laughter is almost completely forbidden at school; crying is acceptable. In this environment, even a born orator would degenerate to the point of stuttering. Therefore, the selection of a representative is greatly difficult. Secondly, most humans are competitive, especially women. A student who does not have the eloquence or courage to be a representative certainly does not want others to have this eloquence or courage at the same time. Although she cannot surpass others herself, she does not want others to be able to surpass her either. Therefore, during the voting, she deliberately selects people who are inferior to herself to be elected, making it impossible for them to accept, thus僵拼the matter.

Until the day before the meeting was adjourned, a representative had not yet been produced. Principal Hou became anxious. Knowing that "democratic politics" had failed, she decisively changed her strategy, took a list of this year's graduates, and without hesitation, marked the first person's name with a red pen, thus designating her as the representative to deliver the thank-you speech.

In less than half an hour, Luo Xiangqi's name was being repeated on the lips of every student in the school.

"Isn't Luo Xiangqi the person who ranked first in the fourth grade?" A new student in the first grade, like recalling a "great figure" in history, raised her head and looked at the wall with half-closed eyes, asking the two third-grade students in her room.

The people being asked nodded at the same time. "Is she pretty?"

"Not unlikable, but her figure is too tall, and the corners of her eyes are a little upturned, so she doesn't look very gentle," the first third-grade student criticized harshly. (Two Three)

Family

### Prisoner Without a Crime

— Zi Fang

Life is about expression, but it also requires restraint; however, an overly restrained life will cause people to suffer great pain and disaster.

Unfortunately, I am an overly restrained person. Since I was a child, I have been a prisoner without a crime, confined in the prison of my family, unable to cross the line! I did not have the freedom of running, playing, and other actions, nor did I have the freedom of will and emotional expression: I could not cry or make noise, nor could I laugh; I could not talk too much, nor could I speak loudly. Scolding, dislike, and sarcasm cultivated my habit of self-restraint; fear, shyness, and humility controlled my entire emotions. I dared not be happy, dared not be angry, and dared not be sad. My childhood was like this, languidly and foolishly, without a bit of childishness and liveliness.

Because the pressure of the environment remained constant, the habit of self-restraint deepened with age. Since almost every motive was met with resistance and every hope was met with disappointment, I dared not love or desire anything. I didn't even dare to move or speak casually. Life was dominated everywhere, without a bit of self-expression. Youth is active, but my youth is not as good as other people's old age!

But my misfortune does not stop there. A restrained life not only affected my mental health but also eroded my physical health: my feet developed a chronic disease due to the lack of exercise opportunities, eventually losing the ability to move and becoming disabled; my eyes suffered vision loss due to the lack of opportunities to see far; my nerves weakened due to the constant suffering of depression. So, in addition to the environment and self-restraint, there was also health restraint: I not only gave up the idea of ​​"breaking out of prison," but I couldn't even move in prison; I could have found some comfort in books, but from then on, I couldn't read often due to eye disease and neurasthenia. Under the triple restraint of environment, self, and health, my living space shrank to the point where I could hardly breathe!

At present, the extreme expression of self-restraint is the difficulty in speaking. Often, I cannot think of even very ordinary words to say right away. I always have to hesitate and consider repeatedly whether the words can be said and whether they need to be said before I say them. If what I want to say is a request, opinion, or rebuttal, then I will be subject to even greater subconscious resistance such as fear and self-pity. I want to say it but end up not being willing to say it. I must use intelligence to apply pressure repeatedly before I can barely blurt out a few sentences; sometimes, I miss the opportunity because of this and regret it later. So, speaking is also a laborious and annoying thing for me. Try to imagine if speaking becomes difficult, what else is easy? Restraint, difficulty! The whole life is in restraint and difficulty!

Life tells me: A restrained life is the most cruel life, the most painful life! (Royalties are donated to the children's library)

### Indian Dance Makes Its Debut

— Min

Indian Star Lila Will Showcase Her Skills at the Lyceum Theatre

The Shanghai newspaper was the first to report the news of Indian star Lila's arrival in Shanghai. She was on her way to Hollywood and was passing through Shanghai. Initially, she only wanted to set foot in Shanghai, like people from various countries visiting China, to take a quick look around Shanghai. But upon arriving in Shanghai, she met several friends in the film and theater industry. Lila is a star on the Indian stage. Now that she has met fellow friends, she naturally couldn't help but have the intention of visiting Chinese films and dramas. Therefore, from "setting foot," she transitioned to "staying a little longer." Last month, she moved out of the hostel and into a foreign apartment on Avenue Saipo.

The first company she visited was Min Hua Film Company because the name "Confucius" has different legends in various countries. She knew that Min Hua had spent great effort in producing this biographical film, so she first visited Mr. Fei Mu. She watched the test screening of "Confucius" in the Min Hua screening room. At the same time, she also felt a great interest in the currently produced film "Ancient Chinese Songs".

It is said that she also watched "Home" at the Lafayette Theatre. I wonder if she has any opinions to express about Chinese stage plays?

This year during the "New Year", she went to the New Stage to see Zhang Yipeng's half-act play. She expressed surprise at the art of the "Monkey King". She thought that Chinese Peking Opera was represented by Mei Lanfang, so in her imagination, Chinese Peking Opera was all about men dressing up as women. At the same time, Zhang Yipeng's performance this time greatly improved the set design, lighting, costumes, and dubbing. This new posture made a foreigner feel even more surprised.

As she lived there for a longer period and got to know more Chinese friends, under the instigation of various parties, she will also present her classical art—various Indian dances. According to reliable sources, she has already contacted the Lyceum Theatre and has scheduled performances on the nights of the nineteenth and twenty-third of next month.

We have indeed seen white people perform Indian dances in Hollywood movies, but introducing "authentic" Indian art to the Shanghai audience is still a first.

After Lila's performance, she will pass through Japan and Manila to reach Hollywood. It has not yet been decided which company she will join in the film city. I think Hollywood magazines will tell us about her whereabouts in the future.

### Paul Muni Opposes the "Star System"

— Bao Xing

Striving to Improve the Film Industry and Atmosphere

Since the completion of "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," Paul Muni has been away from Hollywood on a tour in the southern United States; and he took the opportunity to investigate the situation of stage plays there. He was so reluctant to leave until the end of last year when he finally returned to Hollywood via Washington and Chicago.

After arriving in Hollywood, Paul seemed a bit discouraged. He did not attend the social gatherings he had been away from for a long time, and he was very afraid of meeting newspaper reporters and photographers; the reason is this: After the completion of "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," he had revealed some dissatisfaction with Warner Bros.' treatment of him, and he intended to withdraw from the screen and devote himself to a stage career.

However, Paul Muni, after returning to Hollywood, has already thought of a compromise solution, which is: to formally announce his withdrawal from the Warner Bros. lineup and join 20th Century Fox, and he decided to work hard (including stage work) to realize his ideal of improving the film industry and atmosphere.

Is the atmosphere of Hollywood's film industry really terrible? Yes, please listen to what Paul Muni said to the reporters at the 20th Century Fox studio when he went to shoot his new film "Hudson's Bay": "...Hollywood? It is really a boil. Supporting actors have no hope of advancement, and extras can't get enough to eat... All of this is caused by the star system here, this system has strangled many artistic geniuses... My hope is that everyone is equal... Although I am dissatisfied with Hollywood now, I welcome the Hollywood of the future..."

Paul has a singing scene in the new film, which is the first time he has sung in his life.

### Watching the Cantonese Opera "Chu-Han Contention" at "Wing On"

— Tun

The Wing On Troupe is organized by the staff of Wing On Company. Recently, they performed the Cantonese opera "Chu-Han Contention" at the Great Eastern Hotel. "Chu-Han Contention" was adapted into a Cantonese opera by Mai Youyun. The theme is correct, realistic, and grasps the anti-tyranny martial arts theme. The performance was also quite wonderful.

Among all the actors, Guo Lingshuang was the most outstanding. In the whole play, he can be said to be the most hardworking and successful one. He played Xiang Yu, which suited his personality. His posture was stable, his movements were well-formed, his voice was loud, and his tune was novel. The "Overlord's Tune" that he used suddenly rose from a low pitch, and each word fell out, wide and not scattered, tight and not hurried, which could not be done without sufficient internal strength. When bidding farewell to his concubine and committing suicide, his voice and appearance were both excellent, generous and tragic, truly showing his skills. Zhong Fenghua's Yu Ji was both strong and graceful. In the sword dance scene, her swordsmanship was skilled. When separating from Xiang Yu, her singing was like weeping and complaining, full of sorrow and grief, with each word a tear, touching people's hearts. Tang Guanpeng's Fan Zeng had a beautiful stage presence, and his singing was also concise. His slow tempo song was sung in a steady and stable manner. Liang Yimin's Liu Bang had stable and seasoned singing and acting. When playing the Chu soldier, his dialogue was clever and full of wit. Every other actor was able to perform their duties steadily.

The atmosphere at the time was quite lively. When leaving the venue, this reporter spoke with the company's president, Mr. Liu Shengchu, and he informed me that this play was only recently written. Coupled with the busy end-of-year business, the rehearsal time was very short. Given these circumstances, it is indeed not easy to achieve this result.
