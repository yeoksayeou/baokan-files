### Relations with Germany Will Eventually Rupture; The United States Prepares for War at Any Moment; Border Patrol and Customs Officials Begin Alert to Prevent 330,000 German Immigrants from Fleeing

Reuters, Washington, 18th – Based on all information gathered here, a rupture between the US and Germany is possible at any moment. The US is now prepared for war. It is rumored that Germany itself wants to provoke a conflict with the US. Therefore, the destruction of the American cargo ship Robin Moor was premeditated by Germany to undermine American neutrality, believing that (1) if the US joins the war, all American ships would become targets for German submarines and raiding ships; (2) in any case, the US would not be able to send troops to Europe in the short term; (3) even if the US immediately joins the war, the aid Britain receives from the US may not be more than when the US remains neutral; (4) Japan, as a member of the Axis, is active in the Pacific and can restrain a large part of the American fleet; (5) Japan's participation in the war on the Axis side is expected. News from Berlin indicates that Germans are no longer adhering to the position of "we will not be angry even if provoked," which observers here do not find surprising, as they know that Germany's retaliatory actions for closing consulates may be severe and could lead to a final rupture in US-German relations.

Reuters, Washington, 18th – US border patrol and customs officials were put on alert last night to prevent the 330,000 German immigrants in the US from leaving the country without orders. According to an official, this restriction will give the government the opportunity to control the movement of German immigrants into Mexico or South America, where there is said to be a lot of pro-Axis activity. President Roosevelt recently told visiting reporters that the activities of German consulates prompted him to issue the expulsion order, which contained subversive elements. President Roosevelt refused to directly answer questions about whether the German consuls were involved in espionage or sabotage, saying that what he meant by subversive elements included many crimes. A reporter said that it was rumored that consuls from countries other than Germany were engaged in suspicious activities. President Roosevelt replied with a subtle attitude, saying that he had not received this information today, leading to speculation that the US might begin to expel consuls from other countries.

Reuters, New York, 18th – According to reliable sources, the US will impose strict controls on those entering the US before July 1st

### St. Lawrence River of Great Value; Secretary of War Stimson Says Completion Will Take Four Years

Reuters, Washington, 18th – Secretary of War Stimson told the House Appropriations Committee yesterday that the war would not end in a short time and may drag on for four years or more. The proposed St. Lawrence Seaway project, which will take four years to complete, can protect part of the shipping route for sending arms to Britain. In his view, it is necessary to prepare for a long war. We all hope that the war will be shortened, but it is not safe to deal with the current situation based on this hope. There is a good chance that the war will be prolonged, allowing the United States to reap the benefits of this waterway. Representatives from the Departments of State, War, Justice, Commerce, and Immigration have formed a committee to plan [to] prevent subversive activities by spies from other governments.

Germany Protests Closure of Consulates and Will Freeze American Funds

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 18th – The German government has protested the US closure of German consulates, railway offices, Haitong News Agency, and the information department of the library. The full text is as follows: The US government presented a note to the German Chargé d'Affaires in the US on June 16th, requesting that the German consuls in the US, the staff of the German Library Information Office in New York, Haitong News Agency, and the German Railway Office leave the US because they were engaged in unacceptable activities. The German government rejects this accusation, considering it an unfounded and arbitrary action, and lodges a strong protest against this violation of the agreement.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 18th – A German Foreign Ministry spokesman stated today that the German government does not consider the case regarding Germany's protest against the US closure of German consulates to be resolved.

United Press, Berlin, 18th – The German government retaliated against the US action yesterday, ordering that "necessary measures" be taken against the property of American citizens in Germany. The government did not announce what form this measure would take, and authoritative sources did not answer any questions. Some observers believe that the content of the actions the German government will take has not yet been drafted, so announcing that "necessary measures" will be taken will let the world know that Germany will retaliate against the US freezing of funds and closing of consulates. According to neutral and non-official estimates, American industries in Germany are worth a total of 450 million US dollars, and there is also a large amount of American property in German-occupied countries, especially in France.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 18th – The German government announced yesterday that after the US president ordered the freezing of German citizens' funds in the US, the German government would also take all necessary measures against the funds of American citizens in Germany. Responsible officials have not yet announced the nature of these measures, but the main one is also the freezing of funds.

Roman Government Officially Announces Six Measures to Retaliate Against the United States

United Press, Rome, 18th – The Italian Fascist government officially announced six measures to retaliate against the United States: issuing a decree to prohibit all Italian and foreign people from repaying debts owed to American people within Italian territory, and prohibiting the transfer of any property to Americans as collateral. This does not apply to American people permanently residing in Italy. It also prohibits Americans from disposing of or selling all property, real estate, stocks, bonds, and deposits in Italy. Italian people must report all debts owed to Americans and their holdings of American stocks or property to the Bank of Italy within twenty days. In special circumstances, the Italian government may approve the repayment of this debt if necessary. Those who violate the regulations by privately repaying debts or transferring property or stocks to Americans will be sentenced to three years in prison and fined five times the original amount, but the fine shall not be less than 10,000 Italian lire. Accomplices will be sentenced to six months in prison and fined 3,000 lire. Those who have American property, stocks, and debts and fail to report them to the Bank of Italy will be sentenced to three months in prison and fined 3,000 lire. Those who make inaccurate reports will be sentenced to six months in prison and fined 6,000 lire.

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 18th – According to the Italian News Agency, Italy can calmly deal with the US economic war against the Axis powers and the freezing of German and Italian funds. Comparing the total amount of mutual investment between the US and Italy, Italy is actually more advantageous. The US has invested a total of 145,000,000 US dollars in Italy, while Italian funds in the US are only 63,000,000 US dollars, of which 52,000,000 US dollars are investments, 1,000,000 US dollars are the value of inventory, and 10,000,000 US dollars are the value of confiscated ships.

Haitong News Agency, Swiss Capital, 18th – As a result of the recent US Treasury Department's freezing of European countries' funds in the US, no less than 600 million Swiss francs of Swiss funds in the US have been frozen.

The Swiss National Bank currently has one representative stationed in the United States.

Latin American Countries Will Issue Joint Declaration; Uruguayan Government Proposes Jointly Helping the United States Defend the Western Hemisphere

Tass News Agency, New York, 18th – According to the Associated Press, the Uruguayan Foreign Minister said that Uruguay has discussed with representatives of various Latin American countries the development of a common declaration. According to the declaration, if any American country goes to war with a non-American power, other American countries will regard it as a non-belligerent. If Latin American countries reject Uruguay's proposal, Uruguay will issue a declaration alone. According to the New York Times, if the United States enters the war, Uruguay will allow the United States to use its naval base. Currently, Argentina opposes the United States using its base, but this attitude is not valued by Uruguay. The governments of Costa Rica and Guatemala in Central America will allow the United States to use their railways to defend the Western Hemisphere.

Havas Agency, Uruguayan Capital, 17th – Two years ago, the American countries passed a declaration of solidarity at the Lima Pan-American Conference. The Uruguayan Foreign Minister is currently studying an amendment, the content of which is to advocate that if any American country interferes in an international war, other countries in the Western Hemisphere should treat it as a non-belligerent. If this proposal is established, then once the United States enters the war, its warships will be able to enter Uruguayan ports.

Although Welles did not indicate what action the United States would take, it is expected that at least a strong protest will be lodged.

Editorial

### The Tripartite Pact and the United States

Geographically, the United States is situated between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, so its maritime defense plan must take both oceans into account to avoid neglecting one at the expense of the other. At the same time, this is the theoretical basis for the Tripartite Pact to contain the United States. Recently, relations between the US and Germany have deteriorated sharply. After the Robin Moor incident and the US freezing of German and Italian funds and expelling German consuls, diplomatic relations are hanging by a thread, and the prospect of joining the war is just around the corner. On the other hand, the situation in the Far East is also tense. Although there are no signs that Japan will take immediate action after the breakdown of negotiations with the Dutch East Indies, it is conceivable that Japan will not easily let go of this opportunity to exploit the deteriorating US-German relations to coerce the United States. Recently, there have been many rumors and conflicting views about US-Japan relations, which shows that it is an extremely subtle and complex problem.

Whether Japan is determined to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Tripartite Pact is still a mystery subject to much speculation. On the Japanese side, declarations of loyalty to the Pact are common, and views advocating that Japan should not blindly follow Germany and Italy are also frequently heard. In fact, this question, even for the Japanese authorities, may depend on the specific situation in the future, and they may not want to be rigidly bound by the terms of the Pact. However, the correct view should still focus on the fact that the Tripartite Pact does exist as a formal treaty, and other intentions are only possible. If one places illusions on Japan's possible evasion of the Pact, it is sufficient to make the Pact form a powerful weapon for Japan to hold hostage democratic countries that are at war or about to be at war. At the beginning of the European war, Britain and France tried their best to keep Italy in a non-belligerent position, and Germany was also happy to use Italy's position to open a leak in the British and French blockade. As a result, it maintained a neutral observer status for more than half a year, and its final outcome was nothing more than creating an opportunity to stab France in the back when it was in crisis. That mistake should not be repeated in the Pacific.

Since the United States issued a tough ultimatum to Japan at the end of 1938, it has continuously exerted increasing pressure on Japan. Japan, apart from annoyance and resentment, has never taken retaliatory action, and has not even applied the kind of anti-British movement it launched against Britain in 1939 to the United States. This is not because Japan favors the United States, but because there are major concerns about the United States. First, the US Far East policy is firm, consistent, and clear, and unlike the British side's past excessive emphasis on strategy, it is not easy to threaten it. Second, in economic relations, Japan is deeply dependent on the United States. Commercial relations with and resource imports from the United States are vital to Japan. Even the Japanese yen is linked to the US dollar. Before the completion of the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" plan, cutting off this economic connection will be the most serious blow to Japan. Third, the condemnation and pressure exerted by the United States on Japan are not isolated applications, but are accompanied by the strengthening of armaments in the Pacific. Recently, although the defenses of the Philippines, Guam, and the Aleutian Islands have not reached the ideal state, they are no longer as weak and vulnerable as they were two years ago. Moreover, the US's new sharp air force and main fleet have always been concentrated in the Pacific, especially Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. In the Atlantic, only a garrison fleet is stationed, including three older battleships and some cruisers and destroyers. At present, the US's three-ocean navy has not been completed, but the strength of its Pacific Fleet alone, according to Japanese estimates, is also considered to be one-third stronger than the entire Japanese navy. This is something that Japan cannot but carefully consider. In addition, China's persistent warfare and US support for China naturally also restrain the largest part of Japan's strength.

However, once war breaks out between the US and Germany, the above factors will lose or reduce their ability to restrain Japan. At that time, Japan will disregard everything about the US and openly fulfill its treaty obligations to the Axis powers, replacing the US economically with the Asian continent and Southeast Asia. However, the war against China and the US's superior navy are still Japan's biggest difficulties. There have been several resolute attempts to "end the China Incident" in the past, and perhaps they will be actively pursued again recently. The result is predictable to be no different from the past. Thus, wanting to fight the United States at the same time is a major difficulty. On the US side, even if joining the war is realized, its new large battleships, such as the recently completed ships like the Gazzelina and the Danata, have no room for use in the Atlantic. Only a portion of its large destroyers are divided to cooperate with the British navy, which still holds maritime hegemony, and this is enough to cope with the threat of German submarines, and it will not affect its absolute naval strength advantage in the Pacific. Given the disparity in economic strength between the US and Japan, the later the time, the more the US naval strength will not be attainable by Japan. In the past, during the US's ten-year naval construction hiatus, the Japanese navy did not have the certainty of victory, let alone now that the US's shipbuilding plan has been catching up rapidly while Japan is trapped in a long and arduous war against China?

Putting aside strategic and technical issues, just based on the comparison of naval strength, although the Tripartite Pact seems formidable, it is not actually seen to have a real effect on containing the United States.

### Exchange of Notes on Sino-Burmese Boundary Demarcation Held Yesterday in Chongqing; Detailed Provisions on the Yunnan-Burma Border Line; Burma Agrees to Chinese Participation in Mining Enterprises

Chongqing - The exchange of notes between the Chinese and British governments regarding the demarcation of the Sino-Burmese border was held here at 5:00 PM today. One of the documents details the border line between Yunnan Province and Burma, while another specifies the border line in a certain area of Burma. The Burmese government has agreed to Chinese participation in any mining enterprises, either independently or under British company management. In 1885, Britain annexed Burma. According to Article 3 of the Sino-British treaty of 1886 concerning Burma and Tibet, the Sino-Burmese border was to be surveyed and demarcated by a Boundary Commission. Negotiations began in 1892, and a treaty was signed on March 1, 1894, stipulating the boundary. This was subsequently amended by an agreement made in 1897. However, due to imprecise terminology used in the agreement, considerable difficulties were encountered. On April 9, 1935, the Chinese, British, and Indian sides exchanged notes in Nanjing, agreeing to establish a committee, chaired by a neutral country commissioner appointed by the League of Nations, to submit reports and recommendations. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the matter was again shelved. The issue became acute once again after the Chinese government decided to accelerate the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, as the easiest route would traverse the disputed area. Coupled with the increasing atmosphere of goodwill between China and Britain, the matter was quickly resolved. All resolutions will be listed in today afternoon's exchange of notes. (Reuters, 18th)

### Government Decides to Purchase Large Quantities of Rice

Chongqing - Reliable sources say that the Chinese government has decided to import large quantities of rice from abroad. This is the government's first such decision since the war began. This measure is extremely important, as the southern ports of Free China, which were previously used to import rice from Southeast Asia, have been cut off. The area behind Shantou in Guangdong Province is already facing famine due to shortages. Now, the government can transport rice to this area via the interior. Well-informed sources say that funds have been allocated to purchase rice from rice-producing areas. The food administration is preparing hundreds of vehicles specifically for transporting this rice to the interior of China. In addition, the government plans to transport rice from rice-abundant areas to areas in need. (United Press, 18th)

Chongqing - 50,000 piculs of rice arrived from Hunan today, so the food shortage problem here is expected to be resolved. According to authorities, Hunan Province will supply Chongqing with 900,000 piculs of rice within a year to lower rice prices. Therefore, in addition to the 50,000 piculs that arrived today, another 850,000 piculs will arrive in succession. The best rice from the counties around Dongting Lake in Hunan Province costs 100 yuan per picul, while in Chongqing the price is around 400 yuan. Currently, the cost of shipping by both water and land, including transportation fees, is only about 150 yuan per picul, so rice prices here are expected to fall sharply soon. Recently, there has also been abundant rainfall, avoiding drought, which is another important factor in the price drop of rice. (Reuters, 18th)

### Dust Swirls on the North African Front; British and German Forces Engage in Major Battle; Both Sides' Tank Divisions Charge and Assault; Contending for the Sollum-Capuzzo Triangle

Reuters, Cairo, 18th - According to news received in Cairo last night, a tank battle of unprecedented scale occurred near the Halfaya Pass on the Egyptian-Libyan border on Sunday. During the battle, tanks and armored vehicles from both sides charged and assaulted each other in the swirling sand, counterattacking each other. The battle was extremely fierce. South of Halfaya Pass, British tanks advanced rapidly, rushed up the slopes, and attacked the triangular position between Halfaya, Sollum, and Capuzzo. This battle news has caused great excitement in Egypt, as it shows that General Wavell has sufficient strength to fight on two fronts simultaneously. Military equipment and supplies have been flowing in from Britain, the United States, India, and Australia for many months, and must now have reached a truly adequate level.

Reuters, Cairo, 18th - British forces have driven German-Italian troops back to the Capuzzo fort. It is reported that German-Italian soldiers are still stubbornly defending Sollum, but they are in obvious danger of having their British contact cut off by the battles raging on the plateau. According to a Reuters reporter, the fighting in the triangle between Sollum, Capuzzo, and Halfaya is now developing into regular warfare. German-Italian forces are urgently transferring fresh troops from the Tobruk area as reinforcements. The trend of the war is difficult to predict. Currently, tanks, armored vehicles, and mobile artillery from both armies are competing for positions, each wanting to gain a launching point within this triangle. Whichever side holds this area will be very useful and will make things difficult for the other side. The scale of the fighting on the coastal plains near Sollum is small and cannot be compared to the real fierce battles taking place on the slopes.

Havas, Vichy, 17th - Although the weather in Africa has been hot recently, the fighting on the Libyan-Egyptian border has resumed. Two days ago, British forces launched an offensive on the Egyptian border and have already attacked the Halfaya Pass inside Libyan territory. This pass is located in Libya, with a road along the Egyptian coast leading to Marsa Matruh, making it a key military location. It was once occupied by British forces last year, but later recaptured by German-Italian allied forces. Now it has been recovered by the British again, but both sides are still fighting for it. Fighting is also occurring in the Sidi Omar area, which is 40 miles inside Libya. It is reported that British mechanized units have reached the vicinity of the Capuzzo fort. The air forces of both sides are also very active, bombing each other's rear lines and troop concentration points. British forces have bombed the Axis supply base at the port of Benghazi. Axis aircraft have also bombed the British island of Malta.

### Southern State's Territory is Divided; Britain Expresses Resolution Not to Recognize; German Foreign Ministry Publishes White Paper; States the Background of the Southern State's Coup

Reuters, London, 18th - The British government has sent a note to the Southern State's minister in Britain, stating its indignation at the forced division of the Southern State's territory, disregarding the true will of the Southern State's people. It also declares that Britain is fully aware of the Southern State's protest against the Axis powers' partition of its territory. Britain considers the actions of the German-Italian governments in recognizing Croatia as an independent state to be invalid. The British government will continue to support the government of King Peter II of the Southern State and recognizes it as the sole legitimate representative of Croatia, Slovenia, and other parts of Yugoslavia.

Reuters, London, 18th - Reuters has learned that whenever the Nazis trample on a country, they publish a White Paper. Now they have specially published a White Paper on Yugoslavia. According to Berlin, the book is based on the conspiracy of officers under General Simovic, and contains 144 documents.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 18th - The German Foreign Ministry announced yesterday its seventh White Paper, stating briefly: "After Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact, its representative was captured by General Simovic upon returning home from Vienna, and the government was overthrown. Everyone wants to know how this unprecedented event could suddenly succeed. The initial policy of Germany and Italy toward the Balkans was to preserve peace there and prevent the enemy from launching an anti-German front. Therefore, they jointly resolved the land disputes of Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania and had these three countries join the Tripartite Pact, as a basis for opposing Britain's expansion of the war to the Balkans. But in March of this year, after the Southern State decided to join the Tripartite Pact to avoid war, how could it be destroyed overnight by a group of soldiers and suffer such a disaster? The general background of the Southern State's coup can be learned from the seventh White Paper just released by the German Foreign Ministry. It contains 144 diplomatic and military documents seized from the French campaign, which provide evidence regarding the Southern State's coup, sufficient for proof. Since the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, it has strived to improve relations with Yugoslavia. Regarding economic issues, Germany's representative showed a friendly attitude. Hitler also welcomed Southern State Premier Stojadinovic in January 1938, but Stojadinovic, upon returning home, faced the same fate as Simovic and was immediately overthrown. After the war broke out, the Southern State still adopted a pro-British attitude. Documents obtained prove that Britain believed that the Salonika campaign could obtain the active assistance of the Southern State. Although the Axis powers knew this, they still hoped that the Southern State would participate in the Tripartite Pact and would not bear military obligations to the Axis powers. The White Paper contains a previously unpublished note, dated April 25, guaranteeing that the military obligations of the Tripartite Pact would not be implemented. Another document is a report from the German minister to the Southern State, stating that after the Southern State received the note, the Southern State rebels immediately expressed their willingness to join the British side in the war."

### French Forces in Syria Counterattack; Preventing British Advance; Merjayoun Still Held by Allied Forces; French Camel Corps Defends Against Tank Offensive

Reuters, Cairo, 18th - Recent news from Syria states that fighting south of Damascus is continuing. Allied forces continue to occupy many Vichy military positions in the area, and the Allied forces have also occupied the mountains overlooking the Damascus Plain, gradually pressing toward Damascus. After the Allied forces estimated Merjayoun, the situation there stabilized.

Reuters, Cairo, 18th - The resistance of Vichy forces in Syria, which was originally hoped to be avoided, has now become a reality, as General Dentz's troops have launched a counterattack in the central region, causing fighting. However, this has not caused a major change in the war situation. According to news received here last night, Merjayoun, which Vichy claimed to have recaptured, is still in the hands of the Allied forces. The war situation there is stable, and the Allied forces have sufficient reserves. Along the coast, Allied forces have crossed Sidon, making some progress. The war situation seems to be quite stable. There is still fighting south of Damascus. The general population and Muslims of Syria have shown friendly expressions toward the Allied forces.

Reuters, London, 18th - According to news received here today, the advance of Allied troops on Damascus is continuing. Positions three miles west of the city have been attacked by Allied forces. On the coastal side, it is reported that the main force of the Allied troops has advanced beyond Sidon by four miles, and patrol units have advanced a further six miles without encountering resistance. Although facing strong resistance, British and Free French forces have now advanced to a location less than twenty miles from Beirut.

United Press, Vichy, 18th - News received here yesterday from the front lines states that French air raids and the occupation of Merjayoun have slowed the British offensive along the Syrian coast. French naval and air operations have prevented the Australian army from receiving naval artillery support and have prevented it from advancing further from Sidon, which it occupied a few days ago. French High Commissioner Dentz, with his counterattack strategy, has forced the British army to slow down and consolidate its gains. Military observers say that General Wilson had fewer than 12,000 troops at the time of the offensive, and his losses to date are estimated to be over 5,000. Wilson has therefore mobilized another 10,000 troops for combat, but the number is still insufficient. One unit of General Dentz's troops, in a fierce counterattack in the south, has reached Akkara, which is almost adjacent to the Lebanese border, about forty miles from the front lines of the Trans-Jordan army. The Trans-Jordan army is currently somewhat stranded in Kiswe. After French troops reached Akkara, they were able to cut off railway traffic, but the Trans-Jordan army still holds the motorized transport line. In the vicinity of Kiswe headquarters and its southern territory, French forces have launched a local counteroffensive and expanded their positions in front of their lines. British warships did not bombard the coast again yesterday to assist the Australian army in Sidon, but the French navy continued to patrol Syrian waters with large naval aircraft. In Mesopotamia and eastern Syria, desert camel corps are defending against British tanks. The famous French Meharistes camel corps has been deployed, preparing to fight, in order to resist the British army attacking the French oil pipeline through the desert from Haifa to Kirkuk. The Meharistes camel corps excel at cavalry tactics, using camels for shock assaults. Their forward rushing distance can be as far as one hundred miles. Military observers say that camel corps fighting against tanks is an unprecedented event.

### French Minister of Aviation Arrives in Syria to Inspect the War Situation

Havas, Vichy, 17th - Minister of Aviation, Mr. Jean-François Jannekeyn, flew to Syria today to inspect the condition of the local air force. After disembarking, Mr. Jannekeyn met with High Commissioner Dentz, Commander-in-Chief of the Land Forces in the Near East, at the Near East Army Headquarters to hear about the operational situation of the air force in the Near East. According to Mr. Jannekeyn, the government is closely monitoring the war situation in the Near East.

### British and French Naval Clash; One French Ship Lost

Reuters, Vichy, 18th - It is announced here that a French destroyer has sunk off the coast of Syria during naval warfare. Vichy officials were informed yesterday by a radio message that the ship's naval personnel are missing, and their relatives have been notified.

### US and Canada Plan to Expand Economic Cooperation; Canadian Prime Minister Speaks in the US; Determined to Fully Assist Britain in the War

Reuters, Ottawa, 18th - According to a statement released last night by the Canadian Prime Minister's Office, Canada and the United States have formed a joint investigation committee to review the possibility of greater economic cooperation between the two sides. This joint investigation is further proof of the implementation of the declaration made by President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King on April 20 in the National Park.

Reuters, New York, 18th - Canadian Prime Minister King said to Canadian groups last night in New York that when the enemy is at our door and on our coast, and we all know that without freedom we are slaves, we should fight first and then calculate the cost of the war. Britain lacks Canadian currency, but we have told them not to worry about it. We are fighting for Canada, but not only for Canada, we are also fighting for Britain, for North American culture, and for humanity above all else. We should always do our best to fight. Canadians send food, raw materials and war equipment to Britain, estimated to reach 1.5 billion yuan in 1941. In addition to shipping goods into Canada, Britain needs 1 billion yuan to pay for purchases in Canada. Britain has now paid one percent of this amount in cash, and the remainder is paid by Canada in Canadian gold dollars. He predicted that one day, when the war is over, the United States and Britain will reconnect and work together on the great effort to relieve the suffering of mankind.

Reuters, Princeton, 18th - Canadian Prime Minister King recently came to the United States for a short stay. Yesterday, he accepted an honorary degree from Princeton University and said to the graduating class that Canada and the United States will always be the best of neighbors, walking side by side, because our ideas, concepts, and interests are all the same. We despise what is fleeting, and we cherish what lasts forever.

### Vichy Persecutes Jews; Building Detention Camps in North Africa

Reuters, London, 18th - The Jewish Telegraphic Agency Lisbon reports that the Vichy government is currently building a large detention camp in French North Africa that can accommodate 50,000 people. All foreign Jews in France who cannot leave France for other suitable places in a short period of time will be sent to this detention camp in North Africa. One week before the publication of the new anti-Jewish orders in France, the Vichy Ministry of the Interior had notified the provinces of measures to suppress Jews and discussed ways to eliminate large numbers of foreign Jews, causing Jews in France to be ordered to leave their homes within four days and move to the Correze region in central France, in order to be deported to North Africa. As a result, mass arrests of Jews took place in the streets of Marseilles. Some foreign Jews detained in North Africa must live in specified small French towns.

### Italian Prisoners of War Now Total Nearly 190,000

Reuters, London, 18th - According to a statement released in the House of Commons today, the number of Italians captured by British forces now reaches 188,000. In addition, there are 66,000 indigenous troops.

### France Rushes to Build Cargo Ships

Reuters, Lisbon, 18th - It has been learned here that French shipyards are building cargo ships under Nazi pressure. These cargo ships will specifically operate between France, Lisbon, and American territories. It is reported that between October of last year and February of this year, a large number of goods were transported from French overseas colonies to the unoccupied areas of France.

### British New Invention: Secret Weapon; Used to Defend Against Night Raids

Reuters, London, 18th - The British government recently released a message stating that the British have now invented a secret weapon to resist night bombers, which can detect the location of enemy aircraft by radio. Minister of State Beaverbrook has recently broadcast, calling on engineers from the British Empire and the United States to assist in the use of thousands of these new devices.

### Soviet Union Strengthens Red Army Strength, Ready to Cope with Emergencies, Holds Drills Everywhere to Maintain Armed Neutrality, Germany Plans to Conclude New Agreement with Soviet Union to Avoid Conflict

Havas News Agency, Moscow, 17th - Military figures here stated that the Soviet Red Army General Headquarters is now actively working to enhance the strength of the Red Army. This is evident from the large-scale exercises currently being held by the Red Army in various regions and the call-up of a large number of reservists. Since the return of the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Cripps, to his country, rumors have spread, claiming that relations between Germany and the Soviet Union are strained. However, political figures here say that these rumors are not credible. The policy adopted by the Soviet government has been repeatedly declared externally, namely, armed neutrality. The Soviet government is now working to strengthen the strength of the Red Army, but this should not be mistaken for "general mobilization." It is difficult to say at this point whether the Soviet Union intends to abandon its neutral policy in the shortest possible time.

United Press, Moscow, 17th - Moscow may be the most calm capital in the world, because of recent shocking reports of an inevitable Soviet-German conflict from the Balkans, Scandinavia, and the Near East. However, Moscow is completely indifferent. There is a reliable indication here that the Soviet Union has not already fully mobilized, but has already partially mobilized its reserve forces. Cafes and parks in the city are as crowded as usual with young people, who should be in military uniform if war were imminent. Both the Soviet Union and Germany continue to deny that there have been new economic and political negotiations, and neutral diplomatic circles cannot confirm this news. However, this is not enough to indicate that the Soviet Union is not prepared to cope with emergencies. The catchphrase "prepared in the public's mind" can be heard everywhere. Any speech or article here on international affairs cites Stalin's warning to "maintain a state of mobilized readiness so that no foreign trickery can succeed" as a guideline. Soviet newspapers and radio stations constantly publish prominently news of the Red Army actively drilling in summer camps and preparing for the annual major exercises. At the same time, volunteer groups, under the supervision of the Red Army, are training millions of citizens in exercises to deal with paratroopers. The domestic peasant self-defense organizations formed in Belarus and Moscow have acquired the skills to fight against suddenly landed enemy troops and can be used to protect the country's airfields, bridges, railways, and power plants.

Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 18th - This summer, 1.5 million young people in southern Soviet Union will receive military training, and 2,000 military camps have been built.

United Press, Swedish Capital, 18th - The Scandinavian Telegraph Bureau received news from Finland yesterday that the Soviet army is conducting exercises on the Karelian Isthmus. It also stated that the Soviet army has destroyed many important railway bridges and has adopted other military plans.

United Press, London, 18th - Non-military circles here are concerned about the importance of Soviet-German relations. Diplomatic circles believed yesterday that President Hitler would conclude a new agreement with Stalin to avoid military conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union. A spokesman said that Stalin would temporarily lift the ban of April 29 prohibiting the passage of military supplies through Soviet territory to supply other countries. The spokesman said that he believed Soviet railways and ports might be open to German military supplies entering the Near East or being transported to Iran as a base for the German attack on Britain. However, the spokesman also believed that President Hitler might make the same request to Turkey, allowing military supplies or troops to pass through Turkish territory. If Stalin agrees to the request, German military supplies can also be transported from the Soviet Union to Japan. Observers recalled that there was a report on Monday that Japan and Germany had formed a close agreement stipulating that Japan would exchange tropical products for German military supplies.

### Reorganization Plan for Europe, Soviet Union's Attitude Unclear

Havas News Agency, Vichy, 17th - According to observers here, the Soviet Union will soon state its attitude towards the reorganization plan for Europe. It is expected that relations between Germany and the Soviet Union will not deteriorate in the near future, and the Soviet Union will not refuse to participate in the plan to establish a "New Europe." To a large extent, it will adopt the same form as the understanding with Germany in 1939. Rumors of Anglo-Soviet rapprochement and Soviet mobilization have not been confirmed. The Soviet Union's current Far East policy is also very cautious. The recent economic agreement with Japan and the border demarcation agreement between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" are indications that the Soviet Union intends to continue its neutral policy.

### Soviet Factories Complete Half-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule

TASS, Moscow, 18th - The number of factories completing their annual production plan ahead of schedule is increasing. Several steel factories have completed their half-year plan. All Soviet pipe factories have also completed their half-year production plan, and some have exceeded their July plan. The oil fields in Baku, Grozny, and elsewhere, as well as major machinery manufacturing plants and chemical industrial plants, have also completed their six-month plans. Factories in the new Soviet republics and regions have also achieved great success, and some have completed their seven-month plans.

### Young People Request to Serve in the Red Army

TASS, Moscow, 18th - Graduates of primary schools and vocational schools, young workers, and staff have written to military commissions, expressing their willingness to choose service in the Red Army as a lifelong career. The number of applicants to the Timoshenko Tank School has exceeded the planned enrollment. The number of applicants to the junior artillery school is twelve times the planned enrollment. The number of applicants to other cavalry military schools is also very enthusiastic. Lieutenant General Smirnov, head of the Red Army Education Department, told reporters that the number of applicants to military schools this year has greatly exceeded that of last year. Young people admitted to military schools are well prepared for military science. They have received preliminary practical training, obtained driver's licenses, and are qualified to be cavalry motorcycle drivers.

### New Soviet Bonds Issued, Public Oversubscribes

TASS, Moscow, 18th - The Soviet government issued 9.5 billion rubles of the fourth year of the Third Five-Year Plan national bonds, and the public enthusiastically subscribed. In 14 days, subscriptions reached 10,834,000,000 rubles, exceeding the original amount by 1,334 million rubles. At this point, the Soviet Union's new bond issuance campaign came to a successful conclusion.

TASS, Moscow, 18th - Regarding the oversubscription of the Soviet Union's new bonds, Deputy Commissar of Finance of the Soviet Union, Dakopin, recently wrote in "Pravda" that "the oversubscription of this new bond by 1,334,000,000 rubles shows again the greatness of the power of the socialist country to the world and their loyalty to the motherland, the Communist Party, and the great Stalin. The amount of subscriptions in 1938 was 5,928,000,000 rubles, last year it reached 9,433,000,000 rubles, and this year it reached 10,834,000,000 rubles. It took 60 days to fully subscribe in 1939, 20 days last year, and only 14 days this year. In addition to the cities of the Soviet Union, the people of the new republics also enthusiastically subscribed for the first time."

### Air Traffic Resumes Between Moscow and Riga

Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 18th - According to authoritative sources here, air traffic between Moscow and Riga is scheduled to resume today. The journey will take 4 hours and 20 minutes.

### Finland Risks Becoming a Battlefield Between Germany and the Soviet Union, Britain Stops Issuing Permits to Finland, Finland Should Announce Withdrawal from League of Nations

United Press, London, 18th - The Department of Economic Warfare instructed consulates last week to stop issuing naval permits to Finland, believing that the area is in danger of becoming a battlefield between Germany and the Soviet Union.

Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 18th - Officials here said that Finland has withdrawn from the League of Nations. The Finnish government, in view of the fact that most of the work of the League of Nations has been suspended since the outbreak of the European War, except for the specialized technical agencies that are still working normally, has recalled its representative stationed in Geneva and canceled the item in the financial budget that should be paid to the League of Nations.

### Soviet Experts Excavate Timur's Tomb, Emerald Stele and Ivory Door, 500-Year-Old Objects Intact

TASS, Moscow, 18th - The Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee of the Uzbek Republic recently led a team of scientists to begin excavating the tomb in the mausoleum of Timur, the Mongol conqueror, 536 years ago. The excavation revealed that precious objects were intact, such as marble window lattices and peach wood doors inlaid with ivory. Timur's tombstone is made of Chinese emerald, which is extremely precious.

### British Planes Take Advantage of the Bright Moonlight to Fiercely Attack German Industrial Areas, Flames Soar into the Sky in Three Cities on the Rhine, Fierce Air Battles Occur Along the French Coast

Reuters, London, 18th - British Air Force bomber squadrons launched a fierce attack on the largest production area in Germany, the Ruhr, for the sixth consecutive night on Monday night, targeting key war industries. According to the British Air Ministry Information Office, the sky was clear that night. Before the bright moon rose, many British planes had flown to the three cities of Cologne, Dusseldorf, and Duisburg and bombed them fiercely. These three cities are all on the Rhine River and were the main targets of the British planes that night. After the bombing, fires broke out on both banks of the river, and factories and houses were engulfed in flames. The German ground defenses resisted fiercely. Anti-aircraft shells exploded around the British planes, and countless searchlight beams swept across the sky, competing with the flames and the flares dropped by the British planes. The British pilots calmly responded, passing through the fire net and dropping bombs on the targets. After completing their mission, they returned to their defenses.

Reuters, London, 18th - Last night, British bombers, protected by several fighter squadrons, launched a large-scale offensive in the skies over the English Channel and the occupied areas. The British planes flew wing to wing, as dense as clouds, soaring over the Dover Strait and the French coast, creating a spectacular scene. Several fighter squadrons clashed with enemy planes, destroying 13 German fighters. The British planes also lost 10 planes.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 18th - Yesterday afternoon, British planes invaded German territory, and air battles immediately occurred. As a result, the British planes lost 20 planes, including 13 Hurricane fighters, 4 Spitfire fighters, 1 Blenheim bomber, and 2 destroyers. The German planes only lost 1 plane.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 18th - German bomber groups attacked the aircraft factory in Gloucester, southern England, the night before, causing fires in several places.

### Mines Laid in the Strait of Gibraltar, German Submarines Attack British Convoys in the Atlantic

Haitong News Agency, Algeciras, 18th - Yesterday morning, British planes from Gibraltar laid mines in the waters around the Strait, indicating that Axis submarines have been operating in the vicinity. Yesterday morning, eight British merchant ships and four warships sailed to the Mediterranean Sea, and in the afternoon, six merchant ships and one destroyer sailed to the Atlantic Ocean. On Monday night, five British planes, two oil tankers, and a general cargo ship arrived in Gibraltar.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 18th - Authorities here announced last night that as a result of German submarines attacking British convoys in the North and Central Atlantic, they had sunk five heavily armed merchant ships, totaling 31,953 tons.

### Japanese Representative Aizawa Returns to Japan at the End of the Month

United Press, Tokyo, 18th - The Nichinichi Shimbun reports that Aizawa, the head of the Japanese delegation in Batavia, is scheduled to leave for Japan on June 29. It also stated that the joint statement issued by the Dutch East Indies and Japan made continued negotiations between the two countries possible.

Reuters, Tokyo, 18th - The Hochi Shimbun stated that although the Japanese trade delegation has withdrawn from the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese government should continue to urge the Dutch East Indies government to cooperate with Japan to establish the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Aizawa is one of Japan's most capable diplomats and is known for his extraordinary patience in conducting negotiations. The Japanese government's appointment of Aizawa as the chief representative indicates the Japanese government's patience and willingness to obtain a compromise to the greatest extent possible. However, the Dutch East Indies government seems to regard Japan's moderate attitude as a sign of Japanese softening and continues to adopt an uncompromising attitude. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies indirectly referred to Japan as one of the Dutch East Indies' enemies in his speech to the People's Council on Sunday. If the Dutch East Indies continues to regard Japan as an enemy, the Japanese government should consider this and take decisive steps to make the Dutch East Indies understand Japan's ideal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

United Press, Tokyo, 18th - Officials announced today that the Japanese government has ordered Aizawa to return home from Batavia due to the failure of economic negotiations with the Dutch East Indies. However, this recall does not affect the normal relations between the two governments. The official communique also eliminates the general view that relations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies will immediately become critical and expresses Japan's hope to continue negotiations when the international situation is more favorable. Ishii, a spokesman for the Cabinet Information Bureau, said that the economic relations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies have been severely affected by the Dutch East Indies' mobilization for war purposes after the Dutch government fled from the Netherlands to London. The Japanese government cannot remain indifferent to the spread of the European War to the South Seas. Third countries such as Britain and the United States are able to participate in and utilize the economy of the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, Japan's demands are very reasonable. Ishii also said that Japan's demands include (1) participation in the development of the natural resources of the Dutch East Indies, (2) immigration and residence of Japanese people on the islands, (3) allowing Japanese ships to dock at nearby ports for the transportation of goods, (4) partial opening of coastal areas for Japanese navigation, (5) allowing Japanese people to develop fisheries, and (6) Japanese participation in the development of aviation and transportation. The official communique also stated that the Dutch East Indies government has repeatedly stated that its policy is based on promoting the progress, prosperity, and liberation of the Dutch East Indies residents, but Japan's demands do not conflict with the Dutch East Indies' policy. The progress, prosperity, and liberation of the Dutch East Indies residents must be improved through cooperation between Japan and the Dutch East Indies and contribute to peace and stability in East Asia, which goes without saying. However, the situation around the Dutch East Indies has become tense with the intensification of the economic war, making negotiations difficult. The Dutch East Indies' reply on June 6 was extremely unsatisfactory. The Japanese government, in view of the promises and declarations made by the Dutch and Dutch East Indies governments to Japan on this issue in the past, believes that the arguments in the Dutch East Indies' reply cannot be reconciled with an international agreement and has decided to suspend negotiations and recall the delegation.

### Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies Inspects Defenses and Reviews Bases

Reuters, Batavia, 18th - Since the German invasion of the Netherlands, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies has resumed his tour of inspection of the defenses in several places. This trip will go to Surabaya and Semarang to hold meetings with tribal chiefs and review defenses and naval bases.

### US Oil Exports Banned Except to Britain

United Press, Washington, 18th - Under Secretary of State Welles said that the general policy of the United States on shipping oil to Japan has not changed due to the recent ban on the export of machine oil from Philadelphia to Japan. Other sources told United Press reporters that Japan can still obtain oil not covered by the embargo from the West Coast and other ports. Secretary of the Interior Ickes instructed customs officials on Monday to prevent 752,000 gallons of lubricating oil from going to Japan and telegraphed 12 oil tanker companies, instructing them to temporarily suspend exports from the Atlantic before Ickes individually investigates them. Ickes said that the government is considering stopping all other oil exports except for oil from the Atlantic coast to Britain to alleviate the threat of domestic oil shortages.

Havas News Agency, Washington, 17th - Secretary of the Interior Ickes today also suggested to 102 kerosene exporters in the western coastal states of the United States that all kerosene and its by-products must stop exporting without prior government permission. The Japanese ship "Toyo Maru" is still in Philadelphia.

United Press, Chongqing, 18th - The English-language Chu Pao recently published an article saying that the United States should first stop Japan. The newspaper commented on the warning by the British East Coast to stop oil shipments to Japan and the recent warning by Japanese General 末决 that if the United States attacks Germany, Japan will participate in the war, saying that the breakdown of US-Japanese relations is due to either the United States first stopping Japan or Japan expelling the United States from the Far East. The most effective way for the United States to stop Japan is to ban all oil shipments to Japan and sever US-Japanese relations. We hope that Ickes's actions will be the prelude to Washington taking more severe steps.

### Bjornson Elected First President of Iceland

Haitong News Agency, Swedish Capital, 18th - London Radio announced this morning that Bjornson has been elected as the first president of Iceland. Bjornson was previously the representative stationed in Denmark.

### US Public Opinion Agrees to Prohibit Joining the Communist Party

Reuters, New York, 18th - A recent poll by Gallup shows that 71% of respondents believe that the law should prohibit joining the Communist Party, 22% oppose it, and 7% have no opinion. One notable point of this poll is that the largest percentage of opponents of making joining the Communist Party illegal is found in the wealthy class, while the class with the least income, including those who depend on relief for a living, has the lowest percentage of communists and the highest percentage of opponents of communism. According to the analysis of the Gallup Survey Agency, 70% of the upper class agree with the ban, 28% oppose it, 71% of the middle class agree, 24% oppose it, 72% of the lower class agree, and 16% oppose it.

### Memories of the United States' Entry into the War in 1917

On May 7, 1915, the British ship Lusitania was sunk by a German submarine, killing more than 1,100 men, women, and children, including more than 120 Americans. The news spread and shocked the country. President Wilson immediately sent a note to Germany saying, "The act of drowning passengers on a passenger ship is inhumane, and the German Imperial Government cannot excuse it. The United States Government values humanity more than material interests or commercial rights. There is nothing more noble and sacred in the world than human rights. All governments are proud of respecting human rights, and governments that violate humanitarianism are definitely not supported by the people."

At the time, some people believed that since the purpose of Germany's submarine policy was to prevent US military supplies from being transported to Britain and France, President Wilson could ban arms exports to befriend Germany and induce it to abandon its submarine policy. There is no way to prove that the President carefully considered this. Furthermore, even if the United States expanded the scope of embargoed goods to the maximum extent, it would not be enough to satisfy Germany's desires. Records of the German parliamentary investigation committee prove their attempt to threaten Britain with extreme starvation and force it to surrender to Germany. Hindenburg and Ludendorff also publicly stated in the winter of 1916 to 1917 that if Britain and France did not immediately accept Germany's peace terms, Germany would never abolish its submarine policy.

In addition, Wilson could of course declare that the government would not be responsible for protecting US merchant ships and citizens traveling on the high seas in order to avoid a head-on conflict with Germany. But Wilson believed that no government would dare to give up this right. He also replied to Senator Stone, "In times of war, no one country or several countries have the right to change or abolish the principles commonly recognized by all countries. If America's legal rights are disregarded, we will not hesitate to use any means for the sake of honor... We desire peace and should maintain it at any cost, but national honor is above all else, and we must not disregard it. If we fear retaliation and prohibit people from enjoying their due rights, it would be a great shame. Furthermore, if we weigh the pros and cons and make temporary concessions, it is difficult to guarantee that we will not continue to make concessions in the future. Once we give up our rights, it will inevitably lead to countless insults in the future. In short, this matter concerns American sovereignty, and America will never show weakness and give up its independent position in the international community."

This is Wilson's position announced to the world, especially to Germany, from the time Germany implemented its submarine policy in February 1915 until it sought to change it. At that time, he warned the German government that it would be held responsible for actions that harmed American lives and property, and the United States government would take various steps to protect its maritime rights. A year later, when the Sussex was sunk, this warning was given in the most urgent ultimatum. At that time, the United States informed Germany that "if the German Imperial Government does not immediately announce the cessation of submarine destruction, the United States Government will have no choice but to sever diplomatic relations with Germany."

This resolute warning did indeed have a temporary effect. But by the early autumn of that year, Hindenburg and Ludendorff were plotting to restore the submarine policy. Finally, on January 9, 1917, Hindenburg and Holtzendorff insisted that all opportunities for peace talks had disappeared and that the submarine policy had to be adopted to win. On January 31, German Ambassador to the United States Bernstorff announced that Germany would implement an unlimited submarine policy starting on February 1.

Wilson's failed peace mediation came to naught, and the breakdown of German-American relations was inevitable. Wilson felt that he had to put his previous warning into practice. Bernstorff said in his memoirs, "From then on - before then, Wilson had been constantly negotiating with us - Wilson believed that the German Empire had morally gone bankrupt... After January 31, 1917, Wilson was completely different. We declared an unrestricted submarine policy to oppose his mediation plan, which turned him into a deadly enemy of the German government."

After the United States severed diplomatic relations with Germany, Wilson waited many weeks to give Germany a chance to avoid war. When eight American merchant ships were sunk on March 27, Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany on April 2.

The various steps taken by Wilson were supported by the American people. His patient long-term negotiations on the Lusitania incident and his firm ultimatum on the Sussex incident had won the support of the people. In the autumn of 1916, his election was also the result of the support of the peace faction. He was not regarded as an extreme patriot because of the various steps he took against the submarine policy, and he became more popular because he "kept the United States out of the war." But after American merchant ships were sunk again on April 2, 1917, he declared that peace and honor were incompatible, and Congress passed a resolution to declare war on Germany by an overwhelming majority. On that day, he firmly declared to Congress, "There is one path that we cannot take and will not take, and that is the path of humiliation."

Thus, the United States, which had painstakingly maintained its own peace for two and a half years in the last European War, was finally drawn into the vortex of war. (To be continued)

### Astonishing Development in Free China: Rapid Progress in Heavy Industry, Abundant New Vitality After Resource Development, Shanghai and Hong Kong Floating Capital Eager to Move Inland for Cooperation

Yesterday's edition of the thirty-seventh issue of the English-language "Financial and Commercial Weekly" described "Important Industrial Plans in Free China." The article began by stating that the previous issue only covered a portion of the current new developments in Free China (as reported in various newspapers last Thursday). Now, news from various regions is arriving in rapid succession, indicating that various provinces already possess new life and vitality. This action will have a profound impact on the establishment of economic strength in non-occupied areas of China. On June 5th of this year, the joint office of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China announced that it would lend 100 million yuan to industrial organizations in Free China. Any factory willing to improve its equipment to assist in the great task of resistance and reconstruction would have priority. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has already instructed on how to allocate this loan.

Fujian Establishes Various Factories

In the past few weeks, the newly established Fu-Ken Company has been actively preparing to establish various machinery and metallurgical factories in Fujian Province. This great undertaking will not only allow the founders (overseas Chinese) to obtain satisfactory benefits, but will also greatly increase the province's production capacity. The company has a capital of 35 million yuan, supported by the Fujian Provincial Bank and Chen Yi, the chairman of Fujian.

Northwest Development: A Great Plan

Large-scale development plans in the Northwest are progressing rapidly. The Gansu Provincial authorities have borrowed 100 million yuan from the four banks, which will be allocated as follows: 39 million yuan for various industrial and mining industries, 15 million yuan for agricultural affairs, 8 million yuan for dredging and guiding, 20 million yuan for provincial commercial operations, and 18 million yuan for other undertakings that promote construction and directly benefit the people. This loan will be available for use within the month, and some plans have already been drafted and will be implemented in the short term. The Gansu Provincial authorities are astute and experienced, and have established many factories in the past year, and have also tried to support the industrial cooperative movement.

Gansu Expands Textile Industry

Recently, Yu Qiaqing made a report that surprised entrepreneurs in Shanghai and other places. The textile industry in Gansu Province is currently undergoing significant changes. The Chongqing government has invested in the establishment of five textile factories in the province, with a total capital of 1.5 million yuan. Another 200,000 yuan was loaned to small-scale rural textile industries. A larger textile factory will be established in Lanzhou, the provincial capital, with Chinese funding. Other plans to be established in the short term include a woolen mill affiliated with the Chongqing International Trade Commission and assisted by the China Wool Weaving Company. In addition, several textile factories jointly operated by Tianshui and other counties with the Agricultural Loan Committee are also being actively improved and expanded.

Yu Qiaqing Invests in Shaanxi Province

Yu Qiaqing, after inspecting the actual situation in the Northwest provinces, arrived in Hong Kong on the 9th of this month and has established a "Shaanxi Reclamation Company." Currently, the head office is located in Hong Kong, and a branch office will be established in Shaanxi. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong and overseas Chinese are enthusiastically subscribing to shares. The company attaches great importance to the development of Shaanxi Province's natural resources, such as coal, iron, cotton, and wool.

Guizhou's Mineral Resources Are Actively Exploited

On June 2nd of this year, the Guizhou Reclamation Company celebrated its first anniversary. Since its establishment, the company has achieved remarkable results. Initially, the capital was only 3 million yuan, but it has now increased to 13 million yuan. The company now plans to continue to develop and improve its various businesses in the coming year, and will attach great importance to the province's mining and transportation industries. Guizhou Province has steep terrain and unfavorable climate, hence the saying "no three and a half miles of flat land, no three days of sunshine." However, it is rich in mineral resources. Once transportation is improved and traffic becomes convenient, the future development prospects are very promising.

Savings for National Construction Bonds Are Eagerly Subscribed

The savings movement, which was initiated by the government on September 18th of last year, has yielded good results. As of mid-May of this year, the total amount of savings donations reached 30 million yuan. The various provinces in the interior are enthusiastically subscribing to "Savings for National Construction Bonds," and the donations from overseas Chinese in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and abroad are also very impressive. Although the results of this savings movement are very satisfactory, the government is not satisfied with past achievements and continues to call for greater assistance, and has begun to launch a new movement to increase the amount of subscriptions.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Makes an Urgent Appeal

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has made an urgent appeal to the people, urging them to increase voluntary savings to strengthen the country's economic position and combat strength. At the same time, the special committee established by overseas Chinese has listed the savings movement as one of its most important tasks. Therefore, large donations from overseas Chinese can be expected in the future. Overseas Chinese in the Philippines and Malaysia have already started a donation movement to achieve the expected goals. However, the Chongqing government seems dissatisfied with the attitude taken by capitalists in Shanghai and southern China on this matter, and hopes that donations from Shanghai and Hong Kong will increase significantly in the future. Responsible parties have made direct instructions and suggestions to transfer floating capital used for speculation to more patriotic uses to meet the needs of the country.

Factories Are Being Established One After Another in the Interior

The total amount of industrial investment in Free China has reached 150 million yuan by the end of last month. The value of products from inland factories was 350 million yuan last year, 140 million yuan the year before, and 70 million yuan in 1938. It is reported that the number of new factories engaged in production in the southern and northwestern provinces of China last year reached 1,400. It is expected that 400 new factories and textile factories will be added by the end of June this year. By the end of last year, 117,000 tons of industrial machinery and other items had been moved inland, of which 10,600 tons were moved inland in 1940, and the other 106,000 tons were moved inland in the first four months of 1940. The oil wells in Gansu regularly produce 60,000 to 70,000 gallons of oil per month. It is expected that after the recent renovation of new machinery, production will be greatly increased. It is estimated that the monthly output in the next few months will reach 450,000 gallons. In addition, at the beginning of this year, the monthly output of high-purity alcohol in Free China reached 420,000 gallons. This alcohol can be used to mix with gasoline. Recent innovations in production methods have made considerable progress. It is believed that the monthly output by the end of this year will reach 580,000 gallons. In addition, the hydropower project completed at the end of last year has been able to divert water to irrigate 361,000 acres of dry land, making it productive. By the end of next month, other similar new projects will be completed, irrigating another 100,000 acres of dry land.

### Coolidge Arrives in Shanghai on a Fast Trip, Hastily Returns Home Tonight, Enters Wusong Estuary at 9 PM Last Night, Urgently Needs to Return to the US, Sets Sail Early Tonight

The President Coolidge, a passenger ship of the American President Lines, returned to the US via Hong Kong after returning from Luzon. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in port this morning. According to company news, it entered Wusong at 9:00 PM last night and arrived in Shanghai at 11:00 PM. Passengers still need to take the company's passenger shuttle at 9:15 AM this morning to disembark at the New Customs Wharf. The ship was originally scheduled to stay in Shanghai for one night and set sail tomorrow morning to return. Now it is learned that it urgently needs to return to the US, so it will not delay much in Shanghai and will leave Shanghai early at 5:00 PM today to return to the US, heading straight for Honolulu and then to San Francisco. The last passenger shuttle will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 3:30 PM today.

### Progress in the Business of the Suzhong Company

Since its opening, the Suzhong Company has made rapid progress in its import and export businesses. Transportation and trust aspects are also being actively prepared. However, because the company's address is north of the Suzhou River Bridge, and it is simply listed as No. 430 North Shaanxi Road, some people mistakenly believe that it belongs to the security zone. In fact, the company is located at the intersection of Haining Road and North Shaanxi Road. In terms of transportation, buses on Route 5 and trolleybuses on Route 11 can directly reach without obstruction.

### After Akagi's Assassination, the Bureau Strictly Investigates, One More Suspect Arrested in Hongkou by the Japanese

After Akagi Chikashi, the Japanese Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Police, was assassinated the day before yesterday, according to Japanese sources yesterday, the suspect arrested by Shearlock is named Yu Senlin, 22 years old. It is said that the people who participated in the assassination first discussed it in Room 5 of the Daxie Hotel at No. 640 Huade Road, Hongkou. The Japanese immediately coordinated with the Shanghai Municipal Council's police to search the place, but no one was found and no items were left behind. Therefore, a barber named Zhu Laowu, 40 years old, was taken for interrogation, and martial law was announced in the Yangshupu area, searching house by house. It is now learned that the police are carefully investigating the case.

The Reason for Death Is Unclear

According to a certain foreigner close to Akagi, Akagi was one of the most active Japanese figures on the Shanghai political stage. He was capable and sincere in dealing with people. In the autumn of 1933, when he was the criminal section chief of the police department of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, he reported the leader of the Japanese Communist Party, Sano Manabu, in Nanshi. In 1934, he also reported a group of anarchists who attempted to assassinate the Japanese Minister Ariyoshi Akira. In April 1938, as a result of negotiations between the British and Japanese sides, he took office as the Japanese Deputy Director-General of the Police Department. His authority was only subordinate to the Director-General of the Police Department. In recent years, he has made many contributions to the issue of the return of the Shanghai Municipal Council's police power in the area north of the Suzhou River and the issue of the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area. The real reason for this assassination is still unknown.

The Body Is Cremated and a Public Funeral Will Be Held

It is reported that after Akagi, the Japanese Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Police, was assassinated and killed, his body was placed in his residence at No. 827 YuYuan Road, and he was placed in a coffin at 10:00 PM that day. At that time, his wife Reiko, Consul General Sone, Chief Secretary Shimoda, and Japanese police officers of the Shanghai Municipal Police recited scriptures at home. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the body was cremated. People from all walks of life related to the Japanese side went to pay their condolences one after another. Council Chairman Hill and Police Commissioner Bowman also sent letters to the Japanese Consul General to express their condolences. According to Japanese sources, the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai decided to hold a public funeral because Akagi had done his best to administer the concession during his lifetime. The Shanghai Municipal Council also intends to hold a public funeral to reward his efforts to maintain the security of the concession during his lifetime. According to this public funeral etiquette, it is unprecedented in both the Japanese Consulate General and the Shanghai Municipal Council.

### Japanese Marines Postpone Exercise Yesterday

According to foreign news, the Japanese Marines were originally scheduled to hold a large-scale exercise in the Zhabei area yesterday. It was specially announced yesterday that it would be postponed to the 28th.

### Waterworks Workers Resume Work

The labor-management dispute between the Jiangxi Road Yangshupu British Waterworks Company has been satisfactorily resolved. All workers and clerks have resumed work from yesterday. The company's announcements from both the management and labor sides are listed below: (1) "Announcement: From today, the wages of laborers will be three yuan per day per worker, including allowances. There will be three days of vacation for the Lunar New Year, and double wages for working." (2) "Announcement: From the date of resumption of work, the wages of all clerks will be increased by three cents per hour based on the wages in May."

Rice Shop Management Puts Forward Conditions

In the rice shop labor-management dispute, the management has put forward 16 conditions to the labor side, which are excerpted as follows: (1) Double salary is issued every year-end; (2) Monthly rules are 3 yuan per month, and workers get promoted every 5 days; (3) The salary of employees is divided into the following four grades according to the scope of business: 20 yuan for first-class shops, 16 yuan for second-class shops, 12 yuan for third-class shops, and 10 yuan for fourth-class shops. Ordinary employees, 32 yuan for first-class shops, 26 yuan for second-class shops, 20 yuan for third-class shops, and 16 yuan for fourth-class shops; (4) The rice allowance for employees is limited to No. 2 Saigon rice, and the standard is 80 yuan per picul. If it exceeds 80 yuan, there will be a subsidy of 2 yuan for every 10 yuan; (5) The monthly salary for clerks is 12 yuan;

### The Words "Republic of China" on Official Documents Must Not Be Omitted

The Military Affairs Commission believes that the official documents exchanged between various agencies, troops, schools, and legal entities across the country are not uniform. The words "Republic of China" are often omitted on the date of the Republic of China. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that the Republic of China is the general term representing the 450 million people of the nation, and it is also the supreme essence of respecting the national system. Recently, a special order has been issued to various places that if the words "Republic of China" are omitted, they should be corrected immediately.

### Going to America

— Wang Shiyue

Expressing the Aspirations Before Leaving the Country

After learning the news of the Russian general going abroad, many of my relatives and friends ran to ask me: "You are going to study in America, what kind of intentions are you holding, and what will you bring back to benefit this ancient and transforming nation?"

I listened to these questions with gratitude and fear, because I knew that the father teachers and friends of the motherland had extremely high expectations of me, and I couldn't help but hesitate. At this time, I am leaving the land and compatriots that I have been close to day and night for more than 20 years, and I will not be able to personally experience the suffering or happiness of the motherland for several years. I will not be able to follow my compatriots in arduous struggles for the time being. I will be temporarily estranged from the teachings of my parents and leaders. I am going to America, a corner of the world, and it will definitely cost a lot of energy accumulated from the blood and sweat of my compatriots. Then, how will I repay my relatives and elders? How will I make my trip the most rewarding? I can't help but fear whether my trip abroad is worthwhile in all aspects?

Going to America to learn something has long been an idea hidden in my heart. I have also repeatedly considered my goals and the direction of my efforts, so I am convinced that my decision to go to America cannot be said to be meaningless. But I still can't help but feel fear and hesitation because I now understand how deep the expectations of the elders are. I want to briefly reveal my current aspirations to the people of the country, and I hope this can give them some comfort!

For decades, thousands of students in China have embarked on that new continent with various goals. There are indeed many who have returned to contribute to our nation, but there are also many who are incompetent and make the people of the country feel disgusted with foreign students.

Take the students who go to study in America, for example. In terms of life, they are obsessed with the decadent hedonism of Americans, and what they listen to is nothing more than popular jazz music. What they talk about is nothing more than Hollywood, night markets, beauty, and clothing. Even food must be American goods, and their speech must be foreign languages. In terms of thinking, they advocate complete Westernization and despise "lowly" compatriots. Today, they move an experimental doctrine, and tomorrow, they move an empirical theory, boasting of novel terms and foreign celebrities to those who have not been gilded, but in fact, they themselves may not have in-depth research. In terms of academics, they swallow dates whole, bringing back some American technologies that are not suitable for the national conditions to the backward China, and instead resent that the motherland cannot use such excellent talents, but do not blame themselves for not keeping the motherland in mind during their studies. Such students are not only completely unnecessary in China, but even in America, they may not be disgusted by their putting up a sheep's head and selling dog meat. In fact, they have never glimpsed the true American culture and American spirit.

I dare not be different and innovative, and I dare not think that my aspirations are something that foreign students have not noticed or paid little attention to in the past few decades, but I feel that my going to America has an unusual insight. Taking this opportunity to express my hopes is nothing more than the meaning of Confucius's "each fulfilling his ambitions."

But I realize that my going to America has a goal that I consider worthwhile, that is, to learn the excellent nation-building spirit of Americans. And I think that such learning is the view of foreign students on the motherland at this period, but this new atmosphere is lacking.

This pursuit of pioneering and establishing a business has a majestic new spirit, which the descendants of America have inherited from their ancestors, and constantly improved and strengthened it. Therefore, it has formed a unique and excellent tradition in America, everything is practical, changing with each passing day, and democratic.

Foreign students often use "seeking further education" as the reason for their study abroad. But I think that still like in China, being locked in a study or laboratory, studying hard, without raising their necks to absorb this new atmosphere, then what they get is nothing more than dead American knowledge, which is not the strength of America, but just the fur that is of no benefit to the motherland. As for living a more comfortable life over there than in one's own country, that is too unworthy.

I hope that in America, I can observe how Americans are displaying this excellent tradition in their actual lives. How fast is their work spirit? How realistic is their research on their achievements, without false pretense. How little do they show favoritism and seek personal gain when implementing plans. How unafraid of hardship and determined to the end are they when removing the old and renovating. These are all urgently needed to be adopted in China.

I am just a young man with a high desire for knowledge. I am just a student who is eager to learn some new and progressive things. I understand that what China needs most today is not the foreign affairs and Europeanization that are enough to show off, but the new spirit that is necessary to build a new country.

America is not a completely unfamiliar place to me, and Americans are not a nation that is difficult to approach and understand. I expect to receive a lot of sincere hospitality and assistance when I go to America this time. The warmth expressed in the "Student Lunch" hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce has convinced me of this.

I hope that when I return a few years later, I will have truly learned the excellent democratic and progressive spirit of America. I hope that I will take into account China's special conditions and follow my compatriots in striving and working together to build a new, independent, free and democratic country.

### Saigon Telegram: Cheap Saigon Rice Shipped, Rice Shops Reduce Weight in Various Ways, Hong Kong Purchases Rice from Yangon to Ship to Shanghai

The Fair Price Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 Mixed Broken Rice handled by the foreign firms of the Import Control Committee of the French Municipal Council. The Shin Kee firm, a handler of the Import Committee, received a telegram from Saigon yesterday stating that the first batch of 1,000 tons (10,000 bags) of fair-priced Saigon broken rice had already been shipped to Shanghai some days ago by the Albert Sahut, which is expected to arrive in port on the 25th of this month. The selling price after arrival in port is 87 yuan per picul. The remaining large amount of Saigon broken rice that has already been sold in Shanghai will also be shipped to Shanghai one after another before the end of this month.

Shortening the Rice Scale, Five Months Imprisonment

Zhang Hexiang, the head of the patrol of the Shanghai Municipal Police Station of the Public Concession, found on the 6th of this month that the standard measuring instrument used by the Tongfu Rice Shop at No. 295 North Jiangxi Road was shortened by about half an inch on the five-liter measuring instrument, so the rice it sold was short by three 合 per five liters. He then reported to the First Special Court to issue a summons. This morning, Shen Shilian, the owner of Tongfu Rice Shop from Pudong, was summoned to the Criminal Eighth Court. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, prosecuted according to Article 208, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for using weights and measures that violated the regulations. The defendant's behavior was particularly unforgivable, and he requested that he be punished with a more severe corporal punishment according to law. Shen供 stated that the measuring instrument was taken over from Tongshun Rice Shop, and he discovered it was short, so he never used it. Judge Zhu Chuzhe verified the statement and sentenced Shen Shilian to five months imprisonment in court as a warning.

Shortage of Weight, Manager Detained

Also, on the 4th of this month, when Shenyuan Rice Shop at No. 79 Beihai Road sold 5斗 of rice to Chang Youcai, who lives at No. 14 Zhejiang Road, it deliberately shorted half a catty. After reporting to the Laoza Police Station, Detective Shen Dehui investigated and found the facts to be true, and reported to the First Special Court to issue a summons, ordering Chen Wenbin, the manager of the shop from Nanxiang, to appear in the Criminal Fifth Court for trial this morning. Chen did not arrive this morning and commissioned a clerk Jin to represent him in court. The police lawyer Fang Fushu prosecuted for fraud. Judge Zhan Liangce said that the criminal case must be attended by the person himself, so he ordered the hearing to be rescheduled. If Chen fails to appear in court again, he will be detained.

The First Batch of Tribute Rice Was Ordered Yesterday

According to news from Xiangmao Foreign Company yesterday, the 285,000 bags of foreign rice from the first phase of the Shanghai Municipal Council had all been ordered by more than 30 grain shops in the city as of yesterday. 160,000 bags sold by the rice shops in the two concessions, and the remaining 125,000 bags could also be sold out by the end of this month. Since the authorities stipulated that the selling price of the second phase of foreign rice should be increased, the grain shops have increased in quality and have gone to order them one after another. As of yesterday, 5,000 tons had been approved to the grain shops at the newly ordered price.

Hong Kong's Procurement Efforts Continue

According to rice industry news, the total amount of rice currently stored in Hong Kong has reached 800,000 bags. Because the Hong Kong government stipulates that 500,000 bags must be stored regularly, the remaining 300,000 bags can be used for Shanghai. In order to continuously supply Shanghai's needs, it is currently purchasing a large amount from Yangon. However, for the convenience of procurement, the Hong Kong government does not limit the rice samples for procurement to 小絞米. If Min Party rice is convenient, Min Party rice will be purchased. The date of Min Party rice arriving in Shanghai will be in early next month. The foreign rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council that arrived in Shanghai yesterday was from Taikoo Company's Yuezhou and Anhui.

### Wang Qingmu Passed Away

Wang DanKui, courtesy name Qingmu, a respected elder of Chongming, passed the Gengchen examination in the Qing Dynasty and was selected as a bachelor of the Hanlin Academy and a board member. He was specially dispatched to Nanyang to investigate commercial affairs. He successively served as a counselor and right vice minister of the Ministry of Commerce, and was appointed as a provincial judicial commissioner. Because he did not agree with Xiangcheng, he requested to be dismissed from his post. At that time, the discussion of the commercial management of the railways in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was very heated. He was elected as the director general and pioneered the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Later, because the Ministry of Revenue established officials to reorganize the finances of various provinces, he was appointed as the chief supervisor of financial management in Zhejiang. After the founding of the Republic of China, he served as the Director of Finance of Jiangsu. Throughout his life, he requested water conservancy projects, and the government specially appointed him as the Director-General of Taihu Lake Water Conservancy. Finally, he was a member of the Huai River Conservancy Commission. He wrote the "Agricultural Hermitage Essays". His learning focused on personal practice and was the same as Shangshu Tang Weizhi's study of Song Dynasty, not for flowery words and rhymes. After the Incident, he lived in Shanghai, closed his doors to guests. He was eighty-two years old this year and still cared about national affairs. On his deathbed, he regretted not seeing the complete rivers and mountains. It was almost the same feeling as Lu You's poem to his son at the family sacrifice. It is now heard that his family has taken his body to the Central Funeral Home for viewing today. Those who hear it cannot help but feel the pain of the death of a man and the suffering of the country.

### Students Studying in the United States Donate Money to Help Students in Their Motherland

The Chinese Students' Association in North America and Nanyang, an organization of Chinese students studying in the United States, recently held costume and art donation events in Philadelphia and other places during the summer vacation in order to help struggling students in their motherland. With the support of overseas Chinese from various places, the funds raised will be remitted to students in mainland China for their studies.

### Yesterday Morning, a Time Bomb Exploded in Hongkou Park: Two Chinese People Severely Injured, Serious Situation, Japanese Troops Searching

Yesterday morning, a bomb explosion suddenly occurred in Hongkou Park on Jiangwan Road. Two Chinese people were severely injured on the spot. Afterwards, the Japanese side took strict precautions and conducted a large-scale search of pedestrians and vehicles in the area. The precautions were lifted at noon. The details are recorded separately as follows:

Underneath the Bench, Two Bombs Detonated Simultaneously

At 8:30 yesterday morning, two bombs suddenly exploded simultaneously under a bench in the eastern part of Hongkou Park on Jiangwan Road, where visitors often sit to rest. The loud explosion reverberated far and wide. At the time, two young Chinese men were sitting side by side on the bench, talking. They bore the brunt of the explosion. One had his right hand blown off, and the other had his right leg blown off. Flesh and blood were scattered everywhere, a truly horrific sight. The Japanese Marine Corps, being nearby, immediately dispatched personnel. Soon, the Japanese Military Police also arrived after hearing the alarm. They immediately transported the injured to the Japanese Field Hospital in Jiangwan for treatment. It is said that the two men were seriously injured and their lives are in danger.

Strict Precautions in Hongkou District

After the incident, the Japanese side considered the bomb to be unusual and dispatched a team from the military authorities to conduct a thorough search in the surrounding area. All bridges over the Suzhou Creek were also temporarily placed under guard, and pedestrians and vehicles were searched with great rigor. The precautions were lifted around 12:20 noon. According to a statement by the Japanese Navy spokesman yesterday, the bomb was a time bomb, and it was found to be the same as the bomb that exploded last week at the residence of Hanawa Yutaro, the manager of Mitsui & Co. at 112 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession. Another rumor is that the injured were the ones who threw the bomb, as someone claimed that they were ordered to throw the bomb. However, it is understood that the two injured Chinese people were severely injured on the spot, lost consciousness due to the pain, and were unable to speak. Therefore, this statement may not be accurate.

Injured Confess to Placing the Bomb for Someone Else

According to external sources, the two Chinese men who were injured in the bombing are about 21 to 22 years old. One had his right arm blown off, and the other had his right leg blown off. They were rushed to the hospital, and their injuries are very serious. It is feared that they may not survive. It is reported that one of the injured has admitted that they were paid to carry the bomb for someone else. He was still holding a few dice in his hand, playing a dice game with the other person to pass the time. After the incident, the Japanese Navy authorities launched an investigation, believing that the two bombs yesterday morning were the same as the bombs that exploded recently in the Donghe and Rongguang theaters in Hongkou.

### Watchman Killed, Criminals Captured

On November 10 of last year, a watchman at 516 Lane 16 on Father Lao Road in the French Concession was robbed of his service pistol by a bandit. At the time, the watchman resisted, and the bandit shot and killed him. Two of the bandits were arrested yesterday in Nanshi, and two pistols and seven bullets were seized. Subsequently, guided by the two bandits, the murderer who killed the watchman at 516 Lane was captured on Kangti Road. All three bandits are repeat offenders who have committed crimes and taken drugs in the French Concession.

### Kidnapping of Liu Jianwu, Three Criminals Convicted

The kidnappers Huang Ziping from Datuan, Jiang Xinkang from Yong, He Youting from the local area, and the fugitive mastermind Li Guozhang kidnapped Liu Jianwu at Jing'an Villa, 527 Chengdu Road, at 11:15 pm on May 14. They were arrested after the incident, and along with two pistols and twelve bullets, they were escorted to the First Special Court. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the trial yesterday morning. Huang Ziping was sentenced to seven years and six months of imprisonment, and Jiang Xinkang and He Youting were each sentenced to seven years. The guns and bullets were confiscated.

### Taking Pornographic Photos, Discovered by the French Police

Li Zhushu, a 39-year-old rogue from Suzhou, recently spent money to hire shameless men and women to take pornographic photos on the fourth floor of 147 Huageneau Road in the French Concession. He sold them to various places, making a lot of profit. However, due to poor secrecy, the French police discovered the scheme. At 2:00 am yesterday morning, Inspector Cao Chunsheng led detectives Du Shunyi, Feng Yunbao, and Xu Guizhu to the address to make arrests.

### Grain: Rice Weevils Truly Leave No Crack Unturned, Taking Advantage of the Times to Raise Prices, Despite Abundant Supply at the Source, Rice Prices Still Rise by Five to Six Yuan

The rise in foreign rice prices intensified yesterday, with both spot and futures rice rising across the board, increasing by three, five, or six yuan compared to the previous day. Although the reason is that customers have increased sales and the Municipal Council has increased approval prices, the activity of speculators, the price increases by sellers, and the blind following of speculators are sufficient to push up market prices. Those who pass the buck and shift responsibility are further fueling the flames, and the market has even seen a return to the state of skyrocketing prices of the past. After the market opened early in the morning, in addition to the competition among the Ningbo, Xiang, and Shantou merchants, there was also talk of the Beiyang merchants re-exporting 3,000 tons of Dafu Yuangen rice. Furthermore, after the Shanghai Municipal Council announced that the previously determined 280,000 bags had arrived, the approval prices for the next month increased by four yuan and six cents for both Xiaojiao and Min Dang. The original approval price for Xiaojiao was 124.7 yuan, which increased to 128.76 yuan, and the retail price also increased from 130.5 yuan to 137 yuan. The original approval price for Min Dang was 127.2 yuan, which increased to 131.26 yuan, and the retail price also increased from 136.2 yuan to 139.5 yuan. As a result, the buying interest was strong, and speculators, worried about the international situation, were manipulated by price increases. Spot and futures rice prices soared by two or three yuan at times. In the afternoon, the buying interest did not decline, and spot rice prices increased by another one or two yuan. Saigon futures were very popular. The spot price of No. 1 Saigon reached 123 yuan in the early morning, but the asking price was even higher in the afternoon, but no transactions were made. Broken rice was 94 yuan in the morning and 95 yuan in the afternoon. Xiaojiao rose repeatedly in the morning to 117.5 yuan, and reached 119 yuan in the afternoon. No. 1 Saigon was particularly priced at 122 or 123 yuan, but ultimately settled at 119.5 yuan. No. 2 was 116.5 yuan, 115 yuan, and bagged futures were 111.5 yuan. No. 1 special Siamese rice, due to its scarcity and fragrant taste, was particularly outstanding, and was priced as high as 132 yuan, 127 yuan. Compared to No. 1 Saigon, the price difference was as high as six or seven yuan, which was beyond the expectations of most sellers. As for No. 2 Siamese rice, the high price was also 116.5 yuan, and the final price was 113.5 yuan. Burma rice was 119 yuan, Min Dang ordinary was 123.5 yuan, 123 yuan, Xiaojiao Pudong Warehouse was 117.5 yuan, 116.5 yuan, Peixi Warehouse was 117 yuan, 116 yuan, and Tokyo Zhongguan 硜尖 was 108.5 yuan, 107 yuan. Broken Jian rose from 94.2 yuan to 91 yuan. No. 1 broken was 80 yuan. Yinghua Company's No. 1 Saigon opened at 138 yuan in the morning, but because the increase in recent days was not enough, it did not rise as rapidly as Xiaojiao broken rice, so it also reached a huge 142 or 143 yuan in the afternoon. Broken rice was from 109 to 110 yuan, Xiaojiao was 141 or 142 yuan, and the road was 138 or 139 yuan. Transactions totaled 1,800 tons, and more than 20,000 bags of spot rice. In addition to the fact that the New Trading Association directly finalized multiple batches of broken rice that were not announced, the market also saw Siamese No. 2 rice released by Peifeng at 500 tons, priced at 130 yuan, and Jiafo rice at 200 tons, priced at 141 yuan, which was said to be released by Nanqiao.

Because most sellers saw foreign rice prices rise sharply, their intention to sell remained firm. Although the rural stores sold a little more, the overall demand remained weak. As a result, with the support of the sellers, both Jing rice prices increased by one or two yuan. Fresh Nanhang early and late rice was priced at 134 yuan to 132 yuan. However, the prices of old futures were still average, only selling for 127 or 128 yuan. Old packaged rice was 130 yuan, and old packaged Wuxi Jing rice was priced at 124 or 125 yuan due to its low price.

Hong Kong glutinous rice has always followed foreign rice prices, so the two echoed each other and increased together. Special grain white was priced at 17 or 18 yuan, long grain was 116 yuan, yellow was 113.5 yuan, glutinous green was 107 or 108 yuan, and second-grade was 105 yuan. Domestic glutinous rice, due to the weather, could not be kept for long, and sellers were worried that the quality of the rice would suddenly change, so their intention to sell was still relaxed, resulting in prices remaining average, continuing to open at 121 or 122 yuan, and ultimately at 120 yuan.

The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai is very strong. Two ships arrived the day before yesterday, directly carrying 70,000 bags of foreign rice from Burma. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the China-Java Lijn's ship, the Tjisadane, also arrived in Shanghai from Java, carrying more than 16,000 bags of Java foreign rice, and docked at the Peidong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading (Zu).

### New Wheat Still Unable to Be Transported, Flour Prices Rise Sharply

Flour: The rise in foreign flour prices continued yesterday. In terms of customer sales, there are signs of buying activity, and both the northern and southern merchants have added to their orders, but the number is not large. The market situation is that the international situation is deteriorating, and there are concerns about overseas sources. Furthermore, the delivery of this year's domestic new wheat to Shanghai is full of complications, and most grain merchants and operators have given up hope. Therefore, people's confidence is gradually increasing, and hoarders are very enthusiastic, with a strong trend of following suit. Jinlong flour initially opened at 30.08 yuan to 31 yuan. It continued to increase in the afternoon, once rising to 31.15 yuan, and closed at 31.05 yuan. Paotai flour was 22.1 yuan to 32 yuan, Caishen flour was 30.07 yuan, Shuangying brand was 30.09 yuan, and Xiangjiao brand was 30.07 yuan. Nearly 30,000 bags were traded, and market prices rose by another six or seven cents. However, the market momentum slightly weakened, because some small investors who had made profits emerged.

Wheat: Wheat trading was quiet yesterday, because the new wheat in the mainland was temporarily unable to be transported. Even the goods that the factory was receiving had not arrived. Furthermore, with flour prices high, brokers were trying to raise prices, so no sales were made, and the market remained stagnant.

### Speculators Aggressively Hoarding, Corn Prices Jump by Five Yuan

Corn prices, after falling sharply, rose suddenly on the previous two days because the international situation was tight. Those who thought they were quick-witted feared that once the southward advance was implemented, the source of corn would be affected. They took advantage of the slightly improved sales in the southern, Zhejiang, northern, and tobacco markets and aggressively hoarded corn, causing prices to rise suddenly. Yesterday's highest price was four or five yuan higher than the previous lowest price. A total of more than 6,000 bags of various types of corn were traded. The prices of Saigon old corn ranged from 14.2 yuan to 26 yuan, mixed new corn ranged from 25 yuan to 26.6 yuan, and completely new corn ranged from 28.8 yuan to 30 yuan. Dutch white corn ranged from 26.8 yuan to 28 yuan, and yellow corn ranged from 18.6 yuan to 29.3 yuan. Today, 550 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong, and 3,200 bags were shipped to Singapore.

### Securities: Unified Bonds Rise Sharply, Breaking Through 80 Yuan, Others Also Follow Up

The gray market for government bonds suddenly rose sharply yesterday, with Class A bonds being the most affordable, which suited the psychology of most people, so their rise was particularly strong. Class C bonds and others also rose sharply. It was rumored that the financial community had a need for them, but this remains to be verified. Yuxing suddenly turned from short to long, with a very strong appetite, attracting the attention of many people. Class A bonds broke through the 80 yuan mark, Class C bonds broke through 71 yuan, Class B bonds broke through 73 yuan, and Class E bonds were close to 70 yuan, gradually approaching the highest prices on January 21 and 22 of this year. This can be described as a good phenomenon of soaring prosperity. Looking at the trading floor, there is still potential for continued rise, but it depends on the actual strength. Yesterday morning, Dingkang, Zhenkang, Tongkang, and Xiekang were buyers, and Xinfu and Hongda were sellers. The market price immediately rose by several cents. In the afternoon, Xinfu turned into a buyer, and Yuxing, which had sold the day before, bought in even larger quantities, which was considerable. Others such as Dingkang, Runde, Hongtai, Xiangyi, and Changyi were also buyers. Lianhe, Lianyi, Changkang, Yitai, and Jiucheng were all sellers, and the number was also very considerable. The buyers were still more courageous than the sellers. Class A bonds broke through the 80 yuan mark, and other bonds also rose with the trend, but not as sharply as Class A bonds. Market prices ultimately continued to rise by nine cents to one yuan and forty-five cents. Transactions totaled around 3.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

### Finance: US-German Relations Are Hanging by a Thread, US Dollar Continues to Ease

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no changes in the HSBC-listed exchange rates. In the gray market, the British-US exchange rate was slightly weaker, mainly due to the deteriorating situation in US-German relations. Furthermore, Chinese speculators initially sold heavily, and Japanese Mitsui sold heavily in June US dollars, causing near-term prices to harden to 5.46875 yuan. July was also hard at 5.5 yuan. A small portion of scattered short positions entered, so the trend stabilized later. Ultimately, Jin Chang from Tianjin flattened out, and the others evened out. Trading was quite active in the first half of the day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Japanese Merchants Also Sell

According to morning foreign telegrams, Indian silver has recently fallen, and near-term prices are flat with US and British currencies.

Japanese gold notes and Korean notes were both weakening, with the former falling to 1.88 yuan and the latter falling to 1.59 yuan.

### Hedging and Covering, Gold Market Is Weak and Unable to Rise, Spot Prices Actually Rise

The gold market saw continued weakness in early trading yesterday. This was due to the fact that US-German relations were on the verge of breaking down, the US dollar continued to ease, and people's confidence in all quarters was weakening. Furthermore, securities and silverware shops offered to sell, and merchants who had hedged the previous day also came to cover their positions, causing prices to fall from 6,350 yuan twice to 6,325 yuan, and ultimately rising by 14 yuan. Trading totaled 20,000 taels in the first half of the day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. For rolling over from June to July, the seller, Decheng, posted 50 cents for 200 taels to Yida, and Xinfengyong and others posted 52 yuan for 700 taels. Cash prices actually rose. Gonghe sold 20 taels to silverware shops at a price 370 yuan higher than the futures price.

Suddenly, it was heard that the US dollar for this month could also be settled at 5.46875 yuan. Dafeng, Defu, Gonghe, Yida, Gongda, and Yiyuan successively sold heavily, followed by many others, falling to 6,325 yuan. Yiyuan bought again, and Heshengheng also bought, gradually rising to 6,342 yuan. Soon, Dafeng, Xinfengyong, Defu, and Chengji came to sell again, and near noon, it was again 6,325 yuan, for floating short positions. It rose to 6,335 yuan. At noon, the closing price was 6,331 yuan, which was 14 yuan lower than the closing price the day before. After the rollover, it has been found that it has been falling for four consecutive days, for a total of 109 yuan. The settlement price for the July US dollar at 5.46875 yuan was 6,368 yuan, for a premium of 37 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 30 yuan in the first half of the day. After the close, it fell to 6,327 or 6,328 yuan. The selling price of the bank's own brand of gold was 400 yuan higher than the early trading price, and the purchase price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. The current margin is still without price or market.

Ornamental Gold Prices Have Not Changed

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at Dataong and Xintong are still listed at 695 yuan and have not changed, it is said.

### Yarn: Poor Environment, Many Double-Horse Short Covering Positions, Still Absorbing a Few Bales

The yarn market saw a roundabout and tired trend. Due to the serious international situation, the general floating longs turned from long to short, which made people feel depressed. At the same time, the sales of customer merchants were not as prosperous as the previous day, so the market felt even weaker. Short sellers continued to roll over their positions, rolling out by 2.5 cents. However, long positions with sufficient financial resources, seeing that although the situation was deteriorating, US cotton prices were rising day by day, and the factory's costs were gradually increasing, absorbed a few bales and ultimately had no intention of selling. As a result, factory orders remained dry, and short sellers still found it difficult to deliver. The high price for Shuangma was 1,497 yuan, and the low price was 1,482 yuan. The market situation was extremely flat in the afternoon, initially trading at 1,485 yuan, rising to 87 yuan, and ultimately the price was 1,484.5 yuan. Today, 2,190 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 60 pieces were shipped to Singapore.

Shuangma opened in the morning, and because the news reported a tense situation, most people in the market were inclined to sell. The opening price was 1,490 yuan, and it fell to 86 yuan shortly thereafter. However, buying interest rose again, rising to 1,497 yuan. Subsequently, due to the small floating profits, short sellers increased their positions, and the floating longs closed their positions. The market price fell to 1,482 yuan and returned to close at 1,485 yuan. The total trading volume in the first half of the day was 8,400 bales, of which 150 bales were bought by Hong Kong merchants and 8,300 bales were speculated by colleagues.

The Jin Shuangma standard yarn market situation remained flat, with a narrow range and a stable trend. The price of July futures fell by 6 yuan, and the price of August futures fell by 5.5 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 6,250 bales. The high, low, and closing prices for the day are recorded on the left:

### Ordering American Cotton Must Be Certified by Manufacturers to Prevent Speculative Resale

The current cotton situation is extremely firm. Because American cotton is rising daily, people are anxious. However, future purchases from America must be certified by manufacturers to prevent speculators from reselling to foreign merchants for transport and export.

South Taicang, 207 Xinhuo Factory, 300 bales delivered to the factory

Tongzhou Cotton, 205 Donghua Factory, 500 bales exclusive of tax

Rangoon Cotton, 209 House, 300 pieces for delivery at the warehouse

Also, 120 pieces again, and 100 pieces again

Middling, 466 again, and 100 pieces again

Again, 465 again, and 100 pieces again

Again, 468.5 again, and 100 pieces again

Again, 470 again, and 100 pieces again

Bai Luoqu, 276 again, and 200 pieces again

Pengjiapo, 340 again, and 100 pieces again

Another report: Foreign cotton transactions by foreign firms in Shanghai are exciting, and the market outlook is bullish. This is because the rise in American cotton is intensifying, and the current yarn situation is good. Therefore, factories such as Wing On, Shen Xin, Xinhuo, and China Textile are all continuing to order large quantities of Brazilian cotton. As for the cotton brokerage houses, they are also unwilling to be outdone and are continuously purchasing small amounts of American cotton and Indian cotton.

The New York cotton market initially rose due to buying by speculators in the industry, followed by active short covering. At the same time, industry players continued to buy amid soaring prices. As a result, the closing price rose by about 20 points compared to the previous day.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Prices are Externally Weak and Internally Tight Due to Firm Yarn Prices

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was stable, with sales being slow, but factory prices were surprisingly tight. Therefore, cloth prices fluctuated very little, presenting a situation of external weakness and internal tightness. As a result, some white goods, including coarse and fine cloth and twill, fell (per piece) by 10 to 25 cents. Dyed cloth remained unchanged. Shen Xin No. 9 Factory offered 300 packages of futures of Fuguigui fine cloth and 100 packages of fine twill, with the opening price increased by 75 cents to one yuan. Over 200 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street, mostly seasonal seersucker, foreign yarn, poplin, bleached cloth, linen, and retail market goods. Over 200 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth were handled by Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang brokers. Over 100 pieces of printed cloth and coarse cloth were handled by Qingdao brokers from the North Road. Today, 1,555 pieces of piece goods are being shipped to Hong Kong and 225 pieces to Singapore.

Eastern Cloth: The market initially showed fatigue due to the increasingly tense situation between the United States and Germany. However, yarn and cotton prices remained firm, and spot sales and hoarders showed activity. Therefore, futures of fine cloth on the exchange not only did not fall but also rose slightly (per piece) by 10 to 17-18 cents. Demand for spot Longtou warehouse receipts was low, falling by 5 cents. The afternoon closing price was 44.75 yuan, but spot Longtou was particularly scarce, with initial trades at 44.30 yuan, gradually approaching the warehouse receipt price. Colored goods, the Four Gentlemen's Serge, remained steadily upward due to the cost of 12-count yarn, which was insufficient. The chips for yellow warehouse receipts became increasingly scarce, and those shorting were wary. Trading was particularly active throughout the day, fluctuating between 1.49 yuan and 1.4975 yuan. The evening closing price was 1.495 yuan, an increase of .00625 per yard.

### Metals: Lead and Iron Continue to Rise

The metal market has shown a flourishing trend in recent days. This is because overseas supplies have been cut off, and goods from Hong Kong have also been interrupted. Therefore, there are no incoming goods for the time being, causing people's spirits to rise. Furthermore, the influence of searching for inventory in this city has reduced the amount of circulating goods. Therefore, those holding goods see this phenomenon and are determined to keep prices high. The prices of all goods are holding very firm. Among them, tinplate (including company iron, narrow strip iron, lead, double-jointed plates, Xiao lead company iron, black iron billets, 20-gauge tinplate, 26-gauge tinplate, 90-pound and 100-pound small tinplate, and 180-pound and 200-pound tinplate, etc.) has risen the most severely. This is because factories on this street have huge demand, and Tianjin also searches from time to time. Therefore, there is a real shortage of spot goods, and opening prices continue to rise. Yesterday, 200-pound lead company iron was selling for 420 yuan per box, and lead double-jointed plates required 460 yuan.

The first exam is more difficult, and admission is stricter. Math questions seem to be the most difficult. Chinese tests include knowledge of Chinese classics and composition. Furthermore, all professors are Chinese, so English textbooks are easier to understand. Currently, classes are held at the New Gate Road campus for the university and the former Beile Road campus is now a middle school.

Soochow Overview

Next, Xu Jinfu, a student from Soochow University, introduced the school, saying that students in the school all adhere to a spirit of love, like one big family. The spirit of unity and cooperation between teachers and students is even more valuable. This is truly a major feature of Soochow. In terms of organization, Dr. Nance (文乃史博士) is currently acting president. The College of Arts (Dean Lao Shijin) has six departments: Chinese Literature, English, Political Science, Economics, (Head Jiang Chouyu), Sociology (Head Dr. William is on leave, represented by Qian Changben), and History. Renowned professors include Gao Junzhe and Yu Qingtang, and Gao Yang, Yan Jingyao, and Ying Chengyi are also well-regarded. The College of Science (Dean Pan Shenming) has four departments: Physics, Chemistry (Head Yan Yidong), Chemical Engineering (Head Sun Lingheng), Biology (Head Xu Yinqi) (including pre-med and pre-nursing). The College of Law (Dean Sheng Zhenwei) has two departments: Law and Accounting, as well as a preparatory class. Furthermore, the performance of each department in the College of Arts is quite good and generally well-regarded. The Department of Economics is considered the best in the college and currently has 180 students, the most of any department. The Department of Sociology is also very good. The Department of Biology in the College of Science is highly prestigious, and most biological materials in the country are supplied by this department. The Department of Chemical Engineering was newly established last semester and also has many students. In addition, there is a graduate school, which is the legal department of the law graduate school. As for students' extracurricular activities, they are extremely active, with the Soochow University Student YMCA, which includes twelve fellowships. There are various organizations too numerous to mention. The association also has a new student reception center to help new students solve various enrollment problems. There are also many township associations and alumni organizations. Each department also has academic organizations. Regarding the entrance examination, the school emphasizes English, and those with good English scores on the entrance exam are more likely to be admitted, especially to the College of Arts. The English test includes composition, dictation, and error correction. The Chinese test includes composition, and while classical and vernacular Chinese are both acceptable, classical Chinese is advantageous because the Chinese professors favor classical Chinese. Other test questions include adding punctuation to ancient poems and prose. The math questions are not very difficult, but the solutions must be simple. Those who take a complicated approach will not receive high scores. Those who are admitted to study biology must submit their middle school lab reports for review.

St. John's Overview

Finally, Sun Jiafu, a student from St. John's University, introduced the school, saying that dedicated study and simplicity are the school's ethos. The students are very fond of the school, which has a history of over 60 years. Furthermore, the school buildings were not affected by the war, and classes are still held on the original campus, which is well-equipped, making it a very fortunate place. In addition, the curriculum emphasizes English, and the management is strict, making it the top university in this regard. Although it is a university, classes are held all day. Boarding students must attend morning roll call, roll call again after lunch, and another roll call before bed. It is forbidden to go out after 8 p.m. The strictness of the discipline can be imagined. Many civil engineering graduates from the school are currently serving on highways in the rear. Medical graduates serve on the battlefield with the St. John's Ambulance Corps. Furthermore, the school is more internationalized, with 13 foreign professors and some foreign students. In terms of organization, there are five colleges: Arts, Science, Engineering, Medicine, and Theology. The College of Arts has seven departments: Chinese Literature, English, Education, Economics, Political Science, Journalism, and History. The College of Science has Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and a pre-medical program. Those who enter the medical college must first enter a two-year pre-medical program, for a total of seven years. Upon graduation, they become medical doctors from the University of Pennsylvania, as the medical college is a branch of that university. Furthermore, the physics department emphasizes radio, with very good results. Civil engineering emphasizes practical application. Recently, a civil engineering alumnus from the University of Michigan wrote that he felt there were very few new courses at that university, implying that he had already studied all the courses at St. John's. In addition, the civil engineering department also emphasizes highway engineering. The theology school is purely religious and has fewer students. Generally, the English department of the College of Arts is considered the best. The political science department analyzes the political systems of China, Europe, and America in great detail. Many graduates of the journalism department work for newspapers such as Ta Kung Pao. As for the entrance examination, those with excellent Chinese and English scores are more likely to be admitted. Regarding student life, the dormitories are beautiful and very comfortable. Extracurricular organizations include the Christian fellowship (which runs a night school for school workers, etc.), as well as academic research groups, such as the Chemical Society and the English Studies Society. The school authorities pay more attention to physical education and have complete facilities, but because the coursework is very busy, extracurricular activities are somewhat affected. Also, the school does not advertise for admissions. Application materials can be obtained from the school.

### New Huan No. 2 Elementary School is Not Allowed to End the Semester Early

Relevant departments order resumption of school (Dahua News Agency) The teachers and staff of the private New Huan No. 2 Elementary School on Chongqing Road in this city were unwilling to hold semester exams because the school did not issue employment contracts, and their positions were not guaranteed. The school temporarily assigned middle school students to invigilate, which led to middle and elementary school students fighting and getting injured, resulting in an announcement to end the semester early. This was followed by the strange incident of a parent beating a teacher. Details have been reported in various newspapers. According to a Dahua News Agency reporter, there has been no development in this dispute yesterday, nor any sign of a resolution. The school even notified the teachers and staff to move out of the school by the 20th of this month. Furthermore, the school submitted a request to the relevant education departments to record the early dismissal, but it was not approved. Instead, there were other instructions regarding the resolution.

### Recent News from Chengming College of Arts and Sciences

Students from various departments of Chengming College of Arts and Sciences in this city held a farewell banquet for the graduating class at the Chengdu Restaurant last week.

The round-robin matches have been going on for over three months. With the exception of the final match between Xinhua Yi and Qingyun in Group A, the championship for Group B has been won by Qingnian. The championship for Group C belongs to Zhulian Qing. It is a pity that in the women's group, both the strong teams of Hualian Women's and Youth Women's lacked competitive spirit and were defeated by the defending runner-up, Jewish, giving up the championship title.

### The Salary of a Virtuous Wife and Good Mother

— Jiang Hong

According to reports, British Home Secretary and Commander-in-Chief of the Home Front, Mr. Morrison, recently declared at a gathering of journalists, "What women did in the last war was child's play compared to what they are doing in this war. When peace is restored, all wives should be in an improved state and should no longer be engaged in floor cleaning. Husbands should give them a statutory salary from their monthly income." In this way, he has raised a rather important family issue. The point that everyone is most interested in regarding Mr. Morrison's proposal is "husbands giving wives a statutory salary."

We believe that the presentation of this point, regardless of whether it can be done in fact, has special and important significance in the spirit of gender equality and division of labor. This is because ordinary people often think that wives should manage household affairs at home. Not only do they not receive remuneration, but they are also considered parasites of their husbands, consumers rather than producers, which is actually unreasonable.

We do not advocate that women return to the family, but we believe that family work is also worthy of attention until most women have not been able to find work in society due to social environment and educational background. In spirit, family work and social work should be treated equally. We cannot simply dismiss family women as non-producers. Of course, so-called housewives who spend all day playing mahjong and idling are exceptions.

Mr. Morrison's proposal, at least in spirit, is worthy of our attention.

### The Mystery of the Disappearing Inventor

— Zuo You

In 1922, Russian engineer Miakhonine invented a new type of train.

This train was very economical, requiring neither coal nor water. It ran silently and was faster than any other vehicle, truly an unprecedented and groundbreaking invention.

The new type of vehicle was powered by electricity. The train was equipped with an oil-powered machine that could automatically generate a large amount of electricity. The train's engine had 2,000 to 3,000 horsepower and could tow the heaviest freight cars at a high speed of 100 kilometers per hour.

Miakhonine publicly demonstrated his new invention to many of the most famous scientists and engineers in the Soviet Union. He drove the new train between Moscow and Leningrad and traveled a total of 650 kilometers non-stop in eight hours. The oil consumed was only one-thirteenth of that consumed by ordinary trains.

Such a sophisticated and economical invention should have been adopted immediately, but strangely, the Soviet government only gave Miakhonine a small subsidy and asked him to continue improving his train and ordered him to go to France to recuperate. After Miakhonine went to France, he obtained a patent for his invention from the French government, and he began to negotiate with the French railway company to run his new train between Paris and Nice at a speed of 150 kilometers per hour.

At the time, the newspapers published the event, but soon after, the Russian engineer suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. Also missing were the most important oil-powered machine on his new train and the train blueprints he was carrying.

Until recently, a vague message was published in the corner of a newspaper. It is said that since Miakhonine's invention was successfully tested in the Soviet Union, huge European companies in the coal and oil industries feared that their sales of coal and oil would be greatly affected if Miakhonine's new train was adopted. Therefore, they secretly tried to prevent Miakhonine from realizing his invention. Miakhonine could not stay in the Soviet Union and had to go to France to seek development. Who knew that those companies would go a step further and use threats and inducements to force Miakhonine to hand over his machine blueprints to destroy them. At the same time, Miakhonine himself was forced to disappear.

This news is very likely to be true.

Scientific inventions are valuable gains of human wisdom, and the progress of the world and the welfare of mankind are due to the contributions of inventors. However, a small number of powerful merchants, for their own benefit, do not hesitate to lightly destroy the achievements of inventors' painstaking research. These selfish merchants are truly the most hateful obstacles to the welfare of mankind.

(9) A Strange Farmer

Because the house was built before the incident, the preparations were of course very complete. In addition to the row of houses outside being relatively poor, the interior layout was simply comparable to that of a middle-class family in the city; in this remote rural area, it was truly as magnificent as could be. Even the various utensils could almost be said to be all-inclusive, actually only lacking one thing. – That is, a mirror!

After he came out of the hospital, he secretly uncovered the gauze in that house in Tianjin and looked in the mirror once. After that, he smashed all the mirrors; when he returned to his hometown, even the nanny did not dare to bring the mirror she used herself, and she also told the Wu family on his behalf, teaching them not to let Qiu Haitang's line of sight come into contact with the mirror. Later, he didn't even want to stand in front of the washbasin to wash his face; whenever he passed by the river, he had to pick up many stones and throw them into the river one after another, so that the ripples on the river surface would not be calm, and he simply didn't have the courage to see his face again!

"What a strange farmer!" Those in the village who knew about this could not help but say this behind his back.

He continued to walk back and forth in the house, sometimes looking at Mei Bao, who was already asleep on the pit, and sometimes widening one complete eye and another wounded eye, looking around him, as if he had only moved into this bedroom today.

"How can I go to Beijing again?" In the end, he still thought so.

If it was just for the deposit, he could ask his uncle to go once, but there was still that more important thing, and Wu couldn't do it on his behalf.

He wanted to inquire in Beijing about the news of the Yuan family, uncle and nephew, and then find Luo Xiangqi, depending on the circumstances.

According to Zhao Si's letter two or three years ago, Yuan Shaowen didn't live in the army prison for a full sixteen months, and Yuan Zhenshoushi had bailed him out before the sentence expired; he had also called Zhao Si to ask about Qiu Haitang, but Qiu Haitang had never received a letter from him, and he didn't know why.

War

### The Snowman Was Stabbed

— Ke Zhong

A compulsory subject of the modern army is the use of bayonets, because in hand-to-hand combat between two armies or when both sides run out of ammunition, the purpose of destroying the other's life can only be achieved with bayonets. This is the most cruel scene, but in war, it is an unavoidable scene, so ordinary infantrymen pay great attention to the use of bayonets during training.

Usually, when practicing with bayonets, the target is usually a human figure made of straw bales or sandbags, hung on a horizontal wooden pole. However, recently the soldiers training at Fort Dix in New Jersey, USA, have had a whim and piled up snowmen to use for bayonet practice. This is both interesting and economical, which can be described as killing two birds with one stone.

### A History of Carrier Pigeons

— Jian Nong

According to the records of Pliny the Elder, a Roman natural scientist of the late 1st century AD: Ancient Egyptian and Greek sailors often used carrier pigeons to report their return dates to their families. When Caesar conquered Gaul in 58 BC, it seems that carrier pigeons were already being used in warfare. Otherwise, there is no way to explain the speed with which he transmitted orders and reported news. In 1098, during the First Crusade, Christian soldiers trapped in the fortress of Nasard near Antioch relied on carrier pigeons to communicate with Antioch. During the Third Crusade, when King Philip Augustus of France and King Richard the Lionheart of England besieged the Syrian city of Acre, the people inside the city frequently used carrier pigeons to report the battle situation to the Muslim leader Saladin. Later, in the 16th century, religious wars broke out in France. Those besieged in Paris released carrier pigeons to call for help. On the other hand, the besiegers dispatched well-trained hawks to intercept these sincere and innocent little messengers. In the early 19th century, carrier pigeons were used between Paris and London to transmit the market prices of gold and silver. The news of Napoleon I's defeat at Waterloo was also quickly transmitted to England thanks to them! Speaking of the large-scale use of carrier pigeons in history, it was during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. At that time, Paris was besieged by the Prussians and was in imminent danger. A sudden station minister thought of this method of seeking help: they used hot air balloons to send carrier pigeons out, and then released them back from all directions. However, the climate was severe at that time, and many carrier pigeons died of cold and starvation, and many were shot or captured by the Prussians. Roughly speaking, out of the four hundred carrier pigeons released from the city, only about one hundred were able to return safely. Even so, Paris received more than 150,000 official documents and more than one million private letters thanks to them! The number is truly not small.

Looking back at the records of carrier pigeons in our country, the earliest we can trace back to the "Flying Slaves" used by Zhang Jiuling, a famous Tang Dynasty prime minister, to communicate with relatives and friends in his youth in the early 8th century AD. In the National History Supplement written by Li Zhao in the early 9th century, it is recorded: "Nanhai Bo refers to foreign ships. After the ships set sail, 'sea routes' must raise white pigeons for communication. Even if the ship sinks, it can return thousands of miles." Regarding military carrier pigeons, the History of the Song Dynasty records: "During the reign of Emperor Renzong [104?], when conquering Yuan Hao, several silver mud boxes were found by the roadside. The commander Ren Fu arrived and opened them. More than a hundred domestic pigeons from a county guard post rose from within, circling above the army. Thereupon, Xia soldiers converged from all directions, and Fu fought to the death." Furthermore, there is an even more wonderful passage recorded by Zhou Mi, a Southern Song Dynasty person, in his Qi Dong Ye Yu. He said...: "Qu Duan served as the Jingyuan Regional Commander... Prince—Zhang Jun—once inspected Duan's army... there was not a single person. The Prince was surprised and wanted to conduct a roll call. Duan presented the roster of the five armies under his command, and the Prince ordered a roll call of one unit. Duan opened a cage at night and released a pigeon, and the unit being called arrived accordingly. Zhang was astonished! Later, he wanted to see all of them. So, all five pigeons were released, and the five armies gathered in an instant, their armor gleaming, and their banners shining!..." Unfortunately, no one in our country later paid attention to this matter and refined it further. Therefore, transmitting orders or news became a hardship for postal couriers and old horses!

### ### Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua's Marital Discord

— Qian Di

(Latest News) According to a current report, both parties have met face-to-face at Liu Zhonghao's house for negotiations, with Mr. Liu acting as a mediator. A reconciliation is possible. More details to follow.

The sudden marital crisis between Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua is bound to evoke endless emotions in the readers!

What exactly is going on? To understand the truth, the reporter made a special visit to Yan Hua, the party involved. Details are recorded as follows:

Early Talent Shown in Singing and Dancing

Zhou Xuan, using the name "Zhou Xiaohong," was introduced to the Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe led by Li Jinhui by a man named Zhang Wen when she was thirteen years old. At that time, Yan Hua was also working as an actor. It was due to this opportunity that they first met. Later, "Bright Moon" disbanded, and "Xinhua" was established. Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua also transferred to this song and dance troupe. Yan Hua was very knowledgeable in music and often taught her singing and dancing, and urged her to study hard. Their love was cultivated in this way. Soon, Zhou Xuan's name became greatly renowned. She, Bai Hong, Wang Renmei, and Li Jiaohui simultaneously emerged in the entertainment industry and were ranked as the "Four Great Singers."

Gaining Fame in the Film Industry

Yan Hua played a significant role in Zhou Xuan's entry into the film industry and her current status. In the summer of 1928, due to their compatible wills, they held a wedding ceremony in Xicang An Street, Beiping, presided over by both parents, and formally became husband and wife. The following year, they came to Shanghai and had a son, who died in a miscarriage. After the marriage, their relationship was quite good. They worked hard together for their careers without懈怠. In less than a year, Zhou Xuan gradually became popular, while Yan Hua concentrated on Industry (In addition to co-founding the Shanghai Harmonica Factory with friends, he also serves as the sales director of Far East Steel Needle Manufacturing Co., Ltd.). In his spare time, one composed music, and the other recorded for record companies.

Good Times Don't Last; Sudden Departure

However, such an ideal couple has now suddenly and strangely separated. The night before she left, Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua even watched "One Night of Ecstasy" together at the Great Light Theater. They did not have any quarrels on the way back, so the outbreak of this incident was truly unexpected. On the evening of the sixteenth, Yan Hua returned home at ten o'clock and did not see Zhou Xuan. He thought that the filming of the drama "Late at Night" had just finished, and maybe she was watching a screening at Jincheng, so he naturally had no doubts. Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, one o'clock, and finally, at one thirty, Zhou Xuan still hadn't returned, which made Yan Hua suspicious. He hurriedly took a car to Liu Zhonghao's residence, but he was very disappointed and did not see Zhou Xuan. Liu Zhonghao comforted him and said, "Go back first, don't worry, we'll think of a solution tomorrow morning." After he returned home, he discovered that three deposit slips had been stolen, including two from "Xinhua", one under the name "Zhou Xuan," with an amount of 10,000 yuan, and one under the name "Xia Hongmin," also with an amount of 10,000 yuan. These were all fixed deposits. There was also one from "Jincheng," which was a current account, with an amount of 6,000 yuan. He couldn't sleep that night and sat up all night until dawn.

Fruitless Search; Warning Issued

The next morning (the day before yesterday), he first went to various hotels, including the International and Paramount, to look for her, but there was no news. He went to the Taikoo Wharf and searched the Taiyuan Wheel, but it was also empty. He returned dejectedly, not knowing what to do. Later, Liu Zhonghao called and told him, "Zhou Xuan left a letter for me, saying that she wants to divorce you. What are your thoughts?" Yan Hua's hands trembled, as if he had stepped into emptiness. Liu Zhonghao then said, "Zhou Xuan has hired Lawyer Lu Weibin to handle everything. Come here at six o'clock tonight, and we'll think of a solution together." He hung up the phone before he finished speaking. After returning, he talked to friends and relatives, who all advised him to calm down. However, he really couldn't bear it any longer, so he had to ask Lawyer Chen Chengyin to resolve this matter.

Tearful Words; Heartbreaking Sentiments

This is the story of Zhou Xuan's departure. Finally, Yan Hua, with tears in his eyes, made a statement to the reporter. He said, "I love Zhou Xuan, and Zhou Xuan must also love me. Our love is built on our careers. Now that we are separated, how can I endure it? There were usually some quarrels between us, but why did it come to divorce? I will always love her, and my love will never change until death."

Objective Stance; Sincere Advice

I have recorded this fact from an objective standpoint. Now I will also say a few words from an objective standpoint. I believe that one should always think before acting and not be swayed by temporary emotional impulses. Zhou Xuan is a smart person, and Yan Hua is also a smart person. Both of them should examine themselves and make concessions. I hope that this turmoil can be quickly calmed down, and I also hope that they can reconcile and jointly advance towards their careers!

(Another Dispatch) It is rumored that Zhou Xuan's departure was due to a love affair with Han Fei (a member of the Shanghai Drama Society and an actor with Guohua). That is absolutely false. Han Fei is a young artist with a very clear mind and would never blindly fall in love with a married woman. Moreover, the fact that Zhou Xuan has been residing at the home of Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guohua, since she left can serve as proof. Even Yan Hua's sister Yan Fei and his nephew Yan Jun did not know about the incident after it happened, which shows how sudden it was.

Now, Zhou Xuan has also hired a Lawyer Lu Weibin to negotiate with Yan Hua, refuting Yan Hua's announcement in yesterday's newspaper. Indeed, Yan Hua's announcement has caused considerable damage to Zhou Xuan's reputation.

Standing in the position of a third party, the writer hopes that both parties can express themselves with a faithful and frank attitude to maintain their past feelings. Otherwise, the result of legal disputes will inevitably lead to a painful tragedy.

Chapter 11: A Heroic Figure Comes to Fight Fiercely

The dust rose higher and higher, followed by many banners, redder than half the sky, from far to near, and soon iron cavalry swept across, with hundreds of bandits riding horses towards the river. Behind them were infantry, like bees gathering ants, reaching the river. Upstream, there were a dozen or so sailboats sailing downstream, with flags bearing the character "Wen" inserted, which were naturally also bandits. Xu Jing watched the bandits advancing by land and water, their arrogance being far greater than that of the bandits from Qingshi Mountain who had previously attacked Qixian County, and couldn't help but feel secretly alarmed. Wang Yongtai was just secretly peeking forward, not saying a word. He saw the bandits building a pontoon bridge over the Xiaolong River. The mounted bandits crossed the river first, followed by the infantry, who were disorganized and lacked order. After the cavalry crossed the river, thousands of hooves galloped past in front of the forest, half a li away, unaware that there was an ambush of government troops hidden here. Wang Yongtai waited until the mounted bandits had passed and the infantry had only half-crossed the river. Unwilling to miss this great opportunity, he hurriedly turned his head and made a gesture to Xu Jing. Immediately, he fell from the tree. Xu Jing dared not delay and jumped to the ground, each taking up arms and mounting their warhorses. Wang Yongtai took out a signal cannon from his pocket, lit it, and with a thud, the ambushing soldiers in the entire forest heard it. Immediately, each prepared and, following Wang Yongtai, shouted and charged out of the forest. Wang Yongtai took the lead, holding his serpent spear high, charging猛 towards the bandit ranks. Xu Jing, seeing Wang Yongtai's mighty spirit, doubled his courage and followed closely behind, attacking together. The five hundred cavalry soldiers behind them swept past like mountains and seas, immediately dividing the bandits into two parts, unable to attend to both ends. Wang Yongtai swung his serpent spear, like a monstrous python. Several bandits in front of him were pierced through the chest or throat, falling from their horses one after another. Xu Jing thrust his　fiercely, and he also stabbed to death three or four. The soldiers under his command all fought as one against ten, shouting and charging. The bandits, caught off guard, immediately collapsed. A mounted pseudo-general, with a red turban wrapped around his head, raised a broadsword to fight Wang Yongtai. In less than seven or eight rounds, Wang Yongtai speared him off his horse. Several pseudo-generals夹迎戰, Wang Yongtai 一剌五挑, and in an instant, killed three more. The bandits saw Wang Yongtai's　beard fluttering, his old face like fire, and his eyes shining brightly. Knowing his strength, they were all terrified and fled towards the Xiaolong River behind them. This fierce battle had wiped out half of the bandits crossing the river, and many others drowned. The bandits quickly retreated, recognizing the power of the Datong government army. (93)
