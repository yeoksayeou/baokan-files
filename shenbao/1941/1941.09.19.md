Chongqing: On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a broadcast speech here. In his speech, Chairman Chiang declared that China would not stop fighting until the northeastern territories were recovered. He also declared that if Japan continues to occupy the Northeast, it would be a great danger to the world and would violate the eight principles recently announced by Roosevelt and Churchill. He said that China would never want to divide its own territory, nor would we want to abandon the rich resources of the Northeast, allowing the enemy to benefit from them and threaten the world, and undermine China. Finally, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese War must be resolved simultaneously with the European war, and there is no reason for a separate resolution.

Chongqing, Eighteenth, International News Service: Yesterday was the eve of the tenth anniversary of the Mukden Incident. Last night, General Chiang Kai-shek broadcast to the entire nation of China, saying, "Resistance will not cease as long as a single invader remains in our country." After stating the purpose of resistance, Chiang asked the people of China not to forget that although the northeastern provinces are temporarily lost, no Chinese territory is actually separated from China. He said, "We will survive together or perish together." In recalling the Mukden Incident, General Chiang said that Japan's intention to conquer Manchuria and Mongolia, and then conquer the world, has long been known to the world. Therefore, under the leadership of Roosevelt and Hull, the United States has shifted from a policy of non-recognition to economic sanctions and expanded aid to China. He also said, "We fight for the independence and survival of the Chinese nation and the integrity of our administration and land, so that we can be free from the threats we now face and that China can enjoy freedom and equality in the East and in a world that can be called just and peaceful. I deeply believe that the nations opposing Japan will intensify their encirclement of Japan, and I further believe that the final failure of Japan is about to begin. Today, commemorating the dark era of ten years ago can inspire us."

Tokyo, Eighteenth, Haitong News Agency: Asahi Shimbun reports that a report from Hong Kong says that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has sent a letter to U.S. President Roosevelt, detailing the important role that China's war effort plays between the democracies and the Axis powers. He also expressed great concern about any solution to the Pacific issue and therefore wishes to be informed of the progress of U.S.-Japan talks at any time.

### Fighting in Southwestern Area of Dayun Mountain Comes to an End: Japanese Withdraw Troops, Attempting Complete Destruction; Chinese Troops Are Carrying Out Post-War Work

Somewhere: Chinese troops swept the Japanese forces in the southwestern area of Dayun Mountain on the north bank of the upper reaches of the Xinqiang River. After days of bloody fighting, it has come to an end. The scattered Japanese troops in the area have all been eliminated. On the seventeenth, Chinese troops are engaged in post-war work such as clearing the battlefield and comforting refugees. This was because the main force of a certain Japanese division invaded southward from northern Hunan, with the aim of covering the withdrawal of troops, and attempting to inflict a fatal blow on the Chinese troops before the withdrawal of troops, reducing the threat to the periphery of Yuezhou. Chinese troops used the principle of magnetic warfare to attract the Japanese troops, fought bloodily for ten days, not only causing the main force of a certain Japanese division to be almost completely lost, but also completely crushing the Japanese attempt to withdraw troops.

### Gu Weijun Delivers Important Speech

London: Chinese Ambassador to Britain Gu Weijun delivered a speech at a luncheon of the New Commonwealth Society here today, asking that the Far Eastern situation not be ignored when drafting any permanent peace plan. He said, "The current situation seems to focus on the European aspects of general problems. I feel slightly uneasy about this concentration on maintaining peace in Europe. The terrible torrent in the West today is not unrelated to what happened in the Far East ten years ago. Failure to curb the violence and disturbances against the peace-loving Chinese people undoubtedly encouraged the forces of aggression in Europe." (Eighteenth Reuters dispatch)

### Myanmar to Australia Forms Arc-Shaped Line: Brooke-Popham Discusses Cooperation Between Britain and the Dutch East Indies; Sufficient to Cope with Any Future Contingency

Singapore, 78th, Reuters: British Commander-in-Chief in the Far East Brooke-Popham and British Fleet Commander in China Leighton held a joint press conference yesterday. Brooke-Popham claimed that the British side was not concerned about the threat of a blockade, as there were sufficient food and munitions. He did not believe that a blockade could last for six months, but even without the help of the U.S. Navy, the British side would be able to completely break it before six months. When asked about his recent tour of the Dutch East Indies, Brooke-Popham replied that as far as he could see, the Dutch East Indies were well prepared and very satisfactory. The Dutch East Indies certainly did not want to trample on civilian crops, but if attacked, the Dutch East Indies would be determined to make a statement and would not give in. When asked whether the British and the Dutch East Indies had held staff talks or made any arrangements, Brooke-Popham replied that he had said at the last press conference that from Myanmar to Australia, an arc had been formed with shared interests. If an incident occurred in one place in this area, other places would also be affected, as these countries were inseparable. "I have said all I can say, and I cannot continue to elaborate." When asked whether Malaya would immediately rise up to help if the Dutch East Indies were attacked, Brooke-Popham replied that he would follow the orders of the British government and that, thanks to Duff Cooper's efforts, the British government would make a rapid decision. When asked about Thailand, Brooke-Popham said that the relationship between Malaya and Thailand was now better than before. Thailand now knew that we were its friends and therefore hoped that we would provide guidance and send two military officers to inspect our defenses and the work of our fighter squadrons. This was something he thought impossible a few months ago. Thailand has begun to show a kind of independence towards Japan, and they are gradually realizing that they should not be too economically or financially dependent on Japan. Rear Admiral Leighton told reporters that the rumor broadcast by radio that a pirate ship had been found in the Pacific and had destroyed many ships was untrue.

Canberra, Eighteenth, Reuters: Australian Prime Minister Fadden warned the people not to become complacent because the main war damage may continue to be far away from Australia in a few weeks or months, as the shift of war damage is only temporary. The Australian Prime Minister also said that the Australian government recognized that the mutual adjustment of British and American Far Eastern policies was extremely important. He believed that there had been no fundamental changes in the situation in the past month, and Australians must continue to prepare to prevent sudden changes in the war and force Australians to actively defend themselves near their own coastline. Australia has formally invited Duff Cooper to set up headquarters in Singapore and visit Australia as soon as possible to the extent possible.

### Japanese Military Department Issues Article Commemorating "September 18th": Actually Positions Itself as Leader; Exposes Ambition to Dominate

Tokyo, Eighteenth, United Press: Officials of the Japanese Army Ministry recently issued an article stating that the Manchurian Incident and the current Sino-Japanese War are both "racial wars" with the aim of liberating Eastern races and allowing them to escape the oppression of white people. The official said in the article that Japan is the leader of the Eastern races, and therefore Japan has decided to fight to the end. The Japanese "Kochiho," which often reflects the opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published this article in a prominent position. The author of this article is Fuminaga, director of the press department of the Army Ministry, which was written to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Manchurian Incident. Fuminaga criticized the so-called ABCD "aggressive front" for increasingly tightening its encirclement of Japan, and said that in order to realize the "New Order in East Asia," it is necessary for Japan to obtain raw materials from the Dutch East Indies. "If any country forces the Dutch East Indies to reject Japan's legitimate demands and stop transporting raw materials, this move will become a serious issue related to Japan's survival. Japan will one day make them understand the folly of their plans. The glorious history and mission of the Yamato nation will never allow its country to remain in a position of being restricted and economically oppressed. It will not allow any situation to exist that would cause Japan to be economically impoverished to death." Fuminaga also said that the victory of the China Incident can build a larger "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and allow the Japanese people to engage in the greatest undertaking. Fuminaga also said that he believes that "our country's national strength and military power will never be overthrown and will remain very stable and suitable for a great power. Today is the time for Japan to move forward and break through any obstacles in its path."

Tokyo, Eighteenth, United Press: The "Asahi Shimbun" today, on the tenth anniversary of the start of the Manchurian Incident, criticized the anti-Axis countries for aiding the Chinese government in an attempt to delay the China Incident, thereby deliberately hindering peace in East Asia. The newspaper said, "Their formation of an encirclement front is intended to coerce us." The newspaper said that the current possible crisis is the most serious since withdrawing from the League of Nations. The "Kokumin Shimbun" advocated that the reasons for the Mukden Incident must be re-recognized and said, "We must revitalize our fighting spirit to cope with the current situation so as to eliminate the causes of future difficulties and disputes."

### Bank of England Re-elects Directors; Governor Will Not Change

London, Eighteenth, Reuters: At a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of England today, Governor Norman announced that the positions of Governor and Deputy Governor of the Bank would not change in April next year.

### American Announces Implementation of Convoy Escorts

In response to Nazi provocations at sea, U.S. President Roosevelt announced in a broadcast on the evening of the 11th that he had ordered the U.S. Navy to shoot at Axis vessels when they appeared in the U.S. defense waters, to protect all American and other national vessels doing business in U.S. defense waters from attacks by submarines and surface raiders. This already constitutes a de facto convoy escort, although he did not explicitly use the word "convoy." However, the night before, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox, in a conversation with reporters, formally announced the U.S. Navy's implementation of convoy escorts to ensure the safe arrival of supplies for Britain. This is a further step toward war for the United States, following the passage of the Lend-Lease Act and the expansion of the patrol system.

The consistent policy of the United States regarding the current European war is to ensure that war materials reach Britain to promote British victory, while avoiding direct participation in the war itself. Among these two conditions, the former is absolute, and all possible means will be taken to ensure its fulfillment; the latter is relative, and the attitude will be determined by the objective situation at any time. If there is a real necessity, avoiding participation is not an absolutely unshakeable principle. A year ago, opposition to joining the war did indeed have great influence in the United States, so that President Roosevelt had to specially emphasize the principle of avoiding involvement in the war in his fireside chat at the end of last year and in his State of the Union address at the beginning of this year. In the course of this year, from aiding Britain to expanding patrols to implementing convoy escorts, approaching the brink of war step by step, the voices against joining the war have become increasingly silenced. Even those who stubbornly cling to the old ways, like Colonel Lindbergh, are not enough to stir up public opinion. This major change is naturally due to the efforts of the U.S. authorities and the people's awareness, but the biggest reason is still the Nazis' aggressive and encroaching nature, which leaves no room for isolationist and pacifist views. Moreover, although Britain has suffered defeats, its strength remains intact. In terms of the current international situation, there is already considerable confidence in principle in defeating the Nazis. Although the United States is increasingly increasing its obligations and responsibilities for the European war, it is very different from having to seek positive action because of the collapse of British power. This is why the convoy action can be announced and implemented so smoothly without any resistance.

Since Roosevelt announced his determination to clear Axis warships appearing in U.S. territorial waters, the Axis side has been constantly furious, but the repeated attacks on American ships that had occurred before have temporarily disappeared. On the other hand, until now, there has been no news of Axis warships being sunk or captured by the U.S. escort fleet. If the calm situation in the Atlantic these days is not accidental, then it is probably because the Nazis have recognized the difficulty and retreated under the firm response of the U.S. side. In April and May of this year, Germany's raiding policy did have some effect in the Atlantic for a time, with a record of sinking more than 400,000 tons of British ships per week (according to German figures), and it was rumored that 40% of American war supplies to Britain were sunk on the bottom of the Atlantic. However, according to British Prime Minister Churchill's report in the House of Commons on the 9th of this month, the situation in the Atlantic has greatly improved. On the one hand, the loss of British and Allied ships has greatly decreased, and on the other hand, the loss of German and Italian ships in June, July, and August has increased sharply. In July and August, the number of British and Allied ships sunk by German attacks was less than one-third of the number of German and Italian ships lost to British aircraft and submarines. According to this, Germany's raiding strength at sea should be insufficient to cope with Britain, let alone the addition of the vast U.S. fleet. The warships currently used by the United States for convoy escorts in the Atlantic are probably mainly the Atlantic Fleet that previously performed patrol missions, totaling more than 120 warships. Except for three old battleships and four heavy cruisers, about two-thirds or more are light destroyers and submarines, plus the cooperation of the air force, which is precisely configured to deal with German raiding. According to U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox the night before last, convoy methods are constantly changing, and the United States is now fully adopting these new methods. Even if Germany's submarine and aircraft production is amazing, it is difficult to cultivate talent. In the midst of its own encirclement, it is unwise to arbitrarily consume a large amount of strength under the joint guard of the British and American navies and air forces, and in reality cannot achieve the effect of cutting off American war supplies to Britain. Therefore, it is expected that after the U.S. Navy implements convoy escorts, the raiding operations in the Atlantic will not disappear completely, but they will not be a cause for concern. Unless there are more significant changes, the United States can still continue to maintain its traditional policy of avoiding direct participation in the war.

If the German side's intensification of attacks on American transport ships in recent days was to disrupt the U.S.-Japan negotiations and coerce Japan to express its attitude toward its Axis alliance obligations, then this intention can be said to have completely failed. The U.S.-Japan negotiations will certainly not have any results, but that is not due to the disruptive power of the Germans. Furthermore, Japan's recent lukewarm attitude toward the Tripartite Pact cannot be reversed by any German posture unless Germany wins a decisive victory. From this point alone, there is no need for the Nazi attacks on American ships to continue to expand.

### Knox Officially Announces U.S. Navy Implementation of Convoy Escorts to Ensure the Safe Transport of Supplies to Britain; German Raiders' Activities Under Search

Reuters, Washington, 18th - The U.S. Navy is now adopting convoy methods to ensure the safe transport of supplies to Britain, as announced by Secretary of the Navy Knox last night. Knox told reporters that naval convoy escorts are just one of the many methods available and currently used. Since the last great war, more convoy methods have been invented, and the United States is now fully adopting them. When asked if U.S. warships escort ships to Iceland and hand them over to the British Navy there, Knox replied that it would be unwise to speak in detail about this matter.

United Press, Washington, 18th - Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox told reporters yesterday that the United States will protect ships of any nationality carrying supplies provided under the Lend-Lease Act. Colonel Knox also said that the Navy Department believes that a German raider is operating along the Panama Canal in the South Pacific, and this ship is apparently using the Galapagos Islands as a base. Colonel Knox replied to inquiries, "We believe that there must be a raider there, and a ship is missing. This is our only information." He said that the Navy Department had searched the Pacific islands several months ago for islands that could be used as raider bases. He said that the Navy Department is still continuing to search the islands off South America for possible raider bases. Regarding convoy escorts, Knox told questioners, "You can still recall that since the First World War, many other new methods besides convoy escorts have been invented to protect ships. We have used all these new methods." Knox refused to say whether the Navy Department also protects all merchant ships in the North Atlantic, but he admitted that the possibility of arming merchant ships is being officially discussed. However, he also stated that Congress will be required to pass this measure, and he himself has not yet decided. Colonel Knox admitted that the lack of guns is the main problem regarding the arming of merchant ships. Knox said that naval guns and sailors can be used when needed. Colonel Knox also said that in recent days, there have been no reports of conflicts with German aircraft. When asked whether the Navy Department also provides convoy escorts for ships carrying war materials to Britain and Iceland, Knox replied, "Convoy escorts with warships are one of all methods. This method will be used in all our defense areas."

### U.S. Loans Large Sum to Soviet Union, 100 Million Gold Dollars for Purchasing War Materials

Reuters, Washington, 18th - The United States is now providing the Soviet Union with 100 million U.S. dollars to purchase war materials in the United States.

Reuters, Washington, 18th - Federal Loan Administrator Jones released President Roosevelt's letter regarding the Soviet loan as follows: The Soviet government now needs U.S. dollars to purchase war materials in the United States. We now need many types of raw materials produced by the Soviet Union that are critical to the military. In peacetime, we used to import some from that country. Now, to help the Soviet government pay for the war materials it wants to purchase in the United States, and now we can only obtain a limited amount of the price of goods, and to facilitate our security procedures, I now wish you to purchase manganese, chromium, asbestos, platinum, and other items and raw materials from the Soviet Amtorg Corporation through the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation or one of its subsidiary organizations, up to 100 million U.S. dollars, and deliver the goods as soon as possible. Those who need subsidies for transportation and convenience of production should be given an appropriate amount, and 50 million U.S. dollars can be prepaid to offset the price of purchasing these raw materials critical to the military, so that the Soviet Union can use them to purchase various goods in the United States. Jones told reporters that the Defense Supplies Corporation, assisted by the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation, yesterday signed a contract with Amtorg Corporation to purchase 100 million U.S. dollars worth of manganese, chromium, asbestos, and platinum. He also said that the Defense Supplies Corporation will prepay 50 million U.S. dollars for the price of these raw materials, so that the Soviet Union can use them to purchase various goods in the United States. Ten million U.S. dollars have been paid out yesterday according to the contract, and the remaining funds will be paid at any time when the Soviet Union needs them.

### Nazi Spy Case Opens in U.S.; Sebold's Testimony

Reuters, New York, 18th - German-American spy Paul Sebold testified yesterday during the court trial of the Nazi spy network that five months before the U.S. occupied Iceland, a German agent had told him that the U.S. would send 30,000 troops and 4,000 officers to Greenland and Iceland. He also said that most of the funds Germany sent to the U.S. to support spies were intercepted by the U.S. Bureau of Investigation, so spies in the U.S. earned very little. Investigator Friedman testified that he had eavesdropped on conversations between Duquesne and Sebold. Duquesne wanted to blow up a General Electric plant somewhere in New York State. Duquesne himself said that he had inspected the plant a year ago and felt that it was best to blow it up with a bomb made of lead pipes, using slow-burning gunpowder fuse, because it was silent. The Bureau of Investigation secretly filmed up to 200 feet of film to show Duquesne's situation in Sebold's office. Note that Duquesne is one of the defendants, a native of Cape Town, South Africa, who has become a U.S. citizen and claims to be an internationally renowned writer and speaker.

### Soviet Forces Achieve Major Victory Northeast of Smolensk; Battle for Leningrad Becomes More Cautious and Intense; German Offensive in South Again Defeated

Reuters, Moscow, 18th - Soviet forces launched a fierce counterattack and drove back the Axis forces attacking Odessa. The Soviet news agency announced this, saying that the Axis forces attacking Odessa broke through the Soviet lines and occupied several heights west of Darnia. Soviet infantry, assisted by Soviet warships, launched a counterattack. After fierce fighting for several hours, the heights changed hands several times, but the German forces were finally driven back to their original positions, abandoning many dead and wounded German soldiers.

Reuters, London, 18th - Soviet forces have recently achieved major victories in Yazhivo, 35 miles northeast of Smolensk, and Odessa on the Black Sea coast. In the Leningrad area, German forces have intensified their pressure, while Soviet forces are fiercely resisting on land, sea, and air, and the battle situation is becoming more intense. A recent dispatch from Moscow described the Red Army recovering a village at a crossroads leading to Leningrad. It is said that German forces intended to launch a new offensive from this village. Soviet land forces, assisted by the firing of Soviet warships, rushed into the village regardless of their own safety. The fighting was very fierce, and the village was finally recaptured. German forces suffered heavy losses. Now, fresh German troops are being sent to the front line and concentrating artillery fire to break through the resistance of the Leningrad defenders. There is also fighting off the Gulf of Finland, far from Leningrad. German forces have repeatedly attempted to occupy the island of Osel and other islands controlling the southern entrances to the Gulf of Riga and the Gulf of Finland. It is generally believed that the Soviet victory in Yazhivo, killing 10,000 enemies and capturing many artillery pieces, is extremely important, because the Soviet forces are thus able to surround Smolensk and defeat the German hope of continuing to attack Moscow from this area. Soviet forces in the Ukrainian region launched a fierce counterattack and drove back the Axis forces by several miles.

International News Service, Moscow, 18th - The good news of the Soviet forces' overall victory has just been reported, and yesterday it was announced again that a village near Leningrad, which German forces intended to use as an elastic springboard to directly attack Leningrad, had been recaptured by Soviet forces after fierce fighting. Official reports said that as a result of the Soviet forces' fierce attack, German forces suffered more than 30,000 casualties. Marshal Moshenko's troops in the central area have recaptured Yazhivo, 30 miles north of Smolensk, and are now preparing to recapture Smolensk to eliminate the German threat to Moscow. A Soviet spokesman said that the German attacks on Leningrad and Odessa are very urgent, which shows that the German forces are eager to succeed in at least one place before winter. The Soviet High Command said that another German force attempted to land on Osel Island, but were all repelled by the Soviet Navy and buried in the Baltic Sea. The control of the Gulf of Finland is still in Soviet hands.

### German Side Claims to be Approaching Leningrad; Fierce Artillery Fire Shakes Heaven and Earth

German infantry and shock troops have bravely advanced to capture enemy positions. Enemy artillery batteries and fortresses are under heavy artillery fire. German forces are passing through areas defended by mines and barbed wire, throwing hand grenades at the enemy. The fighting is in full swing.

United Press, Helsinki, 18th - Finnish sources say that the entire Leningrad area is under German artillery fire and air raids. The fire can be seen from 30 miles away. It is said that the Soviet naval base of Kronstadt is billowing black smoke into the sky. According to the Finnish side, the Kronstadt artillery has not fired for more than two days.

### Bulgaria Makes Request to Turkey; Permission for Warships to Pass Through Straits; Turkey Will Certainly Reject It

United Press, Ankara, 18th - Bulgaria has requested Turkey to allow Bulgaria to pass eight destroyers, four submarines, and one torpedo boat through the Dardanelles Strait.

Reuters, London, 18th - The British government has no definite confirmation regarding the rumors that Bulgaria has been asked to allow Italian warships to pass through the Dardanelles under the Bulgarian flag. According to information obtained by a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the British view is already very clear, that any such attempt would be a means to undermine the provisions of the Montreux Convention. Although Britain is not at war with Bulgaria, the Axis powers cannot invoke the non-belligerent clause in the Montreux Convention, because Bulgaria has at least been genuinely fighting with Greece and Yugoslavia, two of Britain's allies. Therefore, there is no reason to doubt that the Turkish government will firmly reject it.

### Soviet Union Expresses Dissatisfaction with Bulgaria's Reply; Families of Soviet Embassy Staff Withdraw from Sofia

TASS, Moscow, 18th - On the 17th, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov met with Bulgarian Envoy to the Soviet Union Staminov. During the conversation, the Bulgarian Envoy handed Molotov a reply from the Bulgarian government. In the reply, the Bulgarian government denied the facts protested by the Soviet government, and also denied that Bulgaria was disloyal to the Soviet Union and that Bulgaria was used as a base for attacking the Soviet Union. Molotov told the Bulgarian Envoy that the Soviet Union was not satisfied with the Bulgarian government's reply, because the reply did not refute the points raised in the Soviet note.

International News Service, London, 18th - According to a German border dispatch published in this morning's "Daily Express," Turkey is in a "position to be invaded by Germany," because Hitler urgently needs oil and needs a shortest route to the Caucasus oil fields of the Soviet Union. The same news also said that another 330,000 Bulgarian soldiers have been called up for military service. It also said that the families of 50 staff members of the Soviet Embassy in Bulgaria have left Sofia for Istanbul.

### Nazis Invade Soviet Union; Revised Timetable; Expected to Reach Caucasus in Six Weeks

### British Policy Towards Turkey: Loyalty to Alliance Unwavering; Increased Trade Relations Between the Two Countries; Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen Delivers Speech

Reuters, Ankara, 18th. British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, delivered a speech yesterday at the Izmir Fair. The audience included the Mayor of Izmir, Turkish military and civilian authorities, business leaders, consular officials, and expatriates from Allied countries. The Ambassador stated that the Anglo-Turkish alliance will always be the foundation of British policy towards Turkey. During his first year in Turkey, he had said that Britain's commercial and financial policy towards Turkey was a long-term policy. Today, he believes this statement has been validated and can guarantee that it will prove to be accurate in the future. Despite facing various difficulties and dedicating all its efforts to the greatest struggle in history to fight for the freedom of its own country and the entire world, Britain is still participating in this fair. The best illustration of Britain's trade policy towards Turkey can be seen in the figures for British purchases from Turkey in 1938, 1939, and 1940. The total value of British purchases from Turkey in these three years was £2,817,000, £6,387,000, and £35,402,000 Turkish pounds, respectively. This does not include purchases made from Turkey by British private merchants. In the past few weeks alone, British goods worth £10,000,000 have been shipped to Turkey. Britain plans to purchase olive oil, wool, dried fruits, and other goods worth £20,000,000. There is also an agreement between Britain and Turkey for Britain to provide gold to meet Turkey's needs. From the sales figures, it is clear that Britain is truly committed to increasing trade with Turkey. This trade is not temporary or transitional or due to the war, but a foundation for permanent mutual relations. He believes that Anglo-Turkish trade will continue to increase.

### Three Swedish Destroyers Experience Mysterious Explosion; Fuel Spreads on Water Surface, City Ablaze; Over Forty Dead and Injured; Cause Under Thorough Investigation

United Press, Stockholm, 18th. On Tuesday, three Swedish destroyers berthed at the Muskö naval base were bombed, caught fire, and sank. It is reported that 31 people died and 11 were injured. However, after the incident, burning oil from the fire spread across the harbor's surface, creating a sea of flames, making rescue impossible. The number of deaths is feared to be higher. The three destroyers sunk were the "Gothenburg," displacing 1,040 tons, the "Klas Horn," displacing 1,020 tons, and the "Klas Uggla," displacing 1,020 tons. When the three ships met with disaster, many of the 600 crew members were on leave and spared. It is believed the explosions were caused either by careless handling of torpedoes or an accident in the boiler room.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 18th. Yesterday's tragedy involving the Swedish destroyers is an unprecedented military catastrophe in Sweden during peacetime. The Swedish destroyer "Gothenburg" in Hårsfjärden suddenly exploded, and nearby warships were also affected. Explosions occurred one after another within half an hour, and the arsenal on the nearby island of Mälsten was also engulfed in flames. Soldiers on the island temporarily took refuge in air-raid shelters. The first explosion on the "Gothenburg" broke the ship into two sections, and it immediately sank. The fire spread to nearby warships, including the cruisers "Klas Horn," "Klas Uggla," and the minelayer "Fleming," which were damaged. One transport ship was also destroyed.

International News Service, Stockholm, 18th. The government is investigating the cause of the explosion of the three destroyers. Officials are currently silent on the matter, as the government fears it may involve international relations.

### Former German Finance Minister Dies in France

### New Iranian King Sworn In; Adopts Constitutional Monarchy; British and Soviet Troops Enter Tehran

Reuters, London, 18th. A BBC correspondent in Delhi stated that British troops have entered the Iranian capital, Tehran. Moscow Radio also announced that Soviet troops have entered the city. Staff officers from both British and Soviet forces entered the city yesterday morning. It is reported that some Soviet troops parachuted in. The new Iranian King was sworn into office yesterday afternoon in parliament, taking an oath to the constitution. His first act after taking office was to comply with the wishes of the former king and order the dismissal of the police chief, as he had tried his best to obstruct the arrest of German nationals. The first group of Germans being sent to India for detention have reportedly boarded ships at a certain port in the Persian Gulf. The Bulgarian embassy in Tehran has been closed. The new king will formally receive all diplomatic personnel in Tehran in the coming days.

Reuters, Tehran, 18th. Iranian Prime Minister Foroughi declared in parliament yesterday that Allied troops were advancing towards Tehran. The Iranian government requested that they not approach the capital, hoping this request would be effective. However, even if Allied troops reach the capital, members of parliament should be at ease, as the Allied troops have no hostile intentions. This is the assurance that the Allied troops have given us, and we deeply believe that this assurance can be trusted. The Prime Minister also stated that the new king had instructed him to explain that the new king would rule Iran under a completely constitutional monarchy. The new king will abide by the constitution, respect the rights of the Iranian people, obey all laws that have been passed or will be passed by parliament, and will do his best to correct any individual or collective misdeeds against the people. The new king will also try to fulfill all the hopes of the people and will grant parliament all facilities to establish a committee of experts to verify his guarantee that the royal jewelry is safely stored in the National Bank of Tehran.

Nationwide Resentment; The Former King's Abdication

Reuters, Tehran, 17th. Iranian King Reza Shah, who reigned for 16 years, ruled with administrative autocracy, nearly resulting in a popular uprising. He was eventually forced to abdicate due to the demands of the people. Although senior military officers, due to their positions and benefits, still considered supporting him, the soldiers resented him, and the people were divided. When cabinet members entered the palace on Monday night to request his abdication, Reza Shah refused, hoping that the army could help him and that the British and Soviets would not intervene. He later sent someone to meet with British Ambassador Bullard to seek his opinion. After learning that the British side would not provide assistance, he realized that his power was gone. On Tuesday, he summoned cabinet members to the Winter Palace and presented them with the abdication edict. The matter was initially kept secret to prevent unrest, but the news spread throughout the capital. Countless people gathered in front of the radio to listen to the official announcement. After his abdication, Reza Shah set off for Isfahan, a city 220 miles to the south, which is a center of ancient Persian art and culture. The wealth that Reza Shah had accumulated over the years was considerable. Some of it had already been shipped to the United States and Britain, and it is not yet known whether he will take the rest with him.

British Troops Control Iran; Strengthen Position in the Near East

Reuters, London, 18th. German newspapers have recently acknowledged that it was foolish to underestimate Britain's victory in Iran.

The Air Ministry's Information Office stated that the Marcin-Gaillard power plant is quite important, as it not only has a large power station but also manufactures synthetic oil and ammonia.

### Two Columns of German Troops Cross Border, Invade Egyptian Territory

Repulsed to Original Position After Fierce Attack by South African Troops; Cairo Air Raid Incites Muslim Resentment

Reuters, Cairo, 18th. Two columns of German troops crossed the border and entered 35 miles into Egyptian territory for reconnaissance, but were forced to retreat. They were pursued by South African armored vehicles and British troops. The German troops have now retreated to their original positions. British and South African patrols are currently in contact with them. This is the first time that South African troops have engaged Axis forces since arriving in Egypt.

Reuters, Cairo, 18th. The Egyptian Minister of Defense formally announced last night that Cairo was subjected to an air raid on Tuesday morning, stating that the Axis powers' bombing of Cairo has caused deep resentment among Egyptians and Muslims worldwide, as Muslims regard Cairo as a holy city holding the torch of Islam. I believe that the monuments and sacred religious tombs of Cairo are historical treasures recognized by all who have even a little understanding of civilization. It is unfortunate that some who claim to be civilized have disregarded these beliefs. The people of Cairo remained calm during the air raid, which the government deeply appreciates.

### Yarn Flowers: Yarn Market Originally Followed Horse's Lead, Now Flies Behind Phoenix's Tail; Both Futures Yarn Markets Follow Blue Phoenix

The spot yarn market has been closed since September 18th, but the Shuangma Factory's exchange office is still operating as usual. The opening price was 1,752 yuan, a sharp increase of 9 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. As soon as this price opened, sellers rushed in, and the market loosened, falling to 1,744 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the exchange market price was trending downward step by step, and people's hearts were ordinary. Therefore, the Shuangma factory's orders fluctuated for a long time, but the momentum became more vigorous, returning to 1,747-48 yuan. Although most of the Guangbang merchants still arrived on the market, there were no transactions for the purchase of spot yarn. Until after 11 o'clock, rumors suddenly arose in the market, saying that cash had risen slightly and foreign exchange had shrunk slightly. As a result, various parties suddenly became active, and the price immediately reached 1,752 yuan. Unexpectedly, as the price rose, profit-takers began to sell, and the market loosened, falling to 1,741 yuan. The closing price was 1,743 yuan. It is estimated that about 8,000 bales were traded in half a day. The afternoon opened at 1,740 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange's prices for all months fell by 7-8 yuan to 10 yuan, people's hearts were timid, and the price gradually fell to 1,734 yuan. Some scalpers covered their positions, and the price rose again to 1,740 yuan. However, the environment was unfavorable, and the closing price fell again to 1,736 yuan. Regarding the current situation of Shuangma, some say that the exchange's previous month was squeezed down to 1,610 yuan, while the Shuangma price was 1,770 yuan. Currently, the exchange's current month is only 1,510 yuan, which is 100 yuan lower than the previous month's price. However, the difference between Shuangma and Lanfeng's marked yarn is different. The rise and fall of the market still depends on whether the actual position is progressing or not.

The Jinshuangma futures market situation is volatile, and it still has not shown a very strong trend. Because the hopes of all parties have not made any progress, large investors cannot help but be cautious. The market is quiet and hesitant. When it opened in the morning, the factory's orders opened high due to the rebound of American cotton, and the bulls followed suit to collect. The futures yarn market was active, with more demand than supply for a time, so both near and distant months rose. In the middle, because the exchange was upstream, the September contract once rose to 1,664 yuan, the October contract rose to 1,676 yuan, and the November contract also rose to 1,684 yuan. After entering, scattered bulls sold one after another, and there were differences again. The midday closing was near-month rising and distant-month falling. In the afternoon, as the exchange turned weak, the factory's orders also showed a soft trend. People's hearts were uneasy, and there was a rush to sell. The September contract fell to 1,656 yuan, the October contract fell slightly to 1,665 yuan, and the November contract also fell to 1,677 yuan. By the time of closing, it was slightly firmer, returning half a yuan to three yuan. As a result of the fluctuations throughout the day, there was no change in the near-term, the October contract fell by half a yuan, and the November contract was squeezed down by four yuan. The following is a table of transaction prices:

### Borrowing the Theme of New Cotton; Coarse Lint Jumps Six or Seven Yuan

The current cotton situation is still good. Although factories do not have an urgent need, people are concerned that the new cotton crop will be bad and expensive. In fact, even if it is bad, Chinese coarse lint may smoothly flow into the hands of Chinese people. This is just using the bad situation to peddle speculation. Therefore, the industry's view is still good. As for applying for foreign exchange, the government will certainly allow it for industrial raw materials, but speculators will be severely hit, so there will be no fear for future raw materials. Yesterday, there were many transactions for Indian cotton, such as Omra and Rangoon, and the price also rose by six or seven yuan, because the public expected coarse lint to be expensive and competed to buy it.

Omra 100 bales 346.0 Haojia

End of October Term

The New York cotton market initially fell due to Southern investors selling short, but subsequently rebounded due to buying by other investors, buying in New Orleans, and short covering. As a result, the closing price was about 17-18 points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to speculative buying and a good stock market, but subsequently fell slightly due to some floating bulls selling and European exporters selling. Yesterday's closing price rose by 1-2 rupees each. It is also predicted that the opening market situation today will rise by 1.75 rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction market is quiet and firm, but actual transactions are only slightly embellished with spot cotton. Although current demand for forward contracts is eager from all parties and the intention is very strong, due to the procedures not being perfect, they can only temporarily wait and see.

### Securities: C Bonds Not Too High; Situation Still Not Like a Small Face

The over-the-counter market for public bonds continued to be good yesterday, mostly due to short covering. The bulls took the opportunity to increase their positions. C Bonds discovered a new high price of 72 yuan 8 jiao and half after deducting interest. The market price is not too high, but the situation is still not like a sudden small downturn. This is all because the general public is not as confused about China's future as before, and they firmly believe that the future is very bright, so the confidence in bonds is more solid. Yesterday morning, Xinfu, Hongda, Yongkang, and Shengda bought in large quantities, while Zhongfu, Runli, Dazhong, etc. supplied. The midday closing was slightly better by 2-3 jiao. In the afternoon, Tongkang again had a strong appetite, in a large amount. Xinfu bulls increased their positions. Changji, Lianyi, and No. 25 all had needs. Although Xinhua came out, Xiexing, Yuanda Hua, and Jiufeng sold out. The market price was raised to the highest price of 28 jiao. Although the market price was raised very high, the number of transactions was not large. The total number of transactions for the whole day was only 1.45 million yuan. The following is a brief table:

Stock transaction:成交永安紗廠股 Ten shares of Wing On Textile Factory stock were transacted, the price being 207 yuan and half.

The turnover of public utility stocks was especially large, and the price changed from stable to firm. Although there were occasional headwinds in the middle, they were too short-lived. The potential of both industrial and rubber stocks is extremely good.

London, 17th (Wednesday). The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British-owned Far East companies' stocks remained flat today. Only bank stocks showed slight fluctuations. Jardine Matheson Bank rose one shilling and three pence to nine pounds seven shillings and six pence. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Hong Kong Registered shares fell by one pound to eighty-five pounds. There were prices but no market.

### Yangtze Bank Company Increases Capital to Acquire New Industries

The British-owned China International Trust Investment Company Limited plans to transfer most of its assets to the Yangtze Bank Company and liquidate itself. It is understood that all shareholders of International Trust will receive one new share of Yangtze stock for each share, plus a certain amount of cash.

Each old share can subscribe for one new share. The company also plans to reduce the face value of each share to five taels of silver. Each original old share will then be split into two new shares.

### Economic Talk

— Feng Liu

Lighters are boats used to transfer goods from large ships to the shore. The name "lighter" has been around for a long time, perhaps coming with the opening of trade between China and Britain. This term was first seen in Guangzhou, and then gradually spread from the Cantonese people to the coastal trading ports, and has now become a common term, but the origin of its original meaning is unknown.

I once saw the name "lighter" in Liang Tingnan's "Yifen Jiwen." It said:

"Bengal and Bombay are where opium comes from. Since the early Qianlong years, the number of people in the interior who are addicted to eating has gradually increased, and the smuggling has accumulated over the years. At one time, more than 20,000 boxes arrived, with a value of more than 60 million. They were continuously shipped from the new ports of Southeast Asia to Yuehai. The ships in Lingdingyang sold them and then shipped them again, endlessly, called lighters. They were entirely dependent on the unscrupulous people who were idlers and smugglers in the interior to carry them by boat into the country, and then transport them to the interior, passing through the coastal counties to Tianjin, all of which were where lighters flowed. The vendors first collected the goods in the provincial capital, entered the foreign residence, exchanged opium orders, gave them to the buyers, and showed them to the lighters, which then gave them according to the number."

Judging from the text, "called lighters" proves that the name "lighter" only existed at this time. "All of which were where lighters flowed" means that the coastal counties to Tianjin knew of lighters all came from opium smuggling.

What is the meaning of "躉"? It is the opposite of zero, and it means whole numbers, such as bulk sales, such as bulk purchases, all of which refer to wholesale transactions. However, "躉" is originally a vulgar character. The meaning of this character is likely limited to the old boundaries of wealth, with "thousands of strings of cash" as satisfaction. Therefore, the character "足" is added under the character "萬" to emphasize the greatness of its number. Now, when used for unloading ships, the cargo carried on the unloading ship ultimately does not seem to be much, and it is unloaded from large ships. It cannot be called whole, and it cannot be called "躉." To say that the cargo on the ship is sold in bulk rather than broken into pieces, so the ship is called a lighter, is also not close to the truth. According to this, the wholesale shop can be called a "躉 shop". What you need to know is that the lighters at that time were actually large foreign ships that could not sail into Lingdingyang, or they were afraid that the Chinese authorities would prohibit them, so they dared not sail in, and were parked in the outer ocean. The lighters then transported the opium to the inner sea. The place where the transactions were conducted was the foreign residence. The foreign residence was where foreigners lived, that is, the later consulate. Once the transaction was completed, they went to the lighter to pick up the goods. Therefore, the role of the lighter was actually to temporarily store the goods unloaded from the large ship. Therefore, I agree with Mr. Meng Xinshi's statement: "The so-called lighter may originally be a '頓' boat, meaning a place to stop." However, Mr. Meng did not want to confirm that its name was "頓" boat, indicating that it "may originally be". He also did not investigate the origin of the name "躉" and the reason why it should be "頓" boat. I am not talented, and I explain it again. If Mr. Meng were here, I don't know what he would think of my words!

I believe that the reason why "躉" is "躉" came from the foreign goods trade at that time. In the Chinese meaning, the word "躉 boat" is difficult to explain appropriately, and it must be related to the sound of foreign words. Therefore, I think that the "躉" in "躉 boat" and the "噸" in tonnage are both spoken by foreigners. The Chinese people imitated their sounds and used them along, so the "噸" in tonnage in "Yifen Jiwen" is also written as "躉," which further proves that my understanding is not wrong. The "噸" in tonnage comes from the pronunciation of the English word "Ton" and can be used as "躉," so how do we know that the "躉" in "躉 boat" is not similarly called a "躉 boat" from the English word "Tender"? Therefore, "躉" is a transliteration, not a translation.

"Tender" originally refers to a ship that transports passengers and goods from a large ship to land. There are also ships used to store food and other supplies for large ships. In short, it is a ship that assists large ships where they cannot reach, so as to connect the large ship with the land, regardless of whether it is passengers or goods, all with the purpose of reaching the land. According to the original Chinese characters, it can be called a lighter (now commonly written as barge). If using the English sound to call it, it would be most appropriate to translate it as "頓 boat" in both sound and meaning.

The sound and meaning of "頓" originally came from "屯," so there are stopping, storing, and depositing, and it also has the meaning of storing, which is actually close to the function of today's lighters. The sound is also similar: (I also have an article on "hoarding" waiting for a chance to publish in the future, you can refer to it) The goods of the lighters are nothing but the goods carried on the large ship that cannot be reached directly, temporarily stored to reach the shore, not for wholesale. The author at the time sought temporary convenience and wrote it as "躉 boat". Now, if we want to find a meaning that is both sound and meaning can be connected, then how about calling it "頓 boat"?

Also, the English term for a small steamboat used to tow cargo ships is "Tug," such as the ones we often see in the Huangpu River, with three or four cargo ships connected behind a small steamboat, and sailing away with a roar. Although "Tug" is also used to transport goods, it does not directly load and unload goods, so it is different from lighters. For the convenience of readers, I still use "躉 boat" in the title.

### Finance For the Deduction of Brokerage Fees, the Gold Market Was Once Excited; 2,000 Taels of October Futures Were Traded

Yesterday, the dull and dark market suddenly experienced unexpected twists and turns. The long-dormant October futures also fluctuated by 72 yuan, with trading volume increasing to around 2,000 taels. It is said that the HSBC's small counter reduced the US dollar exchange rate by .03125 to deduct Xu Kuo's brokerage fee, causing a reduction. Fellow traders were initially unaware of the truth and scrambled to buy, driving the price from 6,873 yuan to 6,945 yuan (bought by the Chaozhou gang). By 10:30 am, they gradually understood the reason for the reduction. Gold firms, seeing the high price, began selling, and silver firms re-emerged, pushing the price back down to within 6,900 yuan. In the afternoon, the difference was only 8 yuan, and the momentum turned sluggish again. Finally, it closed up 25 yuan. The market became listless again. Cash fluctuations were significant, with the market first rising and then falling. In the morning, Yongcheng first bought 10 taels from Hesheng for 9,060 yuan, pushing the price up by 20 yuan. Soon after, Gonghe sold 10 taels from Yuhao for 9,050 yuan. The price then gradually rose, with Xiangxing continuing to buy 10 taels from Defu for 9,070 yuan.

Xianghe bought 10 taels from Jinyuan and 20 taels from Chengji at 9,250 yuan. Soon after, the price fell back down. Xiangxing Yong sold 50 taels, Yida sold 40 taels, and Hesheng sold 10 taels, all bought by Dafeng. Zhongxing sold 20 taels to Xianghe, Yida sold 40 taels to Wanfeng, another 30 taels, and Lianxing sold 20 taels, all bought by Decheng, all at a price of 9,150 yuan.

There was a difference of 210 yuan on the day, and a total of more than 800 taels were traded. The selling price of cash gold from the local brands was 9,100 yuan, and the buying price was reduced by 100 yuan.

Futures Market Sentiment Slightly Up

Since the morning, the October futures (10 taels each) opened at 9:15 am at 6,873 yuan, up 3 yuan. Chida bought aggressively, pushing the price up to 6,880 yuan. The market was originally very stable. After 10 am, news suddenly broke that HSBC's small counter had suddenly reduced the US dollar exchange rate by .03125, causing a stir. Mingfeng, Dingsheng, Xinfeng Yong, and Yiyuan aggressively bought, and sellers temporarily held back, causing the price to jump up by more than 60 yuan. Xiangxing Yong bought, pushing the price up to 6,945 yuan. Later, it was understood that the .03125 reduction was actually a brokerage commission. Tianyuan resumed selling, and Litai, Hesheng, and Xianghe all sold. At noon, the price fell back to within 6,900 yuan. The noon close saw Dingsheng buy 20 taels from Tianyuan for 6,895 yuan.

### HSBC Small Counter Suddenly Reduced the .03125 Difference as a Brokerage Commission for Exchange Bills

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the Central Bank and HSBC posting the same rates. HSBC's small counter suddenly announced a reduction of .03125 in the US dollar exchange rate, to 5.28125 yuan. It was inquired that last Friday, 14 foreign banks in the city telegraphed the Hong Kong Equalization Fund, requesting to maintain the livelihood of exchange bill brokers. Yesterday, a reply was received stating that the reduced .03125 would be used as the broker's commission. However, in the black market, US dollars for non-essential goods were still very difficult to obtain at 4.75 yuan, leading speculators to directly settle transactions with banks, selling to banks at 5.125 yuan and covering short positions at 5 yuan. There was a lot of activity. The market price was approximately 2 pence 8.125 for British pounds and 4.6875 yuan for US dollars, tighter by .03125 and .0625 respectively compared to the previous day.

### US Dollars Have Begun to Recover

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds and British gold notes remain quite stable. US dollar notes have begun to recover, although they briefly rose to 22.7 yuan in the morning before falling back down. The final price was 22.2 yuan, a slight recovery of .4 yuan compared to the previous day. The trend of Hong Kong notes was stable, and the market price remained flat. Japanese gold notes continued to rise, reaching 2.38 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes saw a large surge, reaching 2.01 yuan in the evening market.

### Piece Goods Nanyang Sales Continue Uninterrupted; Factory Cloth Transactions Increase

The factory cloth market was stable yesterday, mainly because the situation in the Pacific remained tense, and speculative trading was considered difficult. However, actual sales were very good, with most being shipped to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang. Factory transactions increased daily, far exceeding market prices. For example, Jardine Matheson's Jin San Ta bleached cloth was quoted by the factory for futures delivery at 72.5 yuan, and Holland cloth was quoted at 12.5 yuan, both 2 yuan higher per piece than current spot market prices. The market price of all grades was stable yesterday. Street transactions amounted to over 500 pieces of various cloths. The Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled over 400 pieces of bleached and dyed cloths. The Nanyang merchants handled over 300 pieces of coarse and fine cloths, twills, and bleached cloths.

Eastern cloth spot market was closed. The leading standard of the exchange edged up, with September up 1.5 cents, October up 1.7 cents, November up (blank) cents, and December up 1 cent.

### Tea (2)

— Li Yuyong

(Continued from the 4th)

However, the majority of scholars still compromise on both the Chinese and Indian theories, believing that it originated in the mountains of the Tibetan Plateau, according to the opinion of the famous tea tree scholar Coben Staurt. He differed from them, saying that Chinese tea and Indian tea came from different systems. The small-leaf variety in China originated in China, while the large-leaf variety in India, Myanmar, and Annam is not found in southeastern China. He also used the trend of hybridization to examine its distribution and migration. Chinese scholars still advocate the theory of Chinese origin, believing that the wild tea of ​​Sichuan and Yunnan shifted east to become the small-leaf variety and west to become the large-leaf variety. "The record of eastward migration has already been mentioned above. According to records, the tea found in Assam is planted in groups and in an organized manner, and local natives still use it to make tea. In 1815, Latter and Gardner also said that tea trees grow in native villages in northeastern Assam and are used for their leaves. Only in Mengzi did they not see it being used by the natives. Staurt also said that tea trees are planted on important transportation routes in China and India. As for whether the tea originally produced in China can become large-leaf? Mr. Liu Zhen said: In recent years, there is a Narcissus variety in Fujian Province with leaves twice as large as ordinary ones. There is also a Buddha's Hand variety with very large and broad leaves. Therefore, it is also possible that the wild tea species migrated westward from Sichuan and Yunnan and gradually became large-leaf varieties due to differences in climate and planting and harvesting methods.

China has a long history of importing tea into Europe. The earliest record is from the 9th century AD, when the Islamic merchant Soleman said in his travelogue of Arabia, Persia, and China (1845), "The Chinese are accustomed to drinking a withered thing called Sakh, which is fragrant and bitter, and is said to be good for health. It is sold everywhere in the country." Marco Polo came to China, but he did not mention tea in his travelogue. In the 16th century, when the Portuguese traded with China, tea was already popular, but they did not trade it with China. The first European to record tea was Mattei in his History of India (1589). Later, Comte's "New History of China" recorded tea in detail. The Dutch East India Company was the first to import tea into Europe. Lettson said in his Tea Record in 1772 that the Dutch transported tea into Europe at the beginning of the 17th century, but not from China but from Japan. Bomene's Encyclopedia (1791) has an interesting story under the word "Salvia." He said that our ordinary Salvia is very popular with the Chinese and Japanese. The Dutch often collect this withered thing in Southern Europe and bring it to China to exchange for their tea. A large box of Salvia can be exchanged for two or three boxes of tea, but there is no other evidence. Although it is unreliable that the Dutch brought tea to Europe in the 17th century, it is undoubtedly the Dutch who brought tea to Europe. In 1641, a physicist in Amsterdam named Tulpiug wrote a medical record, saying that he had never seen tea, but in 1658, Piso said that the European aristocracy was already drinking tea as a fashion. It is said that tea first spread to Russia in 1600, to Paris in 1636, and to England in 1650. As for the transplantation of living tea trees, it was probably started by the Dutch. A merchant in Danzig named Breyn included tea in the plant atlas of the Dutch botanical garden in 1689, saying that it was planted in the garden of Amsterdam, but Puhuo knew that they all thought that Linnaeus of Sweden was the first person. The tea planted by Linnaeus was sent to him by Eckeberg, arriving on October 1, 1763, at least 80 years later than the Dutch. Linnaeus was the first person to name tea. He did not know that black tea and green tea were made from the same species. At first (1737) he called it Thea Chinensis, and later (1762) he divided it into black tea (J. Bohea) and green tea (T. Viridis). Bohea means Wuyi Mountain. Later, after several changes, he restored the earliest name. Under the species of tea, there are also several variants. According to Staut's opinion, there are four categories, namely the ordinary Wuyi variant (Var. Bohea), the large-leaf variant of the Sichuan species (Var. Macrophylla), the upper Burmese variant (Var. Shanform), and the Assam variant (Var. Assamica). The Pu'er tea we see is made from the fourth type. (End)

### The Municipal Council Approved New Electricity Pricing Methods; Three Surcharges Are Now Combined into Two; The Foreign Exchange Surcharge Will Change Monthly; The Total Standard Electricity Bill Is More Than 10% Higher Than Before

The Shanghai Power Company of the Public Concession, previously claiming a shortage of coal supply and uncertain deliveries, submitted a request to the Municipal Council for approval of electricity conservation measures. It stipulated that monthly electricity consumption should not exceed 72% of the highest electricity consumption in the previous year and also levied a fuel surcharge. From the 19th of last month, the method was changed again, increasing the surcharge for excess electricity consumption. Only a month later, the company submitted another request to the Municipal Council for approval to change the pricing method. Although the names established are different, the result is still an increase in expenses for users. The suggestions made by the power company were discussed twice by the Bureau, and finally passed by the Municipal Council's regular meeting the day before yesterday afternoon. The announcement issued by the Municipal Council yesterday is recorded as follows.

Using US$5 as a Standard

According to the Municipal Council Information Office, the Council recently approved, as suggested by the subcommittee, a plan to enable the Shanghai Power Company to increase its income to meet the company's debts and expenses. According to this plan, all current surcharges, namely foreign exchange, fuel, and temporary, are immediately canceled and replaced by (1) a fuel adjustment fee and (2) a revised foreign exchange surcharge. The fuel adjustment fee is the same as that always applied to large users. The revised foreign exchange surcharge applies to basic electricity charges and other miscellaneous fees such as the rental of electrical appliances, etc. If the US dollar is 5 yuan to 100 yuan of Chinese currency, then this foreign exchange surcharge is 100% of the basic fee and miscellaneous fees. In the future, monthly charges may vary depending on the rise and fall of the average exchange rate in the previous month. As mentioned above, the basic rate of the revised foreign exchange surcharge is 200%. If the income approved by the company is surplus or insufficient after the implementation of this rate, it may be revised in the future.

Pricing Methods Changed Again

The above plan almost allows each user to pay according to the actual cost of using electricity. The basic electricity charge for residential lighting is proposed to be reduced from the current 1.2 cents per unit to 1.1 cents per unit. In May of this year, when the company was approved to collect a temporary surcharge, it was already felt that it was necessary to change the pricing method. The approval of this temporary surcharge was originally an expedient measure, while considering this issue. It was found that the consumption of fuel and the sale of electricity are closely related, so it is believed that the best way to compensate for the extra expenses exceeding the basic electricity charge is to levy a fuel adjustment fee on all electricity charges, and the remaining income should be restored by implementing a uniform surcharge on the company's total fee rate.

New Method Will Be Used for Next Electricity Bill

The aforementioned plan was suggested by the Bureau's subcommittee, accepted by the power company, and passed by the Municipal Council's regular meeting after being transferred by the Public Utilities Committee. It is approved to be applied to the accounts for the period ending on or after October 1 of this year, and may be reconsidered by the Bureau or the company at any time in the future. The table below shows a comparison of current and future electricity charges (using the exchange rate and fuel costs applicable in September as the standard):

Note: (1) The total electricity charges now and in the future are calculated based on an exchange rate of US$5 and a fuel cost of 7.06 taels of silver per million BTU. (2) The surcharge includes the fuel adjustment fee. (3) Under the future basic fee, the residential lighting fee is reduced to 1.1 cents per unit. (4) The right table is in yuan.

### American Ship SS Lykes Detained by Jianghai Customs Allegedly for Violating Customs Regulations

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post* reported that the American Lykes Bros. Steamship Co.'s *Zoelaa Lykes*, was detained today (the 18th) by the Shanghai Customs authorities. It is said that the reason was a violation of Jianghai Customs regulations. The ship's Shanghai agent, American President Lines, declined to comment. When reporters inquired with the Customs Commissioner Mr. Lowford, he also declined to comment. The ship was recently built and was on its first voyage to the Far East. American President Lines has reported the detention to the US Consulate and is in direct talks with the customs authorities in an attempt to have the vessel released. The rumour that the ship was carrying machine oil for Japanese businesses, and was detained for violating a new embargo after arriving, with Japanese businesses asking for the detention when the vessel sought to divert to Manila, has been denied by the shipping company.

### Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Tracks Blown Up

Mixed Train Delayed; Full Explosion Destruction Encountered The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post* reported that early yesterday morning (the 17th) near Kunshan on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, there was a thunderous explosion which sought to blow up a mixed passenger and freight train from Nanjing to Shanghai. However, the train was slightly delayed and thus was not destroyed. According to the Japanese military authorities, the train left Kunshan fifteen minutes behind schedule. Shortly after, the engineer noticed a light waving six hundred meters ahead. He immediately stopped the train. The light was being waved by a Japanese soldier guarding the railway, who had heard the explosion and gone to investigate. He saw that a section of track and sleepers of about ten feet had been blown away, and frantically waved the light to warn the oncoming train. It was then discovered that the train, had it left on schedule, would have passed through that area at the time of the explosion.

### British Ambassador to Visit Rangoon To Strengthen Aid to China Mission to Negotiate Exemption of Military Supplies from Transit Taxes; Portuguese Minister Mr. Lime Returned to Shanghai from Qingdao

The whereabouts of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, are currently being revealed by British sources. The Ambassador flew from Chongqing to Burma on the 16th of this month, en route to Rangoon, and will spend three weeks in Rangoon. According to reports, the Ambassador's trip is ordered to handle the entry of Chinese and Burmese nationals and the exemption of US military supplies from transit taxes, which are also linked. The Ambassador is tasked with strengthening the mission to aid China. After finishing business in Rangoon, he will travel to Singapore to meet with the British Minister of Information in Singapore, Mr. Tuff Cooper. In addition, the Portuguese Minister to China, Mr. Lime, and his wife, visited North China and the Yantai Qingdao area earlier this summer for vacation. They went to Qingdao several weeks ago and have now returned to Shanghai from Qingdao, still residing at their private residence on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession.

### Yesterday Was the 10th Anniversary of the Mukden Incident Passed in Silence

Yesterday was the 10th anniversary of the Mukden Incident. People from all walks of life in the city commemorated the event spiritually and voluntarily suspended entertainment and banquets. The concessions were passed peacefully under the strict guard of the police authorities. Alert leaflets and slogans were found throughout the city. Citizens' morale was boosted. Due to environmental constraints, all walks of life in the city did not hold ceremonies for this commemoration, but supported the government's established national policy with spirit and unwavering will, striving for survival, and the increasingly favorable stage of the war situation added infinite excitement to this commemorative day, so they all voluntarily promoted donation movements. The V-shaped flag charity sale initiated by the Shanghai student community also began yesterday.

### Five Foreign Banks Resolved To Increase US Dollar Commission

Quotation is Five Yuan Two Eight One Two Five; The Statutory Exchange Rate of the Equalization Fund Remains Unchanged

Since the Equalization Fund began managing the foreign exchange market on the 18th of last month, announcing that importers engaged in legitimate trade would be allowed to use US$5.34375 and British currency three pence one eight seven five, only specially approved banks engaged in foreign exchange were to charge a handling fee of .03125, so the listed US dollar was five yuan three one two five and British currency was three pence one five six two five. Now it is learned that HSBC's quotation, since 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the US currency has shrunk to .03125, to five yuan two eight one two five, except that the British currency has remained unchanged. This change has attracted much attention from all parties. It is learned that this move has nothing to do with the Equalization Fund, and the exchange rate announced by the Association has not changed so far, so the .03125 reduction is entirely the result of the meeting of HSBC, Maijiali, Youli, Citibank Avenue, and Five Banks. The Five Banks decided not to participate in the black market, and for brokerage relations, the decision was made to increase the handling fee of .03125, for .0625, from yesterday, so even though the exchange rate announced by the Equalization Fund has not changed, the increased handling fee caused the US dollar to shrink to five yuan two eight one two five.

### Average Prices of Goods

The following table shows average retail prices for Wednesday, September 17, and from August 16 to September 15. The Municipal Council’s Department of Social Affairs compiled this price list for employers to adjust employee subsidies.

### The Japanese Assault Case the Night Before Last: Three People Were Injured, One Was a Customs Officer, and the Injured Chinese Man Was Suspected of Being Arrested

The North China Daily News reported that Mr. Fukuyama, a Japanese customs officer, was walking along Sichuan Road near Ningbo Road at about 9 p.m. last night (the 17th) when he was suddenly attacked. The assailant fired three shots, and Fukuyama was shot through his left arm with one bullet. He went to Fumin Hospital for treatment. Last night, at nearly 10 p.m., Japanese men Kimura and Suzuki were attacked by two Chinese men at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road. One was injured in the abdomen, and the other in the back.

The injuries were not serious.

According to police officers, the empty bullet casings found at the two crime scenes were similar. The motive for the shooting of these three Japanese civilians is not yet clear. Many believe that there is a political motive. However, it has been said that the three Japanese men have no connection with politics. After Fukuyama was attacked, he did not report it to the police but went to Fumin Hospital himself. Later, Japanese police officers accompanied the two Japanese men who were injured on Nanjing Road to Fumin Hospital, and only then did they learn the details of Fukuyama's

attack.

Two detectives from the Public Concession Police, Messrs. Moore and Kirk, are now responsible for investigating these two cases together with the Japanese military police. According to reports, after Fukuyama was attacked on Sichuan Road last night, the Central Police Station received a report that a car in the area had been shot at three times. However, this was later found to be inaccurate. The English-language "China Press" reported that after the two Japanese men were attacked on Nanjing Road and Shandong Road, public concession police officers arrived on the scene and arrested a suspected Chinese man who is now being questioned. The Chinese man has a bullet wound on his arm, which may have been self-inflicted.

Customs Officer

Another report states that at 9:25 p.m. the night before last (the 17th), a shooting occurred on Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road targeting a car. At the time, the car sped away, so it was impossible to know who was inside and whether anyone was injured. It is now known that the passenger in the car was Fukuyama Jitsu, a Japanese supervisor at the Jianghai Customs, aged 32. He had collected tax payments from Zhongshan Road and was passing the scene of the incident in a car when suddenly three shots were fired, all penetrating the car. One bullet shattered Fukuyama Jitsu's finger, and another grazed his sleeve, causing no injury. He went to the hospital for bandaging and then left. In the shooting that occurred at the corner of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road, Japanese men Kimura Riichi and Suzuki Soji both suffered bullet wounds in the abdomen, and their injuries are extremely critical. Suzuki currently runs a trading company on Miller Road.

### Shooting on Maohai Road and Yuezhou Road

Japanese Troops Surround a House, Exchange Fire More Than 30 Times, Resulting in Four Arrests

The Shanghai Times reported that the Japanese-language "Continental Daily News" stated yesterday (the 17th) that at 1 p.m. yesterday, Japanese Marine Corps soldiers surrounded a house at the corner of Maohai Road and Yuezhou Road. Four men inside opened fire with pistols in an attempt to break out. The Japanese soldiers also opened fire in return, exchanging fire more than 30 times. No one was injured. The four men were eventually captured and are now being interrogated.

### Hope and Encouragement (1) - Written After the Industrial and Commercial Group Scholarship - Written by Applicant No. 46

The Shen Bao is 69 years old, and its spirit of serving society and promoting culture is truly vigorous in its old age. This time, sympathizing with poor students, the newspaper has launched a scholarship campaign, making a sincere appeal to its broad readership. All those who receive assistance are deeply grateful and feel it in their hearts, which cannot be expressed in words. In addition to our gratitude, we must work diligently, study hard, and be loyal to our duties, so as not to disappoint the Shen Bao and its wide readership.

The situation of industrial and commercial employees is even more miserable and difficult than that of ordinary students. As for myself, I lost my father at the age of nine, and at thirteen, I stepped out of the school gate. In order to make a living, I had to go to the streets to beg. I had a sick mother to support, two young brothers to care for, and I was an ignorant youth with incomplete knowledge and skills. Since I entered a large public institution at the age of fifteen, for these long nine years, labor and tears have been my companions in life. However, I am young, I have a future, so I constantly seek knowledge and pursue truth on the thorny road, hoping to improve my personal life in the small way and not to be a useless person in the big way. I was fortunate to have my application for assistance approved this time, and I am very happy! After reading the entire list of recipients, I have many feelings. Since this event is still a pioneering initiative, it may not fully meet the ideals of the donors. Therefore, I dare to review the facts published in the newspaper, add my own humble opinions, and say a few words to the assisted friends, in order to fulfill my responsibilities and hope that the scholarship movement will be carried forward. I hope that people in society will teach me if there is anything inappropriate, I would be very grateful!

Since the Shen Bao subsidized students, due to the enthusiastic requests of industrial and commercial employees and the suggestions of donors who are enthusiastic about vocational education, the scholarship committee decided to allocate funds to set up an industrial and commercial group scholarship after careful consideration. It started on August 24th, with the announcement of two simple rules, namely that the approval of the manager must be obtained to avoid hindering business, and that the application should focus on tuition fees. On the first day of application, more than 200 people stood out. Individual interviews were conducted in batches from August 28th to make a decision. The list of approved names and amounts was announced one after another starting from September 1st.

After the news of the establishment of the industrial and commercial group scholarship was announced, there was another enthusiastic phenomenon, that is, various vocational supplementary schools responded one after another, willing to donate free or half-fee places for the Shen Bao to co-organize the event, a total of 21 schools. Their love for industrial and commercial youth is beyond words. From the approved list, we can

statistically

gain the following statistics: (A) Looking back at this approved application, in terms of occupational categories, there are: Category Applicants Percentage

Commercial firms 204 32.5

Companies and foreign firms 220 33.0

Factories 92 14.0 Cultural industries and public institutions 96 14.5

Unemployed 13 2.0

### The Assassination Case on Tongfu Road Yesterday: Chen Changkun Was Assassinated, The Assistant Manager of Xingye Thermos Factory Was Shot Twice and Died Instantly

A bloody incident occurred on Tongfu Road yesterday morning. The victim was Chen Changkun, the assistant manager of the China Xingye Thermos Factory at No. 15, Lane 315, on that road. Chen was from Shaoxing, 34 years old, and lived at No. 3 Baoxing Lane, Shanhai Guan Road. He had been the assistant manager of the factory for many years. He usually had a private chartered car for transportation. At 10:05 a.m. yesterday, Chen, wearing a black wool long gown and yellow leather shoes, took the chartered car, pulled by the driver Changfa from Jiangbei, to the factory for work. When he reached the entrance of No. 3155 near Xieqiao Lane, Tongfu Road, two men suddenly fired two shots at Chen. One shot hit the head, the bullet penetrating the brain from the edge of the right temple, passing through the eye socket. The other bullet hit the ring finger of his right hand. He immediately bled profusely and fell into the car. Changfa was extremely panicked, but still pulled the car and fled towards the factory. When he stopped at the factory gate, the nearby police officers had received the news and arrived, but the assailants had already escaped. The injured man was taken by car to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but because the injury was in a vital area, he died soon after.

Educational News

### Hong Kong Authorities Publish an Overview of Education in the Previous Year (2) Education Department and Normal School Students Must Take Remedial Physical Education Classes

Normal Education In 1939, the Normal School had 48 graduates. In September 1940, another 48 new students were recruited, 24 each for the Chinese and English departments. Six students received government scholarships this year, graduated from the University of Hong Kong, and obtained qualified teacher status. Another eight people received scholarships, seven of whom are required to study at the University for four years, and the other one is a university graduate who continues to study education for one year. Seven students from the University Normal School obtained diplomas in this year's graduation examination. There are currently 45 students. The special night college also has teacher training classes, which are exclusively for Chinese teachers currently employed. The admission qualification is two years of teaching experience. The study period is three years. There are currently 76 male students and 93 female students.

Women's Education (1) English Schools: A. European girls are co-educated with boys, as mentioned above. B. Asian students' English schools are not affected by the evacuation order. The official Belilios Public School for Girls has 4572 primary school students and 157 middle school students. There are seven subsidized schools with 1387 primary school students and 815 middle school students. There are two private unsubsidized girls' middle schools (each with attached primary schools), four primary schools, two vocational schools (co-educational), and six night schools at the primary school level. (2) Chinese Schools: A. In rural areas, there are eight subsidized schools and nine unsubsidized primary schools (including one night school), one middle school, and one co-educational vocational school, with a total of 2387 students. B. In urban areas, private girls' schools have a total of 30,260 students. 1137 students are studying in two subsidized schools, and 1931 students are studying in schools receiving subsidies (including 56 primary schools and 5 middle schools). In addition, there are 253 unsubsidized day schools and 28 night schools. There is one official Chinese girls' school, which has been changed from a normal school system to a middle school system, with 151 students. Seventeen students obtained diplomas in the July 1940 examination. (3) Teacher Training: At the end of 1940, there were 48 students studying at the Normal School, and another 29 students were studying at the Eastern District Chinese Women's Normal School. Ninety-three people studied at the Chinese Department of the Hong Kong Special Night College. In addition, six people studied at the University of Hong Kong and received government scholarships. (4) Higher Education and Vocational Education: Two women obtained scholarships from the University of Hong Kong. There are female students in the night college, a total of 146 people.

Physical Education and Other School Health This year has been expanded, and there is now one health officer, three assistant health officers, one female medical officer, one health inspector, and fifteen nurses. The physical education aspect of subsidized schools has continued to improve this year, and there has been a significant change in the attitude and methods of physical education. Special physical education classes for male and female teachers were held during the summer to improve school physical education standards. Now, students in the Education Department and Normal School are required to take remedial physical education classes, but the lack of sports fields in Hong Kong is the main shortcoming of physical education classes. Efforts are now being made to remedy this. All schools in Hong Kong established a concert society this year and held several performances. Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and St. John Ambulance Brigade are all interested. There are currently eight Girl Scout teams in schools, with a total of 197 people, and three Boy Scout teams with a total of 43 people. Fifty-two people participated in the ambulance team, including four teachers. This session has also made considerable progress in film education, slide explanations, and film exhibitions. From October 1940 to September 1941, 25,401 students and 3172 other people watched such films. One hundred to one hundred and fifty educational films are shown every month. The Teachers' Union and the British Far East Intelligence Bureau have provided assistance. There are currently a total of 64 types of educational films, silent and sound. It is expected that this will triple in the next twelve months. There are also two projectors.

Future Prospects and Goals The most urgent need to implement at present is to expand Chinese primary school education, especially the education of children from poor families. There are two ways to do this: to increase the number of official schools or to subsidize private primary schools. A "ten-year plan" has been drafted for the former, and a subsidy regulation has been drafted for the latter, which has been approved by the Education Committee and the Hong Kong Government. In addition, it is planned to establish a rural normal school. The problem of sports fields in urban schools has been made into a form by the Director of Education and sent to the urban design officer for reference. Once the subsidy regulations are approved, Hong Kong education will have reasonable development. The curriculum of English schools is currently being expanded to include manual arts and singing. Elementary science knowledge will also be taught in lower grades. The curriculum of Chinese schools and the Chinese classes of English schools are currently being studied by a special committee. After the report is drafted, it will be reconsidered. (End)

### "It Doesn't Matter If People Die" Theory

— Mu Chang

There's a common saying in Shanghai these days: "It doesn't matter if people die." This is an extremely vicious phrase. Those who utter it generously apply it to others, and their attitude is quite carefree, calling it "doesn't matter," meaning "transcendental"!

"It doesn't matter if people die" is just an empty phrase; however, there are those who express it through actions in this time and place. The past few days have seen some particularly brilliant displays on the trams: (1) A ticket seller, failing to extract a bribe, became enraged and, as the tram was moving, violently pushed a passenger, causing him to fall to the ground, hit his head, bleed profusely, and die. The ticket seller just laughed it off, "It doesn't matter if people die" (see the 16th's report). (2) A female passenger with a child entered the tram, and due to the crowding, bumped into the ticket seller, receiving a heavy beating in return. "It doesn't matter if people die," let alone the face of an infant (see the 18th's report)?

It's not like there's an irreconcilable feud, wanting someone to die. If they don't die, you still have to fight it out with them. However, when a third party can't stand it and wants to "care," they often end up being the ones punished.

In the former case (the passenger's death), the ticket seller leisurely rang the bell "twice" and then "himself" (?) opened the tram door and jumped off calmly? In the latter case, a mere woman was holding a child in one hand. How could she tear off the ticket seller's tall hat? But regardless of whether someone is "pushed down" or someone's hat is "torn," there are always righteous witnesses on the tram to solemnly testify to the event.

The "it doesn't matter if people die" actions are terrible, but "the living ultimately can't bear it." Fortunately, third parties step forward to uphold justice. Some students from a certain school and passengers in a first-class car can be moved by righteous indignation to stand up and reluctantly act as witnesses. This is certainly commendable, especially in a world where people often embrace the philosophy of "better to do less than to do more" or even "it doesn't matter if people die." Even the wronged souls would surely be endlessly grateful.

Of course, not all ticket sellers are black as crows. If there is a fault, correct it; if not, be encouraged. If you "protect your own kind and insult passengers as a group," you will only give people a permanently black impression, leading to no distinction between jade and stone, thinking that they are all crows. Furthermore, tram passengers rising up to form collective patrols is a form of passive resistance. Only when the authorities fundamentally resolve the issue... what can be done to prevent future deception?

Social Anecdotes

### Want a Quiet Meal? Go to the "Student Cafeteria"

— Xiao Wen

Rice also sells for $117 per dan (approx. 100 liters). It seems that ordinary wage earners and young academics need at least two dollars to fill their stomachs, considering current market prices. (This refers to those who can't return home for meals.)

The Shanghai Youth Student Cafeteria was created in response to this need. This cafeteria is sponsored by the YMCA's Student Relief Committee, and the funding comes entirely from the committee's fundraising efforts. The purpose of the cafeteria is to reduce the burden on academics and professionals.

The cafeteria officially opened in early September on the second floor of the Chinese YMCA at 599 Sichuan Road. The cafeteria is located in a corridor, and the boards on both sides are painted with white paint. Three fluorescent lights further illuminate the corridor, making it bright and eye-catching. Several tables about vitamin content ratios in various foods and human weight/height comparison charts are posted on the walls. Walking through the short corridor, the hall appears before you. The snow-white walls and milky white tables and chairs make this cafeteria very harmonious and bright.

The student cafeteria has established a cafeteria covenant. The three most important items are: (1) Take your own bowls and plates (2) Maintain order (3) Maintain cleanliness.

Regarding management: The cafeteria is modeled after a common American restaurant. Diners take their own bowls and plates. The method is for diners to take a rectangular white iron tray, take their bowls and chopsticks, and then go to the side, where several large trays of the day's dishes are lined up. A waiter scoops the dishes into the tray according to the diner's instructions, and then the diner pays and eats. The advantages of this method are: (1) saves time and effort (2) diners do it themselves to avoid trouble. In addition, the management of the cafeteria is relatively easy. In ordinary cafeterias, waiters are constantly coming and going, and the cafeteria is filled with smoke and disorder. However, the student cafeteria is different. All you see are two waiters scooping dishes and one waiter serving rice, all wearing white uniforms. In addition, there is a cashier and a female manager taking care of the entire cafeteria.

Order and cleanliness are also special features of this cafeteria. Ordinary cafeterias are disorderly, with shouting and noise filling the room. Diners simply can't find a moment of peace. Some even spit phlegm and spill tea, making a mess. However, such bad phenomena do not exist in the YMCA student cafeteria. You feel quiet as soon as you walk in. If you want to eat a quiet meal, this is a good place!

Lunch and dinner cost $1.40 per meal. If you are not financially well-off, you can reportedly receive preferential coupons from the YMCA!

### Gilded Figures

— Lang

Around 1 PM, "Bang!" The door of the small room slammed shut. "Whack, whack..." A rattan cane landed on flesh. This was followed by suppressed sobbing. I guessed that the unfortunate person was being beaten again. In the evening, a familiar person lightly slipped down the stairs. Everything else was the same, except her eyes were swollen like walnuts, and her face was bruised. Her hair was short, sticking up on her head like a spring meadow. In the darkness, she barely looked human. I knew these were the marks left by the rattan cane. She began to sob, "Because I told you who the country guest was who came today, she beat me like this..." I felt very indignant, but also a little angry, and even a little amused. I didn't believe there could be such a stupid person in the world!

Poverty isn't shameful. As long as you don't steal, don't rob, don't do anything that harms heaven and earth, then what does poverty matter? Those people are, after all, extraordinary, and Shanghai is a place that values appearances. The arrival of such a rustic, unsophisticated poor relative is no wonder seen as a great shame. But if this poor relative hadn't come, people wouldn't have valued her either. Just by listening to the words she constantly mutters and looking at her face, you can be sure she's a mean-spirited person.

### Fragments of the Solar Eclipse

— Shi Hua

This year's solar eclipse is far more precious than those in previous years. It is said that such a total solar eclipse is visible only three times every thousand years in one location, or once every three hundred and sixty years. Reports say it is only visible once every few decades, which is still an understatement of its rarity.

The path of this solar eclipse starts 200 li south of Yili, Xinjiang, and passes through Gansu, Qinghai, Fujian, and out to sea at Xiapu, totaling over one hundred counties in eight provinces.

The eclipse began at 11:15 AM (Central China Standard Time) and traveled 4,000 kilometers across China, taking one hour and twenty minutes.

During this eclipse, Wuhan and its three towns were directly in the center of the total eclipse zone, and the time coincided with noon, making the phenomenon extremely noteworthy. The residents of the three towns can experience the most dramatic situation at that time. Although Chongqing cannot see the total eclipse, it can see nine-tenths of it.

(Editor's Note) A total solar eclipse on the 21st of this month.

Tales of the Past

### Biographical Notes on the Case of the Civet Cat

— Liu Tang

Three: Consort Li Chen

Consort Li Chen, a native of Hangzhou, was the birth mother of Emperor Renzong and a maidservant of Empress Liu. Emperor Zhenzong appointed her as the keeper of the bedchamber. The keeper of the bedchamber is a female servant official. Before emperors marry, they first choose an older woman from the palace maids to serve them, which is customary for female servants in the palace. Just like Xiren, Qingwen, and Sheyue in the Dream of the Red Chamber, who were variations of the four officials. Empress Liu was most favored by Emperor Zhenzong, and Consort Li was the keeper of the bedchamber for Empress Liu, so Emperor Zhenzong knew that Consort Li was pregnant; how could Empress Liu's inability to bear children be hidden from Emperor Zhenzong? The novel fabricated the story of a civet cat replacing the true pearl because they were unaware that Consort Li was a palace maid of Empress Liu. At that time, Emperor Zhenzong was eager for a son, and seeing that Consort Li was pregnant, he hoped that the child would be a boy. He once went to the Linqi Terrace, and Consort Li's jade hairpin suddenly fell down. The Consort felt ominous, but the Emperor saw that the hairpin remained intact, suggesting that the child born would be a boy. When the attendants retrieved the hairpin, it was indeed undamaged, and the Emperor was delighted. Later, she gave birth to Emperor Renzong, was granted the title of Lady of Chongyang County, and gave birth to another daughter, who did not survive. She was promoted to Talent and later to Concubine Wan. From this historical fact, it is clear that Consort Li gave birth to Emperor Renzong, which is a publicly recorded fact. Therefore, as soon as Consort Li gave birth to a son, she was promoted from keeper of the bedchamber to Lady of Chongyang County, and then to Talent and Concubine Wan. All of these events occurred during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong. If it were truly a civet cat replacing the prince, would Consort Li have enjoyed such glory? Moreover, it was not only known in the palace and by the imperial uncle (Eighth Prince), but also by ministers (such as Lv Yijian and others). The only one who didn't know was Emperor Renzong himself. Empress Liu didn't want Emperor Renzong to know, precisely because of Empress Liu's political strategies and her desire to maintain power! Therefore, Emperor Renzong's upbringing was entrusted by Empress Liu to Consort Yang, who took care of him. Consort Yang and Empress Liu were originally in the same rank and were good at catering to Empress Liu, so Empress Liu trusted her and took the child from the hands of the maids and raised him with Consort Yang. This was because Empress Liu didn't want the biological mother to raise her own child and isolate the mother and son's feelings, fearing that one day the child would seize her position and disobey her orders. Although Consort Li was promoted to Consort Shun when Emperor Renzong ascended the throne, she still remained quietly among the concubines of the previous dynasty, not wanting to stand out. Everyone in the palace feared the Empress Dowager, and no one dared to speak out. Even the unwavering Eighth Prince was still afraid of being resented by Empress Liu and deeply regretted his actions. The rest can be imagined.

Twelve: Unexpected Turmoil

"Now you lie down for a while longer, and I'll go out for an hour or two and come back and drink millet porridge with you." After watching Qiu Haitang drink down a large bowl of medicinal juice, Yu Kun said to him with a smile. Finally, he added, "Today, I also brought a large piece of Jinhua ham!"

He said he would be out for an hour or two, but in fact, he didn't return until nine o'clock.

"What? Old Three, so stingy! You didn't even buy me a bottle of Wu Jiapi wine!" This time when Yu Kun came back, he didn't seem as concerned as before. Looking at the small plate of ham that Zhang Laoliu steamed for him, he kept clamoring for wine.

Today, Qiu Haitang's spirits were indeed much higher because a good friend had suddenly come to visit and he had drunk another dose of medicine. Before Yu Kun returned, he had already leaned against the bed and drunk half a bowl of millet porridge by himself.

"Okay, Old Liu, quickly go and buy four taels of Wu Jiapi for Master Second!" he shouted from the room inside with a smile.

"I say you're stingy, and it's really true! Who are you inviting to drink with four taels of wine?" Yu Kun said as he tossed a dollar to Zhang Laoliu. "I'll pay for it, but we're going to drink until we're happy!"

Once he started drinking, Yu Kun's old temper came out in full force. Separated by a wall, Qiu Haitang could constantly hear him humming various tunes. At the same time, he was unreservedly joking with Zhang Laoliu, talking about everything from matters in the fields to women's affairs, saying anything and everything. (215)

### Hobbies of Movie Stars

— Xin Fang

Everyone inevitably has a few hobbies to adjust the monotony of daily life. Hollywood stars are certainly no exception. To be honest, most stars' hobbies can be included in the normal range. Below are a few introductions to established stars:

Myrna Loy spends most of her spare time growing flowers in her own garden. In addition, she has an orchard, and it is said that the various vegetables she now eats are all produced by this orchard.

Judy Garland has a special love for music and has collected nearly two thousand records over the past decade. Judy is also a painter. Last year, she gave a painting as a gift to her mother.

Maureen O'Sullivan's only pastime in her spare time is browsing books on child psychology. She believes that in order to make a child's development satisfactory, one must first understand their psychology. She also applies this principle to educating her own children.

"Queen of Song" Jeanette MacDonald likes to collect fans of all styles. She often invites relatives and friends to admire these treasures. Recently, an 82-year-old fan gave the singer a fan she used at her wedding sixty-eight years ago, and attached a note: "Because you are a representative of beauty, I am giving you this ivory fan today."

Mickey Rooney has been truly popular in Hollywood recently. Because he is in his prime, he is enthusiastic about all activities. In terms of movement, he excels at ping-pong, football, and swimming. In terms of stillness, he is preparing to write his own biography. His literary works have already been published in newspapers and magazines. It's no wonder that such a talent has caused a sensation throughout Hollywood!

### Blood Rain and Exquisite Flowers

Chapter 16: Taking a Delicate Bird Out of its Cage Early

Just at this moment, a guard under Wu Sangui came in and reported, "The old General at home has sent someone to tell the General to return because another imperial edict has arrived, urging the General to go through the pass." Wu Sangui hastily waved his hand, telling the guard to leave. He then said to Tian Hongyu, "Thank you for inviting me to drink tonight, and for giving me Yuanyuan as a gift. Not only have I been satisfied with wine, but also with virtue, and given beauty. I am extremely grateful. However, I cannot stay longer due to official duties. Please bid farewell to Yuanyuan. I will certainly protect your residence in the future. Please do not worry." Tian Hongyu said, "Very well, but the old man was unprepared to prepare dowry for Yuanyuan on short notice. How about the old man send Yuanyuan to your door tomorrow?" Wu Sangui shook his head and said, "There is no need for that. Please prepare an oil-painted carriage and carry Yuanyuan with me. I have already received great kindness and dare not accept the dowry. Please forgive my impoliteness." As he spoke, he stood up. Yuanyuan was still sitting to the side, leaning her delicate body. Tonight's banquet was originally her own ingenious plan, just to catch a glimpse of that handsome young Marquis, but who knew that her ideal would become a reality. Hongfu didn't have to elope, and she was actually going to go with this romantic general. Naturally, she couldn't express the immense joy in her heart, but she remained calm and didn't show any emotion. Tian Hongyu saw that Wu Sangui was eager to leave and couldn't persuade him to stay, so he had to follow Wu Sangui's instructions and hurriedly ordered his servants to prepare an oil-painted carriage, harnessed with fine horses, to send Yuanyuan away. In a short while, the carriages and horses were ready. Wu Sangui took Yuanyuan in his arms and said goodbye to Tian Hongyu. Yuanyuan also didn't have time to change her makeup, and just wore the light-colored clothes she had on, and went with Wu Sangui. Tian Hongyu sent them outside the door, watching Yuanyuan get into the oil-painted carriage. Once the curtain was lowered, he couldn't see her beautiful figure again. Wu Sangui jumped onto his saddle, said "goodbye" to Tian Hongyu again, and gave a shake to the reins, saying "Let's go." Four guards led the way in front with large canopy lights, closely followed by the oil-painted carriage. Wu Sangui's horse followed behind the carriage. The sound of the wheels and the horses' hooves traveled forward to the main road. In a flash, they turned a corner and disappeared from sight. (174)
