### Hull Issues Formal Statement: U.S. Far East Policy Unchanged; Aid to China to be Handled by Hopkins; Central Executive Committee Discusses Consequences of Soviet-Japanese Treaty

Washington – Secretary of State Hull, abandoning his usual practice, issued a formal statement yesterday while receiving journalists, stating that the significance of the reported Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty had been overestimated. In reality, the treaty seemed to describe a situation that already existed between the two countries, so there was nothing surprising about it. However, whether both governments would abide by the treaty was still a question. As for the policy of the U.S. government, it would, of course, remain unchanged. (Reuters, 15th)

Washington – Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., stated yesterday that the Soviet Union's signing of a neutrality agreement with Japan was something that would "cause disappointment" in China. After meeting with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Dr. Hu told reporters, "Before we have the full text of the Soviet-Japanese agreement, we cannot predict how important the agreement is. However, the agreement is indeed regrettable. We hope that the Soviet Union will not cease its aid to China." Dr. Hu also stated, "The Soviet Union has provided aid to China in the past, and China expects this aid to continue." While Mr. T.V. Soong met with officials from the Treasury Department, Ambassador Hu spoke with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Mr. Soong said that he believed the situation regarding the imminent establishment of a consolidated fund agreement between the U.S. and China was "extremely smooth." (United Press, 15th)

Washington – Treasury Secretary Morgenthau declared yesterday that U.S. aid to China would, at a minimum, maintain its current level. Mr. Hopkins would handle this matter. Mr. Hopkins is the former Secretary of Commerce, and several experts from the Treasury Department would assist him in matters of aid to China. (United Press, 15th)

Chongqing – The Central Executive Committee discussed the situation created by the Soviet-Japanese treaty yesterday morning for quite some time. Ministers of the relevant departments also gathered in the afternoon to study this issue. (Havas, 15th)

### Chongqing Newspapers Express Dissatisfaction; Xinhua Daily Defends

Chongqing – Official newspapers of the Kuomintang and the Central Army have expressed the central government's extreme dissatisfaction with the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty signed in Moscow on Sunday. However, the communist newspaper Xinhua Daily stated that these comments were unjust and unreasonable faultfinding. The Kuomintang's Central Daily News, the main mouthpiece of the Chongqing government, said that the treaty was extremely regrettable and that the treaty and its accompanying joint declaration violated the 1937 Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement. The Central Daily News's commentary was titled "Infringement of Chinese Sovereignty," stating, "The Soviet authorities have repeatedly expressed their determination not to recognize Manchukuo, but no sooner were the words out of their mouths than they forgot their promise." The newspaper warned the Soviet government that agreements made with Japan were unreliable. The Central Army's Saodang Bao also similarly criticized the Soviet-Japanese treaty. The newspaper's commentary stated, "We are very pessimistic about the prospects for international justice and believe that the actions taken by our ally (the Soviet Union) are extremely regrettable." The Chinese Communist Party's newspaper, Xinhua Daily, strongly opposed the criticism of the Soviet-Japanese pact, stating that even the joint declaration issued simultaneously in Moscow did not affect the territorial integrity of Outer Mongolia and Manchuria. The Soviet Union's promise not to invade Manchukuo should be interpreted as the Soviet Union declaring that it would not use force to invade Manchuria and should not be interpreted as the Soviet Union recognizing Manchukuo as an independent country, nor does it affect our efforts to recover Manchuria. As for the claim that the new treaty conflicts with the 1937 Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, this is simply illogical because the nature of the two treaties is completely different. We cannot tolerate anti-Soviet propaganda or malicious criticism of this matter from an anti-Soviet stance. The Catholic Yishi Bao strongly attacked the Soviet-Japanese treaty, saying that it violated the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, which stipulated that the Soviet Union had an obligation not to conclude treaties with China's enemies. The Soviet-Japanese treaty also violated the 1924 agreement, which fully recognized Outer Mongolia as part of Chinese territory by the Soviet Union. Yishi Bao's commentary stated, "Now the Soviet Union openly equates Outer Mongolia with Manchukuo. This move has greatly damaged the Soviet Union's prestige. The Soviet Union has been deceived by Matsuoka." Yishi Bao said that Japan clearly wanted to remain neutral in the event of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, without being constrained by the Tripartite Pact. The newspaper further predicted that after the Soviet-Japanese treaty, the Soviet Union would engage in anti-German activities in the Balkans. The newspaper also said that the new Soviet-Japanese treaty would increase U.S. aid to Britain, China, Greece, and Yugoslavia. (United Press, 15th)

Chongqing – The Central Daily News reported that a reporter visited the Soviet Embassy yesterday afternoon to interview Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin. The reporter was received by Guo Waerfu, the Second Secretary of the embassy, who stated that Ambassador Pan was suffering from a stomach ailment and was unable to receive guests, for which he was very sorry. Later, although the reporter submitted several written questions about the international situation, Ambassador Pan was unable to answer due to illness. (Havas, 15th)

### U.S. Newspapers' Opinions on the Neutrality Treaty are Divided and Inconsistent

Washington – The reactions and speculations of major U.S. newspapers regarding the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty are quite inconsistent. However, the general tone is that the treaty has an impact on the global situation, especially on the United States. The newspapers expressed unanimous opinions on the following three points: (1) Japan has been freed to operate in the Pacific, and the United States' attention must shift from aiding Europe to the Pacific. (2) The Soviet Union is now secure in Asia and can act freely in the West because the Soviet Union's interests in the West are threatened by Nazi forces. (3) The signatory countries still harbor suspicions toward each other, and the Soviet-Japanese treaty will only be effective as long as it benefits both parties. Whether the two countries can achieve the various benefits they are currently proclaiming through the Soviet-Japanese treaty depends on the circumstances at the time the treaty was concluded and how Japan will utilize the treaty in the future. It is questionable whether the Soviet Union and Japan will actively cooperate with the Axis powers. However, after the conclusion of the Neutrality Treaty, Japan has given the Soviet Union the freedom to implement anti-German policies, while the Soviet Union has given Japan greater freedom to pursue anti-American and anti-British policies. If the Soviet authorities believe that slightly encouraging Japan can accelerate Japan's collapse and force the United States to withdraw entirely from the Pacific to the Atlantic, so that the Far East can belong to the Soviet Union, then from the Soviet Union's perspective, slightly encouraging Japan is inevitable. The New York Times stated that the Soviet-Japanese treaty would prevent Britain from stationing a large army in Singapore. According to the newspaper's explanation, this was a victory for Hitler's diplomacy, but the result may be the opposite. The New York Afternoon Newspaper believes that the new treaty is a prelude to the Soviet Union's activities in the Balkans. Therefore, this is actually a diplomatic failure for Hitler. Hitler hoped that after the end of the war in the South, he could attack the Near East from the Balkans. The new treaty is a warning from the Soviet Union to Germany, indicating that the Soviet Union intends to change its past policies. The 500,000 Red Army soldiers on the Siberian border have not yet reached the time for redeployment. Japan does not seem likely to transfer its troops stationed in Manchuria to other locations immediately. In addition, Japan faces the threat of the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, and there is no hope of ending the war against China. This is also a major problem for Japan. The Washington Star believes that the new treaty is very unfavorable to the United States. The importance of the new treaty depends on how the signatory countries interpret it and how much trust they place in each other. On the surface, the new treaty seems to be a victory for Matsuoka's diplomacy, but the Soviet Union is clearly uneasy about Germany's victory in the Balkans and is willing to compromise with Japan in the hope that Japan will not attack the Soviet Union when the Soviet Union is drawn into war elsewhere. Sims, the international news editor of the Dutch-American newspaper, believes that the new treaty is a major threat to the United States, and a major war in the Pacific is likely to break out. The Washington Daily News stated that if the signatory countries believe that they can adhere to the letter and spirit of the treaty within five years, regardless of the situation, then the new treaty is indeed a very important treaty. However, both parties seem to intend to implement the new treaty only during periods when it benefits them. The Baltimore Sun said that if Japan interprets the new treaty as aiming to prevent the United States from entering the war, believing that this will prevent the United States' policy from exceeding the influence of last year's Tripartite Pact on U.S. policy, the United States should pay closer attention to the situation in the Pacific. However, this does not mean that the United States will stop aiding Britain or take other measures necessary to deal with the situation in order to safeguard its interests and security. (14th)

### Various Soviet-Japanese Issues Still Difficult to Resolve - Izvestia's Commentary

Moscow – Today's Izvestia stated that the Soviet-Japanese agreement has not resolved all aspects of Soviet-Japanese relations, but it has opened a direct path toward resolution. The difficulties encountered in negotiations on the fisheries treaty, trade agreement, and economic issues between the two countries have long been known. The occurrence of this situation is clearly due to the lack of normal relations. Now that relations between the two countries have entered a new stage, it is expected that there will be positive results. (Reuters, 15th)

### Soviet Ambassador to France Assures that Policy Toward China Remains Unchanged

Vichy – Reliable sources told United Press today that the Chinese government is currently formally inquiring with the Soviet government about the Soviet Union's intentions toward China after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. It is reported that the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to France, Bogomolov, assured Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador here, that the Soviet Union's attitude toward the Chongqing government had not changed and that the Soviet Union would continue to supply China with military goods. However, well-informed sources do not know whether the Soviet ambassador was instructed by Moscow or was merely expressing his personal opinion. French observers, on the other hand, asserted that the new treaty was beneficial to Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan, and was a failure of British and American diplomacy, especially that of the United States. They declared that the U.S. government could no longer hope to conclude any agreement with the Soviet Union to enable the U.S. and the Soviet Union to adopt parallel policies in China, Southeast Asia, or the Pacific. The French also said that the mutual distrust among Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union had been largely eliminated by the new treaty. (United Press, 15th)

### Pravda Says Japan Has Recognized the Importance of Friendship with the Soviet Union

Moscow – Regarding the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Agreement, Pravda commented, "Thirty-six years have passed since the end of the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, the Russian side lost repeatedly and signed the Treaty of Portsmouth. However, it was not Russia or the Russian people who were defeated, but the Tsarist regime, which was not supported by the people. Since then, relations between Japan and Russia, and between Japan and the Soviet Union, have been very tense, and have even led to serious armed conflicts, such as Japan's intervention in the Far East from 1918 to 1922, attempts by some Japanese politicians to force the Soviet Union to accept their will, the Lake Khasan Incident, and the Red Army's annihilation of the invaders in the Battle of Nomonhan, all of which show that Soviet-Japanese relations are far from normal. Some Japanese politicians have attempted to make the Soviet Union the target of their aggressive policies, which is a grave mistake. This is because the Soviet Union has always been committed to peace and will never allow others to control its policies in violation of its own interests. The Neutrality Agreement and Declaration announced today are documents of far-reaching political importance. This document is an important step for the two countries to improve relations. In this regard, the wishes of the Soviet and Japanese governments are to strengthen the peace and friendly relations between the two countries. The Neutrality Agreement stipulates that both parties guarantee to maintain friendly relations and mutually respect each other's territorial integrity and inviolability. The agreement also specifies that if either signatory country becomes the target of an attack by another or multiple other strong countries, the other party shall observe neutrality throughout the entire period of the war. The Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration is also extremely important. The declaration follows the spirit of the Neutrality Agreement and states that both sides guarantee to respect the territorial integrity and inviolability of the Mongolian People's Republic and Manchukuo. This has put an end to all border conflicts. These border conflicts have not only disrupted the peace on the Mongolian-Manchurian border, but have also caused continued friction between the Soviet Union and Japan. The conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Agreement is particularly important at a time when the First World Imperialist War is expanding. During this period, the improvement and normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations is indeed an important step for peace and is also fully in line with the Soviet Union's policy of peace and good neighborliness. The Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Agreement has provided a way to resolve pending issues such as the fisheries problem. Although Soviet-Japanese pending issues are of great importance, they have been delayed. The crux of the matter is the failure to establish a political understanding between the Soviet Union and Japan, and this political understanding is a prerequisite for resolving economic issues. This prerequisite has now been met, and the two governments have vowed to strive for friendly relations. At this point, all obstacles that previously hindered the development of Soviet-Japanese relations have been completely eliminated. In the past, the Japanese government sometimes failed to understand the importance of friendship with the Soviet Union, but now the Japanese government, including Konoe and Matsuoka, has realized that friendly Soviet-Japanese relations are the most important condition for the prosperity and development of the two countries. Since signing the Neutrality Agreement, the Soviet Union and Japan have assumed a firm obligation, and this obligation will certainly be fulfilled, because the development trends of the two countries have made it necessary for them to become good neighbors, eliminate all factors of hostility, and avoid actions that hinder each other from completing their historical missions. We warmly welcome the Neutrality Agreement and Declaration and firmly believe that this agreement will create a true Soviet-Japanese friendship and peaceful relations." (TASS, 15th)

### British Newspapers Generally Believe that the Treaty Was Concluded Because the Soviet Union Was Facing Events in Europe

London – Regarding the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, the Manchester Guardian reported that the Soviet Union signed the treaty with Japan because it feared Germany. If Japan remained neutral in the event of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, it would be extremely beneficial to the Soviet Union, but it would be detrimental to Germany. If war were to break out between Germany and the Soviet Union, how Germany and Japan would interpret Article 5 of the Tripartite Pact would still be a question. The reason why the Soviet Union is particularly keen on Japan remaining neutral is

### The Turbulent International Situation

Recently, there have been two relatively unusual events in the international arena: first, Germany and Italy have not hesitated to increase friction with the Soviet Union and have used force to invade the Balkans; second, despite various fundamental conflicts of interest between the Soviet Union and Japan, they have signed a political compromise treaty. These two events will, of course, affect the current and future international situation.

Regarding the most noteworthy international reactions after Germany and Italy's invasion of the Balkans, the first is the attitude of the invaded countries themselves, the second is Britain's expression, and the third is the Soviet Union's position. The terrible sacrifices and trampling suffered by Greece and Yugoslavia, who resolutely confronted violence, have shattered Germany and Italy's expected easy victory, creating a situation in which they are fighting on two fronts. On the British side, according to Prime Minister Churchill's speech a few days ago, there is indeed a determination to fight to the end alongside Greece and Yugoslavia, regardless of success or failure. This, in contrast to the recent war situation in Europe and Africa, shows that Britain is now gradually focusing on the European front. As for the reaction of the Soviet Union and Turkey, apart from the Soviet Union breaking its usual silence and condemning Hungary, Turkey has also begun to evacuate civilians in border areas. Of course, the Soviet Union and Turkey have not clearly expressed their opposition to Germany and Italy's actions, but their attitude is very different from the past. Putting these phenomena together shows that everything in the Balkans is brewing actively, and the current military advances and retreats of the two forces are secondary.

Regarding the international reactions after the Soviet Union and Japan signed the so-called "Neutrality Treaty," the most noteworthy is the second step taken by the two signatories, followed by the reactions of China, Britain, the United States, Germany, and Italy, which have close interests with the Soviet Union and Japan. Analyzing the purposes of the two signatories, they are not focused on the treaty itself, but on the effect it has on the attitudes of other countries; as for the fundamental relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan themselves, it will not change because of this treaty. The reason for this move, on the Soviet side, is a strong warning to Germany and Italy's concentrated eastward advance into the Balkans; on the Japanese side, it is to try to intimidate Britain and the United States again, in an attempt to get them to ease economic blockades and political pressure. However, this is an ineffective wishful thinking. China has already clearly stated that it does not recognize it. Britain and the United States seem to consider it insignificant; in other words, this mere piece of paper will definitely not cause Britain and the United States to change their current firm stance. As for Germany and Italy, they have not yet expressed anything positive, but it is not difficult to see their unease and displeasure. This is because this treaty was definitely not facilitated by Germany and Italy, and it is not parallel to the Tripartite Pact and Soviet-German good relations.

Combining all these reactions, it can be seen that in the entire development of the international situation, there is now considerable turbulence again; and its future trend, based only on what has happened in the past few days, cannot be taken as a sufficient basis for evaluation, and we must wait for the evolution of many other key factors in the international arena. What can be pointed out now is probably no more than three things.

The first is Soviet-German relations. Assuming that because of Germany's aggressive eastward advance, a major friction and direct conflict arises between the Soviet Union and Germany, the international anti-aggression group that has been brewing for years can be promoted. In the situation where the Soviet Union joins hands with all just forces, not only can the flames of war in Europe be quickly extinguished, but also the forces of justice in any other region of the world can quickly achieve final victory. Conversely, if the Soviet Union continues to supply Germany, preventing it from attacking Ukraine for the time being, then Germany and Italy may be able to find a way to avoid direct conflict with the Soviet Union, but in the end, it will infinitely prolong the European war and bring major crises and future disasters to the Soviet Union itself. If the Soviet Union takes a middle course and completely cuts off aid and supplies to Germany and Italy, the war will also be shortened.

The second is US-Japan relations. If the United States believes that the Soviet Union's intention is to promote conflict between the United States and Japan, and that Japan does have the strength and courage to advance southward, then the actions of the United States and Japan in the East will inevitably accelerate and intensify. Conversely, if the United States considers it insignificant and Japan is still waiting and seeing, then the storms in the Pacific will eventually subside.

The third is Sino-Soviet relations. If the Soviet Union continues its past policy of aiding China, then all the current turbulence will only be superficial bubbles and will not affect its mainstream; conversely, the stabilization of the international situation will take more time. It is hoped that Japan can create a new war with the United States in the Pacific, and Germany is also very willing to see Britain's allies drawn into a new whirlpool of war. The Daily Express stated that the Soviet-Japanese treaty is merely (window dressing) for Japan, indicating that the Soviet Union no longer trusts Germany. If Germany actually moves east, then Japan will no longer be of assistance, and the Soviet Union's policy has no other purpose than to benefit itself. The News Chronicle also said that the Soviet Union is striving to build up its national strength while the powers are competing, and the only winner when the warring countries are both defeated will be the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union did not feel threatened by Germany before, but recently Germany's sudden advance into the Balkans has drastically changed the situation. To cope with the European situation, the Soviet Union urgently wants to guarantee the security of Siberia. Now the Soviet Union is giving Japan the opportunity to advance into the South Pacific, which is the price it pays to guarantee Siberia. The Daily Mail's diplomatic correspondent said that after the Soviet-Japanese treaty was concluded, Japan could be free from worries to the north and could now challenge Britain and the United States by advancing southward.

Melbourne – Today, Japanese Minister to Australia, Kawai Tatsuo, stated that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Agreement did not contain any meaning of southward threat. Japan's policy toward Australia is an absolute and unchanging policy of peace and friendship. (Reuters, 15th)

Tokyo – This morning, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii, when receiving news reporters, was asked about the future relationship between the Soviet Union and the Chongqing government regarding the Soviet-Japanese Agreement. Ishii replied, "I hope that the Soviet Union's attitude toward Japan will be good from now on." Someone also asked whether the Soviet Union's aid to Chongqing with war supplies violated neutrality. Ishii replied, "That question needs to be discussed in the future. That question is not directly related to the Neutrality Agreement. It is hoped that the Soviet Union's attitude toward Japan will improve after the new treaty is established." The main point of the new treaty is that it contains the meaning of the Soviet Union's recognition of Manchukuo. However, the biggest point is that both parties must abide by neutrality. The treaty once used the word "inviolable" in place of "mutually non-aggression." The government will approve the treaty as soon as possible, approximately before Foreign Minister Matsuoka returns to Tokyo. The full text will be announced after approval. However, the outline announced on Sunday night is essentially nothing more than this. The treaty text is written in both Japanese and Russian, and both texts are authoritative. (Reuters, 15th)

Tokyo – This morning, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told reporters that the Soviet Union and Japan will sign a trade agreement within days.

### German Army Adopts Pincer Offensive; Near East Faces Serious Threat; British Forces in North Africa Ordered to Retreat to Matruh; Fierce Battle Underway at Sollum and Tobruk

Vichy: The Istanbul radio station reported that the German High Command plans to use the eastern Mediterranean as a base to capture Palestine, Suez, Egypt, and other places in the Near East, and to launch a pincer offensive with the German forces in southern Libya to encircle the British forces on the Nile River, and then to aid the besieged Italian forces in Abyssinia. Hitler may choose either the Soviet Union or Turkey to allow troops to pass through. German secret agents have already contacted Persia, Iraq, Syria, and other countries to negotiate passage. It is likely that it will be very difficult for German troops to pass through Turkey. According to reliable information, German expeditionary forces are arriving in Libya in large numbers. These troops have undergone long-term special training to withstand the extreme heat in the desert. They are required to live in artificially created hot rooms in Germany, with a temperature of 105 degrees Fahrenheit, covered with dry sand. They practice in these "hot ovens" for several months. Only those who are unharmed are sent to Africa. (Associated Press Telegraph of the 15th)

London: It is estimated that the Axis forces in Libya have two to four German mechanized divisions and four Italian divisions. The danger now facing the Suez Canal is far more serious than it was before the British launched their offensive on December 9 last year. German tanks are larger and stronger than British tanks. Now that the German army has captured air bases on the Libyan border, it is foreseeable that German aircraft will heavily bomb British military installations in Egypt and ships in the Suez Canal. (Associated Press Telegraph of the 15th)

London: German motorized units yesterday launched a strong challenge to British dominance in the Mediterranean, the likes of which the British Empire has never seen. The vast war in Egypt and the war in Greece appear to be about to begin. According to a communiqué, the Allied forces in Tobruk have repelled the joint German-Italian attacks, and the fierce battle in Sollum seems to be still ongoing. It is not yet known whether General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces, intends to establish a defensive line near Sollum to defend Alexandria and the Suez Canal. People here do not regard the retreat of the British-Greek Allied forces from northern Greece as a defeat, as they do not know the details of any major battles. It is generally believed that the British-Greek Allied forces must be consolidating their positions and preparing to launch a large-scale operation. Furthermore, wireless reports from Athens state that the military situation in Greece is quite satisfactory and that the morale of the troops is even higher than when the German army began its attack. (Associated Press Telegraph of the 15th)

New York: According to the Ankara correspondent of the Columbia Broadcasting System last night, General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces, has ordered all troops in the Western Desert to withdraw to the defensive line in Matruh, which is located east of Sidi Barrani and is a strong stronghold on the Egyptian coast, fifteen miles west of Alexandria. British personnel in Ankara have received this news. It is said that the British army does not intend to defend Sidi Barrani. It is reported that the German army in Libya now has a total of three mechanized divisions, while the Germans say that there are four British motorized divisions in Tobruk.

London: A communiqué from the War Office announced that on Monday morning, enemy infantry, assisted by tanks, attacked Tobruk. According to reports, twenty enemy tanks broke through the outer defensive lines. The British forces immediately counterattacked and drove the enemy back. The enemy soldiers and tanks suffered heavy losses. The situation in North Africa has stabilized again. The British forces have re-established contact with each other and inflicted heavy losses on the vanguard of the enemy forces near Sollum. In Abyssinia, British forces are continuing to pursue the disorganized and retreating enemy forces and have captured many prisoners, including a division commander and a brigade commander.

### Nazi Mechanized Units Advance Towards Florina; British-Greek Allied Forces Hold Strong New Defensive Line; Greek Army Conducts Strategic Withdrawal from Koritza

London: A communiqué from the War Office announced that British forces in Greece retreated to new positions on Saturday night. As they retreated, enemy forces continued to exert pressure on the eastern sector of the British lines, but were heavily defeated by the British covering forces and suffered heavy casualties. There was significant activity on the right flank of the British lines, but no major engagements. German forces also continued to attack the central sector of the British lines, but failed due to intense British artillery fire. Snow is now falling in the area and the weather is extremely cold. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)

London: According to recent news received here, although powerful German forces, including mechanized units, are advancing towards Krichani and Siatista, fifty miles south of the Monastir Gap and Crete, the overall situation in the Balkans remains very encouraging. It is believed that the German advance in the Florina area has been achieved because of the British withdrawal to new positions over the weekend. It is reported that the new British positions are all in naturally dangerous terrain, where mechanized units will be of no use. The three places where the Germans are currently advancing—Krichani, and Siatista—are located midway between Salonika and Albania, forming a triangular area. It is reported that Krichani is not within Albania. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)

Athens: Athens Radio broadcast a communiqué from the Greek Ministry of the Army stating that the enemy appears to be concentrating troops and supplies in the Monastir region. British and Greek aircraft are heavily bombing and strafing German forces in the area. The failure of the German forces to break through the lines in the first few days and the continuous reinforcement of the Allied forces' resistance lines have strengthened the general belief that the Allied forces have established a strong line from the Adriatic Sea to the Aegean Sea. The positions held by the Allied forces are naturally strong strongholds, and the enemy's mechanized blitzkrieg tactics are ineffective against them. All sources say that the situation can be considered satisfactory, and there is nothing else of major importance to report. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)

Rome: Authoritative sources here stated last night that the Italian Ninth Army has now recaptured Koritza and its surrounding areas in Albania. Koritza is located in southeastern Albania, not far from the Greek border. It was occupied by Greek forces after the outbreak of the Italian-Greek War. (Haitong Telegraph of the 14th)

London: According to an official announcement from Athens, the Greek army has also conducted a strategic withdrawal from the Koritza area south of Lake Ohrid. This is because after the German army occupied southern Nischiraf, the flanks and rear of the Greek forces there were exposed, so a withdrawal was necessary. The Greek communiqué stated that the Germans only discovered the Greek withdrawal twenty-four hours later and urgently dispatched motorcycle units to pursue and search, but it was too late. Dozens of these units have already been captured by the Greek army. In the area of western Macedonia, fierce battles have taken place between tank units in the Ptolemaios area. In Albania, enemy forces have launched attacks in various places, but have been repelled, and over two hundred enemy soldiers have been captured. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)

London: Berlin claims that British forces have begun a general retreat from Greece, which British senior officials dismiss as "hardly worth discussing." It is claimed that recent news is to the contrary. Fresh British troops are landing in Greece, and large British and Greek forces are rushing to the front lines to reinforce the defense against German forces. (International Telegraph of the 15th)

### Serbian Army Displays Fighting Spirit, Situation in Southern Country Greatly Improves

Athens: The Athens Radio broadcast a statement from the Ministry of Information stating that the main forces of the Serbian army in the southern country appear to have retreated entirely into the mountains, making it easier to defend and posing a permanent threat to the flanks of the invading army. The situation in the northern part of the southern country is unclear. The Serbian forces there appear to have retreated from the plains of Croatia, Slovenia, and Banat, moving south into the highlands of Bosnia and Herzegovina, approaching Seville to defend strong defenses. The situation in the southern part of the southern country has greatly improved in the past forty-eight hours. It has been confirmed that the Serbian forces have broken the German lines of communication and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy forces. The German communiqué stated that its mechanized and armored units could not be used in this highland area. At the same time, an official communiqué from the capital of Bulgaria stated that British and Serbian aircraft had again attacked targets in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia on Monday night.

(Havas Telegraph of the 15th)

London: According to Athens Radio news, although German troops have now broken through the southern end of Yugoslavia, the situation in the mountainous areas of the south has improved significantly. Because German troops cannot use mechanized units in this mountainous area, the Serbian army has seized the opportunity to launch continuous attacks, inflicting heavy losses and cutting off its lines of communication. It is now reported that the Serbian army has advanced towards Skopje, which was recently occupied by the Germans, and there are reports that the Serbian army has recaptured the city. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)

Rome: Regarding the operations of the Italian and Yugoslavian armies in Scutari, it is reported here that in the past forty-eight hours, the Serbian 3rd and 52nd Divisions have continuously launched fierce attacks on the Italian positions.

Budapest: Local radio reported that Hungarian officials had recently issued a statement responding to the US Associated Press's disapproval of the Hungarian entry into the Southern Country. It was claimed that Moscow had misunderstood the situation. The Hungarian-Southern Country Friendship Treaty was signed with the legitimate Southern Government that was overthrown in the coup. The new government of the Southern Country attacked the Hungarian government for disturbing Hungarian citizens and damaging Hungarian property, so the Friendship Treaty was cancelled. The Croats have already declared independence, and there is no longer a Southern Country. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)

Swiss Capital: The "Zurich News" recently carried a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that German political figures had said in discussions that Hungary had already joined the Balkan War, and that three other countries in Southeastern Europe that had joined the Axis alliance would also follow Hungary's lead and join the war in accordance with the provisions of the alliance. (Havas Telegraph of the 14th)

### Balkan War Approaching Turkish Border; Turkey Trains Civilians to Defend Against Paratroopers; US Consul Advises American Citizens in Turkey to Evacuate

Istanbul: The Turkish government has today begun a large-scale recruitment of Istanbul university students to organize special corps to be trained to resist paratroopers. Turkey's recent emergency measures to deal with possible incidents have been prompted by the German invasion of Southern Greece and the occupation of Bulgaria. At the same time, it is reported that Germany will hold large-scale naval and air force exercises near the Soviet Black Sea coast off the coast of Romania and Bulgaria within a week. Twenty German submarines gathered in the Romanian naval port of Constanta will participate in the exercises. Since the US Consul in Istanbul issued a third notice to Americans in Turkey to leave as soon as possible, the imminent threat to Turkey's borders has become increasingly clear. Turkish school teachers have been ordered to stop traveling so that they can guide children to evacuate in the event of war. (International Telegraph of the 15th)

Istanbul: The US Consul here recently issued a notice to Americans in Turkey, advising them to return to their country as soon as possible.

The events in the Balkans have brought the war closer to the Turkish border, and transportation is becoming increasingly scarce. If war breaks out, transportation may be cut off." There are thirty Americans in Turkey. (Associated Press Telegraph of the 15th)

### British and German Air Forces Unusually Active; Piraeus Again Subjected to Air Raids

Cairo: The British Air Force Command recently issued a communiqué stating that our aircraft continued to bomb German troops in Italian Libya today to hinder their advance, and attacked enemy supply columns between Mues and Sollum. They also repeatedly bombed German forces in Greece, making it impossible for them to advance to the front lines. Our fighters encountered a group of German aircraft over the city of Koritza in Albania and immediately engaged in air combat. One German "Fiat" fighter was shot down. Last night, our heavy bombers bombed the port of Tripoli in North Africa, just as fresh German troops arrived at the port. Several troop transport ships were hit by our aircraft, and one ship caught fire after being hit. In addition, the port's power plant and customs house were destroyed. (Havas Telegraph of the 14th)

### American Flying Fortress Arrives in London for the First Time; Range Can Reach Over Two Thousand Miles; Powerful Weapon for Aerial Warfare

London: A Reuters Air Force correspondent reports that a new American four-engine Flying Fortress has crossed the Atlantic, breaking all records, and has already arrived in Britain. These aircraft are Boeing B-17-C models. This is the first time the British Aircraft Production Department has obtained this new type of aircraft, and it will soon be incorporated into the fleet to join British aircraft and other American four-engine bombers in combat, continuing to strengthen the power of the British Air Force's bombing offensive. The new Flying Fortress is manufactured by the Boeing Company's Seattle factory and is equipped with significant improvements. The four engines are Wright Cyclone engines, each with 1,200 horsepower. The speed is 300 miles per hour at an altitude of 25,000 feet, so it can fly 2,450 miles, enabling it to fly from Britain to the Norwegian border in the Arctic, the eastern border of pre-war Poland, or the southeastern corner of Italy and return. Its bomb load is also very heavy. The aircraft is fifteen and a half feet high, sixty-eight feet long, with a wingspan of over one hundred feet, and can carry seven to nine crew members.

### Southeast Asian Defense Strengthened, Japan's Southern Advance Difficult, Japanese Troops in South China Fear Chinese Counterattack, Shenzhen Bao'an Troop Increase to 10,000

Hong Kong: According to opinions of American military observers here, since the defenses of the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Malaya have been strengthened, it has become increasingly difficult for Japanese troops to invade these areas. The defense authorities of the various colonies are able to cooperate, so the air force strength has also been increased. The number of first-line fighter planes in the aforementioned island nations has exceeded one thousand, while Japan's total air force strength is only about two thousand. It is rumored that Japan has obtained blueprints for German Messerschmitt and Stuka dive bombers, but due to a lack of materials and manpower, they are still unable to manufacture them themselves. Japan's southern advance requires the assistance of a large air force, but observers point out that Japan's current air force strength is insufficient for a southern advance, as the distance from Japan's bases is at least 2,500 miles. Although Japan has bases in Taiwan and Hainan Island, the facilities are limited and can only provide small-scale supplies and repairs. Because the southern advance is not likely to be launched temporarily, the Japanese troops in Hainan Island and Vietnam have been summoned to Guangzhou and Bao'an to strengthen their position in southern China. Chinese newspapers report that the Japanese troops in Shenzhen Bao'an have increased to 10,000, which has caused considerable concern among people here, as it is very close to Hong Kong. However, well-informed sources say that the Japanese troops are very afraid of a counterattack by a large Chinese army from northern Guangdong, so their troop increase is only for self-defense. The Japanese army is determined to defend Danshui to block the Guangzhou-Shaoguan highway. At the same time, the Japanese navy is strengthening the coastal blockade line from Shantou to Macau to prevent the entry of supplies into the mainland. Hong Kong's commerce reached an unprecedented peak three months ago, but it has now declined sharply due to the blockade. People in Hong Kong are excited to hear that the Chinese army will launch a large-scale counterattack to drive the Japanese troops out of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Danshui, as this would restore prosperity to Hong Kong. However, this has not yet materialized. Recently, it was rumored that General Xue Yue, the commander of the Chinese army in Hunan, will be sent to Shaoguan to lead the counterattack. Xue Yue has defeated the Japanese army on the Longhai Railway, in Jiangxi and Hunan, and has a good reputation. (International News Agency, 15th)

### A View of the United States Navy

Fleet Prepared for Battle: We are now steaming westward in the Pacific. After receiving news of an enemy attack, Chief of Staff Taft, holding a military conference on the aircraft carrier "Enterprise," first ordered the head of the reconnaissance department, Androzhi, to search for traces of enemy ships. The reconnaissance department is composed of heavy cruisers and patrol bombers. Their actual task is to find the enemy's tracks, and then, carrying intelligence, retreat to the formation within the defense line. Before long, traces of the enemy were found. The axis of the 20-mile-wide fleet's ring formation advanced directly toward the enemy's location. Destroyers rushed out of the outer perimeter at high speed, battleships steamed forward, until the entire fleet assumed an advancing posture. The commander-in-chief expected that the enemy might turn south during the engagement. Therefore, he sent a large number of destroyers and light cruisers, driving out from the left to prepare for the enemy's destroyers to attack, so they could be netted and annihilated. However, for the sake of complete security, he retained some destroyers and light cruisers in the center of the formation. The commander-in-chief stood on the bridge of his flagship. The captain of the flagship, like the captain of any warship, stood in the conning tower, behind 16-inch-thick steel plates, directing the battle.

At the instant of discovering the enemy, all the officers and soldiers on the ship were extremely nervous. Vigorous junior officers climbed up the gun turrets. Sailors tested electric bells, codes, and telephones, and moved gunpowder bags to the upper hoist room. Gunners moved shells weighing 1,400 to 2,000 pounds, preparing to fire. Sailors in the engine room were all guarding their posts. When the sailors moved, they were quiet and very agile, closing the watertight doors and hatches tightly, removing the light bulbs in the room, and piling or tying down all movable objects and parts on the ground. Items such as buckets, chairs, frames, tables, and silverware were piled on the floor. If it were a real battle, sofas, tables, and chairs would have to be thrown into the sea one by one. Because when a cannon is fired on a ship, its recoil is very large, and wooden fragments, etc., hitting a person's body are more harmful than iron fragments, so they must be cleared out one by one before the battle. At this time, the inside of the warship was completely dark except for the green and faintly shining signal lights. Only the combat staff room hidden inside was brightly lit, filled with various wheels, machines, detection sights, and those calculating the firing. On warships, those who usually serve as barbers and cooks are assigned special combat duties, or clear away all the debris damaged by the artillery fire. All parts of the ship are isolated from each other, and the deck has long been cleared. Under the dim green light, the ship's chaplain entered the rear infirmary, waiting for the arrival of the wounded.

Enemy Destroyers Attack: The enemy and the two major fleets of the United States assembled into a combat formation, almost forming parallel lines. The United States Navy tried to assemble its larger and slower battleships. At this extremely tense moment, the enemy naval commander-in-chief, relying on his faster warships, planned to deliver a surprise blow while the US Navy was assembling into formation. His trick was to use the attack method of destroyers.

At first, he sent out two teams of destroyers, a total of eight ships, driving in reverse, spewing out a cloud of inky black smoke. The remaining twenty-six ships of the destroyer fleet were covered behind this smokescreen. In the far right corner, the enemy's light cruisers supported the battle. In an instant, these many destroyers, in a complex and interwoven dense formation, rushed out of the smoke screen and pounced directly on the front line of the American fleet. The American destroyers immediately came out to meet them. At this time, the enemy's light cruisers bombarded the American destroyers. The giant American cruisers opened fire on the enemy's light cruisers. The light cruisers in the defense line of the US Navy greatly demonstrated their heroic combat skills. Their fierce artillery fire had destroyed most of the enemy's destroyer fleet, and broken and floating damaged hulls were visible everywhere on the ocean.

All Scattered Things Were Removed from the Room Before the Battle

In the midst of the melee, three ships of the enemy's destroyer fleet that had not been sunk took the opportunity to pass through the line of fire and steamed forward. They had already aimed their guns. Mines were also ready to be released. Three miles away from the American front line, they turned their rudders to face the American front line with their broadsides, and each destroyer released eight mines in a row. The giant American battleships turned their hulls to the side, not to escape the enemy, but to sail toward the enemy, so that the dangerous mines would slide past the side of the ship without damaging them. The enemy's attack plan was completely shattered, and the smoke screen of their destroyer fleet had also dissipated. At this time, the attack opportunity for the American destroyers and cruisers was ripe. At this point, the battle had entered the final stage of the main battle between the battleships. (The End)

### Shanghai Women's Supplementary School, Teacher Strike Unabated, Both Main and Branch Schools Temporarily Suspend Classes, School Releases Information on the Strike

The teacher strike at the Shanghai Women's Supplementary School, caused by teachers demanding higher pay which the school refused to accept, resulted in the Hua Long Road main school being unable to hold classes due to the lack of teachers yesterday morning, and therefore students were unable to attend classes and the school was at a standstill. Yesterday morning, the Bai Ke Road branch school also posted a notice announcing a temporary suspension of classes for one week. The main school also posted a notice announcing a temporary suspension of classes.

Teacher Demands: The teachers of the school have made a total of six demands. The following is an excerpt: (1) The base salary per hour should be calculated at one-tenth of the tuition fee charged by the subject, and individual teachers should receive the same treatment, with subsidies remaining unchanged. (2) Salary increases should be calculated based on the number of registered students, without being limited to 100%. (3) Except for summer and winter vacations, salaries should not be deducted for other holidays. (4) Teachers should not be dismissed on any pretext during the semester. (5) Letters of appointment for the next semester should be issued one month before the semester examination. (6) This regulation will be implemented from April 1941. The above six articles must be answered in writing before noon on April 12.

School Statement: According to the person in charge of the school, the school was founded in the autumn of 1932 and has been operating diligently for nine years, resulting in today's achievements. The occurrence of this incident was due to some teachers presenting the following conditions last Friday: (1) Double the base salary, (2) Salary increase based on the number of registered students, (3) The original 30% subsidy remains unchanged, (4) Holiday salaries are paid as usual, (5) Teachers should not be dismissed midway, (6) Letters of appointment for teachers for the next semester should be issued one month before the end of the semester, and a reply must be given by noon the next day, otherwise it will be difficult to continue. It is found that the school's colleagues' salaries were increased by 20% last semester, and another 10% this semester. For full-time teachers who teach for four hours a day, such as Mr. Dai, a university graduate, the monthly salary is 156.6 yuan, and for Mr. Tang, a middle school graduate, the monthly salary is 111.9 yuan. As for those with lower monthly salaries, they are all part-time teachers who are paid by the hour, about 80 cents per hour. Moreover, most teachers have lunch at the school, and the school also provides transportation. Such treatment is not low compared to other cram schools. However, now that prices are rising and colleagues are having a difficult time, the principal is quite considerate and is planning to increase the subsidy again. As for holidays, salaries are not deducted. There has never been a case of dismissing teachers midway. This is a decision to hire new teachers, which is being prepared by advertising for new students to open new classes. There is no intention to dismiss the original teachers. The director of education has been mediating and has already approved a slight increase in the subsidy. The teachers also agreed to attend classes as usual. On Monday morning, most of the teachers attended the first two classes and then left. Unfortunately, some students broke into the principal's office to question them, resulting in such a dispute, which is a phenomenon that has not occurred in the school for nine years. It is very regrettable. Efforts are currently being made to mediate, hoping that the situation will not escalate and will be resolved as soon as possible.

Study Lecture

### How to Study National Language (6) Xue Wu Jing

(5) Points to Note in Writing: Reading is the absorption of material; writing is the expression of thought. Generally, after much reading, what is accumulated within will naturally flow out in the form of articles from emotion and intellect. I will now discuss the points to note, dividing them as follows:

(A) Handwriting is a person's appearance. Although one cannot speak of minute calligraphy or elegant strokes, the most important things are, first, correctness, second, neatness, and third, speed. One must strongly avoid broken characters, simplified strokes, and sloppiness. Also, words that sound the same but have different meanings, such as 辨 (biàn, distinguish), 辯 (biàn, debate), and 辮 (biàn, braid), and words that look similar but have different meanings, such as 羸 (léi, weak), 嬴 (yíng, win), and 贏 (yíng, win), must all be clearly distinguished. Do not make mistakes when writing. If there are any errors, create a table of corrections and review it often. Then, when facing the world, you will be more than capable. (B) The Way of Composition: First, use words correctly; second, construct sentences; third, plan the composition. Grammar must not be incorrect, and sentences must be clear and coherent. Further, strive for harmonious rhythm and beautiful rhetoric, but the most important thing is still moving description, genuine emotion, and noble thought. As for the use of allusions, they should be shallow rather than deep, and popular rather than obscure. Practice writing styles from proficiency to ingenuity, from imitation to creation. Although beyond the rules, it is always within the framework. The subtlety of using them depends on the heart, and that is the extent of literary ability. Speaking of opportunities for publication, assigned writing is for beginners. If a person's thinking has gradually matured, then write notes or diaries, observe at any time and any place. As long as emotions stir within, they will naturally manifest externally. Other ways, such as gathering comrades to study literature and reporting findings within a set time, can increase interest, and the source of writing will naturally flow torrentially, like the Yangtze River, with a momentum of a thousand miles.

6. Tools

If one wishes to do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools. The sharp tools of the national language are Shuowen, Ciyuan, and dictionaries. Since Xu Shu Chong of the Han Dynasty compiled the Shuowen, he thoroughly explained the origins of character creation, the format of the six scripts, and the differences between form, sound, and meaning. It is truly a remarkable book of philology. Although many have written about Shuowen, the Shuowen annotations by Duan Yucai, the Shuowen punctuated readings by Wang Yun, and the Shuowen Tongxun Dingsheng by Zhu Junsheng are all immortal works. Those who wish to deeply enter the hall of national language must, of course, browse through them. Even at the lowest level, one must first read a primer on characters to understand the origins of characters, so as not to be confused and interpret them literally. As for the compilation of dictionaries, the Kangxi Dictionary is the most comprehensive in terms of content, and Wang Yunwu's Four-Corner Code Dictionary is the fastest to check. Everyone should have one of each on their desks for easy reference. And for the investigation of sources, there is first Ciyuan, then Citong, and finally Cihai, which everyone knows, so I will not repeat it.

7. Cultivation

I have taught the national language for twenty years. Besides students of average talent, the best students are either highly talented, writing fluently, or diligent in study, turning base metal into gold. These two types of people often go their separate ways and cannot be combined. Now I put forward the word "cultivation" precisely to refine them into one. The starting point is to broadly read books of ancient and modern times, observe the dynamics of human groups, observe their commonalities, and grasp their essentials, so that emotions are rich, reason is profound, and personality is noble. Then, whether speaking at length or briefly, with the six reins in hand, one can control them freely, can reach the peak and become an outstanding person. Try to see if there is the righteous indignation of Yue Wu Mu, where would the Man Jiang Hong be? Without Wang Chong's talent and thought, where would the Lun Heng be? And Ziyu's magnificence is entrusted to Mencius, and Zhong Ni's greatness is expressed in the Analects. Those who truly aspire to deep learning in the national language cannot simply strike two lines of classical Chinese or write a set of humorous and satirical articles to be considered an outstanding literary figure for thousands of years. Nourish your temperament, elevate your personality, and articles that flow from your true nature are the great works of thousands of years. (End)

### Food Grain: Rice Prices Soar, Difficult to Stabilize; Over 100,000 More Bags of Rice Arrive; Hoarders Still Operate Recklessly

Yesterday's market for foreign rice saw initial gains followed by a drop, and then a recovery. Although the final result was a rise of one or two yuan compared to the midday market of the previous day, it was still down by half a yuan to one yuan compared to the evening market of the previous day. When the market opened in the morning, following the upward momentum of the previous day, buying interest was still active. The selling prices of various grades of foreign rice all rose to the high prices of the previous evening. No. 1 Saigon immediately opened at 122 yuan, No. 2 and Xiaojiao at 118.5 yuan, and other rices all rose, two or three yuan higher than the previous midday market. However, after the high prices, sales became sluggish, and various rumors of self-inflicted troubles were proven to be insignificant. The new hoarders, seeing a thick profit of seven or eight yuan per picul, were happy to take the opportunity to unload, and the market fell back by two yuan at noon. However, in the afternoon, the hoarders used rumors to stimulate the market again, and buying interest became strong again, with selling prices of various rices rising by another 1.5 yuan. Although the result showed a firming trend, the market was ultimately lower than the previous evening. Yinghua Company's returned rice opened at 137-138 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 112.5-111 yuan for broken rice, and 140-141.5 yuan for Xiaojiao. The transaction volume was about 1,500 tons. There are currently 15,000 bags of foreign rice.

The rampant momentum of the rice hoarders is not weakening. The surge after the Tomb Sweeping Festival is shocking.

However, it can be seen that a large amount of foreign rice is still arriving at the port. The Therese Maller, a liner of the 賜洋行席拉斯, transported a large batch of foreign rice from Rangoon, totaling over 5,000 tons, or about 55,000 bags, arriving in Shanghai on the evening of the 14th and docking at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong to unload. In addition, the Essi, managed by the manager of the Zhongtong Company, transported 16,029 bags of foreign rice from Haiphong, which arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong to unload. The Taigoo Company's Taiyuan also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 5,265 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docking at the company's wharf in the French Concession to unload. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, also carrying 2,651 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docking at the Roosevelt Wharf, unloading overnight last night.

In addition, a large batch of Java pearl rice is coming to Shanghai. The Java Company's Zhibisha sailed directly from Surabaya to Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 34,000 bags of corn and docking at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong to unload. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 3,548 bags of corn from Hong Kong and docking at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. (Zu)

The arrival of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rices has become scarce, so the sellers are more determined to raise prices, continuing to push higher. The sales side also believes that the prices are already cheaper than foreign rice, and the shops are still willing to stock up, so the prices of both thick and thin japonica have been able to increase by two yuan. Changbang Qingpi Zhente Japonica is seeing 128 yuan per dan, Special Japonica 126 yuan, Kunshan dan seeing Special Japonica 125 yuan, the next grade 120 yuan, Qingjiao dan seeing thin rice 117 yuan. Glutinous rice saw foreign rice continue to rise in the early market and once tightened along with it, but then it also followed the decline, and the result was a settlement with one rise and one fall. The prices quoted were similar to before.

### Foreign Flour's Rising Momentum Slightly Checked

Flour: Yesterday, the rising momentum of foreign flour was slightly checked. Since Thailand controlled the export of rice and the Soviet Union and Japan signed a treaty, market prices rose quite rapidly, and the prices of various goods have all jumped out of the 30 yuan mark. However, some "kick the ball" trades, profit-taking retailers, have slightly closed out their positions, so the market lacks the momentum to rise. Huaniao Brand Australian flour has eased back to 30.05 yuan, and Jinlong Brand Kan flour has fallen from 30.03 yuan to 30 yuan, a slight retreat after a large rise. Factory flour is still 25 yuan, but the factory is said to be facing a shortage of raw materials and may stop supplying, and is currently trying to find a solution.

A large amount of flour is exported. There are 85,000 bags of flour on the Taikoo Company's Liangzhou, which will be shipped to Tianjin today. Another 22,000 bags are on the Hanyang, which will be exported this afternoon and shipped to Xiamen. All of the above flour is Australian goods. Yesterday, the Java Company's Zhibisha arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 1,000 bags of wheat from Java, which is currently being unloaded at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. (Zu)

Wheat: Still not breaking free from a firm and quiet situation. The supply of inland Dumai has been dry for a long time, and there are only occasional scattered arrivals, in very small quantities, which are mostly taken by Japanese factories. The price is still between 45 and 46 yuan. Market buying interest is still invisibly stagnant.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans and Corn, Actual Sales Can't Afford It

Yesterday's market for yellow soybeans and corn was weak due to sluggish actual sales. Corn fell by about one yuan. Transactions involved 1,300-1,400 bags of spot goods (market details in the market price column), and 250 tons of futures. Yellow soybeans settled about 1,000 bags. Soybean oil fell first and then stabilized, with 500 barrels of Dalian spot oil traded, priced from 154 yuan to 156 yuan. Over 1,000 barrels were ordered for delivery in late April, priced from 154.5 yuan, falling to 53.5 yuan, then rising to 56.25 yuan, and later settling at 55.75 yuan. Another 50 pieces of Yanqi oil were traded, priced at 103 yuan. Peanut oil was flat. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, priced at 119 yuan. Over 500 cans of Jiangbei Benfang canned oil were priced at 160-161 yuan. Soybean cake also did not change much. The market was firm first and then stabilized, with actual sales slightly embellished, and speculation still accounting for the majority. A total of 13,000-14,000 pieces of both spot and futures cake were traded.

On the 16th, 670 bags of soybeans were exported to Xiamen, and 210 bags were exported to Hong Kong. Another 1,000 cans of raw oil and 240 pieces were exported to Hong Kong.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Difficult to Improve Temporarily

After a four-day holiday, the over-the-counter market for public bonds opened as usual yesterday. Because there were slight changes in the environment, such as the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, although it did not concern the overall situation, it did affect China to some extent. Therefore, the public's sentiment was very soft, and the selling side took the opportunity to temporarily stop, causing a plunge of almost one yuan. In the afternoon, because the buying side had a large appetite again, it rose back several jiao. At present, the market is originally due to the matured futures of the leaders sold by Yuxing in the previous few days, which is considerable in amount. The general buying side is already satisfied, causing the selling side to gradually feel powerless. There is no officially good prospect in the short term. The opening was small yesterday morning, with Hengfu selling very actively. Xie Kang and Jiufeng were also very eager to sell. Retail investors also sold more and bought less. The buying side, Tong Kang and Yi Tai, was more lively. Runhe and Xie also and Dingkang buying was also not weak. Although Zhenkang Lianhe and Tong Shun He Feng sold, the market was still pushed up by several jiao. As a result, the market only decreased by three or four jiao to six jiao. The total transaction volume was about 2,109,000. A concise table is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of Sanyou Industrial Society were traded at a price of 24 yuan.

When the public industry stock market opened, prices plummeted, and then gradually strengthened, and the market situation turned active, and transactions were extremely prosperous. The market softened again after closing in the afternoon, although it was higher than the morning opening price.

### Finance: Foreign Firms Take Advantage of Low Prices to Aggressively Settle Import Bills

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. Over-the-counter trading of British and American exchange was active after the holiday, but the state was still quiet, and the underlying trend showed a loosening first and then a tightening. This was because foreign firms had a large number of settlements, such as the foreign rice item, which had 500,000 to 600,000 US dollars (some say one million US dollars), and Japanese banks also bought in 200,000 to 300,000 US dollars. Therefore, although foreign telegraphs and local merchants were selling at first, it loosened to 3 pence 265625 and 5 yuan 34375 (bank selling price), but soon tightened to 3 pence 234375 and 5 yuan 28125. After entering, although there were telegraphs conveying news of British military defeats, and investment merchants sold again, Chinese banks still had a good appetite, resulting in a slight tightening in the end, contracting by zero one five six two five and zero three one two five compared to before the holiday. Speculators were mostly waiting quietly for the actions that Japan would take regarding the Soviet-Japanese agreement.

Large Foreign Rice Settlements

At the beginning of the morning, because the London Grand Cable was nearly far and long, zero six two five, New York silver prices and London raw gold remained stable, and the exchange rate of British to American exchange did not move, while the exchange rate to Shanghai fell by zero three one two five, and American to British contracted by a small half, and to Shanghai by a point. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 3 pence 25 for British gold and 5 yuan 3125 for American exchange, both without any honors or disgraces compared to before the holiday. After opening, foreign telegrams were selling, and local speculators also followed suit slightly, and the market hardened. The transaction volume for US exchange in April and May reached 5 yuan 34375 and 375. At this time, the bank's spot price of 5 yuan 34375 and 3 pence 265625 were willing to supply. When HSBC's listed price was announced, it remained unchanged, and the balance tax on silver was also announced as flat. After this, the foreign firm suddenly bought aggressively at low prices, and also had foreign rice settlements, and Japanese banks also competed to absorb, and the market suddenly tightened. It traded US exchange in the current month at 5 yuan 34375 and 3125, and US exchange in May at 5 yuan 3125. At noon, speculators also turned from selling to buying, and the situation reversed. At the tightest, US exchange in May was absorbed at 5 yuan 28125. At the close, the British gold was announced at 3 pence 234375 and the US exchange was announced at 5 yuan 28125, with the British tightening by zero one five six two five and the US by zero three one two five compared to before the holiday.

Speculation Turns to Stability

After the initial settlement, speculators immediately intended to sell due to unfavorable foreign news. US exchange for the current month at 5 yuan 3125 was thought to be sold, while foreign firms supported 5 yuan 34375, so the market showed a slight loosening. After 3 o'clock, Chinese banks came to collect and absorb, and the state was flat. US exchange for the current month was purchased at 5 yuan 3125. The results for spot settlement were all announced at 3 pence 234375 for British gold and 5 yuan 28125 for US exchange, with British tightening by zero one five six two five and US by zero three one two five compared to before the holiday.

### Gold Market Fluctuates, Unstable, Falls First and Then Rises, Spot Goods Also High

Yesterday's gold market, the cooked red over-the-counter market, the Tomb Sweeping Festival holiday has ended, and the market opened as usual. The situation was quite unstable, the changes were very severe, falling and losing, waiting for a sudden rise, returning to outside the 6,500 yuan mark, and the hearts of all parties turned from fatigue to firmness. Because the Soviet Union and Japan signed a neutrality treaty during the holiday, it caused speculation that the Japanese would soon advance southward. Therefore, at the opening in the morning, amidst a unanimous selling wind, a low price of 6,445 yuan was seen. Before long, foreign exchange suddenly tightened amidst the settlement of millions of US dollars in foreign rice. Securities traders, bill traders, and banks all rose up to aggressively enter the market. For a time, the short covering was tragic, and the price suddenly rose. In the afternoon, 6,583 yuan was seen. Suddenly, it was heard that the British army in Egypt had been defeated, and the Germans had launched a nerve war, releasing terrifying rumors. Bill traders and securities traders re-emerged, with a downward trend of more than 50 yuan. In the end, because the US dollar softened again, buyers re-emerged and came upwards again, closing up 59 yuan. A total of about 40,000 taels were traded throughout the day.

Xinfeng and Yongren competed with Yongda and Yuanlai to sell, and the price gradually decreased by 15 yuan, to 6,445 yuan. It was heard that foreign rice was being settled, and people's hearts were encouraged. Defu aggressively entered the market, and Dafengyi, Dahengji, and Gonghe also worked hard to enter. At 9:30, the price broke through 6,500 yuan. The number of buyers increased and did not stop, and the price was raised to 6,530 yuan. Tongkang and Yongxinfeng and Yong sold out, pressing the price down to 6,510 yuan. US dollars at 5 yuan 3125 were also difficult to settle. Xinfeng and Yong re-entered more than 600 taels, and Dafeng and Hengji also tilted in, soaring to 65 yuan, reaching 6,575 yuan. At noon, Deda continued to sell non-stop, and retail investors spit out, retreating to 6,555 yuan. The noon settlement was 6,557 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 pm, 3 yuan higher, at 6,560 yuan.

### Yarn and Flowers: Hong Kong Sales Active, Yarn Market Soars, Double Horse Near 1,500 Yuan Mark

The yarn market after the holiday suddenly rose, because Hong Kong dollars' demand for double horse yarn continued to be prosperous, and Xin Shen factory's lease problem has been resolved, starting from April 15, only 3 yuan per bag will be added, so the multi-headed is stable, and it has nothing to do with the overall situation. In addition, the foreign exchange rate has shrunk slightly, and the spot gold has risen, all making the bulls active, so the buying is , the market soared, and the high price of 20 count double horse was 1,494 yuan, and the low price was 1,432 yuan. At the beginning of the afternoon, 1,494 yuan was traded, rising to 978 yuan, falling back to 1,4812 yuan, and then rising to 1,4912 yuan due to large households dragging in. At present, the yarn market, because the price of 42 count yarn is too high, and the distance from the double horse price is too far, so there are buyers entering.

Double horse morning opened with mediocre popularity, because of the news from the previous day that the Soviet Union and Japan had signed a neutrality treaty, the bulls closed out, and the first market price was 1,445 yuan. As soon as this market opened, sellers rushed, but the market order was chaotic, and the shouts in and out were inconsistent, and it fell to 1,432 yuan.

### Recent Reasons for the Sharp Increase in Double Horse Yarn

The 20 count double horse yarn, which has been around for a long time, has suddenly soared in the past few days. The reasons for the rise are listed on the left,

(1) Before the customs closure, most people's hearts turned to optimism, because the factory's problem of increasing warehouse rent was not clear, and the prudent ones closed out to avoid the risk of the four days, so it fell from 1,455 yuan to 1,431 yuan.

(2) The newspaper reported the previous day that the Soviet Union and Japan had signed a neutrality treaty, and the market price was naturally looking bad. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange rate shrank again, the strips rose, and the 42 count line price was sold at 2,600 yuan, with a difference of 1,100 yuan from the double horse price. In addition, the sales of cloth recently have been smooth and the selling price has risen without falling. As for the raw materials, they are not loose, and speculators suddenly have a strong interest in the changing horses of Danbo, and buyers are coming one after another, so the market is soaring.

(3) In the past, most of the psychology was that the price of double horse yarn was too high, buying miscellaneous brands and dropping double horse. Therefore, there were more vacant horses in the field. Recently, the price of miscellaneous brands of yarn has been raised, and they cannot be cashed out. The double horse situation is tight, and the shorts are panicked and make up for it. Therefore, the bulls shouted wildly, it is not surprising to want to go to 1,5600 yuan, the fundamental problem is still thinking about the actual sales, whether the export volume from Nanyang is continuous.

### Flower Price Rises, Fine Velvet Rises Especially Sharply

The current cotton situation is rising with the yarn market. The raw materials for 42 count are rising by 17 yuan. Because the double strand line price has been sold at 2,600 yuan, the factory profits are rising strangely, so they are also willing to bid for raw materials. However, the spot goods on the market are thin, so people's hearts are particularly strong. As for the 20 count raw cotton, the rise is more moderate due to the relationship of Indian cotton. However, the future of 20 count yarn is optimistic, and the raw cotton that depends on it will naturally rise in response. According to this transaction excitement, the market price is rising step by step. Yesterday, the yarn factory and the flower number did a total of 2,345 pieces, and another 500 packages, and the price rose 5 yuan to 10 yuan. The current market price of traded spot cotton is listed as left,

Another message, the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai, due to the enthusiastic competition of all parties, the market is active, because the international situation is gradually becoming urgent, and it is quite difficult to purchase overseas, so the yarn market has soared in recent days, and the guests are all striving to purchase in order to transfer and sell, so the cotton market has also entered a lively state, whether it is the same industry factory, have the intention to purchase in large quantities.

The New York cotton market is active and firm, rising due to industry purchases and spot traders buying in, and the result is that the closing price is six to thirteen pounds higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market rose first due to speculators buying in, and then fell due to cotton merchants hedging sales, but finally rose again due to speculators buying in, and yesterday's closing price, except for flat low three ratio, the rest rose two or three ratio. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be higher than two ratio weak.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Soars

### Dried Goods: Xinghua Longan

Retailers Occasionally Selling Off

Xinghua Longan: Arrivals have been scarce recently, but retailers in the market are unwilling to hold onto their goods for long and are gradually selling off. For example, Xinghua goods priced at four yuan are occasionally being sold, a decrease of over ten yuan from the previous price. Other miscellaneous goods are naturally not expected to be optimistic. It is predicted that before the drying season, another small portion may need to be released, and prices may continue to ease.

### Changing from Monthly Salary Payments to Installment Payments

— Zheng Shixian

The cost of living index in this city has risen to a ratio of 1 to 6.8 compared to before the war. For the general population who rely on salaries for a living, their income is somewhat higher than before the war, but the proportion of the increase absolutely cannot keep up with the drastic increase in the cost of living. Therefore, the difficult living conditions of the general salaried class today are truly unimaginable to those who are well-fed and clothed. Under these circumstances, besides the authorities of various factories, stores, and companies considering the original difficult lives of their employees and increasing employee salaries or allowances as much as possible, I think there is another method that can help the salaried class manage and allocate their finances, and it is worth adopting by various factories, stores, and companies, and that is to improve the salary payment system.

In China's industrial and commercial sectors, employee salaries have always been calculated on a monthly basis. The payment period is also mostly at the end or beginning of the month. In the past few years, when prices were low and expenses were manageable, the monthly expenses of an average salaried family were only about 20, 30 to 100 yuan. The amount was small, and management was easier. But today, (unfinished)

### Labor Unrest Rises, Affecting Public Order: Labor and Management Should Accept Mediation: Maochang Optical Company Smashed Yesterday: Labor Dispute in Water and Wood Industries Scheduled for Mediation Within Days

Police Authorities Determined to Suppress Illegal Actions of Gathering Crowds and Causing Trouble

Rice prices rise without falling, and coal briquettes and all essential commodities have repeatedly increased in price. The lives of workers in this city are in imminent danger. In recent days, rice and coal briquette prices have increased even more, causing labor unrest that had been frequently resolved to become unstoppable again. Since the strike in the water and wood industries, due to the extremely large number of workers in that industry, social tranquility is greatly affected, and the situation is becoming serious. Labor-management disputes in other industries are still under negotiation and mediation by the authorities. To date, hundreds of thousands of people have gone on strike throughout the city. The management has repeatedly made concessions, hoping that the labor side will accept mediation within the lowest possible limits to maintain order. As for actions of gathering crowds, causing trouble, and forcing action, the police in the two concessions are determined to suppress them.

Maochang Optical Company Smashed

The store of Maochang Optical Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road was suddenly stormed by a crowd of workers from other eyeglass manufacturing companies at 3:10 PM yesterday, who smashed property and other items, causing a disturbance. Order was immediately restored, and business resumed as usual. The incident was caused by the fact that workers who make lenses in the eyeglass industry in this city have recently demanded wage increases from the management due to difficult living conditions, but were unsuccessful, and implemented a strike starting on the 6th of this month, which has not yet been resolved. However, some colleagues have harmonious labor-management relations and did not participate. Maochang Optical Company was one of them. As a result, sixty to seventy people came to the company at around 3:00 PM yesterday, without asking why, using stones and wooden sticks, smashing six large glass windows along Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road, and a large number of goods in the display windows. At that time, the Laozha Police Station, being nearby, had received a report and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to suppress the situation. The perpetrators scattered as birds and beasts when they saw the detectives arriving. As a result, more than twenty workers were arrested, and the cut telephone lines were taken to the police station for interrogation, pending referral to the court this morning. It is reported that Maochang Company suffered very heavy losses, no less than several thousand taels of silver.

Sasoon Group Hotel Industry Still Works Slowly: The Sasoon Group's Cathay Hotel, Grosvenor House, Metropole Hotel, and Hamilton House, etc., experienced further expansion of labor unrest yesterday. Waiters in the catering departments of these hotels have also joined the slowdown, forcing travelers to eat elsewhere. The management's attitude is also very firm, so it is difficult to obtain any hope of resolution at this time. According to their General Manager Ovardi yesterday, regarding the strike of employees in these hotels, what demands the workers have are currently unknown. This is because the workers have not yet formally submitted any demands. Yesterday, the elevator operators of the two hotels also joined the slowdown. As a result, the elevator operators of the two hotels were replaced by White Russians to maintain operations.

Reasons for the Slowdown

According to workers at the Cathay Hotel, Cathay Mansions, Metropole Apartments, and Hamilton House, the reason for the strike is, "We have all been working at the Cathay Company for a long time, most of us from the opening until now. Usually, we are very dedicated in our work, so labor and management have been able to get along until now. In these extraordinary times, the cost of living is increasing every day, but our wages are only 26 yuan, plus a rice subsidy of over 30 yuan, totaling only about 60 yuan. And in a month, there are only three weeks of work, and one week is off. During the off week, wages and rice subsidies are deducted. In today's high-priced era, how can these meager amounts maintain our lives? Therefore, in the past few months, we asked the management for a salary increase, but the management did not approve it. We decided to apply to the management based on the spirit of labor-management mutual benefit and allow four conditions:

Four Conditions

(1) Salaries below 35 yuan will be increased by 100%, and those above 35 yuan will be increased by 75% (calculated according to the March salary of this year). (2) Employees should not be dismissed or laid off for no reason, and laid-off employees should be reinstated. (3) Temporary living allowance of 20 yuan (including coal subsidy). (4) The rice subsidy will remain the same at one and a half dou. Representatives were elected to earnestly request the management to give a sincere reply: However, it was not accepted at all. We could not bear the oppression of the management and were forced to all leave our jobs and wait for the management to give us a fair answer. The above situation is what we have experienced."

Water and Wood Industry Labor Dispute Will Be Negotiated Immediately

The water and wood industry workers in this city number in the tens of thousands, originally divided into the two concessions and Zhabei, with slight differences in wages. Carpenters are paid one jiao less than plasterers. Since the cost of living in Shanghai has soared, rice subsidies have already been universally increased. The demands now being made have been approved by the management for an increase of 90%. However, some workers believe that the wages increased by the management are not enough to maintain their livelihood and forced a strike, causing the labor unrest to gradually expand. The association has already submitted reports to the Public Works Department and the Directorate of Public Works for investigation. Currently, all construction projects in the city are at a standstill. It is reported that labor and management will negotiate again today.

Moving Companies Resume Work Today

The 800 drivers and laborers of the Mao Tai and Shanghai moving companies, who went on strike on the 10th due to demands for wage increases not being met, have now learned that the labor representative Qian, Tang Genfa, etc., met with the management representative Wang Youtang on the afternoon of the 15th, after negotiations, a satisfactory solution has been reached. In addition to accepting eight conditions, the management also agreed to pay wages as usual during the strike period. Therefore, the labor side has scheduled to resume work today. It is reported that the four companies of Taiping, China, Wing On, and Shangtian have not yet accepted negotiations, so the labor unrest is still difficult to resolve.

Difficulty in Resuming Work at Datong Tobacco Factory

The Datong Tobacco Factory at 837 Hart Road, in January of this year, because all the stoves were old and could not be used, a plan was made to replace them all with new ones. However, during the shutdown period, the factory paid a subsidy of six jiao per day. All the installation was completed on the first of this month, and work began on the 8th of this month. On the 13th of this month, dozens of male and female workers in the cutting department of the factory made nine wage increase requests to the factory. However, the factory stated that it had not yet started work, so it indicated that it had absolutely no room for consideration of the demands made by the labor side.

Foreign Taxpayers: Annual Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow: Special Meeting to Discuss Organizational Changes to Be Held First: Shanghai Municipal Council Released Agendas for Two Meetings Yesterday

Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to change the organization and establish a temporary board of directors to exercise its powers, Consul General Hill, the leading consul, has scheduled a special meeting of foreign taxpayers to be held at the Race Club on Jing'an Temple Road at 2:30 PM tomorrow (the 17th) to discuss the matter. The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Keswick, has also formally informed the Chinese Taxpayers Association of this proposal by letter.

It is expected that this formal reply will arrive in Shanghai soon. The agenda for the special meeting and annual meeting of foreign taxpayers, after being edited and revised by the Shanghai Municipal Council, was officially announced last night. The details are recorded below:

### Special Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers

Special Meeting to Discuss Organizational Changes to Be Held First: Shanghai Municipal Council Released Agendas for Two Meetings Yesterday

Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to change the organization and establish a temporary board of directors to exercise its powers, Consul General Hill, the leading consul, has scheduled a special meeting of foreign taxpayers to be held at the Race Club on Jing'an Temple Road at 2:30 PM tomorrow (the 17th) to discuss the matter.

Japanese Residents Also Hope the Situation Will Improve

The English-language *North China Daily News* reported that a certain official of the Shanghai Municipal Council told reporters this morning (the 15th) that the new organization proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Council has been endorsed by the Japanese side. Therefore, there is hope for improvement in the overall situation of the International Settlement, and the area north of Suzhou Creek may return to the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The enthusiasm of Japanese residents in this area to see Shanghai return to normalcy is no less than that of other foreign nationals. Therefore, there is considerable hope for an adjustment of the current situation in the near future.

Police Authority in the Northern District Has Not Yet Been Resolved

It is said that one of Miura's proposals is to establish a separate police district in the Hongkou District, with a Japanese police officer as the director and a British police officer as the deputy director, but still under the jurisdiction of the Police Department. At that time, the negotiations were proceeding smoothly. Later, the negotiations were suspended, and as a result, there has been no second discussion since August of last year. At the same time, it is learned that public utilities such as the Shanghai Tramways Company have requested permission from the Japanese authorities to take back the tram operation rights in the northern district of the Public Concession. Currently, 280 "Huazhong Public Motorcars" operate in the area north of Suzhou Creek, carrying passengers. These public cars have neither special licenses nor have they paid registration fees to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Moreover, the drivers of these public cars do not hold driver's licenses. In the event of an accident, they treat the law like a piece of discarded shoe. Furthermore, passengers on these public cars are often subjected to insults and scolding. In addition, there are pedicabs seeking donations and registration fees operating in the northern district of the Public Concession. Pedicabs and rickshaw pullers often have disputes and conflicts on the road, hindering traffic, and the Japanese authorities turn a blind eye to them.

### Sharply Raising Prices Endangers Public Order: Secret Investigation Completed: Legal Action to Be Taken After the Situation Calms Down: Another 110,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived Yesterday and the Day Before

In this city, due to the special environment, those who disregard the livelihood of ordinary people and social order recklessly manipulate the market, sharply raising prices, especially for rice and coal, which is very distressing. The prices of all kinds of goods have been repeatedly increased by these people, reaching new highs. According to inquiries from relevant parties, the authorities are deeply concerned about the livelihood of both Chinese and foreign residents in Shanghai. Although they have repeatedly issued orders to suppress prices and urged merchants to consider the overall situation and not raise prices without authorization, these people are difficult to change their nature and obey in appearance but disobey in reality. For the sake of deterrence, since the launch of the secret investigation, it has now been completely completed and formally entered the next phase. It is heard that as soon as the opportunity arises, they are determined to severely punish them in accordance with the law.

Rumors in the Rice Market Subsided Yesterday and Remained Peaceful

The Rice Market Management Committee held a discussion meeting at the Rice Merchants Association yesterday afternoon, and made detailed discussions on several points such as unblocking sources, stabilizing market operations, and suppressing rice prices, but no decisions were made. It is learned that rice industry groups in this city are currently waiting for the authorities of the two concessions to promulgate various measures to suppress speculation and stabilize the rice market so that they can comply. It is learned that the amount of goods currently stored in Chinese and foreign rice warehouses in this city is the most abundant in two years. Moreover, due to the high rice prices, the general public is buying ground wheat and other miscellaneous grains as substitutes. Therefore, the daily flow of rice has clearly become less substantial than before. Judging from the current situation, the amount of rice in storage will definitely not decrease. If there is no sabotage, the food panic will not be difficult to resolve. Therefore, the authorities' thorough investigation of rice reserves and punishment of rice parasites cannot be delayed any longer. After the rice market opened yesterday, because rumors were proven to be baseless, people's minds tended to stabilize, and the prices of domestic and foreign rice rose and fell alternately.

More Than 100,000 Bags of Rice Arrived in Two Days

Rice prices in this city continue to rise, and the livelihood of ordinary people is worrying. Recently, the authorities have taken action to deal with general groups, such as thoroughly investigating stockpiles, setting deadlines for sales, and severely punishing those who violate the rules. After hearing this, the public was very satisfied with the authorities' handling of the situation and expressed their gratitude, believing that there was hope for rice prices to fall. Unexpectedly, after the announcement in the newspapers, not only did the prices fail to fall, but they even increased, causing great disappointment. It is found that the source of foreign rice is arriving in large quantities. In the past two days, a total of more than 113,000 bags of foreign rice arrived at the port. Therefore, the reasons for the continued high rice prices cannot be guessed.

### Japanese Training Paratroopers in Northeast Jiangwan: Many Believe This is a Sign of Japanese Expansion: One Japanese Regiment Recently Passed Through Shanghai and Was Transferred Elsewhere

The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM yesterday (the 14th), thirty new-style large Japanese transport planes participated in a paratrooper exercise over this city. This is a sign of Japanese expansion, but it is not yet known in which direction. During the exercise, many Japanese army soldiers descended by parachute over the skies north of the city center and towards Pudong. The Japanese airfield in northeast Jiangwan was closed to onlookers. However, the fact that Japanese paratroopers jumped from transport planes escorted by fighter planes showed that there was some activity in the area.

How They Are Equipped Cannot Be Ascertained

The Japanese planes flew to an altitude of about 10,000 feet before the paratroopers jumped. Looking from the boundary of the Public Concession, it was not possible to see whether the paratroopers were carrying special equipment such as rifles or machine guns. According to the villagers near that area who entered the Public Concession, they were quite surprised by the sight. The wind direction changed, and the "balloons" drifted eastward. Some "balloons" seemed to be in danger of falling into the Huangpu River. However, they did not know if there were any casualties. It goes without saying that there were no people's defense forces shooting at the paratroopers in that area.

Large Numbers of Japanese Planes Attacked Zhejiang and Jiangxi

It is found that the large numbers of Japanese bombers seen over the Public Concession recently were attacking Chinese troops in Ningbo, Zhapu, and Jiangxi Province. Observers saw that the Japanese planes were carrying as many as fifteen bombs, believed to be 250 pounds each. News from the Shanghai-Ningbo Railway area said that several Japanese regiments are currently heading to the Shanghai area.

One Unit of Japanese Troops Hastily Transferred Elsewhere

According to reliable sources in this city, a Japanese regiment arrived at the Yangshupu Barracks and boarded ships to be transferred elsewhere after only twenty-four hours. According to the Japanese newspaper *Mainichi Shimbun*, the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai, which had been lifeless and silent since October of last year, will reopen this month to strengthen the diplomatic front line in the Far East. Last September, Fotokhritsky, the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, secretly came to Shanghai and repeatedly met with Soviet consulate officials in Shanghai, Sherikov, Bachidin and other relevant staff. Then, it was decided to reopen and set up five sections under the Consulate General: General Affairs, Passport, Justice, Commerce, and News, which would be co-organized by five people dispatched from Moscow, five people dispatched from the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo, and ten people stationed in Shanghai. Now, in view of the changes in the situation in the Far East, in order to strengthen the Soviet diplomatic organization in the Far East, it has been decided to reopen in mid-month. The personnel stationed in Shanghai include Kurimiko, Arkus, Sherikov, and Ivankienko, among others. Their whereabouts are unknown. Yesterday afternoon, crowds gathered at the racetrack to watch the horse races. Suddenly, the sound of planes was heard, and they all looked up and saw 27 Japanese planes in tight formation, followed by another squadron of Japanese planes, also 27, flying overhead.

Many Believe Germans Are Involved in Training

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* also reported that Japanese army transport planes continued to conduct parachute exercises in the Jiangwan area this morning (the 15th). Some people believe that the Japanese army may soon imitate the methods of the German and Soviet armies and use paratroopers to fight against the Chinese army. Today and on the previous three days, large numbers of Japanese army transport planes, bombers, and fighters have been flying over Shanghai. Many believe that the main reason for the Japanese planes flying is to train Japanese troops here into a paratrooper force. It is also believed that several German "instructors" are currently assisting the Japanese army in conducting paratrooper training.

### Zhen Dan Photography Club: Extension of Public Health Photography Exhibition

The Public Health Photography Exhibition organized by the Aurora University Photography Club has attracted as many as 10,000 visitors since its opening on the 5th.

### Rotary Club Regular Meeting This Week

Moved to the Naval YMCA: Due to the slowdown by employees at the Metropole Hotel, this week's regular meeting of the Rotary Club of Shanghai has been moved to the Gymnasium of the Naval YMCA at 630 Sichuan Road. The date will still be Thursday (April 17th at noon). At that time, Dr. Marin, the Chargé d'Affaires of Chile in Shanghai and a member of the club, will give a lecture on his country, "Chile." It is reported that although the meeting place has been temporarily changed, it is expected that those who wish to attend the lecture will still be enthusiastic.

There is no regular sailing service. According to the Hongyun Shipping Bureau, the agent for Soviet ships, seven Soviet ships have arrived in Shanghai for repairs. Three ships have already returned to Vladivostok after repairs. Four ships are still undergoing repairs and docked at the Xiangfeng Shipyard in Pudong: Komiles, Soviet, Maxim Gorky, and Kovda, which arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month. The most recent ships to return to Vladivostok were the Svir and Smolny. Both Soviet ships departed Shanghai empty. Another Soviet ship, Volkhov, loaded four to five thousand boxes of tea when it left Shanghai for Vladivostok. The above three ships have already arrived in Vladivostok. The four Soviet ships that have not left Shanghai do not currently have a departure date. All ships came to Shanghai for repairs.

### Japanese Arrest the Wu Family on Ferguson Road; Seize a Radio Transceiver and Two Bundles of Documents; Detain a Visiting Youth and Take Him to Hongkou

Yesterday at 1:30 PM, more than ten Japanese plainclothes personnel, including one Chinese person, in three cars, two of which were military license plates (482) (187), and another black license plate (5139), went to the Louza French Concession Police Station and requested that detectives accompany them to search the residence of the Wang family at No. 218 Ferguson Road. The police authorities granted their request and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to accompany them to the address.

Searching the Wang Residence

Upon arriving at the location, the detectives and Japanese personnel knocked on the door and asked if Mr. Wang was at home. His family said that he was not at home. The Japanese personnel and detectives immediately conducted a thorough search of his residence, resulting in the seizure of two bundles of documents and a radio transceiver. After half an hour, the search was completed. Because the Wang person the Japanese personnel wanted to arrest had not yet returned home, they waited at the residence.

The Whole Family is Arrested

At about 5:00 PM, Mr. Wang finally returned to his residence in his private car, license plate (3136). As soon as he entered the house, he was arrested by the Japanese personnel. His wife, three children, three servants, and the driver were also arrested along with the seized items. It is said that they were first taken to the French police station, where they were detained for a while, and then Wang and his family were taken to Hongkou. Mr. Wang's name could not be investigated for the time being. According to a notice from the post office, due to transportation difficulties, all bulk and small packages to Hunan Province will be temporarily suspended from acceptance starting from the 16th of this month.

### A Thousand Cans of Kerosene Consumed by Fire; Owners and Craftsmen Burned

At 11:20 PM last night, a double-fronted tobacco and paper shop at No. 316 Mêling Road, Avenue Amiral de l'Orient, stored more than a thousand cans of kerosene. One of the cans had a slight crack in the lead, and the kerosene leaked out. The owner of the shop, He Guoxiang, immediately asked a coppersmith to solder the cracked area with tin. Unexpectedly, the kerosene caught fire and immediately burned fiercely, with thick smoke. The fire brigade rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire, which was finally put out. As a result, a thousand cans of kerosene and the building were consumed by the fire, resulting in huge losses. When the fire was raging, the owner He Guoxiang (58 years old) and the coppersmith Lu Rongsheng (26 years old) were severely burned. They were taken to Baolong Hospital by ambulance for treatment. Both are in serious condition and their lives may be in danger.

### Passengers from Detained Zhoushan Ships Disembark One After Another

A total of five merchant ships have been detained in the waters of Zhoushan, some for more than two months. The release date is still unknown. Yesterday, it was learned that some of the passengers on these ships had disembarked in Zhoushan and transferred to other ships to Shanghai. According to passengers, the foreign ships detained in Zhoushan are still the Meifu, Changde, Ammanli, Jiangsu, and Afumariya. Except for the Changde and Avimariya, which only carried cargo, the other ships also carried passengers. Initially, the Japanese side prohibited passengers from disembarking, but the food and fuel supplies on the ships were limited. The passengers were stranded on the ships and almost had nothing to eat. At one point, local enthusiastic people raised funds to provide relief. After several negotiations with the Japanese side, they were recently allowed to disembark, but the crew members were still not allowed to leave the ships, and the cargo was not allowed to be unloaded.

### Japanese Military Police, Together with the Police, Attempt to Arrest He Yuanming; He Escapes Arrest Because he is Out; They Depart After Conducting a Search

Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in this city dispatched several plainclothes military police officers in a car to the Louza French Concession Police Station, requesting that Chinese and Western detectives accompany them to No. 8, Lane 291, Route de Guignes, to arrest the accountant He Yuanming. When the Japanese military police and detectives arrived at He's residence, He had already left, so he was not arrested. After questioning his family and conducting a search, they found no important documents. The military police then left. The two lawyers, Yao Yunbo and Zhang Hongwei, and the former principal of Qianwu Lun Girls' High School, Zhu Lin, and Tong Muge, a teacher at Minli Girls' High School, who were arrested recently, are currently detained in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Hongkou. It is said that the investigation has begun, but the reasons for the arrest are still unclear.

The Chinese and Western detectives of the Jing'an Temple Police Station previously arrested Zhou Jinwen, Zhu Fayun, and Zhang Meili, a woman from the Guangming Guidance Society, and other men and women, fourteen in total, who were involved in a plot to kidnap the Yanliao tycoon Bei Runsheng and his son Bei Yikun. It was discovered that they had also committed the crimes of kidnapping Yao Dexin, the manager of the Ba Xian Qiao branch of the Kenye Bank, and armed robbery. They were sent to the Special First Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu took his seat in the Second Criminal Court and sentenced the defendants as follows: Zhu Fayun, seven years in prison; Chen Changcai, six years in prison; Zhang Xiaomao, five years in prison; Gao Zhiyun and Chen Shaoqing, four years in prison each; Deng Xiujin, three years and six months in prison; Chen Furong and Gong Fucheng, one year in prison each; Zhou Jinwen and Yao Jiansheng, ten months in prison each; Wang Yilong, Xu Mingzhong, Xu Mingrong, six months in prison each; Zhang Meili, two months in prison.

Plotting to Kidnap Yao Juyan; Extorting He Yingjie

The Chinese detective team led by Shan Zhaoxian, Gao Yongan, and Zhou Wenqing of the Lao Zha Police Station previously arrested five people, including Pang Ying (nicknamed Xiao Hei Hui) from Qingpu, Zhou Axing from Changzhou, Shen Zhongbao from Jiangbei, Wang Enzong from Shanghai, and a woman named Shen Wangshi, at No. 24 Jinyecun, Yidingpan Road, and No. 14, Lane 229, Weihaiwei Road. A pistol and five bullets were seized. They were sent to the Special First Court for interrogation. It was found that Pang and others had kidnapped Dr. Yao Juyan at No. 869 Wuding Road at 6:00 PM on October 18 of last year and demanded a ransom. However, the bandits' vehicle crashed into a manure cart while passing Route des Soeurs. The bandits escaped, and Yao narrowly escaped danger. They also sent a letter to He Yingjie, the owner of the Xin Ya Rubber Printing Factory at No. 26, Lane 434, Route Paul Henry, at 2:00 PM on February 1 of this year, attempting to extort 310,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Court President Feng continued the interrogation. The police lawyer Ru BaoYi stated that Wang Sizong and Shen Wangshi were found to be unrelated and requested their release. As for Pang and the other three, it was feared that they had committed other crimes, so he requested a postponement. Court President Feng ordered the release of Tu Sizong and Shen Wangshi and ordered Pang Ying and others to be detained for a later interrogation.

Sending a Letter to a Leather Factory; Attempting to Extort 100,000 Yuan

The Guben Leather Factory at No. 55, Lane 200, Guangdong Road, is owned by Zhang Ruzhou. At 7:30 PM on the 11th of this month, three young men suddenly delivered a letter to the factory, instructing it to be handed over to Zhang. The factory staff saw that the letter was bulging, as if there was something inside. They felt it and realized that it was a pistol bullet. They did not open it and immediately reported it to the lane patrol officer No. 1717, who gave chase and arrested Zhou Guiquan (23 years old) from Pudong on Henan Road. He was taken to the Central Police Station. The Chinese detective team led by Wu Chunrong, Yang Zhaoqing, and Tian Changyuan opened the letter, revealing an attempt to extort 100,000 yuan in national currency. The letter stated that a representative would be sent to collect the money the next day, otherwise "we will suffer a major disadvantage." It was signed "The First Unit of the National Protection Army." Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special First Court. The police lawyer Ru BaoYi stated that the police were currently verifying the handwriting and investigating the accomplices, so he requested permission to postpone the interrogation. Court President Feng interrogated them and ordered them to be detained for a later interrogation.

### American Soldier Kills Infant; Scheduled to be Sent Back to the US

According to the English-language "China Press," Private First Class Keithmon (22 years old) of the Fourth Marine Regiment of the US Navy stationed in Shanghai killed an infant aged one year and three months. The US Assessor Hallmic conducted an inquiry and found the facts to be true. He sentenced him to be sent back to McNeil Island Penitentiary in the United States for a long-term prison sentence. He will be eligible to apply for parole after five years in prison. Keith was removed from the US Marine Corps authorities on the 8th of this month and transferred to the Ward Road Prison the next morning. It is reported that Keith will board the Coolidge Victory Liner, which will leave Shanghai on the 22nd of this month, and will be escorted back to the United States by Mr. Pies, the US Vice-Consul stationed in Shanghai, who is responsible for the passport section of the US Consulate General in this city. He has been working in Shanghai for four years. He will take this opportunity to return home for vacation and escort Keith along the way. However, Mr. Li Quexion, the executioner of the US Assessor's Office in Shanghai, refused to confirm this news, saying that they were not allowed to disclose the movements of prisoners.

### Xu Xiaolan Sues Tong Yuejuan to Confirm Parental Relationship; Defendant's Lawyer Firmly Denies, Saying Father's Name Wan Jilu Passed Away Long Ago

Tong Yuejuan, formerly a Kunqu opera actress and now a movie star, has been married to the movie industry tycoon Zhang Shankun for many years. Recently, Xu Xiaolan (57 years old, residing at No. 35, Hequn Lane, Route Tenant de la Tour) from Hunan, through Lawyer Zhang Fukang, filed a lawsuit against Tong Yuejuan and Zhang Shankun in the Civil Mediation Office of the Special First Court, claiming that Tong was her biological daughter, originally named Xu Xingguan. However, because Tong and others did not acknowledge this, the mediation failed. This has been reported in detail. Xu still hired Lawyer Zhang to file a lawsuit against Tong Yuejuan in the Civil Court of the Special First Court to confirm the parent-child relationship. The lawsuit stated that the plaintiff was originally from Hunan and lived in Hangzhou. She married Wu Baozhen, and the defendant was born to them at noon on the 15th day of the seventh month of the Jia Yin year. Her name was Xingguan (nicknamed A Xing). Later, Wu took the daughter and left, and they have not been able to meet since. Now, she knows that her daughter has changed her name to Tong Yuejuan, has become a famous star in the stage and film industry, and has married Zhang Shankun. Because she does not recognize the plaintiff as her biological father, she is filing this lawsuit. (Zhang Shankun was not included as a defendant in this lawsuit). Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ni Wei'ao opened the Third Civil Court to hear the case. Tong Yuejuan did not attend, and Lawyer Yuan Yangan represented her in court, stating that Tong's age was 28, she was from Hangzhou, and lived at No. 543 Route Haig. The court then inquired about the facts from Xu Xiaolan herself. She replied that the defendant was born to her wife Wu on the 15th day of the seventh month of the Jia Yin year at noon in Xiaofen Lane No. 20, Hangzhou. At that time, she was working for the Wujiang County Government. In the Ji Wei year, Wu took her daughter and left, and her whereabouts were unknown. She once worked as the director of the watchhouse in the Shaoxing District Court. In 1934, a neighbor named Ding from Hangzhou told her that the defendant was performing on stage in Shanghai. She came to Shanghai once and went to the backstage of the stage to see the defendant, but she did not succeed. Later, she learned that she had married Zhang Shankun and had become a star, so she came to Shanghai to file this lawsuit, requesting that the defendant be confirmed as her biological daughter. Lawyer Yuan Yangan defended Tong Yuejuan, completely denying all the allegations made by the plaintiff. He said that the defendant's original name was Wan Xiuying, and her father, Wan Jilu, died in 1926. She and her mother, Wu, depended on each other. Later, she learned art from a teacher and changed her stage name to Tong Yuejuan. The plaintiff's request was like a bolt from the blue. Her biological mother, Wu, is still alive, but she does not know the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff's lawsuit has no legal basis and should be dismissed. The court then ordered the parties to go outside for reconciliation at a later date.

### Gambling King Escorted Back to the US; Seeking Pardon for Past Crimes; Lawyer Prepares Application; Signed by Foreign Nationals from Various Countries

According to the English-language "China Press", Jack LaLaine, the king of slot machines in Shanghai, was sentenced to 18 months in McNeil Island Penitentiary for operating gambling. He is now being escorted back to the United States on the President Cleveland. However, Jack committed a theft in Oklahoma, USA, and was sentenced to 25 years in prison in that state.

He escaped in May 1925 after serving only two years. Therefore, if he returns to the United States, he may be sent back to Oklahoma prison after serving his sentence in McNeil Island Penitentiary to complete his 23-year sentence and another 10 years for escaping from prison. Mr. Luo Qiu, an American lawyer in Shanghai who defended Jack in the US Assessor's Office, in view of this, is currently preparing to

prepare an application to submit to the Governor of Oklahoma, requesting a full pardon for Jack's past crimes. Luo Qiu is unwilling to disclose the details of the application, only saying that Jack's friends will sign the application this week. It is believed that more than a thousand foreign nationals from more than ten countries living in Shanghai will sign the application.

CHUNQIU (Essays/Commentary)

### Each Has Different Skills

— Chen Xinkui

Writing has "penmanship," fighting has "gunmanship," so how can a big businessman doing business not have a "rising method"?

There are many "rising methods," and each method is clever. The following are various methods that have been tested and have taken effect:

Steady and Sure Method - Raise the price by one cent today, wait two days, and then raise it by two cents. Then drop it by one cent, and raise it by two cents again. In this way, step by step, or take one step back and two steps forward. In less than two months, it will rise by twenty or thirty cents. For example, cooking oil, from about seventy cents to more than one yuan, rose up in this way.

Raise the Goods, Not the Price Method - The price increases slowly day by day, but the quality of the goods is reduced first. This is similar to raising the price in different ways. For example, with grass paper, when you buy a stack, you always feel that the number of sheets has shrunk a bit. It turns out that this is the trick.

Inferior Goods on the Market Method - Superior goods are locked up waiting to be sold at a good price. First, take inferior goods and sell them as superior goods. The price remains the same. This way, there is the practical benefit of raising the price without the bad name. Those who purchase the number one rice at the price of the number one rice should have learned this lesson well.

Want to Rise, But Fall Method - Rise and rise, rise in a daze. I simply don't even believe it myself. Sure enough, after rising sufficiently, business is no longer right. Then, let's turn a corner, show kindness, lower a little bit today, lower a little bit tomorrow. After three to five days, the hearts of the investors are moved. They are busy "digging" and "absorbing." So the price quickly rises again. This way, the store owner is proud because the price has risen. The speculators are also proud because they are sure that the goods will rise again. Only the poor citizens are extremely unlucky, buying one day, more expensive another. The current soap and matches fully demonstrate this posture.

Running and Jumping Method - Strangely enough, when the rising wind blows, business is actually better. The bosses are so happy that their mouths are always open. At this point, the well-written, one-tenth increase in price is no longer in line with the needs of the times. One can only greet and catch up by running and jumping. Please look at the price of US dollars. Although it often hovered around eighteen yuan within two months, the retail price of Mobil Oil soared from seventeen or eighteen yuan to twenty-three or four yuan per tin. Is this clear example not clear enough?

Great Rise and Special Rise Method - After the price rises, it must rise again, it must rise again, but public opinion does not allow it, people's words are terrible, so one must use a smokescreen. First, create a tense atmosphere, and then create a big rumor. Then, twist and turn and come up with a set of announcements. Everything is prepared and ready. Immediately, the United Front is launched. The word "horizontal" is at the forefront. Show a fierce energy, be bold, and ignore whether to raise it! Anyway, one will be scolded the same way. Raise it thoroughly, completely! This kind of rising method requires a large capital operation. Naturally, only rice and coal are eligible for such a qualification.

In addition, there are the "revision of price method", "united price increase method", "bitter crying method", "want money not life method", and "what method and everything method" ... The "rising method" of big businessmen is endless, and my "stomach talent" is small, and the space here is limited, so how can I write so much. Fortunately, the poor also have a "method". This "method" is called "forced credit purchase method". Believe it or not, we'll find out later.

### Ten Thousand Leaves Poetry Collection

(One sent from Holland) On the occasion of congratulating Yu on the publication of Jing Yuan Tang Poetry and Painting Collection

In early years, we shared pure conversations by the window, You held high positions and governed the nation, Your blessings, wisdom, and literary talent are unparalleled, Your talent and style are unmatched in the world. Searching for secluded northern homes thousands of miles away, Entering my dreams like the weeping lake, I pour a jar of tears, The phoenixes and cranes sing in the sky, I recall the spring river in the sound of painting eyebrows. Believing in the death of people and the exhaustion of the nation, My sorrow increases with time year after year, The three-life bond in vain neighbours the old, Leading the world in sorrow and toil, 廉政 is unparalleled, Grass and trees, weapons and soldiers, together with Du Fu, Separation and turmoil, sorghum and millet, different from Tao Qian, Exerting effort to be upright and brave, worthy of remembrance, One pillar resists the torrent, knowing it is dangerous and severe.

In Memory of Mr. Zhang Yunhe's Love of Freedom

Sheng

The great newspaper has a glorious history, High literary talent decorates Zhang, Writing flowers bloom in the upper seat, Spiritual aura resides in the new hall, The unveiling is like the spirit still present, Poetry and diction share the long love, The footsteps of Jin are now silent, The love of freedom is like a cool dream lamp.

A Sentimental Reflection on a Fine Day

Eternal grief fills today, Long sleep is contrary to spring, Before the terrace, the river swallows speak, Remaining dreams are like sea bubbles, The distant shore is hard to bid farewell, Filling the sky and wanting truth, Darkly, eternally, Blowing tears fill the handkerchief.

### Letters from Sichuan

— Scholar

—Telling You About Some Living Conditions—

The business of secondhand shops is most developed in Sichuan, all arising in response to needs. Prices are shockingly high; ordinary salaried workers can't afford new goods, so they have to go to secondhand shops to find what they need. As a result, secondhand shops are everywhere. Within half a year, more than seventy have opened in Chengdu, and more than ten have opened in Leshan within two months. This is a money-making business with no investment. People with used goods entrust them to secondhand shops to sell on their behalf, and the shopkeeper earns a large commission after the sale. Every one of these shops makes money, but they will all gradually close down later. One reason is that there are too many such shops; the second is that the items brought from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have now decreased; postal items have also decreased; and the lack of secondhand goods makes it impossible to do business.

Two years ago, I bought a set of Zhanghua gray serge suits in Leshan for fifty yuan. After wearing them for two years, the rear of the trousers was about to be worn through. Recently, I sent them to a secondhand shop for sale, and the result was that they were sold for 210 silver dollars. After deducting a 10% handling fee, I actually got 189 yuan. Wearing them for two years made me 140 yuan instead. However, when this suit was made, rice here sold for six cents a catty, and fifty yuan could buy 834 catties of rice. Now, fifty yuan has become 189 yuan, which is such a big interest, but calculated at the current rice price of 260 yuan per picul, I can only buy 127 catties of rice, losing 707 yuan instead.

When I first arrived in Leshan, a haircut only cost eight cents, and a bath only cost twenty cents. Last November, haircuts and baths still only cost fifty cents each. Now, a single haircut costs three yuan, applying yellow Vaseline costs an additional sixty cents, applying white Vaseline costs an additional one yuan, shampooing costs an additional one yuan, a back massage costs an additional one yuan, and applying Florida Water or Snow Cream costs an additional one yuan. A single bath costs five yuan, a back scrub costs an additional five yuan, a full body scrub costs an additional ten yuan, and a pedicure costs an additional six yuan. If you want to use charcoal to warm the cold water, it costs an additional three yuan. In just four short months, the changes are so great. I originally got a haircut twice a month, but now I have to change to once every forty days. I used to take a bath once a week, but now I'll have to give it up forever. University professors are not as good as craftsmen and coolies.

However, apart from the salaried class, other people still get haircuts, take baths, smoke cigarettes, and go to restaurants as before, without any stinginess, and completely indifferent. What's most annoying is getting clothes made: the customers of Western-style tailors are now mostly some nondescript lower-class people, six hundred yuan for a suit, eight hundred yuan for a suit, a thousand yuan for a coat, letting the tailor boss set the price, almost without even haggling; while white-faced scholars are almost extinct, and if they want to add clothes, they can only go to consignment shops to buy secondhand goods. A Western-style clothing store opened by one of my teaching assistants and a Ningbo tailor now makes a net profit of six thousand yuan per month, which, calculated on an annual basis, allows each person to earn thirty thousand yuan.

When merchants invite guests, they often offer "Big Cannon Platform" cigarettes to their guests. "Big Cannon Platform" cigarettes now sell for 36 yuan a can here. Among the more than 200 faculty members here, not one can afford to smoke "British Brand" cigarettes. They can only smoke the incredibly spicy local sun-cured tobacco. (Letter of March 17th)

### Someone is Burning Banknotes

— Zhong Ji

Aren't they? Many people are burning banknotes. Even though they are very poor.

She or they, light the banknotes one by one, burn them to ashes, and the ashes fly in the air, like pairs of pink butterflies. Then they laugh, as if they have done something satisfying.

A stack of Hangzhou foil costs at least 1.2 yuan. Each stack has 90 sheets, making each sheet worth 1.3 fen in national currency.

The old lady next door bought six boxes of "yuanbao" folded from tin foil last night. I secretly calculated for her that each "yuanbao" is worth about 2 fen in national currency.

Aren't they! Many people are burning banknotes. I don't know who left the nonsense: "Burnt tin foil is currency used by ghosts."

During the Qingming Festival, even more people burn banknotes. You can only see smoke here and smoke there, and pink butterflies fill the sky. I can't guess what the psychology is.

### Begonia

— Tai Shou'ou

(6) The Crystallization of Love

When he was urged by several senior colleagues to rush to Shenyang to sing a show, he estimated that the date of Xiangqi's delivery was only thirty or forty days away. The problem of the child was on his mind day and night. When he went on stage, he couldn't think of singing the play with energy. In a four- or five-flower cave show, everyone else was desperately trying to stand out, but he almost forgot the words and almost couldn't get off the stage.

He stayed in Shenyang for five days. Everyone else was excitedly running around everywhere, but he only went to the Japanese concession once.

On the morning of the day he was leaving, Jin Daguo and Rong Kui and a group of people all went to the street to buy things, but Begonia stayed alone in the hotel, lying listlessly on the bed in a daze; he didn't know how much time had passed before he suddenly noticed that someone had come into the room.

"I've seen that you've been troubled these past few days, and I couldn't help but come to see you!" The one who spoke was Zhao Yukun, with a shaved head and an open collar, speaking very directly, moving lightly, and without a sound; more than half a year had passed since they last met, and nothing had changed, except that today it was still early, and surprisingly, there wasn't a trace of drunkenness on his face.

"Ah! It's you?" This was not what Begonia had expected, and he felt much happier in his heart.

"Who else would it be but me?" As he spoke, he made another funny face as usual.

"So, the grass-on-flying character in these few days' performances must be you!" Begonia immediately jumped up from the bed, happily took Yukun's hand and said, "You are really strange. After leaving Tianjin, you actually came to the northeast. What's going on?"

"What's going on? I'll tell you! I need to eat!" Yukun saw him stand up, so he lay down himself. "If you want to ask me why I changed this name, isn't it just like you changed the three words Wu Yuqin to Begonia?"

"I see you're doing pretty well, aren't you?" Begonia didn't stand on ceremony with him, so he pulled up a chair and sat down by the edge of the bed (82)

The Entertainment World

### After Watching "Hong Xuanjiao"

— Meng Gongwei

History is a mirror. The performance of "Hong Xuanjiao" provides the audience with what Hong Xuanjiao said in the fifth act: "This is a terrible memory, no, this is a lesson in blood!" The same is true for the China Travel Troupe itself. Hong Xiuquan (played by Tang Huaiqiu) said before his death: "Such destruction is also good! It can also let our descendants know a hundred years later that in the face of a strong enemy, if our own internal factions can unite with each other, understand each other, take into account the common interests, and move forward with all sincerity under a common desire, the future—is really terrible!" The excitement of the emotions on and off the stage is not without reason.

Wei Ruohui used his historian's Spring and Autumn Annals style in "Hong Guan Jiao" to point out the reasons for the demise of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (see "Before the Premiere"), and he expressed his infinite grief and indignation towards those like Yang Xiuqing who "wielded military power and monopolized conquests" to eliminate dissidents, sat idly by and did not offer help, and even did not hesitate to trap friendly forces to death, allowing the Qing soldiers to fulfill their wish to use Yi to control Han. He made us feel like we had swallowed a piece of burning iron, our hearts were burning, our tears were flowing, replacing the words that were too hot to speak.

Director Fei Mu is directing a stage play in Shanghai for the first time. He is a famous director in the film industry, so his directing techniques are different from those of ordinary stage directors. He pays special attention to the atmosphere of each scene, especially the fourth and fifth acts. The change in the atmosphere is just like what we have seen in his films, manipulating it as he pleases. The orderly and intense war scenes have never been seen on the stage before. If the greatest advantage of "Hong Xuanjiao" is the playwright's surging passion, then strengthening the theme without letting it become an unbridled horse should be the director's achievement. The application of film techniques to the stage has opened up a new path for the stage world in the future, and is one of the greatest gains of "Hong Yijiao."

In terms of actors: Tang Ruoqing almost single-handedly supported one act in the fifth act, which is her "killer mace." Tang Huaiqiu is an old stage general, but he has not performed a good play since returning to Shanghai this time. In the fourth act of "Hong Yijiao," he regained his brilliance, making people believe that his heroic spirit is still there. Shao Hua's Yang Xiuqing performed very well in the first two acts, but the third act was not suave enough. Ge Xin's Shi Dakai still lacked composure and firmness. Liao Fan's Zhang Changhui was sometimes overly rude.

The lighting in this play can be said to be very good, benefiting greatly from the structure of the Lyceum Theatre. Xiao Wu was very good in the fourth and fifth acts, but worse in the first three acts. If more people had sung the Man Jiang Hong song, it would have been better. As it is, only one or two people sing, which is not enough.

### Theatrical News

— Juexin

Xiao Yang Yuelou has been away from Shanghai for two years. His daughter, Yang Juping, has always followed him, but recently she has also reached a position where she can stand on her own, so she left her father to perform alone, hanging the "leading lady" sign.

They have been stationed in Tianjin for a long time. Now, they have gone from Tianjin to Shanhaiguan, and from Shanhaiguan to Tangshan, performing at the Yongsheng Grand Theatre. Cooperating with Juping is a young martial arts actor, Guo Yukun. They are both pillars of the stage, taking turns performing the main show.

A letter from a friend brought good news that Yang Juping and Guo Yukun have gotten engaged and have scheduled a wedding ceremony to be held in Shanghai in the second half of the year. Before, when they were in Shanghai, they were already very "close." Now, "lovers are finally united."

### The Performance Rights of "The Biography of Yang E"

— Tian Fang

Xin Yi Internally Designates it as the Second Work; Tian Feng Also Lists it in the Preview Repertoire

Amidst the performance of "Hong Xuanjiao" by the China Travel Troupe, we have also received a pleasant piece of news, which is that Mr. Wei Ruohui's "The Biography of Yang E," following "Regret at the End of the Ming Dynasty" and "Hero of the Sea," has been internally designated by the Xin Yi Drama Club as its second work. Moreover, the responsible personnel of Xin Yi are already making active plans, preparing to perform it in a short period of time.

We remember that Xin Yi's debut work, "Hero of the Sea," was performed during the most adverse days of time and place, but the recommendation of public opinion and the praise of the audience finally made "Hero of the Sea" have an excellent page in the history of the troupe!

Although the basic staff (including actors) of Xin Yi is weak, under a common will and a unified front, the public is willing to cooperate in terms of manpower and material resources.

At this moment, the Tian Feng Drama Troupe, organized by Tian Feng Company, also announced the news that "The Biography of Yang E" will be performed. Xin Yi, of course, felt very suspicious about this and immediately went to the original playwright, Wei Ruohui, to inquire. The result was that Wei Ruohui was also surprised because Tian Feng had not obtained his permission.

But according to news from Da Feng, "This has already been contacted with Wei Ruohui, and a portion of the payment has already been sent."

Whether there is a misunderstanding in the middle, we do not know now, but we only hope that "The Biography of Yang E" will be performed soon, and we do not hope that there will be a "The Biography of Yang E" dispute.

### Wei Ruohui's Original Letter to Xin Yi

Dear Sir: I have heard that "The Biography of Yang E" was transferred to Tian Feng for rehearsal and that I had received a portion of the performance tax in advance. The facts of the matter are slightly different from what is published in the newspapers. According to Tian Feng, the two plays "Empress Dowager Cixi" and "The Biography of Yang E" were announced in advance. I did not know about it beforehand, or it may have been that a friend acted on my behalf without informing me, which cannot be determined; because many of Tian Feng's responsible persons are old friends of mine. However, Mr. Zhao Zhiyou of "The Biography of Yang E" contacted me twice, first hoping that the play could be transferred to Tian Feng for performance, and second hoping that it could be performed jointly by Xin Yi and Tian Feng. I immediately told him that the play had already been announced by Xin Yi and that the approval of the Xin Yi Standing Committee was required. As for what Tian Feng's lawyer said at the reception for news reporters about Ms. Ying Yin transferring a "portion of the payment," I have not received a single cent, and I do not know if there is any error in this. I hereby reply to this letter, hoping you will check it. Wei Ruohui respectfully. April 15.

### A Collection of Brief News

Chapter 6: A Beauty in Transient Drunkenness by the Brocade Zither

Li Xin thought he had an opportunity to take advantage of and had a well-thought-out plan in his mind. So, on this night, he deliberately joked and flirted with Red Maiden, being particularly intimate, and wanted to have a moonlit drink with her. Red Maiden naturally agreed and instructed the kitchen to prepare some delicious dishes, opened a jar of aged wine, and sat facing Li Xin in the courtyard, drinking and chatting idly. At this time, it was between midnight and one o'clock, the moon was almost full, and the moonlight was very good, shining brightly in the courtyard. Li Xin and Red Maiden each drank two or three cups of wine, then Li Xin took out a dongxiao flute and played it mournfully, very pleasant to hear. After playing a tune, he poured wine again and urged Red Maiden to drink several cups. Red Maiden's alcohol tolerance was usually very low, but tonight she was very happy in her heart and drank several more cups. Her cheeks were as red as roses, and she was quite drunk. She said to Li Xin in a delicate voice, "I've had enough to drink and can't drink anymore. It's better to go to sleep early." Li Xin said with a smile, "Let's drink three more cups before we go back to our rooms, otherwise we'll be letting down the bright moon." Red Maiden was forced to drink by Li Xin and drank three more cups. She became so drunk that her words were slurred and she couldn't support herself. Li Xin then instructed people to remove the leftovers and picked up Red Maiden, pretending to say, "Why are you so drunk? Let me carry you to sleep." Red Maiden did not answer, her delicate body lying on Li Xin, letting Li Xin do whatever he wanted. Li Xin carried her into the room, laid her down on the bed, and Red Maiden began to snore. Li Xin saw that she was fast asleep. This was a rare opportunity. He could have killed her with one knife to eliminate future troubles, but because he had a month of love with her, and she had treated him with true love and had not treated him wrongly, it would be too cruel and ruthless to kill her while she was drunk. He only needed to escape down the mountain. After thinking about it, he pulled a thin quilt over her body, took some silver from the drawer, hid it on his body, walked out of the room, and gently closed the door. He went outside and stole a precious sword, wore it on his waist for self-defense. Fortunately, no one noticed. He quietly walked to the back of the寨, stole a mount from the stable, mounted it, and lashed it several times, galloping down the mountain. The moonlight shone on the mountain path, very clear. He descended from Qing Shi Mountain, put his hand to his forehead, and secretly rejoiced. (39)

### The Philosophy of Life in Struggle

There are only three weapons for struggle: knowledge, ambition, and courage. Cultivating knowledge, cultivating ambition, and cultivating courage are the skills of self-cultivation. The psychological construction of struggle has been generally discussed. If you want to obtain systematic thought and how to put it into practice, you can read my book "The Life of Struggle" carefully. Next time, I will change the topic to discuss the philosophy of action.
