### Japan's Southern Advance Intensifies: Pressuring Thailand for Military Cooperation, Japan and Thailand Establish Economic and Financial Agreements, Britain and the United States Discuss Possible Changes in the Far East Situation

United Press, London, 1st - Two independent diplomatic sources here reported yesterday, though not fully confirmed, that Japan has unofficially suggested to the Bangkok government that Thailand agree to military cooperation with Japan and join the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. According to reliable indications, the sanctions imposed on Japan by democratic countries will allow loopholes, allowing American and Dutch gasoline, British Indian American cotton, and other supplies to leak into Japan. It is suspected that Japan is willing to aggressively invade Thailand, forcing democratic countries to fully sanction Japan.

Reuters, London, 1st - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that regarding Thailand, the Far East situation seems to be solidifying daily. According to news received here, Japan has apparently proposed to the Thai government to exchange the entire province of Laos and the ancient city of Angkor for exclusive rights to Thai rubber and tin, and the right to use certain naval and air bases. In other words, the measures in this proposal are very similar to the recently concluded Japan-Vietnam agreement, differing only slightly in their starting point. As for the news that the Thai government has reached a financial agreement with the Bank of Japan and has formally recognized Manchukuo, it seems insufficient to satisfy the greater plans of Japanese imperialism. London and Washington are closely monitoring these developments.

United Press, Tokyo, 1st - Cabinet Information Bureau Deputy Spokesman Ishii announced today that Japan and Thailand have signed an economic agreement. According to the agreement, Thailand will lend 10 million Thai baht to Japan, equivalent to about 15 million Japanese yen. Observers believe that the agreement will allow Japan to obtain rice from Thailand. Ishii also stated that the Soviet-Japanese economic agreement has not yet been approved, as it still awaits approval by the Privy Council. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently studying whether to revise it before approval. The spokesman said that he expects the agreement to eventually be approved and that the Soviet Union is welcome to propose any amendments before approval. Ishii also said that the Japan-Thailand economic agreement was concluded by Yokohama Specie Bank and the three major Thai banks.

Reuters, Bangkok, 1st - A local newspaper editorial stated that if the British had military operations near the Thai border, the British authorities would always notify the Thai government first, but Japan does not. It is heard that a Japanese air base has been established just three miles outside the new Thai border, but the Thai government has not yet received official news of Japanese military operations. British actions are courteous and considerate, while Japan is completely unconcerned, and the difference is as such.

Reuters, Bangkok, 1st - The Thai Cabinet just held a weekly meeting yesterday, but in less than 24 hours, an emergency meeting was convened again at the Prime Minister's residence this morning. It is expected that the discussions will focus on the recent developments in the Far East situation.

United Press, Singapore, 1st - The Thai Consulate General stated today that Thailand has not concluded any agreement with Japan or Britain regarding Thai bases. The Thai Consulate General declared that Thailand will not grant bases to any country.

United Press, Washington, 1st - According to British Ambassador Lord Halifax, President Roosevelt met with him yesterday to discuss events in the Far East "and possible future events." Halifax declined to comment on the contents of the meeting. He also said, "The President also spoke with me about the future of the Soviet Union. Soviet troops seem to be fighting very well."

### Japan's Policy of Seeking Hegemony in East Asia Remains Unchanged

United Press, Tokyo, 1st - Finance Minister Oura Masatsune wrote in the "Asahi Shimbun" yesterday that no matter how much Britain and the United States increase their pressure on Japan, "Japan cannot retreat one step in its basic policy of establishing the 'Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.'" Since the outbreak of the "China Incident," our country has lost over 100,000 soldiers and spent over 20 billion yen on the mainland, aiming to construct a "New Order in East Asia" for world peace. Oura said that if Britain and the United States cannot coexist with Japan regarding the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere," then Japan will encounter more difficulties. He pointed out that the resolution of the "China Incident" is the most important factor in developing Japan's national fortune, and this is the shortcut to peace in the Far East.

### Japanese Naval Air Squadron Arrives at Saigon Base

Reuters, Tokyo, 1st - The first squadron of Japanese naval aircraft, dispatched after the Japanese landed, arrived yesterday in southern Vietnam, flew over the Mekong River, and landed at the newly established air base in Saigon.

United Press, Tokyo, 1st - Japanese newspapers reported last night that a squadron of Japanese naval aircraft arrived yesterday morning at an air base near Saigon. Although the Japanese army has entered Vietnam under the Franco-Japanese Joint Defense Agreement, the announcement of the arrival of aircraft there is the first of its kind.

### Philippine Army Completes Mobilization, Burma's Defenses Strengthened

Reuters, Manila, 1st - Mobilization is scheduled to be completed yesterday. Ten regiments of Philippine Army reserves have been called up for active duty. General MacArthur's headquarters is now completing the organization of staff. The big picture will be released this weekend. The number of reservists is estimated at 15,000.

United Press, Singapore, 1st - British Air Force authorities have announced that the British Air Force in Burma has been greatly strengthened due to the recent arrival of American fighter planes. There are many usable airfields in the forests. The British Air Force in Burma has many American Brewster aircraft, capable of both offense and defense. Official statements have been released that in the past few months, countless men and women in the Shan States (transliteration) have been building airfields in the jungles between the coast and the Sino-Thai border, from Lashio to Mergui. The last of these airfields has now been completed. These airfields all have all-weather runways and can accommodate fully loaded heavy bombers. Factories for repairing aircraft have also been completed, and comfortable dormitories for aircrew and mechanics have been built. The official announcement also stated that the location of these airfields provides Burma with the greatest protection against air raids from any direction. At the same time, it allows the Royal Air Force to have greater mobility in the Pacific situation. From Germany's attempt to ally with Japan to declare war on the Soviet Union, Japan was caught in a dilemma. Matsuoka's policy failed. Japan has now sacrificed Matsuoka to form a new cabinet and rebuild its strategy, but its policy remains unchanged. Regardless of the outcome of the war, Japan has nothing major to gain, and the failure of the Axis powers will lead Japan to destruction. There were many listeners, chaired by Sir Robertson, a British Member of Parliament who once served in the diplomatic corps in China.

### U.S. Gunboat Bombing Incident: Japan Agrees to Compensation for Losses, Welles Believes the Case Is Closed

Delayed for a full day before being issued, it was only this evening that a joint representation was made to the official spokesman of the Information Bureau, requesting greater cooperation. This petition, which was endorsed by the U.S. Embassy, hopes that the Japanese government will cooperate in maintaining the same living and working conditions as Japanese journalists in the United States. The requests are as follows: (1) to be informed in advance of the news being censored, and the nature and extent of the censorship; (2) Forward bases, to be retaliated by bomber squadrons, and can make the Royal Air Force's bases in the Far East more mobile. If the British Far East Commander Park Fang Yuan Master encounters the war extending to Malaya, he can transfer the squadron to Burma within a few hours, so that the troops can be effective in the most advantageous location. Buffalo fighters have been continuously arriving from the United States across the Pacific to supplement the small number of aircraft that arrived in Malaya a month ago, thus greatly increasing the strength of the British Air Force here. British Spitfire and Hurricane squadrons have formed the core of the British Air Force in the Far East. These airmen unanimously believe that the Buffalo aircraft are well-built.

### China's Contribution to Restraining Japanese Forces Cannot Be Erased

Reuters, London, 1st - Lin, a correspondent for the Central News Agency of China in London, recently stated in a speech at the China Institute that China's binding of Japan is actually defending the Pacific for the United States, preventing Japan from advancing south to launch a major war, and fighting against the eastern end of the Axis powers. In practice, China is an ally of Britain and a pillar of the quadrilateral unity of the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. The conquest of Vietnam is a prelude to the Pacific crisis reaching its climax. Japan's future actions will determine

United Press, Washington, 1st - Under Secretary of State Welles announced yesterday that regarding the incident of Japanese military aircraft bombing the U.S. gunboat "Tutuila" in Chongqing, Japan has agreed to conduct a thorough investigation and to compensate for all losses. Welles also said that since Japan has agreed to compensate, the matter can be considered closed. Welles had previously said that the United States was not satisfied with Japan's informal apology.

Reuters, Washington, 1st - Acting Secretary of State Welles recently stated that Japan's apology for the "Tutuila" incident is insufficient to close the case. The U.S. government is currently negotiating for a more complete response to the matter. It is heard that after the incident occurred, the Japanese government sent representatives to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to express sincere apologies, which was before the U.S. made representations to Japan. Shortly thereafter, U.S. Ambassador Grew was instructed to negotiate with the Japanese government, and the State Department also negotiated with Japanese Ambassador Nomura. Therefore, the Japanese government made a preliminary reply.

Reuters, Tokyo, 1st - Six American journalists here were given the opportunity yesterday to discuss matters of mutual concern regarding the news of the bombing of the U.S. gunboat Tutuila by Japanese aircraft, hoping to have a clearer understanding with the inspectors. (3) Please suggest that the Information Bureau and the Ministry of Finance quickly provide financial convenience to the reporters. (4) Allow the import of American food, tobacco, and clothing, with tariffs paid as required. (5) Allow reporters to install shortwave radio receivers in their homes and offices. Ishii seemed surprised by the requests and promised to do his best to help, but said that he did not have close contact with the Ministry of Communications, which is the main obstacle to this matter.

Editorial

### The First Week of Frozen Assets

The freezing of assets has reached a week. The United States initiated it, followed by Britain, and in addition to their respective territories, the Dutch East Indies also amplified it. The formation of an anti-aggression front is vigorous and seems to offer hope for clarifying the situation. But like a thunderstorm, like melting spring ice, it ripples without solidifying. Those affected by the collateral damage are turning into a general surge in prices, and the cost of living is rising again. There are complaints about the harm of freezing, and there are complaints about the impropriety of the measures. In fact, there is no use for these complaints, because freezing is a necessary measure. The temporary turmoil is a common occurrence. With proper handling, currency values will stabilize, prices will adjust, and life can achieve temporary stability. It is a pity that the purpose of freezing is only to threaten with a stick, not to actually implement it, so the pain and difficulty are not worth it!

In the past, when Chamberlain wanted to appease Hitler, he always thought of holding a whip in one hand and candy in the other. However, the whip could not be used effectively, and how could candy satisfy his heart? In the end, he damaged his prestige and lost his country. The repeated air raids on the British Isles were the inevitable consequences of hesitation and consideration, and of priding oneself on being experienced, prudent, and thorough. However, it is not to say that hasty action can be undertaken. Things must be planned before acting; once acted upon, then follow this to advance. To stop halfway, to abandon halfway, thinking that one can subdue a country without war, except for Japan's relationship with the Vichy government, there is no need to harbor such extravagant hopes. But now the United States, how can one not know that the weapons of war are changing daily, that strongholds have lost their solidity, that mountains have lost their danger, and that the vast ocean is not enough to be an obstacle. The war on the eastern shore of the Atlantic can endanger the security of the eastern United States; can the crisis in the western Pacific alone be maintained without harming the future life of the United States? Only those with a narrow vision and those who are content with the present can make this view. Even to regard aggression as a means of making friends, and to regard those who love peace and fear strength as a threat, is not only to confuse the objects of fact, but also to hold on to the old concepts of the thirteenth century, which is a ridiculous reversal of the truth. All this may be a contributing factor to the incomplete freezing.

However, the main reason for the incomplete freezing is the component of financial and trade concepts. American investment in Japan is huge, and the trade relationship between the United States and Japan has flourished year after year. The profit-seeking merchants do not know that righteousness is important, that national policy is important, and that when it comes to their own interests, they may disregard everything. Moreover, there is still the matter of American cotton and Japanese silk, which are related to the livelihoods of American farmers and workers, and they only worry that once they are cut off, they will suffer great losses and increase political friction. Although the Chinese government has repeatedly called for an oil embargo, it has been ignored, and it has often been boasted that if it were not for this, Japan would have already made advances. But what is the situation now? The Japanese have already advanced south to Vietnam. It can be seen that sharp weapons cannot be lent to others; once given, they will suffer the consequences. This can be seen in the bombing damage suffered by the Panay in the past and the Tutuila today. However, the Americans still do not understand, and they still regard compensation and apologies as a concern that can eliminate hostile actions, which has already been lost. There is still concern that Mexican oil will continue to be supplied as usual, which will not only harm the sales of American oil, but also lose the effect of the embargo. If Mexican oil is also embargoed, then the issue of buying Mexican oil must be involved, which is not what American merchants want. The more complex the issue, the more concerns there are, and the oil will eventually be shipped to Japan as usual. If this is the case, then the main trade relationship still exists, and the so-called freezing of assets has become an empty signboard. The Dutch East Indies had already abolished the oil agreement, but it had to change its plan and revise the financial agreement to make room for re-exporting to Japan. The effort failed, and this is all because of the desire for profit, the unwillingness to restrain oneself, and the reason for indecision.

Moreover, because Britain and the United States often take no action but use words and economic blockades to threaten, the Japanese are able to make preparations in secret. Although the details of the assets frozen by both the United States and Japan this time are not known, the Japanese may have made plans to escape and recover them in advance. Can American merchants with assets within the political sphere of influence of the Japanese make early preparations in advance, or even have deep concerns because of this? Furthermore, because Shanghai has a special status and a complex environment, British and American merchants still hope to live and do business in peace during the storms, and to protect their assets, so they do not want to provoke them to take risks, intensify their actions, and go against the trend. The actions are moderate, and the net is opened on one side, just like the black market in the past, where there was free trading without restrictions, or wearing a mask to deal with it, becoming a black market within the black market. Some also say that the role of the freezing order is to raise a large stick and stop them, but it can only stop them, and those who walk are free to walk. By this time, will those who have been stopped by this drink suddenly change their plans, join hands and walk together, and not be misled by dreams, will they be able to watch the future with eyes open? But the failure of the freezing order lies in its decision, and the credibility of Britain and the United States is at stake. A nation cannot stand without credibility, let alone the great powers of Britain and the United States. Knowing that there must be a way to make amends, this is only a temporary phenomenon!

### The United States Prepares for All-Out Economic War Against Japan: Oil Policy as the Last Card, Effective Blockade Will Strangle Japan

Washington - Under Secretary of State Welles and the White House remain silent on the oil policy issue. It is generally believed here that the oil policy is the most important issue and the last card of the United States. The Economic Defense Board was established today, and Roosevelt decided to implement an all-out economic war against Japan. The government firmly believes that this will defeat Japan. The United States has also drafted a blacklist of 400 Japanese stores and private businesses in South America, which will be announced shortly. The noose around Japan's lifeline will be tightened. (1st - Telegraph)

United Press, Singapore, 1st - British newspapers today again advocated taking more severe anti-Japanese actions. The newspapers pointed out that Japan is very afraid of a possible all-out economic war by democratic countries. The Straits Times declared, "Japanese propagandists announce that the blockade imposed by Britain and the United States after Japan occupied Vietnam will not be very important. This view seems not far off. According to the telegraphs of the past few days, it is enough to prove that the economic war against Japan has not exhausted the power of the democratic countries. Japan has already expressed its readiness to determine its retaliatory measures according to the severity of the anti-Japanese restrictions. What will happen if democratic countries exert extreme economic warfare against Japan? It is frightening to death. Unfortunately, those who determine Far Eastern policy do not understand the psychology of the Far Eastern people. We know that a lenient attitude will only be regarded as a sign of weakness and will further advance the aggression. We should exert our greatest strength to implement the strong hand of economic blockade, which is more able to preserve peace here than appeasement."

### Roosevelt Orders Organization of National Defense Economic Committee: Wallace Chairs to Coordinate Work of All Parties to Strengthen Economic War Against Axis Countries

United Press, Washington, 1st - President Roosevelt yesterday established a new "National Defense Economic Committee," chaired by Vice President Wallace, to strengthen the economic war against the Axis powers. President Roosevelt also established a new Bureau of Inter-American Affairs Cooperation, appointing Rockefeller as its head.

Havas, Washington, 31st - President Roosevelt recently ordered the organization of the National Defense Economic Committee, appointing Vice President Wallace as chairman, and the Secretaries of State, Justice, Treasury, Army, Navy, Agriculture, and Commerce as members, so that on the one hand, the President can plan all the economic steps of national defense, and on the other hand, coordinate the work of all related departments. The committee will also be responsible for guiding all economic activities that may affect national defense. Therefore, its main tasks are (1) to manage the frozen assets of Germany and Italy, and (2) to prevent the export of coal and other important national defense raw materials; only countries in the Western Hemisphere and Britain are not subject to this restriction. This organization is no different from a "National Defense Economic Staff Department." Well-informed sources here commented on this matter, saying that the responsibilities of the committee may include close monitoring of Latin American merchants who have been included in the U.S. trade blacklist. As for Wallace's appointment as chairman, it is because, as Vice President, he can serve as an arbitrator when there are differences of opinion between departments. In addition, Wallace has served as the government's chief economic advisor for many years and is most familiar with economic issues between the United States and South American countries.

### Japanese Freezing Order Applies to Australia, Burma, and Malaya

United Press, Tokyo, 1st - Japan's freezing of funds in Australia, Burma, and British Malaya has taken effect today. This is Japan's retaliation for the freezing of Japanese funds in the above-mentioned areas last Thursday. The government will issue general instructions to deal with special circumstances.

### 100,000 Japanese Troops Invading China Are Withdrawing

It is Still Difficult to Understand What Japan Intends by Transferring Troops to the North and South

Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman said yesterday that Japan originally planned to withdraw 400,000 troops from China to prepare for war in the South Seas and the Northeast. Currently, almost 100,000 troops are withdrawing. There are signs of troop withdrawals in Central China, but the exact numbers cannot be known at this time. Troop withdrawals in North China have already begun. Therefore, apart from Japanese aircraft bombing Chongqing, there has been little activity on the Sino-Japanese front. (1st - Reuters)

Chongqing - At a press conference this afternoon, a military spokesman said that judging from the recent state of quiescence on all fronts, it can be seen that Japan's attention has shifted from China to other areas. Japan is now planning to withdraw several divisions of troops from North and Central China, and one or two divisions from South China to the Northeast. Although the spokesman did not indicate the exact numbers and intentions, it can be said that the shift in attention is clearly visible. Regarding the Japanese aircraft bombing Chongqing and other places for several consecutive days, the spokesman said that the effect of this action is only to make the Chinese people know that they are still at war with the enemy. The spokesman said that the purpose of the bombing was to demoralize the Chinese people, but the facts prove that their hope is only a fantasy. (31st - Havas)

### Only Sporadic Small Battles on Various Battlefields in One Week

—War Situation Announced by the Military Affairs Commission—

Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission discussed that this week (July 25 to July 31), in addition to Japanese troops bombing the Chinese rear with aircraft, there were only sporadic small battles on various battlefields. A brief summary is as follows:

Both Sides of the Yangtze River

Earlier, a part of the Japanese army in Longquanchi, northeast of Yichang, invaded Fenshiangchang on the 24th, and returned after being severely wounded. Therefore, they gathered a total of more than 5,000 Japanese troops from places such as Songjiachui, and launched an attack in two directions in the afternoon of the 27th. One force attacked Chenjiatai from the north of Songjiachui, one force entered Jinshan to the west via Caojiawan, and one force attacked Fagouquan to the north of Longquanchi. On the 28th, they invaded Wujinshan and Changlingang again. The Chinese army inflicted another heavy blow on them. On the morning of the 29th, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and was already unable to support themselves. The Chinese army took the opportunity to attack and captured Changlinggang and then captured Wujinshan and Fagouquan. At the same time, a part of the Japanese reinforcements attacked Tiankengwo, but was repelled by the Chinese army. By the 29th, they attacked from Dangyang in the west, attempting to attack the Japanese army on the flank of the Chinese army, but were blocked at Jizishan, Santian, Tudiyingpan, and other places, and have not succeeded so far. In this battle, hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed and many spoils of war were captured. A part of the Japanese army in Ganzhi attempted to attack the Chinese army invading Henan from Yujinkou, Wuning at about 3:00 pm on the 24th. Taking advantage of the Japanese army being halfway across the river, they launched a heavy attack, and more than half of the Japanese army drowned and were killed. The rest fled. A certain unit of the Chinese army in northern Anhui launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army at Shatuji, southeast of Hao County, on the evening of the 23rd, killing and wounding more than 200 Japanese soldiers. Many munitions were also captured.

North and South of the Dahe River

(1) The Japanese troops in Yuanwu, Yandian Village, and other places in northern Henan invaded the north bank of Shushui Town on the morning of the 23rd. After a heavy attack by the Chinese army, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed and wounded. (2) On the evening of the 20th, more than 20 Japanese transport vehicles passed through Wang Village, east of Fenlingdu, in the triangular area of southern Shanxi. Many vehicles were destroyed by the artillery on the south bank of China, and the Japanese suffered heavy losses. Also, on the 22nd, the Japanese troops in Zhennan, who were riding in cars, invaded Shangzaochuang to the west along the Ruimo Highway. Another ambush by the Chinese killed and wounded even more. (3) A part of the Japanese army in Jiyuan attacked areas north of Liuzhuang on the morning of the 24th, and was heavily attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese army suffered considerable casualties.

Upstream of the Huai River

The Japanese troops who attacked Guancao Village and Yang Village from Quku near Xinyang in southern Henan have been continuously wiped out by the Chinese army. By the 24th, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and broke through to the south. The Chinese army is pursuing the victory. At present, there are no Japanese troops on the north bank of the Huai River.

Southeast Coast

(1) On the morning of the 20th, the Japanese army landed on the opposite bank of Xiamen and invaded Shalong and Yanting near Chaoyang in the southwest. The Japanese army engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army. By late at night, the Japanese army withdrew after leaving behind corpses. The original situation has now been restored. (2) The Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese troops invading Xidongzhang, Fuqing, and captured Dongzhang on the evening of the 11th, killing a large number of Japanese troops and retreating to the east. Now the Chinese army has chased past Honglu and is pressing towards Fuqing. (1st - Telegraph)

Henan Province, Chinese Army Attacks Zhuxian Town

Luoyang - On the evening of the 26th, guerrilla troops of a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Zhuxian Town and other places. They attacked into the fortress and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army. By dawn the next day, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed, more than 40 rifles were captured, and many military supplies were captured. (30th - Telegraph)

### Chongqing Officials Deny Chita Meeting

Chongqing - Officials recently denied the Japanese report that China and the Soviet Union would meet in Chita, but pointed out that if Japan threatened Siberia, Chinese law would naturally provide mutual assistance. (1st - United Press)

### This Year's Rice and Wheat Crops in Various Regions Expected to Be Bountiful

Chongqing - According to an announcement by the Grain Production Increase Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, rice is growing well in Bishan, Yongchuan, Yibin, Jiang'an, Rongchang, and other counties of Sichuan Province, with an estimated harvest of 80-90%. In Deyang, Fengdu, Zhongxian, Fuling, Mianyang, and other counties, rice growth is relatively poor, with an estimated harvest of 70-80%. In Hunan Province, except for slight drought in the eastern and western regions, rice and summer miscellaneous grains are growing well in other areas. In northern Hubei Province, due to successive rains, there is no concern for the autumn harvest, and grain prices in the market are also tending to stabilize. In Anhui Province, due to heavy rains in June and July, a bumper harvest is expected this year. In western Suiyuan Province, summer miscellaneous grain growth is poor due to lack of rain in June.

### Hong Kong Joins the Sterling Area, Announces New Foreign Exchange Control Regulations

All Foreign Exchange Held by Residents Must Be Sold to the Government; Chinese Legal Tender May Be Transferred as Usual Within Predetermined Limits

London - The Ministry of Finance announced that it has issued an order under the Defense Regulations to include Hong Kong in the sterling area. (1st day Reuters telegram)

Hong Kong - After freezing the funds of Chinese and Japanese individuals, the government has now announced new regulations for foreign exchange control. From now on, anyone residing in Hong Kong, regardless of nationality, must comply with the Defense Financial Regulations, unlike before when it was limited to British citizens. According to these regulations, everyone must sell all their foreign exchange to the government. At the same time, Chinese banks have stopped paying out and remitting foreign currency, but Chinese legal tender is allowed to be transferred as usual within the limits previously in place. The government announced the following banks are authorized to conduct foreign exchange business: American Express Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Mercantile Bank, Chase Bank, Tong Yung Lung Bank, HSBC, Chartered Bank, Citibank, Holland Bank, and Anda Bank. According to a Chinese banker, remittances to Shanghai not exceeding 1,500 yuan in legal tender per transaction can still be remitted as usual. Remittances exceeding this amount must be licensed by the government. Remittances will only be sold to people known to the bank or who can provide satisfactory evidence of previous periodic remittances. Legal tender forward notes will not be issued even by bank brokers without a license. (1st day Reuters telegram)

Hong Kong - The order regarding frozen funds in Hong Kong was issued on the evening of the 30th. Banks only learned about it after opening on the 31st, but without detailed procedures, the handling was inevitably chaotic. Banks consulted each other and generally advocated a cautious approach, so they mostly stopped accepting remittances to Shanghai. At noon on the 31st, the Hong Kong Financial Secretary announced to the banks the measures for restricting remittances to China. The main points are: (1) At the request of the Chinese government, the Hong Kong government has banned remittances from Hong Kong to China from the date of the order. (2) Banks are therefore prohibited from making such payments. (3) The above ban does not apply to transactions authorized by the Chinese government. (4) The above ban does not apply to individual remittances permitted by the Defense Financial Regulations, that is, limited to 1,500 yuan per person per month and 100,000 yuan per bank per month. In the afternoon, the handling by various banks became consistent, and the rush to withdraw and deposit funds calmed down. Foreign currency depositors at the Bank of China and Bank of Communications can pay in Hong Kong dollars. If they need the original currency, they can also issue drafts, but there is no guarantee that they can be cashed. Currently, HSBC has the same policy for Chinese depositors. American banks also pay drafts sent from Shanghai to depositors. Everything else is normal. All Chinese and foreign banks here are very clear about the meaning of the Chinese government's request to freeze funds and are mostly willing to comply. (1st day telegram)

Burma Freezes Chinese Funds

Rangoon - The Burmese government has ordered the freezing of Chinese funds. According to the gazette, this move was made at the request of the Chinese government. Burmese banks have the right to exempt the private deposits of people and businesses residing in the liberated areas of China and overseas Chinese residing in Burma from being frozen. (1st day Reuters telegram)

Singapore - The gazette stated that at the request of the Chongqing government, the Straits Settlements have frozen funds deposited here by residents of China from yesterday morning. Funds deposited in Malayan banks by overseas Chinese in Malaya, or in branches of Chinese banks in Malaya, are not affected. (1st day Reuters telegram)

### A Japanese Plane Crashes in Luoding County

Zhaoqing - At around 9:00 AM on the 29th, three Japanese planes flew over Luoding County for reconnaissance and circling. One of them was shot down by Chinese anti-aircraft units. The three crew members were injured and died resisting arrest. (19th day telegram)

### Regular Memorial Service for Tax Police Who Died in Battle

Chongqing - The Ministry of Finance's Tax Police Corps originally had more than 20,000 members. After the August 13th Incident, they fought alongside regular troops on the Shanghai battlefield. A total of 7,000 people died in battle. It is now decided to hold a memorial service on August 13th in Duyun, Guizhou, and to collect the names and deeds of the deceased officers and soldiers to provide compensation to their families. The most famous battle of the corps was the annihilation of more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers who forcibly crossed the Zhoujiabiao Bridge. (1st day Havas telegram)

### Chongqing Air Raid Rescue Team Works Effectively

Chongqing - According to official sources, the Burmese mission currently studying air defense in Chongqing has had the opportunity to conduct practical inspections of air defense. The day before yesterday, when Japanese planes came to bomb, the mission lingered at the air defense command post for most of the day. After the all-clear, they went to various places to inspect rescue work. Officials said that 130 Japanese planes raided Chongqing on Wednesday. A public air raid shelter was hit by a bomb, but fortunately, the rescue team worked effectively, and everyone was rescued. (1st day Reuters telegram)

### Guizhou Province Asks the Ministry of Education for Funds to Establish National Middle Schools

Guilin Provincial Government has requested the Ministry of Education to allocate funds to establish several national middle schools in Guizhou Province to accommodate a large number of young students withdrawing from the war zones. (31st day telegram)

### Transportation of Goods in South China Greatly Restricted

Tokyo - According to the Japanese news agency Domei today in Shantou, the Japanese army in South China has established rules prohibiting people, goods, and currency from traveling between the occupied areas and China. Permits issued by the Japanese army before July 31 have been cancelled. Chinese returning from abroad will not be allowed to cross the line between the occupied areas and the interior. (1st day United Press telegram)

### Women's Comfort Association Holds Commemorative Meeting

Madam Chiang Personally Presides Over Everything, Says Final Victory is Closer

Chongqing - The Women's Comfort Department held its fourth anniversary commemorative meeting at 7:30 this morning. Madam Chiang personally presided over the meeting, reported on the progress of the work, and said that the final victory is closer, and hoped that everyone would work harder. Next, the heads of various departments reported on the work of the anti-Japanese family factories and rural services. Finally, Madam Chiang presented awards. Individuals or organizations that donated more than 1,000 yuan were given awards. The two groups from the Philippines and Juigang, who donated more than one million, received special brocade banners, certificates, national flags, and horizontal scrolls with Madam Chiang's name. Representatives from the overseas department accepted them. (1st day Havas telegram)

### Detailed Instructions on the U.S. Freezing of Chinese and Japanese Funds Have Been Delivered by the U.S. Embassy to the Ministry of Finance

The Ministry of Finance and Banking Authorities are Currently Studying Them; American Journalists Staying in Chongqing will be Affected

### Governor-General of Vietnam, Decoux, Makes a Statement

Vietnam is Willing to Maintain Economic Relations with Neighboring Countries

Reuters, Hanoi - Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam told a Reuters reporter that Vietnam is willing to continue to maintain Far Eastern economic relations with Hong Kong, Singapore, and other parts of the ABCD powers, to the greatest possible extent, in accordance with Vietnam's important needs and the local terrain. Vietnam must obtain some necessary supplies from the above-mentioned places. Although these supplies are currently available, the quantity is not sufficient, and it is not easy to obtain them. The Vietnamese authorities believe that the people want to faithfully implement the policies of the Vichy government, but Vietnam also does not want to take any action that would make the international situation in the Far East more complicated. Although the Governor-General did not answer some questions related to the new French-Japanese agreement, he said that this new agreement came from the French government, and Vietnam could only faithfully implement it.

### U.S. Restricts Gasoline Consumption in New York

Reuters, Washington - To gradually force restrictions on the use of petroleum, Interior Secretary Ickes has now urged the oil industry to stop operating gas stations for 100,000 gallons in the eastern states from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM daily, starting August 3. Ickes claimed that if we want to avoid a more severe situation in the future, we must achieve the goal of saving petroleum. If the public's voluntary savings cannot achieve this goal, then more severe measures may have to be adopted in the future, such as issuing oil consumption permits. In addition to the Atlantic states, this method also applies to the District of Columbia and certain parts of five other states. When asked if gas stations that do not comply will be prosecuted, Ickes replied that he did not believe there would be any prosecutions.

Reuters, Simla - The Indian government has recently issued an order stipulating that gasoline will be distributed to households in India starting August 15. The government stated that when drafting this order, it paid special attention to maintaining essential businesses and fairly distributing gasoline for private use. It hopes that private car owners will cooperate and use cars only when absolutely necessary. Thanks to the careful planning of the shipping authorities and oil companies before this, gasoline reserves have been maintained at a level sufficient to meet needs. However, the government feels that it is necessary to prevent the possible reduction of oil tankers, so it is taking this step to store more gasoline.

Reuters, Wellington - New Zealand's Minister of Supply, Reiven, recently announced that the limit for private use of gasoline is eight gallons per month for large cars and four to six gallons per month for small cars, which will be reduced by a quarter from now on. The authorities are currently checking car licenses in order to reduce gasoline consumption based on the situation.

### Japanese Ship's Cargo Detained by the U.S.

United Press, San Francisco - The U.S. Department of Justice Enforcement Officer's Office issued a detention order yesterday to detain part of the cargo loaded on the Japanese ship Tatuta Maru. The cargo was scheduled to be exported yesterday. Personnel of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha said that it has not yet been decided whether the ship's voyage will be extended, but the ship may be detained until August 5 due to investigations.

United Press, San Francisco - The Japanese ship Tattuta Maru set sail today after receiving a notice from the Federal Reserve Bank. The Japanese ship had stayed outside the port of San Francisco for several days after the US announced the freezing of Japanese funds. This time, it was allowed to leave the port after the US government issued a settlement note.

International News Service, San Francisco - The Ryuta Maru of Nippon Yusen Kaisha was prevented from adding materials yesterday. The reason given was that the application did not comply with the US licensing system under the freezing order. The government said that the ship requested an excessive amount and had several hundred pro-Axis people on board, including 200 Chinese. The correctional personnel were monitoring the ship.

United Press, Honolulu - The Japanese ship Asama Maru arrived here yesterday. The passengers of the ship described in detail how they had the right to determine where to navigate while the ship was detained in the Pacific. Passengers said that after the ship was blocked in the ocean on July 22, it made aimless voyages. Passengers were not allowed to send telegrams and could only receive wireless telegraphs, because the telegrams had lost their normal state at that time. On July 24, the ship sailed north, but unexpectedly encountered dense fog. On July 26, a notice was posted on the ship stating that the Japanese government had ordered the ship to return to Japan. The ship then sailed home. At this time, the passengers on the ship did not know what had happened and suspected that war had broken out. The ship was driven at full speed and arrived in Honolulu. There were 186 passengers who disembarked here, and one-third of the remaining 170 people were also prepared to leave the ship here.

### German Troops in Smolensk Evicted from Their Positions by Soviet Troops; German Advance Blocked; Soviet Army and Air Force Cooperate to Inflict Heavy Losses on Germans

Reuters, London - According to reports from Moscow, fierce fighting continues in various areas of the front. The Red Army is continuing its counter-offensive and has evicted the German troops from their positions in the Smolensk area, forcing them to retreat. German troops have tried to occupy the city of Smolensk in 42 decisive attacks, but all have been repelled. The Soviet army has now blocked the German advance. Informed sources here say that the outcome of the Battle of Smolensk will depend on whether the German side can mobilize a sufficient number of fresh troops and armored vehicles to break through Soviet resistance, and whether the Soviet army can hold its ground and launch a fierce counter-offensive to exhaust the enemy. According to pro-German Swedish newspapers, German troops on the Finnish front are currently encountering major difficulties and making slow progress. The newspaper also quoted Finnish battlefield reports as saying that major victories or major annihilation battles can be reported in the area.

According to Soviet communiqués, German planes twice attempted to attack Leningrad last night but were repelled. German planes also failed in their attempts to attack Moscow. German communiqués on the Smolensk battle acknowledged that Soviet infantry and tanks had launched attacks, but claimed they had been repelled.

This morning, the Soviet Information Bureau issued the following communiqué: "On July 31, Soviet troops continued to fight the enemy in the areas mentioned in the morning communiqué. The fighting was particularly fierce in the Smolensk area. Soviet troops in the area launched successive counter-offensives, evicting the enemy from their positions, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, capturing some prisoners, and obtaining many war materials. The Soviet Air Force and Army cooperated to strike the enemy's mechanized and motorized units and infantry. On July 31, 15 German planes were shot down in air combat, and the Soviets lost seven planes. Soviet dive bombers attacked two German patrol boats in the Baltic Sea. One boat was hit and sank, and the other was also severely damaged and escaped under a smokescreen. Nine bombers and three fighters were destroyed on enemy airfields behind the lines.

The Communist Party newspaper Pravda summarized the first five weeks of the Soviet-German war, saying that Hitler's plan to occupy Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev at lightning speed has failed. The elite Nazi divisions have been repeatedly annihilated. A large number of German tanks, aircraft, and other war materials have been destroyed. The German soldiers' sense of victory has begun to waver, and the German public is becoming confused by the failures. Time is on the side of the Soviet Union. The Soviet army's ability to resist the enemy is growing stronger day by day, while Germany's offensive and striking power is gradually weakening. Currently, in various areas of the front, enemy troops are constantly being forced to switch from offense to defense. German propaganda has recently changed its tone and no longer emphasizes the value of occupied land. The Soviet public is very clear that this is due to the heroic resistance of the Red Army. The current successful counter-offensives of the Soviet army are only the beginning of the fascist bandits encountering powerful blows in quick succession.

Reuters, London - German propaganda reports that fierce fighting continues around Smolensk 15 days after its occupation, making the news that the Red Army has disrupted the Nazi war machine more credible. Although the claim that the Soviet Union has launched a large-scale counter-offensive cannot yet be confirmed, judging from the continuous blows given to the Germans by the Soviet army, the date for a decisive battle in Smolensk is not far off. There is no new news in either side's war reports, but judging from between the lines, it seems undeniable that the German offensive has been curbed. According to responsible sources in London, the lack of war news may indicate that the German army is preparing a new offensive. However, each time the German army is forced to reorganize and re-launch an offensive, the difficulties it encounters also increase accordingly. It is estimated that the German army has so far used at least half of its armored divisions, and both soldiers and materials have suffered extremely heavy losses. At the same time, the distance to the rear transportation line is also becoming more and more distant, so any new offensive will inevitably be weaker than before.

United Press, Moscow - Last night was the eighth attempt by German planes to attack Moscow in 11 days, but the result was still a failure. Only a few German planes penetrated the strong defenses and dropped bombs. The number of bombs dropped was very small, and none damaged military targets. The alarm in the Soviet capital started at 10:40 PM and lasted for three hours. Judging from last night's German air raid, the Soviet defense had a significant effect, because most German planes failed to break into the capital to carry out their bombing. The German planes came in several waves, but the intense anti-aircraft fire and Soviet fighters stopped and drove away most of the German planes. Only one or two German planes broke through the Soviet defense line. Some houses in the Soviet capital were burned by a few incendiary bombs, but the fires were quickly extinguished.

United Press, Moscow - Soviet officials announced yesterday that fighting was still taking place in the Smolensk, Zhitomir, and Novochav areas. Soviet troops apparently still hold the lines. The announcement was the first this week to mention the resumption of fighting in the Pokov area, indicating that the German advance towards Leningrad has made no progress. It also stated that there were minor engagements on other lines. It was also stated that Red Army fighters shot down 110 German first-line bombers this week. These planes originally attempted to raid Moscow and Leningrad.

United Press, Rome - The official news agency "Stefani" yesterday announced news from the Romanian capital that an increasing number of Italian troops heading towards the Soviet front are continuing to cross Hungary.

### Budyonny Calls on Guerrillas to Intensify Cooperation in Annihilating the Enemy

United Press, New York - It was heard that the Soviet Red Army launched a major counter-offensive against the German army east of Smolensk yesterday. At the same time, Britain carried out an air raid on the Arctic to help its allies. American aid administrator Hopkins is negotiating the needs of the Red Army in Moscow. Marshal Butni, commander of the Southwest Front, was heard to have issued a declaration on the Moscow radio, saying that the Soviet Union had sent a powerful reinforcements, so that the Red Army could give the German army a heavy blow. Marshal Butni called on the Soviet people in the occupied areas to intensify their guerrilla activities and cooperate in "destroying" the enemy. The German official news agency acknowledged that the Red Army had begun a counter-offensive, advancing with infantry covered by tanks, but the agency was severely hampered and suffered severe losses. The agency stated that there were troops from Siberia in the Soviet army. The British Air Force attacked Crignes and Bitsen, where the German army used it for operations against Murmansk. News from the Swedish capital said that there was no progress in the German and Soviet operations against Murmansk.

### Rumors that a Large Number of German Chemical Weapons Have Been Transported to the Front for Use

International News Service, Stanport - It was believed here yesterday that there were growing signs of a gas war on the German-Soviet battlefield. It has been reported that a large number of chemical weapons have been transported from Germany to the Eastern Front. At the same time, there are rumors that the Red Army also intends to use poison gas. The propaganda agencies of the two countries mutually accuse each other of preparing to implement new terrors, but each denies any intention to use poison gas. According to the Soviet Union, it recently claimed to have seized detailed instructions from German prisoners preparing to use poison gas. Germany then issued a denial, saying that the instructions had been a daily carry-on item for German officers since the outbreak of the war.

### Hopkins and British Envoy Discuss Cooperation to Aid Soviet Union; Hopkins Visits Molotov and Stalin; U.S. Supplies Soviet Union with 10,000 Barrels of Oil

London, Reuters, Day 1 - Washington and Moscow discussed U.S. aid to the Soviet Union yesterday. According to Reuters' Moscow correspondent last night, Roosevelt's special envoy Hopkins met with Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov yesterday afternoon, and then met with Stalin again last night. The British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, hosted a banquet for Hopkins yesterday, and U.S. Ambassador Steinhardt also attended. The Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Umansky, the head of the Soviet purchasing mission, General Golikov, and his assistant, Colonel Lebedev, also visited President Roosevelt at the White House yesterday to discuss U.S. aid to the Soviet Union.

Washington, United Press, Day 1 - Soviet affairs experts yesterday declared that the U.S. military aid liaison Hopkins' flight to Moscow on a long-range bomber is extremely important for future cooperation between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. This trip proves that bombers can fly directly from Britain to Moscow. These experts said that if the bomber Hopkins was on can complete this flight alone, then dozens of bombers can also fly to strengthen the Soviet Union's air defenses. It is suggested that if a considerable number of such aircraft are placed in the hands of the Soviet Union and flown by British pilots from the Soviet side, Germany will be attacked from both sides by air.

Moscow, United Press, Day 1 - Soviet newspapers yesterday devoted most of their space to reporting on the arrival of U.S. aid liaison Hopkins, and published photos of his meeting with Stalin and President Roosevelt's statement guaranteeing prompt aid to the Soviet Union. Hopkins experienced his first night air raid in Moscow on Wednesday, watching anti-aircraft guns and searchlights engage the enemy from the roof of the U.S. Embassy. He spent most of his time in the embassy's bomb shelter, but went to bed as soon as the all-clear siren sounded. Yesterday morning, he toured Moscow accompanied by U.S. Ambassador Steinhardt and expressed surprise at the minor damage caused by the German air force. He was scheduled to have lunch with British Ambassador Cripps yesterday and meet with Stalin and Molotov in the afternoon.

Washington, United Press, Day 1 - Petroleum Coordinator Ickes yesterday proposed that the Production Board give priority to the manufacture of 10,000 steel barrels for the transportation of aviation gasoline and other oils to the Soviet Union. The official Soviet agency (i.e., Amtorg) has obtained an export license from the State Department covering a substantial quantity of such products and will use tankers on the Pacific coast if necessary. London, United Press, Day 1 - Foreign Secretary Eden met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday, followed by a meeting with U.S. Ambassador Winant to discuss the Soviet situation and aid to the Soviet Union.

### Former German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Reportedly Arrested

Istanbul, TASS, Day 1 - According to local press reports, former German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, has been arrested by the German secret police after arriving in Ankara. It is said that Schulenburg expressed his opinions before the German attack on the Soviet Union, urging the German authorities to pay attention to the strength of the Soviet Red Army. This opinion apparently contributed to Schulenburg's arrest.

### Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Announces Expansion of Democratic Front; Soviet-Polish Alliance to Fight Germany; Overthrow Common Enemy and Restore Independence

Moscow, TASS, Day 1 - Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar and Deputy Director of the Information Bureau, Lozovsky, stated at a meeting with foreign journalists yesterday, "Two major events occurred yesterday, which are obviously unfavorable to Hitler, but extremely beneficial to nations yearning for freedom. U.S. President's Special Envoy Hopkins has arrived in Moscow, and on the same day, the agreement to restore diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland was signed in London. These events have a common importance, reflecting the further consolidation and expansion of the democratic countries' anti-Hitler united front. Hopkins has already stated the motives for his visit to the Soviet Union, which need no further explanation. Hopkins' visit to the Soviet Union has once again demonstrated the United States' determination to aid all nations in maintaining, establishing, and resisting Hitler. As for the Soviet-Polish agreement, it also shows that the Slavic nations have declared themselves united to fight against Hitlerism, which aims to destroy the Slavic nations." Lozovsky then informed the reporters of the detailed situation of Poland being brutally oppressed by the German authorities, saying that the Soviet Union would never sit idly by while the fate of the Polish people was threatened, because the Soviet Union and Poland had fought together against Imperial Russia for a long time, and their relationship was extremely close. The common enemy of the Soviet Union and Poland is Hitler, and the common task of Russia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and all freedom-loving nations in the world is to overthrow this common enemy. The Soviet-Polish agreement stipulates the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries and the establishment of Polish troops on Soviet territory. All of this shows that the Soviet Union and Poland have decided to fight together against barbaric Hitlerism and strive for victory. As far as this agreement is concerned, the Soviet Union has declared to the world its support for the creation of a free and independent Poland, and its willingness to use force to liberate Poland from the shackles of fascist rulers. The undoubtedly free and independent Polish people and Poles scattered in various countries will support the Soviet-Polish agreement, and believe that the agreement will surely enable Poland to gain freedom and independence.

Pravda on the Soviet-Polish Agreement

Moscow, TASS, Day 1 - Pravda published a commentary today titled "The United Front of Freedom-Loving Nations," stating, "The Soviet-Polish agreement on the restoration of relations and opposition to Germany has historical significance and marks a new stage in the development of Soviet-Polish relations. Although Poland has been materially devastated, the Polish people love freedom and fight bravely for it. The conclusion of the Soviet-Polish agreement has given the Polish people an opportunity to rebuild their national independence. With the help of the great Soviet nation, the Polish people will surely recover from the wounds inflicted on them by the German aggressors, shake off the shackles imposed on them by Hitler, and embark on the path of national revival. The Soviet Union and Poland have previously signed agreements with Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet-Yugoslav-Czechoslovak alliance has now been joined by Poland. In short, the establishment of the Soviet-Polish agreement has proven the increasing consolidation and expansion of the anti-German alliance. The agreement has great political significance and has established a solid foundation for Soviet-Polish cooperation to fight together against Hitler, the common enemy of all mankind, and strive for victory. After the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia formed an agreement, guerrilla warfare behind the German fascist lines will inevitably intensify. This war will not stop until the enemy Hitler is annihilated."

U.S. Extremely Pleased with Soviet-Polish Agreement

Washington, Havas, July 31 - After the Soviet Union and Poland reached an agreement, U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles expressed satisfaction at a reception for reporters and stated that the United States has never recognized the act of dividing Polish territory by force. The Soviet government's policy is the same as that of the United States, which is welcome to us.

### Germany Uses 300,000 Tons of Gasoline Daily

London, United Press, Day 1 - The authoritative magazine "Petroleum Times" estimated yesterday that Germany uses 300,000 tons of gasoline daily in its war against the Soviet Union. This statistic is based on the German mobilization of 15 armored divisions, 20 mechanized divisions, and 150 army divisions. The magazine also stated that the German army uses 6,300 tanks, 72,500 motorcycles, 3,750 motorized motorcycles, and 4,000 aircraft.

### German Attack on Moscow Blocked; May Be Forced to Attack Turkey; Prediction that This Plan Will Begin in August

London, United Press, Day 1 - The Soviet Union continues to counterattack in the Smolensk region, blocking the German army's path to Moscow, causing British military observers here to believe today that the German army may soon proceed with another plan, namely attacking Ukraine and Turkey simultaneously. Soviet forces in the northern and central regions have apparently been continuously reinforced, so observers declared that the German attempt to open a path to Moscow, even if the German army launches a third blitzkrieg, seems unlikely to succeed. The next step for the German army seems to be to cross the Dniester River and launch a large-scale offensive against Ukraine, with Kharkov, 375 miles to the east, as its ultimate goal. It is generally believed that the German army will simultaneously attack Turkey, so that the Italian army will also have the opportunity to join in cooperation from the Dodecanese Islands and the nearby islands. Military experts pointed out that the German army is concentrated on the Turkish-Bulgarian border, continuing to threaten Turkey, and after the start of the war to attack Ukraine and Turkey at the same time, the final goal of the German army is to reach the Caucasus oil fields, 1,000 miles away. Observers would not be surprised if this offensive begins in August. At the same time, observers pointed out that the German army has not given up hope of obtaining favorable results in the Smolensk region. They may even want to separate the Soviet forces and then attack Voronezh on the Don River, 300 miles south of Moscow. The German army may want to enter southern Ukraine from Voronezh via Kharkov, hoping to make contact with the German-Romanian forces advancing eastward from Bessarabia.

### Iran Denies Existence of Fifth Column

Tehran, Reuters, Day 1 - After rumors that Nazi agents were active in Iran, the Iranian government yesterday assured that it had taken all necessary steps to maintain peace and order. Officials criticized alarmists for spreading rumors, saying that the rumor-mongers seemed unaware of the situation in Iran. The law is strictly enforced in Iran for all people without discrimination. Furthermore, since the international situation became serious, the government has been determined to defend the country and has doubled its vigilance. No one can violate the regulations. The actions, commercial activities, and lives of all foreigners are well known to the government, so they cannot go beyond the bounds of the law and engage in prohibited activities. The government knows the number and names of foreigners, so it can be said that the number of foreigners in Iran is exaggerated.

### Large-Scale Changes in Vichy Diplomatic Personnel

Vichy, Havas, July 31 - The government today changed the personnel of 41 diplomatic missions abroad, the first major adjustment since the Franco-German armistice. It is said that the intention is to send diplomatic personnel of the current government overseas to promote the new French political situation, and at the same time to return diplomatic personnel who have been stationed overseas for more than a year to the country to have more contact with the current government. There will be no changes in French foreign policy as a result.

Vichy, Havas, July 31 - The government has appointed Bauséjour as Acting Consul in Tehran and Couve de Murville as Counselor at the Legation in Iran.

### Egyptian Cabinet Reshuffle Completed

London, Reuters, Day 1 - After the Egyptian cabinet suddenly resigned last night, Prime Minister Sherif was ordered to reorganize the cabinet on a broader basis. It is now announced here that the new cabinet has been formed, with Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sherif, Foreign Minister Sahiim, and Finance Minister Badawi. The new cabinet members include five members each from the Liberal Party, the Independent Party, and the Sa'adist Party, so the government has the support of a majority in parliament, and the internal dispute between the cabinet and the Sa'adist Party has also come to an end.

### Britain and the United States Strictly Implement Economic Controls on Axis Powers; Employ All Techniques of Economic Warfare; Prevent Access to Raw Materials in South America

London, Reuters, Day 1 - An official from the Ministry of Economic Warfare yesterday expressed doubt about the freezing of Japanese assets on both sides of the Atlantic, saying that the freezing of Japanese assets can be fully effective, and make Japan's trade with the countries that implement the freezing policy completely stop. However, the extent to which this mechanism is used is a matter of policy beyond the scope of the Ministry of Economic Warfare. The doubts expressed in American broadcasts seem to come from one source. In fact, the various economic controls implemented by the U.S. government in the past six months have exhausted all the techniques of economic warfare. All goods that are of significant importance to economic warfare are now subject to control and require special licenses to be shipped out. This control method has been extended to the Philippine Islands, and its strength is further enhanced. The control method is very effective. Soon, the entire United States will implement an export system parallel to that of Britain, so that the enemy will not be able to obtain many materials produced in the United States. The countries of Latin America, including Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Chile, have followed Washington's example and established export controls, and the United States is currently conducting a large-scale procurement program, and when the agreement is completed, it will prevent the Axis powers from obtaining the entire mineral production and other important materials in South America. The U.S. President's Black List, which lists 1,800 merchants in Latin America as Germans or Italians who cannot obtain U.S. export licenses, is very valuable and can make the British Black List more effective. It not only assists in the blockade of financial and important goods, but also in the control of the U.S. The U.S.'s requisition of enemy ships in the U.S. has eliminated the danger of enemy ships taking the opportunity to break through the blockade, and the control of the Pacific route by the U.S. Maritime Commission has also greatly reduced the tonnage that can carry dangerous goods across the Pacific.

### U.S. Industrial Groups Assist China in Production

New York, United Press, Day 1 - The United China Relief yesterday stated that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the engineering department of the University of New Hampshire have agreed to assist 3,000 small industrial groups in researching technological problems. These small industrial groups are all working in the interior of China, employing more than 100,000 Chinese people in busy work, and assisting refugees and the Chinese army in producing various useful goods for industrial affairs.

Moscow, International News Service, Day 1 - U.S. Special Envoy Hopkins met with Stalin and Molotov again yesterday. He reaffirmed to the Soviet government that the United States would provide substantial assistance immediately.

### U.S. Appoints Minister to Iceland

Washington, Reuters, Day 1 - Former U.S. Minister to Greece, MacVeagh, has been appointed by President Roosevelt as Minister to Iceland.

### Japanese Conspiracy to Sabotage U.S. West Coast Exposed; Japanese Naval Officers Cooperating with Fishing Boats; U.S. Investigation Committee Obtains Sufficient Evidence

Washington, United Press, Day 1 - Texas Democratic Congressman Dies yesterday stated that, according to the findings of his "House Un-American Activities Committee," sufficient evidence has been obtained to prove that Japan is engaged in a conspiracy to sabotage the U.S. West Coast. Dies said that former Japanese consulate officials revealed that Japanese naval officers are cooperating with Japanese fishermen on Terminal Island near Los Angeles. These fishing boats can be converted into torpedo boats at any time.

— By Yi

(Hong Kong Special Correspondent) Hong Kong, isolated south of the Nanling Mountains, has now become a weather station in the Pacific winds and clouds, and its residents are a gathering of people from all over the world. All its dynamics are watched by all parties. I will now record the recent situation in Hong Kong in fragments. "Though far apart, souls are near." I think the compatriots in Shanghai may need these seemingly ordinary tidbits!

Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote will return to the country in early September, and the new Governor Sir Mark Young will arrive before Sir Geoffrey Northcote departs. Overseas Chinese gentlemen in Hong Kong, such as Ho Tung, have launched a campaign to present a farewell ode and souvenirs to Sir Geoffrey Northcote.

When British banking magnate Sir Victor Sassoon passed through Hong Kong from the United States, he wrote to the South China Morning Post that he had already donated to the Central China War Fund, but in order to encourage Hong Kong braves to donate, if 100,000 pounds (equivalent to HK$1.6 million at that time) can be raised by October 31, he is also willing to donate 100,000 pounds.

Ji Chaoding, an economic expert who previously went to the United States with Chen Guangfu, returned to Hong Kong from the United States by flying clipper on the 15th. Fox, Sidney Mason, and others welcomed him at the airport. Mr. Ji assisted Chen Guangfu in the United States to promote Sino-American trade and made many contributions.

Hong Kong - Guangdong Province Inland Aviation, only China National Aviation Corporation's Hong Kong-Shaoguan line, recently stopped operating. Eurasia Aviation Corporation will add Hong Kong-Shaoguan flights, and is also preparing to open the Hong Kong-Meizhou air route and is surveying the airport.

Hong Kong's air defense exercises are being actively held. From July 21 to 24, a blackout will be implemented, and maritime traffic will also be suspended. A large-scale air defense exercise for the entire Hong Kong will be held in the near future.

Mr. Yang Yunshi of Jiangdong passed away in Hong Kong last month after suffering from hemiplegia for three years. Fortunately, his friends Xu Shiying, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaoji, Yang Qianli, Qin Daishi, Huang Dingyi, and Xu Muxing presided over his funeral. Yang Qianli also wrote an elegy to mourn him, with lines such as "Ten thousand miles of rivers and mountains are just a dream, three years of skin and bones are left with poetry."

Radio Hong Kong is holding Hong Kong-Macau wireless telephone conversations, so that British expatriates in Hong Kong can have intimate conversations with their wives evacuated to Australia, to relieve the pain of separation. The time has been set for the evening of July 31, with a limit of 25 participants and 50 sentences per conversation. It is also a wartime story.

### Metals; Metals Prohibited from Export

Although metal products are prohibited from export by the Jianghai Customs, the minds of the industry have not been discouraged by this. In addition, overseas sources have been cut off, and street sales and factory demand are still not weak. Stockholders use their vision to buy and sell from time to time, which is also the only reason for raising the prices of various goods. The market atmosphere is affected by the unpredictable financial changes, so there are also many changes. However, the big rises and falls are nothing more than the result of speculation by hoarders. According to market statistics, there are generally more rises than falls. The details are as follows.

Union Steel: Union steel is divided into old steel mills and new steel mills, but the market is now shouting for 700 yuan. The reason is that the actual price is too high. The difference between the two goods is about 10 yuan, which is not enough to affect it. This big market price of 700 yuan, so holders only shout one kind of price, and those who inquire also ask with one kind of price. The current market for the two goods has a trend to merge into one, and can factories etc. do not dare to purchase a large quantity of such expensive goods, so actual sales are not smooth, but inventories are also unusually thin. The market price is rising, affected by this.

Tinplate: It is the authentic product of Union Steel, with a fixed length and width and uniform thickness. It is the only box-making raw material for egg factories, and the daily transaction is even rarer than Union Steel, because its market price is more expensive than Union Steel. There is a fear that British and Italian goods may be cut off, so the market buys and sells with American goods as the inquiry, so the price is quoted with American goods. Yesterday, 180 pounds per box sold for 760 yuan, 200 pounds per box sold for 800 yuan, small tinplate 90 pounds opened for 380 yuan, 100 pounds per box shouted for 400 yuan, but the circulation of goods is also not numerous, and the market price is higher than the previous market, all up without falling.

Original Iron Nails: This factory has been in the market for a long time. Since the sharp rise to 205 yuan, affected by the customs' prohibition of exports, it has returned to 185 yuan. Up to yesterday, it is still shouting to sell at this price, and the transaction is not lively, so the market atmosphere is difficult to develop. Stockholders have absorbed a lot when the price was high, such as those who bought at 200 yuan or 191 yuan. There are many people. When the market price suddenly fell the next day, the purchasers were dumbfounded, wanting to profit but instead losing money. Such situations are countless, and the reason why the current market trend of iron nails is difficult to improve for a while is that there are no actual transactions, only empty hoarding, eating and water disappearing, accumulating but not transforming, and the market circulation of goods is very numerous, and the market price may soften again in the future.

New Wire Nails: The market momentum of new wire nails, although not as good as tinplate and Union Steel, is more than the original iron nails. The original nail market price has fallen by more than 20 yuan, but the new wire nails have only dropped by 15 yuan. Yesterday the market shouted a price of 250 yuan per dan, but the actual transaction was not much, because the nail factories in this street have closed 60-70%, and the absorption of raw materials is very scarce. What is purchased is only scattered transactions from screw factories, lead wire factories, and the building industry on this street.

### Finance; Foreign Exchange Speculation Scope Reduced; Very Large Number of Long Positions in Actual Goods

The foreign exchange market yesterday, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced at 9:30 a.m. that the British exchange rate was reduced by 0.0625, totaling three pounds 0.0625, the Hong Kong dollar was reduced by half a yuan, and the Indian dollar and Singapore dollar were both reduced by 0.25. The US dollar, Lüshun dollar, and Dutch guilder did not change, and there was no market for the French franc, German mark, and Japanese yen. The British exchange rate in the black market continued to be tight, while the US dollar tightened first and then returned to level. The HSBC small counter US dollar was reduced by another 0.0625, totaling 5.125 yuan. Importers were scrambling to settle, so it was also tight to 5.125 yuan, and the British pound was 3 pounds 0.09375. Later, the US dollar was supplied and sold through China Bank, and it rebounded. In the afternoon, foreign banks did each other's business at 5.21875 yuan, and speculators remained on the sidelines. As of last night, speculators' short positions were minimal, and a group of asset holders had a very large number of long positions in actual goods.

HSBC Announces Reduction of British Gold

Since the morning, foreign telegrams reported that the British, American, and Indian silver markets were level, and the exchange rate of the US dollar against Shanghai rose by eight points, while the rest were level. The early opening selling price of the domestic market banks, spot British pound was 3 pounds 0.09375, and the US dollar was 5.1875 yuan, which was tighter by 0.03125 than the previous British rate, and the US dollar was level. After opening, Chinese businessmen waited and watched. Because the bank had less supply than demand, HSBC announced a reduction in the British rate and a level US dollar. After the silver balancing tax was still levied at 24.50%, the HSBC small counter US dollar was reduced by another 0.0625, totaling 5.125 yuan, so it also softened to only settle at 5.125 yuan. Soon, China Bank spat out the August rate of 5.1875 yuan, which was absorbed by a certain foreign bank, and the momentum rebounded. The noon closing British gold was still 3 pounds 0.09375, and the US dollar at 5.1875 yuan could be settled again.

Banks Do August Futures with Each Other

In the afternoon, only two foreign banks were heard doing each other's August US dollar futures at 5.21875 yuan, and speculators still had little supply and demand. The market was stable. At the 3:30 p.m. closing, both spot and August futures were 3 pounds 0.09375 for the British pound, and 5.1875 yuan for the US dollar, which was tighter by 0.03125 for the British pound and level for the US dollar compared with the closing price of the previous day.

### The Rise of Cash is Even Sharper

Yesterday, in the heated, yet opaque, cash market, prices initially rose and then unexpectedly returned to even. This was because the American banks in the city were not as strict as the British banks in freezing Sino-Japanese funds. Therefore, the American exchange rate of $5.1875 was still supplied as usual. With the market shifting from tight to even, securities firms and retail investors entered, pushing the price up to $6,750. However, not long after, the large exchange merchant Dafeng heavily sold, causing a decline. In the afternoon, under selling pressure from retail investors, the price fell back to $6,710. It was then absorbed and held up by securities firms, ultimately seeing a rise of one yuan. The total daily transaction volume was over 20,000 taels. Public sentiment is gradually stabilizing, and the rise in cash is becoming even sharper. Wanfeng Jewelry Store released 30 taels of silver at a price of $8,250. Another jewelry store, Yuxiangxing, also released 20 taels to Defu at a price of $8,230. Yuxiangxing Yongyoulai repeatedly bought, with Tianyuan releasing 30 taels at $8,180, and Hesheng releasing 20 taels at $8,320. In the afternoon, gold shops released 60 taels, and jewelry stores released 20 taels at $8,350, which was still bought by Yuxiangxing Yong, causing the price to rise by another 200 yuan. Gold jewelry also rose by 15 yuan, reaching $855.

Futures Prices Have Already Been Driven Up

Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 9:15 AM, immediately rising by 17 yuan to $6,730, due to reports of tight foreign exchange. The price continued to be driven up to $6,740. Dafeng Exchange Company came to cash out its drafts, and Yida also sold, leading to a drop of 30 yuan, falling to $6,712. Upon hearing that the HSBC small counter had further reduced the US dollar exchange rate to $5.125, Xinfeng, Defu, and Rencheng Yong also absorbed the supply, immediately causing a rise of 38 yuan, reaching $6,750. However, Dafeng continued to sell, and Meifeng and securities companies also sold, gradually suppressing the price to $6,715. At noon, the price was lifted again, closing the morning at $6,722. The market opened at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, still at $6,722. Qingtai Yong, along with retail investors, sold small amounts down to $6,710. Defu and Yuxiangxing Yong bought in, lifting the price by 20 yuan, rising to $6,730. Xinyuan and Decheng slightly released, causing another drop, closing at $6,714, a sharp increase of one yuan compared to the previous day. Based on the August US dollar rate of $5.1875, the continued price was $6,713.25, meaning it has already been driven up by 7.5 jiao. After closing, the price was very close to $6,712-6,713, with a difference of 40 yuan throughout the day. The gold shops' own-brand gold was sold at $8,400, and the buy-back price was reduced by 200 yuan. Currently, there is a lack of bids and no market for margin gold.

Jewelry Gold Rises for Three Consecutive Sessions

The exchange price for gold jewelry in jewelry stores. Datongxing and Xintongxing both raised the price by five yuan at 9:30 AM, then raised it by another five yuan at 12:00 PM, and again raised it by five yuan at 2:15 PM in the afternoon, reaching $855, a cumulative increase of fifteen yuan. The buy-back price was reduced by 40 yuan, it is said.

### Foreign Currencies All Rise

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot cash continuing to rise strongly. British and American gold pounds also continued to rise by two yuan, with the latter reaching the $200 mark. US dollar drafts opened at $1,928, and after opening, Rentai Yong sold, retreating to $25. Tongxing, Dongsheng, Hengda, and Gong bought, lifting the price to $36. Yintai sold, again retreating to $28, closing the morning at $30.

Spot cash, on the other hand, rose to $19.1 jiao. Hong Kong drafts showed a firm trend, with market prices rising steadily. Japanese gold drafts continued to rise by one fen, rising to $2.08 in the evening market. Korean drafts showed a stable trend, remaining at the original level of $1.72 in the evening market.

### Securities: Public Bonds Are Exhausted and Cannot Rise

The over-the-counter market for public bonds yesterday gradually showed signs of exhaustion and inability to rise. Because after the dividend payment, it is no longer easy to stimulate interest in buying. Trading suddenly saw a clear reduction, and market prices fell. Type A bonds are about to be drawn for redemption, and Type B bonds are also approaching their turn to be drawn, so there is quite a bit of buying of Type A and B bonds and selling of Type C and E bonds. Yesterday morning, Lianhe and Yuxing slightly bought, while Tongshun sold voluminously. Tongkang, Runde, and Zhenkang also sold Type C bonds, breaking through six yuan. In the afternoon, Tongshun bought back, Dafeng covered short positions, and Jiufeng and Lianxing bought in. Zhongfu Bank sold, and Lianhe, Tongxing, and Yiji all released. Type C bonds again reached above six yuan. In the end, except for Type B, which was still good at three and a half jiao, the rest were slightly lower by about two jiao. The trading volume was only about 1.1 to 1.2 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock trading involved the transaction of 40 shares of Yiyou Industrial Company stock, with a price of $12.50.

The stock market was slightly quieter, and prices changed very little. Xiangtai Timber Company stock rose again to a new high price of $85, while the rest remained flat. Rubber stocks showed an unsteady trend.

London, 31st (Thursday) telegram: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign bonds and frozen British companies' stocks returned to calm. Only HSBC Bank's London-registered shares uniquely rebounded by one pound, with a price of £70. The rest remained unchanged. (Also, yesterday's code for Crisp public bonds was mistakenly reported as £39; it should have been £30. This correction is hereby made.)

### Cotton Yarn: Export Concerns Not Yet Resolved; Yarn Market Still Dominated by Short Selling

The yarn market has entered a fluctuating state, but the Hong Kong merchants' procurement is still considered not weak. They continued to buy 600 pieces of Double Horse 20-count yarn at $1,560, and there were more than 100 bales of 32-count single yarn and 200 bales of coarse and fine yarns, totaling 965 bales. Thus, public sentiment stabilized. However, there is a partial concern that although the yarn purchased by Guangdong merchants has been cleared by customs and loaded onto ships, it has not yet been officially exported. If it safely sails out of the Wusongkou, there will be no problem, and the yarn market will have a good period. Currently, the doubts have not been completely resolved, so while market prices go up, short selling is still active, and the force of advancement is again obstructed. As for the large traders, they have both short and long positions, so the market is tired but upward-trending. The market price for Double Horse 20-count yarn is $1,579, and the low price is $1,547, with a difference of only 32 yuan. In the early afternoon, the initial price was $1,548, rising to $1,560, and the closing price was $1,555. Today, 60 bales of cotton yarn were test-loaded for Yantai.

The opening of Double Horse was calm in sentiment. The opening was still tired, at $1,550. Because everyone was calling for lower prices, the price suddenly rose to $1,570. However, with the price slightly higher, those who profited released their positions, and the market situation became flat. At the same time, Guangdong merchants did not make large purchases, and the price fluctuated between $55 and $56 for a long time. Unexpectedly, gold prices improved, and the yarn market followed suit, reaching $1,579. Subsequently, some negative rumors were released, and the price fell back to $1,548. The closing price was slightly higher, at $1,552. The total transaction volume for half a day was statistically 7,005 bales. The amount purchased by each group is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 965; Southeast Asia 40;
Counterparts 6,000; Total 7,005.

The market conditions for Double Horse futures yarn. The market opened early in the morning because Hong Kong merchants vigorously purchased spot yarn the previous day, and gold shops and securities firms bought in the near term. August rose by 12 yuan, with the price at $1,460. September was unchanged. October suddenly fell by 4 yuan due to long position liquidations, with the price at $1,520. After opening, speculative merchants still had a large appetite for buying. August stabilized. September rose to $1,520, and October rose to $1,522. After entering, the trend of falling US and Indian cotton was still intense, and there were no special developments in foreign exchange and gold prices. Spot sales in Hong Kong were relatively weaker, and long positions were re-selling. August fell to $1,437, September fell to $1,507, and October fell to $1,513, gradually recovering slightly. The noon closing saw August down 3 yuan, September down 2 yuan, and October down 8 yuan. The trading volume was 7,200 bales. The near market was weak, and the distant market was firm, with a difference of 1.5 to 3 yuan up and down. The evening closing results showed August down 4.5 yuan from the previous day, September down 5 yuan, and October down 6.5 yuan. The total daily trading volume was 10,500 bales, a decrease of 14,660 bales from the previous day. The full-day opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded below (net market quotes).

### Cotton Market Quiet and Unremarkable

The current cotton situation is sluggish and lacks good characteristics. US cotton continues to decline, and the yarn market is also mediocre. Factories have very little activity. However, there are slight interspersed transactions between counterparts. The cotton market situation is also in a resting state.

### Grains: Imported Rice Continues to Arrive; Rice Prices Rise Slightly

The source of imported rice is very strong, continuously arriving in Shanghai, as repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan wheel arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 30th) evening, transporting 11,000 bags of imported rice for the Municipal Council's price stabilization program from Hong Kong. It was moored at the floating dock during import and is scheduled to move to the company's dock on the Bund of the French Concession today for unloading. In addition, the Philippine wheel S.S. Florenee D., managed by Wah Lun Yanghang, transported 30,000 bags of imported rice from Rangoon and arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday, docking at the Huashun dock in Hongkou for unloading. Today, there are 1,000 bags of corn loaded on the Taikoo Shuntian wheel, bound for Weihaiwei. (Zu)

Yesterday, imported rice arrived continuously in port and has not yet been unloaded into warehouses. Subsequent batches will continue to arrive. There are also more than 670 bags of new Wuhu Xian rice arriving in Shanghai. Public inspections of imported rice in various warehouses also show a substantial 1,245,701 bags. However, the actual consumption for digestion is very small. The majority of transactions are still round-trip deals in the market. Therefore, the early market situation was weak, and the market presented a tired trend. The slight drop in prices then led to the activity of customer囤, especially for traders from Shantou, Shanghai West, and other external factions, coupled with numerous rumors, and the market sentiment increased. All rice rebounded from its fatigue and prices rose, with futures and spot prices rising in unison. The small exchange market once again reached 122.5 yuan per stone, while spot prices at Yinghua Company ranged from 148 yuan to 150 yuan. Two-Number Siamese rice also reached 140 yuan and 8 jiao, initially only 139 yuan. One-Number Saigon also opened at 149.5 yuan. In total, more than 700 tons were transacted. Once spot goods became active by customer囤, opening prices saw a total of 13,000 to 14,000 bags, with prices all rising by one to two yuan, it is said.

Thick and Thin: The source is becoming scarce. Fresh early and late varieties of Southern Hong Kong are sold in the market, which, after a previous period of depreciation, has yesterday attracted local shops to take advantage of the cheap prices, causing the rice to tighten. Selling prices have risen by one to two yuan accordingly, opening at 154 or 155 yuan to 151 or 152 yuan. Wuxi original-package white japonica rice is continuing its fine showing due to the scarcity of goods and aromatic flavor, opening at 146 yuan to 143.5 yuan. Glutinous rice remains in a cold state, with scarce goods and sluggish sales, continuing to lack changes, still opening at 126 yuan to 123 yuan for Hong Kong white glutinous rice, 116 yuan to 113 yuan for glutinous green, and 127 or 128 yuan for national glutinous rice.

### Miscellaneous Grains: After Futures Halt, Spot Oil Drops Back by Ten Yuan

After many days of high prices, the oil market yesterday, due to the suspension of futures trading, saw speculators disappearing, the situation becoming much more peaceful, and gradual selling. Actual sales are not that high, so the market gradually shifted towards a price drop. As a result, prices generally fell by five to ten yuan compared to the previous day. The general market saw 80 barrels of Dalian soybean oil sold, with prices ranging from 260 yuan to 250 yuan, 15 barrels of Qingdao raw oil sold for 260 yuan, and 500 dan of Dayou Factory clear oil sold for 170 yuan to 160 yuan. Corn's actual sales continue to show good form. Japanese merchant interest remains strong. Yesterday, nearly 10,000 bags of Saigon and Dutch corn were sold, and prices again rose by about two yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Futures Resume Trading; Sugar Prices All Rise

Yesterday, according to a telegram from the Dutch East Indies, cargo of coarse sand scheduled to be shipped in July and August had not yet been shipped due to international circumstances and has been temporarily suspended. If so, the subsequent source may have problems. All Sugar Joint Venture Companies that specialize in futures trading (location: Zhejiang Hotel building on Foreign Firm Street) opened for business yesterday, with a total transaction volume of over 20,000 bags. August 14th futures opened at 105 yuan, reached a high of 06 yuan 3 jiao, and closed at a low of 05 yuan 6 jiao. August 20th futures opened at 107 yuan, reached a high of 7 yuan 5 jiao, a low of 6 yuan 6 jiao, and closed at 106 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen.

Dutch red KD mark 87 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. Taikoo car white B mark 132 yuan, an increase of 3.5 yuan. HX mark 107 yuan 3.5 jiao to 8 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan. Also, 2,500 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### North and South Goods: Golden Vegetables Rebound

Golden vegetables were initially hindered due to the Hong Kong shipping ban, and quotations for a small number of bags fell by one to two jiao. As it has now been lifted, it can still be transported to Hong Kong for sale, and prices have returned to their original state. New vegetables, due to the aforementioned reason, have recently lacked further sourcing, and inventories are very thin, so caution should be exercised to prevent further tightening.

### Seafood: Sea Cucumber Rises Sharply by One Hundred Yuan

Western sea cucumber prices have recently tightened due to foreign exchange factors. Yesterday, a batch of Aden bald sea cucumber was opened, and prices for each type rose by as much as one hundred yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Fennel Shortage Rebounds

Due to the gradual decline in market prices, all traders had to bear losses, so few new orders were placed for fennel. As a result, spot goods gradually felt a shortage. An investigation showed that the maximum decline was over 50 yuan, and it has now rebounded by 20 points, showing a rather tight trend.

### British Funds Needed for Legal Trade; British Government Will Have Regulations; Expected London Reply by Monday; Market Conditions Have Been Calm for Days with No Speculation

The United States and Britain have successively announced the freezing of funds from China and Japan. The official decree from the United States arrived in Shanghai on the 29th, stipulating that for legal and legitimate trade between any part of China and the United States, South America, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands, fourteen banks are authorized to supply foreign exchange, only restricting its transfer to countries and people outside of China. It has a considerable degree of flexibility and has a very shallow impact on Shanghai. The British directive arrived in Shanghai on the 31st, and the stipulated methods are stricter than those of the United States. All British banks in China should freeze all pound sterling deposits, bonds, and cash, prohibiting payment even for the minimum cost of living and other legitimate uses. Although it is stated that import and export trade with China and the sterling area will still be supported, no methods have been specified. Therefore, all banks have telegraphed London to request instructions. According to reliable news obtained by reporters, the reply telegram from London is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai next Monday (the 4th). In addition to providing instructions on how to support China's foreign trade, it is said that it will allow the payment of the minimum cost of living from the frozen funds of residents in China. As for the statement in the document that "certain exchange transactions may continue to be carried out," it refers to Thai Baht exchange.

Market Reaction is Exceptionally Good

Since the British government's freezing order was implemented in Shanghai, the financial market has responded very well yesterday. However, because this implementation order freezes all British and non-British funds for all British citizens, making it impossible to withdraw even the minimum cost of living and legitimate uses, creating great difficulties, British citizens are greatly hoping that British commercial banks will routinely communicate to London to revise this content. According to senior officials at HSBC, the return telegram has not yet been received and is not expected to arrive in Shanghai before next Monday. Senior officials at McGillvary Bank said that it is expected to arrive in Shanghai on Monday. Currently, British commercial banks, according to this decree, although they may not support import and export trade between China and Japan and outside the sterling area, are still striving to balance long and short exchange transactions. After this implementation order was reported in the morning yesterday, market brokers were very alarmed, but the market situation was very stable. Stock market fluctuations were minimal, and the international exchange rate for British pounds and US dollars was between 4.01 yuan and 4.03 yuan, close to the statutory price.

Measures Taken by British and American Banks

Since the implementation of the freezing order arrived in Shanghai, the measures taken by British and American banks are: (1) Six British commercial banks, HSBC, McGillvary, Advantage, Sassoon, New Sassoon, and Old Sassoon, etc., have abolished the method of paying London drafts or paying legal tender at the black market exchange rate to Chinese foreign exchange depositors. Regardless of pound sterling deposits, bonds, and cash, they will all be sealed and absolutely not allowed to be withdrawn freely. (2) Five American commercial banks, Citibank, Chase, American Allied, American Express, and Tongjilong, etc., still allow Chinese US dollar deposits to be paid in legal tender according to the black market exchange rate. If importers need foreign exchange due to legitimate orders for American goods, they are allowed to withdraw New York drafts. Therefore, the British approach is stricter than the American approach, and the American freezing method is not thorough.

Exchange Market Speculation Has Almost Disappeared

The English-language American Evening News said that HSBC's opening prices for US and British exchange rates were slightly lower than the previous day's (31st) closing prices, but interbank exchange rates in the morning were the same as yesterday. British banks are mostly prepared to help long or short pound positions find ways to offset, and the demand for exchange from genuine merchants seems to have been satisfied to some extent. Speculative transactions in the exchange market have almost disappeared, and the market situation is very calm, with extremely small fluctuations and not stimulated by new rumors. Business people, at least, no longer express the panic they had in the past few days about exchange rates. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has not yet returned to calm this morning, but securities are quite resistant, with fluctuations only slightly exceeding one pound. The funds of various companies registered in Hong Kong have been frozen, but this has not caused a major commotion among its shareholders. With no drastic changes in the exchange market, the commodity market is also stable. Until noon, market prices for various goods have only slightly risen or fallen compared to yesterday's closing prices.

### Dutch East Indies Allows Chinese to Transit

Because of the implementation of wartime laws, the Dutch East Indies has added restrictions to Chinese transiting through, which has caused great inconvenience for those traveling from Shanghai. It has now been learned that this matter has been resolved through repeated negotiations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the future, Chinese travelers traveling through the Dutch East Indies, if they carry a passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, can freely land. However, they must abide by the residency period specified on the passport or by the local government. It is also known that for Shanghai Chinese who need to travel through the Dutch East Indies, they can first obtain a passport from the Hong Kong office.

### Rumors that Dutch Nationals in Shanghai Will Evacuate Have Been Proven False; Those Who Booked Tickets on the Dutch Ship Were All British and American Nationals; The Chibad Arrives in Shanghai Today and Will Depart for India Next Week

Because the first and second-class cabins on the ship were fully booked a few days ago, rumors circulated that Dutch nationals in Shanghai were preparing to evacuate, as if the situation in the Far East would become more serious. This was investigated and confirmed to be incorrect by the Dutch Consulate in Shanghai.

The Dutch Consulate Officially Denies

Yesterday, the Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai claimed that the report that "Dutch nationals in Shanghai would evacuate and return to their home country on the Java Company's ship Chibad, and the company has stopped selling first and second-class tickets" was completely untrue. The person in charge also said that there were only more than two hundred Dutch nationals in Shanghai, and they were all merchants. Although the situation in the Far East is currently unstable, the government will not order the evacuation of Dutch citizens in Shanghai at this time.

There is Another Reason for Rejecting Ship Tickets

Yesterday, reporters also inquired with the Java Company authorities. It was stated that there was no Dutch national evacuation. As for the passengers who booked first and second-class cabins on the ship, most were British and American nationals, and some of the cabins were booked by passengers from Hong Kong, who will transfer to other ships to return to their home countries after the ship arrives in the Dutch East Indies. The Chibad is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong, Java, Batavia, and other places around next Thursday.

Exports to the Dutch East Indies Have Come to a Standstill

It is also learned that since the Jianghai Customs Office, at the request of the Japanese side, prohibited the export of fifteen categories of goods, the business of Dutch ships has also been greatly affected. Goods such as various enamel porcelain daily necessities and waste cotton, etc., are the main exports from Shanghai to the Dutch East Indies. Because they are now subject to an embargo, this trade has already come to a standstill.

### Shen Bao Readers' Aid-to-Education Movement Extends to Rural Areas; Zhouzhuang Children's Group Donates Funds; Xia Zhenbo Saves Transportation Fare to Contribute

Our newspaper's Readers' Aid-to-Education Fund entered its twentieth day yesterday, and we are deeply grateful for the group donation from colleagues at HSBC Bank. Furthermore, students from the advanced summer class of the Zhouzhuang Zhennan Primary School also collected funds and sent them from afar. In these extraordinary times, with obstructed inland transportation, it is truly gratifying that these individuals are able to read the newspaper daily and develop an interest in aiding education. Recently, Li Xingchu, a graduate of a disaster relief orphanage, also sent a letter stating that his family suffered from war damage and was almost displaced. After graduating from elementary school, he has now been admitted to the junior high school department of Fudan University and requests a subsidy for room and board. After consideration by our colleagues, we can only provide assistance for tuition and fees according to regulations, and other requests cannot be approved.

Yesterday's Donations

The following donations were received for the Aid-to-Education Fund yesterday: HSBC Bank colleagues, 327 yuan; Gong Zhu, 39 yuan; Dai, 37.5 yuan; entire class of advanced summer class students from Zhouzhuang Zhennan Primary School, 31 yuan; Liu, 25 yuan; Yu, 25 yuan; Zhao, 25 yuan; Wang, 25 yuan; Sun Tongbiao, 20 yuan; Xia Zhenbo, 13.09 yuan; Zhan Qihua, 12 yuan; Ms. Wang Ying's second donation, 9 yuan; Gu Huixing, 3 yuan; Feng Peiji, 2 yuan; Little Sister Hu Qiaoyuan, 2 yuan; Xia Guanghua, Shen Shikui, Yan Bingcheng, Huang Buling, Rong Wenbang, Fang Huide, Ni Renfu, 12.5 yuan combined; Song Linhai, Song Yafang, Li Daolin, Li Boquan, Sun Yingdi, Lu Zhenhua, 10 yuan combined. The above totals 618.09 yuan. Previous balance: 16,348.52 yuan. Total: 16,966.61 yuan.

Reaching Deep into the Countryside

The entire class of advanced summer class students from Zhouzhuang Zhennan Primary School wrote, "Dear reporters, although we are in the countryside, we feel as though we see you often. We are very sympathetic and excited that your newspaper has initiated an aid-to-education movement for underprivileged students with aspirations to learn. Although the amount of our donation is very small (31 yuan), we are not ashamed. For those poor children, we should express our enthusiastic assistance. Finally, in the countryside, we will continue to promote this great and meaningful work. We wish you good health and happiness."

Saving on Transportation Fare

Xia Zhenbo wrote, "In these extraordinary times, the cost of living is soaring daily, and the number of young people suffering from the misfortune of being unable to attend school is increasing daily. Upon hearing and seeing this, I sigh at my limited capabilities and can only express my regret. Upon reading about the founding of the 'Readers' Aid-to-Education Fund' by your newspaper, and the enthusiastic donations of large sums of money from all sectors of society, the results are remarkable. Young people who cannot attend school are benefiting from your generosity, which is deeply moving. Due to the sudden increase in transportation fares (trams and buses), I am willing to walk and donate my saved transportation fare for this month, amounting to 13.09 yuan in legal tender, as a small expression of my sincere feelings."

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Reduced to Two Trips; Frequent Japanese Military Transport; Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Withdraw from Various Places, Passing Through Shanghai and Heading to the Northeast Provinces and the Vietnam Area

The Continental Daily News reported, "We have recently learned that the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway has been seized for use by the Japanese military, resulting in the halving of the number of trains between Shanghai and Hangzhou.

The movement of troops along the Jinpu Railway is frequent. Many Japanese soldiers are passing through Shanghai on this route, heading to Vietnam. While Japanese officials are not confirming information regarding troop movements, they are not denying it."

### Zhejiang Eastern Commerce Suffers Severe Damage

Since the outbreak of war in coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, various businesses have suffered. The Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Commerce has submitted temporary relief measures to the authorities for adoption and implementation. The original telegram stated, "The above is omitted. Since the eastern Zhejiang area has been disturbed, and the rear cities have been repeatedly bombed, businesses everywhere have suffered. Our association has repeatedly received reports from county and town chambers of commerce about the situation, which is truly devastating and heartbreaking. In addition to offering comfort and supervising the chambers of commerce in properly planning for the aftermath, we are submitting two temporary relief measures: (1) It is difficult for merchants to recover after this disaster. All taxes and levies should be waived. After full restoration of business, a reassessment should be made based on the actual business situation. Do not impose any undue demands at this time. Maintaining commerce is the way to cultivate tax revenue. (2) After the devastation, the general poor merchants and people are in panic over food, clothing, and shelter. Special compassion should be shown and relief provided to prevent displacement."

### Both Concessions Tightened Security Yesterday; Iron Gates Connecting to Nanshi Were All Closed; Bomb Exploded in Western Shanghai, Injuring More Than Ten People

Yesterday, the British and French Concessions were heavily guarded. The International Settlement merely increased the frequency of patrols, while the French Concession closed all iron gates connecting to Nanshi. On one side, non-essential roads along the border of Avenue Foch and Avenue Edward VII were blocked, leaving only Route Cardinal Mercier, Route Tenant de la Tour, Route de Menteigne, Dongxin Bridge, and Laobeimen Street as entry and exit points for traffic. However, detectives were densely deployed, and inspections were very strict.

Iron Nets Added to Various Places in Western Shanghai

In the Western Shanghai area, such as Yuyuan Road, Great Western Road, and Bubbling Well Road, iron wire nets were added to various intersections, guarded by special police. Yesterday, around 5:00 PM, the iron gates of the French Concession were opened for five minutes before being closed again. They will likely be opened today.

Martial Law Declared in Nanshi Yesterday

It is also known that inspections in Nanshi are extremely strict. Furthermore, because the person in charge of yesterday's Nanshi car parade was shot and killed in front of No. 11 Wanzhu Street in the city around 11:00 PM the night before, and a Japanese chauffeur of the Japanese Military Police was injured by stray bullets, yesterday's parade in Nanshi was also cancelled, and martial law was declared. Residents were not allowed to go out. It was not until noon that passage was permitted. However, the area around Minguo Road is still closed to traffic, cutting off transportation as before.

Bomb Exploded in Zhaofeng Garden

It is also known that around 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, under the shade of a tree next to the Silver Taxi Company across from Zhaofeng Garden in Western Shanghai, a man suddenly held a hand grenade. Just as he was about to throw it to the ground, the hand grenade exploded on the spot. The grenade thrower was unable to escape and was seriously injured. Splinters also injured more than ten men and women, including a woman about thirty years old who died from injuries to vital organs. Afterwards, the Japanese immediately sent a team to conduct a strict search of the area and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, all the special police were dispatched to various roads to guard against further incidents. It is rumored that three or four suspects have been arrested.

Western Newspaper Reports in Detail on Japanese Soldier Shot

The English-language China Press reported that a Japanese military policeman was shot and seriously injured on Minguo Road near the border of the French Concession in Nanshi last night (the 31st). The perpetrator fled immediately. A Chinese chauffeur witnessed the incident and chased after the perpetrator, also being shot and injured. The Japanese authorities in Nanshi are currently investigating the case. It was revealed this morning (the 1st) that the injured Japanese military policeman is named Haijime Sakai, a first-class soldier in the Nanshi Japanese Military Police. At 9:45 PM last night, he was on guard outside the military police office when the perpetrator fired several shots at close range. The Japanese soldier was hit but still held onto the perpetrator. However, due to excessive bleeding, he lost strength, and the perpetrator struggled and escaped. A chauffeur passing by saw the situation and chased after the perpetrator, also being shot and injured. The perpetrator ultimately escaped. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese authorities immediately dispatched troops to search nearby households and pedestrians near the scene. The iron gates connecting Nanshi to the French Concession were also closed. The rumor that the iron gates would be closed for two weeks has been denied by relevant parties.

### Preventing Manipulation and Monopoly; Strictly Prohibiting Officials from Engaging in Business; Authorities Issue Circular to All Provinces to Conduct Regular Inspections; Unscrupulous Merchants Who Hoard and Speculate Will Also Be Severely Punished

During wartime, high commodity prices affect people's livelihoods. The authorities are making every effort to regulate and encourage the production of various daily necessities to meet the need. Also, officials relying on their positions and power to engage in business, manipulate, and monopolize the markets are one of the reasons for abnormal commodity prices. Therefore, at the Second National Political Council, a solemn resolution was made to strictly inspect and punish unscrupulous officials who use their power to engage in business. It is now learned that the central government has issued a circular to all provinces, cities, and counties in accordance with the resolution to strictly prohibit such activities in order to maintain discipline. At the same time, unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate will be severely punished without exception according to the regulations promulgated in the past.

### Major Fire on Xizang Road Yesterday Morning; Nine Men and Women Killed and Injured; Wang Yongji Weaving Factory Caught Fire Late at Night, Destroying Eight Buildings and Burning for Five Hours

At approximately 0:30 AM yesterday morning, just as people were sound asleep in the middle of the night, a major fire suddenly broke out at the intersection of North Xizang Road and Haining Road. The fire raged uncontrollably, destroying a total of eight buildings and causing nine deaths and injuries. The details are as follows:

Simple Houses: At approximately 0:30 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the Wang Yongji Weaving Factory at No. 23 and 25, Yonghe Lane, No. 246 North Xizang Road, for unknown reasons. Since the houses in the area were simple and stacked on top of each other, resembling pigeon coops, the fire had already spread rapidly and was unstoppable. Everyone, groggy from sleep and in a panic, fled for their lives.

Burning for Five Hours: Some residents were still frantically trying to move their belongings, while a few others desperately used quilts and other items to suppress the fire. However, the fire was fierce, and the flames had spread to No. 1187 Haining Road across the street. Upon receiving the news, the fire brigade rushed to the scene with fire trucks to put out the fire. They were initially unable to control it, and the fire spread from No. 1187 to No. 1197, along with No. 23 and 25, Yonghe Lane, destroying a total of eight houses. It was not until approximately 6:00 AM yesterday morning that the fire was extinguished, burning for a total of five hours.

Death and Injuries: In this pile of rubble, five bodies were dug out, all charred beyond recognition, a truly pitiful sight. It was learned that one of them was an apprentice, a native of Changzhou, who had just arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM the day before to work as an apprentice in the Wang Yongji Weaving Factory. He tragically lost his life in the fire that very night. In addition, four people were injured after jumping from buildings to escape the flames. An elderly woman, Yue Wang, had a broken leg; Wang Jinfu (22 years old) injured both legs. They were sent to Renji Hospital. Jiang Shaoming and Lou Jianzhai had minor injuries and were sent to the North Xizang Road Refugee Hospital for treatment.

At the time, ten bags of altered rice were found. The bookkeeper, Xu Guisheng (the manager is Jin Benren), was arrested and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Fang Fushu, prosecuted him for fraud. Xu Guisheng admitted to the charges and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him.

### Jealousy Leads to Stabbing of Concubine; Concubine's Lover Commits Suicide with a Knife

Zhao Wenhu, a native of Ningbo, and his wife, Zhou Yuying (26 years old, from the same village as Zhao), lived in a rented room on the third floor of No. 10, Laoshou An Lane, No. 134 Rue M. de Boyet, west of the Eight Immortals Bridge. Zhao worked on a ship and was often away from home. During her husband's absences, Zhou had an affair with Ge Shaozhou, a native of Shaoxing (39 years old). This had been going on for some time. Ge had spent a great deal on Zhou. Recently, Ge became unemployed and had nothing to do. Zhou became disgusted with Ge Shaozhou, fell in love with someone else, and became cold and indifferent to Ge. Ge, unable to bear the resentment, went to Zhou's residence with a sharp knife around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. He took out the knife and stabbed Zhou in the throat. Zhou fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Ge stabbed himself in the throat three times with the knife and immediately fell to the ground, dying. The second landlord, Ms. Wei Feng, was awakened by the noise and reported the incident to the French Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. Zhou was first sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, and Ge's body was sent to the morgue for examination. However, Zhou's injuries were also serious. She was already on her last breath upon admission to the hospital, and it is difficult to predict whether her life can be saved.

### Leading Daughter to Withdraw Money from Bank Uncovers Bizarre Theft Case; Tourist at Yipinxiang Loses Passbook; Arrest of Daughter Leads to Capture of Mastermind

Yu Junren, recently arrived in Shanghai from the inland areas, was staying in Room 7 of the Yipinxiang Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. At noon on July 27, Yu returned to his room from outside and suddenly noticed that his luggage had been rummaged through. Upon inspection, a fountain pen, a Shanghai Bank passbook with a balance of over 2,000 yuan, a Kunming China Bank passbook with a balance of 8,000 yuan, two seals, and paper documents were all

Missing. He immediately negotiated with the hotel, arguing that he had locked the room when he went out, and how could the valuables in the room disappear without a trace? Even if it was not theft by the tea server, the hotel should bear considerable responsibility. He then reported the information to the Laozha Police Station, which sent detective Chen Junfeng to investigate. On one hand, he urgently went to the Shanghai Bank to stop payment. Unexpectedly, around 11:00 AM the day before, a modern woman took the passbook to the Shanghai Bank to withdraw money and was apprehended by the police.

The woman claimed that her name was Yang Sujuan and that she was a singer at the Tao Tao Xiang Guide. On the afternoon of the 27th, Shu Changlin, a native of Ningbo and a guest at Room 92, Jiangsu Hotel, No. 50, Lane 397, Fourth Malu, had made a phone call to her. For four consecutive nights, she did not receive a single penny. Suddenly, Shu gave her a passbook and asked her to withdraw money. She was arrested while withdrawing money. Detective Chen, based on the confession, went to Room 92 of the Jiangsu Hotel and arrested Shu, confiscating two seals, a checkbook, and 80 yuan in cash, all taken to the police station.

With the arrest of the mastermind, Yang Sujuan was released because she was not involved. Yesterday morning, Shu Changlin was sent to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Peng Qixin, prosecuted him according to law. The victim, Yu Junren, also hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to appear in court and file a civil suit, arguing that the Yipinxiang Hotel should not be so negligent, allowing anyone to enter the room, and should bear considerable responsibility, requesting to reserve the right to prosecute. Questioned by the defendant, Shu Changlin, he confessed to the theft. Judge Qiu ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, pending further investigation at a later date.

### Price Increase in July (Part 1); Cost of Living Index Rises; US Announces Freezing of Funds and Goods; Most Prices Rise; Workers' Purchasing Power Decreases; Consumption Habits Unchanged

The cost of living index for workers in Shanghai decreased in June but rose again in July. The overall index for June was 757.96, and it rose to 800.31 in July, an increase of 42.36 points, or 5.59%. The purchasing power of the national currency fell from 1 jiao, 3 fen, 1 li, and 9 hao last month to 1 jiao and 2.5 fen, a decrease of more than half a fen. The classified indexes increased from 3.30% (miscellaneous) to 6.24% (food). The indexes for June and July are listed below. Due to the increased cost of production and higher freight rates for Shanghai Municipal Council's small-grain rice, the selling price per stone was raised from 110 yuan to 116 yuan on July 8. Subsequently, due to the development of the Far Eastern situation and the subsequent exchange rate reduction on July 9, both imported rice and local rice saw price increases. However, due to the thick inventory and abundant sources, the trend followed it down. The Shanghai Municipal Council's rice price gradually fell below the limited price of 116 yuan. On July 26, the United States announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds. Food rice, flour, oil beans, sugar, kerosene, cigarettes, soap, matches and other items saw an increase again. Of the 55 items in this index, 7 remained unchanged, 35 increased (by 0.23% to 72.48%), and 10 decreased (by 0.24% to 20.41%).

### Methods of Memory for Reading (4)

— Hu Deling

V. The Most Effective Method of Memory for Reading: The most effective method of memory for reading only requires attention to the following:

(1) Before we begin memorizing, we should know exactly what and how much we need to memorize.

(2) Skim through the reading material. Before we proceed with memorization, understand its meaning carefully.

(3) Memorizing the entire meaning is better than memorizing it in parts.

(4) If it is a very long section, it can be divided into several small sections according to the unit of thought, memorized separately, and finally memorized with the chain of thought linking these sections.

(5) If we want to memorize something read in a very short time, we have to memorize it in several long working hours. But if we want to memorize it for a long time, we should extend it to a long time and then memorize it again in a very short time.

(6) Often review what we have memorized.

(7) If we only want to remember the meaning and not the words, we must be able to describe the main points in our own words. Look for examples from our own experience. After each reading, we must review the main idea in our own words, and then read the full text to see if we have accurately understood it.

VI. Key Points to Increase Reading Memory: The key points to increase reading memory are: (1) Strengthen our bodies and prevent the function of each organ from stagnating.

(2) Make the impressions felt in the early morning clear, so as to arouse interest in reading.

(3) Focus attention on the items that should be remembered.

(4) Understand the content of the memory item to supplement the lack of memory.

(5) Summarize the main points of the items that should be remembered, making them easy to recall.

(6) Make a table explanation of the items that should be remembered.

(7) Give a clear analysis and comparison of the similar points and differences to facilitate recall.

(8) Repeatedly practice the items that should be remembered, which can also promote our memory.

(9) Always imagine the items that should be remembered.

(10) Memory is mainly based on gradual accumulation. Memorizing several things at the same time will inevitably lead to confusion.

VII. Is it Necessary to Painstakingly Seek Strong Memory in Reading?

The common saying that one cannot remember what one reads is probably still because one is reading superficially and has not understood the content clearly. If the content and theory are understood clearly, and the principles are also understood clearly, one will not fail to remember it. Even if one cannot remember all of it, most of it will have left an invisible impression in one's mind. When looking at similar books in the future, it will be much easier than reading the first book. Someone said, "Examining today's students, they often only know how to read, but do not seek understanding. They do not understand the theory of what is described in the book, and they are completely ignorant of the main idea of the book. They only seek to memorize it by rote without understanding it. No wonder it is difficult to remember. When I read, I do not seek to remember the words, but only to understand the paragraphs. The main idea of the paragraphs is clear, which is better than true knowledge and true learning, imprinted in my mind, becoming my knowledge and learning." This means that reading does not require painstaking seeking of strong memory. Strong knowledge is rote memorization. One must understand the theory and principles in the book, and one will naturally gain true knowledge and true learning from the book, and can even consider the knowledge and learning in the book as one's own.

"Reading memory is ordinary, this is not to be worried about, what is needed is first of all fearing no perseverance, secondly fearing casualness, going through it once, and not seeing clearly, this is a great illness if it is really seen clearly, after a long time, one will definitely gain some taste, if there is a pleasant state in the heart, then one will naturally remember it," see Zeng Wenzheng Gong's Family Letter (letter to Ji Ze on June 14th, Xianfeng 9th year).

"For any book that has difficult explanations, there is no need to seek a deep understanding immediately. If there is a word that cannot be remembered, there is no need to painstakingly seek strong memory. Just take your time to ponder it. Read it ten thousand times today, and ten thousand times tomorrow. After a long time, it will naturally be beneficial" - see the same (letter to the brothers on May 26th, Xianfeng 5th year).

"Reading without seeking strong memory is also a way to cultivate oneself... Remembering is okay, not remembering is also okay, this heart is wide and unburdened, on the contrary, I feel comfortable, or I may be able to remember one or two places, it is also not certain" - see the same (letter to the brothers on July 8th, Xianfeng 5th year)

"...Memorizing by force, remembering by force, reviewing by force, will definitely not be thoroughly familiar for a long time, and will only waste daily effort" - see the same (letter to the brothers on January 18th, Xianfeng 5th year) - From this, we can know that reading does not require painstaking seeking of strong memory. Otherwise, we will soon forget it, and painstaking seeking of strong memory is enough to harm people's nature, becoming more and more stupid as we read. Taking your time to ponder it, flipping through it often, and passing through the eyes often, one can naturally remember it unconsciously. (The End)

### Toxic and Non-Toxic

— Xiao Yun

When a person is emotionally excited, not only is there a psychological impact, but there are also significant changes in physiology. According to psychologist Cannon, fear, anger, and love are the three basic human emotions, and all other emotions are evolved from these three. During fear and anger, our heart beats faster, our breathing becomes rapid, our pupils dilate, our body hair stands on end, the consumption of sugar in our body increases, and the function of new metabolism accelerates. Our body has an invisible force that needs to be released. These forces were originally used by primitive humans to fight wild beasts or enemies. However, modern people no longer need to exert such physical strength. Therefore, when emotions are excited, a question arises: how should we vent or utilize these forces?

Experts in mental hygiene tell us that emotional forces have two uses. One is to use them for destructive purposes. For example, when we are dissatisfied with the status quo, we can rage and throw cups and vases all over the place. However, this way of expressing emotions is childish and does not help. On the other hand, we can use these forces constructively. We can look to the future, engage in establishing plans, and try to improve or overthrow the status quo. Revolutions and innovative movements in the world belong to this category.

When a person is moved by a work of art, a play, or a movie, an emotional force is also generated. Here, we can divide works of art into two major categories: one is anesthetic, which makes people confused and infatuated; the other is stimulating, which clears people's minds and allows them to see a clear path. The former is toxic and should be eliminated; the latter is beneficial to the public and should be recommended and introduced.

### The Underground Life of the Wartime Capital

— Ya Qin

When you see news of the bombing of Chongqing in the newspapers, or hear this unfortunate news on the radio, you must be worried about my safety, right? Here, I plan to spend a little time and a few sheets of paper to tell you about the air raid situation and the reality of underground life here.

When the air defense observation post discovers a reconnaissance plane (this post is, of course, far outside Chongqing), a triangular red ball is immediately hung on the pole at the alarm station here. The air defense troops then organize everything, but the people act as if nothing has happened, each doing their own thing, but with a sense of vigilance in their hearts!

When there is an actual air raid, a large circular red ball is hung up, indicating that the city is likely to be attacked. At the same time, the alarm station uses a gong as a signal (now they don't use a gong). At this time, the air raid situation display boards at major intersections show the number and direction of the planes, and the location they have reached (this board is a large wooden board made into a map, with Chongqing as the center, and several circles of different radii drawn outside to indicate that the dangerous zone has been reached, etc. There are roads on it, and the planes are moved with pulleys, and the number of planes can also be seen). This display board is marked until the moment of emergency, at which time the people call out, "There's news."

When the planes reach a considerable distance from Chongqing, two circular red balls are hung up; at the same time, an air raid alarm is sounded. At that time, at the entrances of the larger caves (i.e., air raid shelters), there are air raid service vehicles, selling Bagua Dan, Tiger Balm, Taopian, Feier Gao, portable water bottles, etc. The prices are also quite fair. At this time, snack shops such as Wufangzhai and Le Luchun also double their profits, often with overcrowding.

Based on past experience, the interval between the air raid alert and the emergency is about half an hour. Therefore, fifteen minutes after the air raid alert, people stream into the caves. Take the better cave I'm hiding in as an example: there are electric lights all the way from the entrance to the inside, well-built stone steps, about ninety steps in total, so you can imagine the depth. The inside walls are all paved with stone. The top is arched, and there are long benches in two places, in the style of the fourth-class carriages of the former Jinghu Railway. The seats are quite comfortable. When the emergency arrives, the alarm station immediately takes down the balls and issues an emergency alarm. In the cave where I am, the electric lights (connected to the outside line) gradually go out, just like when a movie theater starts showing a film. The small electric lights powered by our own storage batteries then flash on and off three times, and then stay on.

The cave I'm hiding in is one of the best in Chongqing. At least the people hiding inside are from the middle or upper classes. Underground, it is connected in all directions, with more than eleven exits, with a total of more than 20,000 people. The air raid shelter permit for this cave was priced at 100 yuan last year, and has now risen to 200 yuan; and it is not easy to buy. The companies that sell tickets divide the cave into shares, and arrow-shaped wooden signs are nailed to the beginning and end points, so if you have a permit, you can sit in a certain place without having to rush. Because there are electric lights inside, we can read newspapers, read novels, and even better, colleagues can chat and laugh together. When incoming planes drop bombs somewhere or a fire starts somewhere, someone reports it. After waiting for a while, vendors operating inside also come with boxes, selling Guanggan, Taopian, fresh orange juice, soda, peanuts, just like in a train, except for tea eggs and bread. Of course, sometimes the top of the cave will occasionally be hit by one or more 300- or 500-pound bombs, so people in the cave, whether they are Sichuanese or not, will say in a humorous tone: "Mo kai qiang, (meaning don't talk) qing jing." Then the cave is shaken. When the person responsible for reporting the news reports that the planes have left the city, everyone starts "bai longmen zhen" (i.e., chatting casually), laughing and joking (some don't "kai qiang" because their own houses have been bombed). It’s all the same as before.

When the incoming planes have left the danger zone, two more red balls are hung on the alarm station. This indicates that the planes have left the country and it is possible to go out of the cave to rest, so everyone jokingly calls them "rest balls." At this time, the situation is slightly the same as during the air raid, because when another plane is discovered, these two balls are immediately removed, the same as in an emergency. At this time, the air raid service team, the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts... all mobilize and rush to the disaster area to rescue people, climb into the houses that have been bombed, looking for people who may be buried inside, or cleaning up the streets and other work.

The plane has moved far away from Chongqing, so a long, round green ball (looks like a peanut from a distance) replaces the two red balls, and the alarm also sounds a long note. Everyone comes out of the cave to see if their homes are safe. At this time, the craftsmen of the power company immediately connect the power lines in the disaster area and erect the power poles. The craftsmen of the water company also connect the broken water pipes. What usually takes a day to complete now only takes two or three hours. Stores on the street that have not been bombed are of course immediately open for business, and some damaged stores also have the words "Business as usual" written on the door. Stores that have been bombed into flat ground are writing: "Reopen at the original site in the shortest possible time." At that time, there will inevitably be unexploded bombs on the street, so there are wooden signs nearby with the words: "Unexploded bombs, pedestrians be careful." Unfortunately, some people have lost their warm homes. Rich people, of course, have no problem, but it's okay for those who have no money, because there are temporary shelters to live in, and there is also emergency relief money to receive, and steamed buns and porridge from relief organizations or the Red Swastika Society to eat. If there is no capital to operate, there are also places to borrow money.

These few days, there have been continuous air raids again, and many houses in the city have been turned into flat ground, but these many houses will soon be rebuilt, and their spirit will be even stronger than before.

11. Midnight Song

"Actually... I... I was going to tell you! Dad." She also knew that her father was not a clumsy farmer, and it would not be easy to deceive him; and from childhood to now, she had never told him a lie. Besides these two points, Shang Lao Er's repeated questioning of when she could ask her father to write that apprenticeship note also made her unable to tell Qiu Haitang her suffering early, so she decided to tell the truth. "Starting last month, Shang's maternal uncle has been asking me to sing opera there..."

Before Mei Bao could finish the last sentence, Qiu Haitang had already jumped up from the stool he was sitting on.

"Why do you want to learn opera?" He forced himself to suppress the anger in his heart and asked in an unnatural voice.

Mei Bao was originally standing against the wall with her head down. When she realized that her father's voice was a little strange, and then raised her head, Qiu Haitang's face was as blue as if it had been dyed with indigo; in his two eyes, which had lost their spirit after the illness, there was an unprecedented fierce light, which made Mei Bao so frightened that she cried out.

"Dad!... Dad...! Why are you so angry? Didn't you used to sing opera outside yourself—?"

In her heart, she thought these words were very correct; since her father used to be an opera singer, why should he be so angry now that his daughter is learning opera?

But how could she know that these words just poked at the scar in her father's heart.

"Nonsense!" The flames of anger instantly boiled Qiu Haitang's entire body of blood. (174)

### Mother-Son Bomb

— Li Yi

In order to increase the destructive power of explosives, experts in the manufacture of munitions often have various special designs for shells or bombs in order to achieve the greatest destructive purpose. Recently, Mr. Barker of the United States invented a new type of bomb, which is to add a ring of small bombs to the bombs used in airplanes. These small bombs can leave the mother bomb at a certain height, making the explosive force particularly fierce and expanding the bombed area. Barker has now submitted the model and drawings of this mother-son bomb to the US military authorities for adoption.

### A View on the Past and Present of Female Yue Opera (Part 1)

— Jin Tao

I haven't watched Du Ban for many years, because I have no connection with it. Although there was a period when my late father, when he was alive, had a joint venture with friends in Zhabei to run the New Stage, once "Luan Tan" stopped performing and changed to singing Du Opera. I had a long-term complimentary ticket and watched it once, and never listened to it again. I thought that the female roles singing with a loud throat were really a bit creepy. Later, when I returned to my hometown, I heard that the neighboring village was performing a female Du Ban. My subjective opinions were too deep, and it still didn't arouse my desire to "watch" it. In the past seven or eight years, Shanghai's female Yue Opera (i.e., Du Opera) has become popular for a while, and recently it has even shown a tendency to surpass everything else, which really surprised me a bit.

A few days ago, the China Women and Children Relief General Association's fundraising committee and the Shengxin Female Yue Opera community jointly performed a charity performance at the Golden Theater. I received a few tickets from the association. The weather was still cool, and I had more free time during the summer vacation, so I went to appreciate it. After watching it, I was very happy, happy that it has improved so quickly and reformed so much. In summary, its advantages are as follows.

(1) Costumes In the past, when men sang Du Opera, people often criticized them, saying that their shirt collars were as black as dried plums from local produce. Although the main characters wore better clothes, some of the "assistants" looked like beggars singing lotus songs. Now the female Yue Opera community does not have the above bad impressions at all. They have both "cleanliness and brightness." Several famous actors have several stage costumes that even the Peking Opera community may not be able to surpass.

(2) Playwriting In the past, Du Ban only sang a few plays over and over again. Now female Yue Opera has many new plays, and some of the themes are noble, novel, and not clichéd.

(3) Backstage In the past, Du Opera only had one or two people backstage. Besides "Di Du Di Du" and Ba Hu, there was nothing else. Now female Yue Opera has increased the backstage to six or seven people. Gongs, drums, sanxian, banhu... all are available. With this accompaniment during the performance, the tone will naturally not feel too monotonous.

(4) Appearance The actors in the former Du Opera all came from rural villages, so their makeup was too gaudy. The rouge was applied like rotten peaches, and the white powder was applied like clay dolls. They looked either full of rural air or like thieves. Now the female Yue Opera is very particular about appearance. If you don't open your mouth to sing and just look at the costume, you will definitely think you are watching Peking Opera. Kun Dan Zhao Wan Shuang, with a beautiful appearance and a clear voice, has many plays and has performed in Tianjin, Hankou, and other ports, winning many praises. She is currently the main actor at the Golden Grand Theater. The picture on the right is a recent photo of her.

### The Yifeng Society Announces its Dissolution

The Yifeng Society, led by Zhou Xinfang, has been performing at the Carlton for more than two years. Now, due to various reasons, after Zhou Xinfang stopped performing, it is difficult to continue the performance. Therefore, it has announced its dissolution a few days ago. The members have been given ten days of silver and are looking for their own way out. When the Yifeng Society is reorganized in the future, they will cooperate again.

### After Watching "City of Temptation"

— Zhou Zhen

The eighth art, film, can be said to be fully expressed in this film "City of Temptation," but this is just my personal opinion.

"City of Temptation" is the first masterpiece of the great French director René Clair after arriving in the United States, so his directing style is still very unique, and the editing technique is also extraordinary. Those engaged in domestic films can use it as a reference for directing and photography techniques. Although the plot is very simple, it cannot escape the consistent style of American films - a love triangle: a beautiful noblewoman, who flirts between a wealthy old gentleman and a young and handsome American ship owner, has to associate with the old gentleman for the attraction of money, and has to be intimate with the American ship owner for spiritual comfort; however, a marriage built on money is ultimately not solid. When the wedding march is played, the bride suddenly "faints," uses this to escape, and flees to the ship. As a result, she travels on the boat with the American ship owner to spend her sweet time.

The noblewoman is played by Marlene Dietrich, who performs vividly. Her noble posture, gorgeous costumes, and arrogant demeanor are truly lifelike; on the one hand, she plays a prostitute in a lower-class hotel, which is most suitable for her personality. The details of her facial expressions can be said to be profound. Lauren Young and Bruce Cabot play the old gentleman and the American ship owner, respectively, which is also just right. Other small actions have the style of the famous director Lubitsch. In short, this film is definitely worth watching in the hot summer season. After I walked out of the Grand Guangming, I still felt a special taste in my heart.

Chapter 13 Not Willing to Bow Down in the Wilderness

Xu Jing and Liu Yinying observed the situation and asked for news. They first checked into a guest house, put down their luggage, and then asked about the location of the General Military's office to inquire about the whereabouts of Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei. It was really a coincidence, as the sound of bells rang, a big man with a curly beard galloped on horseback to the entrance of the office. Xu Jing looked back and saw that it was Zhang Cangqiu. He stepped forward and called out, "Brother!" Zhang Cangqiu was not expecting that Xu Jing would come here. He looked down and saw his old friend, quickly jumped off his horse, shook hands with Xu Jing, and said, "Brother, have you been well since we last met? Why did you come to Guanwai today?" Xu Jing replied, "It's a long story, I'll tell you slowly later. Where is Second Brother Chen now?" Zhang Cangqiu said, "He's probably in the office, he arrived before me. Brother, please come in with me to meet him." Xu Jing nodded and said, "Okay," and then introduced Liu Yinying to Zhang Cangqiu. Zhang Cangqiu heard that he was Xu Jing's friend, and also saw that Liu Yinying had a handsome appearance and stood with Xu Jing, like two shining jade trees, so naturally he treated him differently. He led the horse, accompanied the two, and walked into the General Military's office together. Zhang Cangqiu handed the horse over to a soldier to lead away, and he led Xu Jing and Liu Yinying through the General Military's hall, through the corridor, to a room. That was an office. Zhang Cangqiu did not want to disturb the crowd, so he walked to the door of the room and waved inside. Chen Fei had already run out. Zhang Cangqiu laughed at him and said, "Second Brother, look who's here!" He pointed his hand at Xu Jing. Chen Fei had already said, "Oh, it turns out to be Brother Xu Jing, it's rare, it's rare." Xu Jing also stepped forward to greet him and called out, "Second Brother." Zhang Cangqiu then led them to the reception room to sit down. Xu Jing also introduced Liu Yinying to Chen Fei. Liu Yinying saw that Zhang Cangqiu had a heroic appearance, no less than Qiu Ran Ke among the three heroes of the wind and dust, and Chen Fei was also of a burly build, truly outstanding men. He was happy that this trip was not in vain. Xu Jing opened his mouth and said, "You two old brothers must be rising in the world and very proud. I have been thinking of you every day since we parted. I am very happy to meet my brothers again today." (131)

### Scenes of the Singing Stage

— Kou Hong

The Shengxin Female Yue Opera Troupe previously raised money for the disaster relief in Sangxin, and performed at the Renewal Stage to raise funds. Most of the tickets were sold by the Yue Opera actors who participated in the performance themselves. As a result, Xiao Dangui's performance ranked first, and the three flowers and one Juan lost their color! Xiao Dangui's appearance is not stunning, but her acting skills are vivid and fragrant; unlike a certain popular actor who just steals empty fame and is like a piece of wood on stage. She also has a good relationship with people offstage. It is no coincidence that she has achieved this result.

Many of my friends like Yue Opera. Occasionally, I discuss the color and artistry of the current popular Yue Opera actors with them. Some praise Yao Shuijuan, some praise Yuan Xuefen, some praise Xiao Dangui, and some admire Xing Zhuqin. However, someone in the seat, appreciates beyond the appearance and strongly asserts that Zhu Shuizhao's beauty is incomparable. I have not seen Zhu Shuizhao's play, let alone her true face in Lushan, so I dare not say anything rashly. However, I think the two words "Shuizhao" are too vulgar, which is not like a girl's beautiful name. Perhaps it is because of this reason that she cannot be as famous as Shuijuan and Xuefen?

(27) Yu Shuyan

Yu Shuyan was the son of Ziyun and the grandson of Sansheng. As a child actor, he was called Little Yu Sansheng. He performed in Tianjin and Gukou, and his reputation was very high. Some people said that Sansheng had a grandson, enough to carry on his ancestral martial arts. However, after examining what he was good at at that time, although he was also proficient in both civil and military skills, he was actually mixed and vulgar. Seeking to achieve elegance and domestication, he could only compete with Li Jiri and others. Those who knew him did not approve of him. He then stopped performing due to a hoarse voice and was listed in the large family. He then followed the right path and focused on imitating Tan. He worked hard and encouraged himself, and also learned from Chen Yanheng, and made many unique inventions in Tan's tunes, so that Tan's unique skills would not be lost. Yu Shuyan and Yan Jupeng were relied upon, and Chen Yanheng's contribution was particularly great. After the hoarse voice, he hid his skills for more than ten years, hoping to amaze the world with a single feat. He regarded himself as a successor to the old Tan and did not care about small achievements. He gradually joined the same class as Mei Lanfang, and his name became very famous. Later, Lanfang went to Hankou, and he also worked with Shang Xiaoyun or Yang Xiaolou, and his reputation increased, so he established an unshakable foundation. Now, when people talk about the Taishan Beidou among old students, they must first mention Shuyan, without any special arguments.

### Strolling in the Art World

— Yuan Shen

The Lianxing Film Company, organized by Mei Xi, Zhang Jieping, and others, is almost ready for preparation. In terms of lineup, Mei Xi is currently contacting various parties, and probably many drama talents can participate.

After the suspension of "Fengbo Pavilion," all parties are very concerned. Now Huasheng has the determination to re-perform it. Recently, Huang He, who plays Yue Fei, is requesting the authorities to pass the script, and the location for the re-performance may be abandoned at the Grand Theater and changed to the Carlton.

Xia Xia and Mei Cun are in the hospital. The colleagues of the Juyi Society have all signed a letter of condolence. Now Xia Xia and Mei Cun have recovered from their illnesses and been discharged from the hospital one after another. Xia Xia's body is more plump than before. Hongying will perform a play. Directed and written by Cai Bingbai, it is decided to make the scenery by themselves and give a grand performance.
