### The Fierce Battles Along the Zhejiang and Fujian Coasts Continue; Japanese Troops Blocked from Advancing in Fuyang; JinHua Suffers Air Raid, One Japanese Plane Shot Down; Chinese and Japanese Armies Confront Each Other Outside Fuzhou

Chongqing: According to a preliminary war report from Fujian Province, the Chinese army withdrew to the mountains northwest of Fuzhou, lined up and guarded the area. When the Japanese army advanced westward along the north bank of the Min River from Lianjiang, the Chinese army systematically destroyed Fuzhou's military facilities and defensive works before withdrawing. In Zhejiang Province, the Japanese army is still advancing towards Jinhua along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Zhuji. Jinhua was bombed twice yesterday afternoon. It is reported that one Japanese bomber was shot down by Chinese anti-aircraft guns and destroyed near Lanxi. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Fuzhou: Judging from the current situation, the Japanese army seems to be trying to occupy the entire Fujian Province. It is reported that it has assembled a large army of 200,000 men to carry out this plan. The troops stationed near Yanning, 120 miles northeast of Fuzhou, are said to have mutinied. The waterways and roads connecting Yanping Shuikou and Fuzhou are now full of Chinese troops and have been heavily bombed by Japanese planes in recent days. Residents of Fuzhou are uneasy due to the arrival of large numbers of Japanese troops, but there have not been many unexpected incidents. It is reported that Li Shijia will be selected to fill the position of provincial chairman. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Fuzhou: Mr. Neilson, a British supervisor of the Salt Revenue Audit Office here, was detained when he returned from an external inspection and encountered the advance party of the invading Japanese army. Neilson is well known throughout China. The Japanese have established a new regime here and are expected to use military notes, calculated at 220 national currency units to 100 Japanese yen. During the short period between the withdrawal of the Chinese army and the entry of the Japanese army, many administrative offices and officials' residences were looted and destroyed. There is a severe shortage of fresh meat and vegetables, and it is reported that efforts are being made to provide relief. Large numbers of Japanese troops are passing through the area daily, heading upstream. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Tokyo: According to Japanese sources in Fuzhou, the foreign concessions along the Min River in Fuzhou have returned to normal. 90% of foreign tea interests are concentrated there. Shops and schools have resumed normal operations. Yuyao, more than 80 kilometers northwest of Ningbo, was captured by the Japanese army yesterday despite strong resistance from the Chinese army. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Chinese army told reporters this afternoon that the purpose of the Japanese army's operations along the Zhejiang and Fujian coasts may be to seek auxiliary bases for the navy and air force, as well as supply bases, in preparation for a southward advance in the Pacific. The spokesman also said that the purpose of the Japanese army's actions is definitely not to intensify the blockade of China or to disrupt the concentration of Chinese troops. Otherwise, why would they launch it four years into the war? Regarding the current war situation in Zhejiang Province, the Japanese army advancing from Fuyang has been blocked by the Chinese army. The main force of the Japanese army in Zhuji may be forced to move southeast. The Japanese army in the Ningbo area is currently advancing towards Fenghua. The spokesperson continued that after the fall of Fuzhou, the two armies are now confronting each other in the suburbs. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Chongqing: Chinese military authorities announced today that the Japanese army advancing southward from Zhuji was forced to retreat to near Zhuji after suffering 4,000 casualties in fierce fighting yesterday. The Japanese army was repulsed by the Chinese army during its main assault and retreated northward to the defensive positions south of Zhuji. A Chinese official military spokesman, when discussing the Japanese army's operations in Zhuji, compared this determined Japanese offensive to the previous offensives in Yichang and Nanchang. He said that the past sporadic offensives have completely failed, showing that the Japanese army is unable to launch a concentrated and comprehensive offensive to end the war against China. When talking about the purpose of the Japanese army's coastal operations, the spokesman said that the Japanese army's occupation of Fuzhou and Ningbo was to prevent the United States from using these places as submarine bases to counter Japan. "I think this analysis is quite accurate," he said, adding that the Japanese army's current operations are the first step in Japan's southward advance. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

Hong Kong Newspaper Commentary: Zhejiang-Fujian War

Hong Kong's Chinese and foreign newspapers have recently published articles with headlines about the Zhejiang-Fujian war, but most editorials focus on Japan's actions. The newspapers believe that Japan is unable to end the war against China. The "South China Morning Post" stated that the Japanese army's occupation of Yin and Min should not be overemphasized. The Japanese army's launch of the Zhejiang-Fujian war is merely to inject new vitality into its increasingly corrupt army. The "Ta Kung Pao" stated that Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou are also being blockaded by Japan. The loss of these three places will definitely not determine the war in China. China's base of operations has long been moved from the coast to the interior. It is generally believed that coastal defense is no longer important. (Dispatch, 24th)

Chongqing: This morning's editorial in the "Ta Kung Pao" stated that the war on the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian is a prelude to Japan's southward advance in the Pacific. It is now known that the Japanese are using at least four divisions in this campaign, including the Konoe Division and the 5th, 18th, and 28th Divisions, which are said to be the elite of the Japanese army. This campaign is more important than the previous Japanese landings at Dapeng Bay and other coastal locations in Guangdong Province. The scale is also far greater. The Japanese commander-in-chief intends to seize important seaports in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces before advancing in the South Pacific to prevent enemy forces from using them as submarine bases to attack Japanese ships departing from bases in Taiwan and Hainan Island. Therefore, the current war in Zhejiang and Fujian is clearly more important than intensifying the coastal blockade. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

### National Government Allocates One Million Yuan to Relieve Famine in Eastern Guangdong; Ma Chaojun Dispatched with Funds to Handle Relief; Hong Kong Chinese Also Donate One Million Hong Kong Dollars

Chongqing: The Chinese government has allocated one million yuan in national currency to relieve the famine in eastern Guangdong and coastal cities in the southwest. It is reported that Hong Kong Chinese have also donated one million Hong Kong dollars to relieve the suffering of ten million people directly affected by the famine in eastern Guangdong. The famine-stricken area in eastern Guangdong covers an area of 10,000 square miles. The National Government has dispatched Ma Chaojun, the former mayor of Nanjing, with these million yuan to Guangdong to relieve the coastal cities in the southwest. These cities have recently been plundered by the Japanese, and it is reported that all food, clothing, and other items have been taken away by the Japanese. Before the war, Guangdong Province relied heavily on imports of rice from Vietnam and Thailand. However, since the Japanese occupied the areas around Hong Kong and Shantou and frequently block coastal traffic, the supply of rice has been drastically reduced. According to an official from the National Relief Commission, the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Central Government are making every effort to transport supplies to the affected areas, not only to Guangdong but also to Hunan and Jiangxi. People close to the Guangdong Provincial Government told the Associated Press that the famine in eastern Guangdong was partly caused by heavy rains last winter, which destroyed many crops. Li Hanhun, the Chairman of Guangdong Province, is currently in Changsha conferring with General Xue Yue, requesting that 70,000 shi of Hunan rice be immediately transported to eastern Guangdong. The Jiangxi Provincial Government is already transporting 50,000 shi of rice to Guangdong. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

Only yesterday did it become known that the State Department is investigating this matter. Unofficial predictions are that the U.S. government may ask the German government to withdraw several German diplomats stationed in the U.S. because German officials in the U.S. assisted his escape. Attorney General Jackson has instructed U.S. border guards to use any force necessary to return German prisoners who escape from Canada to U.S. territory to Canada and not allow them to enter the U.S., because (these people are abusing the neutrality of the United States).

Without waiting for their request, it was immediately transferred. The Southern mine owners agreed on Tuesday, at President Roosevelt's request, to reopen negotiations with the striking coal miners. The Northern mine owners have already resolved the dispute with the United Mine Workers and agreed to sign a new wage and hour agreement, but the Southern mine owners refused to sign the same terms, forcing the strike to continue and causing a shortage of coal for the defense industry.

Editorial

### Another Proof of Divide and Conquer

At the beginning of the crisis when Yugoslavia underwent a massive change, determined to resist Germany, and the Balkan Peninsula was brewing for war, this newspaper discussed the future of the situation, believing that; assuming the defeat of Germany and Italy, they would collapse immediately, and the Balkan War would become the final act of the European War, so the struggle was decisive in nature for Germany and Italy; assuming the defeat of the British, Greek and Yugoslavian Allied forces, although Greece and Yugoslavia would experience a period of tragic devastation, Britain would certainly continue to resist in various ways, striving for the final victory, and the war situation would continue to expand. Until now, although there is still a final opportunity to dream of Germany turning the tables in a miracle similar to the battles of Thermopylae and Marathon, the general trend indicates that the above-mentioned second assumption of becoming a reality is almost inevitable at present. This is of course a painful page, but not unexpected. According to the propaganda mocked by the German side yesterday, saying that all they see is the backs of British soldiers, saying that there must be British soldiers who have never heard the sound of German artillery; is it that the British army in the Balkans has no will to fight and flees at the slightest sign of trouble? It is only another annotation of what this newspaper pointed out yesterday - the British authorities are unwilling to pay too high a price here, which would restrain the preparation and execution of a decisive battle of the main forces.

From the German eastward attack on Poland, although Britain and France immediately declared war on Germany for fulfilling their mutual assistance promise to Poland, they did not launch an offensive on the Western front to create a diversion in military terms. When Germany attacked Norway to the north, Britain and France dispatched expeditionary reinforcements, but it was a drop in the bucket, and they retreated after a small battle. When Germany launched a full-scale westward attack on the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, the British army responded generously, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the other countries, and the momentum was not considered small, and the sacrifices were not considered insignificant. During the evacuation from Dunkirk, it was extremely desolate and tragic; yet it caused French public opinion at the time not to hate its enemy Germany too much, but to resent its ally, the British army. All these scenes, played out one after another, resulted in the successive fall of one country after another; the most recent scene, in Yugoslavia and Greece in the Balkans, these descriptions make it difficult for people who have not carefully examined the seriousness and complexity of world events but have a gut feeling, not to doubt the credibility, prestige, and sincerity of Britain. In fact, after the First World War, Britain did not want to see military aggression, did not want to see other countries compete for hegemony in the world, and did not want to see Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece controlled by violence. Its sincerity is beyond doubt. As for credibility and prestige, although it cannot be lightly insulted until now, it has indeed been damaged, reduced, but it did not begin with the declaration of war on Germany in 1939, nor did it begin with battles where there was no victory, labor without success after the declaration of war, but it began with the September 18th Incident in the Far East in 1931. This judgment is not merely revealing painful old scars, but is an observation of historical facts.

From the loss of Shenyang, China in the September 18th Incident, ten years to this day, the German occupation of Athens, the capital of Greece, historical facts are clear, and tears and blood are evident. There are countless lessons that can be learned as history; but one thing is particularly important, running through the historical facts of these ten years and is deeply remembered by us; not only remembered, but also believed, and regretted, and we wish that all countries would not forget the lessons of history and change their plans. Let's imagine: if the countries had immediately imposed effective sanctions based on the League of Nations after the September 18th Incident, then East Asia would be peaceful, and the Nazis might not have gained power in Germany. In the subsequent years, for the countries of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, which were cleverly seized by Germany one after another, as well as for the countries of Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece, which were forcibly seized by Germany, if they had seen through Germany's ambitions around 1936, gathered their wisdom and strength, and united in attacking Germany, making Germany face enemies on all sides: Germany's soldiers are elite, how could they be enough to distribute? The weapons are sufficient, where would the resources come from to replenish them? Then what kind of situation would have formed in continental Europe? Breastfeeding this and until around 1939, when Germany suddenly invaded Poland, if France crossed the Maginot Line and took the offensive, and Britain, to the north, invited the countries of Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium, and, to the south, invited the countries of Greece and Yugoslavia, and launched an offensive to support Poland and attack Germany at the same time, then what kind of situation would have formed in continental Europe? If the United States' planned aid to democratic countries in the coming years was provided in the years before today, what would be the effect? Although there is absolutely no possibility of finding accurate answers to all these questions, they have become the most foolish questions; however, the above-mentioned countries, today, have either been destroyed and are experiencing deep regret, or are in a state of war and are suffering deeply; if they occasionally wonder about this, do we not have the feeling of having passed the butcher shop and devouring great meals? If it is said that regret is of no use, it can be seen that it is worth regretting. Because the aggressors carefully select the timing, biting the fat and attacking the weak, and the aggressed are focused on the happiness of peace, focused on the current interests of their own country as the standard for war and peace, focused on flattery or plotting for survival together, focused on assisting abuse or sharing the spoils; and thus they were successively destroyed under the strategy of "divide and conquer". Yugoslavia surrendered first, and Greece was defeated later. They are the most recent victims of divide and conquer.

Of course, there were various obstacles and difficulties in the initial failure to gather wisdom and strength and complete the anti-aggression front early; and military victories and defeats cannot be simply asserted by saying that unity will surely lead to victory; but the fact that they were ultimately conquered by divide and conquer and became the current serious situation is an indisputable fact; if they had joined forces to resist the enemy, the current situation would certainly not be as serious as it is, which is also an inevitable conclusion. The historical lessons are like this, yet there are still countless countries hovering outside the battlefield, taking pleasure in neutrality; such as the Soviet Union, such as Turkey, such as Spain, all uphold peace, all talk about their own country's interests; truly, I do not know what role they will play in future history?

### U.S. Delivers Twenty Torpedo Boats to Britain for Use; New York Mayor LaGuardia Calls for More Aid to Britain

Washington: U.S. Navy Secretary Knox told reporters yesterday that twenty American torpedo speedboats are ready to be delivered to Britain, most of which are already en route. Each can travel more than one mile per minute. The U.S. is currently negotiating to build warships in Canada. What they plan to build are third-class warships. Any warship built by Canada for the U.S. can be delivered to Britain under the Lend-Lease Act. The method can be decided when the warship is completed. When reporters asked about the issue of U.S. aid to Britain and the Atlantic naval battle, Knox replied that he knew that larger and faster freighters are now trying to navigate the danger of German submarines and bomber attacks on their own. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

Washington: Navy Secretary Knox declared that he, President Roosevelt, and Canadian Prime Minister King's Naval Chief of Staff MacDonald had discussed using Canadian shipyards to build small boats for Britain. The torpedo speedboats being transferred have four torpedo tubes, anti-aircraft machine guns, and depth charges. Each boat is 110 to 165 feet long. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

Ottawa: New York Mayor LaGuardia, in a speech at the St. George's Day banquet yesterday, advocated giving more aid to European countries, saying that both Canada and the United States are prepared not only to defend the North American coast but also to defend the sea 200 miles from the coast. Since President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King issued a declaration at Hyde Park stating that Canada and the United States would combine their defense forces to make aid to Britain as effective as possible, he hopes that there will be more aid to Britain in the future. The Mayor of New York also spoke about changes in military technology, saying that armed military forces, no matter how brave, can no longer defend, because in today's war, the winners are the people in the country who grow food in the fields and manufacture weapons in factories. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

New York: Regarding the agreement signed by U.S. President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King, the New York Times and the Washington Post called for the agreement to be implemented immediately in their commentaries. U.S. goods shipped to Canada have surged, and Canada's import surplus reaches 300 million yuan annually. Roosevelt and King expect that the total value of Canadian goods shipped to the U.S. can increase by 200 to 300 million yuan in the next twelve months. The New York Times also stated that the U.S.-Canada agreement not only strengthens Canada's finances but also stipulates the cooperation of U.S. and Canadian wartime industries.

### British Ship Lapland Sunk by Germany

London: The Admiralty announced that the British armed merchant ship Lapland (formerly sailing to Shanghai) has been sunk by a torpedo.

Its sister ship Rawalpindi also resisted the German warship Deutschland's attack after the war and was sunk by it. The Lapland's captain was Mr. Taylor, and the relatives of all those who died have been notified. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

### Severe Bombing in Plymouth, England

Plymouth: After the second consecutive night of heavy bombing of the city by German aircraft, an estimated 100,000 incendiary bombs and 500 high-explosive bombs were dropped.

### 1,000 Aircraft Coordinated by the US and Canada Delivered to the British Air Force; British Aircraft Production Making Monthly Progress, Not Hindered by German Bombing

London: Lord Beaverbrook, Minister of Aircraft Production, stated in the House of Lords yesterday that 1,000 aircraft coordinated by the United States and Canada have been delivered to the British Air Force. Only one aircraft was lost during the transfer. We now feel that American aircraft are comparable to any in the world. Many American aircraft are suitable for combat. When the first Liberator aircraft arrived in England, he was surprised to see that its speed was higher than the Stirling and it carried more bombs. In the past few days, the British Admiralty has received 95 aircraft, 350 tons of aircraft parts, and 326 engines by sea. Transporting aircraft by sea from the United States is, of course, difficult due to the losses suffered by convoys, but we are not discouraged because we know that American aircraft are steadily increasing. The "sky poisoning" system is now urgently needed for development and expansion. Soon, we will be able to transport fighter planes along routes different from those used by bombers. Recently, a bomber destined for Britain crashed into trees upon landing in Newfoundland, damaging the fuselage, and Canadian scientist Sir Frederick Banting died as a result. Lord Beaverbrook spoke of the policy of large-scale decentralized aircraft production, saying that the Germans claim to have inflicted great losses on British aircraft and aircraft production capacity. In fact, enemy bombing has not damaged British aircraft because our factories are all located outside the bombing zones. The British Air Force is expanding rapidly due to the enthusiastic enlistment of pilots and aircrew from the Dominions, and the number of aircraft in reserve is also satisfactory. All five major types of combat aircraft have 100% reserves in various locations. We are still not satisfied with this, feeling that the British Air Force should have reserves of 200% or 300%. While supplies from the United States are increasing daily, our national production should still be regarded as extremely important. In February of this year, we built more fighter planes and bombers than before, and March set a new record, more than two and a half times greater than last year, and exceeding our planned program. Lord Beaverbrook mentioned the injury of Captain Huskinson, the designer of new British bombs, who was temporarily blinded. On the night of April 16th, during an air raid on London, Huskinson got up to observe the effectiveness of the bomb explosions. Unfortunately, shrapnel injured his eyes, but there is still hope of restoring his sight. (April 24th, Reuters report)

### Britain to Reform Convoy System

Washington: It was learned today that British officials may abandon armed escorts for fast merchant ships and make a complete reform of the convoy system in order to speed up the delivery of American military supplies. It is reported that the practice of grouping fast and slow cargo ships together for convoys will be abolished, and instead, fast ships will be used individually to travel quickly across the North Atlantic to avoid being overtaken by submarines. This reform plan is based on a proposal recently made by Rear Admiral Land, Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission, who pointed out that slower ships reduce convoy speed to 12 miles per hour, while many submarines have a surface speed of 12 miles per hour. Naval experts also point out that the new method can also reduce the excessive use of port facilities by convoys. (April 24th, Associated Press report)

### Britain Did Not Invite Matsuoka to Visit

London: British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in response to inquiries in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government did not invite Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka to visit Britain during his European tour. Members of the House have likely seen Matsuoka's remarks to reporters regarding his intentions for his European tour. Member of Parliament Powell asked Eden if he knew that Matsuoka had obtained sufficient, but not excessive, information from the Japanese Ambassador regarding Britain's war efforts. Eden replied, "I cannot answer for the exercise of the duties of another country's ambassador, but I am certain that the Japanese Ambassador is fulfilling his duties." (April 24th, Reuters report)

### Matsuoka Reports on Treaty Negotiations

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka reported to the cabinet this morning at 8:50 AM on the European situation and the circumstances leading to the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese treaty.

Matsuoka then reported on the same matter at a meeting of the Privy Council. In addition to explaining the contents of the treaty and the circumstances leading to its conclusion, he also expressed his observations on the outcome of future negotiations with the Soviet Union regarding commercial and fishing matters. Matsuoka also detailed the recent diplomatic negotiations in the capitals of the Axis powers, as well as the Japanese government's policy toward Chongqing. (April 24th, Associated Press report)

### Japanese Privy Council Approves Neutrality Treaty

Tokyo: Japanese sources say that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty may be approved today. The Privy Council is scheduled to approve the treaty before the Emperor this afternoon. Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke will provide the Privy Council with a detailed report on his decision to visit Europe and the conclusion of the treaty in Moscow at today's meeting.

Attendees include Prime Minister Konoe, Minister of Home Affairs Hiranuma, Minister of War Tojo, Minister of the Navy Oikawa, and Director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau Murase. (April 24th, Associated Press report)

Tokyo: "Diamond" Commercial Weekly recently stated that after the signing of the Neutrality Treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, attention must now be paid to the "China Incident." What will be the situation regarding Soviet aid to China? Some say that the Soviet Union should stop providing aid, while others say that it should continue. However, in reality, it would be difficult for the Soviet Union to immediately stop all aid. Therefore, although the conclusion of the treaty is helpful to world peace, it would be too optimistic to say that Japan will have smooth sailing from now on. (April 23rd, Havas report)

### Sino-American Stabilization Agreement Signature Postponed

Washington: A spokesman for the U.S. Treasury Department stated last night that the Sino-American Stabilization Fund Agreement, by which the U.S. would lend China $50 million to stabilize Chinese currency, will be signed at a later date, but the initial signing may occur on Friday. The spokesman also stated that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau had been focusing on tax defense issues and preparing to present statements to congressional committees for the past two days. Therefore, the signing of the Sino-American Stabilization Agreement may have to be postponed. It had been expected that Morgenthau would sign the agreement today.

### United States to Establish Department of Economic Warfare; Military Experts, Observing German Military Progress, Believe the United States Should Strengthen Tank Forces

Washington: According to reliable sources here last night, since the United States exposed German economic infiltration into the U.S. war industry, the government authorities plan to quickly establish a Department of Economic Warfare. It is reported that at least three departments, the State Department, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Commerce, are drafting plans to submit to President Roosevelt as soon as possible. It is expected that President Roosevelt will establish an agency similar to the British Ministry of Economic Warfare based on the aforementioned proposal.

New York: Senior U.S. Army officers declared last night that the German panzer divisions have once again succeeded in blitzkrieg warfare. This is the fourteenth time the German army has decisively conquered another country. In their view, the U.S. should accelerate the hundreds of millions of dollars in national defense programs to mass-produce giant tanks capable of carrying large cannons, as well as other armored combat vehicles. From secret intelligence obtained by the U.S. government regarding the results of the war in Greece, it is known that the rapid collapse of the Greek army has given the strategists planning the defense of the Western Hemisphere an important lesson. Of the $7 billion requested by President Roosevelt under the Lend-Lease Act, only over $300 million is used for tanks and armored vehicles, while over $1 billion is used for cannons and machine guns. To date, none of this equipment has been transported to bases in the Caribbean, Bermuda, Newfoundland, and Greenland. Army observers said that the British and Greek forces were unable to stop the German advance toward Athens precisely because they lacked this equipment.

### Troops in Two Northern Regions of Greece Implement Armistice with Germany and Italy; Agreement Signed in Thessaloniki; More Than Ten Greek Divisions Become Prisoners of War

Berlin: Headquarters announced that the Greek army in Epirus and Macedonia surrendered starting on Sunday. German forces penetrated deep into the northern flank, causing the commanders of various Greek armies to surrender to the German 12th Army. On the 22nd, a delegation of Greek troops from the province of Epirus surrendered to the Italian 11th Army because the army was surrounded by German and Italian forces from the north and south. The Greek Commander-in-Chief met with the German and Italian commanders in Thessaloniki to negotiate surrender terms. (April 24th, Associated Press report)

Thessaloniki: Yesterday at 2:15 PM, the commanders-in-chief of the German and Italian forces conquering Greece and the commanders of the Greek forces in Epirus and Macedonia formally signed an armistice agreement in a large building in the mountains of Thessaloniki. After the German, Italian, and Greek commanders signed, German General Dietrich delivered a speech, first expressing respect for the fallen soldiers on both sides, then stating that he deeply admired the bravery of the Greek soldiers. Italian Lieutenant General Ferreiro also expressed his admiration. Then, Greek General Tsolakoglou thanked the German and Italian officers and expressed his anticipation that Germany and Italy would abide by the terms of the armistice agreement in the future and treat Greek prisoners of war with chivalry. The armistice agreement took effect at 6:00 PM tonight. German and Italian officers treated the Greek officers negotiating the agreement with great courtesy, allowing them to leave with their swords. Well-informed sources here say that the Greek forces in Epirus and Macedonia now number between ten and twelve divisions. (April 24th, Havas Agency report)

Berlin: A German military spokesman said, "We express our regret for what has happened in Greece, but we admire the Greek army's brave fighting spirit." (April 24th, Havas Agency report)

Capital of Switzerland: According to news from Rome, after the surrender of the Greek army, the Speaker of the Italian Senate delivered a short speech, praising the Greek officers and soldiers for their heroic fighting. (April 23rd, Havas report)

Berlin: Last night, German forces surrounded the Greek forces in southwestern Greece in a small triangular area, cutting off their escape route across Corinth. Since the surrender of the Greek forces on Tuesday, only a few remaining divisions remain in the triangular area, their line extending from Boeotia to Atalanti Bay. The elite of the Greek army have either surrendered or been annihilated. The total number of surrendered troops is 300,000, including 100,000 east of Thessaloniki and 200,000 in Epirus. (April 24th, Associated Press report)

London: The military critic of the Vichy official news agency said that 100,000 Greek soldiers, including the elite troops who have been fighting on the Albanian border since last December, have already surrendered. Thus, the majority of the forces under General Papagos of the Greek army have been lost, with only the troops fighting alongside the British remaining. With the Greek army having surrendered, the area bounded by the Pindus Mountains, the Gulf of Patras, and the Ionian Sea will likely all be opened.

Full Text of the Agreement

Rome: The German and Italian allied forces signed an armistice agreement in Thessaloniki yesterday with the Greek forces in Epirus and Macedonia. The full text is as follows: General Tsolakoglou, Commander-in-Chief of the Greek forces in Epirus and Macedonia, has requested the Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces on the Albanian front and the Commander-in-Chief of the German forces on the Greek front to accept an unconditional surrender. (1) The Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces on the Albanian front and the Commander-in-Chief of the German forces on the Greek front have accepted this request. (2) Greek soldiers in Epirus and Macedonia are all prisoners of war. Because of the Greek army's brave fighting and to maintain the honor of the Greek army, Greek officers will retain their personal equipment and weapons. Italian prisoners in Epirus and Macedonia will be immediately handed over to the Italian army. At the same time, Greek prisoners will be gathered in concentration camps. After the complete cessation of Greek military operations, consideration will be given to releasing all Greek officers. (3) The Greek command will be responsible for ensuring that the Greek army continues to obey officer orders and for taking all steps to implement the surrender process. The Greek army command will temporarily supply food and medicine for Greek prisoners. (4) The weapons, equipment, and supplies of the Greek army and air force in Epirus and Macedonia are all war booty. (5) The Greek commander will be responsible for ensuring that hostilities cease immediately, that weapons and supplies are not further destroyed, and that roads are immediately repaired. (6) All ship loading and unloading and all air traffic in Epirus and Macedonia should cease immediately. (7) The Greek command guarantees that ships in all ports and port facilities will remain under Greek army supervision pending a final decision. (8) The Greek command will appoint plenipotentiary commissioners to implement the details of the surrender. The German and Italian allied forces will also dispatch officers to cooperate. These commissioners will immediately report on the types, strength, and organization of the Greek army in Epirus and Macedonia. (9) The cessation of hostilities agreed upon by the German forces and the Greek forces in Epirus and Macedonia on the 21st of this month will remain in effect. The cessation of hostilities agreed upon by the Italian forces and the Greek forces in Epirus and Macedonia on the 23rd of this month at 6:00 PM will be in effect. Greek forces that have already ceased hostilities on the Italian front are not within the scope of this article. (10) The armistice agreement signed by the Commander-in-Chief of the German forces on the Greek front and the Commander-in-Chief of the Greek forces in Epirus and Macedonia on the 21st of this month will be voided immediately upon the signing of this agreement. Signed on April 23, 1941, in Thessaloniki: General Dietrich, representing the German army; General Ferreiro, representing the Italian army; and General Tsolakoglou, Commander-in-Chief of the Greek forces in Epirus and Macedonia.

### New Greek Prime Minister Issues Proclamation to the People Urging Steadfastness

Athens: New Greek Prime Minister Soutsos issued a proclamation to the people, urging the nation to remain steadfast, saying that one day we will surely be a victorious, glorious, and great nation again. The armistice agreement signed with Germany without government approval is a rash act. This is likely the result of six months of victorious struggle against enemy forces, though numerically superior, which has led to exhaustion, and now they are facing even greater pressure. At this tragic and important moment, I am going to the island of Crete with the King. I am deeply honored by this political and national action, as it demonstrates the unconquerable spirit of Greece and our determination not to surrender to the enemy. (April 24th, Reuters report)

Reasons for the Surrender of Troops in Two Regions

The Athens General Headquarters has issued a communiqué explaining the reasons for the surrender of troops in Macedonia and Epirus, stating that since the collapse of the Yugoslav army, powerful German forces have been able to step up their attacks, breaking through Monastir. Our army, facing the enemy on both sides, had no choice but to retreat. At that time, the German forces south of Monastir had cut off our army's left flank retreat route, and some of our troops, lacking tank defense artillery, were forced to retreat into the mountains, making their retreat route uncertain. As for the main force in Epirus, they bravely fought against Italian forces, who outnumbered them by two to one, for many days. By this point, they had no choice but to join the general retreat. Although the Italian forces launched repeated attacks, our forces there were still able to retreat safely, but the enemy's air force incessantly bombed our forces, and we had virtually no aircraft to counter them. Our army, seeing the vast disparity in strength, painfully surrendered on the evening of the 20th of this month. At that time, not a single Italian soldier had set foot on our soil.

### Young King of Yugoslavia Establishes New Government in the Near East; British Foreign Secretary Declares in the House of Commons that He Will Give the Country the Greatest Assistance

London: British Foreign Secretary Eden told the House of Commons yesterday that the young King Peter II of Yugoslavia has established a new government in the Near East, vowing to fight Germany to the end. (April 24th, Associated Press report)

London: The King and government of Yugoslavia have indeed taken consistent steps with other governments that have fled the country and will continue to fight against the Nazis. British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the Southern government has formally assured the British government that it will continue to loyally stand behind the British government in the capacity of a co-operative nation until victory is achieved. Britain is determined to fully restore the independence of the Southern nation and, to the greatest possible extent, provide the greatest assistance. (April 24th, Reuters report)

### German Troops Approach Athens: Fierce Fighting at Thermopylae Pass; German Aircraft Bomb Retreating Allied Forces; Italy Claims Greek Campaign Nearing End

New York: It was learned here yesterday from a broadcast by Rome Radio that German forces were only sixty miles from Athens at dusk yesterday. (United Press, 24th)

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military communique stated that German troops fighting the rearguard of the British army had broken through the enemy's positions at Thermopylae, capturing thirty tanks between Larissa and Lamia. (Haitong Agency, 24th)

London: Today, responsible sources here stated that although under immense pressure from the German forces, the British and Greek armies are still firmly holding their defensive positions in the Thermopylae area. Rumors of a breakthrough on the British and Greek left flank are unfounded; the entire line remains intact. Another Allied line has now been established south of Lamia. (Reuters, 24th)

Rome: Stefani News Agency has just issued a dispatch stating that the Greek campaign can now be considered nearing its end. With German forces having broken through enemy positions at the Thermopylae Pass and advancing towards Athens, opposed only by troops from the Australian Commonwealth and the New Zealand Dominion, while the main enemy forces have already retreated, the Greek campaign has reached its final stage and can only be prolonged for a few days before it concludes. (Havas Agency, 24th)

Berlin: According to German military sources, German forces have now invaded central Greece and are confronting Australian troops at Thermopylae. Large formations of British troops were bombed by German aircraft, scattering in panic. On the 21st, German aircraft sank four British warships; on the 22nd, they sank seven, totaling 37,000 tons. Twelve more were hit and burned. This is the British army's "Dunkirk" in Greece. In five days, a total of 156,000 tons of shipping has been sunk, and 37 vessels damaged or burned. (Haitong Agency, 24th)

London: Reuters' correspondent with the British forces in Greece reports that a major German offensive against the new British defensive positions in Greece is expected at any moment. British troops are in high spirits, continuing to harass the vanguard of the German forces. Today, British troops are awaiting the full-scale German attack, suffering continuous bombing and strafing by German air force from dawn till dusk. Two British soldiers were captured but later escaped back to British lines. (Reuters, 24th)

Berlin: Officials here declared yesterday that Australian and New Zealand troops, covering the British retreat in Greece, suffered significant losses. German forces captured many New Zealand troops and seized a large quantity of military supplies. The British retreat routes were repeatedly bombed by German aircraft, with roads leading south having been destroyed. (Haitong Agency, 24th)

Berlin: The British Expeditionary Force in Greece is now embarking for evacuation. According to reports from German reconnaissance aircraft, the majority of British troops are embarking on small vessels in remote harbors. (Hayas Agency, 24th)

Athens: The Greek Ministry of Public Security issued a communique yesterday stating that multiple German aircraft repeatedly attacked the Greek ports of Piraeus, Salamis, Attica, and Megara in waves. Ships and facilities were damaged. Civilian casualties were few. One German aircraft crashed in the Aegean Islands, and the crew was captured. (Reuters, 24th)

### German Forces Plan to Occupy All Greek Islands; Lemnos Reportedly Occupied; War Approaching Turkish Coast

Istanbul: At 9 PM last night, an unconfirmed report from the Ankara official radio station stated that German forces had occupied the island of Lemnos in the Aegean Sea, located between Thessaloniki, the Greek Chalkidiki Peninsula, and the Dardanelles Strait. (United Press, 24th)

Cairo: Reliable sources here claimed last night that German forces in Greece have temporarily eased their pressure, allowing British forces to consolidate their new positions. However, the respite is expected to be very brief. Sources here believe that the surrender of the Epirus forces has no impact on Greek initiative. The main body of Greek forces on the British left flank is resolutely holding their ground. The German lines of communication will inevitably encounter difficulties, as their distant supply lines have been severely damaged. This may have some connection with the slight slackening of the German advance. The British forces were able to retreat smoothly into new lines, and the gradual weakening of the German offensive may also be due to heavy losses. According to refugee reports, a German division was transferred back to Germany in mid-month, having lost 65% of its manpower and resources. However, this claim has not yet been confirmed. Reports from Ankara also indicate that German casualties in Greece are extremely heavy. It is said that travelers from Bulgaria reported that German troops stationed in Sofia were astonished by the large number of wounded soldiers being transported there. Various estimates of German losses are circulating in Sofia, one suggesting 60,000 dead and 250,000 wounded. This figure is likely unreliable, but it shows that German casualties are far heavier than the Germans anticipated. Rumors that German forces have occupied Lemnos and Samothrace have not been heard in Ankara. However, well-informed sources believe that the Nazis will attempt to occupy all Greek islands, as these islands, together with the Dodecanese, could form useful air bases. Although the war is approaching the Turkish coast and land borders, the Turkish public remains quite calm. Turkish sentiment can be summarized by the words of opinion leaders, namely, "If we are attacked, we will fight to the end. We have taken all kinds of precautions. Aggressors must know that they cannot catch us off guard." Furthermore, according to a Free French News Agency dispatch from Istanbul, the Bulgarian ambassador to Turkey has assured the Turkish government that the Bulgarian occupation of the Greek port of Dedeagach does not imply any hostile intent towards Turkey. The news agency also reports that some British expatriates from Athens have arrived on the island of Chios off the coast of Asia Minor. (Reuters, 24th)

### Germany Plans to Establish "European Federation" Soon; Great Pressure on Spain; Attack on Gibraltar Imminent

London: It is expected here yesterday that in the near future, all of Europe may be controlled by Germany. It is widely believed that Spain and Portugal will play an important role in this plan. Germany's attack on Gibraltar is only a matter of time. Experts say that if Franco refuses to cooperate, Germany will occupy Spain by force, making it impossible for Portugal to resist. It is reported that Germany, disregarding the famine in France, has ordered the non-occupied zone of France to transport grain to Spain to alleviate the Spanish food crisis. Other supplies are also being shipped from Africa to Spain to force it to cooperate with Germany through goodwill. It is rumored that French Deputy Prime Minister Admiral Darlan and Laval are holding talks in Paris regarding the German plan to control all of Europe. The German ambassador to France, Abetz, will also participate. France shows strong signs of immediately joining the new order. Marshal Pétain's attitude is unclear, but it is generally believed that he will be more compliant than before, as Hitler has allowed France to retain almost all of its territory. The same sources say that Germany is, in reality, currently attempting to establish a "European Federation." (International News, 24th)

London: General de Gaulle stated in a broadcast on BBC today that as a result of the intrusion of German forces, the danger to French African colonies is increasing daily. The real danger at present is not a direct attack by Germany and Italy, but rather internal disintegration. (Reuters, 24th)

Vichy: After Vice-Premier and Minister of the Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Navy Admiral Darlan departed for Paris today, officials here stated that the French cabinet, even if it intends to partially reorganize, will not do so before Vice-Premier Darlan returns to the capital. For this reason, the circumstances of Darlan's meeting with key figures in occupied France in the coming days are noteworthy. Moreover, Darlan's trip to Paris will take longer than expected, likely not returning to the capital until the 27th of this month, and he will also inspect various provinces in the occupied zone. (Havas, 23rd)

Soulek: The New Soulek Daily reports that if the French leader Pétain does not recall Laval into the government, the non-occupied zone of France may face the same fate as the southern country. It is rumored in Vichy that Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer agrees with the German request to pass through Spain, but the French side is still hesitating. (Reuters, 24th)

Berlin: The rumor that the Führer's party representative, Hess, has departed for Spain on official business has been denied by external sources. (Havas, 23rd)

Portuguese Capital: Rumors that the European war will spread to Spain and Portugal have led American expatriates to rush to book passage home. (Havas, 24th)

Algeciras: Gibraltar, a key fortress nearby the border area, continues to construct fortifications and add artillery positions, proving that Britain deeply fears that German and Italian forces may attack the area one day. (Haitong, 24th)

Lisbon: According to a dispatch from Madrid, German diplomatic activities are currently concentrated on Spain, because the German methods of persuading the Spanish government have failed to produce the desired results, and have now reached the stage of threats. Some observers claim that the German intrusion into Spain is so thorough that with a single touch of the trigger, the entire administrative machinery can be transformed into a Teutonic system. It is heard that the German pressure on Spain has been significant in the past two weeks. Recently, it was widely rumored that a representative of Hitler has arrived in Madrid, carrying a firm demand for German passage. It is heard that the Spanish cabinet has extended its meetings. (Reuters, 24th)

### British Mediterranean Fleet Bombards Tripoli; 500 Tons of Shells Fired, Causing Significant Damage; British Forces in Libya Launch Offensive

London: Reuters' correspondent with the British Mediterranean Fleet flagship reports that British Mediterranean Fleet battleships and light cruisers recently bombarded the key port of Tripoli in Italian North Africa for fifty minutes, firing a total of 553 tons of shells, the most intense shelling since the start of the war. Aerial reconnaissance confirmed that a destroyer berth in the port was hit, with one destroyer severely damaged. Five merchant ships were burned or sunk, and at least four others were also hit and caught fire. One of the main targets of the bombardment was the port's wharf, which was simultaneously bombarded by fifteen-inch guns, followed by light cruisers bombarding it for ten minutes. Warehouses in the port were destroyed, and the power plant, railway station, and army storage depots were hit and damaged. Another building, thought to be the Italian military headquarters, also collapsed. Subsequently, an oil depot was hit and burst into flames. In addition, in the five days since the British fleet entered the sea, naval aviation shot down two enemy reconnaissance planes and four German transport planes, and shot down one German seaplane. The British side only lost one fighter plane, with no other casualties or damage. (Reuters, 24th)

Cairo: British forces have now taken the initiative in the Tobruk and Sollum areas of Libya, launching offensive operations. Sources here consider the British attack on Tobruk on Monday night extremely satisfactory, showing that the British garrison there is by no means only engaged in defense. After the British attack, 400 enemy soldiers were captured. While being escorted into Tobruk, they were met with enemy bombing. British forces in Tobruk have launched repeated attacks, and have now captured 1,500 enemy soldiers, many of whom are Italian. (Reuters, 24th)

Cairo: According to news from Addis Ababa (i.e., the capital), preparations are now being made to welcome Haile Selassie back to his homeland. (United Press, 24th)

Cairo: According to a communique from British headquarters this afternoon, in Abyssinia, British forces are still maintaining pressure on the enemy holding defensive positions north of Dessie, but British advances are being hampered by extensive destruction along the way. At the same time, the various British forces operating in the Gambela area have made satisfactory progress. The town of Maji has been occupied by British forces. (Reuters, 24th)

### Chatfield Delivers Broadcast Speech: British Navy's Responsibility is Great

London: Admiral Chatfield delivered a broadcast speech yesterday on Saint George's Day, blaming the previous government for neglecting to rebuild the British Navy. It is said that the British fleet's responsibility today is extremely great. If Britain had not dawdled in peacetime and had quickly rebuilt its navy, then many sailors' lives and tens of millions of tons of critical cargo would have been saved and not lost. He also said that in the past, small groups of British soldiers had changed world history, and British sailors on small ships had driven large enemy fleets out of the sea. Now, the enemy has been shocked to discover that the fighting effectiveness of British youth is no less than that of Germans. As for the Italians, they are not worth mentioning, because they have never had such superior fighting effectiveness. This decisive battle will make this generation of Britons unforgettable to posterity. What we have done before, we can do again now. Victory will surely belong to us. (Reuters, 24th)

As for Papen's current location in Germany and the relationship between Germany and Turkey, external sources refuse to announce anything. (Haitong, 24th)

European War - Discussion (47)

### The Whole Story of Wilkie's Trip to England

Wendell Wilkie, the unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate, visited England and returned home. One morning at 8:05, while the chill of winter had not yet abated, a Dixie aircraft flashed in the dawn above the LaGuardia Airport in the suburbs of New York, circling before landing on the undulating water surface. This distinguished guest, returning from his distant travels, was mentally exhausted and disheveled. He busied himself greeting the photographers, asking after his son, kissing his wife, and saying, "It's so good to be home!"

This extraordinary trip of his is rare in American history. There are only two comparable precedents: one is President Wilson's trip to the Paris Peace Conference, and the other is President Theodore Roosevelt's trip to Europe after leaving office. While both of these trips deeply impressed the name of the United States on the minds of tens of millions of Europeans, Wilkie's trip is different in that he, as a private citizen, traveled at his own expense, going in and out of the British Isles, which were surrounded by the enemy. Eighteen days ago, when he set off from the United States, newspapers were loudly reporting the news of the British forces in Africa capturing Tobruk and the Romanian riots. When he returned from his travels, the British Navy was attacking Genoa, and the British Army had already occupied Benghazi. When he left, the debate over the American Lend-Lease Act was intensifying, and due to his support for the bill, there were rumors that he would be rejected by the Republican Party. By the time he returned, the Lend-Lease Act had passed in the House of Representatives, and the entire country was eagerly awaiting his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

He traveled 14,000 miles. He spoke with four prime ministers, twelve cabinet members, one king, one African chieftain on his way home, one archbishop, the mayors of Liverpool, Bristol, Birmingham, Sheffield, and countless others, such as soldiers, police, laborers, dockworkers, maids, bricklayers, chemists, reporters, and shopkeepers. He saw a Communist demonstration and listened quietly to the debates in the British House of Commons while bombs were raining down outside. He had long talks with workers who maintained London's sewers, and he also negotiated with Churchill, Eden, Pifflebrook, and Attlee until 2:00 AM the next morning.

He went in and out of air-raid shelters, hospitals, aircraft factories, chemical plants, and pubs (to buy beer for the troops). On the eve of his return home, he suddenly flew to Dublin, the capital of Southern Ireland, and dined with Southern Irish Prime Minister Eamon de Valera and his cabinet members. He also sent a message to the Germans, claiming to be an American of Germanic descent, but he opposed all of Hitler's actions. Wherever he went, he was warmly welcomed. The London Times said that wherever he went, whoever he met, he left an impression of sincerity, kindness, energy, and vigor, inspiring people. Even an old woman in the countryside said, "Young man, your face is so cheerful!"

After returning from England, he spoke cautiously, choosing his words carefully. He said that he did not see any signs of defeatism in England, and said; "The free people of the United States, unlike the people of England, who cannot sleep peacefully at night, fearing what the next day might bring, should thank God." As for aid to England, his firm attitude remained unchanged from when he left the United States. He said, "Those who oppose aid to England say that aiding England carries the risk of being drawn into the war, while not aiding England allows us to enjoy the pleasures of peace. These are both unrealistic. In fact, by aiding England, we may be able to avoid war, while not aiding England carries the risk of being drawn into war."

Wilkie's eighteen-day trip to England has made England feel the reality of the United States. After returning home, he made the United States feel the personal interests at stake in the war.

Wilkie's testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was like a scene from a Shakespearean play. The room was crowded, and everyone was whispering and restless. They leaned against the marble walls, surrounding the pillars in the room. Those in the back strained to see the front through the gaps in people's heads. Although the room was large, the light was insufficient, and the walls were full of 18th-century carvings and decorations. It was originally only able to accommodate five hundred people, but now it was crowded with twelve hundred.

The person whose words and demeanor they were eager to see was Wilkie, who had just returned from England. Wilkie, in his middle age, just one week short of his forty-ninth birthday, was amiable, and at this time, as the loser of the presidential election, faced the sharp-eyed committee members. Wilkie had warned the nation against a third term for a president, and against concentrating the great powers granted to the president by the Lend-Lease Act in one person. He had suffered a defeat. If the Republican politicians who opposed the Lend-Lease Act rejected his leadership, he might suffer another defeat, or even fall into a slump. (To be continued)

### Wartime London Nightlife: Prostitutes Still Fill the Streets; Juvenile Delinquency Becomes a Serious Problem

London: Wartime London streets are still filled with prostitutes, but they have changed their hours of operation. They now begin to appear at dusk, because if they wait any later, residents may close their doors due to air raids. Sometimes, around noon, they can also be seen on the streets near Piccadilly. Their clothing has also changed. Most now wear leather jackets that are not outwardly luxurious, but ordinary luxurious clothing is replaced by sweaters and loose clothing. Due to the lack of silk stockings, they, like other women, are fond of wearing short skirts and showing their legs. Their standard equipment is a flashlight, and those who roam farther afield have a steel helmet. The theater district's back streets have been reduced by the war, reducing their presence. Three of the streets where they used to be most prevalent have been destroyed by bombs, so they have also moved elsewhere to make a living. There are currently two changes in London society that are noticeable to tourists: the first is that the English have reversed their traditional silence, and the second is the problem of juvenile delinquency. The constant threat of darkness and death has made the English more friendly to chance acquaintances and less suspicious of strangers, and they are not afraid of talking to bad people while waiting for the bus on dark streets. This is partly because companionship is a comfort during air raids, and partly because of the need for public cooperation, as indicated by air-raid shelters. This change can be noticed when you start paying attention to London's nightlife. Sometimes there are five or six people waiting for a cab outside a hotel. Everyone calls out in the dark. When a cab finally arrives (because the lack of gasoline has greatly reduced the number of vehicles), those going in the same direction will agree to share a cab. If an air raid happens to occur, they will become old friends and invite each other to dine at a "Jug Club." The environment of a "Jug Club" is similar to that of a "speakeasy" during the American Prohibition era, but what destroys their doors are bombs rather than search parties. When their doors are destroyed, the customers help each other pick up the pieces, just like the customers of a "speakeasy" help destroy evidence. In the dance floor of a "Jug Club," there are many men and women in uniform, but the only war-related phenomenon is that women wearing simple clothes are no longer ashamed of having patches on their stockings. Being able to wear silk stockings is considered lucky. These places are named "Jug Clubs" in order to escape the law prohibiting the sale of alcohol after midnight by claiming that the customers are club members. The club purchases various fine wines for the members and writes the members' names on the bottles so that the members can drink them after midnight. The government is very concerned about the problem of juveniles and has repeatedly decided to conduct investigations to determine the impact of crowded air-raid shelters, the lack of proper parental care, and the "live for today" atmosphere of the war on school-age children. Opinions on the actual impact of the war on children in dangerous areas are quite divided. The Mental Health Emergency Committee, which investigated air-raid shelters, reported that children were in good condition during air raids. A spokesperson for the committee explained that many children are mentally unsound due to the general insecurity of life, but the general impact of bombs on children is less than expected. The impact of bombs on children is not as great as the disruption of children's normal daily lives. But the most disturbing effect is the increase in crimes committed by children in their teens. The government is now seeking ways to eliminate this trend. It is said that this trend is partly due to the irregular nature of classes. For example, the London police report that there has been a sharp increase in crimes committed by children aged fourteen or fifteen, while officials in Southampton say that children commit 30% of burglaries of houses or shops. Officials in many other areas estimate that juvenile delinquency has tripled. A social worker in London said, "There are so many juvenile delinquency cases now that it is no longer just a social problem, but a problem of juvenile mental illness. Many situations require psychological treatment. Many children, if not treated, will soon be unable to develop mentally and emotionally. We are now threatened by spiritual rickets."

### Lone Army Camp Four Traitorous Soldiers Assassinate Colonel Xie Jinyuan; All Sectors of Shanghai Mourn Upon Hearing the News; Deputy Commander Wounded, Four Traitorous Soldiers Arrested; Xie's Remains to be Prepared for Burial This Morning at the Lone Army Camp

A shocking assassination occurred in this city yesterday morning at 5:55 AM. The victim was Colonel Xie Jinyuan, former commander of the 88th Division, famous worldwide for his heroic defense of the Sihang Warehouse during the August 13th Shanghai Battle. At the time, Colonel Xie was leading his entire regiment in morning exercises at the Lone Army Camp on Jiaozhou Road. Suddenly, four soldiers from the regiment, rebelling against their superiors, surrounded Colonel Xie, violently attacked him, and repeatedly stabbed him with daggers. Xie, caught off guard and wounded in vital areas, died. At that time, Deputy Commander Shangguan Zhibiao, while chasing the assailants, was also stabbed and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The four assailants have all been arrested and detained at the Gordon Road Police Station, scheduled to be brought to the First Special Court for trial this morning. Whether there is a background to this case is not yet clear, but all Chinese and foreign parties, knowing that Colonel Xie was loyal to the country and unwavering in his convictions, are mourning his sudden and untimely death and expressing concern about this case. The details are recorded below:

Traitorous Soldiers Assassinate, Victim Dies on the Spot

The Lone Army Camp holds a daily morning flag-raising ceremony and exercises. Yesterday morning at 5:55 AM, more than 300 officers and soldiers were lined up in columns on the drill field. As Colonel Xie was calling roll, he noticed that four soldiers were absent. Their names were Zhang Guoshun (Senior Private), Hao Jingcheng (Private), Zhang Wenqing (Private), and You Yaoliang (Private). He immediately ordered the entire unit to run around the track and sent a soldier to the dormitory to order the four to the drill field. When the four arrived at the drill field and met Colonel Xie, Xie reprimanded them for their lack of discipline. Unexpectedly, one of them suddenly pulled out a dagger (or a small foreign knife) about half a foot long from his pocket and rushed forward, stabbing Colonel Xie in the head and chest. The other three also rushed forward, helping the assailant and knocking him to the ground. Xie sustained serious injuries and died on the spot.

Deputy Commander Wounded, Assailants Captured

The entire unit, which was running at the time, was shocked by this tragedy. They immediately stopped, and Deputy Commander Shangguan Zhibiao (30 years old, from Fujian), leading the unit, chased after the assailants. The assailants wielded their knives and resisted arrest. Shangguan Zhibiao was the first to be attacked and was stabbed unconscious. However, the assailants eventually had nowhere to escape and surrendered. The entire unit handed them over to the White Russian International Settlement Guard stationed at the camp. An ambulance was immediately called to take the wounded Deputy Commander Shangguan Zhibiao to Renji Hospital for treatment. The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department was also called to send police cars to transport the four assailants to the Central Police Station. The Lone Army Camp was immediately placed under strict guard. Except for those with special passes issued by the Police Department, all outside personnel were strictly prohibited from entering, and telephone communications were cut off. The iron mesh at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road was increased from two to four, and eight police officers guarded the area under strict vigilance.

Xie's Remains to be Prepared for Burial This Morning

Because the Lone Army Camp was strictly sealed off, reporters were unable to enter yesterday, so the details could not be ascertained. However, according to a camp orderly who went out to shop, Colonel Xie's remains have been moved from the drill field to his private bedroom. The entire unit mourned and paid their respects before the bed and immediately appointed an officer to be responsible for camp affairs. The burial is scheduled for 11:00 AM this morning at the camp. After the wounded Deputy Commander Shangguan Zhibiao was taken to Renji Hospital, he was bandaged and treated by doctors. He sustained knife wounds to the left forehead, left shoulder, and flank, as well as two wounds to the waist. Although he lost a lot of blood, fortunately, none of the wounds were to vital areas, and there is no danger to his life. When a reporter visited him at the hospital yesterday, he said that Xie was attacked by absent soldiers when he (Shangguan) was leading the run and had not noticed it. When he found out, he went to chase them and was stabbed unconscious. He knew nothing about what happened after that. As for the motives of the assailants, he said that he had not heard anything beforehand.

Motives for the Attack Unclear

Since leading his troops into the public concession and being confined to the Lone Army Camp on Jiaozhou Road, Xie had worked hard to improve the situation, personally drafting plans for education, sports, and production, and actively training his troops so that they could still serve the country in the future. He worked diligently day and night, no different from when he was participating in the war. For more than three years, the physical and intellectual abilities of his subordinates have made significant progress, especially in the production of soap, socks, and other items, which have achieved remarkable results. He had donated thousands of dollars in proceeds to the government, which was highly commended by the authorities. Although Xie's freedom of movement was restricted and the environment was deteriorating, causing him mental distress, he remained steadfast in his convictions, often encouraging his subordinates by saying that they should endure hardship and wait for the light to come. His subordinates also deeply understood his intentions and supported him, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates was not bad. Unexpectedly, he was killed by his subordinates, so all parties are suspicious of the motives of the assailants.

SMC's Public Statement

According to a public statement issued by the SMC last night, this (24th) morning, while the Lone Army Camp on Jiaozhou Road was lining up, Colonel Xie Jinyuan and one of the deputy commanders were suddenly attacked by some soldiers in the camp. As a result, Colonel Xie was stabbed and seriously wounded, and died. At the same time, the deputy commander was also seriously injured and has been transferred to the hospital. The four soldiers responsible for the case were arrested on the spot and handed over to the camp guards for transfer to the police station for detention. According to the four soldiers arrested, the oppressive behavior of the two leaders was the cause of the incident. The case is under investigation.

An Elderly Father Above, Orphans and a Widow Below

It is reported that Colonel Xie Jinyuan was 37 years old this year, a native of Jiaoling, Guangdong, and a graduate of the fourth class of Whampoa Military Academy. He left behind an elderly father, a widow, and four children, whose family members now live in his hometown. His kind mother passed away in April of last year. Who would have thought that a year later, he would follow her to the grave? How tragic!

### "Quitting"

A problem worth studying.

The threat to life is already terrible, and the threat of opium to the mind is even more terrifying. May I ask how much money you have spent in the past?

How much pain are you suffering now?

In the future, do you still want light?

Indecisiveness and lack of determination to quit are the sins of smokers.

Perfunctory quitting and incomplete removal are the sins of those who help quit.

In this era, we are threatened by the turmoil of the European continent and the difficult living environment. If we add the constraints and consumption of opium, or inject morphine, we will not only sacrifice personal happiness but also destroy the happiness of our families. Therefore, to use such drugs at this time is to destroy everything. So, everyone recognizes that smokers today have only one way to quit. Indeed, smokers today, even though they have reached the end, can still quit smoking comfortably. If you don't quit today, when you want to quit but can't, the danger and pain of regret will be unimaginable.

Today, Yunnan and Sichuan soil [opium] are cut off, and the authorities have strictly prohibited planting. Therefore, most of the opium sold on the market is mixed with various potent drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and strychnine. Therefore, after smoking, there will be dizziness, chest tightness, palpitations, loss of appetite, thirst, shortness of breath, reduced sleep, sore limbs, gray-black complexion, and itchy red spots on the skin. Also, when smoking, the smell is fierce, but even if you smoke freely, you cannot boost your spirits, and it disappears in an instant. Therefore, smokers pay such a high price to smoke this kind of inferior soil, which is a true embodiment of the ancient proverb "drinking poison to quench thirst."

Smokers today, indeed, no one doesn't want to quit, but they all take the word "quit" too lightly. Those with clearer minds believe that as long as they have a firm will, they can quit. In fact, even if the will is firm, if the method of quitting is not good, it is still inevitable that they will give up halfway and create a fear of quitting. Therefore, to achieve the purpose of quitting, the engineers who help quit must have precise knowledge, rich experience, and formulate valuable drugs, and take full responsibility to ensure that the person quitting feels no pain and has an extreme aversion to drugs. With such a method of quitting, there is no worry that they cannot permanently leave the sea of suffering and enjoy the happiness of life again. Therefore, for the word "quit," families should put words into action. Once you quit, you must quit completely. And to quit thoroughly, you must carefully choose a doctor. Do not be confused by propaganda, greedy for cheap prices, and casually quit, making your body a human experiment. As a result, your health suffers, you lose money, and you remain mired in the sea of suffering. The return of spring is the most appropriate time for smokers to quit. Dr. Lai Gongliang has more than ten years of experience in quitting smoking, and he deeply understands the psychological and pathological conditions of smokers when quitting. He uses safe and appropriate methods and is responsible for clearing up the poison and promoting health. In the process of quitting smoking, there is absolutely no pain, and you can leave the sea of suffering without realizing it. This is because Dr. Lai's method of quitting smoking does not use injections (because injections often have many drawbacks) and does not advocate hospitalization (because hospitalization implies coercion). Therefore, Dr. Lai's four characteristics of quitting smoking—increased appetite, stable sleep, smooth bowel movements, and physical and mental comfort—have become ironclad facts. Those who are determined to quit smoking can ask for medicine. If you are satisfied after taking it for two days, try the formal quitting process.

### Coolidge Liner Sails for the U.S. Tonight; American Evacuation Continues; More than 200 Americans Return on the Ship

The American Mail Line giant liner President Coolidge arrived in Shanghai at 2:45 PM yesterday after passing through Manila and Hong Kong, berthing at buoys 11 and 12. The passenger launch arrived at the Custom House Pier at 3:45 PM. In addition to carrying 126 large bags of mail, the ship also carried 742 passengers, of whom 157 disembarked here.

The rest will continue on to the United States on the same ship. The ship will stay here overnight and is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 8:30 PM tonight, passing through Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and other places before returning to San Francisco and Los Angeles, and then connecting to New York. The last two ferries will depart from the Custom House Pier at 5:15 PM and 7:15 PM this afternoon to the big ship. More than 200 American women, children, and "non-essential" men from this port will return to the United States on this ship. Also, in order to expand its shipping services, the American Mail Line plans to return to the two-way service of its ships operating in the Far East, meaning the vessels will stop in Shanghai twice, once when traveling from the United States to the Philippines, and again when traveling from the Philippines back to the United States. This method will be implemented starting with the Taft liner, which will pass through Shanghai from the United States to the Philippines on the 8th of next month, and then pass through Shanghai from the Philippines back to the United States on the 21st of next month. The other ships will also take the same route.

### Former Chairman of the SMC, Kees van Willigen, Leaves Shanghai This Morning

Mr. van Willigen plans to stay in America for a while before going to England. His colleagues at the SMC and Jardine Matheson & Co. have presented him with commemorative items such as silver boxes and cigarette boxes to express their gratitude. All his friends and the SMC honor guard will be there to see him off.

### Nanshi Iron Gates Opened Yesterday Morning

The five iron gates of Nanshi connected to the French Concession (Sixteen Pups, Xin Kaihe, Xin Qiao Jie, Nanyang Bridge Xieqiao) which had been closed, have been reopened, because as many as 25 prisoners escaped. Therefore, the Japanese side implemented emergency security measures from the morning of the 22nd, preventing residents of Nanshi from going to the concession, and arresting residents with shaved heads everywhere, resulting in many rumors from the outside world. The Nanshi market suddenly became deserted. Until about 11:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese side cancelled this measure. Although there was a lively scene of citizens entering and leaving, the Japanese army at the iron gate still conducted extremely harsh searches of pedestrians. As for the wharves along the shore leading to Nanshi, they were also opened at the same time yesterday.

### After Italy Seizes Southern Ship, Britain May Retaliate; Response Steps Still Under Careful Study; Port Authorities Have Lodged a Strong Protest

After the Yugoslav cargo ship Tomislav, moored at buoys 12 and 13 of the Huangpu River, was seized by the Italian Marines stationed in Shanghai this past Tuesday, it was still guarded by Italian troops yesterday (the 24th). It is expected that the British authorities here may take retaliatory measures and seize the Italian ship Conte Verde, which has been docked in the Huangpu River since June of last year, but the British authorities have not taken any action.

British Side Considers Appropriate Steps

British Consul-General George told reporters yesterday morning that the whole matter is still under consideration and that the British authorities have not yet lodged a protest. George declined to say what action the British side would take, only saying that the matter must be properly studied before any response steps can be taken. Also, Italian officials here stated yesterday morning that the Italian troops boarded the Tomislav at the request of the "Southern Authorities" as a "protective measure." When asked who the "Southern Authorities" requesting protection were, the official replied that this could not be disclosed. It is reported that Shanghai has always been considered a neutral port, and the Italian authorities' seizure of the Tomislav is unprecedented in Shanghai.

Crew Mutinies, Ships Sails to Shanghai for Resolution

The North China Daily News reported that the British-chartered Yugoslav cargo ship Tomislav, traveling between Australia and Dagukou, carrying wheat, sailed into Shanghai on Thursday afternoon due to a mutiny by some of the crew, and temporarily docked in the Huangpu River for a resolution. On Tuesday afternoon at 2:45, the ship was seized by a team of Italian Marines dispatched by the Italian gunboat Lepanto. After the ship arrived in Shanghai on Thursday afternoon, the captain visited the British shipping authorities in this city to explain the difficulties. The British authorities told him that he could dismiss the mutinous crew members and find other crew members to replace them. Subsequently, several senior crew members of the ship, all Croats who were sympathetic to Italy, refused to sail the ship out under British charter and went to the Italian Consulate in Shanghai to complain.

Political Oppression, Captain Helpless

The Italian Consulate sent an advisor to the Tomislav to tell the captain that they knew where the captain's wife and children and relatives lived in the Southern country. If he sailed the ship out under British charter, the Italian side would retaliate against his wife and children. After being intimidated, the captain was unwilling to raise anchor and sail out. British naval officers stationed in Shanghai learned of this and went to the Tomislav to discuss the matter, but no resolution was reached, as the crew said they intended to stay in Shanghai to await the end of the war.

Port Authorities Lodge Strong Protest

A few hours later, twelve Italian Marines, led by an officer, transferred to the Tomislav on a motorboat and placed it under guard. Yesterday (the 23rd) morning, members of the Customs Water Police Force sent personnel to board the ship to inquire about the situation, but they were blocked by several Italian soldiers armed with machine guns and were forced to retreat. Since the first team of Italian troops boarded the Tomislav, other Italian troops have boarded the ship to reinforce their forces, keeping watch all night. It is reported that the port authorities have lodged a strong protest against the Italian side's seizure of the ship. The Tomislav is now berthed on a buoy opposite the waterworks, very close to where the Italian ship Conte Verde is moored.

### Commercial Dispute Begins Mediation, Awaiting Hong Kong Telegram

Since all the staff of the Commercial Press left the office late on the 22nd, the company has remained closed on the following morning, creating a deadlock. Lu Gaoyi, the manager of the World Book Company, could not bear to see the labor-management dispute of China's largest cultural organization go to extremes, so he voluntarily stepped forward to mediate. First, he expressed his opinions to Li Bake, the Shanghai manager representing the management, who agreed. Then, he expressed his position to the person in charge on the labor side, and the labor side also accepted. Since both labor and management were willing to agree to mediation, Lu immediately contacted Miss Hinden of the SMC and jointly telegraphed General Manager Wang in Hong Kong, asking him to authorize the person in charge in Shanghai to handle the matter with full authority, so that it could be negotiated based on the conditions proposed by the labor side. It is reported that this telegram was sent out at 11:00 AM yesterday. At the same time, Manager Li of the Shanghai authorities also telegraphed Hong Kong to seek advice. If General Manager Wang could grant the request, the labor unrest might take a sharp turn and be calmed down as soon as possible. The labor side has always had a good relationship with Li, and is also willing to negotiate.

Factory Lockdown

Yesterday, all factory workplaces were locked down as usual. All workers elected five representatives to petition the Industrial Section of the SMC for mediation, and proposed five conditions: 1. Increase salaries according to the minimum living expenses of 125 yuan published by the SMC; 2. Immediately pay back wages owed after August 13th; 3. Before the living conditions of colleagues in Shanghai are improved, they must not be transferred to the interior; 4. Abolish the contract and do not dismiss employees without cause; 5. Wages will be paid as usual during the shutdown.

Miss Hinden's Remarks

Director Miss Hinden received the delegation and inquired in detail, and instructed them that the colleagues of the publishing and distribution department have also applied for mediation, and it is proposed to jointly mediate with Mr. Lu Gaoyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Publishing Industry Association. A telegram has been urgently sent to General Manager Wang Yunwu in Hong Kong to discuss the conditions for mediation, and he hopes to wait patiently for a solution and not cause any disturbance.

### Bookstore Clarifies the Truth about the Circulation of a Fake Booklet

Recently, people from all walks of life in this city have received a booklet titled "The Sins of the Red Bandits" mailed by someone who forged the covers of various newspapers. Pingming Press believes that the inside story of this matter is complicated, so we specially visited the press's Shanghai office yesterday. According to the person in charge, the booklet was originally commissioned by the Nanchang Military Headquarters in February of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935) to be published and distributed by the press and was included in the "Applicable Books for Security Teams and Strong Men Training in Various Provinces." The copyright did not belong to the press. The press was only ordered to publish and distribute it. Later, the military headquarters did not add to the print run, and the press stopped publishing it. Therefore, the book has not been reprinted since March of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936). Also, the book has been removed from the latest book catalog compiled and printed by the press. It is now found that the recently discovered distribution copies are all reprints. For example, the printing press listed is incorrect. Since the 25th year of the Republic of China, the press's printing press has not been on Jing'an Temple Road. The current reprint still states that it was printed by the press's Jing'an Temple Road printing press, which is obviously fictitious, and the printing quality is very poor, unlike the books printed by the press. When asked if the press was still selling this book, it was said that this book had been discontinued and was no longer sold after the printing stopped in March of the 25th year of the Republic of China. Our reporter also asked how the press would deal with the circulation of this reprint. They said that since the copyright of this book does not belong to the press, it cannot make a protest on behalf of the copyright owner regarding the reprinting. Fortunately, people with discerning eyes can understand everything, so the press does not want to say too much.

### The Joint Office of the China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks Has Not Been Established; Resumption of Business Still in Progress

Yesterday, the English-language "Times" reported that the four banks, China, Central, Communications, and Farmers, would establish a joint office to continue operations, located in a new building west of Tongfu Road on Jing'an Temple Road. After inquiring from all parties, the issue of the four banks resuming business is being discussed with all parties. As soon as the staff can feel at ease to serve and customers can come to the bank without danger, business will resume as before. The rumor about a joint office has no basis, and it is said that the building is currently equipped with various protective devices to defend against terrorist actions, which is also unfounded.

### Dark Market Surcharges Disrupt Business; Rice Merchants Stop Entering the Market; Hong Kong and Shanghai Cooperate to Supply Shanghai Residents with Food; Another 5,000 Tons Will Be Sold at Low Prices

According to a statement issued by the Public Works Department, the Bureau is in final negotiations with the Hong Kong Rice and Grain Administrator.  Barring unforeseen or uncontrollable circumstances, the Bureau will be able to obtain a normal and sufficient supply of rice to sell on the market, which will be sufficient to solve the city's rice supply problem.  At the same time, a decision has been made to sell this rice to the public at the lowest possible price.  The Bureau is currently in consultation on how to do this.

The Bureau has also secured priority access to 5,000 tons of rice (i.e., 50,000 bags). This quantity can now be sold to rice merchants affiliated with the Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, but with the stipulation that this rice must be sold to the "Seven Seas" populace at a price far below the market price.

Notice to the Industry: Ordering Hong Kong Rice

In order to actively proceed with purchasing the large quantity of special small "Ying Guang" rice supplied by the Hong Kong government, various rice industry associations convened a joint meeting on the afternoon of the day before yesterday.  Following the deliberations, it was decided that a public notice would be posted to the market soon to solicit opinions from the industry and strongly encourage subscriptions. This notice was posted yesterday separately at the rice market and the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil, and Cake Exchange so that everyone would be informed.  Anyone wishing to participate in the subscription must submit a written report of the quantity they wish to purchase to the two rice industry associations in the city by the 25th of this month for compilation.

Rice Merchants' Business: No Market Entry Yesterday

Yesterday, the rice market was affected by the decision of rice merchants throughout the city on the day before yesterday to refuse to purchase rice with surcharges.  As a result, most rice merchants did not go to the market to do business.  A few who did go to the market waited downstairs for news.  All two hundred or so crude rice brokers in the market also voluntarily stopped entering the market for three days starting yesterday, causing business in the market to come to a complete standstill.  The Rice Merchants Association is both urging its members not to participate in black market transactions in order to discourage speculative trading and earnestly requesting that the concession authorities promptly find a way to order hoarding households to sell their stored rice at the limited price for resale by rice merchants. The text of their announcement is as follows: "Regarding the matter of the notice: Since the authorities restricted rice prices on the 17th of this month, dark market price surcharges have reappeared in the rice market, and prices have soared daily, becoming very rampant. Therefore, we specially and earnestly notify all rice merchants in our industry to abide by the limited prices and not to purchase goods beyond the limit, which would violate the law. This is of utmost importance."

Hong Kong and Shanghai Cooperate: Source Assured

Although rice merchants and brokers have stopped entering the market to do business, general hoarding households still intend to hold onto prices and are unwilling to sell at the limited price. However, this stalemate will not last long, because legitimate rice merchants, after the concession authorities and Hong Kong contact group purchases, will soon stabilize the rice market in this port, making it impossible for speculators to manipulate it, and rice prices can also fall. General hoarding households, if they do not take the opportunity to sell at the limited price as soon as possible, will suffer a major blow. According to investigators, Hong Kong currently has a total of more than one million bags of rice in storage. According to Hong Kong authorities' regular reserve of 500,000 bags of rice, the amount to be shipped to Shanghai is very large. Moreover, since Hong Kong is a rice transshipment hub and is now cooperating closely with this city, there is no need to worry about the source of rice needed in this city in the future.

Reserves Increase to Two Million Bags

According to yesterday's survey, the total amount of rice stored in warehouses in the two concessions and Pudong Hongkou was 1.2 million bags, an increase of 150,000 bags compared to last week. The amount stored in the warehouses of Japanese companies such as Huishan Hongsheng, as well as various manufacturers and rice merchants throughout the city, is also around 700,000 bags, which has not yet been calculated. Therefore, the amount of rice stored in this city is close to 2 million bags, which is enough to meet the needs of the city's residents for seven months, and the source is very smooth.

Public Warehouse Rice Funds

The Rice Public Warehouse Management Committee reported at a meeting the day before yesterday the number of collections up to April 22: (A) Rice funds received by the warehouse totaled 6,873,350 yuan, with the hardware industry still owing 2,550 yuan, the yarn factory industry (Datong and Qinfeng) 23,000 yuan, and the bean and rice industry 1,226,975 yuan.

Association Sets Rice

The Food Cooperative Association ordered 1,000 bags of Saigon broken rice from Daifu Foreign Company at 181 Jiujiang Road on the 18th of this month, at a price of 261 Vietnamese currency per ton and 116 legal currency per bag. They will be loaded on the Huo Feilun in Vietnam around May 15 and shipped to Shanghai. This is the fifth rice determined by the association, which will be distributed to the association's designated households numbered 486 to 746 (designated from February 21 to March 4). The purchase determined this time is broken rice. If the designated households do not wish to purchase broken rice, they must send a letter of declaration before the 29th of this month.

### Yesterday Evening on Avenue Albert: Assassination Case; Jiang Zhaoxiang Shot and Killed

### Pinzhen Pearl Jewelry Store Robbed in Broad Daylight

At 12:45 yesterday noon, the Pinzhen Pearl Jewelry Store at the entrance of Daqing Lane on Nanjing Road was suddenly invaded by five robbers. Two robbers with guns entered the store, and three robbers stood guard. After the two robbers who entered the store threatened the staff, they smashed the glass counters in the store and stole a large number of diamond ornaments, worth about 50,000 yuan. They rushed out of the store and, together with the robbers on guard, fled in different directions without a trace. After receiving the news, the police immediately dispatched a large team of Chinese and Western detectives and police cars to hunt them down, but the robbers had already escaped far away.

### Anhua Sock Factory Owner Splattered with Feces

There are more than a dozen sock factories in this city. The factory owners held a dinner party at the Southeast Hongqing Restaurant on Guangdong Road the night before last (the 23rd). It was not until after 10:00 that the party broke up. Wang Liwei, the owner of the Anhua factory, and his wife walked out of the restaurant and reached the corner of Fuzhou Road when a man suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and threw a paper package at Wang's face. Unexpectedly, the package was full of feces, causing Wang to be covered in it and reeking with stench. The man, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled without a trace.

### Addicted to Gambling and Flower Associations, Goes Crazy, Sent to Shanghai Mental Hospital for Treatment

Recently, society has been restless, and gambling is rampant. The flower association is the most harmful, and there have been many cases of death as a result. Yesterday, a local woman, Zhang Jinshi, 23 years old, lived at 13 Rongjiazhai, Pingliang Road, Hongkou. She loved playing flower associations as if it were her life. Recently, she lost more than 200 yuan in succession and was afraid of being humiliated by her husband, so she suddenly went crazy and wandered around Qiwupu Road, scolding passersby. Nearby police questioned her, but she was still talking nonsense. Knowing that she was having a nervous breakdown, they detained her at the Yangshupu Police Station and transferred her to the Shanghai Mental Hospital at the west end of Carter Road on Avenue Haig. It is said that after being treated by the hospital's doctors, she had regained some consciousness.

### Food: Rice Weevil Replays Old Tricks; They All Refrain from Entering the Market; Seemingly to Suppress the Dark Market on the Surface; Actually Still Raising Rice Prices

Yesterday, foreign rice was completely stagnant. Brokers did not enter the market, and trading houses did not have formal transactions. In the afternoon, there was also a lack of transactions in the original packaged Yanghua Company rice. However, judging from the trend of the rice market, prices should have fallen yesterday, because the survey of warehouse reserves in the market increased by another 150,000 bags, with the total in various warehouses not less than 1.2 million bags, and goods en route were still arriving one after another, with a very large number being unloaded and waiting to be unloaded. There were also warehouse reserves of rice in Puzuo factories that were not included in the survey, amounting to no less than 600,000 to 700,000. Such a large number would inevitably have an impact on the market. Moreover, the Hong Kong and Myanmar authorities allowed the supply of 100,000 to 250,000 bags of rice per month to Shanghai residents, which is sufficient to meet the city's normal needs. This would further give manipulators a practical blow. Therefore, if there were formal transactions yesterday, the market price would inevitably have shown a downward trend. Although large households can hold on, floating households and those who have made profits will try to get out first. Generally, the markets try to avoid a fall, so they refrain from going to the market. With the market stagnant, there is a lack of supply for market sales, and rice prices are secretly raised. This is one reason. Another reason is to disrupt people's minds. Seeing that the rice market is not selling rice, people will inevitably panic. Therefore, rice tigers and rice weevils, seeing people panic to the extreme, then make the market idle and can raise rice prices as they wish, and can also say that they are maintaining people's food, but actually carry out their cunning schemes. This is the second reason. In the past, rice merchants also stopped operating to observe the situation when rice prices reached the highest new price, fearing that a single breath would send them to the top and inevitably be pointed at by thousands and cursed by tens of thousands, and that it would end without a disease. After the situation passed, floating hoarders, new hoarders, and old hoarders still used their "throwing top palace" skills, and the situation was as rampant as before. Now, seeing that the new limited price is already high and the new surcharge is also high, they are again replaying the old trick of "not entering the market" and "temporarily suspending operations," in order to lure the enemy in deep. This is the third reason. As for general rice stores, because dark market prices have repeatedly soared, making it difficult to cope with retail sales, they have also stopped entering the market to purchase goods. However, the public cannot go a day without buying rice, and rice stores can use the closure of the rice market as a smoke screen to raise prices. This is the fourth reason. In short, this kind of action seems to be mutually restraining, but in fact it is a mutually completing, organized action to further increase rice prices. Therefore, no matter which side the rice merchants are on, they will not lose money. What they are making a fortune on are still the millions of people who are waiting for rice to eat.

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Zhini Canada, a mail ship of the Zhawa Company, transported more than 1,500 bags of foreign rice and 7,000 bags of corn from Hong Kong and docked at Pudong Lanyan Chimney to unload.

### Flour: Active Customer Sales; Large Quantities of Foreign Flour Shipped to Tianjin

Currently, foreign flour transactions are not formally conducted in the miscellaneous grain market, but direct distribution to customers by various trading houses is quite lively. This is because the North China gangs have been continuously seeking to buy and sell, and the demand for Australian flour is even more greedy, so the market is rising and difficult to fall. The inventory of Hua Niao and Dillou brand Australian flour is insufficient, and those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell. The floating chips of Kan flour on the market have also dried up, and everyone is optimistic. The unified market price for Huawu brand is 31.5 to 6 yuan, and the price for Jinlong brand Kan flour is 31 yuan. The company sold 14,000 to 5,000 bags to customers. The Huachang plain selling flour is still supplied at a price of 25 yuan. Wheat supply and demand are both silent, and there is no regular market.

A large quantity of foreign flour is shipped to Tianjin. The Taikoo Company's Yingzhou wheel has 61,000 bags of flour being transported to Tianjin today. The flour is produced in Canada and Australia and is handled by the British-owned Tianxiang Foreign Company in this city. After being transported to Shanghai, it will be transshipped to Tianjin. It is heard that the Hunan wheel, which is exported tomorrow, will also transport 82,000 bags to Tianjin. (Year)

### Opium Poppy

— Gao Jianong

For many years, it has been a great scourge of China, and now there is hope of its disappearance. The flowers are so beautiful, and the sap so intoxicating.

Opium poppy is the name it received after it was introduced to China, and it is also known as Lichun and Minang.

Educational News

### Recent Situation of Vocational Education in Guangxi Province: Chinese Medicine Research Institute Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine Specialties; Agricultural and Industrial Vocational Supplementary Schools Combine Teachers' and Students' Work and Study

(Guilin Correspondence) Chen Yunsheng, Section Chief of the Education Department of the Guangxi Provincial Government, was previously ordered to inspect vocational education in the province. Upon his return, he discussed the results of his inspection as follows:

(1) Medical vocational education, such as the Provincial Wuzhou Medical Research Institute, the Wuzhou Midwifery and Nursing School, and the internships and services of nursing students (士) and midwifery students (士) at the Wuzhou, Liuzhou, and Pingle hospitals, were all inspected. The Chinese Medicine Research Institute aims to study and develop the specialties of traditional Chinese medicine and make them scientific. Therefore, both Chinese and Western medicine practitioners serve as teachers, and teachers and students are very happy to study. However, it is scattered in Hailu Village, making internships and equipment more difficult. A request has been submitted to the provincial government to allow the institute to move back to Wuzhou. The academic system of this type of medical research institute in the province still needs to be improved, and a request has been submitted to the government to coordinate and establish the Guangxi Provincial Chinese Medicine College in the future to concentrate resources and operate it in a sound manner. The students of the midwifery and nursing school are mostly good in their studies and in their midwifery and nursing internships and services in various hospitals. However, there are still a few who do not have a correct understanding of the duties and careers in the province, mistakenly thinking that they are junior doctors, and do not pay attention to their basic duties of nursing in the wards. However, those who can receive strict guidance from the hospital director and head nurse are still very good. The overall improvement of the education of midwifery and nursing schools in the province has also been discussed with professionals with experience, and will be contributed to the government for reference.

(2) Agricultural and industrial vocational education, such as the Cangwu County Women's Vocational Supplementary School, the Liuzhou Shatang Provincial Senior Agricultural Vocational School, the Pingle Elementary Practical Vocational School, and several factories and farms, were all visited. The characteristics of Cangwu Women's Vocational School are that the government lent the school capital of 1,600 yuan in national currency, and teachers and students combine work and study, that is, production and education are integrated. According to various reports, the capital is repaid in two installments, and the products (weaving, sewing, knitting, and towel-making) are in short supply. More and more women are gaining production skills, and their general knowledge is also increasing at the same time. It is a pity that the county government has too little financial resources, otherwise the effect of production and needlework would be even greater. The Shatang Provincial Agricultural School (currently has agricultural and forestry departments and animal husbandry and veterinary departments) is located in the center of a large agricultural experiment field, and the environment is suitable for the growth of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. The equipment for experimentation and research, and the Agricultural College of Guangxi University can be used for assistance, which is a rare combination. Most of the daily life of teachers and students is managed by groups, such as fetching water, chopping wood, purchasing, cooking, washing, feeding, poultry and livestock, as well as farming, building roads, digging ditches, lecturing, researching, writing, and entertainment, all of which are done well. Therefore, they are physically strong and powerful. The teachers and students of Pingle Vocational School, except that they are slightly inferior to the Senior Agricultural School in chopping wood and growing vegetables, can all manage their own lives like the Senior Agricultural School. In addition, the school buildings are scattered among the hills, and they are accustomed to climbing mountains and planting trees. The fabrics and towels produced by the textile department, the pickles and dried meat produced by the agricultural production department, and the vegetable planting and tree planting on barren land by the agronomy department all have excellent results. The school is well-organized, and the local people are very admired. They regard the school as a comprehensive production paradise integrating farms, factories, schools, and parks. According to the opinions of the authorities of the above-mentioned schools, it is believed that every teacher and student of a vocational school must be able to "do, learn, and teach" in order to correct the shortcomings of past vocational school education and create true modern production occupations. After graduation, ordinary and specialized talents must create a model role in the industry, so that national and social production will increase dramatically, and the ethics, knowledge, and technology of production personnel will continue to improve. The products of the textile department of Pingle Vocational School cannot meet the needs of all parties due to capital relations. It is heard that they plan to cooperate with the Provincial Hexian Minsheng Textile Factory to ensure the integration of production and education and the integration of economic construction and cultural construction to achieve great results. The school has been ordered by the Ministry of Education and the Provincial Government to establish a sugar manufacturing department and has designated the Mawi Village cotton field (with an area of ​​150 acres) four miles away from the school as the site, which is excellent in terms of shape and quality. It is now actively looking for specialized personnel to design.

(3) Vocational education in the province is still in its infancy. As mentioned above, most schools focus on "doing" (that is, internships and learning). In every production process, "learning" and "teaching" do not rely on others in daily life, and they already have a good foundation for vocational education. If the government and society add guidance and support in time, under the combination of construction and education, the future of vocational schools in the province will be infinitely optimistic.

Xiu Xue Lecture (Learning and Cultivation Lecture)

### How to Study Physics (3)

— Xu Ziwei

(6) Read more extracurricular reading materials. The knowledge gained from the classroom and textbooks is only a small outline of physics. If you want to expand your knowledge of physics in both the vertical and horizontal directions, then reading more physics reference books outside of class is the only way. However, physics books are as vast as the ocean. Those that are too specialized are too difficult to understand and only increase doubts. Those that are too popular are too superficial and meaningless and only reduce interest. Therefore, it is necessary to choose. You can ask the teacher to give instructions and introduce them according to the level of difficulty. There are two ways to read reference books. Those that are suitable for your level should be read chapter by chapter. As for those that are too complex, they should be used as references for special problems.

(7) Examine the results of the experiment. Experiments can increase the interest in research and assist in the understanding of theories, but they should be carried out in conjunction with teaching. Many physics students regard experiments and textbook teaching as two unrelated things, and they are carried out in an uncoordinated manner. Therefore, the benefits obtained from experiments are very small. We must carefully observe the demonstration experiments in the classroom and refer to the theories being discussed. For automatic physics experiments, before the experiment, we must first read the theories about the experimental materials in the textbook, and then follow the order of the experimental instructions carefully. Record the results obtained at any time and check for errors. If the results are not correct, first find out where the error is, and then repeat the experiment to get accurate results as the result of the experiment.

(8) Remember the main points of the content. Although the physics course in middle school is general physics and is the foundation of physics, the amount of teaching materials is also quite large. We certainly cannot memorize all of it, but we should select the main points of the content and familiarize ourselves with them. Most of the terms in physics are composed of two or three characters, each with its own special meaning. We must clearly understand its definition. If it contains quantitative relationships, we must also familiarize ourselves with its units and calculation formulas. Physical laws are concepts that explain the order of evolution and the truth of physical phenomena under prescribed conditions. We should understand its principles and be able to use them to interpret real-world problems. If it contains quantitative relationships, we must also be familiar with its formulas and the use of calculations. The various physical phenomena discussed in physics all have their own causes and effects of evolution. We should know the process of its evolution and the principles in detail. According to physical machines, they are engineering soldiers created by applying physical principles. We must understand the structure and the principles of its operation. Physical diagrams are hypothetical representations that explain physical theories. We should understand its relationships and methods.

Spring and Autumn (An Essay Section)

### Abandoned Infant

— Yifei

Mother A-Quan hurried out of the factory gate and bought some broken rice to take home. She was worried about her daughter-in-law in bed and her young grandson. Alas, the children must be waiting anxiously. Why is it taking so long? She really doesn't understand herself anymore. With great difficulty, she finally reached the crooked, uneven alley. Suddenly, she stepped on something soft and almost tripped. Looking down, it looked like a small corpse.

"What a sin!" She spat and thought, "Alas! Bad luck. It's true that people are getting old. Even this alley that I've felt my way through for twenty years is hard to walk, and when I was young, I always came back from the factory at seven or eight o'clock, and I still had to buy rice and cook, going in and out. Now it's not even dark yet. Alas! It's true that people are getting old. There's no point in living in this world..."

Thinking, resentfully, she finally reached home. Pushing open the back door, the dark kitchen was silent. The older child came out to greet her:

"Grandma, have you come? Did you buy rice? I'm hungry."

"Ah, my good boy, where's Mommy? Is the little brother crying?" The grandmother revealed her natural love, stroking the child's head.

The cold wind slammed against the door, and it opened with a "ya." The room also lit up. Mother A-Quan was coming in. Her haggard face showed sadness and worry. Mother A-Quan looked at her suspiciously. After a moment, she said:

"Are you buying kerosene? Alas! Such a strong wind, and you've only been 'in bed' for six or seven days. How could you run out! Alas, how is the child?"

"He's asleep," Mother A-Quan said with difficulty. This seemed to sting her heart, but she deliberately diverted the conversation: "How is A-Quan? Is someone with him?"

"Don't worry, his friends are taking good care of him. They say he's much better. He just has a fever..." Mother A-Quan was horrified, as if she had blurted something out, but she repeated herself calmly: "Alas, it's just that we don't have enough money, so we can't..."

"What?"

"What..." Mother A-Quan's tone was slow.

"Tsk tsk, alas! I'm also in confinement and can't work. Otherwise, I could scrape together some money. It's always important to get him medical treatment. It's fierce in the factory now! Women who have given birth don't even get a subsidy, let alone a rest. If you take leave, you have to find a replacement." Mother A-Quan babbled, with emotion and anger. Mother A-Quan hurried out again, as if she remembered her hungry stomach, and started the stove with "crackling" sounds.

The room returned to silence. The children sat huddled like lost lambs. Mother A-Quan fell on the bed, staring blankly at the air! How was she going to say that she had abandoned it? This obstacle to life... She wanted to cry, but then she smiled, as if she already saw her husband's healthy face.

### A Superfluous Act

— Liu Jiagan

The laziest of all creatures is man, and yet the least averse to trouble is also man. It is no exaggeration to say that man is a quagmire of "contradictions"!

Even though something could be omitted and is not necessary, there are often people who like to add an "extra" act. Although this "act" may not be astonishing, it can allow a group of "wise men" to "greatly appease" their "restless" hearts.

Clearly, they have millions in wealth and servants galore, but they tell everyone they meet that they are poor, poor. What is the point of that? Conversely, there is a group of bachelors who, although they are always running to the pawnshop, boast to everyone they meet. Not only that, but they even "cite evidence" and say: "So-and-so comprador is my uncle, so-and-so factory director is related to me," and even Director So-and-so, who has nothing to do with them, becomes their "cousin." What is the point of that! Although the warehouses are piled high with spot goods, our "benevolent" gentleman "officially" declares that "it is not the case." But isn't this expensive "declaration" just "a superfluous act"! Others, such as guaranteeing with "reputation" or asking you to look at the "bills," are just the same old "tricks," but "magicians change their tricks; each has their own unique ingenuity"! But really, what is the point of that?

You perform "a superfluous act," and he does the same. Imperceptibly, "a superfluous act" has become "a necessary act." Since there is a tendency to "necessarily perform," it cannot be omitted. What would happen if it were omitted!

The trend of the times has not changed, and it has come to this. I am speechless!

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(7) Draw a Cross on the Face

"Although that's what you say, I don't know why, but my heart is very troubled today; anyway, you've already woken me up, let's go sit over there for a while!" Autumn Begonia knew that it was easiest for Yu Kun to go out. Wu Zi wouldn't tidy up, and the door wouldn't even be locked. He could just leave whenever he wanted. Therefore, without waiting for him to agree, she took the lead and stepped out of the room.

"Alright, if I don't go, you won't let me off." Yu Kun put his hands in the two pockets on his short jacket, a freshly lit "Front Gate" brand cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth, and a wrinkled Shandong silk robe slung over his left shoulder. He followed Autumn Begonia out in a lazy manner, saying in a muffled voice, "Go over there? I'm afraid of causing trouble, but I can't put it down…"

The "over there" they were referring to was actually the golden house that Autumn Begonia and Luo Xiangqi had secretly built—not the Luo family on Grain Rice Street—but on a very secluded road at the northern end of the British Concession. Every time they went, they would first go somewhere else and circle around once, then call a carriage and suddenly rush there unexpectedly, so that no matter how clever someone was, they wouldn't be able to follow them.

The homeowner was a wealthy old lady and her two granddaughters, who never asked about outside affairs. Moreover, when entering the house, Autumn Begonia had declared that he was a sailor, and his wife taught in a school and also served as a dormitory supervisor. Therefore, even though they rarely stayed there for a day or two each month, they didn't find it strange.

"Sir, please be quieter. Little Xianbao has had a slight fever since midnight and is still sound asleep in there!" When Autumn Begonia and Zhao Yu Kun walked up the half-stairway, the nanny, who was paid two or three times more than others and whose husband and children had been taken to Autumn Begonia's hometown in the eastern countryside of Cangzhou to live in a big house and enjoy a peaceful life, greeted them from inside the house, frowning and saying in a low, heavy voice.

"Did he catch a cold?" Autumn Begonia asked anxiously, immediately lowering his voice and grabbing the unusually loyal nanny.

"The weather has been too hot these past few days, and the little baby doesn't like wearing clothes. He might have caught a cold!"

As they spoke, the three of them had entered the outer room. This was the second floor of a small Western-style house—the landlord's family lived downstairs—the outer room was a large, open-plan room with two doors leading to the two rooms inside. The room by the balcony was Autumn Begonia and Xiangqi's bedroom, and the room behind was where the nanny lived with the child. (90)

### "One More Time"

— Jue Hui

After the Shandong man sold his fists with the "Bitter Trap," "Decisive Move," and "Continuous Attack." The audience will definitely shout out in unison: "Good! One more time!" So the Shandong man does it "one more time."

There is much hypocrisy in the world; there is even more deliberate pretense of truth knowing it to be hypocrisy; and there is even more of "one more time!"

With money, one can "communicate with the gods", and with power, one can act tyrannically. As long as money and power advance together, what's a "small" "one more time"?

"One" after another might be okay, but what's unbearable is that after "one" there is "one" more, and each "one" is more severe, and the poor die even more!

However, when we see those "Warnings" that say "Strict Punishment will be given, Violators will be punished," we can't help but shout: "Good! One more time!"

### Old Jin's Story

— Zuo Hui

Old Jin and I worked together in a shoe store for many years. He was a seasoned clerk, and his mouth could talk without thinking. He could never finish telling stories. He didn't need extra hot water or strong tea. All day and all night, as long as he wasn't bored, he would keep talking, and he would tell stories vividly and colorfully.

Old Yu relied on his sharp skills and managed to get a position as a servant in some restaurant on the main road. This was a very suitable position for Old Jin, and I was happy for him, and he was even more satisfied himself. I casually said, "Old Jin, you're in a good position now!"

"Good position," Old Jin's eyes wrinkled slightly as he smiled silently and said, "That's hard to say, but the salary is a bit more substantial than before."

"The salary is a bit more substantial than before, that's enough. Old Jin, you see, I'm the most useless, aren't I? Still guarding a counter."

"No, no…" Old Jin stammered and changed the subject: "The place I'm working at can be said to be one of the best in Shanghai. The people who come to our place are all high-class diners, either wearing suits and ties or wearing gowns and tortoise-shell glasses… all big gentlemen, young masters, and young mistresses."

"I'd like to patronize you sometime. How much is a big meal?"

"How much?" Old Jin laughed and said, "That's hard to say, at least a hundred or so…"

"A hundred or so! That's exactly one month's income, or maybe even not enough." I stuck out my tongue. Old Jin thought that was not surprising, so he brought out something else:

"Little Zheng, the price is really high, isn't it? But speaking of it, it has to be high. I'll tell you: the basins and spoons inside are all silver. Sometimes, when a dish comes out, it's lined with two or three silver basins underneath. This set of tools of the trade will definitely have to be produced on the heads of the diners. The chopsticks are made of real ivory. How much is ivory per ounce these days? Aren't a pair of chopsticks six or seven dollars? So, no wonder the price is counted in hundreds."

I listened and lowered my head. Without me even asking him, Old Jin's words flowed out naturally and incessantly: "The price is so high, the equipment is all brand new and shiny. Speaking of it, the taste must be different from the ordinary, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, a bowl of Ningbo salted vegetable fried with winter bamboo shoots costs five yuan, which is already quite a bit. But guess how much it costs to eat a bowl of salted vegetable fried with winter bamboo shoots at our place…"

"Double—let's say ten yuan." I said.

"Ten yuan? It costs sixteen yuan, look, look." Old Jin said, adding some explanation: "But Little Zheng, opening a restaurant or tavern is only possible if it's high-class, regardless of the price—high-class is naturally expensive, and low-class is naturally cheap—our restaurant is considered high-class, and the big bosses don't care if the price is not expensive. Moreover, saying the price is expensive only makes it sound better; the worst thing is being neither here nor there, not like high-class but not like low-class either. A restaurant like that is guaranteed to close its doors."

"If that's the case, I won't even dare to patronize you, my head would be scared flat first."

I laughed, and Old Jin also laughed. Suddenly, Old Jin stopped talking and said, "Little Zheng, don't say you're scared flat for nothing, there are really interesting things too: once, a few bumpkins came. Everyone sat down and ate, and when the bill came out later, even all the money they had on them wasn't enough; and another time, a friend in a suit actually stared blankly at the bill and said, 'How much does a bowl of porridge cost?' Later, I explained to him that we calculate it by the table, if one person at a table orders a bowl of porridge, then the other people at the table, even if they haven't eaten porridge, we also count them in it: if we calculated it bowl by bowl, then it would be too troublesome. The friend in the suit could only roll his eyes and take a breath, you think—"

"Oh, oh." I exclaimed in surprise.

Ah, meeting Old Jin, we talked for a very, very long time. I believe Old Jin must have many more stories; but, thinking that I still have unfinished business myself, I reminded Old Jin, "There are so many people on the road today. Next time, if you have time, come over to our place and sit for a while."

"That's right!" Old Yu said: "I also have things to do now, so let's meet in a few days."

I watched Old Jin walk through the crowd. I walked and thought: There are really many places to spend money in Shanghai. A hundred or so yuan is nothing! But how much time, how much labor, how much… alas, Shanghai, do we have to spend to get this hundred or so yuan?

### "Cold"

— Shu Ying

From spring to summer, from autumn to winter, normal cold is not strange, not worrying. But recently, the "weather" is not right, suddenly hot, suddenly cold, making people complain, it is sad!

People with sufficient blood and qi naturally don't care about the cold; but the naturally poor, anemic, can't resist the repeated cold. Once cold, you freeze once!

"Man will conquer nature" is, after all, a "beautiful lie"; just like shouting hungry with the last breath is useless.

But the abnormal cold is just a so-called "burst," and after spring it will not be winter; it's summer—"can't get cold," what can you do?

(At that time, there will definitely be people with "heatstroke." Amitabha)

### "Night of Revelry"

— Mo Ye

Just as Belinsky said, we have the same view of Gogol: he can maintain calm in his indignation, and preserve kindness in his cunning. In his works, he severely satirizes some anti-progressive currents and mediocre bureaucrats. In "The Inspector General" (that is, Night of Revelry). There is more of this writing tendency. I was moved by his witty dialogue. Whether from the technical aspect or the use of characters, he has extraordinary achievements.

Mr. Lu Si's adaptation of "Night of Revelry" did not make much change in the character of the characters and the division of scenes. It only adapts the environment, plot, and character of the characters to the actual environment of the performance.

At a time when the theatrical movement on the island is tending to split, and the historical professional troupe is touting "art first," regardless of the appropriateness of the adaptation, the adequacy of the skills, and the more prominent character of the characters, just from the point of view of social value... We also have to give him a full evaluation.

That is a funny comedy! In that pile of laughter, we see the darkness of the court, the preoccupation with one's own interests, the corruption of politics, and those ugly and unsightly strange phenomena, all of which are reproduced on the stage frame. We have not seen a satirical comedy for a long time since "Professional Women." I think this anti-"anti-progressive" torrent will definitely wash away those guys on the island who are obsessed with a life of pleasure and extravagance.

Many of the actors seem to lack stage experience. For example, Gong Tianliang, who plays Jia Gong, has no inner expression when acting, and his voice is so low and thin that he really needs to put in some research. He has many trivial actions, but in the actions, in the appearance, you can see the expression of his "first self" everywhere.

The same is true of Zhou Zhengxing (playing Lizhu) and Lu Shan (playing Wu Shi). In Lizhu's case, we should seriously point out many places. First, there is a lack of imagination. If you want to make your acting skills more versatile, you must have imagination. Second, there is no understanding of the character's personality and environment. These are all necessary conditions for being an actor. I believe that effort will not be wasted!

Feng Qun and Hu Wenji are still good, and Mao Feng also has very superior success. In many places, you can see his hard work, which we should praise!

I have seen director Muni's "Golden Silk Crow." The setting of the position was not in line with the plot, the atmosphere was relaxed, and it was not a successful work. This time, "Night of Revelry" has more actors, and the position of the actors in the last scene is simply chaotic. The introduction of the characters in the first scene is also lacking in consideration. The fourth scene is better, and the original work helped him. However, we must never set the level of criticism too high. He is still more promising among the latecomers, and we look forward to his efforts and not giving up on himself.

The scenery is too gorgeous, and the exaggeration is wrong. Comedy requires exaggeration of the actor's actions. Using peculiar props to make people laugh is forced and will not move the audience. The overly luxurious furnishings will affect the effect of the performance, and the director should bear most of the responsibility for this.

### Scattered Reporter in Shadow City

— Hui Lin

Loretta Young's younger sister is called Qi Yana. It is said that she is better at acting than her other sisters. She is now playing a key role in a continuous drama by Columbia Pictures. This is a comedy. Four or five people have tried the lens of the film, but they were all rejected. The big current has determined Qi Yana. In the future, Qi Yana will have a day to compete with her sister Loretta on the screen.

The US tax authorities believe that the richest star in Shadow City is Chaplin. According to accurate estimates, he has more than three million gold yuan; in addition to Chaplin, the wealthy stars are: Lock, Little Fan Pengke, Claude White, Hua Reis Pi Lei and Marie Pickford, etc. Although the US tax authorities cannot be completely sure of the accurate property estimates of movie stars, they can still know the approximate amount.

Many film companies in Hollywood are trying to win over Nuo Kowaite to sign an actor contract with him. Kowaite is a famous British screenwriter and is very good at acting. Last year, he once went to the United States via Shanghai. After arriving in Hollywood, all parties pursued him vigorously, but he politely declined because showing his face on the stage would affect his work. Kowaite and Hollywood's famous British star Carlie Glenn are very close.

"Killer" James McNeille used to forbid his sister Qi En from filming and sent her to school in the eastern United States from afar; but now her little sister suddenly returned to Hollywood and signed a contract with Paramount, as if preparing to make a big splash. At the same time, Jacques Knight's attitude is also very happy and no longer prevents her. It is said that Qi En Jacques Knight is also one of the most beautiful girls in Shadow City.

### Summary of the Philosophy of Exertion

— Zong Yu

Life exists in a moving world. Only by using movement to cope with the moving environment, and only by using movement to seek victorious survival. If you violate the universal law of movement and insist on using stillness to deal with everything, the result will only be abandonment by the passive world.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 7 Besiege the City and Kill the Generals

The men were even more excited and ready to set fire, but Li Xin quickly stopped them and said, "The officials of Qi County can certainly be killed, but the people of Qi County are innocent. I am grateful for your kindness in rescuing me from prison. Now that we have obtained ill-gotten wealth, please leave the old and young of Qi County and spare them from suffering. I, Li Xin, will be eternally grateful." Hong Niangzi listened to Li Xin's words, so she stopped her subordinates from setting fire and looting. She ordered them to quickly break out of the city and not linger any longer. The group closely followed the retreating troops of General Feng and chased them out of the city. Coincidentally, Tong Tianbao had already led the men of Qing Stone Mountain across the moat outside the city, climbed the city wall, cut open the city gate, and lowered the drawbridge to meet Hong Niangzi, Li Xin, and the others, and they encountered General Feng. Tong Tianbao sat on a red-maned crow, which was his sister's mount. He wielded a pair of copper hammers in his hands, and he intercepted General Feng, blocking his way. General Feng was attacked from both sides, making him very embarrassed, and his heart was even more flustered. Tong Tianbao was unusually brave and strong, and he was a fresh force. After fighting only a few rounds, Hong Niangzi and Li Xin and the others had already caught up from behind, and the two sides joined forces, turning around and encircling General Feng and his government troops. The people of Qi County already knew the power of the Qing Stone Mountain bandits. Hearing the warning, they all hid in their homes, closed their doors, and dared not come out, no matter how rampant the Qing Stone Mountain troops were. General Feng was attacked from the front and back by the Hong Niangzi siblings. Although he resisted desperately, he only had parrying skills in his hands. He was taken advantage of by Tong Tianbao, who struck him in the left shoulder with a hammer. He somersaulted and fell off his horse. The men of Qing Stone Mountain were about to step forward to capture him, but he shouted loudly, "Who dares to capture me? I am a soldier of the country, and I will not accept humiliation!" He held the knife across his own neck and committed suicide. Li Xin watched from the side, nodding and sighing. The government troops, because General Feng was martyred, grabbed his body and scattered and retreated. Hong Niangzi then taught Tong Tianbao not to loot, and to gather the men and rush out of the city gate together. Tong Tianbao changed a mount, and gave the red mane to his sister to ride, and also gave a white horse to Li Xin to ride. (47)

### Third Talk on "Playing the Flower Drum"

— Zou Xiao

The 17th this published Qian Naijiang's "On Playing the Flower Drum," which said: "The test of this play originally came from the Yuan people's miscellaneous works." The 18th this published Wang Kui's "My Views on Playing the Flower Drum," which said: "This play was written by the Yuan survivors in the early Ming Dynasty. Although it is included in the Yuan people's miscellaneous dramas, the period of compilation was actually after the late Yuan Dynasty... Kunqu's script is adapted from the Yuan people's miscellaneous dramas, called Huaguo alone." Both of these statements are wrong. In fact, there is no Huaguo like Pingju in Yuan people's miscellaneous works or dramas. The earliest Huaguo with Ergu Chui must not be earlier than the Ming Dynasty. Ming people's Diyang Jilue said: "When the people of Sizhou (which belonged to Fengyang Prefecture in the Ming Dynasty) planted rice, men and women from distant villages sang and beat drums to each other, which was quite mixed with customs." The Yuan Dynasty simply did not have this kind of Huaguo, at least we can't see such records in the literature. The so-called "Kunqu's script" mainly refers to the "Huaguo" in the first volume of "Zhui Bai Qiu" sixth volume. In fact, it is Luantan, not Kunqu, which clearly writes Bangzi tune, Zaban, Gaoqiang Jiban, etc. There is also Xianhuadiao, which is Xianhuadiao, which is a ditty. This "Huaguo" is at most from the Qing Dynasty folk Yangko, and the Yuan people's miscellaneous drama items such as "Lu Guibu" "Jin Le Kaozheng" "Qulu" and so on do not have such a title.

As for the consciousness of playing the flower drum, Mr. Qian said that it helped Ming Taizu's revolution, and Mr. Wang said that it was Yuan's survivors scolding Ming Taizu. The former can use Yu Ling's newly compiled Da Ming Yinglie Biography as an example, but it is not an old play and cannot be used as proof; the latter can be proved by the words of Pingju itself. In fact, they are all wrong. The words in the Huaguo do have a little resentment, that is the Ming Dynasty Fengyang people themselves, not the Yuan Dynasty survivors. This is a historical fact, and both the Ming History and the "Fengyang New Book" have records. Wang Lian's "Yin'an Suohua" in the early Ming Dynasty said; "My county must have beggars from Fengyang in Jiangnan every year. Yu Chang asked an old beggar, Yun Hongwu ordered the relocation of 140,000 wealthy households in Susong Hang Jiahu to Fengyang, and those who fled back were prohibited, so they entrusted beggars to sneak back to visit graves and visit relatives, and it has become a habit to this day." He Ru "Xiao Xia Xian Ji Zhai Chao", Wang Yodun's poems have similar records. Cha Qianlongjian Zhao Yi Gai Yu Cong Kao Yun: "Every year in winter, the counties of Jiangsu must have people from Fengyang, old and young men and women, lined up in teams, scattered into villages to beg for food, until the second and third months of Mingchun to return. The singing is: I live in Luzhou and Fengyang, Fengyang is a good place. Since Zhu Huangdi came out, there have been nine years of famine in ten years." But Yu Ling's revision is meaningful and in line with historical facts, which is a must.
