Reuters News Agency, Stockholm, 23rd - Churchill's trip to Washington is accompanied by British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook, General Pender, General Dill, and General Portal. U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant and President Roosevelt's personal representative Harriman are also traveling with him.

Havas News Agency, Washington, 22nd - The White House announced that President Roosevelt has taken preliminary measures to organize a "unified action mechanism" among all countries at war with the Axis powers. According to Presidential Secretary Early, the President has met separately with Chinese Ambassador Hu Shih, Soviet Ambassador Litvinov, and the Dutch Minister to discuss this issue "within the scope of a policy to coordinate the war efforts of all countries." With the cooperation of the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, China, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and other countries, a plan can be decided upon in the near future, but today's meeting was only preliminary in nature.

Reuters News Agency, Lisbon, 23rd - The American people are very interested in British Prime Minister Churchill's visit to the United States and are speculating about the content of his talks with Roosevelt and other British dignitaries. According to dispatches from Washington, the main topic of the meeting will be the Allied joint operation plan. In addition, the establishment of a Supreme Allied Military Council will also be discussed. Well-informed sources in Washington indicate that the current war must be dealt with through a global strategy. Each theater of war should operate autonomously, allowing for decisive action. The Supreme Military Council does not need to issue commands; its sole purpose is to promote the implementation of a common policy by the Allied nations. U.S. military officials believe that the outcome of this negotiation will give the United States supreme command in the Pacific, and General MacArthur may be appointed as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Pacific.

Havas News Agency, Washington, 23rd - President Roosevelt's meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill at the White House has sparked heated discussions in the United States, widely regarded as the initial step in the military coordination of the Allied nations. According to reliable sources, British and American authorities are drafting a plan to divide the world into four war zones: Europe as the first war zone, the Middle East and North Africa as the second war zone, North America as the third war zone, and the Pacific and Far East as the fourth war zone. Currently, the Soviet troops are operating in the first war zone, the British Empire troops in the second war zone, and it is planned to establish a high-level naval and air force command in the third war zone, headed by a British officer. The high-level command of the fourth war zone will be headed by a U.S. officer. Above them, a Supreme Allied Military Committee is planned to be established, which will appoint the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces to oversee the overall war situation.

The key points are as follows: The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union respect Iran's territorial integrity and political independence. Iran immediately allows British and Soviet troops to transit through its territory and allows them to use its transportation lines. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union will establish naval, land, and air bases in Iran, without any restrictions on the number. The three signatory countries shall not independently make peace with other countries.

Reuters News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - Thailand and France have resolved their disputes, and Thailand has also established an alliance with Japan. Thailand is a rice-producing country, with nine-tenths of its land producing rice. Although Japan feels a shortage of food due to the hostility of Burma, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines, what it obtains from Vietnam and Thailand can more than compensate for it. Domestic trade in Thailand is entirely dominated by the Chinese, with all 700 rice mills in Thailand owned by the Chinese. Old politicians believe that benefits can be obtained from the United Kingdom and the United States, and the Thai royal family is also pro-British and pro-American. The cooperation between Japan and Thailand is due to the fact that the two countries belong to the same race. The Thai army can match the Japanese army, and the Thai people also know how to preserve their national culture. The religion of Thailand has seen great reforms. Since France was defeated by Germany, the Japanese army has been stationed on the eastern border of Thailand, catching the United Kingdom off guard.

### Battle of Hong Kong in Progress; Chinese Army Approaches Kowloon; Japan Claims to Have Occupied Cameron Fortress

Reuters News Agency, Local News - According to a broadcast from San Francisco, the Chinese army has advanced to within seven miles of the border of Kowloon.

Reuters News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - A report received here last night stated that the battle of Hong Kong is still in progress. Japanese bombers have almost completely destroyed all British anti-aircraft gun positions in Hong Kong. According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," the Japanese advance is proceeding according to plan. Currently, there are approximately 20,000 British troops in Hong Kong, of which approximately 3,000 are regular British troops, approximately 4,000 are Canadian and American troops, approximately 6,000 are Indian troops, and approximately 4,000 are Chinese and other nationalities volunteer troops. The Japanese Navy participating in the blockade is also assisting the ground forces in their operations. Several British cruisers were sunk on Sunday.

Reuters News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - At 11:00 p.m. last night, the Japanese army operating in Hong Kong occupied the British artillery fort on Cameron Mountain. This fort is one of the strongest fortresses in Hong Kong. Currently, the Japanese army's target is Victoria Peak.

In the afternoon of the 22nd, they were moved to the isolated army camp in Kowloon Hospital. Among the prisoners was Major Johnston Bedson of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, who is the manager of the Hong Kong Jardine Matheson shipping company and also a director of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. He is highly respected in the business community. This time, he was called up as the captain of the volunteer corps, responsible for the defense of the Hong Kong Electric Company, and was captured in Causeway Bay. Most of the prisoners were poorly dressed and showed signs of hard fighting.

Reuters News Agency, Local Special Dispatch - It has been reported that a British military communique from Singapore stated that the British army in Malaya has built a new position behind the Kuala River and has returned to its artillery to score victories.

Reuters News Agency, Bangkok, 23rd - According to news from Batavia, well-informed sources in the Dutch East Indies regard the current war news on the Pacific front as "the calm before the storm." Therefore, the Dutch East Indies should be more vigilant and prepare everything, as the second phase of the war is about to begin. The people of the Dutch East Indies share this view, so there is no sign of relaxation anywhere. The people are accustomed to the wartime state, such as blackout regulations. Recently, there have been slightly more people entering movie theaters and restaurants. Various government agencies have increased staff, such as the air defense teams, and people are required to participate, so there is no time for leisure.

### British Army in Malaya Defends the Position of Kuala Kangsar; Japanese Army Advances South Along the Perak River; Ipoh, a Tin-Producing Area, Feels Threatened; Dutch East Indies Intensifies Preparations to Respond to Changes

Reuters News Agency, Bangkok, 23rd - According to information obtained here from Singapore, a recent communique issued by Singapore stated that the British army is currently defending the position of Kuala Kangsar. However, according to well-informed sources, the situation on the east and west coasts has become very critical since the British army withdrew from the Kelantan front. Kuala Kangsar is located approximately fifteen miles northwest of Ipoh. The British withdrawal from Kelantan is not surprising, as this jungle area is not suitable for establishing a defense line. If Ipoh is lost, its seriousness is no less than the loss of Penang, as this place is the starting point for modern transportation facilities south of the Malay Peninsula. Military sources in Singapore say that although the Japanese army suffered heavy losses near Kuala Kangsar, it is still advancing south along the Perak River. Ipoh is an important tin-producing area in Malaya.

### Singapore, Commanding the South China Sea

South of the equator, there are very few continental areas to be found, especially in Asia, which is entirely north of the equator. Singapore, an island, is only separated from the Malay Peninsula by a narrow strait. There is now a causeway connecting it to the peninsula, so it is not unreasonable to say that Singapore is the southernmost tip of the Asian continent. The island is a British crown colony, and its strategic importance has become even more apparent after the completion of its military facilities. Now that the defense of Singapore is underway, it is absolutely necessary, as Frank Freidel, Reuters' special correspondent in Washington, stated, that Singapore must be secured by the United Nations.

South African Newspaper Accuses British Authorities of Neglect

Havas News Agency, Johannesburg, 22nd - The "Rand Daily Mail" here recently published an editorial discussing the current war, stating that the United Kingdom's urgent task is to restore rationality, as the British nation is too confident, such as the defense of Hong Kong in the event of a war in the Far East, which was only decided recently. Although defenses were increased several times, the situation in Hong Kong has become shaky only five days after the start of the war. We have also been negligent in Malaya. Furthermore, the authorities often say that our army is bravely resisting various new tactics there, but in reality, these tactics are already well known today. At this critical moment, the United Kingdom should also prepare to give the enemy some surprises.

Member of Parliament Loudly Calls for No More Procrastination

Havas News Agency, London, 22nd - Granville, a Member of Parliament from the National Liberal Party, delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, saying, "The safety of Hong Kong is tied to the entire destiny of the British Empire, so all resources must be mobilized to defend it. I dare to ask the government, are we taking a definite policy in Malaya? I urge the government to provide a reply. We can no longer sit idly by and watch the government take half-hearted measures or lose opportunities by looking in all directions. It must be known that using lifeboats as was done in Dunkirk cannot be seen again today. For the present plan, it is necessary to mobilize all the resources of the Empire, including Indian resources, under the control of the highest authorities. If we are determined to fight to the end in Malaya, then this plan of ours should be pursued relentlessly, without being obstructed by anything. The fact is that our army is already ready and waiting, and the same is true for our workers. Finally, please do not forget, there will be no Christmas holidays this year in Hong Kong."

### Renowned American General Appointed Supreme Commander of the Navy; Certain to Display Extraordinary Talent; Unanimous Welcome from the Naval Community

Havas News Agency, Washington, 22nd - President Roosevelt's appointment of Admiral Ernest King as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy has been unanimously welcomed by naval personnel here, who say that Admiral King is an outstanding general in the U.S. Navy and has fully demonstrated his extraordinary talent during his tenure as Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. When President Roosevelt appointed Admiral King as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, he also granted him great power, practically unlimited power, sufficient to make him the most powerful naval commander in U.S. history. Previously, naval operations were the responsibility of the Chief of Naval Operations, but now they are directed by Admiral King. As for Admiral Nimitz, Commander of the Pacific Fleet, and Admiral Hart, Commander of the Asiatic Fleet, they remain in their original positions but must be subject to Admiral King's control. The same is true for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, but his power will inevitably be reduced because Admiral King reports directly to President Roosevelt. Admiral King is 62 years old and is known in the U.S. Navy as "The Eagle."

### Inside Story of the Change of German Commander-in-Chief: Protracted War on the Eastern Front, Popular Disappointment, Dismissal of Brauchitsch to Shift Blame

Stockholm, 23rd -- According to an official communiqué from the German Information Bureau, Hitler has dismissed the German Commander-in-Chief, Brauchitsch, and assumed the position himself. Hitler had already declared himself Supreme Commander of the German Armed Forces in 1938. The official communiqué released on December 20 regarding Brauchitsch's dismissal stated that, given the expansion of the war on the Eastern Front, unexpectedly, it was necessary for Hitler to assume the position of Commander-in-Chief. The communiqué also called for the integration of various aspects of the war through political and wartime economic measures. At the same time, Hitler issued a "Message to the Troops," stating, "The war has now reached its peak and turning point. The German forces on the Eastern Front must face a dangerous enemy. Due to the sudden arrival of winter, the German forces must henceforth transition from mobile warfare to positional warfare." The mission of each army is "to stubbornly defend everything won at great sacrifice." Hitler said he was well aware of their hardships and the pressures they were under, and encouraged the soldiers, demanding that each army fight with all its might and "obey faithfully" to save Germany. In the same message, Hitler also attempted to boost the morale of his troops by referencing the victories of the Japanese army in the Pacific war. Hitler touched on the difficulty of maintaining communication between various sectors of the German front and vaguely discussed new military strategies he was preparing. This official Berlin communiqué, as well as other reports received from reliable sources in Stockholm, indicate that the dismissal of Brauchitsch, the leader of the German aggression for the past three and a half years, is a clear result of the failure of the German fascists' plans on the Soviet-German front. Germany's failure has led to a serious crisis among German commanders and has fueled disagreements between Nazi leaders and the German military. It is believed that Hitler is using Brauchitsch as a scapegoat and risking damage to the reputation of Germany's "invincible" generals in an attempt to shift blame for the failure on the Soviet-German front. According to reports from Berlin, after Hitler assumed the position of Army Commander-in-Chief, he may retaliate against those at the front and rear who express dissatisfaction and disbelief. Recent reports from Berlin indicate that the impression Germany's failure on the Soviet-German front has made on the German home front is deepening daily. The public is increasingly cynical about the German propaganda machine's talk of "consolidating front positions" and "organized retreats" because the heavy losses of German soldiers and materiel have had a significant impact on the rear. This situation is becoming increasingly serious.

Brauchitsch Issues Farewell Message to Soldiers

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - Former German Army Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Brauchitsch issued the following farewell message to the soldiers on the day of his retirement: "Soldiers! The Führer has today assumed personal command of the German Army. I have repeatedly requested to be relieved of my duties to rest due to a heart condition. The Führer has now granted my request. Soldiers, I have been your Army Commander-in-Chief for nearly four years. During this time, many great historical events have occurred in Germany, and our army has achieved the greatest military victories. Every time I think of this, feelings of pride and gratitude arise spontaneously. I am proud of your great achievements and grateful for your loyalty. Although the great task has been completed, the future is not without greater and more difficult work. I believe that you will be able to cope with it adequately. The Führer will surely lead us to victory. May you all await the good news with iron-like faith."

Havas News Agency, Rome, 22nd -- The German Führer Hitler's assumption of the position of Army Commander-in-Chief is being taken very seriously here. All newspapers believe that this will be a new driving force in the war. His message to the Army and Stormtroopers, as well as the German semi-official criticism, are all published on the front page without criticism. According to a dispatch from the Fascist Workers' Newspaper correspondent in Berlin, this German decision is a sign of major military developments to come. Germany will not only defeat the Soviet Union, but will also send troops to fight on other fronts, as the current war has already evolved into a world war, and German troops will be fighting on all fronts.

### Soviet Army Pursues German Army, Progresses Extremely Rapidly, Penetrating 250 Kilometers in Half a Month, German Side Claims Soviet Counter-offensive Repelled

Moscow, 23rd -- Lieutenant General Golikov wrote in Red Star newspaper today that the Red Army under his command is pursuing the German troops extremely rapidly, advancing 250 kilometers in 15 days. It is claimed that a month ago, Germany announced to the world that German troops had begun their second offensive against Moscow. At that time, the fascists not only dreamed of attacking from both wings, but also planned to attack from our country's rear, southeast and southern regions. At one point, the situation was quite serious. Stalin ordered a certain army to secretly gather at a certain point and, in conjunction with neighboring armies, strike a heavy blow. Under the heavy blow of our army against the German forces under von Kleist's command, the entire German front wavered. At this point, the German side had no choice but to retreat, citing excessively cold weather. Our army broke through the enemy's first line of defense and continued to attack its second line of defense. Although this line of defense was extremely important to the German army, the German troops were unable to hold it. The line of defense was located on the west bank of the Don River. The German troops had built solid fortifications there three days before our army arrived, but it was still to no avail. Our army crossed the river and continued to advance towards important industrial areas. The 112th and 25th divisions were almost completely annihilated. The remnants retreated westward.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - It was announced here yesterday that on Sunday, Soviet troops continued to counterattack against German troops at various points in the central sector of the Eastern Front, but were unsuccessful. In several places, after German troops launched attacks, Soviet troops abandoned their armor and fled, leaving behind many tanks and corpses.

### Portugal: Anti-British Demonstrations, Hope that the Timor Incident Can Be Resolved Amicably

Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 23rd -- An anti-British demonstration was held in Porto, northern Portugal, yesterday. Police were on guard in front of the British and American consulates to provide protection. The guards in front of the British Embassy in Lisbon were increased yesterday and were carrying rifles and automatic pistols.

Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 23rd -- Newspapers here yesterday still hoped that the dispute between Britain and Portugal caused by the Timor incident would be resolved amicably. Therefore, all newspapers hoped that Britain would take action, but so far, Britain has not accepted this proposal. The British government still insists that Portuguese Timor is in danger of being attacked by Japan. If extensive military protection is not provided, the danger to the island will still exist. Informed sources here believe that the island should be defended by Portugal's own forces. Therefore, discussions are underway to send a batch of Portuguese troops to the island, but the transportation problem is difficult to solve. This problem includes sending tens of thousands of Portuguese troops to the Far East via the Cape of Good Hope. The first transport ship for this purpose is being prepared. This proves Portugal's determination to protect its territory using its own strength. The Portuguese authorities' adoption of this measure is not accidental, as Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar has repeatedly mentioned in his speeches the preparation to strengthen the garrison in Timor. However, whether the British are willing to give up this acquired military stronghold is a question, as the island is located midway on the shipping route from Singapore to Australia. Lisbon hopes that Britain will recognize that the Portuguese army has strong strength and modern weapons.

### The Soviet Union and Christianity - 4

The Soviet Union's official spokesman Lozovsky issued a preliminary declaration on the 14th, based on the 1936 constitution, reiterating that the Soviet people have the freedom to believe in any religion, and at the same time have the freedom to engage in various anti-religious activities and propaganda. This declaration was a direct response to President Roosevelt's hope that there would be complete religious freedom in the Soviet Union.

To understand the Soviet Union's attitude towards religion, we must go back to the Tsarist era, when the Orthodox Church was generally regarded as an instrument of the Tsarist regime to suppress the people. Article 124 of the Soviet Constitution promulgated in 1936 states: "In order to ensure freedom of conscience for the people, the church and politics are separated in the Soviet Russian Federation, and schools and churches are separated. All people are equally recognized as having the freedom to perform religious rites and to engage in anti-religious propaganda." Lozovsky's declaration this time was based on this article.

Lozovsky's declaration stated: "Soviet public opinion is paying close attention to President Roosevelt's declaration at a press conference that there is freedom of religious belief in the Soviet Union. President Roosevelt correctly pointed out the basic principles of freedom of religious belief for the Soviet people in the Soviet Constitution. In the Soviet Union, politics and religion are separated, that is, the state does not favor any one religion or support any one church, such as Islam, Christianity, or Jewish churches. People who believe in a certain religion can maintain their religious institutions at their own expense.

"There is freedom of religious belief in the Soviet Union, which means that any person in the Soviet Union can believe in any religion, according to the choice of each individual's conscience. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, there are Greek Orthodox Churches, Greek Protestant Churches, Old Believers, Armenian Churches, Zoroastrian Churches, Religious Communist Parties, Evangelical Churches, Baptist Churches, Sunday School Churches, Evangelical Churches, as well as Judaism, Roman Catholicism, Buddhism, and so on. Because religion is a private matter for Soviet citizens, the state does not interfere and believes that there is no need to interfere.

"The Soviet Constitution stipulates that people not only have the right to believe in a certain religion, but also have the right not to be affiliated with any church and to conduct anti-religious propaganda. The Soviet Constitution believes that people cannot be forced to believe in a certain religion or not to believe in a certain religion. This is a matter of each individual's conscience and has nothing to do with the state.

"The Soviet Constitution is based on the following: Freedom to worship any religion assumes that this religion, church, or congregation is not used to overthrow the existing system recognized in the country. The Soviet Union's policy on religious issues has been clearly stated in Article 124 of the Soviet Constitution."

From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's fundamental attitude towards the worship of theocracy has not changed at all. However, the importance of Lozovsky's declaration lies only in the fact that he made this declaration and that, for a matter of sufficient importance as religion, an analysis of the attitude towards this issue must be published, and it must be reiterated as having been formally recognized.

Lozovsky made simple verbal comments on his declaration and answered reporters' comments, saying: Overseas people who raise the issue of religious freedom in the Soviet Union are also criticizing President Roosevelt's political policies. Some of them also support Germany. The main question is whether to support Germany or support the Soviet Union.

He said: "People who raise the issue of freedom of belief can be said to be worrying needlessly, and many of them do not bother to understand the Soviet Union's attitude towards religion."

He said that the Soviet Anti-Religious Museum will continue to perform its function as a part of human cultural history, just like the planetarium of astronomy.

### Tedious Investigation and Registration Procedures, Establishment of Price Management Branch

Various Flours to Be Sold at Limited Prices from Today, Huge Amount of Rice Expected to Arrive Soon, French Concession Issued Coal Briquette Transportation Permits Yesterday

The Price Management Committee of the Public Concession has been established for several months and is yet to make any progress in stabilizing prices and combating illegal hoarding. According to the person in charge of the committee yesterday, in order to further stabilize prices, active preparations are underway to expand the organization of the committee in the short term. In addition to the general meeting, a branch will be established to assist the general meeting in stabilizing prices. He continued, "All merchants in the city, in addition to complying with the various measures set by the committee, are also expected to provide the committee with practical assistance."

Busy with Registration

It is reported that the Price Management Committee will continue to handle the registration procedures for various commodities. All merchants must go to the designated location to complete the registration and fill in the forms as soon as they receive a notice from the committee. It is believed that this move by the committee aims to eliminate the bad practice of hoarding and to balance the supply of goods. Anyone who refuses to register goods will be deemed to be hoarding illegally and will have their goods confiscated and confiscated according to law. In addition, when transporting and selling registered goods, merchants must apply to the committee for a transportation permit to prevent goods from being smuggled out of the country.

Price Limits for Noodles

From the 24th of this month, the selling price of cut noodles will be 95 cents per catty. The maximum limited price for macaroni, thin noodles, vermicelli, and other similar items, including packaging, will be $1.65 per pound for wholesale and $1.80 per pound for retail. This price limit must be observed by all cut noodle shops and manufacturers located in the Public Concession and the extra-settlement area of western Shanghai that have obtained flour and other raw materials with the assistance of this bureau.

Cake and Mantou Industry Hopes for Maximum Supply

The Shanghai Cake and Mantou Industry Association, with more than 300 members, has been affected by the soaring flour prices, which has affected business. It has successively suggested that the Bureau of Works be requested to supply flour at reasonable prices and has repeatedly informed its members to maintain the original prices and protect the lives of the common people, which has been widely praised by all sectors of society. Recently, after receiving 1,500 bags of reasonable-priced flour approved by the Bureau of Works, it immediately distributed and allocated the flour to members at No. 133 Ningxing Street, French Concession, according to the amount of flour required by each member each day. Since the 10th of this month, it has been difficult to carry the entire bag for business due to the authorities' restrictions. The association has now presented the situation to the French authorities to issue transportation permits. It is reported that the association has notified flour users in the two concessions to request assistance from the Bureau of Works before the 29th of this month and is actively notifying all members to proceed. At the same time, it is very grateful for the Bureau of Works' assistance in supplying flour so that all members can continue to do business. As for the distribution of reasonable-priced flour to new members of the association, it is planned to be distributed evenly within days. In addition, regarding the flour used by cake and mantou businesses in the future, it is still hoped that the authorities in the two concessions will supply as much as possible.

Negotiations on Rice Transportation

The Rice Control Committee of the Bureau of Works is currently in negotiations with the relevant Japanese authorities to transport rice from French Indochina to Shanghai to increase the city's rice reserves. It is reported that a large amount of imported rice will soon enter Shanghai, and the matter of using neutral ships in the concession to transport imported rice is currently under consideration. In addition, the Rice Control Committee of the Bureau of Works has made every effort to obtain assistance from Wuhu rice. It is expected that 2 million dan will be transported from Wuhu to Shanghai in the near future. It is reported that the selling price of Wuhu rice is 100 yuan per dan, but the distribution method is currently unknown. As for the retail of domestic rice along the streets, there have been more in the French Concession recently.

Improvement of Reasonable Rice Selling Method Under Consideration

The Shanghai Rice Industry Association received a letter from citizens in the French Concession a few days ago, stating that unfortunate events often occur when rice shops sell imported rice at reasonable prices. The reason is that the supply of imported rice is not universal. It is suggested that citizens should be required to form separate queues for men, women, the elderly, and children when buying rice. The association believes that this method is still necessary and yesterday dispatched committee member Qu Zhenhua to negotiate with the members of the Rice Management Committee. It is reported that the Rice Management Committee has agreed to consider improvements. The Rice Office of the Bureau of Works yesterday continued to designate Taikoo on the Bund, Maotai on Baker Road, and Xinyuan on Xiamen Road as the three warehouses for rice shops to apply for the allocation of imported rice for retail. Factories, schools, and hospitals that come to apply will continue to be accepted, but applications from groups and individuals are still temporarily suspended. The crowds gathered in front of the rice shops are still very crowded. Therefore, the public hopes that the rice shops will resume their normal business state under the prudent methods of the Bureau of Works to eliminate this phenomenon.

Coal Prices Drop

Due to tight monetary conditions, major coal dealers, believing that the authorities are determined to control coal, are eager to sell their large-scale hoarding. After the coal market opened yesterday, the spot goods increased sharply, and the selling price dropped sharply, but buyers were also unwilling to continue to add to their stockpiles due to the lack of a way out. Therefore, although there are abundant spot goods in the market, few people are interested. According to a coal merchant, the price of smoke-free white coal will gradually drop back soon. After the coal and charcoal shops in the Public Concession obtained coal briquette transportation permits on the 19th of this month, each shop has resumed retail sales in recent days, with each household limited to half a dan (25 kilograms) per day. This transportation permit will expire tomorrow (ten days), and all shops must apply to the Bureau of Works for a new permit. As for the coal and charcoal shops in the French Concession, they also obtained transportation permits separately yesterday and will use them starting today. The date of use for each permit is also limited to seven days. Therefore, ordinary coal briquettes will be sold in the French Concession starting today at a price of 20 yuan per dan.

### Sugar Shop Exceeds Price Limits; Ordered to Suspend Business for Three Days

Shengchang South Goods, Sugar and Confectionery Store at 657 Fuzhou Road, was found by the Public Works Department to be selling food products above the set price limits. It has now been decided that the store will be ordered to suspend business for three days, starting yesterday, as a warning. A public notice will be posted at the store entrance. It is reported that several other businesses have received the same punishment.

Lu Liqing's Birthday Celebration

Madam Lu Liqing (the widow of the late Shanghai figure Ji Yunqing) celebrated her fifty-ninth birthday on the 28th of this month. Given the extraordinary times, she initially did not want to hold any celebrations. However, friends of the late Ji insisted on offering their congratulations, as Madam Lu was regarded as a compassionate and upright role model for women. Therefore, a banquet was held on that day at the Lotus Zen Temple on Baidie Road. The performances included the "Double Ten Drama" specially written by Lu Xixi and Xu Renqiu, comedic acts by Yi Fangshuo and Zhang Yier, and Shanghai opera by Shi Chunxuan. Following Madam Lu's instructions, all arrangements were kept as simple as possible.

Yesterday's newspaper was issued at 6:10 PM.

Commercial News

The Price Difference Between Spot Yarn and Factory Orders is Four to Five Hundred Yuan

The spot yarn market is deteriorating daily, and the situation is quite unstable. This is due to the sharp drop in gold prices, which has caused panic. Many are selling off their factory orders, resulting in weak market transactions. The price of 42-count Lanfeng factory orders is 3,500 yuan. The price of 20-count Shuangma factory orders initially reached 1,580 yuan, but due to a surge in supply, the asking price gradually decreased to 1,525 yuan, a sharp drop of 100-200 yuan compared to the previous day. However, a certain Kang company exclusively purchased about 150 packages. The spot price of 20-count Tiannv floor yarn is 2,325 yuan, only 40 yuan lower than the previous day. The price of 20-count Yueqin factory orders is 1,770 yuan. The price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 2,200 yuan. Currently, the price difference between spot floor yarn and factory orders is as much as 400-500 yuan.

Large transaction volumes at the Shuangma Exchange are mostly settled using settlement methods, with self-settling occurring frequently.

Real Gold Emerges as Gold Price Continues to Plummet, Breaking Through the 9,000 Yuan Barrier

Yesterday, the cash gold black market continued to decline. The price has fallen below the 9,000 yuan mark. Market sentiment is weak due to the release of real gold by silver houses and pawnshops. Initially, trading was light between 9,400 and 9,500 yuan, with no significant changes. Around 10:30 AM, silver houses suddenly began aggressively selling, selling 50 taels to Chengji at 9,150 yuan. The selling continued, and remittance firms also began to sell off. Although gold certificate firms and Santai were buying, the downward trend continued unabated. At 11:15 AM, the price fell below 9,000 yuan, with a customer selling 10 taels to a gold shop at 8,900 yuan. The final price was 8,950 yuan, a sharp drop of 550 yuan compared to the previous day, and a total drop of 4,880 yuan compared to the afternoon closing price on the 6th. The trading range on the day was 500-600 yuan, with approximately 400 taels traded. The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops initially rose to 1,050 yuan per tael at Datonghang and Xinhang, but then returned to the original price of 1,000 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by 200 yuan. Refined silver was priced at 16 yuan, while the black market price was only 10 yuan, with few buyers.

The discount rate for remittances and bills remained at the flat rate or 5 yuan per thousand.

US Dollar Plummets by 3 Yuan

Yesterday, the US dollar fell to 15.30 yuan and finally settled at around 15.45 yuan, a significant decrease compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were priced at around 3.12 yuan, and military currency at 3.78 yuan.

More US Rice Arrives; The Rice Bureau is in Great Difficulty

The supply of US rice has increased slightly compared to before, with a total of over 300 dan arriving. Due to the large number of street vendors, the asking price has fallen to only 23-24 yuan per dou. As a result, transactions have slowed down, and the market price is difficult to support and continues to decline. Kunshan and other Northern-style rice are selling for only 257-258 yuan, while Bo rice ranges from 251-252 yuan to as low as 245 yuan, a drop of 2-3 yuan to 5-6 yuan compared to before. If the supply continues to increase, the market price of US rice may gradually decrease, which would greatly benefit the people's food supply. Furthermore, the authorities are taking various measures to increase stockpiles, and the panic over rice shortages in Shanghai should be resolved. However, the situation outside the rice shops selling rice from the Rice Bureau is chaotic, with people pushing and shoving, causing immense suffering, which is difficult to describe. It is also reported that the authorities of the two settlements are focusing on the transportation of guest xiàn rice, and there are rumors of Vietnamese rice being imported. Additionally, a previously agreed-upon shipment of 18,000 bags of small twisted rice will be transported to Shanghai by neutral ships. If this becomes a reality, it will be a blessing for the people's food supply.

There is a lack of both buyers and sellers for wheat, and flour transactions are also difficult to finalize. However, bran is selling well, and the market has shown signs of improvement. The opening price for Lan Hua bran in the morning was 54.5 yuan, and San Xin bran was 56 yuan. In the evening market, the asking price for San Xin bran had risen by 3-5 yuan, but there were few buyers. A total of about 700 packages were traded in the market.

Miscellaneous Grains Show Weakness

The trading of miscellaneous grains decreased again yesterday, with only a few scattered transactions. The market is generally weak, with edible oil showing signs of decline. Soybeans continued to fall by 1-2 yuan, and corn fell by another 3-4 yuan. A total of 40 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were sold at 370 yuan, 50 barrels of Jiangbei soybean oil (road cargo) at 360 yuan, 400 cans of raw oil at 350 yuan, 100 dan of Da You factory clear oil at 227 yuan, 150 dan of vegetable oil at 252 yuan, 100 dan of Da Chang new factory vegetable oil at 248 yuan, 300 packages of Tianjin Xin Jinyuan at 92-93 yuan, 200 packages of Horan white corn at 47.00-47.20 yuan, 200 packages of yellow corn at 48 yuan, and 600 packages of Saigon new corn at 49.005 yuan in Puxi and 48.50-47 yuan in Pudong.

Government Bonds Experience Increased Price Decline; All Five Categories Fall Below the 60 Yuan Mark

The government bond market was extremely chaotic yesterday, with most buyers eagerly trying to settle their positions, causing market prices to fall significantly. However, short covering was also quite strong, and some retail investors were buying at low prices. Although the Category E lottery could not be held as scheduled due to environmental reasons and was temporarily postponed, it may be relocated in the future. It is rumored that the relevant authorities have agreed to the rescheduling, but this has not been confirmed. The declining market trend is only a temporary phenomenon. At the opening auction yesterday, Category C opened at 59 yuan. Due to the urgent need for sellers to exit, the next price was 58 yuan, a sharp drop of one yuan. The downward trend intensified thereafter, with the lowest price reaching 55 yuan. Category E opened at 56 yuan, Category A at 61 yuan, and Category B at 57.5 yuan. Subsequently, all five types of government bonds were priced at only 50+ yuan, with none above 60 yuan. There were no transactions for Category D within the market, but it was rumored that transactions outside the market were made at 54 yuan. Although the decline was severe, there were very few transactions. Short covering and bargain hunting were also quite common. There were no rumors regarding the government bonds themselves. The chaos was caused by the previous overcrowding of buyers, leading to this unnecessary panic. Securities brokers are temporarily closing the market starting today to sort out accounts. The market will be closed for the New Year and the bank's winter solstice holiday tomorrow and the day after. The market price results are listed in a simple table below. The transaction volume was only 200,000-300,000 yuan.

There Have Been No Transactions for Chinese Stocks in Several Days, but Some Trading of Various Stocks Has Occurred Outside the Market. It is Reported that Huidefeng Traded at 63 Yuan, Yihua Yarn Factory at 30 Yuan, and Paper Industry at 6 Yuan.

High Price of Red Rice

The supply of red rice has been blocked for a long time, and the market has been out of stock for many days. It is recently rumored that the price in Shanghai is quite high, so dozens of packages have been transported, which have been purchased by customer groups, and the higher price is 1,800-1,900 yuan, and then it is reduced accordingly.

Shuidong Branches are Running Out

This year's new Shuidong branch goods have been poorly harvested, and there are no arrivals. They only rely on the existing cold storage goods in the market to meet sales, and the supply is gradually becoming scarce, so although sales are small, the price is still stable. A little trading opened in yesterday's market, but the original disk remained unchanged.

Orchid Rice Shortage Triggers Price Increase Black Fungus Sales Are Mostly Blocked

Due to the blockage of sources, orchid rice has recently lacked replenishment, and the stock on the market is also small, and high-quality goods are particularly scarce. The inventory of the trade also belongs to few, so the selling price has risen by more than 50 yards, and it is not easy to turn loose for a while. Black fungus used to be high above the 2,000 yuan mark due to the shortage of arrivals and inventory. Recently, after the situation changed, there were many obstacles to going, and the price has fallen frequently. The current market price of higher-quality goods has been over 1,550 yuan, and the price of postal package ears is 1,400-1,300 yuan.

Tea (8) Gao Jiannong

In the year 1601 AD, the emerging nation of the Netherlands also established the East India Company to engage in trade with the East. Four years later, they came from Java to Macau, China to sell tea for export to Europe. According to other records, in 1615 AD, the report of Wickham, the agent of the British East India Company, had already mentioned the item of tea. However, it was the Dutch who first transported tea to London. Soon after, the custom of drinking tea became very popular among Europeans, especially the Dutch and the British. However, it also met with fierce opposition. For example, a famous French Parisian doctor named Patin publicly declared in 1648 AD that "tea is the latest bad habit of modern times." However, despite his opposition, the power of tea continued to rise and swept through all countries and classes of society. What is most strange is the sudden change in the attitude of the French. Before, they had scolded tea so harshly, but soon - in 1657 AD - they praised it to the extreme, calling it a "sacred herb."

Drinking tea quickly became a habit of people in various European countries, especially the British. Therefore, they came to China in large quantities to purchase it. China also used it and silk as the most effective weapons to balance the influx of foreign goods. However, seeing that the sales of tea were so good and the profits were so great, merchants from Britain, the Netherlands, and other countries tried to cultivate tea on the colonies they had seized. As a result, tea was introduced to Madeira and the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean at the end of the 18th century, and to Brazil in 1812. As for the tea planting in Assam, India, it only began around 1840. The cultivation of Ceylon birds was even later, probably around 1880. At this time, the coffee trees on the island of Ceylon were completely destroyed by an orchid invasion. The magnificent John immediatly changed to tea trees, and they were so diligent that in just two or thirty years, they opened up 160,000 acres of tea land. Now, Indian tea is promoted through advertisements and anti-propaganda against Chinese tea, almost completely seizing the market of Chinese tea in the world. China's tea exports have always been the leader in the world, but since 1900 - the memorable year of Gengzi - it has permanently retreated to the first place.

The Dutch began planting tea in the South Sea Islands at the beginning of the 19th century. However, they worked hard to conduct analytical research in the laboratory. The chemical composition of tea was mostly understood through their work. According to recent statistics, the tea exports of these few small islands sometimes even exceed those of China! This is such a sad and shameful thing, and how should China work hard to regain this lost right and glory?

Finally, we know that the stimulant contained in tea was originally called "tea essence." Later, people found out that it was actually the same thing as "caffeine," so some people advocate canceling the term tea essence and only using the word caffeine. Moreover, for the same weight, tea leaves contain about 3.3 to 5 percent caffeine, while coffee only contains 1.3 to 10.3 percent, so the stimulating power of tea is almost twice that of coffee. Especially where its advantages lie, it is not as easy to cause "insomnia" as coffee does - a terrible disease for those who use their brains. So my conclusion is to contain coffee and advocate drinking tea.

Spring and Autumn Bread Problems Liao Ran

In recent days, the bread problem has become a big issue again. As a commoner, I have a deep sigh of feeling of old rice, so why is it strange that I cannot buy bread? In fact, there is no need to panic about bread. The authorities have long focused on "family bread" and have maintained it with great effort. The regrettable thing is that rice and grains have caused a rush in the market, and flour has also been rushed along with it. Therefore, everyone wants to buy flour, and flour is now in short supply.

First of all, the sesame cake is held in hand, with a lot of "floating desire immortal" meaning; but this time it makes the sesame cake division unable to start, so that the flour has a small hardship like a thread. However, noodle shops - especially sesame cake shops - cannot be closed for a long time, and the authorities' careful statement is that they can provide an appropriate amount of flour.

The sesame cake continues to be bitten deliciously in the hands of the coolies, and a large group of higher-ranking Chinese people in the style of Qiren do not need to gather on Nanjing Road to participate in the "flat buying" bread line. Even if the butter chocolate white soft bread is temporarily "cleared", steamed radish yellow onion cake (or small cake) may be prepared one or two, accompanied by a country velvet soup, also is the intention of commemorating the equality of our Lord Jesus on Christmas.

In fact, my Buddha Tathagata has already been equal, and some men and women beggars often recite Amitabha Buddha behind people's backs, asking the young master and miss to give a sesame cake money, which scared one of my "friends", because the price of the sesame cake is also almost as good as bread. "My friend" has no stomach problems, but in addition to eating West rice, not to mention butter bread, even sesame cake is also among the higher-ranking leisure food. The market refuses to sell vanilla sandwich biscuits, which seems to have nothing to do with my friend", but this has further affected his "a solution of benevolence".

So the loafers and beggars flowed some more yellow water.

Then, bread buyers are always wary, even after successfully participating in the flat trade of bread, they also have to carry it home by hand, which is a good practice for "opportunists" - the author and another "my friend" passed by the New Bridge and glimpsed a wonderful empty-handed child killing from the side, trying to snatch a bag of biscuits from a girl in a gray coat, but it was a miss; this empty-handed child did not do anything, but rested on the target and calmly competed with the girl, forming a stalemate. The girl finally gave up the paper bag, and the empty-handed child turned around and smiled bitterly and walked away. "You killer, smelly sores three" but what's the use? This is Xiao Dongdao.

Hugo's "Les Miserables" writes about a man who was sentenced to a short term of imprisonment for stealing bread for his child, and escaped from prison, adding a few more years; and repeatedly escaped from prison, and was sentenced to nineteen years.

But this is a novel, and there seems to be warmth and human nature in the real world, and the clowns who sneak a sheep "lose the wind" but are full of one or two old punches. However, people who have not tasted bread for a long time still eat the north wind, and I will see that someone will eventually not bear to lower this "spicy hand" Kerr.

The poem says: "Enough is enough for the rich, alas this lonely", and the wind and rain, why is there an extreme?

Frozen Corpses on the Road Tu Tu

As the winter solstice approaches, although the climate has been a little abnormal these days, like the winter in the South, the frozen corpses on the roadside are already a common sight. According to the reports of the co-workers Fuyuantang and Pu Zhuang, there are dozens of them every day. There are still many others that have not been collected and are in remote areas. This is truly a tragic scene in the world.

Most of the frozen corpses are itch-sans and beggars. Many of them take risks when they cannot beg for food. The rest of the beggars who do not have enough physical strength or are timid and weak have to go hungry. They have nowhere to live at night, and they have to sleep on the streets, subject to the ravages of wind and rain, the dampness of the water door tin, and the lack of clothes and bedding to cover their bodies. Although it is not yet severe winter, a large number of frozen corpses have already been found.

The Public Works Bureau once had a plan to cooperate with the Salvation Army to establish a large-scale beggar shelter in the western suburbs, but it was aborted. Now, there is only one similar shelter on Singapore Road, but because of its narrow location and insufficient funding, it cannot expand its capacity, and it still cannot solve the current serious beggar problem. Human nature is inherently good, and the desire to survive is urgent. Although beggars are in trouble, if they can be well-educated and accommodated, it should not be difficult to make them useful people. Moreover, this matter is closely related to social security and appearance. The severe winter with piercing north winds is approaching, and the situation of frozen corpses on the road will inevitably increase sharply. I hope that the authorities will consider this matter in addition to good strategies such as managing rice and coal.

Begonia Qin Shouou

Fifteen Dad, let's go busking!

But one evening, something small and fortunate finally happened.

At about ten o'clock, the four of them were walking out of the No. 9 private room of the Shou Ronghua Sichuan Restaurant, and everyone felt very happy in their hearts, because a very young guest paid ten yuan for listening to a section of the play, and he was not fussy at all, and did not ask any questions; Qiu Haitang and the Han family thanked him three or four times in a row, but Mei Bao herself clearly felt that this student-like young man had secretly looked at her a few times with the shyness that is common to young men.

"Wait a minute, the guests in No. 8 next door also want to call you in!" A waiter called them back when they arrived in the hallway.

Of course, there is no reason to refuse business! But as soon as she stepped in the door, Mei Bao regretted it a little, because the two guests in this private room were already a little drunk. They were about thirty years old, and they wore suits more elaborately than real foreigners, but the colors and styles were too fancy, which made people think at first glance that the other party was two twentieth-century playboys.

"What a coincidence, Little Li, they are also two!" The first to speak was a small fat man with a greasy head, a pair of eyes full of evil intentions, only circling on the faces of Mei Bao and the Han family girl.

"Don't talk nonsense, pick a good one and sing a section first!" The drunkest guy said, while he also turned his face and said to the small fat man with a greasy head who was looking at Mei Bao with rapture: "Hello, Charlie, right? ......"

The small fat man nodded hazily, his eyes still fixed on Mei Bao.

"Let the Han family girl sing a section of Fenhe Bay first!" Qiu Haitang began to pull the erhu with a livid face.

While the Han family girl was singing, these two guests didn't listen at all, they just looked at Mei Bao with a silly smile, and also used very vulgar Shanghai slang, mixed with English, as if they had already gone mad. (286)

First Prize Qin Ren

At the restaurant table, a charity lottery salesman said to a man who was burying his head in his meal.

"Guangsheng, buy a lottery ticket!"

The man eating didn't even lift his head and asked, "How many dan of white rice is the first prize?"

"Bread Industry" Wu Wei

Family bread is still something, popular in the French Concession (Albert Road, Lafayette Road) zone, Russians eating family bread is like us eating foreign xiàn rice, although it is the same can fill the stomach, after all, it is not as clean and soft as the American-style bread, or the hard, loose, fragrant and brittle French-style bread.

These days, the sales of bread are extraordinarily high, and if you get up late in the morning, don't even think about eating toast, let alone a sandwich; in order to "develop the old and have something to do", I ran to a certain large company on Nanjing Road just after eleven o'clock yesterday morning, wanting to buy a whole "orthodox" bread from Sullivan or Yili, who knew that looking at the bread cabinet, it was already empty. The few sparkling and bright pieces of glass, shining under the fluorescent lights, were especially exposed and terrible. Just as I was about to turn back, the enthusiastic shop assistant pointed to another glass shelf and asked me "Would you like to"?

I took a closer look and found that there were ten or so breads that looked like half a small watermelon. The outside was neither wrapped in color-printed wax paper, nor were they decorated with raisins, frosting, or fruit jam-like things. They were simply naked, lying horizontally and vertically on the glass shelf. Could it be "family bread"! A flash of inspiration, I asked the shop assistant.

Then I asked her about the news of "non-family bread" and how to buy it so that I wouldn't be disappointed.

The conclusion of the conversation: to buy any style of bread, the first thing is to be early, the earlier the better. Early... early... early... "The company opens the door, and buy the bread", this is an invaluable secret recipe. It is said that in the first hour or two in the morning, a dozen or so American-style breads have already been sold, and a hundred family breads are empty in an instant.

I spent one yuan and five cents and exchanged it for a quaint and lovely family bread; the outside was covered with a wrapping paper from a certain large company, and it felt very "decent" in my hand, and the content was also substantial and pleasing. I ran back at a leisurely pace, and in the display window of a certain tea room, I saw seven or eight small red wood ornaments on the shelf. Although there was nothing on them, a clear impression had already emerged in my mind: in an instant, things like curry chicken buns... rose corners... malay cake appeared before my eyes.

I didn't dare to let my imagination run wild any further, and strode forward, tightly holding the family bread in my hand. However, I think there may be such a day: the selling price will be like the current winter solstice dishes, divided into fifty yuan, two yuan and twenty yuan... bar.

News Sketch

Freezing Cold and Plundering Jin Yi

At the entrance of this damp and dirty alley, there is now a base camp for a group of vagrants. During the day, they "catch treasures" in the sun; at night, they sleep on the walls with posters torn down as bedding. Of course, in addition to sleeping, a person also needs to get something to put into the belly to prevent the stomach from starving and flushing the clear water back up. They are also people, and they always know to reach out and open their mouths to eat when their skin is starving, so when they see young girls passing through their cordon, they stick their dirty bodies up, which is to say a few fewer good deeds of "begging", and the girls will not be stingy with five cents or a dime for the sake of cleanliness and maintaining dignity. However, this kind of "targeting" is not "accessible to the four seas" on this road. In fact, ordinary passers-by shake their heads and slip away like a fish.

In fact, getting money is still used to buy baked sweet potatoes or pot cakes. For the sake of convenience and practicality, it is better to directly plunder food than to chant "begging", and perhaps when the time comes, you can get this one yuan corner of Sullivan bread or a currant cake. By coincidence, when these "searching for lice and talking" friends were planning perfectly, a three-wheeled delivery bicycle stopped next to the "cordon", and the Flying Tiger brand paint on the car box clearly marked the Cookie Company logo. Isn't the taste of butter bread drooling?

A young man who seemed to have sung on the "open-air stage" started to make trouble, shouting "Freezing cold and plundering", summoning his crowd. Many legs faced one goal, many hands faced one goal. The two hands and two legs of the shop clerk were truly surrounded on all sides and sung on all sides. If they were to be captured alive, the bread would be lost. If they were to protect the bread, the prisoners would escape, although their fists would also make a sound with their backs, but: the bread was robbed, and the murderers escaped and were lucky.

While chewing the aftertaste of bread in the sun, the commander-in-chief announced the day's battle records as follows:

Everyone's belly is full, and everyone is punched twice on average. After offsetting the income and expenditure, we returned triumphantly!

The Inventor of the Smallest Invention San San

Zorden Billman of New York State is the world's youngest inventor. He invented a very clever hanger that doubles the normal amount of storage. He was only seven years old when he filed the patent application. At his ninth birthday party, he happily took out his patent certificate No. 206828 and showed it to his relatives and friends!

Supplementary Notes on the Change of Time in the Performing Arts World Xiao Man

Yesterday, I read Wang Qijun's article "Discussion on the Change of Time in Theaters," which contained many constructive suggestions for Peking Opera theaters and movie theaters. However, regarding the allocation of time, I feel that there are still some small imperfections. In addition, theaters for spoken drama, Yue opera, Shanghai opera, etc. were not mentioned. I will add some more supplements:

Among the theaters that perform Peking Opera, only Golden currently practices the 2:00 to 8:00 PM schedule. Others, such as Grand Theater, Gong Theater, Tianchan, and Updating, all start at 6:00 PM. The closing time varies from theater to theater. Updating and Tianchan perform until 10:00 PM, while Grand Theater and Gong Theater perform until 10:30 PM. The daytime shows at Tianchan, Grand Theater, and Gong Theater are from 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and at Updating, they are from 1:00 PM to 5:30 PM. I think that if the goal is to save electricity, the 2:00 to 8:00 PM principle of Golden can be preserved, but as Wang Qijun said, it is really necessary to discuss performing from daytime to nighttime. However, Wang Qijun's proposal of 1:00 to 6:00 PM for the convenience of audience transportation and meal times is actually quite difficult to implement. The theater authorities, in order to attract audiences who are currently severely threatened by the cost of living, have no choice but to add more shows to compensate. Therefore, even though they only perform for four and a half hours on weekdays, they now have to perform for six hours. Of course, closing at 8:00 PM is very problematic for dinner, but if they only perform for four and a half hours like on weekdays, or five hours as proposed by Wang Qijun, the business may be affected. Therefore, my opinion is that it is best to perform from 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM, because the dinner time for the general audience in Shanghai is mostly around 7:00 PM, so dinner is not a problem. The only problem is transportation, but although buses have stopped running (only in the Public Concession), there are still trams to take, and you can also walk. I think the audience will definitely like to watch an extra hour of the show. At the same time, who knows if buses will soon shorten their operating hours or even stop running altogether! As for adding daytime shows on holidays, the time is quite difficult to allocate, because if each theater implements the 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM schedule every day, then it cannot be said that they are adding daytime shows on holidays, but only adding nighttime shows. The time for this nighttime show becomes a problem. On the one hand, they want to save electricity and close early, and on the other hand, they have to consider the audience's dinner time and the length of the shows - undoubtedly, this is also a basic factor in attracting audiences. Unfortunately, the most suitable time would be from 6:00 PM to 10:30 PM for the nighttime show and from 12:30 PM to 5:30 PM for the daytime show.

Movie showtimes can only be three per day: 1:30 PM, 4:00 PM, and 7:30 PM, with an additional early show at 9:30 AM on Sundays.

Spoken drama showtimes usually take about three hours. Currently, the day and night shows at various theaters, 2:30 PM and 7:30 PM, are very suitable for the environment. If possible, the daytime show can be brought forward to 2:00 PM, but there may be difficulties in bringing the nighttime show forward to 7:00 PM, because the audience of spoken drama must watch from the first act, unlike Peking Opera, which has a special highlight show.

Yue Opera can start its daytime show from 1:00 PM in the afternoon, but the nighttime show starting at 6:00 PM will inevitably conflict with the audience's dinner time. It is best to postpone it a little so that the audience can have a leisurely dinner.

Shanghai Opera has two shows a day: 2:30 PM and 7:00 PM. This is my humble opinion. I wonder what the theater authorities think?

### Transfer of Property Rights Procedures: Japanese Statement

Explanations Regarding Shen Bao's Materials Also Provided

Yesterday, the Japanese authorities issued a statement saying that due to numerous inquiries from various parties regarding the interrelationship between the following proclamations: "Proclamation of the Shanghai Area Japan Naval and Military Supreme Command of December 8 Regarding the Transfer of Enemy Nation Real Estate," "Proclamation of the Shanghai Area Japan Naval and Military Supreme Command of December 17 Regarding the Transfer of Enemy Nation Personal Property," and "Proclamation of December 17 Regarding the Reporting of Important Materials," the Japanese authorities are now providing further clarification of their relationship as follows:

The former two relate to real estate or specific personal property that previously or currently belonged to enemy nations, public enemy entities, enemy companies, or enemy persons. It is entirely irrelevant what the nationality of the person to whom the goods or properties belonged is.

(A) The purpose of the former two is, on the one hand, to prohibit in principle the transfer of enemy nation public or private specific (listed in the appendix) personal and real property after December 8. On the other hand, in light of the fact that there were many malicious actors involved in the transfer of enemy nation public or private personal and real property in China after the implementation date of the freezing order (i.e., July 26), not only transfers after December 8, but also transfers of enemy nation public or private real property and specific personal property, or changes in other rights, that took place after July 26 require that if someone other than an enemy person has acquired legitimate rights in good faith and wishes to ensure these legitimate rights, they must submit proof documents (i.e., the contract, payment receipt, land deed, or any other document deemed capable of proving ownership) in one original and five copies to the Japanese Consulate General at 106 Huangpu Road. If the above documents are not submitted, the transfer and change will be deemed invalid.

Regarding the personal property that requires the above procedures, the Japanese authorities have provisionally limited it in the Proclamation on the Transfer of Enemy Nation Personal Property issued on December 17 to the specific items listed in the appendix to that proclamation. However, regarding personal property not listed in the appendix, if someone who is not an enemy person wishes to confirm their rights, the Japanese authorities hope that they will report it in the same manner as above.

However, one point must be noted: if the submitted proof documents are deemed insufficient or unsatisfactory, the transfer or change will naturally be deemed invalid. Furthermore, for the convenience of those who have not submitted such proof documents, the Japanese authorities have specially extended the reporting deadline to the 27th of this month.

(B) The intention of the Proclamation on Reporting Important Materials was clarified in a statement issued by the Army and Navy Press Department on December 19. Its purpose is to understand the location of all important materials in the Shanghai area so that they can be handled in the most effective and appropriate manner. To achieve this goal, if someone possesses such materials and their quantity or price exceeds the minimum reporting standard specified in the appendix to that proclamation, regardless of whether they are enemy nation public or private property or purely owned by third-country nationals or Chinese people, they must be registered uniformly. When reporting, they should be submitted to the Temporary Branch Office of the Yokohama Specie Bank Building at 24 The Bund.

Regarding the minimum quantity or price of materials that must be registered according to the above proclamation, many people have asked the Japanese authorities. Here is an example to explain: even if there is only one car, it must be registered. That is, if the material exceeds the minimum reporting price or quantity specified in the appendix, or if its quantity or price meets the minimum standard specified in the appendix, it must be registered uniformly.

### Hongkou Tram Resumes Service This Morning

Tram service in Hongkou is scheduled to resume this morning. It will initially run from the Waibaidu Bridge to Yokohama Bridge for one cent (this is the Hongkou section of the former Route 11 tram). Seven trams are prepared to be released first, departing from the Tilanqiao depot at 6:00 AM and returning to the depot at 10:00 PM to stop service. Fifty former Hongkou bus drivers have been transferred to the tram company for training in tram operation techniques. Because they are not yet fully proficient, fifteen tram drivers have been temporarily borrowed from the tram company. These drivers will initially operate the trams within the Hongkou area. Female ticket sellers from the Hongkou bus company will be used as ticket collectors. The section from Waibaidu Bridge to Yangshupu will be delayed for two or three days due to repairs to the tracks and electrical wires, and the installation of various necessary facilities. A total of twenty trams will be released on both lines in the future. If the drivers' training is not yet complete, drivers will continue to be borrowed from the tram company temporarily to provide experienced staff.

Banking Industry Completes Year-End Closing, Urges Repayment of Mortgage Loans, Pledged Goods Mostly Food and Flour, Issue of Foreigner Salaries for Christmas Not Resolved

Since the banks in this city began handling year-end interest closing matters the day before yesterday, they have been extending internal office hours for consecutive days, from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM daily. Currently, the savings portion is limited to being settled today. The commercial portion will begin tomorrow. Each major bank will further extend internal office hours to 5:00 PM starting tomorrow (the 25th) to ensure that all final accounts can be completed before the 31st and be closed on New Year's Day. Money shops generally operate similarly. Regarding matured mortgage loans, they are being urged for repayment as much as possible and are not being rolled over temporarily.

### Most Money Shop Pledges are Food

The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were still open as usual yesterday from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, but withdrawals by depositors are still temporarily suspended due to the need to organize internally. Regarding the goods pledged to money shops that were reported the day before yesterday, it is heard that the most common types and quantities are food and flour. Apart from the Chinese banks being gathered and forwarded by the temporary joint association of money shops, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Central Bank of China report themselves and do not go through the association.

Christmas Salaries Not Yet Resolved

The question of whether British and American firms in Shanghai can resume paying their employees' salaries in cash before Christmas morning has still not been resolved, as payment in cash

Requires Payment Approval

Requires approval from the Japanese supervisor of the paying bank. Many British and American firms applying for funds to immediately issue subsidies and the second half of December's salaries have been rejected. HSBC has announced a new method to facilitate British and American firms applying for sustenance funds. However, to what extent these applications will be approved remains to be seen in the future.

Checks Not Yet in General Use

Although HSBC can now accept checks from depositors drawing from banks in the Japanese Axis countries and neutral countries and transfer them through the Yokohama Specie Bank, HSBC is not yet able to accept checks from depositors of British, American, and Dutch banks, and HSBC's own checks are also in this category. Yesterday morning, there were very few depositors going to foreign banks to wait to withdraw funds. Shortly after the banks opened, there were no longer any people seen waiting to withdraw funds. Generally speaking, current cash payments are handled in the same way as last week, but some smaller banks have had to suspend cash payments due to a lack of cash.

### Japanese Military Spokesman Convenes Meeting with Foreign Nationals

Providing Convenience for the Lives of British and American Nationals, Actively Cooperating in Commodity and Banking Transactions

According to the Shanghai Times, Lieutenant Matsuda of the Shanghai Japanese Army Press Department, representing the Japanese authorities, convened a meeting with British and American nationals residing in Shanghai at the Metropole Hotel at 2:35 PM yesterday (the 22nd) to listen to their "wishes, difficulties, and personal problems" after the Japanese military entered the concessions and to find ways to resolve them. The meeting concluded at 5:00 PM.

Explaining Difficulties

More than 250 British and American nationals attended the meeting. No fewer than 15 people expressed their opinions and explained their difficulties. At the end, Matsuda spoke, stating in brief, "If British and American nationals in this city refrain from actions that harm the true intent of the Japanese side's operations, and if British and Americans continue to treat Japanese nationals in their territories with preferential treatment, then the Japanese authorities will grant you the greatest possible freedom and pleasant life within the possible scope. You will undoubtedly encounter difficulties due to the Pacific War. However, the Japanese side has no hatred or personal animosity towards you. Therefore, this war is between nations, not between individuals." The spokesman also warned those present to absolutely refrain from engaging in communist activities.

Relief for Foreign Nationals

Matsuda held a meeting of the same nature at the Metropole Hotel on the 1st of this month, so yesterday's meeting was the second. First, Mr. Kerlai, the chairman of the British Foreign National Association, delivered a speech, expressing his gratitude in concise terms for the preferential treatment received by British nationals and revealing that he is working with Mr. Andersen, the chairman of the American Foreign National Association, to find ways to alleviate the difficulties of British and American nationals, and that the Japanese Consulate General has been actively cooperating with the banking transactions needed to provide relief to foreign nationals. Andersen continued to speak, stating in brief that the American Foreign National Association has formulated a plan to provide relief to foreign nationals. There are currently about two hundred American and Philippine nationals who are destitute, and the American Foreign National Association is currently trying to provide them with food and lodging.

Warehouse Inventory

Mr. Ekersson, the manager of Eli Lilly, called out for those who need liver extract and other medicines and asked if the company could transport these drugs out of some warehouses in the International Settlement. Matsuda agreed to submit this matter to the Japanese military commander. However, Mr. Johnson of the Sterling Electric Company also raised the same question, saying that the company is currently unable to carry out repair work because it cannot transport motors out of the warehouses in the Western District. Matsuda also responded to a question from Mr. Doner of the Pentecostal Church, saying that British and American clergy can participate in services and preach in Chinese churches here, but they cannot make any political remarks or engage in political activities.

Foreign Nationals in the Interior

Someone asked if the Japanese authorities could guarantee the safety of British and American nationals coming to Shanghai from the interior of China in the current turbulent situation, and that the safety of travel could not be ensured. Mr. Gore of Henry Waugh asked if the goods in the company's warehouses, mostly American cigarettes, could be transported out for sale. The spokesman replied that the Japanese side is currently studying steps regarding the removal or sale of British and American goods from warehouses in order to restore the normal state of various trades in the city. The Japanese authorities will not confiscate other items except for "enemy" goods.

Relocation Not Allowed

Then Dr. Openg asked the Japanese authorities in a humorous tone if they could find a way to allow his customers to withdraw money from the bank to pay for medical expenses. Also, a British national asked if they could relocate. Matsuda replied that changes of address are not allowed, because if many foreign nationals apply to relocate, the Japanese registration office will have complicated procedures and will be overwhelmed. It is heard that yesterday's meeting was the last one. In the future, British and American nationals can submit their questions to the Foreign National Association and inquire with the Japanese authorities.

### 650 Cars Approved for Operation

Unauthorized Use Not Allowed, Car Licenses Lost 4 Million Yuan

The car ban has been in effect since 9:00 AM yesterday. The issuance of operating permits by the Public Works Department is quite strict. There were approximately 1,500 applications to continue operating cars, but only 650 were approved by the Public Works Department. The remaining tens of thousands of private cars are all out of service. Those who have been applying to the Public Works Department Vehicle Affairs Office and the French Police Department in recent days are mostly doctors, those with important matters, and vehicles of public institutions. Vehicles that have been approved to continue operating have special permits affixed to the car windows and can only be used during office hours. At the same time, the French Public Works Department has issued a notice ordering all cars, whether they continue to operate or not, to register with the Public Works Department Price Management Office at 2 Fuxing Road. The loss of car licenses is estimated to be as high as 4 million yuan, including approximately 2 million yuan in private car license fees and approximately 2 million yuan in business car, truck, and driver's license fees. This amount will be compensated by increasing other vehicle license fees. It is now heard that bicycle license fees are more than 80 yuan per month per vehicle, and rickshaw license fees are more than 20 yuan per month.

### Closing Time for Entertainment Venues During Festivals

Public Works Department Notice: Regarding the closing time of public places such as taverns, restaurants, hotels, and dance halls during special festivals, including December 24, 25, 26, New Year's Eve, and New Year's Day, which was previously stipulated by this department's Notice No. 3926 to be 4:00 AM, this regulation has now been revised. Hereafter, the closing time of such venues during special festivals shall be limited to 2:00 AM.

### Police Authorities Inquire About Mr. Guo Yun-guan's Address

The Shanghai International Settlement police authorities now wish to contact Mr. Guo Yun-guan, President of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, and Mr. Zha Liang-jian, Chief Clerk of the court, and hope to ascertain the current addresses of Mr. Guo and Mr. Zha. Anyone who ascertains and reports the address to the nearest police station will be given a reward of 1,000 yuan.

### Those Needing Insulin Can Apply for Review

Those who need insulin can submit a written document from a registered physician stating the daily dosage in units to Office No. 22 of the Public Works Department Health Department for review between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM on Saturday, the 27th of this month.

### Posthumous Award of Medal of Honor for French Police Inspector Who Died in the Line of Duty

Mr. Darlan, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, has ordered that a Medal of Honor be posthumously awarded to the late Mr. Laudinan, the French Police Inspector. Mr. Darlan sent a message to Mr. Majorile, the French Consul General in Shanghai, stating in brief that Mr. Laudinan, the Deputy Inspector of the Shanghai French Police Department, died in the line of duty in a struggle with terrorists on October 15 of this year. He is hereby posthumously awarded a Medal of Honor to express his loyalty and bravery.

### Salvation Army Holds Christmas Party for Poor Children, Distributes Joy Flags, and Gives Away Broken Wheat

According to Mr. Walker, the leader of the Salvation Army, the Salvation Army has decided to carry out five activities during Christmas to bring joy to thousands of poor people in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, so that everyone can celebrate Christmas. The plan is to choose four locations in the city to hold Christmas celebration rallies in the next three days, aiming to have approximately 4,000 poor Chinese children participate. At that time, there will be concerts, joy flags distributed, and sweets, peanuts, watermelon seeds, and other foods that children love will be given away. The 560 beggars in the Salvation Army's beggar shelter on Hart Road and Singapore Road will also have concerts and joy flags distributed on Christmas Day. The Salvation Army's Westerners' dormitory will hold banquets and various games, and the Westerners' shelter will also have a special sumptuous dinner on Christmas Eve. In addition, the Salvation Army plans to distribute broken wheat flour to 150 poor Chinese families, 25 pounds per family.

### Younger Brother's Fratricide Case to be Sentenced Today

The sensational case of Xu Song-yao, the young owner of the Hua Mei Pharmacy, being brutally murdered by his younger brother has been repeatedly questioned. Because the defendant, Xu Da-quan, pretended to be insane, no confession could be obtained, so a verdict has not yet been reached. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the father was brought to court for questioning. There was still a large crowd of onlookers. After the court session began, the investigating officer first submitted a

Photo as Evidence

The photograph was a small picture of a man and a woman, one foot two inches in size. When Xu Xiang-sun was asked who was in the picture, he confessed that the man was the defendant Da-quan and the woman was the defendant's wife, Zhang Cui-e. The two had fallen in love and, after the parents agreed, became engaged on July 26 of this year. They had planned to get married on February 22 of next spring. The court, after hearing the confession, stated, "Your confession is true. This alone proves that the defendant does not have a mental illness; otherwise, he would not have fallen in love freely, and the woman would not want to marry a husband suffering from mental illness." Xu was speechless. Then

Witnesses Questioned

The French doctor, Wang Guo-an, confessed that on October [blank] at 10:00 AM, after arriving at the small ward to examine the body, he went to the Tongren Fu Yuan Branch Hall at 11:00 AM to examine the body. At that time, he examined a total of six bodies, one of whom was well-dressed with a bloody head wound, seemingly due to a fall that had caused his death, which Xu Xiang-sun had collected. According to Zhu Jin-fu, the worker at the mortuary who specializes in serving the dead, he took the body to Baojiang Hospital by bicycle corpse cart on the same day. At that time, the investigating officer, Lu Zan-yuan, instructed him to return first. The body was then immediately delivered, so he returned first. Then the court questioned Xu Kai-tao, the 177th police detective of the French Police Department, who confessed that at 8:00 PM that night, he received a telephone report that someone had fallen to their death and immediately dispatched [blank] of the 19th [blank],

Detective to Investigate

He then brought Xu Xiang-sun and his daughter, because [blank]'s detective could not read, so 193 wrote the report for him, and Xu Xiang-sun filled out the exemption form. At this point, the police lawyer stood up [blank] and stated that the case had previously charged Xu Da-quan with the crime of injury resulting in death under Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and that now it must be changed to the charge of murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the same law. The other defendants were charged with dereliction of duty and destruction of evidence. After the court questioned them one by one, the prosecutor and others stated their opinions and announced the end of the debate. The sentence was scheduled for 1:00 PM today (the 24th).

### Public Works Department Urges Registration of Coal Usage by Factories

All factories within the International Settlement that need coal to manufacture products and have not yet registered their coal requirements with the Public Works Department should register with Office No. 330 of the Public Works Department before the 27th of this month. Late reports will not be accepted.

### Dutch Ship Tjisadane Safely Arrives in Surabaya, Dutch East Indies

The Dutch ship Tjisadane of the Java Company, [blank] carrying [blank] many Western women and children and a small number of key foreign nationals from Shanghai, sailed from Shanghai on November 30, one week before the outbreak of the Pacific War. According to reliable sources, the passengers on the ship have all safely arrived in Surabaya, Dutch East Indies.

### Overstated Shipping Costs for Exported Prayer Beads

The Nanjing [blank] Shi Li Hua Ke [blank] Company previously had a batch of prayer beads that they wanted to ship abroad and entrusted Henry Waugh & Co., located at 120 Jiangxi Road, to handle the customs declaration. Unexpectedly, Gu You-cheng, an employee in the export department of the company, colluded secretly with Li Wei [blank], an employee of the company, to inflate the water freight fee by 600 yuan in the accounts, which the two divided and used. The matter was discovered by a Westerner, Mr. Gor Ting, of Henry Waugh & Co., who reported it to the General Patrol Room and ordered detectives to arrest and detain Gu You-cheng. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fifth Criminal Division of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Qian Xun-jiu filed a lawsuit according to the law. When questioned, the defendant confessed without hesitation and hired a lawyer [blank] to appear in court and requested bail. The presiding judge instructed that Gu You-cheng be allowed to post bail of 600 yuan and wait for a review in seven days.

### The Fate of Chinese Employees in Foreign Firms

—Wei Ge

Foreign firms have deep-rooted foundations within the concessions, concentrated along the Bund east of Henan Road, where tall buildings and foreign-owned companies stand, forming a district. The most prominent are British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, and Andersen, Meyer & Co.; American firms such as Standard Oil, Asiatic Petroleum, and Shewan, Tomes & Co.; and German firms such as Carlowitz & Co., Melchers & Co., and Kunst & Albers, all of which employ hundreds to thousands of people. They are large in scale and operate mainly in import and export trade. Some also operate ships and deal in munitions, while a portion specializes in kerosene and tobacco. These merchants have greatly influenced the progress of China's history. Material civilization has relied on them as intermediaries, and resource outflow has also been achieved by them. After December 8, the situation changed drastically. The arrival of the foreign firms in China came to an end at this point.

Chinese employees working in foreign firms are collectively known as "foreign firm Chinese employees," totaling no fewer than hundreds of thousands of people. Previously, customs was called the "golden rice bowl," postal service was called the "silver rice bowl," and foreign firms ranked third, especially in the eyes of people from the interior. Working in foreign firms was tantamount to being an official in Beijing in the past, and it was unanimously considered a top-tier occupation. The "comprador system" and the "comprador class" are well-known terms. The so-called "comprador" was the Chinese manager in the foreign firm who advanced funds, seemingly a special figure. As for general staff members, the highest position was "big clerk." Foreign firms did not work on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. They had regular holidays on Chinese and foreign festivals and during the spring and autumn horse racing seasons. Office hours were invariably from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, with only German firms having slightly longer business hours. Salaries and benefits were better than in general businesses. However, junior clerks were also very poor. Although many wore suits and leather shoes, they were mostly outwardly strong but inwardly weak.

Currently, the businesses of British and American firms have mostly come to a standstill, and the future of Chinese employees is precarious. Some firms have already announced dismissals and layoffs. I once chatted with several Chinese employees of foreign firms and learned the general outline of the current situation. Larger British and American firms, although in a state of semi-shutdown, still require all employees to go to work every day. Very few can expect to receive their salaries as usual, and most are having their salaries reduced. Whether their work continues depends entirely on the fate of the foreign firms themselves, and the need for personnel is also a determining factor. Most Chinese employees cannot predict their own future and express pessimism. At a time when the cost of living is soaring, the unemployment of hundreds of thousands of people is indeed a serious and unfortunate social problem. German foreign firms are not affected by the current situation. For example, the dye giant BASF is still operating as usual, and its inventory is quite abundant. However, it has already implemented one round of layoffs, so the situation is better than that of British and American firms. A small number of foreign firms from defeated European countries, such as Czechoslovakia, have not closed down, but it is heard that the British and American remittances they rely on have now been cut off, and the number of Chinese employees they hire has been reduced to the lowest possible level.

Chinese employees of foreign firms used to be very common in Shanghai social activities and banquets. After this turmoil, those who only rely on their salaries to maintain their lives will probably not be as active as before.
