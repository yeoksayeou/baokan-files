Hata Shunroku Reappointed Commander-in-Chief of Japanese Forces in Central China; Nishio Appointed to Supreme Military Council

Tokyo: Former Commander-in-Chief of Japanese Forces in Central China, Hata Shunroku, has been ordered to resume his old post, replacing Nishio Toshiharu. Nishio, who recently completed a ten-day inspection tour of North China, has been appointed as a member of the Supreme Military Council. It is noted that Hata Shunroku was the one who, representing the army, demanded a national reorganization, leading to the downfall of the Yonai cabinet. The Army Department took advantage of the routine semi-annual transfer and promotion of army officers to announce Hata Shunroku's appointment this morning. The first batch of transfers involved a total of 78 senior officers. Hata Shunroku is now the commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces in China, with a part of his headquarters located in Nanking. It is reported that the Japanese government's policy regarding the China situation will not change as a result. Furthermore, according to Japanese sources, the change in commander-in-chief is intended to consolidate Japan's fixed policies, given the outbreak of the European war, the formation of the Tripartite Pact, and Japan's recognition of the changed circumstances in the world, especially in East Asia. The personnel changes were particularly focused on adding competent personnel to the technical departments in order to reorganize the military and achieve practical results. Among the transfers, Lieutenant General Ogoh, who was active in North China and Manchuria after the Changkufeng Incident, was transferred to the Supreme Military Council, and Imperial Aide-de-Camp, Lieutenant General Shimizu, was transferred to an undisclosed post. Major General Takahashi was transferred to Chief of Staff of the Korean Army, Lieutenant General Sakai was transferred to Chief of the Design Department of the Army Ministry's Weapons Bureau, and Major General Yamamoto was transferred to the Weapons Bureau.

Editorial: The Approaching Storm in the International Situation

The South Pacific and the Balkan Peninsula have recently become the two focal points of international attention. The former is due to Japan's mediation of the Thai-French Indochina dispute, which is aggressively using military force to compel France to accept territorial concessions. The latter is due to British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to Turkey after the rapprochement between Turkey and Bulgaria, while Bulgaria is reportedly about to join the Axis powers in the coming days. The diplomatic struggle between Britain and Germany in the Balkans appears to have already evolved into a face-to-face confrontation.

Regarding the Far East, the "Thai-French Indochina dispute" orchestrated by Japan has already revealed its ugliness. The recent forced acceptance by Vietnam of the so-called final proposal is an unprecedented bad example in international mediation. Imagine a mediator in a third-party position actually threatening with naval demonstrations and the withdrawal of nationals while repeatedly claiming to maintain peace. This kind of mediation from the leader of the "New Order in East Asia" should not be surprising. However, how should these two led parties, engaged in the struggle like the clam and the heron, deeply reflect on reaching this point? According to Associated Press, the Vichy government has reportedly been forced to accept the Japanese proposal, which is also expected, because it is very unlikely to expect the Vichy authorities to turn around and join hands with Britain and the United States to jointly resist the Axis. Moreover, Hitler is currently eager for Japan to resolutely advance southward. If Japan asks him to first obtain a "springboard" for southward expansion - Vietnam, Hitler seems unlikely to be overly stingy. But the problem is not limited to this. What needs to be known in the future is whether Japan, after completing the mediation, will only obtain some "rewards" locally, or will it take the opportunity to stir up trouble in other areas. In other words, will Japan no longer launch offensives further into Burma, Malaya, or the Dutch East Indies? Assuming it advances southward, what will be its relationship with the Soviet Union? Otherwise, France will have given the gift in vain, and what will be the relationship between Germany and Japan?

Regarding Southeast Europe, Bulgaria had previously refused to join the Axis powers under the support of the Soviet Union. However, according to various reports today, Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov have reportedly gone to Vienna to formally sign the Tripartite Pact. Assuming this is true, it proves that Bulgaria, unable to withstand Nazi pressure, has finally succumbed. The most likely consequence of this is, of course, that German troops will pass through Bulgarian territory to attack Greece. Therefore, the question is how will Turkey, which has just signed a non-aggression pact with Bulgaria and reaffirmed its treaty obligations to Britain, deal with this situation? According to Agence France-Presse, after the establishment of the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression pact, although the Soviet authorities denied prior knowledge of it, the joint declaration issued by both sides was actually drafted in collaboration with the Soviet ambassador to Turkey. Originally, according to normal reasoning, it is difficult to believe that the Soviet government, which has always regarded the Black Sea region as its "living space," would not have been involved in such a major public matter concerning the safety of the Balkans and involving a "friendly country" like Turkey. So, has the Soviet Union also acquiesced to Bulgaria's eventual accession to the Axis? Assuming that the Moscow authorities no longer object to the passage of German troops through Bulgaria, it can be imagined that Turkey must have received assurances from the Soviet Union before establishing a non-aggression pact with Bulgaria. Although this conjecture is highly possible, it does not seem to be consistent with the facts that British Foreign Secretary Eden and Army Chief of Staff Dill went to Turkey to conduct political and military talks, and that the Turkish government subsequently issued a communique stating that both sides completely agreed on all viewpoints. If Turkey's attitude has completely changed, there is no need to conduct talks with the British authorities again. Is it not an action deliberately offending Germany or even defying the Soviet Union's intentions if foreign news reports say that both sides have determined the scope of the "zone where Turkey does not allow foreign activity" (including Salonika)? All of this is quite chaotic, but it is enough to show that the Soviet Union's intentions are still the decisive factor in the current Balkan situation. One theory is that when the British and Turkish authorities conducted talks this time, both sides were cautious and tried their best to avoid causing suspicion from the Soviet Union. Eden even telegraphed British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps to go to Ankara and personally instruct him to explain Britain's position to the Soviet government. This is not only very realistic, but also further proves the importance of the Soviet Union's position.

In summary, it can be seen that the Soviet Union is in a pivotal position in both the tense situations in the Far East and Southeast Europe. Assuming that the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty is finally concluded, Japan will undoubtedly advance southward after successfully mediating the Thai-French Indochina dispute. Assuming that the Soviet government acquiesces to Hitler's passage through Bulgaria and agrees to suppress Turkey's non-interference, then a German attack on Greece will also become a reality soon. Therefore, the future movements of the Moscow authorities, as discussed in this newspaper the day before yesterday, have become the most flexible factor in the international situation. However, there are other principles: If Stalin truly makes concessions to Germany in the Balkans, he can tighten his pressure on Japan in the Far East. This is one. Assuming that the Soviet Union truly signs a political agreement with Japan, allowing Japan to defend the north and advance south, that would at most encourage Japan to clash with Britain and the United States, thereby jumping into another quagmire, and would not change its policy of aiding China because of Japan's southward advance. This is two. Assuming that German troops actually pass through Bulgaria to attack Greece, Hitler must offer Stalin a "great guarantee" that he will not infringe on the Soviet Union's gateway to the Black Sea - the Dardanelles Strait. Therefore, in order to avoid Turkey's concerns, it may adopt a "circuitous passage" strategy. In other words, German troops may first enter Bulgaria, and then enter Yugoslavia from southern Bulgaria, so as to directly assist the Italian army on the Albanian front, and attack northwestern Greece on the other hand. This is three.

France Continues Efforts for Peace in Thai-French Indochina Dispute

Vichy Government Holds Meeting to Decide on Response to Japanese Proposals

Vichy: It was announced here that the French Cabinet believed last night that Japan's mediation proposal for the French Indochina-Thailand dispute was acceptable. The conditions were not announced. It was announced that after a two-and-a-half-hour meeting, the Cabinet had decided on the "government position regarding the French-Thai negotiations in Tokyo." French Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Land Minister, and Navy Minister Admiral Darlan issued a general policy of the government. It is reported that for the sake of peace, Vichy has decided to respond to the first peace proposal of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke. It is heard that Matsuoka has reduced the territorial concessions in the original demands, but Thailand can still obtain part of Laos west of the Mekong River and an important part of northwestern Cambodia. The French response will be sent to Tokyo tonight (this announcement was issued at 11:00 PM Vichy time on Friday, which is 7:00 AM Shanghai time on Saturday, and 8:00 AM Tokyo time on Saturday). Authoritative sources said that this response will allow the French representatives in Tokyo to continue their efforts for peace, hoping to reach a final settlement before the expiration of the armistice. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)

London: The Vichy French Cabinet held a meeting last night, three hours after the reported deadline set by Japan, and decided on a French response to the Japanese mediation proposal for the Thai-French Indochina dispute. An official communique was issued after the meeting, stating that the Cabinet had decided on the attitude the government should adopt towards the negotiations in Tokyo. A feature of this Cabinet meeting was the full attendance of all ministers. According to a dispatch from Bangkok, there are indications that if the French do not give a satisfactory reply to the Japanese proposal, Thailand and Japan will jointly find a way to deal with France. The Thai representatives attending the Tokyo conference have accepted the Japanese compromise proposal, but the details have not yet been worked out. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

Saigon: The news of Vichy's acceptance of Japanese demands has caused shock and sorrow among French citizens. Today, Japanese people here are drinking freely in bars along the streets and watching air defense exercises to celebrate their diplomatic victory. Officials here have not announced that France has accepted Japan's demands, but southern Vietnam has been ordered to implement light controls and conduct air defense exercises. Japanese planes flew over Hanoi all day yesterday. This action, of course, cannot ease the tension there. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)

The US and China are watching the Developments in the Situation in Vietnam.

Chungking: Chinese officials are closely watching developments in Vietnam, believing it is related to the second step in Japan's southward advance. While there is no definitive news on whether France has accepted or rejected Japan's latest mediation proposal, the general Chinese view is that this will not change Japan's final southward advance. If France accepts, it means that both Vietnam and Thailand have succumbed to Japanese pressure. If France rejects, it means that Japan will assist Thailand in forcing Vietnam to accept their terms. Chinese officials believe that although Britain and the United States are paying close attention to Japan's mediation activities in the Thai-French Indochina dispute, they do not believe that developments in Vietnam will immediately lead to a direct clash with Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

Washington: Although officials here recognize that Japan's presentation of an ultimatum to Vietnam and the appearance of Japanese fleets in the Gulf of Siam are not direct threats to the Dutch East Indies or Singapore, many believe that Japan's actions may indicate whether the Japanese navy will engage in unrestrained behavior at sea, as its army did on the Asian continent several years ago. Currently, Washington is paying close attention to every move in this mysterious mediation. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

China-Burma Transportation to be Improved Soon

Chungking: The Burmese government delegation came here last month to negotiate various issues. The results of these negotiations have been announced by the Burmese government in a public statement issued on the 17th of this month. The contents are as follows: (1) Highway Issues: The Chinese side believes that improvements are necessary. The Burmese side stated that it has taken appropriate steps to improve various shortcomings. (2) Transportation Control Issues: The Chinese government prohibited Sino-Burmese trade within its borders last December to prevent merchants from profiteering. The Burmese side implemented a fixed freight rate and vehicle allocation system to avoid losses for Burmese merchants. This system has now been accepted by the Chinese government, which is also considering implementing a more comprehensive plan to control transportation throughout the route. (3) Transit Tax Issues: The Chinese side stated that the Burmese government's tax rates are too high. The Burmese side replied that the current collection of a 1% tax is not unreasonable due to increased customs and the placement of guards to protect trade on the route. (4) Railway Construction Issues: The Chinese government believes that connecting the railways of the two countries is absolutely necessary. Representatives from both sides conducted detailed discussions on the economic feasibility of the route. The Chinese Minister of Communications also sent a memorandum to the Burmese delegation. In addition, representatives from both sides discussed the convenience of telegraphic communications and air cargo transport. The Burmese government will consider this. The Chinese side also agreed to give favorable consideration to the Burmese request for Chinese assistance in transporting raw silk to Burma. Border issues were also discussed, and a direction was identified that both governments are expected to accept. (Havas World Telegraphic Agency dispatch, 29th)

Talks in Turkey Successfully Concluded

Reiterating Unwavering Commitment to Alliance

Paying Particular Attention to Jointly Protecting Mutual Interests

British Foreign Secretary Eden Departs Ankara for Athens

London: A public statement issued in Ankara, Turkey, stated that British and Turkish officials have fully agreed on various issues arising from the international situation during talks between British Foreign Secretary Eden and the Turkish President and government officials. Last night, Ankara Radio indicated that the mutual interests of Britain and Turkey in dealing with the current situation in the Balkans were a matter of particular attention. According to its broadcast, the two governments reaffirmed their complete commitment to the Turkish-British alliance and reviewed the current international situation in all aspects. The situation in the Balkans and the mutual interests of Turkey and Britain were also given special attention. The two governments have repeatedly reached full agreement on policies regarding the aforementioned issues. On Thursday night, Eden met with the Turkish President for two hours. Yesterday afternoon, Eden met with Turkish journalists and asked them to convey his thanks and those of General Dill to the Turkish people for the warm welcome they received in Turkey. Eden said that this welcome was truly a sincere expression of the Turkish people's sympathy for the British people. He had visited Turkey in 1929, and more than ten years later, Turkey has made great progress. He was deeply impressed by the construction of this new Turkey. The efforts displayed everywhere are a guarantee of Turkey's future. He will never forget the pleasant contacts he had with Turkish officials and the public here. Last night, Eden and Dill departed from Ankara. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

Ankara: According to a special communique issued here last night, the British-Turkish conference paid particular attention to the current difficult situation in the Balkans.

It is said that this conference is intended to counter British Foreign Secretary Eden's diplomatic activities in Turkey. (International Society dispatch, 1st)

British Diplomatic Activities in Turkey Strive to Avoid Causing Suspicion from the Soviet Union

Basel, Switzerland: The Basler Nachrichten reports a dispatch from Budapest stating that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps' visit to Ankara has attracted much attention in the Balkans. It is widely believed that Cripps' visit is to personally report to British Foreign Secretary Eden on the Soviet Union's wait-and-see policy. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will give his repeatedly delayed speech after Cripps returns to Moscow. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

Vichy: Diplomatic observers here recently commented on British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to Turkey, stating that when the British and Turkish authorities conducted talks in Ankara this time, both sides were cautious and tried their best to avoid causing suspicion from the Soviet Union. This is noteworthy. For example, in addition to summoning British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps to Turkey for talks, Eden also met with Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Vinogradov once. The reason for this is that a major principle underlying Turkey's current policy is to maintain a relationship of good faith with the Soviet Union. The Turkish government has repeatedly stated that any action that conflicts with Soviet interests is not something Turkey is willing to do. This is clear evidence. As for the outcome of the British-Turkish talks, regardless of any decisions made, it can be asserted that Turkey will certainly demand guarantees to fully control the Dardanelles Strait. Foreign Secretary Eden has probably instructed Ambassador Cripps to explain this intention to the Soviet government in detail, because the Moscow authorities have always regarded maintaining the status quo of the Dardanelles Strait as a matter of vital importance to the Soviet Union's survival. After Turkey and Bulgaria issued a non-aggression declaration, although the Soviet side issued a statement denying prior knowledge of it, the function of this declaration is to maintain the neutrality of the countries along the Black Sea coast, which coincides with Soviet interests and is welcomed by the Moscow authorities. Moreover, according to diplomatic sources, the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Vinogradov, made the greatest contribution in drafting this declaration. It is said that Stalin personally selected him for his mission to Turkey. When the conflict between Italy and Greece broke out, Turkey should have sent troops to aid Greece in accordance with the existing treaty relations between Turkey and Greece, but it is said that this was also due to Vinogradov's persuasion. The Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression declaration emerged under these circumstances. Not only that, but in addition to Vinogradov's many activities in Ankara, Soviet Minister to Bulgaria Sobolev also notified the Bulgarian government of the main points of this activity. After the Italian-Greek conflict, Bulgaria did not take the opportunity to make territorial demands on Greece, which was probably also due to Soviet pressure. In short, the main goal of the Soviet Union is to consolidate peace in the Balkan Peninsula. Although British diplomacy is frequently active in Turkey, it is clearly aimed at revitalizing the British-Turkish alliance in order to take action against a certain party, but unless the Soviet Union is given full guarantees first, this diplomatic activity may not be easily completed. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

British Newspaper Discusses the Situation in the Balkans

Germany's War of Nerves Has Clearly Failed

London: The "Times" diplomatic correspondent stated that the tense situation in the Balkans in recent days and the war of nerves reaching its peak can be discussed, and the true situation in the Balkans can be obtained in the capitals of Turkey and Greece, which show the strategic significance. The spirit of resistance in these two countries is now very clear and strong. Like the war of nerves and the war of artillery fire, there are shifts in fate. Last week, Germany seemed to have no disadvantage in the Balkans except for Greece, such as increasing troops in the country, preparing to enter Bulgaria, claiming to have obtained tacit approval from the South, and boasting that the Turkish-Bulgarian agreement was a victory for the Germans. This week, for various reasons, the nerves of the Balkans have calmed down slightly and are gradually suspecting that Germany intends to use intimidation to achieve its desires. The Germans know that if they resort to war, the anti-German front will quickly be extended. The fact that the British Foreign Minister arrived in Ankara and Germany suddenly announced that it did not want to immediately enter Bulgaria probably has a clear relationship. Turkey has recently announced to the world that it cannot ignore the threat to the Bulgarian mountains and the Aegean coast, which are Turkey's security zones. Upon hearing this, Germany probably wanted to make Turkey aware that the crisis would not break out immediately and that it was not necessary to establish closer relations with Britain, so it spread the slogan of not wanting to occupy Bulgaria in various places in the Balkans.

Bulgaria Joins the Axis

Protocol Signed in Vienna Yesterday

Bulgaria Declares It Will Maintain Neighborly Friendship

Vienna: Bulgaria has joined the German-Italian-Japanese Pact.

Germany, Italy, and Japan were represented by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Foreign Minister Ciano, and Ambassador to Germany Oshima, respectively. German leader Hitler also attended the ceremony. When Prime Minister Filov was entertained, Hitler was also present. Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov arrived in Vienna by plane from Sofia at 12:30 PM today. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop welcomed him at the airport. The Mayor of Vienna and other party and government dignitaries also went to the airport to welcome him. After Filov reviewed the honor guard, he was accompanied by Ribbentrop to the Bristol Hotel. The public cheered and paid their respects as they drove through the streets. (Haitong dispatch, 1st)

London: German official radio announced that Bulgaria signed a protocol in Vienna today to join the Tripartite Pact. First, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop led his "guests" into the Yellow Room of the Pilfordry Palace, sitting in the center of a long table, with Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov on the right and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano on the left. The German Foreign Minister delivered a short speech welcoming Filov, expressing satisfaction with Bulgaria's decision to join the Pact, and said that it was regrettable that Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov could not attend due to illness. The content of the protocol is the same as that signed by Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia. Filov signed first, followed by Ribbentrop, Ciano, and Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima. The signing ceremony was completed. Filov then read a statement in German, stating that Bulgaria will continue to faithfully fulfill its friendship agreements with its neighbors and will continue its friendly relations with the Soviet Union. After the speech, Ribbentrop celebrated Bulgaria's decision and expressed confidence that more countries would soon join the Tripartite Pact. According to the German official news agency Sofia, the Bulgarian Parliament has scheduled an emergency meeting for Sunday afternoon at 4:00 PM, at which time Prime Minister Filov may deliver a declaration. London sources do not consider Bulgaria's participation in the Tripartite Pact to be of practical importance and believe that the Bulgarian people will suffer the consequences of their government's actions.

(Associated Press dispatch, 1st)

Sofia: British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendell, presented a strong protest to Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov last night against the Bulgarian side's arrest of several journalists. A reporter from the London Times and two reporters from other British and American newspapers were on the list. As a result of the protest, all those arrested were released. The British Minister's servant, who was mobilized into the army without notice yesterday morning, was released last night and allowed to return to his post after the Minister took strong action. The British Minister also discussed the scope of Bulgaria's mobilization with the Bulgarian Prime Minister. In the British Minister's opinion, there is no reason for Bulgaria to mobilize under the current circumstances. All telephone lines to foreign countries in Bulgaria have been cut off. The Bulgarian newspapers have not yet published the British Minister's statements yesterday that Bulgaria is in danger of becoming a battlefield, but these statements have attracted great attention here. As for the rumors that the British Minister's statements included that Britain's severance of relations with Bulgaria is imminent, they are completely unfounded. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

A "Farce" Performed Under the Tyranny of German Troops

London: A spokesman for the Free Romanian National Committee in Britain claimed that the referendum to be held in Romania tomorrow in accordance with Nazi methods is actually a "farce."

The spokesman also recalled the remarks made by the British Ambassador after leaving Bucharest, namely that Romanians are pro-British and opposed to German cooperation. It is noted that the chairman of the Free Romanian National Committee is Tilea, the former Romanian Minister to Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

Germany Expedites Construction of Small Submarines

London: Reuters naval correspondent says that in order to fulfill his promise to blockade Britain in the spring, Hitler has built submarines that are much smaller than previous models, with shorter construction times, fewer materials required, and fewer crew members. However, training crew members takes a long time, so Hitler must not have trained enough crew members to meet the needs of all submarines. The difficulty with small submarines lies in their reduced range of activity, but since Germany can use French licensed ports as bases, this difficulty is not very important from the German point of view. It is widely believed that Italian submarines are currently operating in the Atlantic alongside German submarines. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

Japan's Gold Outflow Reaches 700 Million US Dollars

This Is Only One of the Costs of Invading China

Other Losses Are Even More Countless

Washington: Objective international experts and economic experts analyze that the cost of Japan's war of aggression against China is the outflow of gold, the loss of international trade, and the reduction of shipping income, all of which are extremely high costs, and more sacrifices must be made in the future. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan's gold outflow to the United States has reached 700 million US dollars, but this is only one of the various costs. Japan's connection with the Axis powers will not only not reduce its economic burden, but will increase it, because Germany and Italy cannot conduct large-scale trade with the Far East. Financial aid to Japan is impossible, and aid to Japan with goods or services is also impossible. For the sake of military secrecy, Japan has largely stopped publishing foreign trade statistics. Gold reserves are reported to be 501,000,000 Japanese yen, but this is only a nominal figure, because part of it has been earmarked for special domestic purposes. Since current Japanese economic statistics and indicators are not available, the number of years that its expenses for fighting on the Asian continent can be maintained can only be guessed from the side. Most of Japan's exports are to the yen bloc, and imports mostly come from the non-yen bloc. As Japanese ships mostly have to supply war transport, their overseas shipping income is lost, which is another loss. An inevitable result of this is that Japan must replace all imported goods with its own domestic products, and the people's living standards must be greatly reduced. How long this situation can be sustained depends on Japan's ability to mobilize and requisition national human and financial resources, the extent to which it organizes and builds new manufacturing industries, and the scope of its expansion of foreign trade. US official statistics already have several numbers that can be verified. Japan's foreign trade reached an unprecedented peak in 1935, as did industrial production. At that time, the prices of raw materials in foreign markets plummeted, and Japan bought them cheaply. Coupled with low worker wages and low shipping costs, Japan's power in international commerce was greatly exerted. Two years later, in July 1937, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and Japan's invasion of China began. This is considered by modern scholars to be the beginning of a new period in world history. Since then, Japan has purchased countless industrial materials and parts, indirectly for military use. The entire peacetime economy has been transformed into a war economy. The trade balance with the United States is in deficit year after year, resulting in a steady flow of gold into the United States. Gold shipments to the United States were 246,000,000 US dollars in 1937, 168,000,000 US dollars in 1938, 169,000,000 US dollars in 1939, and 98,400,000 US dollars in the first eleven months of 1940. There is currently no end in sight. As far as the United States is concerned, the important expenses for Japan's war against China can be divided into two major financial sources: one is silk sold by Japan to the United States, and the other is gold transported to the United States.

Education News:

Local schools' faculty and students participating in the signature campaign to comfort England. The Education Department has issued a general notice for consistent participation.

(Dahua News Agency) The local Education Department, considering the signature campaign to comfort England initiated by the Sino-American-Japanese Daily News sufficient to promote national diplomacy and enhance Sino-British relations, has issued a general notice to all schools encouraging faculty and students to participate. Elementary schools and short-term elementary schools should also use this signature campaign as the central theme to implement large-scale unit design. All educators in the city should mobilize together, go into the community, and encourage people from all walks of life to participate enthusiastically. In addition to publication in newspapers, no separate document will be issued regarding this matter.

The Education Association Responds

According to Daguang News Agency, since initiating the signature campaign to comfort England and drafting a telegram to British Prime Minister Churchill for the signature comfort and submitting it to the Sino-American-Japanese Daily News for publication, people from all walks of life have responded enthusiastically. The local Education Association has issued a general notice to all organizations and schools at all levels, urging them to take the lead as role models for the public. Furthermore, the association considers signing to comfort friendly nations as an educational endeavor in itself. Therefore, it is stipulated that schools at all levels should propose research during history and geography classes to explore the significance of initiating this campaign and the methods for carrying it out. As for the method of signing names, all parties should use black ink brushes to write on domestic paper. Gathering and mounting these signatures into handscrolls later will be more convenient. Fearing that the preparation of numerous papers would be cumbersome and that varying sizes would make compilation difficult, the association has printed thousands of these signature papers and distributed them to various schools for faculty and students to use. Schools that have not received these signature papers can submit the required quantity to the Education Association mailbox, No. 102, at the Zhengyan Newspaper Office. The association will send the signature papers immediately for use. The association, having led schools at all levels in a warm response to the signature campaign to comfort England, anticipates that this campaign will be widely launched in local schools.

Because the college's performance in concurrently managing social education in the 28th academic year was excellent, the Ministry of Education allocated 2,000 yuan as encouragement.

The final of this year's International Cup, organized by the Western Union Football Club, was held at the Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. The defending champion, Portugal, played against the French team. As a result, Portugal won 5-1 and retained the championship. The French Consul General, Mr. Magri, was specially invited to preside over the opening kick-off ceremony. After the match, Mr. Shen Siliang, President of St. John's University, personally presented the awards. Both sides performed extremely well yesterday. Under the leadership of forward Bao Xituo, the French team's offensive was very strong, posing a threat to the Portuguese team from time to time. However, they lacked scoring talent. The two defenders, Weiketai and Kaositan, were both famous generals, so the French team could not score. The Portuguese team was strong overall. Gaien scored five goals alone yesterday, which was commendable and worthy of praise. In the first half of yesterday's match, Portugal took a 3-1 lead. In the second half, they scored another two goals. Portugal then maintained the silver cup with a 5-1 victory.

Grain:

The rice market is actually lacking in spot foreign rice. There are piles of rice in warehouses, but very little on the market. This strange phenomenon is because everyone is eagerly awaiting the sound of gunfire.

Since the rice market has been controlled by major rice hoarding households who refuse to release their stocks, the situation has become even more tense as of yesterday. Spot rice is uniquely expensive, and there is a complete absence of goods. Even medium-grade rice is rarely sampled. Market transactions are limited to some holdings by traders to meet store sales, with grade one Siamese rice opening at 85 yuan and medium-grade tea rice at 73 yuan plus commission. Some futures transactions were slightly opened. Guangshan gangs and others released 6,000 bags of Mintang rice for delivery in four days at a price of 86 yuan. Fu Si's Taiyuan Wheel No. 4 released nearly 1,000 bags of sub-grade broken rice at a price of 67 yuan. New transactions included 500 tons of broken rice for March-April delivery released by Shen Ji at a price of 80.07 yuan. Short rice for February-March delivery was priced at 92 yuan, and broken rice for March-April delivery was priced at 79.5 to 79 yuan. The market is secretly brewing price increases. There have been many instances of price subsidies of 300 to 400 bags per day outside the market. The price of foreign silver dollars has been sought after by hoarders, and the market has also risen sharply by 1 to 2 yuan. The rice from this factory has also been sold at 85 yuan. In short, the rice market is not easing, and hoarders are deliberately acting maliciously, disregarding the food of millions of people and repeatedly violating the prohibition orders. What can be done? Their audacity is growing. Moreover, the investigation of hoarders is not practical. Hoarders with financial resources are unwilling to show compassion. Everyone is just eagerly awaiting the sound of gunfire.

National rice such as thick and thin japonica, which had softened a bit in the past few days, tightened again yesterday due to reduced sources and the disappearance of spot foreign rice. With the support of cargo owners, the prices of both thick and thin japonica rose by 1 to 2 yuan. Kunshan Hu Bai japonica opened at 108 yuan, second grade at 105.7 yuan, special grade at 109 yuan, Changbang special original packaging at 112-113 yuan, and Qingjiao Hu saw thin rice at 104 yuan, second grade at 102.5 yuan.

Glutinous rice is still scarce on the market, but the sales market has become active due to the unavailability of foreign rice. Demand temporarily exceeded supply, becoming a rare commodity, and shouting prices rose wildly. As a result, the price increased by 1 to 2 yuan. Hong Kong high-grade round-grain glutinous rice opened at 90 yuan, ordinary at 89 yuan, long-grain medium grade at 87-88 yuan, and glutinous tea rice at 81 yuan and 80.05 yuan. Looking back at the overall situation, the rice market was tight all day yesterday, and the state of foreign rice hoarding is increasing day by day. If we allow it to drag on, the future of people's food will be even more alarming.

Flour and wheat are also tightening at the same time, hoping for the South Seas turmoil.

The flour market suddenly became tense yesterday. It is rumored that although the flour cargo is already loaded, whether it can arrive on schedule is still a question. Therefore, people's hearts instantly turned positive. Moreover, Chinese factories must wait for foreign wheat to arrive before they can produce flour, so they are taking this opportunity to hoard. Golden Dragon brand Kan flour, after falling to 15 yuan, jumped to 25.2 yuan yesterday. Australian flower, bird, and clock tower brand flour was priced at 26.2 yuan, and the after-market price was shouted to 26.5 yuan. Other Gu brands were also tightened by 1 to 3 yuan. The total market transaction was more than 10,000 bags, and the market situation was quite firm.

Wheat is also quite firm, because the arrival of wheat from the mainland has been scarce for a long time, and there are many problems with foreign wheat sources due to international turmoil. Therefore, people's hearts are optimistic. The few wheat stocks in warehouses on the market are especially rare commodities, with shouting prices of 42-43 yuan. The Japanese factory's retail price has been released to 38 yuan, but there is no spot available.

Soybean oil and corn are jumping wildly, hoping that Japan will attack the South.

Yesterday's market conditions for soybean oil and corn were still normal in the early morning due to ordinary spot sales, and the overall situation had little special development. But by the afternoon, the situation changed drastically. Regardless of insiders or outsiders, hoarders uniformly absorbed all kinds of prices, and prices rose in a straight line. The hoarders hope that Japan will advance south and an outbreak will occur, and that the source will be interrupted. Making a fortune is just a matter of moments, so each cargo is brought in regardless of price, and each one is a windfall. As a result, the market was in chaos. The result was that oil rose by 3 yuan, beans jumped by 4 yuan, corn futures rose by 5 yuan, and the British and Chinese companies' spot prices both rose by 3 to 4 yuan. Soybean cake also rose by 0.3 yuan. Today, 2,000 bags of corn are being shipped to Yantai.

Finance:

Foreign exchange is mediocre.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions saw no changes in HSBC's list price. The trend of the British and American exchange black market was mediocre, and speculators still came to sell. Because foreign banks' appetite is still high, the market supply and demand are balanced, and the change is small. In general, the current US exchange rate is 5.625 yuan, and the transaction is quite high. Few people are interested in shillings, and there is no news to stimulate people. Operators' transactions turned clear, and the closing price was 5.625 yuan for spot US exchange and 3.412875 for shillings. Compared with the previous day, there was no honor or disgrace.

Exchange rates have not fluctuated.

In the early morning, London's large-denomination near-term bonds fell by 0.0625, and the long-term bonds were stable. New York's silver price remained stable, and London's gold price remained stable. The exchange rate between British and American currencies in Shanghai remained unchanged. The exchange rate between American and British currencies in Shanghai evened out. The central government's listed exchange rates remained as before.

Foreign firms such as Maijiali and Youli were willing to accept, and the price did not change, with both spot and futures being 5.625 yuan. By noon, with the decrease in sellers, the market slightly softened. The closing result was 5.625 yuan for spot US exchange and 5.59375 yuan for March. The spot US exchange and the March futures were both at 3.412875. Compared with the closing price of the previous day, there were no fluctuations.

Tianjin Exchange Rate Lengthens

Tianjin, 1st (Saturday) Electric, the exchange market opened loose this morning. The London telegraphic transfer is stable, still standing at 3.75 pence. The New York telegraphic transfer is hard at 0.09375, at 6.21875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 0.25 yuan to 91 yuan. The "Joint Notes" black market is expensive at 1.5 yuan to 75 yuan.

The gold market cannot muster enthusiasm, and the market price is slightly lower.

Yesterday's spot gold black market situation was still depressed. The pace of all parties was uneven, causing the market price to hover. The lowest was 6,140 yuan, maintained by Xinyuan and Hesheng, reaching 6,190 yuan. However, Xiangxing and Yongxianghe came to cash out, and the trend went downward. At noon, the foreign exchange rate slightly softened and reported 6,163 yuan. The closing was down 6 yuan from the previous day. The spot market was first heard to be 600 yuan higher than the futures market, and there was once an opening, and then retreated to 580 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and half-day turnover was 8,000 taels. The price of jewelry gold did not move, and the tariff gold was stable.

Half-day fluctuation of 50 yuan.

In the early morning, the market opened sharply lower to 6,140 yuan due to bleak sentiment, which was more than 20 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. After the opening, the buying trend slightly rose, and a large Hesheng first purchased, rising to 6,185 yuan. Afterwards, a Yilai sold and lowered by 20 yuan, reporting 6,165 yuan. However, Hesheng and Xinyuan had a very good appetite at this time, so they were seen to rise to 6,190 yuan. However, Xianghe, Xiangxing, and Yong came to cash out futures, and Yilai continued to be unable to support, pressing down to 6,155 yuan. The falling wind began to dissipate because the foreign exchange rate suddenly turned slightly tight. A large Mingfeng accepted and returned to 6,170 yuan. In the afternoon, the result was that retail investors slightly sold, reporting 6,163 yuan. The closing was down 6 yuan from the previous day, and the half-day fluctuation was 50 yuan. The selling price of the bank's own brand of gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the spot, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current bid gold was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few deals.

Jewelry gold original plate did not move.

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops has not changed. Datonghang still lists 690 yuan, and Xintonghang is similar to the previous price. The purchase price is 30 yuan lower.

Foreign currency changed very little.

Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions saw a slight softening of spot prices, and cash prices were also sluggish. British and American gold pounds each fell by 1 yuan, and British gold notes remained stable as before, and the market price stood still. The US dollar Cai changed to a very small extent, and eventually reported a drop of 0.04 yuan. The supply and demand of Hong Kong tickets were uniform, and the market price stood still. The need for Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets was still strong, and the market price rose uniformly, the former rising to 1.79 yuan and the latter continuing to rise to 1.47 yuan.

Securities:

The bond market is hovering.

The public bond black market fluctuated yesterday. Although the rice was detached, the trend seemed to have turned firm. The opening still went up, and type C was raised to 6 yuan. The buying atmosphere was heavy and it returned to 6 yuan. Like this, the hovering continued, and the long and short sides could not stop. The daily change must be very drastic, and it is still brewing. Xinfu still had an appetite in yesterday's half-day transaction, first opening type C at 6.57 yuan. Then Delong, Tongshun, Lianyi, Yizhong, Jiufeng and other companies successively bought, and type C rose to 6.1 yuan. However, Hengfu, Yitai, Dachang, Tongkang, and No. 16 sold more, and it returned to 6 yuan. The situation in the field now is that the short side is too crowded, and if they want to go small, they cannot. There is compensation when the price goes small, and although the long side's appetite is strong, they are unwilling to raise the price. Therefore, there is a hovering situation, but on the whole, I always feel that it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. The market price showed both gains and losses, and type D and 96 were still not opened. The transaction was about 1 million yuan. Here is a brief table:

Stock trading: The transaction was 100 shares of Xinxin Company stock, and the price was 20.05 yuan.

London, 28th (Friday) Electric, the listed market for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat and sluggish today, and the market situation showed no gains or losses.

Xinhuo Spinning Factory Dividend - Converted to Taiwan Weekly Interest of 0.02 yuan.

Yarn Flower Phase Rotation Cotton Market Lonely

The yarn market has seen another rotational phase, but people's minds are different on whether to go high or low. Some people think that due to the reduction in electricity and the factory's production, the yarn price is optimistic. The short-selling aspect is that the actual need is clear and the outlet is very narrow, and the thinking is mediocre. Currently, it is in a state of hovering, but a certain major household's intention is still to hope for a rise. A certain number in the industry also threw out Shuangma in March due to the tense Pacific situation. If it is not right, they will make up the current factory order. The high price of 20-count Shuangma is 1,376 yuan, and the low price is 1,359 yuan. In the afternoon, it was the weekend, and the black market was silent.

Shuangma Morning Opening The enthusiastic atmosphere of the afternoon was suddenly broken up. Due to the tense situation in the Far East, there were more fees and fewer buyers. The first set price was 1,375 yuan, and the fees were more enthusiastic. The market price has continued to fall to 1,359 yuan. The old Guangdong who bought in March in the past is now coming out again, and people's hearts are softer. Then it was heard that the gold price was still high, the short selling was replenished, and the father rose to 1,370 yuan. The closing price was 1,368 yuan. Check the statistics of transactions in half a day, 1,645 packages. The amount of each gang to buy is listed as left,

Hong Kong 410, Xiamen 10, Ningbo 20, Industry 6,200, Statistics 6,645

The current cotton situation is even more lonely due to the weekend, and the form is still depressed and listless. In addition, the yarn market has fallen, and the cotton market is becoming more and more mediocre.

The New York cotton market was calm and unremarkable, and then continued to rise due to textile industry purchases and good spot transactions. The result was a closing price of 0.45 pounds higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market is scarce and the market situation is flat. First, it rose due to speculative buying, and then fell due to the closing of long positions. As a result, yesterday was even with a forecast of 1 rupee higher.

The Shanghai Foreign Cotton Exchange, except for the occasional one or two batches of retail transactions between the Hua numbers, all parties are still waiting and seeing, and are temporarily unwilling to take any action.

Grey Cloth/Cotton Cloth: More grey cloth is emerging.

Factory Cloth The market tended to be slightly tired yesterday, which was due to the sluggish actual sales and the hoarding of households watching and waiting. The sale price was difficult to boost. The opening price of Da Peng Fugui fine cloth in the morning was 43 yuan, and then the price fell by 0.25 yuan per piece. The supply of coarse and fine twill was very stable due to the lack of stock in the factory. The price of coarse cloth continued to fall by 0.25 yuan per piece. The price of bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 0.5 yuan per piece. The transaction of various cloths on this street was more than 300 pieces. The Zhejiang Shao Wen Yong gang handled about 70 or 80 pieces of colored cloth, coarse and fine cloth, etc. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled hundreds of pieces of colored cloth, colored oblique bleached cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and twill. Today, there are 70 pieces of grey cloth transported to Tianjin and 150 pieces transported to Yantai.

Dongbu First tired and then firm, the market atmosphere is stable, white goods, fine cloth, and fine oblique, are still tight due to the continuous need for dyeing and sales, 12-pound Feiyu fine cloth sold for 48 yuan, and Longtou fine cloth opened for 46.89 yuan in the morning, and rose to 47.25 yuan at noon closing. Jiao Junzi Serge is still sold for 1.275 yuan, and all suits are rising.

Yesterday, the price of Beautiful brand was 605 yuan per box, and the price of Phoenix brand was 590 yuan per box. Other miscellaneous brands were also reduced in price, a drop of 20 yuan to 40 yuan compared to the previous week. The retail price on the market has reached 0.1 yuan per small box.

White Lead Skin Shortage

For a while, the sense of shortage of large amounts of circulating goods. The market has skyrocketed, and currently No. 1 color per barrel requires 1,450 yuan.

Changes in Gold Prices Zhu Lisun

The value of gold was extremely stable during the ancient period, and the price was also cheap. Wang Mang Zhuan: "In the past, the empress was hired with 20,000 jin of gold, which was 200 million in money." Therefore, in the Han Dynasty, one jin of gold was worth 10,000 coins. From the beginning of the Han Dynasty to Wang Mang, the rate did not change at all. There are very few records of gold prices in the Tang Dynasty. Only Zhao Lin's Yin Hua Lu Volume 3: "Fan Yang Lu Zhongyuan sold gold in Yangzhou, and at that time he encountered expensive gold, and both earned 8,000." This is what can be found. And Sun Tzu Suanjing Volume 2 said that one jin of gold was worth 100,000 coins. One tael was worth 6,250 coins, which is quite close to the above-mentioned value of 8,000 when gold was expensive. The price of gold in the Song Dynasty fluctuated greatly. At first, it was only 8,000, but at the end of the Song Dynasty, it had risen to 340,000 coins. Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian Volume 18, Taizong Taiping Xingguo 2nd year June, "Jiangnan West Road Transfer Envoy said that the old estimate of gold was 10,000, and now please estimate 8,000." Also, in the same book, Zhenzong Dazhong Xiangfu 8th year November, "San Si played the wine class to change to silver. The Emperor said to the ministers, "In Xianping, silver was 800 and gold was 5,000. Now, it has increased by more than double, why?" Xianping was the beginning of Zhenzong, fifteen years away from Dazhong Xiangfu 8th year, and the price had more than doubled. The extent of the rise in gold prices can be imagined. In the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, copper coins were scarce and banknotes were popular, so the price of gold was also based on banknotes. During the Yuan Dynasty's Yuan Dynasty, one tael of gold was put into the treasury for 20,000 coins and taken out for 20,500 coins. At the time of Zhida, one tael of Zhida silver banknotes was equivalent to 5,000 coins of Yuan banknotes, and one tael of silver was equivalent to one coin of gold. The Ming Huidian records: "In the 8th year of Hongwu, one string of banknotes was equivalent to one tael of silver, and four strings of banknotes were exchanged for one tael of gold." Since the Republic of China, due to the emergence of exchanges, gold prices have been unstable. Until the 24th year of the Republic of China, when the legal currency system was implemented, the official price was set at 1,366.2 yuan per bar (ten taels). After the war, speculation rose sharply, and the price of gold rose endlessly. By the beginning of May of the 29th year, it had reached 7,200 yuan, which was the highest price of gold. The following is a brief table of the verifiable gold prices of the past dynasties:

Looking at the above, the gold prices of the past dynasties were the most level in the Western Han Dynasty, but the jinliang in the Han Dynasty was only equal to one-third of the Sui and Tang Dynasties. One jin was actually equal to more than five taels, but even if the Tang tael was calculated, each tael would reach about 2,000 coins. As for the particularly high gold prices in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, it was because they were estimated by banknotes; at that time, the banknote method was getting worse day by day, and the value was falling. For example, the Zhengtong banknote was only worth a few coins, so the price of gold also rose accordingly. The high price of gold in the Qing Dynasty was due to the fact that countries around the world abolished silver and adopted the gold standard, and thus the price of gold rose. From the 3rd to the 8th year of the Republic of China, the price of gold fell due to the European War. Today, the war has produced a surprisingly high price, which is actually created by speculators.

### Britain Takes Precautionary Measures: Sends Troops to Reinforce Defense of Malaya and Burma; Stark to Inspect Caribbean Sea; Plans to Bolster Pacific Fleet Strength

Bangkok: The British military headquarters here yesterday denied Japanese rumors that Chinese troops were concentrating on the Burmese front and expressed concern over the current lack of British troops there. According to the British military, there are only three passable roads from Thailand to Burma: one from Chiang Mai to Keng Tung, one from Sa Kaeo to Bawlakhe, and one across the Kaladan River. It is said that British troops are not only deployed along the entire Burmese front but are also concentrated at these three points. Furthermore, it is reported that many Indian troops have already set off for Malaya to protect the aircraft depots and supply depots there, so that regular troops can be freed up to take action on the Malayan front at any time. It is also said that additional Indian troops may be sent to Burma to supplement the lack of British troops there. British military circles solemnly declared that this move is purely a "precautionary measure," and the British military has no intention of aggression. (United Press dispatch, 1st)

Manila: The Japanese ship Hakone Maru arrived here today from Singapore, carrying 127 Japanese expatriates, including a Japanese vice-consul. The consul refused to comment on the Japanese withdrawal from Singapore, calling it a "routine repatriation." (United Press dispatch, 1st)

Chongqing: A high-ranking Chinese official commented on the developments in the South Pacific, saying that any part of the South Pacific, whether it is Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, or even the smallest island, is part of China's vital lifeline. Japan's southward advance and its invasion of China are inseparable facts. If Japan succeeds in its southward advance, it will mean not only Japan's complete control of the Pacific but also Japan's complete blockade of China, so that it can then turn around and deal China a fatal blow.

Moscow: The Soviet naval newspaper published an article entitled "The Philippine Islands: A Strategic Link in the U.S. Navy." According to the article, the strategic situation in the southwestern part of the Pacific naval theater has suddenly changed after British and American naval cooperation in the Pacific. Under the new situation, if the U.S. Navy uses Singapore and other British bases to coordinate operations, the position of the Philippine Islands will be extremely important. The newspaper then described the history, economy, and political situation of the Philippine Islands, and said that Japan's exports to the Philippine Islands have recently declined rapidly. According to foreign news reports, the United States has been continuously importing military supplies into the Philippine Islands, and the number of land and air force personnel has also greatly increased. The war preparations of the Philippine Islands have been expanding day by day with the deterioration of Japanese-American relations. According to recent news, the United States is constantly shipping military supplies and aircraft to the Philippines and allowing Philippine warships to be repaired in American shipyards, which all proves the strategic importance of the Philippine Islands in the Pacific.

Washington: It was announced here yesterday afternoon that Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark has just inspected the Caribbean Sea area and is said to be inspecting the recently formed Atlantic Fleet. The Navy Department refused to disclose his itinerary, but said that Admiral Stark's trip would take several weeks. Stark left amid tense Far Eastern news, sparking some speculation that the danger in the Pacific is not yet imminent. On the other hand, his trip may be to decide what military strength in the Atlantic is sufficient to augment the Pacific Fleet once an incident occurs in the Far East. The Navy Department said that Stark will inspect the naval bases obtained in exchange for destroyers from Britain. (United Press dispatch, 1st)

Manila: The U.S. Army transport ship "Garland" left here for the United States today, carrying 260 passengers, most of whom were women and children.

There were many tearful and angry people at the pier.
