### Japanese Ambassador Pays Homage to the US President to Discuss the Tense Situation in the Far East; Delivers a Private Letter from Konoe to Ease Relations Between the Two Countries; Both Sides Say They Will Continue Negotiations

Reuters, Washington, 29th – Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, delivered a private letter from Japanese Prime Minister Konoe to President Roosevelt yesterday. Subsequently, the President, the Secretary of State, and the Japanese Ambassador met at the White House. Afterwards, Secretary of State Hull disclosed that the United States may hold several meetings in an effort to communicate the differences between the two countries. A meeting similar to yesterday’s will be held within days. The reason for this meeting is to discuss the difficulties between the United States and Japan in a more intimate, face-to-face manner. When asked whether Konoe's letter could ease the situation in the Far East, Hull replied that the letter mentioned a general exchange of views on various matters between the two governments and that he thought the President would definitely reply. When reporters questioned Nomura, he declined to announce the contents of Konoe's letter. When asked if it was related to the US supply of goods to the Soviet Union, Nomura replied that he did not think so. Reporters asked Nomura whether his trip to the White House had resulted in an improvement in US-Japanese relations. Nomura did not answer. When asked if the meeting had bridged the gap between the two countries, Nomura patted the reporter on the shoulder and said with a smile, "Go ask the Secretary of State."

United Press, Washington, 29th Urgent Dispatch – It was reported here yesterday that President Roosevelt has begun private negotiations with Japanese Ambassador Nomura on US-Japanese disputes. Ambassador Nomura held a 45-minute meeting with President Roosevelt, and Secretary of State Hull was also present. It is generally believed that this decision to meet was initiated by President Roosevelt. The issues discussed were the exchange of general information between the two governments. Nomura said that he believed several more consultations would be held in the future. Hull said that the President was considering replying to Konoe's letter. Observers are therefore speculating that Prime Minister Konoe's letter mainly requested Roosevelt and Nomura to conduct private negotiations on all issues in the Far East, including Japan's desires in the South Pacific, the United States' response, and all the circumstances arising from the United States' determination to assist China and the Soviet Union. Observers stated that this kind of private meeting would be easier to approach various issues and have a more direct and intimate effect than ordinary diplomatic negotiations. Nomura constantly stated that he believed there was a possibility of a satisfactory resolution of US-Japanese relations. After Nomura left, Hull continued to stay at the President's office for another 15 minutes.

Reuters, Tokyo, 29th – Although the government is still maintaining an extremely cautious and silent attitude, newspaper commentators are still clamoring for active and direct action against Britain and the United States. Although there is a very slight hope for a satisfactory result of the Washington talks, the calls for preparing for any eventuality have not ceased.

Various Observers Speculate on the Consequences of US-Japan Negotiations

United Press, Washington, 29th – The President's talks with Japanese Ambassador Nomura yesterday suggest the possibility of Japan withdrawing from the Axis. Although the content of Konoe's note to the United States has not been disclosed, observers are all speculating that the document has opened the door for the United States and Japan to improve relations and ease tensions in the Pacific. Nomura hinted that the facts discussed in the note were far more important than the issue of shipping oil to Vladivostok, and said that he believed the note was by no means solely for discussing the oil shipment issue. Senior US officials have all emphasized that although there is still hope for a peaceful resolution of US-Japanese relations, the United States is determined to continue its strong policy. Observers of Far Eastern issues believe that unless Germany can quickly win the war against the Soviet Union, Japan may have to find a way to avoid danger. Currently, it has Britain and the Netherlands Indies to the south, the United States to the east, and Chinese troops and Soviet Siberian troops to the west and north. At this time, Japan, situated among various countries, has no choice but to maintain its face through peaceful means. If Japan agrees to peace, Britain and the United States may be able to make some concessions, such as recognizing Japan's occupation of Vietnam, allowing its fishing rights in US territorial waters, and lifting the freeze on deposits. At that time, Japan will stop the war, abandon most of its invasion of China, and guarantee the maintenance of peace and good neighborly relations. Observers say that if the Pacific can be peaceful, Britain and the United States will achieve a diplomatic victory in the war. At that time, the war will only involve Germany. The US fleet can freely operate in the Atlantic to assist in Britain's victory. Observers also speculate that this negotiation and other possible consequences may be part of the "great strategy" agreed upon at the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting to eliminate Nazi tyranny.

Reuters, Tokyo, 29th – The Japanese authorities are still awaiting the results of Prime Minister Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt. The acting spokesman of the Information Bureau announced this morning that Japan is currently considering the issue of territorial sea boundaries. Another reporter asked whether there was a precedent for unilateral action to expand territorial waters. The spokesman replied that various countries have different disputes regarding the extent of territorial waters. For example, the Soviet Union had previously demanded that 12 miles be the limit of territorial waters, but Japan had never recognized it. The spokesman finally said that trade talks between Japan and the Dutch East Indies authorities are currently in progress. It was resolved that Amano had met with the Dutch Minister to Japan, Pabst, a few days ago.

International News Service, Washington, 29th – Japan has made a major decision regarding the United States today and has agreed to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis in the Far East. It is rumored that President Roosevelt, after receiving a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, has agreed to personally represent the United States in resolving the matter. According to interpretations from diplomatic circles, Japan's peace movement is due to Japan's obvious unwillingness to risk war with the United States in the Pacific. It is also said that even if Germany attempts to use Japan to divert US aid to Britain, Germany's hopes in that regard are very slim.

The Content of Konoe's Letter is Said to be of a Conciliatory Nature

United Press, Tokyo, 29th – Japan's Domei News Agency announced today that the content of Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt concerns the Imperial government's attitude toward the Pacific situation.

United Press, Tokyo, 29th – The East Asia Information Bureau officially announced today that Japanese Ambassador Nomura has delivered a letter from Konoe to President Roosevelt. The letter states Japan's beliefs regarding outstanding issues between Japan and the United States concerning the Pacific. At the same time, Cabinet Information Bureau Deputy Spokesman Ishii announced that the issue of the United States transporting military supplies, including aviation gasoline, to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok was also one of the issues discussed by President Roosevelt and Ambassador Nomura. Ishii refused to disclose further details. When asked whether Japan's protests to the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the United States' transport of goods to the Soviet Union were initiated by Japan or based on a request from the Axis powers, Ishii replied that the protest was made based on Japan's own views, "but I am not saying that the Axis powers were not taken into consideration when the protest was made."

Reuters, New York, 29th – According to a Washington dispatch, President Roosevelt will not continue to meet with Japanese Ambassador Nomura before replying to Konoe's letter. At the same time, diplomatic observers continue to speculate on the nature of Konoe's letter, believing that Konoe's letter may contain the surprising suggestion of personally meeting with the US President. Others believe that Konoe may propose that the United States, Japan, Britain, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands Indies, and China convene a meeting, and Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines may also be invited to participate. The simplest explanation for this matter made by various observers is that Konoe wants to find a way to have President Roosevelt, Hull, and Nomura hold continuous meetings to thoroughly explore the possibility of a peaceful compromise.

Reuters, New York, 29th – This morning, the New York Times Washington correspondent reported that it is generally believed that the letter from the Japanese Prime Minister to the US President is of a conciliatory nature. The New York Times reported that regarding the first voyage of the mail ship to the Soviet Union, there is only one possible decision. If Japan issues a warning about the safe passage of this mail ship or even takes any hostile action against it, it can only do so if it is already determined to take a step that will ultimately harm the people. The New York Herald Tribune also said that the United States must insist on (1) ending the damage to China's independence and commercial opportunities, (2) abandoning the entire process of southward expansion, and (3) abolishing the alliance with European barbarism.

Editorial

### The Threat of Youth Health Problems

News from various sources indicates that there has been no improvement in the physical fitness of young people in recent years, and an alarming proportion are weak. It is said that the results of physical examinations of students show that many suffer from lung disease, pleurisy, and other diseases. According to clinical observations, there is a growing trend of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis among young people. Although there are no complete statistics for research, superficially, the physical development of young people is not satisfactory. Leaving aside other things, just standing shoulder to shoulder with Western youth, one cannot help but feel ashamed of one's own inferiority, not in terms of academic ability or work, but in terms of physical appearance. Not only are Westerners generally taller than Chinese, but the development of their various body parts is also more complete. Their arms are full of muscles, their legs are shapely, and their skin is plump and rosy. They are upright and imposing, which cannot help but make people envious. Looking back at Chinese people, although there is no lack of strong and healthy individuals, the majority are sallow-faced and thin, often appearing somewhat sickly. While this may be partly due to skin color, their dryness and lack of spirit cannot be entirely attributed to skin color. In addition, there are those who are plump and large, but upon closer inspection, their structure reveals more fat than muscle, with flabby limbs and bellies, lacking curves and having a clumsy and waddling appearance. This can be described as fat, but not strong, as strength implies a solid body. Upon investigation, this is not due to inherent differences in physical constitution between Chinese and Westerners, but to unsuitable care, inadequate nutrition, and inappropriate training. Thus, although all humans, there are differences in strength and weakness, health and illness. This leads to an increase in the mortality rate of Chinese youth and children. Although there are no complete and reliable statistics, let us consider one example. According to the Qing imperial genealogy, from Qing Taizu Nurhaci to Emperor Wenzong (because Emperors Tongzhi and Guangxu had no offspring), a total of 194 children were born in nine generations, and those who died under the age of fifteen accounted for 39.7%. Even the children of the imperial family, with their comprehensive care and nutrition, still had such results. Although it is said that pampered individuals are often weak, the Qing dynasty prided itself on passing down its legacy through archery. From this, we can infer the situation among the common people. Deaths due to poor obstetrical techniques, inadequate care, and diseases, as well as the limitations of medical treatment, result in high mortality rates. According to statistics from the five major urban areas in China in 1934, those who died between the ages of one and fourteen accounted for 44%, and if those under the age of 39 are included, the figure rises to 65%, indicating that many do not live out their natural lifespan. Moreover, these statistics cannot be considered entirely accurate, yet they are already shocking. Therefore, if the Chinese nation could transform its old habits and improve all aspects of life, from production to education, achieving a state where all are born and nurtured, all are nurtured and develop, and all develop and are useful, I believe that the revival of the Chinese nation will result in it becoming the most outstanding and powerful nation in the world. Unfortunately, given the current situation, the Chinese nation not only cannot hope for this, but is instead becoming increasingly weak and declining, ultimately facing the risk of becoming a weak and dying race. Just speaking of this makes one's heart grow cold.

The unsuitable care is the fault of the parents. Modern parents, upon seeing their child cry, do not investigate the cause, but instead stuff food into their mouths to stop the crying, thinking that not crying equates to proper care. However, they do not realize that babies cry not only from hunger, but also from overeating or physical discomfort. Crying is a nonverbal expression and not always due to hunger. Using food to stop the crying almost always leads to indigestion and illness. Although there is an old saying, "If you want your child to be healthy, keep them slightly hungry," Chinese parents fail to put this into practice and continue to view overeating as the sole method of nurturing. There is also a reason for this, as Chinese people, when it comes to food, do not consider the nutritional content but only seek to increase the quantity, believing that more food means more nourishment, disregarding the enlargement of the stomach and intestines, fatigue from digestion, and the ease of developing illnesses. However, it is not as if they are unaware of the harm of overeating; the level of living is to blame. I once saw an American reporter say that a Chinese soldier's monthly salary is only equivalent to 45 cents in US dollars. Indeed, it is too little to be worth mentioning. However, how many salary earners in Shanghai, a city known for its prosperous industry and commerce, earn more than 20 US dollars a month? Most likely, it is between 5 and 10 US dollars, while the general price level implicitly rises with the black market exchange rate of the US dollar, compounded by the harm of hoarding and speculation, resulting in prices that are often ten or twenty times higher than before the war. With income and expenses balanced, it is difficult to make a living, and even more difficult to afford clothing, let alone milk, fruit, chicken, eggs, beef, and mutton as daily food. This greatly affects the development of young people. Just as a larva needs a large amount of food to grow, how can the development of young people not require adequate nutrition? With the difficulties of life as they are and the lack of nutrition as it is, to expect young people to have healthy physical development is like casting a line with bait and expecting to catch a fish that swallows the hook. This allows tuberculosis bacteria and the like to enter the bodies of young people, causing harm to the future of our nation. This is also a consequence of the difficulties of life and not just an individual physical problem.

Some believe that in that case, physical training of young people is still possible. However, the path of training is difficult, as cold water baths and swimming can strengthen the skin and resist wind and cold, but if not done properly, they can lead to death and illness. Practicing sports and exercising diligently can strengthen the body and bones, but if they are too intense, the harm will outweigh the benefits. Therefore, it is necessary to have this foundation from childhood and maintain it without loss to see effective results. This is something that Chinese people who care for children have always known, believing that "a cold head and cold feet are better than ginseng tonic," but unfortunately, they cannot achieve it in practice. If the Chinese nation remains weak and does not engage in training, judging from the survival of the fittest, how can it avoid being eliminated?

The great future undertakings of young people depend on their physical health. Now that there are various factors that can hinder the health of young people and cause them to weaken, become ill, and die, young people should strive to be careful about their diet, pay attention to hygiene, emphasize physical education, and exercise diligently in order to resist and cope with everything. It is important to know that all future academic disciplines will inevitably become more profound and therefore more difficult to learn, and the mechanical structures of the future will become more precise and therefore more difficult to use. Soaring tens of thousands of feet into the air is something that the bodies of Chinese people may not be able to handle. Diving thousands of feet into the depths of the ocean is something that Chinese people may not be able to endure. These are all extremely common things today, and Chinese people must have this ability. Unfortunately, there are still some young students in Shanghai who, at the time when they should be striving for advanced studies, cannot overcome their momentary desires or are willing to be seduced by external things, surrendering to the environment instead of transforming it, living a dissolute life, harming their bodies, depleting their spirits, and ruining their future. How can this not be regrettable? In light of the increasingly serious problem of youth health, which is not just a concern for one person or one family but is of great importance, it is hoped that young people and their parents will pay attention to and be warned by this, which is truly a blessing for the future of the nation.

### Japan Holds Emergency Cabinet Meeting to Exchange Views on the Situation

Reuters, Tokyo, 29th – Immediately following this afternoon's emergency cabinet meeting, the official announcement of Konoe's letter to the US President was made, but details were not disclosed. From the official viewpoint, it is difficult to determine whether the emergency cabinet meeting was related to this letter. However, it is noteworthy that Terasaki, Director of the American Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, attended the cabinet meeting, explained the recent US-Japan relations, and specifically mentioned the important meeting between President Roosevelt and Nomura. Another matter also contains significant meaning, namely that the Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau, Rear Admiral Oka, and the Director of the Army Affairs Bureau, Major General Akita, also participated in this cabinet meeting.

United Press, Tokyo, 29th – The cabinet held an emergency meeting, chaired by Konoe. In addition to all cabinet members, the attendees included Muto, Director of the Army Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, and Terasaki, Director of the American Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Domei News Agency reported that at the beginning of the cabinet meeting, Terasaki explained the recent relations between Japan and the United States and specifically mentioned the important meeting held between Nomura and President Roosevelt. Afterwards, Konoe and Foreign Minister Toyoda supplemented Terasaki's report, detailing the relations between Japan and the United States and the meetings held in Washington. After listening to the report, the cabinet fully exchanged views on the situation.

### Japan Believes US Aid to China is Equivalent to a Military Alliance

United Press, Tokyo, 29th – The Nichinichi Shimbun published a speech by Navy Information Bureau Major Tominaga, stating that the United States' goal is to control the Pacific. Tominaga broadcast to the nation last night, saying that the United States is the leader of the anti-Japanese encirclement camp. He said that the armed strength of this camp, not including Chongqing, includes 300 warships, 1,250 aircraft, and more than 250,000 troops. Tominaga pointed out that the encirclement group "is gradually closing in on us, so the development we require is our serious concern and should be paid attention to." Tominaga believes that the US military delegation going to Chongqing is a prelude to the United States becoming more active in the Far East. Tominaga said, "We can directly recognize that the United States has actually formed a military alliance with Chongqing."

Chongqing, 28th – A government spokesman said that the Chinese government welcomes President Roosevelt's decision to send a military delegation to China. The US President's decision demonstrates his sincere desire to strengthen Sino-US cooperation and achieve fully satisfactory results in the aid to China policy. The appointment of General Magruder as the head of the delegation is particularly appropriate.

### US President Orders Reorganization of National Defense Production Agencies; Establishes a Seven-Member Committee to Handle Everything, Including Aid to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union

United Press, Washington, 29th – President Roosevelt yesterday reorganized the National Defense Production Agencies, effectively creating a supply department and granting all priority rights to a seven-member committee led by Vice President Wallace. This move will eliminate the competition for authority between the Office of Production Management and the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply, and will also eliminate obstacles and accelerate the entire military buildup. The President appointed Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Nelson, Hillman, Henderson, and Hopkins as members of the committee. The President's order also included the following changes: (1) Abolishing the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply and sending Henderson to London as a minister to cooperate with Harriman; (2) Hopkins also obtained a new title, namely the highest-ranking Lend-Lease Act executive under the President; (3) Removing Stettinius from his position as Director of Priorities in the Office of Production Management and appointing him as a Lend-Lease Act executive under Hopkins; (4) Removing Nelson from his position as Director of Procurement in the Office of Production Management and appointing him as a Director of the Supply Priorities and Allocations Board. Nelson will henceforth be the most powerful person in the priority system, as Wallace is only the nominal leader. According to the President's plan, the newly organized committee will allocate US resources into the following four categories: (1) Domestic military needs; (2) Supply of weapons to Britain, the Soviet Union, and China; (3) Non-defense civilian needs; (4) Economic warfare needs, especially those related to Latin America. The President firmly reserved the right to make the final decision on the allocation of goods and weapons and the proportion to be transported to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. According to observers, the plan was drafted by New York Judge Rosenman, a friend of the President, after a direct policy conflict arose between Nelson of the Office of Production Management, who advocated reducing automobile production by 26 percent, and Henderson of the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply, who demanded an immediate reduction of 50 percent.

### 500 US-Made Tanks Delivered to Britain

### Pan American Committee Announces Use of Foreign Ships to Enhance Security of the New World; US Agrees to Recognize Such Transfers

Reuters, Washington, 29th – The Pan American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee has announced that the 21 republics of the Americas will use foreign ships idle in ports throughout the Western Hemisphere.

According to the announcement of the Pan American Committee, fair and full compensation will be given for the requisitioned foreign ships. The purpose of this move is to enhance the economic defense of the American republics and the security of the New World. The US government has agreed to recognize such transfers of ships and to waive its belligerent rights over these ships. According to reliable sources, there are a total of 100 foreign ships idle in various parts of the Americas.

Havas Agency, Washington, 28th – The Pan American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee, which has been studying the issue of requisitioning foreign ships moored in ports of the Americas for a long time, decided today that all 21 republics of the Americas will use foreign ships. Therefore, the problem of the shortage of ships in Pan American territorial waters can be solved. In addition, many foreign ships are specially prepared for transporting American arms to Britain.

### US President Appoints Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air

British Export Ban to China Aimed at Strengthening the Exchange Stabilization Fund

London: The British Board of Trade recently ordered that all exports to China, except those passing through Burma, should be prohibited. It is reported that the main purpose of this move by the United Kingdom is to strengthen the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund. The British side believes that although the Exchange Stabilization Fund cannot stop the import of goods into Shanghai, it can still control the quantity of import trade in Shanghai by restricting the application for foreign exchange. It is said that the reason why goods are still being imported into Shanghai is because the British authorities are still approving a small number of pounds. Therefore, the Exchange Stabilization Fund should find ways to control China's import trade. There are two ways: (1) Restrictions should be placed on the application for foreign exchange for goods that have not been approved for import. (2) If British exporters wish to ship non-urgent goods to China, the British authorities should restrict the issuance of licenses. In addition, the Exchange Stabilization Fund should strive to manage the foreign exchange value of the legal tender. (28th Dispatch)

### Soviet Union, Regardless of Major Sacrifices, Blows Up Dnieper River Mega Dam, Floodwaters Spread Hundreds of Miles, Supplies to German-Occupied Areas Completely Cut Off

Reuters, Moscow, 29th: Soviet government spokesman Lozovsky officially announced that the Dniepropetrovsk hydroelectric dam, the largest in Europe, has been blown up. This dam, located on the Dnieper River, was destroyed in what is the most shocking act of destruction by the Russians since the burning of Moscow in 1812. The plant took eight years to build and supplied electricity to a vast agricultural and industrial area on both sides of the Dnieper River. It was the highest symbol of Soviet industrial civilization. When announcing the destruction of the dam, Lozovsky said that the Soviet Union did not want this great engineering achievement to fall into the hands of fascist bandits and therefore destroyed it. The Soviet government and the entire population are determined to fight to make the strength of the German vehicles weaker and weaker, and not to have the German army gain strength with every place it occupies, as in the Western Front. The German army in Soviet territory will never be able to obtain raw materials, food, or machinery.

Associated Press, Moscow, 29th: The Soviet Union's destruction of the Dnieper River left bank dam and large hydroelectric plant is enough to show that the Soviet government has engaged in unlimited sacrifices in order to stop the German advance. The Red Army's destruction of this large power plant and dam seems to be carried out in accordance with Stalin's scorched earth policy, because it did not hesitate to destroy this hydroelectric plant and dam, the largest in Europe and a stunning construction of the Soviet Union. These two major constructions consumed a great deal of Soviet manpower and resources. The hydroelectric plant began construction in 1927 and was completed in 1932. At the time of completion, a grand opening ceremony was held, which opened a new era of Soviet industrialization and electrification. It is said that Soviet figures also used the construction of this large power plant to illustrate the essence of what Lenin called, "Soviet power plus electrification equals communism." In this great construction, American engineer Cooper served as the highest consultant, and there were also many other American engineers, technicians, mechanics, and consultants involved.

Reuters, London, 29th: Moscow mentions the bombing of the Dnieper River dam, saying that the Nazis are facing an area flooded by hundreds of gallons, and the supply to the occupied areas downstream of the Dnieper River will be completely cut off.

Soviet Union Admits Loss of Key City, Main Force of Red Army Safely Withdraws East

Reuters, Moscow, 29th: A Reuters reporter wired that the Soviet Union's admission of the loss of Dnepropetrovsk has strengthened the determination of the people here, because the city is of great importance to the industrial progress of the Soviet Union. The city was abandoned after a bloody battle. It has been more than two weeks since the German army captured Kirovograd. This time factor proves that the German propaganda two weeks ago that General Derni's main force in southern Ukraine had been completely defeated was an exaggeration. The bulk of Derni's main force had ample time to cross the Dnieper River and firmly defend the left bank.

TASS, Moscow, 29th: The Soviet Information Bureau issued a battle report as follows: "On the night of the 27th and the morning of the 28th, our army fought fiercely with the enemy on the northern Kimchitzepur, the central Gomel, and the southern Dnepropetrovsk and Odessa fronts." The bureau's night battle report stated, "On the 28th, our army fought fiercely with the enemy along the entire front. After fierce fighting on the Dnieper River, our army withdrew from the city of Dnepropetrovsk." (Editor's note: Dnepropetrovsk is the center of heavy industry in the Ukrainian Republic, located on the west bank of the Dnieper River.)

Red Army Counter-Offensive Successful in Central Region, Annihilates Elite German Division

Reuters, London, 29th: Moscow Radio broadcast last night that the Soviet army led by General Konev is continuing its counter-offensive in the central region and has been quite successful. In the battles of the past few days, it has annihilated a German division, seized its artillery, and destroyed its headquarters. Three thousand German officers and soldiers were killed, 130 tanks were destroyed, and 100 vehicles were destroyed. German reinforcements have rushed to the front, but have not regained their lost territory. On Tuesday, a Soviet unit under General Konev repelled four determined German attacks. The Soviet army also seized German documents revealing that the German army in this area was in a difficult situation, and German prisoners also admitted that ammunition was short and that manpower and material resources had suffered major losses.

Germany Claims Capture of Estonian Capital Tallinn, Canal Sluices Blown Up by Soviets

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 29th: It was announced here this morning that the naval bases of the Soviet Union in Tallinn and Paldiski in Estonia have been captured by the German army. In Tallinn, 19 Soviet transport ships, one destroyer, and many other warships were sunk, and the Soviet heavy cruiser "Kirov" and one destroyer were destroyed.

International News Agency, Berlin, 29th: Military authorities here said today that German and Finnish troops have virtually completed their encirclement of Leningrad. German troops are now only 30 miles from the southern suburbs of the city.

Rainy Season Arrives in Leningrad, German Offensive Has Been Halted

Associated Press, Moscow, 29th: The German attempt to cut off the Moscow-Leningrad railway has failed. Soviet officials said that General Konev had launched a successful attack on the central front for twelve days, is currently continuing to advance, and has recaptured several towns. The rainy season has arrived, and Leningrad is surrounded by rain, with everything submerged in the water, making defense more convenient. Therefore, the German blitzkrieg strategy has been thwarted, and the ongoing Nazi mechanized troops have been stopped.

Reuters, London, 29th: German radio said that German troops had crossed the Moscow-Leningrad railway in many places, and traffic between the two cities had been cut off.

Reuters, London, 29th: The German official news agency reported military news that the Baltic Sea section of the Soviet-German front will have a significant military outcome. It is expected that the result will be to drive the Soviet army out of the Baltic Sea region, and that the German army advancing from the south and southeast is 50 miles from Leningrad. The Soviet and German armies are now vying for the naval base of Tallinn and the ports of the Baltic Sea, which are expected to be captured soon. The Finnish advance on the Karelian Isthmus between Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland continues to make the defense of Leningrad more difficult, and Vyborg has already been besieged. Once Tallinn falls, Soviet communication with the outposts in this area will be completely cut off. The Italian official news agency also issued a lengthy statement, saying that those from the "war zone" stated that the Soviet army's continued resistance was because the Soviet command had now discovered that if it ordered a general retreat, it would only force its troops to fight a bloody battle.

Soviet Military and Civilians Unite to Resist, Fierce Fighting Around Odessa

Reuters, London, 29th: Moscow Radio broadcast that in the Odessa area, a Soviet armored train broke through the German lines and penetrated deep into the enemy rear. Fierce fighting is currently taking place around Odessa, where not only the Soviet army is bravely defending its positions, but also the entire population is working to defend the city. Workers and staff have formed special forces and are bravely fighting. The workers are extremely active and have created two armored trains, one of which is fully loaded with troops and has rushed into the enemy rear, making many gains. The authorities have issued a special appeal, instructing Odessa to defend to the end, saying that Odessa is currently under major threat, but the people of the city clearly do not need this kind of advice and are all rising up to defend the city. Shops in the city are still open, and the rest of the residents are participating in the defense work.

### Iranian King Orders Ceasefire Against Britain and Soviet Union; Reportedly, Britain and Soviet Union Offer Eight Conditions; Peace Negotiations Underway

Reuters, Simla, 29th - This morning, a communique was released here stating that Iranian representatives have met with the advance troops of the British army and informed them that the King of Iran has ordered a ceasefire.

Reuters, Ankara, 29th - The people of Turkey are pleased with the news that the Iranian government has ordered a ceasefire, believing that this unexpected event has come to an end. Moreover, the British occupation can guarantee another supply route for Turkey. Currently, the United States can provide support to Turkey from Iran, Iraq, and Syria if needed. It is reported that the Iranian Ambassador to Turkey recently earnestly requested Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu to mediate with Britain and the Soviet Union on his behalf. However, now that the resistance has ended, all issues can be resolved in Tehran, and this mediation seems unnecessary.

United Press, Datta, 29th - Reports from Tehran and other cities indicate that the peace agreement between Britain, the Soviet Union, and Iran is underway after the collapse of the Tehran cabinet.

Havas, New Delhi, 28th - According to news from the capital of Turkey, the military authorities of Britain and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement with the Iranian government regarding the complete handover of all German nationals within Iranian territory to the Allied forces of Britain and the Soviet Union.

Reuters, Simla, 29th - A communique declared that when the British Indian troops in the northern region advanced towards Shahabad yesterday, they encountered Iranian troops retreating to Kırmanşah who raised a flag to cease hostilities. The Iranian commander requested that if given a deadline until September 1, they would withdraw and surrender the city. The British commander, having learned from prisoners that Germans in Kırmanşah were planning defensive strategies for the Iranian troops, resolutely refused this delaying tactic and insisted that the Iranian troops immediately begin to withdraw from their defensive positions. In the southern region, Indian infantry continued to advance along both banks of the Karun River towards Ahvaz, which has now been occupied by British forces. The British Air Force provided cover for the British vanguard troops in the aforementioned military operations. It is also reported that a column of fresh Soviet troops has arrived in Dilman (west of Lake Urmia) and is continuing to advance south. Local residents said that the Iranian troops had begged them for food. British policy is to help the Persian people with food to alleviate the general shortage. Since the beginning of military operations, they have managed to transport 700 tons of wheat into southern Iran, which is occupied by British forces.

Iranian Parliament Trusts Government

Reuters, London, 29th - According to Tehran Radio, the Iranian Parliament unanimously passed a vote of confidence after the new Prime Minister Foroughi explained the peace policy. The new Prime Minister introduced the new cabinet members and reported on recent developments in a special session of Parliament, stating, "I have been appointed to form a cabinet, and the new government is now presented to Parliament. The King's intentions for the reform and progress of the country are contained in the procedures submitted to Parliament by previous governments, which Members of Parliament must already know. Therefore, the current government feels there is no need to elaborate on its political program. Only one thing is worth telling you: we will do our best to maintain good relations with foreign countries, especially neighboring countries, and continue to improve them. This is the goal of the King and Parliament. The Iranian government and people have always supported peace and reconciliation with other parts of the world. To make the world understand this intention, it is hereby declared that when the governments of Britain and the Soviet Union order certain actions, the Iranian government, in accordance with the King's policy of loving peace, has ordered its domestic troops not to offer any resistance, so that the causes of bloodshed and disturbance can be avoided, and public peace and security can be maintained. In this environment where the whole country is concerned about current developments, we naturally hope that effective steps have already been taken immediately to maintain friendly relations with neighboring governments, thanks to the complete trust of the people in the government's peaceful intentions. Now that the new cabinet has been formed, coupled with the people's trust in the current government, this hope will surely increase."

People here believe that the real reason for Papen's request to meet with the Turkish President was to offset the impression created by the Turkish President's reception of British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen yesterday. Papen is currently suffering from kidney stones. The German side has acknowledged that he will soon leave office for treatment, or may go to Vienna for surgery.

### One Week of Battle Situation: August 22nd to 28th

Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that, based on a comprehensive review of the battle situation on various fronts this week, both Japan and China launched attacks against each other. The Japanese army recklessly launched offensives against the areas where the Chinese field armies posed a threat to their salient points, attempting to inflict blows on the Chinese army, but they were all repelled with losses. Examples include the Battle of Jìwáng Mountain north of Pucheng, the Battle of Guān Yuán Gǔ north of Fuzhou, and the Battle of Nièjiā River north of Yuezhou. The Chinese army, on the other hand, planned their actions carefully, so they were able to conquer every place their sharp forces pointed to. Examples include Fuqing south of Fuzhou, Gaochun south of Nanjing, Baiguan northwest of Shangyu, and Keqiao northwest of Shaoxing. Those areas that did not need to be permanently held according to strategy were evacuated immediately after defeating the Japanese, such as Wukang north of Hangzhou and Yuhang west of Hangzhou. The so-called "Japan becomes weaker with each battle, while the Chinese army becomes stronger with each battle" is the most obvious example of this. The detailed process is described as follows: (A) Japanese Stupidity; (1) Jìwáng Mountain is a major stronghold of the Chinese army's salient southwestern triangle area. The Japanese traffic arteries in the southern section of the Datong-Pukou Railway and the rivers in the nearby counties were severely threatened. Therefore, starting on the 12th, the Japanese forces from Jìhù, Héjīn, Wànquán, Lèhé, Línjìn, Wénxǐ, Xiàxiàn, Ānyì, and other places, totaling more than 4,000 troops, attacked Jìwáng Mountain in eight routes, attempting to eliminate the Chinese army. The Chinese army gave them a head-on blow, and after fierce fighting until the 14th, most of the Japanese army was repelled. The Japanese fled westward in disarray, and the Chinese continued to pursue them, carrying out a counter-sweep; (2) The Japanese army at the mouth of the Min River north of Dongkou launched an attack on the Guānkǒu Guān Yuán Gǔ area on the morning of the 25th. The Chinese army gave them a head-on blockage. The Japanese suffered many casualties in the fighting until 2 p.m., and the Japanese retreated back to Dongkou. The Chinese were still in pursuit; (3) The Japanese in the Yueyang area seemed to be planning some action, and also fearing that the Chinese army on the north bank of the Yangtze River would pursue them, the Japanese at Báilú Mountain went through Nièjiā River to Liújiā River on the morning of the 22nd to seek out the Chinese field army and try to inflict blows on them. As a result, the Japanese suffered heavy losses instead.

(B) Chinese Raids on the Japanese: The Chinese field armies in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi simultaneously launched small-scale attacks on the Japanese salient points on the 25th. (1) On the evening of the 25th, the Chinese launched an attack on the Japanese forces in Fuqing City. By daybreak, the Japanese could not hold out and fled towards the harbor. The Chinese recaptured Fuqing City; (2) The Chinese launched an attack on Nanchang south of Yuyao, killing many Japanese soldiers; (3) The Chinese launched a fierce attack on the Baiguan Township northwest of Shangyu, killing many Japanese soldiers; (4) The Chinese army launched attacks on the Japanese strongholds around Shaoxing in several routes, with one route attacking the southwestern city of Shaoxing, one route attacking Keqiao Town and Nan Ke Mountain, and one route attacking Dongguan Town in the eastern suburbs. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties; (5) A certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Yuhang City on the 25th, killing many Japanese soldiers. At dawn, they turned to attack the Japanese at Phoenix Mountain southwest of the city, capturing many supplies; (6) Another unit of the Chinese army attacked Wukang City at dawn on the 26th, once breaking into the city, killing many Japanese soldiers and capturing a large amount of military supplies; (7) The Chinese army launched attacks on the Japanese forces in the suburbs of Changxing City. The Japanese forces at Wǔfēng Mountain, Jiápǔ, and Géxī were also attacked by the Chinese; (8) The Chinese attacked Màozi Ridge west of Guichi, killing many Japanese soldiers and destroying many Japanese fortifications; (9) The Chinese attacked the Japanese forces at Yangkǒu Mountain south of Dongliu, capturing many supplies; (10) The Chinese launched attacks on the Japanese forces at Rìkǒu, Prince's Hall, and Tángxī outside Nanchang, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese. On the 26th, the Chinese continued to attack the Japanese in front of them in several routes. (1) The Chinese launched attacks on the Japanese forces at Wángjiā Mountain, Hǔzhǎo Mountain, and Wūguī Mountain south of Xiaoshan City, killing many Japanese soldiers and capturing many supplies; (2) The Chinese captured Gaochun City in one fell swoop, killing and wounding hundreds of Japanese soldiers. The Chinese are still fighting against the Japanese in the Confucius Temple area east of the city; (3) The Chinese launched attacks on the Japanese forces at Wānzhǐ, Jiǔlǐ Mountain, and Hóngxī Town. Fighting is still ongoing (29th Dispatch).

### Food: Although the Rice Market is Not Surrounded on All Sides, the Situation Appears to Be Unfavorable; Its Fate Can Only Be Judged by Observing the Shift in the Situation

Yesterday, the foreign rice market rose and fell again due to unfavorable environmental factors. Many newcomers dared not get involved. The peel-ball gang, holding the goods in hand, became fearful and devalued them. In addition, the rice stored by the Shanghai Municipal Council was still being sold at a flat price. The public sale price at the retail outlets was 120 yuan, which was higher than the market price and was difficult to sustain for long. Yesterday, it was rumored that the price would be reduced by 4 yuan, which made the rice merchants even more worried. Since the ABCD group was led by the United States, followed by the Luoqiu Conference, Britain and the United States have a deeper alliance in the Far East, and the United States and the Soviet Union have formed a circle in the northwestern corner of the Pacific. Thus, there is a large encirclement, with no gaps to take advantage of. So they had to bow to the old Luo and knock on the White House door to try to save face and seek further progress in the south, which is very slim. Even if they take the risk, it will not be difficult to solve it on the spot. Therefore, the southern advance that rice merchants have been hoping for day and night for half a year is unlikely to be realized. The rice in their hands, if accumulated for a long time, is not the right way. Therefore, the speculative atmosphere suddenly felt a killing, and the speculative heart of the market was discouraged. This is why the rice price has been hovering for the past few days. Furthermore, if foreign exchange controls are once put into practice, buying Saigon rice may be a problem, but buying Hong Kong small-grain rice and Dutch Indian rice is not only not a problem, but also the supply is higher than the black market exchange rate. The cost is low and the rice price is naturally cheap, which will give the Shanghai rice in storage a deep blow and make the rice merchants lose their justification for manipulating and hoarding. Thirdly, although the Shanghai rice price has loosened, the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang not only do not supply rice to Shanghai, but instead transport foreign rice into Shanghai to deal with price equalization. Now, the early Indica rice has already been put on the market, and the local market price is from 70 to 80 yuan to 50 to 60 yuan. The mainland does not need Shanghai's assistance, or it can be divided into a part of Shanghai, which gives the Shanghai rice merchants another threat. What's more, the rice in storage in Shanghai has been accumulating day by day, only seeing it increase. The rice arriving in Shanghai is constant every day, only seeing it abundant. At this point, rice merchants are afraid that they will cut their own rice, and the peel-ball will kick into their own door. Those who throw the top of the palace may lose the wind, but this is still too early to say. We have to wait for a few more days to see the shift in the situation before we can make a judgment on the rice market. Therefore, after the mid-market yesterday, it stepped down and down, and fell weakly until the closing, falling by more than 2 yuan. The price of No. 1 Saigon rice was 131 yuan and 130 yuan. The price of No. 2 rice was 120 yuan. The price of No. 2 Siam rice was 115.5 yuan to 113 yuan. The price of Min rice in Zhongguan was from 120 yuan to 117 yuan. The price of Dutch Buddha rice was 127 to 8 yuan. The price of small-grain rice from the Bank Warehouse was initially from 117.5 yuan, and later only 115.5 yuan. The price of foreign rice from foreign warehouses fell from 118 yuan to 114 yuan. The price of broken tips was from 93 yuan, and then to 88.5 yuan. The remaining goods were unable to be opened. The price of small-grain British China Silk was 142 yuan, and the price of Luli was 142.5 yuan, and the current price was 139 yuan. The price of No. 2 Siam rice was 132 yuan and 131.5 yuan. The transaction volume of British China Silk was only 300 to 400 tons, and the existing rice was less than 10,000 bags.

Foreign rice arrived one after another. The French postal ship Datdan arrived at the port yesterday morning, carrying 2,700 tons of foreign rice from Saigon, about 27,500 bags. It was berthed at floating pier 11 and 12 for unloading. There are 2,000 bags of foreign rice in this city loaded on the Taikoo Company's Yuezhou wheel, which will be exported to Tianjin tomorrow (Zu).

Thick and thin japonica rice and Nantong early rice arrived daily. The local hometown shops have a strong appetite, and it seems that they do not intend to allocate them, resulting in rare goods to live in, and the selling price continues to be outstanding, rising by a huge 3 yuan, totaling 160 yuan and 158 yuan. Although there is not much Wuxi white japonica rice in the market, the market is sluggish. Only medium and second-grade old japonica rice is traded at 147 yuan to 145 yuan, slightly tight. The new japonica rice in Pudong has frequent rain, making it difficult to sell out, so only a dozen loads of goods arrived, so the price is on par with the early rice, rising by about 3 yuan, opening at 160 yuan and 158 yuan. The domestic goods of glutinous rice are still extinct, and only Hong Kong goods are traded. The overall market situation is still similar in supply and demand, with no honor or disgrace. The high-priced goods continued to open at 129 yuan, the second at 125 yuan, the glutinous lu at 116 yuan, and the second at 111 yuan.

### US Flour Price Confirmation; Reduced Flour Transactions

Yesterday's spot foreign flour market was driven by actual sales in this street, moving without kicking. Guest helpers who re-export are watching and not moving forward. Speculators, in view of the cumbersome procedures for buying and selling foreign flour, and the tight and loose rice prices, and the confirmation of the news of the US flour price opening, are increasingly hesitant. However, the bulls are not in a hurry to sell out, resulting in fewer transactions in the market. The total transaction volume was less than 20,000 bags. The price of Jinlong flour was 31 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen to 7 jiao. The price of Battery flour was 33 yuan 2 jiao. The price of Clock Tower flour was 34 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen. The selling prices of all goods were uniformly flat and tired. In addition, 4,000 bags of flour will be transported to Tianjin today.

Yesterday's wheat transaction was even quieter, because the weather was rainy, and the near-effect source was extremely scarce. The factories that wanted to collect the goods did not change the purchase price either. The market transaction was even more stagnant.

### Oil Beans Live in Oddity; Don't Know When to Stop

In the edible oil market, the situation of raw soybean oil turned flat yesterday, but the prices of rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil are still rising steadily due to the speculators' sole intention to push up the prices, and the prices have risen by 5, 6, and 7 yuan compared with the previous day. The total market sales opened with more than 2,000 dans of Qing oil from Dayou Factory, and the price was 199 yuan to 200 yuan. In addition, 200 yuan to 203 yuan was traded in the lower delivery in September. 100 dans of rapeseed oil from Dayou Factory, the price was 200 yuan. More than 3,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from Rihua Factory, the spot price was 192 yuan, 202 yuan to 201 yuan was traded in the upper delivery in September, and 203 yuan to 207 yuan was traded in the lower delivery in September. More than 400 barrels of rapeseed oil from Taishan Factory, the spot price was 192 yuan, and 199 yuan to 200 yuan was traded in the lower delivery in September. The Taikoo Company's New Beijing wheel returned to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday afternoon, carrying 6,973 cans of raw oil and 3,790 cans of soybean oil.

There have been lump sums of soybeans arriving from Tianjin recently, totaling 20,000 bags (5,523 bags were loaded by New Beijing). However, the owners are unwilling to sell them easily, so the market price is difficult to be cheap. Yesterday, nearly 1,000 bags of returned soybeans were handled by the street and the hoarders. 200 bags of Jiaozhou and Qingkou soybeans each, and the price was raised by half a yuan to a yuan compared to the previous day.

### Finance: Black Market Exchange Rate is Waiting for the Hong Kong Meeting to Decide; Yesterday's Transaction Was There, But There Was No Market

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC rates remained flat, and there was little change in the British and American exchange rates in HSBC's small counter. The managers of the Anglo-American Exchange, McKay and Lee, went to Hong Kong to participate in the second meeting of the Equalization Fund, fearing further developments. The small counter prices of Citibank and Chase Bank have not been returned. Chinese and foreign brokers are unwilling to sell on behalf of them in order to avoid danger. Chinese merchants are watching, and import foreign firms are also waiting for instructions after the meeting. Therefore, although the foreign exchange rate of the United States against Britain rose by 25 points, and the United States against Shanghai increased by 2 points, it was not affected. The asking price at the morning opening was 2875 points for the US exchange, 4 yuan 84375 for the US dollar, and the silver standard tax was still collected at 24.50 percent. According to the forecast of the meeting, there will be satisfactory and good methods, so the asking price of various market prices is that the British gold at noon is 2890625 points and the US dollar is 4 yuan 875 points, which are all actually released by the bank, and the price is slightly loose.

The afternoon was even more silent.

The afternoon was even quieter. Until the closing price of 3 yuan and a half, the spot price until the September period was 2890620 points for the British Exchange and 4 yuan 875 points for the US Exchange, an increase of 0.015625 points for the British and 0.03125 points for the US compared with the closing price of the previous day.

### Securities Helps to Lower Cash; Clearing Chips at the End of August; Today's Settlement Price According to US Exchange

Yesterday's gold market's red dark market, the September period stopped trading, waiting for a certain party to instruct the settlement. As for the clearing chips at the end of August, the settlement price will be the US exchange price at HSBC's small counter this morning, so yesterday's gold market was only doing spot trading, presenting a trend of rising first and then falling, which was suppressed by the huge sales of the securities help.

Spot Squeezes Small 60 Yuan

From the beginning of the morning, it was raised by 30 yuan. Mingfeng first entered 50 liang of Tianyuan, and the price was 9,280 yuan. It was heard that there was a transaction of 10 to 20 liang at 9,290 yuan. It soon fell. Fukangyong released 30 liang of Tianyuan for 9,240 yuan. Yifeng sold 20 liang to Jinyuan for 9,230 yuan, and then released 50 liang to Yongcheng for 9,210 yuan.

It was released soon after, but the price was already within 9,200 yuan, selling 20 liang to Lao Tian Shi for 9,180 yuan. Defu started to sell small again to 9,170 yuan. The silversmith industry continued to absorb it, and it was seen to return.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Advance, Foreign Stocks Active, English and French Properties & Xiangtai Timber Declare Special Dividends and Bonuses

The grey market for public bonds continued to rise yesterday. Category C bonds broke through the 70-yuan mark. Achieving such a high price after the dividend is truly commendable. Speculation and short covering were extremely enthusiastic in the market, but spot goods from the financial sector continued to flow out. Sales from entities such as the Farmers Bank of China, Jincheng Bank, Guohuo Bank, and Zhongfu Bank were significant. Absorption was even more widespread, mostly by smaller money shops. However, the closing market seemed weaker, and a pullback is expected today. Yesterday morning, the Xin Fu firm bought aggressively, and Le Mao covered a large short position. Sheng Chang, Da Zhong, Ren Feng, and Jiu Cheng also bought. Although Run De, Xie He, Yuan Lian Yi, Lian He, and San De, representing the financial sector, sold heavily, the high price still broke through the 70-yuan mark. Category E broke through to 8 yuan, and Category D also broke through 7 yuan, showing a quite firm trend. In the afternoon, Xin Fu continued to buy, and Xin Hua, Run De, and Hong Da also bought. Tong Kang, Yi Tai, Tong Shun, Zhong Fu, and Heng Kang sold very actively. Category C once reached a high price of 70 yuan and 8 jiao, and retreated slightly by 4 jiao at closing.

The opening price was 91.5 yuan, then gradually declined to 84 yuan, and closed at 86.5 yuan. Jardine Matheson also had high trading volume, with a high price of 104 yuan, closing at 103.5 yuan, up 5.5 yuan. Trading in other prominent stocks was also active, and the closing trend was extremely strong. Rubber stocks continued to rise, with large volumes traded in each stock.

The Mercantile Bank of India shares alone decreased by 2 shillings and 6 pence to a price of 9 pounds, 2 shillings, and 6 pence. There were no other changes.

### Yarn and Cotton: Sudden Turmoil in the Yarn Market; Sellers Arrive One after Another

The yarn market continued to weaken, and the trend turned downwards. This was because the need for unified yarn by the Hong Gang was relatively quiet, and news was unfavorable for long positions. In addition, there were various rumors that greatly impacted Shuangma Mill. As a result, short sellers became very active, and the market became unstable and fell. However, some well-funded entities came back to buy. Once a false trend starts, it is difficult to contain. As for the situation of Japanese yarn, the opening was firm, but it had fallen back by closing. The exchange had no market for delivery, but people predicted a loosening step. The high price for 20-count Shuangma was 1723 yuan, the low price was 1690 yuan, and the closing price was 1693 yuan.

Shuangma opened in the morning with weak sentiment. The opening price was 1720 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1723 yuan. Subsequently, rumors spread that were all unfavorable to the long side. Selling was more prevalent. The price loosened to 1711 yuan, fluctuating between 12 and 13 yuan for a long time. At the same time, actual trading was sluggish, and entry and exit on the trading floor were particularly slow. Everyone mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Unexpectedly, after 11 o'clock, rumors suddenly arose in the market, saying that the Japanese cabinet had changed, and that Osaka Sanpin Yarn had a limit down. As a result, sellers arrived one after another. The trading floor, which had been stagnant for a long time, underwent a great change. It fell sharply to 1690 yuan. However, profit-takers took the opportunity to buy, and the closing price recovered slightly, resulting in a price of 1693 yuan. It was found that the total volume of transactions in half a day was 7,465 bales. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows: Hong Kong 465 bales, and fellow traders 7,000 bales.

The Jin Shuangma market yesterday handled the August futures delivery and closed the market. There was no news. The August futures opened on June 2 at a starting price of 1387 yuan. On the 4th, it was slightly lower at 1370 yuan. On July 28, it was as high as 1552 yuan. The final closing was 1489 yuan, which was 102 yuan higher than the initial price. The difference between the high and low prices was 282 yuan. The delivery price was determined by averaging the book prices of the last three days, which was 1528 yuan. As of the 20th, there were 920 outstanding transactions, of which 660 were actually delivered. Deliveries were mostly of No. 60, No. 61, No. 63, and No. 70 yarns. Receipts were mostly of No. 4, No. 17, and No. 29 yarns. The delivered products included 330 bales of 10-count Rainbow Baby Yi, 390 bales of 10-count Boy Scout, 30 bales of 16-count Vega, and 10 bales of 16-count Earth. The opening, closing, high, and low prices of August futures are listed on the left (net prices):

Initial Price 1387.00

Highest Price 1552.00

Lowest Price 1370.00

Closing Price 1489.00

Delivery Price 1528.00

Increase from Initial Price 102.00

Foreign Cotton Purchases Have Been High for Several Days

### Interest Slightly Reduced

The current cotton market is still firm. Trading in coarse and fine foreign cotton follows the usual pattern, without showing any signs of fatigue. Although yarn and cloth prices are trending down and margin money has fallen, people's sentiment is not affected by this. The selling prices of spot cotton yesterday are listed on the left.

The New York cotton market initially rose due to poor cotton crop conditions, with active buying by traders and from New Orleans. However, it subsequently fell back due to selling by Southern firms and profit-taking. As a result, yesterday's closing price was approximately 6 to 7 points lower than the previous day. The Indian cotton market initially rose due to buying by speculators and firm prices in other domestic markets. However, it subsequently fell due to public selling and tensions in the Near East. Yesterday's closing price was approximately 1 rupee higher.

It is predicted that today's opening market will fall by 1.5 rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade was quieter, seemingly because there had been sufficient purchases in recent days, and interest had weakened. Yesterday, only about 500 bales of Indian cotton and Brazilian cotton were traded.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Futures Also Quiet, Dutch Red Rises One and a Half Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market was unusually quiet in terms of futures trading due to certain issues. However, the trend was still stable, with little fluctuation. Company futures trading for 24 coarse white due at the end of this month had no market. September 10 trading was at 126.6 yuan, 128.2 yuan, and 127 yuan. Afternoon trading was at 126.6 yuan, 127 yuan, and .6 yuan. September 20 trading was at 130.8 yuan, 131.2 yuan, and 129.3 yuan. Afternoon trading was from 129 yuan to 128.9 yuan.

Spot Dutch Red KD mark was 120.5 yuan, up 1.5 yuan. Taikoo Granulated White B mark was still 161 yuan, HX mark was 135.5 yuan to 136 yuan, up 2.5 yuan. Altogether, over 160,000 bags of futures and over 4,000 bags of spot were traded.

### Dried Goods: Very Little Wood Ear Offered

Due to the small inventory of black wood ear, there was little observation and few offers. Those with firm intentions did not quote prices. Therefore, the recent market opening price increased again. Dozens of bags of He Kou wood ear were offered, with good slices and acceptable body and color, opening at 1050 yuan, up 20 yuan.

### Fourteen Foreign Banks Halt Black Market Exchange Transactions Yesterday; Awaiting Hong Kong Meeting to Decide on Measures; Management of Imported Goods Extremely Strict

The Shanghai method for settling foreign exchange for essential imports has been discussed multiple times by Dr. Taylor and the Chinese and foreign banking communities in this port, and basic principles have been drafted. These will be submitted to the second plenary meeting of the Equalization Fund Committee, which is about to be held in Hong Kong, for discussion and approval. Chinese and foreign import traders in this port are paying close attention to the implementation of foreign exchange control in Shanghai in the future. Even more interest has been aroused by the fact that Taylor, as well as Mr. Mackay, General Manager of Citibank, and Mr. Hawkins, General Manager of Mercantile Bank, have been summoned to Hong Kong to participate in the equalization meeting. According to the observation of most merchants, this equalization meeting held in Hong Kong will not only negotiate the most concrete and effective measures to maintain the supply of foreign exchange for essential imports, but will also take appropriate steps to prevent black market activities. Judging from the fact that the managers of Mercantile Bank and Citibank are going to Hong Kong, it is believed that any plan determined by this meeting will be unanimously supported by Chinese and foreign banks. Yesterday, the fourteen Allied banks in this city that hold special notes from the US government to operate foreign exchange business all suddenly stopped listing US exchange rates, and the American Chase Bank further withdrew from black market transactions. The biggest reason is that the heads of Mercantile Bank and Citibank are going to Hong Kong, and there are many risks in the future of foreign exchange, so they are unwilling to supply it.

The English "Great American Evening Post" reported that the supply of foreign exchange stopped yesterday morning. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai branch of Chase Bank exited the black market foreign exchange business. Although the other thirteen banks controlled by the Equalization Fund Committee did not withdraw from the black market, they all stopped announcing US exchange selling prices, and waited for the command from Hong Kong to act. The reason for this move was not known yesterday morning. However, Chase Bank still absorbed US exchange at a price of 5.4375 yuan, until further notice. Foreign exchange will still be supplied for imports approved by the Equalization Fund Committee. It is also understood that the foreign exchange market was quiet yesterday morning. HSBC's listing price remained unchanged, and black market transactions were quiet. The reason is that the managers of Mercantile Bank and Citibank went to Hong Kong to participate in the equalization meeting, and foreign banks were unwilling to supply foreign exchange in order to avoid risks, so transactions were scarce. The banks' morning opening selling prices were 2 pence and 875 for British exchange and 4 yuan and 875 for US exchange, compared to the previous day, British exchange was flat and US exchange increased by .03125. There were no transactions after the opening. The afternoon closing was the same as the morning opening.

Foreign exchange for rice imports is approved for settlement. According to news from the banking community yesterday, since the Equalization Fund Committee decided to supply foreign exchange for essential goods at new prices by designated banks starting on August 18, some foreign firms engaged in rice imports have already applied to the banks for foreign exchange settlement. After review, it was determined that the rice to be imported by these firms was in compliance with the regulations, and the Equalization Fund Committee has notified the original handling banks to settle the exchange according to the amount applied for. As for coal, although there are those who have applied for foreign exchange settlement, because the source of coal is not from the British pound or US dollar groups, the Equalization Fund still needs to consider whether to approve it or not, which is still unknown.

Foreign firms' cargo transportation is also restricted. It is learned that the Equalization Fund has decided on steps to control import trade: (1) Foreign exchange will be refused for goods that are not approved for import, and even for those that are approved for import, restrictions will be imposed; (2) If British and American exporters want to transport non-urgent goods to China, they are requested to restrict them when examining them. It is said that the United Kingdom supports this move. The British Ministry of Commerce recently issued an order to prohibit all exports to China, except those through Burma, in order to consolidate China's Equalization Fund.

Those who defend China and seek victory. The author visited several people in the financial community yesterday to inquire about their opinions. They all hoped that a method that would adapt to the Shanghai environment could be formulated at the Equalization Meeting. There were no other comments. However, the "Millard's Review," published today, contained an article by foreign economic expert Mr. Ahlers, discussing the issue of stabilizing China's legal tender. In the conclusion, he believed that the Equalization Fund must be specifically tailored to the needs of Shanghai in order to determine China's monetary policy. This view is different. The article stated: "For the sake of normal commerce and the general public in Shanghai, the stability of the legal tender is undoubtedly absolutely necessary. However, the Chinese government and the British and American countries may not be able to determine China's monetary policy solely to meet the needs of Shanghai. China has now obtained equalization loans from Britain and the United States, and the Equalization Committee has also been established. Its initial task is to assist free China in defeating Japan, defending free China, and achieving victory. This is the main issue, and everything else is secondary."

### An Italian Light Cruiser Suddenly Came to Shanghai from Kobe; A Jiangsu Export Vessel Once Turned Back Because of This; After the Company's Explanation, It Resumed Its Southward Voyage; British and American Consulates Paid Close Attention to the Ship's Arrival in Shanghai

Since the expansion of the European War, Italian warships stationed in the Far East have returned to their countries to serve. Those that could not depart had to sail to Japan to dock. However, Shanghai still had two shallow-water gunboats, the E. Carlotto and the Lepanto, moored at buoys No. 1 and 2 outside the Waibaidu Bridge.

Yesterday morning, the light cruiser Eritrea suddenly came to Shanghai from Kobe, entering the port around 9 a.m. and docking at buoy No. 21. When the ship entered the port, the Taikoo Company's Jiangsu vessel was just leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong. When the Jiangsu vessel reached the Yangshupu River, the shipowner suddenly saw the Italian ship. Because all destroyers and cruisers other than the two Italian shallow-water gunboats had been withdrawn from the Far East after the expansion of the European War, upon seeing the ship, he thought an accident had occurred and was afraid of an unexpected event. Therefore, he dared not approach the ship and immediately turned back to Shanghai to ask the company for instructions. After learning that there was no problem, the ship was ordered to set sail again around 3 p.m. yesterday and left Wusong at 6:15 p.m., sailing south safely. The British and American consulates paid very close attention to the Italian ship's sudden arrival this time.

### Japanese Taxpayers Owe Nearly 600,000 in Taxes

According to the Japanese newspaper "Mainland News," the Concession Problem Discussion Group, reorganized by Japanese taxpayers, held its second meeting at the Japanese Club on the afternoon of the 28th. All Japanese employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council and two Japanese consuls also participated. Chairman Ganno reported that, according to a survey by the tax collection section of the Municipal Council's Finance Department, as of July 15, 1941, the large amount of uncollected taxes owed by foreign nationals totaled 1,321,520 yuan, of which Japanese residents accounted for 589,317 yuan, accounting for 44.59% of the total. The reasons for the delay in payment were the changes in the situation in the concession after the incident, coupled with various obstacles in the implementation of administration and police power by the Municipal Council. However, the Japanese taxpayers should reflect on and be aware of their position and responsibility in the concession administration, and should strive to fulfill their obligations. Subsequently, a resolution was made based on this purpose, stating that the number of Japanese people who delayed paying taxes was quite large, which gave other taxpayers a handle.

### British Public Buses Scheduled to Resume Operation This Morning; The Labor Side Notified All Workers Yesterday to Enter the Factory Uniformly at 6 a.m. This Morning

The labor dispute over the public bus strike in the Public Concession, which had been delayed for five days, had been negotiated several times by labor and management, and a solution was reached yesterday afternoon. Vehicles on all routes were scheduled to resume operation uniformly starting this morning. The terms of resumption of work agreed upon yesterday afternoon are as follows:

Agreed Terms

(1) Starting from September 1, workers' allowances will be increased by 20%. For the sake of a permanent solution, commodity allowances will be granted separately in the future according to the cost of living index published by the Municipal Council. Detailed measures will be determined separately. (2) According to the report of the traffic supervisor, the driving time of vehicles will be adjusted to reduce workers' work and time. (3) The company agreed to consider improving the personnel management issue after investigation. (4) Half of the wages and allowances will be paid during the strike period (it was stated at the time that if work was resumed this morning, it would not be given). (5) The wages of coppersmith No. 1108 who was sentenced by the court for official reasons will be paid as usual, and the company agreed to consider it, but the five dismissed workers will not be allowed to return to work. (6) The company does not allow the transfer of workers' positions. (7) There are still two worker representatives (the labor side originally requested to increase to six). The company agrees to respect the status of the representatives.

Resuming the operation of vehicles. After the workers of the public bus company went on strike on the morning of the 25th, they were persuaded to resume work first and then conduct sincere negotiations after adjusting two conditions. Later, the resumption of work failed due to temporary twists and turns. After discussing the matter at a meeting, the workers believed that the principles of acceptable conditions were not thoroughly resolved, and in order to solve the problem once and for all, they decided to send representatives Zhang Aqing and others, 15 people, to negotiate directly with the company. After continuous consultations in the past two days, the labor and management sides reached an agreement, which was announced to be resolved. The labor side notified all traffic and mechanical workers last night to enter the factory uniformly at 6 a.m. this morning to resume work.

### Martial Law Suddenly Imposed in Nanshi Last Night

Around 6:30 p.m. yesterday, the Japanese army in the Nanshi area suddenly announced temporary martial law again. The Japanese troops stationed in Nanshi were dispatched to inspect and patrol various roads. It was heard that the iron gates of the French Concession bordering Nanshi were also announced to be closed, cutting off traffic. The reason for the sudden alert is unknown. The Governor-General of Annam announced Shanghai as a port of cholera transmission. If travelers going to Vietnam do not have an epidemic prevention certificate that is more than six days and less than six months old, their passports will not be visaed.

### Moonlight Theater Tonight: Victory Night; Responding to the V Movement

The moonlight theater event hosted by the British Embassy Information Office has been held for almost a month, and the results have been very satisfactory. It is learned that the association has added a special "Victory Night" (ie V-word night) program, and the date has been set for tonight, to be held at the original location. It is expected that the people of the Allied countries will all attend the meeting at that time to celebrate the arrival of victory. Each person attending the meeting will be given a V-word marked paper by the association to paste on the front of the car to show their wish for victory and respond to Churchill's V-word movement.

### American Transport Ship Did Not Enter the Port

The American transport ship Henderson was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but it had not been seen entering the port by night. It is likely that the sea conditions were bad, so the sailing was slow and it may arrive in port today or tomorrow.

### This City's Export Trade Will Become Active Recently; The Exchange Stabilization Fund's Current Task Is Extremely Important; The US Freezing Order Is Greatly Beneficial to Silk Merchants

The English Financial and Commercial Weekly stated that it is worth mentioning that the current export trade has not disappeared, nor is it showing signs of gradually disappearing. If transportation is unimpeded and there are no continued political disturbances, then export trade may possibly pick up in the near future. With the increase in export orders and the decrease in merchants' demands on the market,

there is hope for improvement in the black market exchange rate, and the gap between the legal and black market exchange rates will gradually close and eventually disappear. Within Free China, there are large amounts of credit loans to purchase necessary raw materials, and export trade is used to offset credit loans. In essence, it is based on exchange, so Free China can be left to its own devices without the need for outside intervention. However, the Exchange Stabilization Fund should closely monitor the current currency situation within the occupied areas, as this is currently

the only issue. If the Exchange Stabilization Fund cannot satisfactorily resolve this issue, it will inevitably fail in its mission, and the funds entrusted to the fund will be thrown into a bottomless pit. Furthermore, according to another report in the newspaper, since the Incident, a large quantity of raw silk from this city and the interior has been detained by Japanese companies. Since the US Treasury Department issued the freezing order, the Japanese authorities in this city have immediately engaged in

negotiations with local silk exporters to release the raw silk. Under the Japanese policy of controlling silk cocoons in Central China, the export business has long been suppressed, but now it is suddenly becoming active. In the first three weeks of this month, no less than five thousand bales of silk were imported into the United States, all of which were exported privately by foreign firms.

Third Batch of Japanese Nationals

Evacuated from the Philippines to Shanghai

President Cleveland Arrives in Shanghai Tonight

Departure of the General Pershing Delayed

The world-class liner President Cleveland of the American President Lines, arriving from Los Angeles on its maiden voyage eastward, via Honolulu directly to Shanghai (not stopping in Japan), is scheduled to arrive at 7:00 PM this evening, mooring at buoy number 4.45. Passengers will transfer to the company's prepared small boats to

disembark at the New Customs Wharf at 8:00 PM tonight. The liner will remain in Shanghai for 18 hours, scheduled to depart at midnight on the 31st, bound for various ports in Southeast Asia, via the Cape of Good Hope, returning to the United States. The third batch of Japanese nationals evacuated from Manila, Philippines, numbering 227 people, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the French postal steamer D'Artagnan, mooring at buoys 11 and 12. The Japanese nationals transferred to small boats to

disembark at Hongkou. In addition to the Japanese nationals, there were ten other people on board who disembarked at the New Customs Wharf via small boats. Furthermore, the French postal steamer General Pershing, which arrived on the 22nd of this month, carrying the second batch of Japanese nationals evacuated from Southeast Asia, as reported in previous issues, weighed anchor at 3:20 PM yesterday and returned to Saigon along its original route. Unexpectedly, after sailing to the Yangshupu section of the river,

it suffered mechanical damage and returned to buoys 13 and 14 for repairs. After completion, it again cast off at approximately 5:00 PM and departed southward at approximately 7:00 PM.

Ta Shun Kang

Direct to Zhanjiang

Does Not Call at Hong Kong En Route

Anchors Aweigh on September 1st

In the past, traveling to and from the southwestern areas of Free China was very inconvenient.

Mainland Newspaper Labor Dispute Resolved

Publishing as Usual Today

The workers of the English-language Mainland Newspaper requested improved treatment, and the management agreed to consider it. However, the workers must dismiss five workers, which formed a stalemate. After mediation the night before last, work was resumed first. The treatment issues will be discussed again on September 1st. The workers considered this satisfactory. The twenty or so workers present at the time resumed work first. Due to manpower issues, only one large sheet was published yesterday. Yesterday evening, more than eighty workers returned to work at the newspaper and publishing resumed as usual.

Procedures for Reporting Export of Local and Foreign Goods

For Shipments Not Via Inland Waterways, Certificates Are Issued in Nanshi. The General Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs has repeatedly stipulated the procedures for re-exporting local or foreign goods that have been transported to Shanghai and that the holders intend to re-export to various places in the interior. The following is an exploration of the methods for reporting the re-export of local and foreign goods: (1) Local goods: For all local goods reported for transport to various places in the interior, a re-export declaration form (D-5, two copies, original and duplicate; no statistical sub-report form is required) should be filled out, along with the passport. The form should be submitted to the declaration numbering counter of the Export Department of this Customs. After the Customs has stamped the duplicate declaration with the Customs Seal of the Commissioner of Customs, the waiting room will issue it to the reporter as a release permit to allow for inspection and release. (2) Foreign goods: For those reporting the transport of foreign goods to various places in the interior, a foreign goods tax payment certificate should be filled out and submitted along with the passport to the declaration numbering counter of the Export Department of this Customs. After the Customs has stamped the tax payment certificate with the Customs Seal of the Commissioner of Customs, it should be returned to the reporter as usual by the waiting room to allow for inspection and release. Furthermore, for merchants reporting the re-export of local or foreign goods to various places in the interior, except for foreign goods that must be inspected and must have a transport license, other goods not transported by inland waterway vessels must, as usual, apply for a tax payment certificate at the Customs Nanshi office to allow for inspection and release.

The Dog Days of Summer Are Over

It has now been decided that beginning in September, regular meetings will be held weekly as before. It is understood that the first meeting is scheduled for the first week of next month.

### Industrial and Commercial Employees Met with Tan at the Newspaper Office Last Night; The Second Vocational School Has a Special Commercial Class; Wuxi National College Donates Free Spots for Junior High School

The industrial and commercial employee group of this newspaper's reader scholarship fund started interviews yesterday. From 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM, over forty applicants arrived at the newspaper office on time for interviews. Most of them had a proper attitude, sincere speech, and an eagerness to learn, which溢于言表, truly a new atmosphere in the industrial and commercial sector. Applicants continued to arrive yesterday. However, a small number of clerks did not have the seal of their manager or director, which could not be accommodated according to the rules. The original intention of this newspaper is that clerks pursuing continuing education in their spare time must obtain the permission or recommendation of their employer to be qualified.

Special Commercial Knowledge Class. The Second China Vocational Supplementary School at the intersection of Beijing Road and Henan Road sent a letter stating that, in addition to donating额十各, it will also open a practical commercial knowledge class with the goal of cultivating excellent service ethics and skills. The entrance exam is scheduled for September 9th, and registration begins immediately. Anyone who has graduated from junior high school or has equivalent qualifications can enroll. Enrollment is limited to thirty students. Graduation takes two semesters. The curriculum includes commercial applied writing, commercial English conversation, commercial bookkeeping, abacus, sales, and clerk service knowledge.

The Mushi Supplementary School Focuses on Academic Ability. Xu Mushi, the principal of the Mushi English Supplementary School in the Pudong Building, has offered twenty free spots to support poor vocational youth. This has been reported in this newspaper, and inquiries about enrollment procedures have been endless. However, the curriculum of the school is suitable for high school and junior high school levels. If any employees apply for free admission, they must first pass the review of this newspaper and then submit a letter of recommendation before they can proceed.

Wuxi National College Offers Free Spots. Mr. Tang Wenzhi, the principal of Wuxi National College of Sinology, wrote, "Your newspaper has established a reader scholarship fund, which greatly benefits the poor and humble. Now, I hear that it has ended, but there are still many who continue to request assistance. Our school has a free junior high school class run by 高价人君, which enrolls first-year junior high school freshmen in the autumn. We are currently enrolling students. If there are those who request assistance from your newspaper, please recommend them to our school immediately. However, they must still pass the exam. We respectfully ask for your attention." The sincerity of the school is very commendable. If any readers wish to enter this junior high school, please send a letter of application within five days so that they can be compiled and recommended. Applications after the deadline will not be considered.

Approved List to be Published Daily. This newspaper, in view of the fact that various supplementary schools will be opening one after another and to take into account the early enrollment of various employees, is expediting the procedures as much as possible. The first batch of approved names will be published on September 1st. Afterwards, they will be announced successively on a daily basis, and the application deadline is set for five days and will not be extended. Therefore, those who wish to enroll early must apply as soon as possible.

### A Conversation with a Deaf-Mute Person - One of the Interviews for the Industrial and Commercial Scholarship

— Jiang Ping

In the first day's application forms for the Industrial and Commercial Scholarship, I found a teacher from the affiliated elementary school of the China Association for the Deaf and Mute. His surname is Song. Under the "Previous Education" section, he filled in that he had graduated from the specialized class of the Private Shanghai School for the Deaf and Mute. That's when I realized that he was also a deaf-mute person. The writing on his application form was very neat and beautiful. He wanted to study in the painting department of the Xinhua Art College, because art is the most suitable subject for deaf-mute people. At around 7:00 PM last night, he came to the newspaper office for an interview. Because we couldn't express our meaning through language, we had to use writing instead. The following is the record of this written conversation.

"After becoming deaf-mute, how do you understand the meaning of reading?" This was the first question I asked him.

"I'm ashamed to say that I hadn't finished the first year of junior elementary school when I became deaf. Afterwards, I have been self-studying to reach my current level."

"I'm very surprised by your intelligence. How do you understand the meaning of each character and be able to apply it?"

"I suffered from meningitis in my childhood, which caused deafness, but my vocal cords are not completely broken. At that time, I used the two or three hundred characters I had read as a foundation, and I would trouble others and look up dictionaries for what I didn't understand; however, this way of reading is very uneconomical."

"Is it difficult for a deaf-mute person to study art with people who can speak and hear?"

"Very little. Two or three of my students will graduate from Xinhua Art College this year." He seemed to have great confidence. After pausing, he wrote again, "Until now, this is still my only hope; because I am poor." What he meant was: Until now, I have held the only wish of entering art college. Because I am poor, I cannot afford to go to school. When he was writing, I saw that his mood was very excited, and his ability to write quickly surpassed mine.

"Is your family in Shanghai? What does your father do?"

"My father is in Shanghai, working as a teacher, and his income is not enough to eat; my mother and sisters are all in my hometown." When he wrote "income is not enough to eat," his facial expression showed great distress. "Can I have hope?" He obviously had eager expectations for this scholarship application in order to realize his long-cherished wish and achieve his goal.

"We certainly sympathize with you."

"If I have hope, then I can register; the reason I have hesitated to register in advance is because the registration fee is five yuan." He attached great importance to the five-dollar registration fee, in case he was not approved.

"Our principle is that the scholarship is for industrial and commercial employees, and school employees are not within the scope. However, I personally think that your situation is special, and perhaps we can think of other ways. I think you might as well register first." I could only comfort him in this way.

"If my long-cherished aspirations can be realized, then I will never forget this kindness. I also know that my application does not conform to the rules of your newspaper, but because I think that my income is less than that of industrial and commercial employees, and the length of time I have been out of school exceeds anyone else, perhaps your newspaper, with the aim of helping the public, can make a special accommodation." He excitedly picked up his pen and wrote quickly to express his expectations and aspirations.

"The approved list will be published in the newspaper and will not be notified separately, so please pay attention."

The written conversation could have ended here, but then I remembered that Lin Jim, the protagonist of "Dumb Lovers," had also applied, so I asked him about Lin Jim.

"Are you familiar with him?"

"We are colleagues."

"He also applied to learn Chinese typing."

"However, he cannot hear or speak, and his intelligence is not high. Please forgive him when you ask him about it."

"He is the protagonist of Dumb Lovers. The couple had a falling out once. How are they now?"

"After mediation, they reconciled, but their feelings have plummeted."

"Are you married?" I knew that he was only twenty years old, so he probably wasn't married, but I asked as a joke.

"A poor boy dare not think of it." He smiled at me and got up to say goodbye.

### Son of Hong Fa Arrested by the Japanese; Another Three Arrests Were Unsuccessful

The Japanese recently dispatched personnel to cooperate with detectives from the French Concession Police to arrest three Chinese youths in front of the Nanjing Grand Theater and at No. 113 Jufu Road. The details have already been reported. Now, according to news received yesterday, at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Japanese dispatched plainclothes teams to drive to the French Concession Police Station and requested detectives to accompany them to No. 65 Lafayette Road to arrest two Chinese people. It is said that one of the two was Xu Lisheng, the son of Xu Hongfa, who is currently a military officer in Pudong, and the other was his friend, both in their thirties. According to confessions, at 10:00 PM that night, the Japanese dispatched personnel to cooperate with detectives from the French Concession Police to Room 407 of the Dahulu Hotel on Edward Road, Dongxinqiao, to arrest Chinese people, but were unsuccessful. Between 8:00 and 9:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese escorted Xu Lisheng to No. 36 Wanyi Lane, Luban Road, and No. 113 Jufu Road to arrest people, but were unsuccessful.

Attempting to Arrest Hong Fa. According to Pingmingshe, the purpose of the Japanese search was actually to arrest Xu Hongfa. Xu happened to be out at the time, and only his son Lisheng and a friend were inside talking, so they were arrested. It is reported that Xu Hongfa is from Pudong and used to be a mason. He committed a crime before the war and was sentenced to imprisonment. He was released from prison after the war and immediately gathered idlers in Pudong, calling himself the commander of the army, robbing and plundering, and doing whatever he wanted. The residents hated him to the bone.

Assassinated Japanese Soldiers and Soon Joined the Japanese Side, His Arrogance Increased. Later, because his subordinates assassinated a Japanese soldier, he was afraid of being arrested by the Japanese and fled in fear of disaster. The Japanese issued an arrest warrant, but he was never caught. Recently, it was discovered that Xu was hiding in the Dahulu Hotel, so the Japanese immediately cooperated with the French Concession Police to go to arrest him, but he still managed to escape.

### Autumn Rains, Cooling Weather

Since entering autumn, this city has received abundant rainfall. It has only recently cleared up. Starting the night before last, there was another heavy rain that drizzled all night. Yesterday morning, the rain became even heavier, and the weather was very cool, creating the phenomenon of one rain making it autumn. Furthermore, the tidal surge in the Huangpu River, which had already subsided, caused the roads to flood again between 3:00 and 4:00 PM due to the heavy rain.

### Japanese National Claims to Have Been Robbed; Police Investigation Finds Nothing

At 4:04 PM yesterday, a Japanese man was walking through the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road when he was suddenly stopped by a robber who pointed a gun and threatened him. The robber took all 5,280 yuan in French currency that the Japanese man was carrying and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the Japanese man reported to the police station and requested an investigation. According to the results of the investigation by the assigned detectives, no robbery of a Japanese person occurred at that time.

At approximately 4:00 PM yesterday, four robbers broke into No. 15, Lane 462, Edward Road, and threatened the occupants with guns. They robbed over ten bolts of silk fabric, worth over 2,000 yuan in French currency, and fled out the door with the loot.

### Textbooks from San Tong Bookstore Robbed in Hongkou

According to news from the San Tong Bookstore branch at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Shanxi Road, at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday (the 27th), three employees were sent to escort 25,000 textbooks to Hongkou. They were loaded onto the company's truck. Unexpectedly, at the intersection of Tangshan Road and Zhoushan Road, several men resembling coolies blocked the way, dragged the three employees out and beat them, and robbed over 400 textbooks before fleeing without a trace. After the Japanese learned of this, they immediately dispatched military police to rush to the scene to search for the perpetrators and search the surrounding area. It is said that one suspect was apprehended as a result.

### Judge of the First Court Did Not Broadcast

Recently, reports stated that a certain judge from the Shanghai First Special District Court gave a radio broadcast on rental disputes. This reporter recently inquired with an official of the Shanghai First Special District Court to find out what happened. According to the official, the judges of this court are busy with cases all day long and have no time to go out and broadcast. Moreover, court staff are prohibited from unauthorized public statements, as ordered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The colleagues of this court have always adhered to this rule without change. Furthermore, after investigation, the so-called "certain judge" is unknown to us. His name is not on the attendance book or the salary book of the staff of this court. It must be a rumor and misunderstanding.

### Cultivation Lecture Hygiene and Cultivation Method (Part 2) (Written for Middle and High School Students)

— Song Guobin

2. Prevention of Sexual Disease and Neurasthenia. Among middle and high school students, these are the most prevalent. Because middle and high schools have heavy workloads, students, driven by vanity, often overwork their brains. The nervous system often exhibits a state of hyperemia. The sexual center is stimulated by this, causing sexual impulses. As a result, some indulge in dissolute behavior, frequenting brothels and dance halls, thinking it is a way to relieve boredom. Those who are cautious watch sensual movies and read obscene novels, forming habits of self-gratification. The only way to remedy this is to follow studying with exercise. In this way, on the one hand, the hyperemia of the brain is distributed to the limbs, and the urge for lust is naturally reduced. On the other hand, the exhausted spirit can be revitalized, and the depressed mood is imperceptibly dissipated. Without the need for restraint, the effect of reducing desires is naturally achieved. Moreover, exercise not only prevents sexual diseases and regulates the brain, but also strengthens muscles, adjusts the function of internal organs, and increases general resistance. Therefore, the importance of having a sports field in a school is no less than that of various laboratories. 3. Vaccination. The strenuous exercise discussed above can only increase the body's general resistance, but it is still useless for special infectious diseases. It is like a country: while it is important to have a wealthy economy and strong national defense, special equipment for national defense is also essential. Otherwise, if planes come and you have no anti-aircraft guns, if poison gas comes and you have no gas masks, won't there be the same tragic consequences of national subjugation and extermination? Hygiene is also like this. On the one hand, it is necessary to have general resistance, and on the other hand, it is even more necessary to have special resistance to prepare for different attacks by various germs. This is what is called vaccination immunity. The meaning of vaccination is to inject weakened germs into the body, allowing the body to practice resistance and develop antitoxins. This is preventive medicine, using vaccination methods to increase the body's special resistance. Because people's bodies, although , cannot be said to be immune to any infectious disease. With vaccination, it is truly free from infection. There are now many diseases that can be prevented by vaccination, such as smallpox, cholera, typhoid, dysentery, diphtheria, meningitis, tetanus, etc. If vaccinated every year or every years, these diseases can generally be avoided.

In short, past hygiene methods were biased towards protection, aiming to keep people away from contact with the environment in order to avoid disease. This is so-called passive hygiene. What is needed today is training-oriented, automatically contacting the bad environment in order to practice resistance. Even if exposed to pathogens, one will not get sick. This is active hygiene and true hygiene.

### Self-Respect and Self-Love

— Jiang Hong

In the morning, passing by the entrance of a desolate fabric store, you can often see dozens of idle clerks sitting idly at the counters, silently letting the ruthless passage of time flow by. Seeing this scene, one cannot help but sigh at the worthlessness of time for some people. I often find it strange why they don't use this time to read some books, newspapers, and magazines. The first answer, of course, is that the manager doesn't allow it. Flipping through books and newspapers during office hours would be inappropriate, right?

Some store clerks not only cannot use their spare time during office hours to read books and newspapers, but even their leisure time is not free for reading. This situation is particularly common in old-fashioned stores. Some bosses, because they themselves have had little education, have surprisingly had a day of rapid advancement. As a result, they have adopted the prejudice that "reading is useless," considering it a superfluous matter. Other store authorities believe that clerks reading books impairs their efficiency and spirit in handling matters. This may be a fact for clerks who do not know how to cherish themselves, but it is not an absolute truth.

However, from this, we can learn a lesson. Self-study and reading in one's spare time are certainly rights that clerks should have, but clerks must also be able to respect and cherish themselves in order not to lose the rights they have already obtained. Clerks who can read books and newspapers in their spare time during office hours should deeply rejoice and uphold the principle of not neglecting their duties and not defaulting on their responsibilities to show that they are qualified to enjoy this privilege. Even self-study in one's spare time should be based on the principle of not hindering proper affairs. This is not only for the sake of one's own future but also for the sake of safeguarding the reasonable rights of all clerks. Clerks should pay attention to this vital issue.

War

### Radio War

— Yu

Twenty-four hours a day, Britain and use forty-three languages, from one hundred radio stations to broadcast non-stop to all parts of the world. Some reports are scolding, and some are very friendly and gentle.

Germany has fifty radio stations, specializing in attacking Britain. Almost every sentence is laced with ridicule and hatred. Eden is referred to as a skilled tailor, Economic Warfare Minister Linot is called the "Minister of Hunger," and, of course, the Prime Minister is the "Chief of War."

A sinister voice that can be heard from the radio from time to time is Berlin reporter Feliz Che. He often says: "British people, please ask Churchill how the Wood ship of war is now." He further insisted that the Royal Ark had also been sunk by Germany. Not long ago, Feliz Che announced that the Vernon had been hit by a German submarine. But this retired warship had already been towed to the shore of Portsmouth.

Sometimes, when a British radio station is broadcasting, Germany will use a loud voice to interfere: "Today we are talking about the German enemy Churchill. How did he organize the cabinet? In the past, didn't many people hate him? But after the outbreak of the European war, the hatred disappeared invisibly. This is all thanks to the Jews in China, who are trying to manipulate the British cabinet."

An Egyptian named Fugaose was captured by . He was asked whether he would rather broadcast or be detained in a prisoner-of-war camp. As a result, he chose the broadcasting job, and every day he promoted the bad things about Britain. Several captured Royal Air Force personnel also went on the radio to tell their families that it was more comfortable here than in a first-class hotel. However, whether they are indeed British is a question, because had a British soldier asked for leave to return home to visit his family and happened to hear the German radio station promote that he had been captured and invite "him" to the stage to talk to his family. He and his family laughed it off, and from then on, the Nazi trickery was exposed.

As for the German people, they are not allowed to listen to foreign broadcasts. If they are found secretly listening, they will be sentenced to several years of hard labor, or even death. So they talk to each other like this: "What did you "dream" last night?" "I dreamed that the Royal Ark was not sunk." "Strange, I had the same dream."

When Britain broadcasts to Germany, it often ridicules the Nazis for strictly forbidding the people to listen to foreign radio stations. "Himmerle tells you not to listen to British broadcasts because he is guilty. German people, this is your freedom. We British can listen to Nazi news at will, even the Scottish field police stand outside the window and listen quietly."

What the people of are most welcome is the British broadcast of the names of German prisoners of war. A woman in East Prussia learned from the official gazette that her son had drowned in a submarine accident, but just as she was preparing to commemorate him, five friends secretly told her at the same time that according to the British report on the names of prisoners, her son was also one of them. So the memorial service was still held, and she and her friends drank a toast to celebrate.

London reporters, seeing the German government's food restrictions, deliberately taught British women how to cook. They shouted loudly on the radio: "Four eggs, a quarter of a pound of butter, two spoons of sugar." The face of the colored German people, really have a feeling of wanting to salivate.

Sketches

### Summer Night

— Lan Wen

People tell me that summer nights are beautiful and lovely. So I began to set foot in the shadows of the night.

I walked through quiet streets and alleys, I walked through bustling roads: I saw the quietly standing plane trees, they sighed softly; I saw the women covered in makeup silently leaning under the street lights, they forced themselves to smile - there were shadows of tears in their smiles, bitter memories.

I walked in the dark shadows of the night, I had a yearning, I had an expectation, I was looking for the beauty and loveliness of summer nights.

I don't know when I started hearing the sound of crying. I myself have long lost the habit of crying. Although tears may well up in my eyes when emotions are aroused, this is different from crying. So I have always been puzzled by the crying of adults.

Following the sound, I walked over. (Guangsheng, I have lost my way, who can find beauty and loveliness in crying?) With the help of the dim street lights, I vaguely recognized that the one crying was an old man. He was sitting on the stone steps, his head buried in his own arms, as if he had not seen someone standing in front of him.

His crying gradually became weaker, and there was a tendency to subside and pause: I stood, stood. Why? Who knows. People often forget to give themselves a satisfactory reason before doing things, willing to laugh at themselves in retrospect, pitying themselves.

I was thinking, does he need sympathy? I have plenty of sympathy to give. But how much is sympathy worth to him? And he has already stretched out his withered hand, his stomach is shriveled.

I left him behind and walked away.

Suddenly, I had a terrible thought: how many years ago would he have been meandering in the shadows of the night with a strange feeling? How did the cruel fist of time knock him down? Alas, old man teased by fate, are you crying about the path of poverty in front of you, or are you mourning the beautiful past?

The world has turned into a sea and mulberry fields before his eyes; he is struggling and floating in the torrent of time; in the very end, what this vast world leaves him is a cool and hard stone step.

I couldn't help but remember another old man. Poverty forced him to break a leg, poverty forced him to sleep on the bed with a broken leg, and poverty will force him to become dust and earth with a broken leg.

Is this the ending that our world has arranged for old people? If it is true, then I think the barbarous customs of the barbaric Eskimos are an unparalleled grace to the down-and-out old people in our civilized society.

Curiosities

### Talking Tombstone

— Si Zhong

Recently, the United States has invented a very funny thing, which is a talking tombstone. The function of that thing is very simple: when you are alive, make a speech and record it into a record, then that record can be installed on your future tombstone, and anyone who comes to sweep the tomb or pay homage to your grave, you can talk to them.

Probably only comedians like this thing. They can talk about how interesting it is in the underworld, welcome guests, or say that they cannot get up to return the salute, very sorry. But timid people will definitely not go to their graves.

Twelve Unexpected Storms

Before the person finished speaking, Mei Bao was already crying with tears all over her face.

"...Xiao Gouzi was also very anxious, so he sent someone into the city overnight to pick you up and take you back...." The person said eloquently.

Mei Bao cried so much that she couldn't speak.

"Miss Wu, don't cry! Hurry up and go upstairs to pack your things and go back earlier!" Chen Da also interjected from the side.

"That's right, this brother is right. It's useless to cry now." The person nodded repeatedly. "Girl, hurry back and tell the gentleman, follow me! If we walk faster, we'll be home by tomorrow morning."

"Okay, wait a moment." Mei Bao choked and told the person, then desperately ran back to the dormitory. Just as she was packing her small leather suitcase, a flash of inspiration suddenly struck, and she couldn't help but think of two suspicious points: first, he remembered very clearly that Xiao Gouzi was someone who liked gambling and smoking. This year, although there were gambling tables everywhere in Zhangshu Village, Xiao Gouzi usually did not go there. Why did he suddenly change yesterday? Second, although Xiao Gouzi seemed to have an maternal uncle, they never interacted, and his brother often came to his own house. Why didn't he send him?..."

Later, she felt that she couldn't decide, so she went to the dormitory supervisor's room to find Supervisor Wang.

Supervisor Wang really drank too much alcohol today. At this time, her cheeks were still red, showing that she was not yet fully conscious. She leaned back on her kang, listening to Mei Bao tell the story of the person who came just now and the doubts in her heart, but she didn't say a word for a long time. (198)

Inventions

### Portable Target Range

— Ke Zhong

Shooting practice for ordinary soldiers must be held in a large target range, which costs a lot of time and occupies a lot of space. Corporal Fedowen of the United States Marine Corps, in view of this, invented a type of aiming shooting practice target, which is light, flexible and convenient. The time for training soldiers to aim and shoot can be shortened by ten times compared to peacetime. Both time and space are extremely economical. At this time of tense world situation and active recruitment of soldiers in the United States, this kind of portable target range will definitely make a great contribution to the mass production of soldiers who are proficient in shooting.

### Luo Qiu's Sea Movie Viewing Notes

— Yong

Regarding the details of the recent sea conference held by US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, newspapers around the world have already disclosed the details. However, there are still things that are not in a hurry, and few people outside know about them. This matter was transmitted by the United Artists Film Company's representative in Britain, and is translated as follows:

According to the telegram obtained by the company: When Churchill accompanied Roosevelt on the Prince of Wales warship to discuss matters in the Atlantic Ocean, he also watched "Lady Hamilton" with the officers on the ship. The Prime Minister has watched this film for the fourth time. After the film was over, the Prime Minister expressed this opinion to the officers beside him: "I think this film will definitely be of great interest to you, because the plot performed in it can be said to be exactly the same as our current situation!" According to the story of this film, it focuses on the threats and difficulties faced by Britain during the Welles era under Bismarck. The Prime Minister's reason for saying this is of course to encourage his subordinates!

### Twenty Years of Teacher-Student Relationship Severed in a Day (Part 1)

— Shao Xian

Picking up from the previous article, the Master of the Heavens was subjected to a tirade of abuse and scolding by his "eldest disciple," Cheng Yuqing. At that time, Yaoqing's beloved daughter, "Old Tie" (Wang Tieying), happened to be out on business, so Cheng Yuqing got off easy, and no one gave him a couple of whacks on Yaoqing's behalf. However, Yaoqing also felt this, and couldn't help but cry out loud, and cried very sadly, and there was a big reason for this: Yaoqing's second younger brother, Fengqing, had two sons. The eldest son, Shaoqing (i.e., Wang Erpian), studied literature, and the younger son, Youqing, studied old male roles from a young age. But Youqing always felt a little out of place singing old male roles, so Fengqing thought it would be better to have him switch to female roles. So he told him to follow his uncle Yaoqing to learn Qingyi roles. At the same time, because Yaoqing had no children, he also adopted Youqing to Yaoqing. Because Youqing had a small voice, he achieved quite a bit after switching to female roles. In the midst of this process, Cheng Yuqing joined the Wang family's school, and I don't know what fate from hundreds of years ago it was, but Yaoqing and his wife both fell in love with Yuqing. Yaoqing not only taught Yuqing all the tricks he had up his sleeve, but didn't teach them to Youqing; even in terms of treatment, he treated Yuqing like his own son, while treating Youqing like an outsider. This aroused dissatisfaction among the Wang family clan. In particular, Yaoqing's beloved daughter, Old Tie, loved to stand up for her third brother (referring to Youqing) and vehemently attacked Yuqing, so Yuqing and Old Tie had deep disagreements. After Yuqing ran away from the school for the first time because of Hua Xiaofang, Old Tie once advised her father, meaning that someone like Yuqing, who is so ungrateful and unjust, should not be taken back. Unexpectedly, Yuqing later returned to the school and said a lot of sweet words in front of his teacher's wife. Yaoqing and his wife forgot their beloved daughter's advice and took Yuqing back. Who knew that "mountains and rivers are easy to change," "but nature is hard to alter." Later, Yuqing actually staged a "scandalous" incident with Ma Yanfen. After the Ma Yanfen affair ended, Cheng Yuqing got involved with Yan Huizhu after she went to Gu Maoxuan to study acting. At that time, Li Muliang, the Qin player of the Yan family's troupe, was deeply in love with Huizhu. When he saw "Cheng" Yaojin suddenly appear out of nowhere, how could he not be angry! In a fit of anger, he wrote an anonymous letter to Yaoqing, saying that Yaoqing "did not teach his disciples strictly" and "played with female apprentices," scolding the Master of the Heavens to the bone! Later, Yaoqing found out the truth after inquiring everywhere. Yuqing knew that he had to hide temporarily, so he ran away for the second time. At that time, Old Tie even asked Yaoqing, "If Yuqing comes back again, will you still want him?" Yaoqing replied, "No matter what, I will not take him back."

### Jin Suqin Instructs in Singing and Dancing

— Fuxing

"The Legend of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl" is a mythological play. Because many parts use singing and dancing and classical techniques, it refers to many aspects of Peking opera. Director Xu Qu specially invited Jin Suqin and Zhang Yipeng as consultants to make the actors' movements more beautiful.

On the first day, Zhang Yipeng came to instruct. Because Hu Dao and He Bin played the Demon King in the play, as well as many small movements of tigers, wolves, and other animals, Zhang Yipeng, a famous monkey king in the south, made several movements that were very vivid. The posture and movements of the Demon King, and the roles of each tiger, wolf, dog, etc., do not use words or sounds to express, but rely entirely on movements to make people understand what kind of action it is. This was all pointed out by Zhang Yipeng.

Jin Suqin has been away from the Shanghai theater scene for several years. Recently, she has become even more slender and beautiful. That day, she wore a light yellow cheongsam and, while explaining the plot, couldn't help but think of the reformed Peking opera she did with Ouyang Yuqian back then.

There are very few Peking opera foundations among drama actors, but many interludes in "The Legend of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl" are close to Peking opera style. As a result, Shen Min, who plays the goddess Lanlan and the Weaver Girl, felt it was difficult. After rehearsing I don’t know how many times, Jin Suqin personally read the lyrics and instructed them while singing and doing. Because the gestures and movements in Peking opera cannot be learned immediately in one or two hours, Jin Suqin used the method of teaching dance to teach them step by step, rehearsing from two o'clock until dark.

On the day of the dress rehearsal, Jin Suqin and her sister Jin Suwen came to see it very enthusiastically. Lanlan Shen Min and others studied it for several days, and their movements and so on were in line with the way she taught. Singing and dancing, completely in the "Jin style", both sisters felt satisfied. Before leaving, they were pulled by the three actresses who played the Snake Girl and asked her to teach them the movements of the snake demon. If you see the ridiculous and symbolic reality of the snake demon in "The Legend of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl", you must first think of the difficulty of the Jin sisters' teaching.

### Novel of Characters in the Pear Garden

— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrations by Zhang Yizhang

(35) Song Dezhu

Song Dezhu was also a student of the first class of the opera school. She specializes in martial female roles and is known for her vigor. After graduating, she intended to form her own troupe, so she also performed Qingyi and Huadan roles, but her skills were not deep enough and not worth taking. Moreover, she is inherently frivolous and stops at a shallow level in each play, not exploring it in depth. Mistakes often occur, but Dezhu does not care, and no one corrects her. Is it because of Zai Fu's kindness that she luckily got to this point? Her martial female roles are erratic and agile. The danger of her moves exceeds that of Yan Shishan, but her stability is inferior. Shishan is the nephew of Jiuzhenfeng, but he does not specialize in swift and fierce eagles, much like Zhu Guifang. Those who retain Yan Jiu's vague style are instead Dezhu. This is also a strange thing. When Dezhu was practicing martial arts in her childhood, she was severely beaten by her teacher. She lost her footing and injured her foot tendons. When she recovered, one foot was lame. Therefore, although her martial arts are very brave, her posture on the stage always sways and turns, and she cannot stand upright. Compared with Jiuzhenfeng's "strength" and "beauty", they are as different as heaven and earth.

### Lin Shusen's Farewell Commemoration

— Chun

Lin Shusen has been singing at the Grand Stage for nearly two years. Tan Fuying will soon come to Shanghai to perform on stage, and he will take the opportunity to rest. Overall, Lin Ling has been a pillar of the stage in that theater for a considerable time. He has starred in various new and old plays and has a considerable box office appeal. Moreover, he has always been in good shape, even better than the famous actors from the north. He is the only actor among today's actors who is respected in the role of Guan Yu, and has long been admired by music lovers, which need not be said. It is unexpected that recently, the entire "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "Losing the Empty City and Killing Ma Su" and other plays are also performed every Sunday and at night. I think that he may be relying on his seniority and loud voice, and wanting to show his talent of "being able to do everything" before daring to try? Therefore, I went to watch it. As for the plot, everyone knows it, so there is no need to elaborate. I feel that his "appearance", "gestures", "singing", and "expressions" have all reached a state of perfection, but if he is compared with the Xusheng who is good at singing this play, he seems to be slightly inferior. However, "Watching Paintings and Running to the City" and "From Xue Jiao Lifting the Stone Lion to Xu Ce Running to the Imperial City" have also been performed several times recently and are indeed his masterpieces, and other actors cannot hope to match him. However, these three plays are old plays with bones. Among the actors on various stages in Shanghai today, besides the rising star of Xusheng, Ji Yuliang, who can take on the first two plays, and Xiao Sanmazi, who can sing the last play, it is expected that no one else will perform them. Therefore, I believe that during this period, Shusen sang Xusheng plays in addition to Hong Wusheng (note: he originally sang Xusheng), which is also appropriate to adjust the audience's ears and eyes. Now that he will temporarily stop performing while waiting for Fuying to come to Shanghai, I hope that Lin Ling will have a humble heart and work harder, which is what the author hopes for.

### Miscellaneous Notes on Drama

— Xing

Wu Tianjin has completed a "Spring Love", which is a tragedy that happened in a small village in Jiangnan during the Northern Expedition and will be performed soon.

"The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" written by Chen Baichen was performed at the Carlton before the war and was quite a sensation at the time. The Shanghai Drama Art Society also plans to perform this play in the next issue.

Following "Grape Wine", Zhonglv is preparing to perform the four-act comedy "Under the Petticoat", starring Liu Lian, while Sun Jinglu is resting temporarily. During this rest period, she will rehearse "Green Blood and Yellow Sand", a play set in Mongolia. Director Wu Jingping has been studying the local costumes and customs for days.

It is said that Gao Zhanfei of the Central Photography Studio has arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing. Who is with him is difficult to find out. Is Gao Zhanfei going to stay in Hong Kong to make movies this time, or will he return to Shanghai via Hong Kong? It is still unknown for a while.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 15: Where Does a Powerful Family Forcibly Take Her Home?

Tian Hongyu only had this beloved daughter under his knees. He originally loved her like a pearl in his palm. What's more, his prominence was still due to his daughter's good fortune. After hearing his daughter speak so openly and honestly, and being loyal to the country, even though he loved Yuanyuan, how could he not agree? So he paused for a moment, and then said, "I can always agree with what you say. Now that you are willing to do this yourself, I am also willing to part with Yuanyuan and offer her to the emperor. I hope that the emperor will favor Yuanyuan and reduce his worries, and not disappoint your good intentions." Tian Fei's brows relaxed slightly after hearing that her father had already agreed. The father and daughter then decided that Tian Fei should first speak to the emperor when she had the chance. If she obtained the emperor's tacit approval, she would have someone notify her father so that Tian Hongyu could send Yuanyuan to the palace. They talked for another moment before Tian Hongyu reported that he was leaving the palace. Returning to his residence, he couldn't help but feel a little lost. But when he thought of his daughter's virtue, he must not forget the country for personal reasons and fail the current emperor. But everyone in the family did not know about this yet. They were wondering why the auspicious day had not been chosen yet, and Yuanyuan also did not understand that she would enter the palace. After a few days, Tian Fei sent a trusted eunuch to tell her father that she had spoken to the emperor when she had the chance. The emperor said that national affairs were urgent and he had no time for this, but he did not reject it either. He probably tacitly approved. She told her father to send Yuanyuan to the palace immediately. Tian Hongyu, upon receiving his daughter's notification, did not dare to delay and immediately went to Yuanyuan's dressing room to talk to her. Since arriving in Beijing, Yuanyuan had been worried and resentful all day long. Looking back at the horizon, she missed the poet who cherished jade and feared that she would never see him again in this life. Her life would be ruined by that old man. Her heart was filled with 120 points of unwillingness. Who knew her deep pain? Who would come to comfort her? Furthermore, Tian Hongyu was already choosing an auspicious day and time to formally accept her as a concubine. This was also the old man deliberately making it so grand. If it were someone else, he would defile her whenever he pleased. (155)
