### Hitler Concurrently Serves as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army; Issues a Letter to Soldiers Nationwide Saying That an Offensive Will Be Launched Next Spring

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd – It was officially announced here last night that the Führer and Supreme Commander of the German armed forces has concurrently assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, replacing former Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, Field Marshal von Brauchitsch.

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 21st – Führer Hitler issued a letter to all soldiers and members of the National Socialist Storm Troopers tonight. The letter stated: "Soldiers and Storm Troopers! This war is being fought for the freedom of our people and for the security of our future living conditions. Those who represent the interests of Jewish capitalism, every twenty or twenty-five years, under the guise of trivial pretexts, inflict war upon us. We must find a way to eliminate this scourge so that it never happens again. This war is being fought for this purpose. Fortunately, the war is nearing a decisive stage. Since Japan's participation in the war, Germany, Italy, and their allies have gained a new ally, which is very fortunate. Certain countries, using the same pretexts, even said that Japan must be destroyed, but the Japanese army, with lightning action, destroyed the US Pacific Fleet and the British army in Singapore and occupied the bases of Britain and the United States in the Far East, bringing the current war into a favorable stage. Our army is fighting on the Eastern Front, attacking the most dangerous enemy, and has also achieved indelible victories, rarely seen in world history. However, with the sudden arrival of the harsh winter, we must establish solid positions on the front lines to defend them and wait until next spring to make other plans. All the land occupied by our great sacrifices must be firmly defended and never easily abandoned. For this, I appeal to the soldiers on the Eastern Front. All German soldiers must work hard and strive as the German army did in Russia four winters ago, setting an example for all allied countries. Not only that, we should train new armies and manufacture new and sophisticated weapons, as we did last winter. As for the Western Front defenses, they have been strengthened from Kogenis Port in Norway in the north to the Spanish border in the south. However, this defense line has actually spread throughout the entire continent, even reaching North Africa. We must find a way to overcome all the difficulties we encounter, but this depends on vigorous action, not missing the time. We must carry out all preparations so that we can launch a major counteroffensive next spring until the enemies in Eastern Europe are completely eliminated. For this reason, we are now taking several military measures, but this work requires the army and the people in the rear to work together to make great efforts before it can be effective. Our country's main combat power depends on the army. Therefore, I have decided, in addition to being the Grand Marshal of the three services of the sea, land, and air, to also serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Soldiers, in the last World War, I participated as an ordinary soldier, fought in many battles, and was wounded six times. Once, I almost became blind. Therefore, I am also well aware of the difficulties you are encountering today. Moreover, after the end of the last World War, I never doubted that our country would be able to revive, and I still fought resolutely as an ordinary soldier. Finally, I was able to unite the German nation. The result of fifteen years of continuous efforts finally freed Germany from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles. In short, I am always thinking of you. My ambition and work are solely to serve the people and make our country the greatest nation, which you must know. You must also know that I want to destroy the enemy and achieve victory. From now on, I will do my best in all matters relating to commanding the military and looking forward to the overall situation. All that is expected of you is to faithfully obey orders and follow me in striving until Greater Germany and the German people are finally liberated. God will not fail to grant victory to the bravest."

Special Manuscript of This Newspaper

### Soviet Union and Christianity

To express the solemn attitude of the Soviet Union, Moscow's wireless propaganda cites how the communist system has changed, no longer "rejecting God," while the oppressive actions initiated by the fascist and National Socialist governments in 1930 continue unabated, citing facts from various places as evidence.

The head of the Soviet intelligence department seems to have a well-considered plan for this kind of propaganda. The tone of the propaganda changes at any time to suit the audience in different places. From the two false alarms to the actual outbreak of the war in 1939, many events have been forgotten by the world, but now they are being re-propagated on the radio. The reporters can use a suitable tone to convey their meaning to each type of audience.

For example, Moscow reminded the Austrians of their former monasteries, which were highly knowledgeable and materially rich, but are now either destroyed or closed. Most of the monks of the past, except for those who sought refuge in foreign countries, have been sent to concentration camps.

Italy has always regarded the secret struggle between the Pope and the government as a painful matter. However, the Moscow Radio Station never let go, constantly propagating the rebuke of Pope Pius XI. As soon as Moscow received the news, it broadcast it all, regardless of its truth or falsehood, and waited for Austria's response.

In this respect, the fascist Farinacci provided a lot of material. His anti-religious attitude can be seen in his anti-Catholic articles in the fascist party newspaper, which is a great asset for Russian propaganda. When Moscow Radio mentions his great works, it often causes countless Italian listeners to run around and tell each other, flipping through the original text to verify that what the radio station said is not false, and then they leave satisfied.

In Spain, the "fascist" revolution is calling for support in the name of Catholicism. However, Moscow found an excellent Spaniard who said on the radio that Catholicism and the church have not benefited in the slightest under the new regime.

This kind of propaganda has already penetrated Spain. The following incident can prove this point.

A Swiss person who is sympathetic to Russia, when discussing the Soviet Union's turn to Christianity, denies that it is an act of begging for mercy, and asks people to recall the important relationship of the Orthodox Church in the lives of Russians before the establishment of the Soviet Union.

They also said: "We must remember that the one million people who make up the Communist Party only account for a very small part of the entire Russian people. We should also think that many leaders who were formerly devoutly religious and believed in God have now publicly canceled their previous statements, and the Soviet people, according to the 1936 constitution, have the freedom to believe or not believe in religion according to their conscience. Although there are many misunderstandings outside, the facts are finally there and cannot be erased with one stroke."

According to a recent statement by Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to Britain, there are now more than 30,000 independent religious societies in Russia, which are not supported by the state, but can continue to perform their duties and are even very prosperous. This is probably because Christianity has deep roots in the mysticism of the Russian people and has not been eliminated! (To be continued)

### Public Works Department Approves Further Reduction in Electricity Consumption; Limited Quantity Changes at Any Time Due to Lack of Materials

The Public Works Department has recently issued Announcement No. 5691, which will further restrict electricity allocation from today. The amount of electricity allocated to various types of users has been approved as follows:

User Category Allocation

Transportation and Public Utilities 70%

Houses and Residences (excluding air conditioning) 60%

Industrial (excluding hygiene, food, and essential services) 45%

Luxury Goods (including air conditioning) 45%

Entertainment Venues (excluding air conditioning) 45%

Users with monthly consumption below 500 kWh Limited to 500 kWh

Standard Electricity Calculation Method

Note: The so-called allocation refers to the percentage of each user's standard electricity consumption. The so-called standard electricity consumption refers to the highest total electricity consumption in any month during the electricity consumption period from January of last year to January of this year. For users with less than 1,000 kWh, their highest electricity consumption is determined based on the electricity consumption period from December of last year to November of this year.

Multiple of Fees for Exceeding Electricity Consumption

Users whose electricity consumption is within the allocation will be charged according to the usual electricity price. Electricity exceeding the limit will be charged according to the following table: If the excess over the allocation does not exceed 5%, the excess portion will be charged three times the average electricity price. If the excess over the allocation is more than 5% but not more than 15%, the first 5% of the excess portion will be charged three times the average electricity price, and the remaining portion will be charged six times. If the excess over the allocation is more than 15%, the first 5% of the excess portion will be charged three times the average electricity price, the next 10% will be charged six times, and the remaining portion will be charged 50 times. If any user exceeds the allocation in any month, even if they pay according to the above method, the exceeded portion will be deducted from the allocation in the following month. If the allocation that has been deducted is exceeded again, the electricity supply will be stopped immediately until the Special Committee approves reconnection. (Note) The so-called excess electricity consumption refers to the percentage by which the allocation is exceeded, not the percentage by which the standard electricity consumption is exceeded.

Starting Date

Any user whose standard electricity consumption is 500 kWh or less per month, and who exceeds 500 kWh in any month, will be charged according to the above charging method for the exceeded portion. This revised electricity consumption restriction rate will apply to bills for the electricity consumption period starting from the date the Shanghai Electric Power Company notifies the user in writing. Given the lack of fuel, the allocation of electricity may be revised at any time without prior notice to the user. The revised allocation will be implemented from the date the written notice is delivered to the user, and may be determined during any billing period when necessary, and will be implemented from the date the written notice is delivered to the user.

However, money orders above 20 yuan will still have to be postponed and the payment method will be agreed upon later. Since the current savings deposit stipulates that a maximum of only 20 yuan can be withdrawn, depositors have complained bitterly. It is now learned that the Savings and Remittance Bureau is also consulting with the Postal Administration on a method, and it is expected that the withdrawal limit will be appropriately increased soon.

### Various Noodle Shops Hope to Continue Operating; Will Not Renew Licenses Next Year if No Request for Assistance is Made; The Public's Rush to Buy Bread Yesterday Was Unnecessary

According to the Public Works Department, all retail stores, bakeries, noodle shops, sesame cake shops, and other large users of flour that have obtained licenses from the Bureau and cannot obtain a supply of flour should request assistance from the Bureau before the 29th of this month to maintain their business. If flour is needed but no request for assistance is made to the Bureau, the licenses will not be renewed from next year. One point that needs to be solemnly declared is that the unsealing of various flour godowns is progressing smoothly, and a supply of flour can now be obtained, but the quantity will be subject to the authorities' restrictions. The Bureau hopes that the above-mentioned industries can continue to operate so that the public can easily purchase essential foods.

Ningbo-Style Pastries May Be Discontinued

The authorities of the two concessions have new instructions for manufacturers of bread, biscuits, etc.: from today, stop selling retail bread and various biscuits and pastries to save flour. However, it is learned that family bread will still be produced and sold as usual to meet the public's legitimate needs. Ningbo-style pastries sold by North-South Goods Stores may also be discontinued from today in order to ensure that there will be no shortage of flour supply in the future.

Unnecessary to Rush to Buy Bread

Yesterday morning, a large number of Chinese and foreign citizens gathered in front of several large food stores such as Sullivan on Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road, waiting in line to buy bread. When a staff member of the Public Works Department replied to the reporter about this matter, he said that the blame lies with the public, as there is absolutely no need to wait in line to buy bread. After the Japanese authorities reopened the flour warehouses, there is absolutely no shortage of bread in Shanghai. The only reason for waiting in line to buy bread is that citizens personally or ordered servants to go to a few large food stores instead of going to nearby small food stores to buy bread. It is difficult to understand why citizens do this. It is probably because citizens mistakenly believe that there is a shortage of bread and that only large food stores can be sure to buy it all day long. In fact, bread is abundant everywhere in the city, so please help to eliminate the situation by going to the nearest store to buy bread and not creating unnecessary rush buying. At the same time, the rice situation in the Public Concession is normal, but due to the lack of gasoline, handcarts are used to transport rice, which cannot speed up the transportation of rice to various retail stores. As for those who are still waiting in line in front of rice shops in the two concessions, the main reason is that many small people return after buying enough rice for their immediate needs in order to buy more. Therefore, the Public Works Department is studying methods to identify rice buyers to prevent them from returning after buying.

### Factories Reduce or Shut Down; Serious Unemployment Problem; Various Industries Discuss Methods with the Japanese Side; Suggest Issuing Travel Expenses to Send People Back to Their Hometowns

The English-language "Ta Mei Evening News" reported that tens of thousands of Chinese male and female industrial workers in this city have already lost their jobs or are expected to lose them soon. Sending them back to their hometowns is an urgent and serious problem that the Japanese side in Shanghai and the British and American industrial employers are now working together to consider.

Discussing Methods

The Japanese business community in this city has initiated the convening of informal talks with British and American industrial owners in the past few days to discuss ways to deal with the situation of industrial workers in Shanghai. In the past two weeks, the number of unemployed industrial workers in Shanghai has been quite large. Although the authorities are doing their best to reduce the number of unemployed workers to an absolute minimum, the continued reduction of work in many factories is unavoidable, which seems bound to increase the number of unemployed workers here.

Returning to Hometowns

The newly unemployed workers have all received severance pay and do not need assistance at present. However, they have very few opportunities to find jobs in other factories in Shanghai, so once the current funds are used up, they may become a heavy burden on the city's residents. Industrial owners of various nationalities agree with the idea of sending the unemployed workers from Shanghai back to their hometowns in the interior and suggest that those who are about to be laid off should be given travel expenses to enable them to travel. It is heard that the Japanese authorities will provide facilities such as permits for the repatriation of unemployed workers and permission to carry personal belongings.

Four Major Car Companies Negotiate Dismissal

More than 1,600 drivers of the four major taxi companies are demanding severance pay due to the closure of the companies. It is heard that the capital side has agreed to pay this month's salary and a bonus of two months' salary per person, and retain their positions. However, the labor side insists that the capital side pay a bonus of twelve months' salary per person and pay 300 yuan per month to the taxi drivers' union. Negotiations are still in progress, but it is generally believed that a resolution is not far away.

Workers in Various Industries Dismissed One After Another

One hundred and ten workers at the Central Machine Steel Ingot Factory at 550 Wuding Road went on strike from the 16th of this month because their request for a pay raise was not granted. It is now heard that the capital side has agreed to raise wages, so the workers have unconditionally resumed work.

After the closure of the Moller Steamship Company and the dismissal of its employees, more than 700 dockworkers demanded six months' severance pay. The capital side only offered one week's severance pay, resulting in a stalemate in negotiations that has lasted for many days and has not yet been resolved. Fourteen delivery workers at Green Spot Orange Juice Company were fired by the company and demanded severance pay. The capital side paid 500 yuan per person, and the labor dispute has been resolved.

The Oriental Transportation Company is also holding negotiations between labor and management on the issue of closure and dismissal. The negotiations have now ended, and each employee will receive a bonus of two months' salary.

### Thaikong Company Bread Van Robbed

At around 3:00 pm yesterday, a Thaikong Food Company cargo tricycle, fully loaded with bread to be delivered somewhere, was passing near Hankou Road and Fujian Road when it was suddenly attacked by a number of beggars who rushed forward when the car stopped and devoured all the bread in the car in an instant before fleeing. It is said that street food vendors and food delivery people have recently been at risk of being robbed.

### French Concession Authorities Prohibit Gift Giving

In view of the fact that the winter solstice and New Year are approaching, residents in the concession often prepare gifts for the public officials of the Consulate, the Public Works Department, and the Police Station to cultivate relationships. The French Consul General in this city, M. Magre, recently reiterated the prohibition, citing French laws, and advised all sectors not to take unnecessary actions.

### The Woman Who Committed Suicide in the All Star Hotel is the Daughter-in-Law of a Wealthy Merchant; The Body Has Been Claimed by Family Members

At around 7:00 am the day before yesterday (the 20th), a middle-aged woman suddenly jumped from the window of the seventh floor of the All Star Hotel on Jiangxi Road, falling to the ground. She was seriously injured at the time and was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by police officers. It is now learned that the woman is the daughter-in-law of a wealthy merchant surnamed Su Zhou, who is traveling in Shanghai. After being injured by jumping from the building and being sent to the hospital, she died shortly after. It is heard that the woman was always quarreling with her in-laws, husband, etc., and had ten children, both boys and girls. The reason for her suicide this time is unknown. Yesterday, after the woman's body was examined, it was claimed and coffined by her family members.

### Drivers of Taxis at Delorme Company Demand Maintenance Fees

The Delorme Company's taxis on Avenue Foch have stopped operating due to lack of gasoline, causing all employees to suddenly lose their jobs. At 4:00 pm yesterday, about 300 employees gathered at the company to demand maintenance fees from the capital side. After the French Police Department's political department sent personnel to mediate, the company initially agreed to pay two months' salary, which was inconsistent with the employees' opinions. After interrogation by the police station, they were all released at around 7:00 pm.

Yesterday, the newspaper's publishing time was 6:10 pm.

### Unreturned Change for Foreign Rice Sales Reaches 600,000 Yuan; Rice Merchants Request That Two Foreign Firms Be Ordered to Clear the Debt

The Rice and Grain Office yesterday continued to handle the applications of various rice shops for the allocation of foreign rice for sale, and also began to accept the applications of hospitals, schools, and factories. Therefore, the number of people who went to the office to fill out forms and pay was increasing. The foreign rice that was allocated to various rice shops yesterday for retail sales was still distributed from the Taikoo, Xiamen Road Shinyuan, and Baker Road Motai warehouses on the Bund. Yesterday, the opened warehouse of the Taikoo godown was still Warehouse No. 2, starting from 3:00 pm until it was completely distributed at 4:00 pm, with a total of 1,110 bags of rice. Except for 110 bags belonging to passenger rice, the rest were all applied for by various rice shops to meet the retail sales.

Piloting Stamping

Some rice shops yesterday implemented the practice of stamping the palms of the hands of retail buyers with the seal issued by the Public Works Department for recording. The seals are changed daily, and the color is green. During the implementation, the rice shops felt that the hands were troublesome and will request the Public Works Department to make improvements. The ink becomes blurred after a few hours.

Request for Return of Change

In the past, the procedures for paying for and delivering Hong Kong foreign rice directly purchased by the Public Works Department were handled by the British firm Jebsen & Jessen Trading Co., Ltd.. At that time, for the sake of speed and convenience, the rice payments were all paid in whole numbers, and it was planned to return the change (overpaid amount) on a regular basis. The same method was adopted for the distribution and sale of foreign rice stored in warehouses by various rice shops this time. It is heard that the total amount of change from the two cases is about 600,000 yuan in legal currency. Although the guild has sent letters urging the repayment, it has not been returned. In view of the current tight money and difficulty in turnover, it is heard that the industry is requesting the authorities to order the two foreign firms to clear the debt as soon as possible.

### Explosion and Fire at Daming Chemical Plant

A sudden explosion and fire occurred at the Daming Chemical Plant at 663 Great Western Road at 5:38 pm yesterday. The fire was extinguished and reduced after the fire brigade drove to the scene to put it out. At the time, a worker named Xu Fusheng, 21 years old, was severely injured by the explosion and died before he could be treated.

### Western Youth Basketball Tournament; Blue and White B Beat Shanghai Bank Yesterday; Monacos Defeat Chen You by a Wide Margin

There were originally three competitions in the Western Youth Basketball Tournament yesterday. Due to the withdrawal of Liangxi in Group A, only two games remained in Group B. In the first game, Monacos vs. Chen You, the strength of the two sides was far apart, and the game became one-sided. In the first half, the score was 12 to 2, with Chen You's Xu Shengzhi making a solo contribution. After the break, Chen You was even more unable to support, and only Wang Liyi scored a point on a free throw. As a result, Monacos defeated Chen You by a large margin of 34 to 3. In the second game, Blue and White B vs. Shanghai Bank, the game was full of wonderful moments. After the start, Shanghai Bank's Pan Jianhua scored a red heart first. Blue and White's Huang Peijun scored two goals. Gao Xilin scored on a free throw. Blue and White took the lead with 5 to 2. Shanghai Bank's Pan Jianhua and Zhou Jun each scored a goal, tying the score at 5 to 5. Blue and White B's Huang Peijun and Xu Zuzui suddenly became active again, exceeding again with 11 to 5. Then, Shanghai Bank's Zhou Jun made a contribution, and Gao Xilin also scored for Blue and White. The first half ended with Blue and White B taking the lead with 13 to 9. After the break, Shanghai Bank's Ye Zuyao made a successful sneak attack, and Zhou Zhixin scored on a free throw, tying the score at 13 to 13 for the second time. Blue and White's Huang Peijun put the ball in under the basket, and Huang Zhijun scored on a free throw, taking the lead again with 16 to 13. At this time, Gao Xilin was sent off for four fouls. Shanghai Bank launched a counterattack, tying the score at 16 to 16 for the third time. At this time, the atmosphere suddenly became tense. In the last few seconds, Blue and White's Huang Peijun made a wonderful comeback and actually scored a goal. Soon, the time ran out, and Blue and White B defeated Shanghai Bank with a score of 18 to 16. Now, in addition to Blue and White, Liangxi has announced its withdrawal from the competition. It is heard that Shanghai Star and Lianxing also intend to withdraw. Therefore, only three teams remain: Giant, Fuli, and Zhongyi, and the interest in competition has decreased even more. Also, the three competitions that were originally scheduled for tomorrow have been cancelled due to Christmas Eve. There will be no games this week and will be continued next year. The results of yesterday's game between Blue and White B and Shanghai Bank are recorded below.

Business News

### Financial System: Recent Developments

Since December 8th, Shanghai's financial situation has undergone several changes: The business hours of all banks have been shortened to 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, totaling three hours. Withdrawals are restricted; for deposits made before December 8th, withdrawals are uniformly limited to 500 yuan, permitted once every three days. For all current account withdrawals, banks are to adhere to the "Provisional Measures for Banking and Money Shop Operations" as resolved by the Provisional Joint Conference of the Shanghai Bankers and Money Dealers Association, concerning balances up to December 6th, 1941. Cash payments should be limited to checks presented directly at the counter. Checks collected by Chinese and foreign counterparts on behalf of depositors, unless the original check bears a stamp indicating "Cash Payment" or similar wording that has not been crossed out, should be settled through transfer procedures. Cash deposited after December 8th should be placed in a separate cash account. Banks should stamp the word "Cash" on blank checks issued for these accounts. All checks drawn on cash accounts, whether presented directly at the counter or through clearing, should be paid in cash. Banks that issued blank checks with "Cash Payment" or equivalent stamps to depositors before December 6th, 1941, should notify depositors to cross out these stamps. Otherwise, checks submitted for clearing by foreign banks will be paid by the clearinghouse from the bank's cash account. A foreign bank clearing group has been established, including Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Chosen, Bank of Taiwan, Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Banque de l'Indochine, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, Banca Italo-Cinese, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Banque Franco-Chinoise, and Shanghai (Hongkou) branches of thirteen banks as members, with the Joint Reserve Committee of the Shanghai Banking Association participating to facilitate clearing. Chinese banks deposit funds with HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Chase Bank. After reconciliation, the balances of Chinese banks held in these four foreign banks are drawn through checkbooks issued by Yokohama Specie Bank, in the form of overdrafts with signed checks indicating only the amount. These deposits in the four foreign banks serve as collateral. All mortgage loans made by Chinese banks each week must be reported for review. Originally, "crossed checks" were for same-day cash withdrawals, but now they are processed as remittances, with the old remittance terminology abolished. "Crossed checks" are now no different from the old remittances. Since crossed checks cannot be cashed, cash must be obtained through discounting. The initial discounting volume was substantial, but recently it has stabilized, with rates at 0.3% or even at par. The trend is towards carrying cash, which is cumbersome and risky. Eventually, a large amount of cash will flow into the market, and perhaps there will be no more discounting in the future; it is even possible that crossed checks will trade at a premium. (White)

### Cash Enters the 10,000 Yuan Barrier

The black market price of gold has plummeted alarmingly, penetrating the 10,000 yuan mark. Public sentiment is down amidst various rumors, and the flow of physical gold has surged. In the morning, around 9:30 AM, some silver firms traded ten taels (ten liang) at 10,700 yuan. When the Jin Hao Bang Cheng Ji firm aggressively bought 50 taels, prices temporarily rose to 11,000 yuan. Shortly after, a certain bank suddenly dumped its holdings, and Tian Yuan, the exchange shop Xin Feng Yong, and a certain gold firm aggressively sold, causing a sharp decline to around 10,600 yuan. Securities firms and the silver trade association Gong He bought in, attempting to stabilize the market. However, banks continued to sell aggressively, with Tian Yuan and Shi He competing to sell, accelerating the decline. Upon falling below 10,000 yuan, there were even fewer buyers, and the price plummeted by 1,600 yuan, with one transaction at a low of 9,000 yuan for ten taels, absorbed by securities firms and Cheng Ji. A certain silversmith reduced purchases. Around 11:00 AM, the price recovered to 9,700-9,800 yuan. Tian Yuan sold again, dragging it down to 9,350 yuan. Subsequently, trading thinned, and bargain hunters emerged, pushing the price back up to 9,500-9,600 yuan. No further transactions occurred in the afternoon, and the price remained around 9,500 yuan, down 1,200 yuan from last Saturday. Over the past two weeks, the price has fallen by over 4,300 yuan. The price difference on the day was 2,000 yuan, with a trading volume of several hundred taels. The exchange rate for gold ornaments decreased three times at Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, falling a total of 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan per tael. Purchases were reduced by 200 yuan. Silver ingots remained at 18 yuan per tael, and the black market price was 11 yuan.

### Bond Market Reopens

The bond market resumed trading yesterday. Trading began at 9:30 AM and closed at 10:00 AM. Settlement matters were handled after 10:00 AM, conveniently within bank clearing hours. There was no afternoon session. The bond market was the first to resume operations. The market was lively with attendees yesterday. Upon opening, Western bonds were priced at 63.8 yuan, and Type A bonds traded at 69 yuan, aligning with off-market prices. However, there was a surge in sellers, particularly Tong Yi. Zhong Fu offered Type E bonds, while Run De and Jiu Feng also sold. Most were forced liquidations. Buyers included Le Mao and Geng Xing, and speculative short covering was also significant. Type C bonds traded as low as 60.05 yuan, nearly breaking the 60 yuan barrier. Type E bonds opened at 61 yuan and rose to 62 yuan, but ultimately broke the 60 yuan barrier as well. Type A bonds traded at a minimum price of 64 yuan, and Type B bonds traded at a minimum price of 60.08 yuan, making them the most cost-effective among the various bond types. Type B and Type C bonds were priced at par, while Type A bonds were only 3.7 yuan higher than Type C bonds. The market price was about 2 to 4 yuan lower than the off-market price on the 20th, and a sharp decline of 6.5 to 9.8 yuan compared to the closing price on the 6th of this month. Approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan worth of bonds were traded. A summary table is listed below.

Cotton mills fell to 25 yuan, reclamation to 18 yuan, and Asia shipyard stocks to around 10 yuan. Other utility and rubber stock prices were halved from their pre-suspension (5th) closing prices.

### National Rice Supply Is Not Smooth or Unimpeded

Although the national rice supply was interrupted for one day on Sunday, there was no significant accumulation. Only about 210 shi arrived. Demand from buyers was subdued due to the recent price declines. Although vendors initially quoted 261 yuan for Bo Dao rice in the morning, no deals were made. Trading started only after the price dropped to 255 yuan, but sellers remained willing to sell. Ultimately, the lowest price was only 252 yuan. There was no market for Hou Geng rice due to a lack of supply. As for foreign rice, warehouses such as Taikoo, Butterfield & Swire, and Standard Oil have reopened, but only rice designated for public use can be released. Therefore, crowds still gather in front of the stabilized rice price shops, and panic buying has not subsided. Restoring operations at all stores under proper management would alleviate congestion and stabilize the food supply. Recently, the rice trade in the French Concession has been active, while it has been sluggish in the International Settlement. It is said that small packages are piled up and cannot be distributed, which is why the food supply within the Settlement remains difficult.

### Yarn Prices Continue to Weaken; 600 Bales of Yao Cotton Arrive

The yarn market is currently stable, but mill prices are trending weaker. This is due to the sharp decline in gold prices, which has created uncertainty. The mill price for 20-count Shuang Ma yarn is 1,750 yuan, down 110 yuan from Saturday. Ten bales were traded on the yarn exchange. However, the spot price for 20-count Shuang Ma is 2,060 yuan, the spot price for 20-count Tian Nu yarn is 2,365 yuan, and the price for 20-count Lan Feng yarn is 2,200 yuan. No other transactions were reported.

The exchange held a meeting yesterday morning with the authorities and brokers. As a result, it was decided that due to the year-end, operations would resume on January 10th of next year. The authorities have allowed for the extension of settlement for all contracts expiring in December of this year.

Cotton trading was hampered by warehouse deposits and no deals were made. The domestic cotton supply is entirely under control, resulting in very few Hua Yi cotton from Jiangbei and Tongzhou this autumn. Very little cotton has arrived from eastern Zhejiang. It is known that recently, a number of shipments have arrived by boat from Ningbo. Yesterday morning, the Wan Ji vessel arrived from Ningbo, carrying over 600 bales. The vessel docked at Wharf 13 on the Bund, and cargo was unloaded.

### Cotton Cloth Trading: Spot Settlement Resolved; Futures Unlikely to Resume This Year

The factory cloth market is sluggish. Most cloth merchants, except for retail sales, are making few wholesale transactions at inconsistent prices. There are many transactions for 16-pound Hua Die group cloth. Over the past week, the highest price was 105 yuan, and the lowest was 97.5 yuan. Yesterday, it sold at 99 yuan and 100 yuan, an increase of 7.5 yuan compared to the last price before the market suspension. Yesterday, traders still lacked enthusiasm for transactions. Local demand increased slightly, with over one hundred pieces of rough cloth of the Hua Die brand transacted, along with over two thousand bolts of thread velvet and colored cloth: Ningbo help at 80 yuan, 11-pound Three Rabbit at 70 yuan, 9-pound Five Blessings at 61 yuan, Da Peng fine cloth at 85 yuan, and Fu Gui at 85 yuan and Fu Gui twill at 79 yuan.

Eastern cloth: The exchange held a meeting yesterday with no results. Another meeting is scheduled for the 27th, so a resumption this year is unlikely. The settlement issue for the spot market has been resolved. The factory price for 12-pound Long Tou fine cloth is set at 84 yuan per bolt, and Jun Zi Beji at 3 yuan per yard. Traders settled accounts with each other yesterday morning. There were over one hundred bales of Lao Long Tou fine cloth and about two hundred cases of Si Jun Zi Beji, all settled in cash at the above prices. For new transactions, Long Tou fine cloth traded at 84.5 yuan, while warehouse prices were lower than spot prices, with bids ranging from 83.25 yuan to 83.75 yuan, with 30 to 40 bales traded. The situation was similar for Si Jun Zi Beji: spot prices traded at 3.045 yuan, while factory prices were only 2.975 yuan.

### This Warehouse Handles Sugar Registration

The sugar market is stagnant due to the Bureau of Works handling registration for goods in this warehouse, and the permits are still pending. There are no market transactions. As for the registered goods in other warehouses, there is no practical solution. A proper and feasible regulation is needed before a formal market can be established.

Spring and Autumn

### Designing an Economical Cafeteria

— Jin Yi

Due to the uneven distribution of rice, several restaurants have recently closed their downstairs seating and only serve "upstairs" customers. Because customers who go upstairs always order several jin of wine and several dishes, the capacity of their stomachs is mostly taken up by the wine and dishes before they even get to the rice. Downstairs seating, on the other hand, is for the "rough sorts" who eat three large bowls of rice with a bowl of tofu soup or a plate of yellow bean sprouts. The income is small, and the demand for rice is high, so it's impossible to make a profit. It's the opposite of "opening a restaurant and not fearing big bellies," but the poor are precisely the ones with big bellies.

Moreover, these customers who "can't" go "upstairs," and their families (or even bachelors), mostly "work to eat" and can't find the time to stand in line. So when it's "time for everyone to eat," they hesitate between calculating their money and feeling their bellies.

What should be done with these people? That's why I think the student economical cafeteria at the Northern Sichuan Road YMCA is worth emulating or expanding.

The method of the YMCA student economical cafeteria is like this: All students can purchase an "admission ticket" with their membership card, receive a bowl and chopsticks, and then get their food from the kitchen on a first-come, first-served basis. The price seems to be eight jiao.

Using this method, establish a large cafeteria in a central location in both the British and French Concessions. If there is sincerity to put this into practice, it probably isn't a difficult thing. Here are a few key points that are temporarily proposed:

The cooks should be experienced, because they can buy the most and cheapest ingredients in the market that day. Their cooking skills will naturally be higher.

Selling meal tickets separately would be too troublesome. They can be sold in booklets of five or ten.

Serve both the vegetables and rice in one container, which saves labor and reduces the risk of "breaking bowls."

Have several attendants in the cafeteria (depending on the situation) to collect the used utensils. Naturally, there should also be dedicated staff to handle the washing.

Diners must strictly maintain order.

Service hours should be within two specified times: 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.

As for the rice supply, the person in charge can request it from the authorities in both Concessions, or even ask for their assistance.

Except for all necessary expenses, profits should not exceed one percent, and this one percent should be accumulated as a reserve for emergencies (such as purchasing utensils).

Of course, this is not "doing business," and it should be taken more seriously than "doing business." It is hoped that interested people will come forward to do this professional work, which can also be considered a charitable endeavor.

### Interest

— Zhang Ge

Everyone has their own interests according to their nature. Liking gambling is an interest, liking women is also an interest; focusing on a career is an interest, and focusing on learning is an even greater interest. People without interests find everything dull; with interest, their spirits are a hundredfold.

But the explanation of interest is never this simple. Mr. Liang Rengong once said: If you were to dissect him, there would be nothing but interest. The interest he referred to, which was the essence of his being, was not a general interest, but specifically his dedication to studying and learning, never self-satisfied, never ending, and always full of interest. That is true interest.

"Playing with things ruins ambition." We don't necessarily believe that this is a universal truth, but comparing the interest in gambling and women to the interest in learning, the difference is simply incalculable. In the past and present, the general public's interest has been concentrated on gambling and women. This phenomenon exists among those who are already working, and it's no different for students who are still studying. To give a clear example: the dance halls on North Sichuan Road used to be mostly frequented by college students from Jiangwan. And recently, during the holiday commemorating the birth of Sun Yat-sen, there was news of dozens of university students being arrested for gambling and fined. College students have no interest in studying and take the opposite path. This kind of spirit is unacceptable.

We should encourage ourselves to increase our interest in our careers and studies.

### Returning from Buying Rice

— Dong Zhi

I have recently found pleasure in reading, which nourishes the mind. My family has only a few liters of rice left, and I almost feel the same as Han Le Wu. But standing in line to buy rice is ultimately fruitless. Returning home, I read in Liezi's "On Strength and Fate" that "Dongmen Wu of Wei died without sorrow, and his steward said: 'You loved your son more than anything else in the world. Why are you not sad now that your son has died?' Dongmen Wu said: 'I used to have no son, and I was not sad when I had no son. Now that my son is dead, it is the same as having no son, so why should I be sad? It is the force of circumstances, it is fate.'" I suddenly comforted myself, thinking that I often have no rice, and I was not sad when I had no rice. Now that I cannot buy rice, it is the same as having no rice, so why should I be sad? Then I thought to myself, selling rice is doing everything humanly possible, but not being able to squeeze in line to buy rice is fate. I cannot give up buying rice just because I cannot squeeze in line. This is doing everything humanly possible and awaiting fate.

### Christmas and Joining the Fun

— Tu Tu

On Christmas Eve, mothers secretly fill a new sock with candies and toys. When children wake up early in the morning, they are surprised to receive this gift, believing that it was delivered by a white-bearded Santa Claus while they were asleep. Their little hearts believe this is a miracle, and they look forward to the next Christmas day. In previous years, the almost insane excitement of Christmas Eve would cause many young men and women to fondly recall and look forward to the coming year. The young people's desire for enjoyment and the children's hope of receiving Christmas gifts can be said to be the same longing.

Based on my experience of Christmas, the annual splendid embellishment is entirely made up of many people who love to join the fun. They seem to have been born solely for entertainment, especially the young people, who are the most sincere. Of course, they are not necessarily children of Christ.

In previous years, these days were filled with the atmosphere of the approaching Christmas. People who love to join the fun were already preparing for revelry. This year, however, it is a desolate and bleak sight. Except for a few occasional displays in shop windows with Santa Claus and sparse winter festival gifts, it is almost easy to forget that the holiday is just around the corner. The number of people joining the fun will undoubtedly decrease sharply. Most of them are already struggling in the chains of rice and coal. After all, enjoyment cannot be eaten as food. It is predicted that this year's Christmas will lack people who celebrate the occasion, and Santa Claus will just have to stare blankly and sigh repeatedly.

### Begonia

— Qin Shou'ou

Fifteen. "Dad, let's go busking!"

Besides trying his best to comfort her, Mei Bao herself was always extra cautious. No matter what day it was, she never wore bright clothes, always wearing a blue cloth jacket on top. Powder and rouge had been completely separated from her since the day she started busking. When singing in front of customers, although she didn't keep her face as if she was angry with them, she never laughed lightly. If a customer asked something, she always let the girl from the Han family respond. She just stood quietly on the side.

"That tall girl is really pretty, but it's a pity she doesn't talk, like a clay beauty." Because Mei Bao didn't open her mouth, customers often discussed her like this.

Hearing this, Qiu Haitang, of course, felt very annoyed. In fact, saying a few words quietly like this, with the scope of the conversation limited to comments and evaluations, was still considered a good customer! Some simply treated them like prostitutes, pulling hands and pouring wine. If it weren't for the Han family father and daughter always standing in front, Qiu Haitang would have been fighting with people every day, and the few coins they earned would only be enough to buy some band-aids and medicinal cotton wool!

### Discussing "Family Entertainment": Plucking the Zither Under a Coptis Tree

— Meng Zhao

For the past five years, I have not stepped into a movie theater once, because life is hard, my mood is bad, and it's not easy to earn money. What mood do I have for entertainment? Since the January 28th Incident and the outbreak of the Pacific War, life has been even harder and the economy even more difficult! Such melancholy and boredom are, in spirit, a great loss! So how to adjust? Watch Peking opera? Watch movies? Neither is affordable. "Plucking the zither under a Coptis tree," I think the only way is to practice "family entertainment." So-called "family entertainment" includes playing the harmonica or organ; playing Go or Chinese chess; gathering the family to tell stories; studying books, paintings, bronzes, and stones; enjoying tea and conversation; playing finger-guessing games or drinking games; or even playing "hygienic mahjong" once a day (the number of rounds should be small). The sole purpose of recreation is to cleanse worldly thoughts and relieve mental and physical distress. In this increasingly turbulent era, saving a penny is a penny, and saving a cent is a cent. The enjoyment of material entertainment may be bitter, but mental aspects must be specially adjusted. What do readers think?

Recently, due to the busy schedules of various members, they have no time to act, so they have announced their dissolution after "Going to Work" and "Going to the Theater."

The Jin Xing Film Company, established for more than a year, has suspended operations due to the impact of the war, so the "Eternity" directed by Shu Shi has also been aborted.

### Blood Rain on the Fine Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 20: Lighting Candles to Welcome the Battlefield

The next day, the Qing army discovered the incident and arrested nearby residents, asking about the murderer, but could not find any clues. Prince Regent Dorgon was enraged by the writing on the tree, believing it had insulted the Qing army. He severely reprimanded his subordinates to step up the search and ordered his troops to abide by discipline and not to leave the camp without reason. He had the heads on the trees and the corpses in the river collected and buried. He did not know who had done this deliberately to provoke the Qing army, so he had the words carved on the tree and the heads hung on the branches. He also believed that this matter could not be done by ordinary people, because the heads were hung very high and it was not easy to take them down. He suspected that the Ming generals under Wu Sangui might have secretly colluded with the Qing soldiers to oppose him. Therefore, he notified Wu Sangui and instructed him to strictly question his subordinates and not to seek revenge. Wu Sangui naturally obeyed and issued an edict. However, he was still obsessed with Yuanyuan, and because he could not find her, he was unusually upset. He volunteered to Prince Regent Dorgon to pursue and capture Li Chuang. Prince Regent Dorgon also needed to use troops urgently because the ringleader had not yet been captured, so after discussion, they divided their troops into two groups to pursue and suppress the bandits. Prince Ying Azig and Prince Yu Dodo led the Qing troops as the left wing. Wu Sangui led the Ming troops as the right wing. The Ming soldiers had no choice but to set out after seeing the order. Zhang Cangqiu and others were somewhat dissatisfied, believing that the Ming army, having defeated the bandits with the help of the Qing army and recovered Yanjing, should appease the people, quickly establish a Ming descendant, and settle the grand plan as soon as possible. Although the bandits should be pursued and suppressed, compared to each other, it was better to let the bandits eke out a living. Now, the reason why Wu Sangui insisted on pursuing them was for his beloved concubine Chen Yuanyuan, vowing to retrieve her, unwilling to let go, showing that the general's heart was only on [omitted] and not on the great plan of the country.

### Talents Cultivated by the Opera School (Part 2)

— Yan Xi

(C) Jing (Painted Face) Zhou Zhengli - Truly a rare talent in the present era. It is truly a gratifying thing that he has such achievements. He is skilled in posture. What satisfies me most about his performances is "Shepherd's Tiger Pass," Sima Yi in "Empty City Stratagem," and "Golden Terrace."

Wang Zhengsen - Probably very young! His voice seems very tender, but it is very pleasant to listen to, especially his recitations. He rarely plays leading roles. I remember Li Kui in "Raising Havoc in Qingzhou" was very good.

Wang Zhengpeng - Good voice, but too few roles!

(D) Chou (Clown) Xing Zhenghao - It is very difficult to sing and act as a small Hua Lian (Painted Face), especially when children do it. If the clown is a very, very small child, it is easy to make people laugh because they are small. But that is not the case with him. There are many people smaller than him in the opera school, such as Sun Zhengyang and Wang Zhenglian, who also play small Hua Lian, but he is not considered the best. Although he has pitifully few roles, please watch Zhang Biegu in "The Urn Case" and the gatekeeper in "Panguan." How clear his articulation is, how beautiful his movements are! But the opera school has given many small Hua Lian roles to Sun Zhengyang. It is a pity for him. I hope the opera school will not bury a bright star.

Sun Zhengyang - Actually, he is not bad either. Because he is small, he easily attracts attention and laughter. Sometimes his recitations are like reciting a book, with no tone, and his face lacks expression. His signature roles are Jia Gui in "Famen Temple" and Chong Gongdao in "Taking the Woman Away."

Wusheng (Martial Actor) Jing Zhengfei - He is clean, light as a swallow, and has a small braid on his head, which is most noticeable. He always receives a full house of applause when he performs.

There are many other good talents, such as Zheng Zhengxue, Lu Zhengmei, Peng Zhengling, Wang Zhengkang, and Zhou Zhengwen, who are all very good. Because they made a shallower impression on me, I have not written about them individually. The above is entirely my personal opinion. Of course, benevolent people see benevolence, and wise people see wisdom. It cannot be generalized.

Miscellaneous Arts Talk

### The Adjutant Play

— Ze Fu

The comic drama of the Tang Dynasty was called the Adjutant Play. The term "adjutant" (參軍) was originally an official title, and there are three different theories about its origin. One theory states that it began in the Later Han Dynasty when Shi Dan, the magistrate of Guantao, committed an offense. Emperor He, valuing his talent, spared him from punishment. During every banquet, he was made to wear a white jacket and ordered the actors to humiliate him. This continued for a year before he was released, later becoming an adjutant. Another theory suggests it began in the Later Zhao Dynasty when Zhou Yan, an adjutant of Shi Le and the magistrate of Guantao, was imprisoned for wrongly adjudicating several bolts of silk. He was later pardoned after someone interceded on his behalf. Afterwards, during every gathering, actors would ridicule him in jest. A third theory claims it originated in the Tang Dynasty. During the Kaiyuan era, Li Xianhe was skilled in acting, and Emperor Ming specifically appointed him as the Military Adjutant of Shaozhou. According to all accounts, each mentions the magistrate of Guantao, and the events are generally the same. Wang Guowei believes that the account from the Later Zhao Dynasty is more credible. It seems that in ancient times, there were actual events that people imitated and then gradually developed into the Adjutant Play. The play primarily focused on teasing and ridiculing, and there were also songs and female performers. For example, Fan Chu's "Xi You Yi" states, "When I inquired about Zhejiang East, there were actors Zhou Ji Nan, Ji Chong, and his wife Liu Caichun, who came from Huaidian and were skilled at performing the Adjutant Play, their singing voices piercing the clouds." Today, many comic actors also sing, and it's not merely about eliciting laughter through words and actions.
