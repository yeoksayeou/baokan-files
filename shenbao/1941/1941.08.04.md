### Meeting with British, Australian, and South African Envoys to Discuss Tense Far East Situation; Special Attention to Japanese Threat of Southern Advance; US, British, Dutch, and Indian Military Strength Increasingly Enhanced

United Press International, Washington, 3rd: The State Department had important activities yesterday, involving Under Secretary of State Welles meeting with diplomatic envoys and representatives of Pacific shipping companies. Welles met with British Ambassador Halifax, Australian Minister Casey, South African Minister Cross, Soviet Ambassador Umansky, and Japanese Ambassador Nomura. The main topic of discussion at this meeting with diplomats and shipping representatives was clearly the threat posed by Japan in the South Pacific, particularly Japan's demands for bases in Thailand. This move would bring the Axis powers' Far Eastern partners closer to Singapore and could potentially lead to a flank attack on China's Burma Road. Diplomatic circles believe that President Roosevelt's ban on oil exports is a warning to Japan: if Japan attempts to invade the Dutch East Indies, it will risk war. At the same time, if Japan does not invade the Dutch East Indies, the US may be willing to allow oil exports to Japan. This move is seen as an extremely powerful economic weapon in America's economic and military campaign in East Asia. According to the State Department, Hull has been at the Sulfur Springs in Virginia for over a month. He is on vacation but remains in contact with the State Department by telephone regarding the international situation.

Reuters, Washington, 3rd: British Ambassador to the US Halifax, accompanied by the Australian and South African ministers, visited Acting Secretary of State Welles to discuss the Far East situation. Afterwards, when speaking with reporters, none of them explained the specific events they considered, only indicating that they paid special attention to Japan's southern advance.

US Army and Navy Prepared to Take Free Action Against Japan

United Press International, Washington, 3rd: Political authorities stated yesterday that President Roosevelt's embargo on aircraft, gasoline, and lubricants to Japan indicates that the US Army and Navy's preparedness has greatly improved. The government no longer fears any strong retaliation from Tokyo against the US. These people said that the US clearly does not want to provoke Japan, but believes it is now powerful enough to take absolutely free action against Japan to weaken Japan's freedom to attack America's allies and American interests in the Pacific. This feeling is said to be deep-seated because Vice President Roosevelt recently stated that in the past, the US had avoided banning oil exports to Japan to prevent Japan from taking unfavorable actions against the US and other democracies due to these restrictions. Political experts say that the US announcement of an oil embargo to Japan indicates that President Roosevelt no longer believes excessive caution is necessary. Experts say that this move is clearly the result of recent increased cooperation between the US, Britain, and the Netherlands in the Pacific to enhance their military strength. Experts also said that the Soviet Union's strong resistance to the German invasion, and the inability of Britain and the US to cooperate with each other, are also sufficient to support Roosevelt's attitude. Washington diplomatic experts, including foreign experts residing here, believe that the following reasons are factors that prompted the president's embargo: (1) Rumors that Japan has demanded bases in Thailand, (2) The US is very angry about the bombing of the US gunboat "Panay" in the past, believing that Japanese planes used American-made gasoline to bomb the US ship, (3) China's continuous demands for the US to stop exporting raw materials to Japan, so that Japanese planes can no longer attack Chongqing, (4) The Soviet Union needs aviation gasoline. Diplomats also pointed out that President Roosevelt's planned trip next week indicates that the president believes that Japan is unlikely to immediately attack the interests of any democracies.

### US Oil Export Ban Causes Extreme Anxiety in Japan; US-Japan Commercial Relations Likely to Be Completely Severed

Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd: The expansion of US restrictions on oil exports has increased the anxiety among the general public here regarding future relations between the US and Japan. Although those with a calmer attitude want to wait and see how the restrictions on Japan are implemented, those with a sense of panic believe that this move by the US is entirely anti-Japanese in nature and is deeply regrettable. The fate of the Japanese ships "Tatsuta Maru" and others leaving San Francisco and Seattle is also a matter of great concern.

Reuters, Washington, 3rd: Senator George, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters that if Japan no longer engages in aggression, the US may consider a barter system to continue trade with Japan. The US authorities' economic measures against Japan seem to be moving towards a complete severance of commercial relations, but if Japan ends its aggression, there is still hope for continued trade, but this hope is very weak.

United Press International, Washington, 3rd: Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters yesterday that he guessed that Japan has one to two years' worth of oil and gasoline reserves, prepared for war. However, he said that this is "pure speculation." Knox made this statement in response to questions about the impact of President Roosevelt's embargo on aviation fuel, engine oil, and all other oils.

### US Army Begins Exercises to Defend the West Coast

United Press International, San Francisco, 3rd: The Fourth Army exercise began yesterday, with more than 100,000 troops participating. Yesterday, a hypothetical Red Navy began a hypothetical occupation of Hawaii in preparation for an attack on the US West Coast next week. From midnight, the 3rd, 7th, 40th, and 41st divisions will rapidly concentrate to defend the coast from enemy attacks. The 17th Infantry Division will represent the enemy. Both the Blue Fourth Army, responsible for defense, and the Red 17th Infantry Division, responsible for attack, will be concentrated in the Presidio and Monterey. To make the exercise realistic, the Blue staff led by Lieutenant General DeWitt does not know where the Red attackers will strike. There are three possible attack locations: (1) Puget Sound and the Columbia River area, (2) The San Francisco-Monterey area, (3) The Los Angeles-San Diego area.

### 25 US Army Officers Sent to Serve in the Far East; Will Depart Separately from San Francisco to Enhance Strength in the Philippines

United Press International, Washington, 3rd: The War Department yesterday dispatched 25 army officers, from captain to lieutenant colonel, to the Far East to strengthen the US Army's forces in the Philippines. These people include seven field artillery commanders, including four lieutenant colonels, one captain, one major, and one captain. Three lieutenant colonels and one major will depart from San Francisco on the 18th. The remaining fourteen coastal artillery captains will depart from San Francisco on the 30th. Another three field artillery commanders will also be traveling with them.

United Press International, Washington, 3rd: The Navy and Army Daily News commented in its editorial yesterday, "Military personnel are extremely satisfied with the President's appointment of MacArthur as the Philippine Defense Commander." United Press International, Honolulu, 3rd, Former Brit

### US President Travels; Whereabouts Kept Strictly Secret

Reuters, Washington, 3rd: Presidential Secretary O'Laughlin said that President Roosevelt boarded his yacht today to travel to New England, and his whereabouts are being kept strictly secret. He may return in a week. If the international situation requires the President to return to Washington, the President can return at any time. In the past, when the President traveled, he always allowed reporters to travel on another ship, but this decision is different.

### British Forces in the Far East Prepared for Battle

United Press International, Honolulu, 3rd: Former Commander of the British Forces in China, Major General Grasett, declared yesterday that the Imperial forces in the Far East and South Pacific are prepared to take action against any aggressor at any time. The Major General was passing through here on a merchant ship en route to England to accept a new assignment. He said that when France collapsed last year, Japan encountered very little opposition in Asia, but if Japan now wants to take action, it is already too late. The Major General pointed out that if Japan had seized all of Vietnam last year, it would have been very easy. At that time, Hong Kong was not strong, Thailand was not prepared, Malaya was completely unprepared, and so were Burma and the Dutch East Indies. But now the situation has completely changed. He also said that the combination of Britain, the US, and the Netherlands has created a terrible force. The East Indies are prepared to deal with any disputes. Countless Australian troops have been trained to defend Malaya all the way to the Thai border, and north of Vietnam, we have built a defense in Hong Kong that is almost impregnable.

Reuters, London, 3rd: The British Admiralty has just announced the appointment of Rear Admiral Spooner to oversee naval facilities in Singapore.

### Japanese Troops Massing on the Border; Serious Situation in Thailand; If Bangkok Government Yields, It Will Provoke British Action

Reuters, Bangkok, 3rd: Thailand has not yet received a formal request from Japan, but according to well-informed sources, Thailand feels isolated, because Britain is engaged in a life-or-death war in Europe and cannot be expected to provide assistance to Thailand, and although the United States has the power to guarantee Thailand's independence, the United States has not yet expressed a willingness to help Thailand. Thailand is a small country and must have a realistic view of the situation. It is known to all that a large Japanese army is now heavily concentrated on Thailand's eastern border, so Thailand can only do its best to befriend its neighbors.

Reuters, Singapore, 3rd: The situation in Thailand is considered extremely serious here, and it is believed that the news from Bangkok is of great significance, because it has clearly stated that Thailand must take reality as a premise in view of the Japanese army gathering on the border. Unless the United States or Britain guarantees Thailand's independence, the development of the situation may be quite rapid. Britain recently stated its policy towards Thailand, which is that Britain itself does not demand special and additional rights, but also does not want to see these special and additional rights given to any other country. If Thailand grants any special and additional rights to Japan, what action Britain will take will naturally be a closely guarded secret. However, the extent of Britain's response will depend on the nature of the rights granted. Officials here refused to comment on this hypothetical future situation and emphasized that only the War Cabinet could state Britain's position on such a major event. The opinion of Chinese people here is that if the Japanese obtain bases in Thailand, although it will not actually increase the threat to Burma and Malaya, China, which is Britain's first line of defense against Japan, will be greatly affected. From its bases in Thailand, Japan will be able to completely cut off China's only lifeline, the Burma Road, in a very short time, because the Soviet Union is currently engaged in a major war, and assistance to China is very limited.

Reuters, Vichy, 3rd: According to Vichy news from Tokyo, Japan is now expanding its naval service personnel. Many half-pay officers and technicians have been called into naval service in accordance with the order implemented yesterday.

Reuters, Berlin, 3rd: According to Vichy news from the German News Agency, the Japanese army's defense plan in Vietnam is almost complete. The occupation of airfields and the stationing of troops may be completed today.

Editorial

### Economic Sanctions and US-Soviet Cooperation

The swift resolution of the "Tutula" incident indicates that the Japanese authorities are unwilling to excessively provoke the United States over some insignificant disputes, and are willing to apologize and compensate to ease the US's tense emotions. However, their recent intensification of pressure on Thailand, demanding military, political, and economic cooperation and joining the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," proves that the sanctions of democratic countries are not enough to curb their expansionist intentions, but instead make them more prepared to carry out risky attempts. Comparing these two situations, one can gain a concrete understanding of the current Japanese policy and the future of the Far East situation.

Since the implementation of the US oil embargo, as of the time of writing, there has been no word of any Japanese reaction. This is not only because Japan lacks equal economic weapons, but also because the Japanese authorities have probably realized the serious significance of the US move: the tighter the economic sanctions, the closer it gets to war. Even if the United States is currently unwilling to start a war in the Pacific, it is also unwilling to pay an unlimited price for it. If the freezing of funds was still a mild warning, then the implementation of this oil embargo is no different from a stern final warning. Not long ago, President Roosevelt stated that the reason why oil exports to Japan were allowed in the past was to avoid threatening the Dutch East Indies, which shows that the final implementation of the embargo means that the United States has made the greatest determination, because the invasion of the Dutch East Indies is tantamount to the signal of the outbreak of war in the Pacific. Although Japan's invasion of the Dutch East Indies and the US's implementation of the embargo are not directly related, the implementation of the embargo at this time also has little decisive effect on the Far East crisis.

Although the situation in Southeast Asia is currently tense, the democratic countries have completed the necessary joint preparations. At present, Britain and the United States also have sufficient leeway to pay attention to the Far East, so if there is no determination to fight a tough battle, it will not be easy to succeed in the southern advance. This is probably also the reason why Japan's actions towards Thailand are currently only limited to exploratory steps. However, it must be known that Southeast Asia is not the only powder keg in the Far East today, and under the "independent" opportunistic policy, there is definitely more than just one expansion plan. The dangerous situation in the South Seas is obvious, but the crisis in Northeast Asia is also rapidly evolving in secret. Such as the Japanese army's concentration towards the northeast region, and the intimidation towards US-Soviet cooperation, it can be seen that the possibility of a northern advance is not lower than that of a southern advance. If the southern advance is met with strong resistance, then their long-accumulated expansionist intentions will inevitably turn northward to vent.

But in the situation surrounding the Pacific, Northeast Asia is unfortunately the weakest link. The past lack of cohesion between the Soviet Union and democratic countries need not be mentioned. Even after the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the safety of the Soviet Union's eastern border was not entrusted to China's brave fight and the democratic countries' anti-aggression cooperation, but instead relied on an extremely unreliable piece of paper, the Neutrality Pact. Recently, as soon as the proposal for US-Soviet mutual assistance was put forward, Tokyo issued intimidating arguments, expressing that it cannot tolerate US-Soviet cooperation in the Far East. From this, the important nature of this cooperation can be seen, which is almost the most powerful move to stabilize the Far East. The emergency preparations in the South Seas may have sufficient defenses, but due to the limitations of the innate strategic situation, it is difficult to actively exert the effect of stopping aggression. If the military bases in Vietnam and Thailand fall into Japanese hands one after another, the self-preservation of Singapore and the Dutch East Indies will also be quite difficult. But in the North Pacific, there are sea and air bases that are sufficient to overlook the entire territory of Japan, and it is also the most convenient route for the United States to take action in the Far East once something happens. If Greenland and Iceland are important relay stations for providing assistance to Britain from the Western Hemisphere, then the military strategic value of the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Maritime Province is far beyond what Greenland and Iceland can match.

Now Hopkins is flying to Moscow to raise various speculations about military cooperation between the two sides in the Far East. The circulation of Haitong News Agency's news on the 2nd that the Soviet Union will provide Vladivostok for US use may make people feel gratified, but the intention of spreading that news may also be focused on provocative effects, in order to promote Japanese action against the Soviet Union. The Nazis hope that Japan will attack the Soviet Union, just as they expect Japan to contain Britain and the United States with the same urgency.

But no matter how the Nazis propagandize and how the Japanese side suspects and guards against, for the sake of stabilizing the Far East and stopping aggression, cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union is an extremely urgent issue. At present, the two sides are at most just conducting preliminary negotiations, while in the northeast, large armies have already gathered and are waiting for an opportunity to move. Here, the urgency of the situation in Northeast Asia must be seriously recognized; if the democratic countries and the Soviet Union cannot quickly seize the opportunity, so that the Maritime Province unfortunately encounters the same fate as Vietnam and Thailand--but this is by no means as easy as dealing with Vietnam and Thailand--then not only will the Soviet Union's war against Germany be negatively affected, thus affecting the overall situation in the European war, but the democratic countries will also lose the most effective strategy to control Japan; even if the United States enters military action from economic sanctions, then the reversal of the Far East future may not be hopeless, but it will inevitably be extremely difficult and twice the effort.

### US Government Sends Note to Vichy; Reprimands Cooperation with Axis Powers; Japanese Occupation of Vietnam Endangers US Security; Future Relations Between the Two Countries Depend on France's Attitude

Reuters, Washington, 3rd: The United States has informed the Vichy government that the United States' attitude towards the Pétain government will depend on the effectiveness of France's defense of its territory to resist aggression by the Axis powers. Acting Secretary of State Welles recently published an article criticizing France's cooperation with the Axis powers, saying that France's inability to resist Japan's invasion of Vietnam endangers US security. The Vichy government has repeatedly assured the US government that it will not cooperate with the Axis powers beyond the obligations stipulated in the armistice agreement and will protect the territory under its rule to resist any aggression from third countries. However, the US government has now received information about the so-called Vietnam Joint Defense Agreement between France and Japan, which directly transfers important French territory to Japan. The French also said that other countries have taken actions that endanger the territorial integrity of Vietnam, so they want to rely on Japan's assistance and have to conclude this agreement. However, the US government cannot accept this explanation. In fact, except for the Japanese government's expansionist purposes, there is no problem threatening Vietnam. I have explained this in detail on June 24. Now France, under the pretext of joint defense, transfers military operation bases and land rights to a country whose territorial desires are well known, resulting in a situation that is directly related to important issues of US security. France has now decided to allow foreign troops to enter a part of its territory and occupy bases within its territory to prepare for operations to attack other countries that have expressed friendship to the French people. France did not refuse Germany to use the convenience of Syria, but refused Britain. In the future, the US government's relationship with Vichy and the authorities in French territory will depend on whether these authorities make every effort to protect their territory and avoid being controlled and governed by countries that intend to use force to conquer or threaten to expand their power.

United Press International, Washington, 3rd: The US government warned the Vichy government yesterday that US-French relations will henceforth depend on how France can resist the Axis powers within its territory. This statement by the US government clearly intends to avoid any changes in French Africa, because the newspapers in Paris, which are occupied by German troops, advocate that France and Germany establish a defense agreement in Africa similar to the one in Vietnam.

United Press International, New York, 3rd: Vichy has been curbed by a new crisis, because various phenomena indicate that Germany may be seeking to control French bases in Africa, or including Dakar. Laval, who was expelled by Pétain last December, may return to Vichy to indicate new French cooperation.

### Japan Transfers Large Army to Reinforce Northeast; Seems to Be About to Attack Vladivostok

United Press International, London, 3rd: Reliable sources said yesterday that Japan has reinforced "Manchukuo" with a powerful force last week. They also said, "The various movements of the Japanese army in Manchukuo and Korea seem to be about to attack Vladivostok." The sources also said that a large number of reinforcements were sent from Japan, and the rest were transferred north from the Asian continent. It is believed that most of the reinforcements are being deployed in the Heilongjiang area, which is the dividing line between "Manchukuo" and Siberia. This military movement by the Japanese is clearly intended to form an equal footing with the Soviet garrison in terms of strength in preparation for an attack on Vladivostok. The reliable sources also said that the German side is now inducing Japan to create disturbances in Siberia in front of the foundry.

### Communist Activities in France

Reuters, London, 3rd: There are reports of disturbances in France. The Paris radio station under German control admitted yesterday that police had arrested 20 communists in Southern Taiwan City and seized a lot of propaganda, and there had been large demonstrations in Lyons and other places, mostly instigated by the Communist Party. All public institutions were guarded by soldiers and police. The radio station also said yesterday afternoon that there would be important changes in the Vichy government, which was related to the US Ambassador Leahy's visit to General Pétain. It is indeed strange that Leahy always feels the need to see Pétain whenever the French government is about to make a major decision. In fact, friends are sometimes more dangerous than enemies. A newspaper in Geneva quoted a visit to Vichy, saying that Vichy had issued a warning to its subordinates, saying that rumors that incidents had occurred somewhere in France were not fabricated, but referred to incidents that were not serious in nature.

### Secret Documents Seized in Syria Prove German and Japanese Collusion

Reuters, London, 3rd: The Free French Command of Tergault issued an article last night, saying that the secret documents seized from General Dentz in Syria proved that the people who control Vichy's foreign policy are actually people, and the German side issued an order not to allow the army

### Japan Formulates Regulations to Control Electricity Distribution

### Regardless of Japanese Advances South or North, Chinese Troops Will Seize the Opportunity to Attack; Northern Henan Troops Frequently Cross the Yellow River Northward; Japanese Build Airfield on the North Bank of the Yellow River: Interview with Luoyang Commander Wen Zhuoqi

Luoyang - General Wen Zhuoqi, commander of the Luoyang garrison and deputy chief of staff of the area, recently told the United Press that regardless of whether the Japanese troops advance south, north, or both, China will be prepared to seize the opportunity to act. Wen refused to comment on rumors that China had planned a counteroffensive. However, General Wen pointed out that whenever the Japanese planned to expand a new combat zone, they initially launched a short and intense offensive on several fronts to cover the movement of their troops. This statement is consistent with reports in local newspapers that the Japanese might launch another offensive in southern Shanxi. General Wen believes that the Japanese have reduced their forces in southern Shanxi. He said that experienced Japanese troops have indeed been withdrawn, but have been replaced by new recruits and mercenaries. Currently, there are a total of 200,000 Japanese troops in southern Shanxi. General Wen also said that large contingents of Chinese troops frequently cross the Yellow River northward. The Japanese have built three emergency landing strips on the north bank of the Yellow River in Jiyuan, Henan Province, and Yuanqu and Fenglin (transliteration), Shanxi Province. Fenglin is directly opposite Tongguan. In addition to these three locations, there are also five airfields already in use in southern Shanxi, namely in Yuncheng, Linfen, Jincheng, Changzi, and Zhuhe (transliteration). Except for Yuncheng, the rest are emergency airfields. The airfield in Yuncheng is a complete airfield capable of accommodating heavy bombers, similar to the airfields in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, and Xinxiang (transliteration), northern Henan.

Chongqing - People from the countryside report that the early rice crop this year is very good, with estimated yields of 80-90%. The harvest will gradually begin in mid-month, and some areas have already started harvesting. The decline in rice prices is not without reason. Due to the high grain prices in recent years, the area of rice fields has greatly increased. Even mountainous areas that are not suitable for rice cultivation have been planted. However, when rainfall is uneven, these mountainous areas still lack sufficient water. Therefore, the success of the harvest should not be judged based on these mountainous areas. (1st dispatch)

### The Luce Couple's Visit to Chongqing: A Mountain City (Part 1)

Henry R. Luce, editor of the American magazine Life, and his wife arrived in China by clipper plane across the Pacific in May of this year, flying to Chongqing and having initial meetings with Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang. They also went to the northern front to inspect the Chinese troops' combat situation. After arriving in Chongqing from the war zone, the Luces studied the complex economic and political situation of Free China.

On July 7, Mr. Luce returned to New York and wrote an article describing his personal impressions of this trip to China. The following is a translation of the original article published in Life, so that people living in isolated islands can also get a glimpse of the active situation in Free China.

Mrs. Luce is an excellent photographer, and the attached photos were taken by her with her nimble hands during this extraordinary journey.

At half past two in the morning, we got up in a hotel in Hong Kong and rushed to the airport. Under the lights shining from the baggage room, we shook hands with a stern, enthusiastic, and neatly dressed American pilot. He told me that there were a total of six American pilots serving on this most dangerous civilian airline route in the world. Currently, there are two routes connecting Free China to the outside world: one is the Burma Road, and the other is the air route to Hong Kong, with four Douglas DC-2s and two DC-3s used for round trips. As for the long Sino-Soviet highway, it is not really connected to the rest of the world. Today, there is only one DC-3 flying on the air route, because one of the planes landed at a small airport somewhere the day before we left Chongqing. After the passengers safely disembarked, it was bombed by Japanese planes, and the right wing was completely damaged and unusable.

At 3:00 AM, we began our five-hour long-distance flight in complete darkness, with no light allowed in the cabin, and even smoking was prohibited. Mr. McDonald, the pilot, took off among the mountains of Hong Kong, where we could still see the city's lights twinkling like morning stars. Immediately, it was like a piece of darkness, and we were flying over Japanese-occupied territory. In forty minutes, we passed through Guangzhou. Shortly after, the east turned white, and the clouds were clear. What we saw below was a complex, wonderland-like landscape: a plain producing rice and grain, and mountains of forests. The mountains were arranged in rows, with steep slopes, creating valleys with sufficient space between them. Each mountain, from top to bottom, was covered with rice paddies of different shapes, some square, some round, but mostly silver crescent shapes, arranged one after another, until only forested mountains were visible. Such scenery can only be dreamed of in a child's pure imagination. The peaks and ridges in Chinese landscape paintings, which look a bit bizarre, can be used as a representation of these mountains.

Another hour passed. The mountains became larger and wider, and the fields were crisscrossed, promising an endless abundance of rice. We had arrived in Sichuan, a province that could be self-sufficient. The ground was very wet, and we were very happy to see this situation. The residents of Washington, home to the world's greatest democratic government, all hope that Sichuan will rain often.

Immediately, we saw a place where two large rivers circled into a large loop, dividing the mountains into two sides. Then they converged and flowed downstream, passing through layer upon layer of mountains, to enter the sea. At the confluence of the two rivers was an ancient, ancient city—Chongqing. We landed on the riverbed below the mountain, because the river had not yet risen to this convenient waterway.

We met many people in Chongqing. When we went to the residence of Dr. Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Executive Yuan, we first sat in bamboo sedan chairs up the mountain, and then traveled by car through streets that were neither Chinese nor Western. Kong's residence was a two-story building with four rooms. We received the most courteous hospitality. Dr. Kong accompanied us for breakfast. There was coffee and cream on the table, which was considered a very luxurious treat in Chongqing. Later, we had lunch at the Jialing Hotel, which was located at the other end of the city, on a dog-tooth-shaped river bend. Jialing is the name of a river that flows into the Yangtze River. Except during the rainy season, this river is clear and beautiful year-round. We saw this river turn muddy in two weeks. The Jialing Hotel is the only hotel in Chongqing that accommodates foreigners. Government officials often entertain guests there. On the first day of lunch, we met Mr. Pan, the young and capable head of the Transportation Department. Mr. Pan was about to fly to Rangoon to inspect the Burma Road for two weeks. Mrs. Pan was beautifully dressed, with elegant manners, and warmly welcomed the guests at the table.

I don't think Chongqing looks like a city. I immediately discovered why it wasn't a city. First, of course, it had been bombed, but it took a day to be able to distinguish that pile of rubble and ruins from makeshift structures and ordinary houses for the poor. Second, it is not a typical old-fashioned Chinese city, because there are wide, modern streets in the city, and Western-style buildings can be seen everywhere, but they are built with gray bricks and tiles, usually coated with black mortar. On both sides of the main street are thousands of shops, some new and some old, but the storefronts are always open. In addition, the city is a large pile of gray bricks and tiles, some of which are for building houses, and more of which are ruins after bombing. Hundreds of thousands of people (said to be 600,000) are wandering and bustling in this gray and yellow ruins, living in fear. There are dozens of rickshaws—a long line of rickshaws often goes up and down the hilly streets. Ten years ago, there were only twenty rickshaws in Chongqing. Most of them were transported from Hankou in 1938. These vehicles are dilapidated, the likes of which the author has never seen, but it is said that rickshaw pullers earn a lot of money, far more than university professors and government officials.

That night, there were twenty people dining together in Dr. Kong's small dining room. Sitting next to me was General He Yingqin, who, in terms of army rank, was theoretically second only to Chairman Chiang. Because he has been promoted to this high position in the Chinese military operations in recent years, I imagined him to be a very stern person. But I found him to be very gentle and extremely humble in manner.

When the moonlight shone on the mountains and rivers, we were already drowsily falling asleep under the mosquito nets.

Although Chongqing was bombed, the people remained calm and continued their old businesses. Mrs. Luce holds a giant hat, a gift from Madame Chiang.

### Ukraine's Capital as Target: German Forces Launch New Offensive; Red Army's Resistance Demonstrates Great Strength; German Forces Defeated at Smolensk

Reuter's, London, 3rd: As the seventh week of the Soviet-German war begins, the German side seems to be launching a new offensive against Kyiv, Ukraine. However, their offensives against Leningrad and Moscow have been thwarted by the resolute resistance of the Soviet forces. According to reports from Ankara, Romanian troops, since occupying Bessarabia, feel uneasy and unwilling to continue fighting.

International News Service, Moscow, 3rd: The Red Army High Command acknowledged today that German forces had advanced to a point 45 miles south of Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, but claimed that the German advances toward Moscow and Leningrad had been pushed back in several locations by continuous Soviet counter-attacks.

International News Service, Moscow, 3rd: The Red Army High Command stated yesterday that the German front line was collapsing in key sectors, with large German units suffering repeated Soviet counter-attacks and retreating. Recent Soviet offensives have destroyed four German divisions, and Hitler's army has lost a tenth of its strength due to the Red Army's three-pronged attack. The Red Army is just beginning to demonstrate its power.

Havas News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: Reports indicate that the Southern Red Army attempted to invade Bulgarian territory from northern Dobruja Province to attack the rear of the German-Bulgarian forces but failed.

Reuter's, London, 3rd: Moscow announced last night that a large part of the German 253rd Infantry Division had collapsed following a Soviet counter-attack. However, the location of this collapse was not disclosed. According to Soviet news agency reports from the front, fierce battles raged for four days and nights near a certain town. The German side deployed a large number of supporting troops in an attempt to break the resistance of General Yakovlev's forces, but ultimately failed. The battlefield was littered with the corpses of no fewer than 2,250 German soldiers, and many German soldiers and equipment were captured. According to yesterday's reports, another German infantry division, the 137th, was also defeated by Soviet forces in the Smolensk area. At the beginning of the war, Germany had planned to advance directly to Moscow from Smolensk, triumphantly entering Moscow by August 1st, but this route has now been blocked by Soviet counter-attacks.

Yesterday marked the end of the sixth week of the Soviet-German war. The German side claimed that the German army had not made significant progress on the entire front line from Lake Ladoga to the Black Sea in the past seven days. The Soviet side's midday bulletin stated that on the night of August 1st, fighting continued in the areas of Novosel, Nevel, Smolensk, and Zhytomyr. According to a Soviet bulletin issued a week ago, fierce battles continued in Polotsk, Nevel, Smolensk, and Zhytomyr. Novosel, which was mentioned for the first time this week, is located 50 miles north of Nevel and 100 miles directly south of Pokhov, indicating that the German offensive towards Leningrad has now been contained and stalled approximately 25 miles northeast of Polotsk. The German High Command issues daily reports of "satisfactory progress," and yesterday it stated that the German army in the Ukraine was rapidly advancing deep into the area, "pursuing the retreating enemy." Berlin also stated that a large-scale annihilation battle was underway somewhere 150 miles south of Kyiv, and that several encircled Soviet divisions east of Smolensk were now facing even greater encirclement. Last night, the German official news agency stated that the Soviet counter-attack on the central front (i.e., Smolensk) had failed, resulting in heavy casualties.

End of Sixth Week of War: Soviet Belief in Victory Strengthened

United Press, Moscow, 3rd: Yesterday, there was great confidence here in ultimate victory, as the German-Soviet war entered its sixth week, and the Red Army still held strong defensive positions, while Soviet counter-attacks in several locations were able to repel German advances. This optimism was expressed not only by the press, but also by the highest authorities and the people. Even Harry Hopkins, the U.S. envoy to Britain, shared this view during his talks with Stalin and Molotov. An editorial in Pravda stated that the Red Army had stopped the German offensive and disrupted Hitler's blitzkrieg plan. It also stated that the blitzkrieg failed to prevent the mobilization of Soviet troops, and that the Red Army had crushed the German invasion aimed at occupying Leningrad, Moscow, Kyiv, and other places.

Nazi Invasion of the Soviet Union Suffers Heavy Losses: Ten Panzer Divisions Annihilated

United Press, Moscow, 3rd: An official spokesperson, Lozovsky, gave a concluding statement to the press on the past six weeks of the German-Soviet war, stating that the Red Army had annihilated a large part of the German army, with casualties and prisoners totaling 1.5 million. He claimed, "The German army is being blocked on the eastern front, suffering enormous losses in manpower and material." United Press, London, 3rd: The Soviet Union's claim in the past three weeks to have annihilated ten German panzer divisions is enough to prove the intensity of the war on the entire Soviet front. Military experts here believed yesterday that these huge German losses would halt the previously invincible German advance. Last year, Germany used only two panzer divisions in the historic breakthrough battle during the invasion of France, and the entire panzer force used by the German army last year was two divisions fewer than ten. According to well-informed sources, Germany has a total of 22 panzer divisions available for combat. If ten divisions have been annihilated, it will take considerable time to replenish them. Their touted "third blitzkrieg" against the Soviet Union will certainly not be as powerful as the previous two blitzkriegs. The damage suffered by the Soviet army is enormous, but the Soviet side admits to being satisfied, because the Soviet Union's western reserve forces are gathering quickly, enough to replenish and even exceed the losses. According to rumors, the Soviet army will temporarily refrain from launching a real counter-offensive against the German army until the German army has launched its third blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union and exhausted considerable strength. According to other rumors, the Soviet High Command is currently preserving a powerful reserve force, conserving its strength for future counter-offensives. However, military personnel believe that the Soviet reserve forces are very likely to join the battle during the German army's third blitzkrieg, at which time both sides will be exhausted, and the war will inevitably fall into a stalemate and be prolonged.

German Tank Column Ambushed in Forest: 300 Vehicles Destroyed by Artillery Fire

TASS, Moscow, 3rd: According to a frontline report from Major Anteyev, 300 German tanks recently attempted to break through our front line in a certain area. Our division deliberately retreated, luring the enemy deep into the area, with anti-tank guns and elite infantry ambushed on the left and right flanks, while scouts reconnoitered their movements. At night, the tank column stopped in a forest. Our army considered it an opportunity not to be missed, so it mobilized anti-tank guns and various infantry units for a night attack. The German side panicked and was hardly able to fight back. All 300 tanks were destroyed in the forest fire.

German Convoy in the Baltic Sea Attacked by Soviet Naval and Air Forces

Reuter's, London, 3rd: The Soviet Air Force continues to provide strong support to the ground forces and attack German ships in the Baltic Sea. Its recent achievements include the sinking of one German patrol ship and one 5,000-ton merchant ship, and damage to four others. A Soviet nighttime bulletin stated that the Soviet Navy and Air Force's attacks on German convoys in the Baltic Sea were very effective, saying that Soviet warships and aircraft attacked a German transport ship escorted by five destroyers. According to initial reports, one enemy destroyer and one transport ship were sunk, and two destroyers and one transport ship were damaged. The enemy ships were forced to turn back and could not proceed. The Soviet side suffered no losses. The Soviet Air Force, in conjunction with the ground forces, struck enemy infantry and artillery units. On August 1st, Soviet aircraft destroyed 41 German aircraft, while Soviet aircraft lost 19.

### Duke of Kent Inspects Naval, Land, and Air Stations in Canada, Scheduled to Meet Roosevelt at Month's End

Reuter's, Washington, 3rd: According to White House sources, the Duke of Kent, the younger brother of the King of England, will meet President Roosevelt at Hyde Park on August 23rd, and then accompany the President to Washington. On August 25th, the Duke of Kent will fly to Norfolk, Virginia, to inspect the naval facilities there. That evening, he will fly back to the White House to attend a banquet. The next day, he will visit the naval aircraft factory in Baltimore. The Duke inspected various naval, land, and air stations in Canada yesterday.

### Halifax Broadcasts Speech, Deeply Believes Britain Will Win with US Aid

Reuter's, New York, 3rd: British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax, speaking from Washington on the day the Packard Motor Company began building Rolls-Royce aircraft engines, broadcast to Britain and Canada, saying, "The next few months will be critical, but we are now more certain than ever that ultimate victory belongs to us. With the aid that American industry is now providing, we are confident that we will not only preserve our freedom but also restore the freedom of others. Hitler has now disrupted the world, as Napoleon did a hundred years ago, but Hitler will ultimately fail as Napoleon did." Halifax also spoke of American production efforts, saying that speed is of utmost importance. We have a long way to go to catch up with Germany, but with American assistance, we are now getting closer to our goal. The United States has built a large arsenal within a year to manufacture the necessary weapons to end the war.

### Sir Campbell Arrives in the United States to Take Up His New Post

Reuter's, New York, 3rd: Sir Campbell, the newly appointed British Minister to the United States, arrived here by plane yesterday to take up his new post. When asked by reporters about his thoughts on the issue of US military participation, Campbell replied that the issue was rarely mentioned in Britain, as it was believed that this matter should be decided by you.

### Roosevelt's Envoy Leaves Moscow

Reuter's, Moscow, 3rd: Harry Hopkins, President Roosevelt's envoy, left here yesterday. He arrived in Moscow a few days ago to discuss the issue of American aid to the Soviet Union and held talks with Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov. United Press, Moscow, 3rd: Moscow radio broadcast last night that Harry Hopkins, the U.S. envoy to Britain, had left Moscow. His destination was not specified. British Ambassador Cripps also saw him off at the airport.

### India Purchases Large Quantities of War Materiel, Worth £5.7 Million

Reuter's, Shimla, 3rd: India is currently purchasing large quantities of war materiel. Two procurement agencies of the Indian Supply Department have purchased war materiel worth over £5.7 million. The Punjab police force has donated a large sum of money to purchase six fighter planes to be gifted to the air force.

### Britain Freezes Finnish Funds, Finnish Interests in the UK Managed by Sweden

United Press, London, 3rd: Authoritative sources said yesterday that Britain and Finland have severed relations, and all Finnish assets in Britain have been frozen since the severance of relations.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 3rd: It was officially announced here that Finnish interests in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland are now being managed by Sweden.

### American Firms in Tokyo Resume Business

United Press, Tokyo, 3rd: Many American firms, including Mobil Oil and Citibank, which had suspended operations due to Japan's freezing of American assets, have now reopened. After the mutual freezing of assets between the United States and Japan, Mobil had stopped selling gasoline in Japan due to its inability to pay保证金 and obtain利润. However, with the government's permission to pay保证金, it has continued to sell gasoline. The Citibank branch here has resumed operations after a complete inspection of its books by Japanese officials, but is limited to processing deposits and withdrawals by British, American, and Dutch nationals to pay salaries to Japanese employees and official taxes. American film companies have all agreed to stop releasing films in Japan pending clarification of the freeze order.

### Trade with Japan Stalls: United States Freezes Silk

Reuter's, New York, 3rd: It is widely expected that the production of American silk stockings will soon come to a standstill due to the tension in trade with Japan. Therefore, American women have begun to hoard silk stockings. Two Japanese ships, including the "Tatsuta Maru," unloaded some Japanese silk yesterday on the West Coast. The Production Bureau issued an order in Washington on Friday night banning civilian use of silk, as the current U.S. silk reserves are estimated to be sufficient only for military needs next year. Meanwhile, a Japanese oil tanker is docked in Los Angeles, planning to export 80,000 barrels of gasoline and crude oil. This move will be a test case for U.S. economic restrictions, as it requires a license from the State Department before full payment for the oil can be obtained. At least ten more Japanese oil tankers are waiting along the coast to see what happens. There have been several recent cases of requests to seize goods carried by Japanese ships in U.S. territorial waters, so it is not yet known whether a certain Japanese ship carrying a large amount of silk will sail into San Francisco next week.

### German Technicians Evacuate from Tehran

Reuter's, Ankara, 3rd: Sixty German technicians and industrialists have departed from Tehran, the capital of Iran, heading east. Some of them have already arrived. It is believed that many more Germans will leave Iran after their passports expire soon.

### Eastern Daily News Continues to Advocate Southern Advance

United Press, Tokyo, 3rd: Tokutomi, a commentator for the Mainichi Shimbun, recently wrote an article warning the United States that the current U.S. attitude toward Japan can be compared to the attitude of the Soviet Union in 1903. Japan's tolerance was not unlimited at that time, so Japan finally resorted to force to protect the survival of the nation. He also said, "The U.S. attitude toward Japan is getting worse, and history will repeat itself. Although Japan will not act rashly, it will protect [its] survival when necessary, regardless of the consequences." Tokutomi claimed that the current U.S. attitude toward Japan is ten times worse than the Soviet attitude of that time. Meanwhile, Yamada, chairman of the research department of the "Pacific Society," claimed that the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" that Japan envisions will be a vast area of survival, including China, "Manchukuo," French Indochina, Thailand, Malaya, Burma, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, in addition to Japan. Tokutomi claimed that the goal of the Co-Prosperity Sphere is to liberate Asian nations from military forces from outside Asia, but he acknowledged that this task is very difficult due to the many difficulties encountered in China and the numerous rights and interests that foreign countries have in each other. He stated that Japan will encounter more difficulties in Southeast Asia, as all countries in that region except Thailand are European and American colonies. He also said that the Japanese government's neglect of Southeast Asia as Japan's lifeline is very reprehensible. The Asahi Shimbun published a special dispatch from Saigon stating that Japan's position has been strengthened after increasing its troop deployment to Vietnam. This move by Japan will eliminate the anti-Japanese encirclement by Britain and the United States, and will be very helpful to Japan's southern advance policy in the future. The dispatch also claimed that Vietnam currently has an excess of 50 million koku of white rice, and its proper distribution can solve all the sustenance problems of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." It also said that one of Japan's responsibilities is to save 1 million farmers from the 30,000 anti-Japanese Chinese merchants who are currently monopolizing the distribution of white rice in Vietnam.

### British Aircraft Night Raid on Berlin: Heavy Bombing Unprecedented; Hamburg and Kiel Also Bombed

Reuter's, London, 3rd: According to a recent statement from the Air Ministry, British bombers raided Berlin last night, with bombing of unprecedented intensity, causing large fires in many places. British aircraft also heavily bombed and severely damaged the dockyards of Hamburg and Kiel. Four British aircraft are missing. A British Flying Fortress also dropped bombs over the Kiel dockyards yesterday afternoon during a reconnaissance flight. The enemy was caught off guard and offered no resistance.

Reuter's, London, 3rd: The Air Ministry announced that no enemy aircraft appeared in British skies yesterday. There was some enemy aircraft activity off the east coast. One enemy bomber was shot down into the sea by British aircraft. A 2,000-ton German oil tanker was hit by a British torpedo off Ostend yesterday afternoon, immediately caught fire, and soon sank. One British aircraft is missing.

### High-Ranking German Naval Officer Assassinated in Italy

TASS, Geneva, 3rd: A high-ranking German naval officer was assassinated by an Italian assassination squad near the Italian-Swiss border a few days ago. Many people have been arrested at the Levono Hotel.

### On the European War (VII)(2): The Chief Accountant of the Democratic Front

Today, the nerve center of the world's finance is not on Wall Street in New York, nor on Lombard Street in London, but in a columned building occupying two city blocks to the right of the President's residence on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. This is the United States Treasury Department. The Treasury Department's officials have the arduous task of not only raising funds for the national defense of the country, but also, in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act, maintaining the financial resources of Britain, Canada, and China, as well as all the international dealings of the countries of the Democratic Front. The leader guiding this formidable work is a tall, bald, solemn-faced, fifty-year-old country gentleman, none other than the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. We can well call him the chief accountant of the Democratic Front.

Morgenthau realizes that his job is not just to levy taxes and issue public bonds to open up financial resources for the United States, the "arsenal of democracy." He also has to guard against the crisis of inflation and maintain the connection of the world's monetary systems in order to carry out economic reconstruction after the war.

Morgenthau has an unbreakable faith in capitalism. He says that protecting the petite bourgeoisie is still the best way forward. He believes that the United States can safely pass through this autumn of crisis without developing into an unmanageable inflationary situation. But of all the problems facing the United States today, only one is the most urgent. According to him, "The only task in the world today is to defeat Hitler. This is more important than anything else."

Morgenthau is over six feet tall and has a sturdy build. He generally gives the impression of being calm, prudent, and pragmatic. This impression is further enhanced by his pince-nez glasses and wide forehead. His hair, originally dark brown, is now gray and balding severely. When speaking, he dislikes affectation and rarely gets excited.

Although he is naturally somewhat nervous, prone to annoyance and doubt, most people find him to be self-controlled. He is an astute and organized man who likes his subordinates to present various practical ideas and opinions as the basis for his own decisions. He is consistently honest in handling departmental affairs, wholeheartedly dedicated to his work, and loyally devoted to his old friend President Roosevelt. These are his outstanding qualities, which are praised by both his friends and enemies.

Talking about financial matters is his favorite pastime. At that time, he reverses his usual taciturn attitude, becomes animated, and loses himself in delight. The secret to this treasurer's success is not because of his seniority or the greatness of his character, but simply because of his relentless determination to overcome financial difficulties and supervise himself and his staff. He finally conquered the difficulties he encountered in the early days. At one point, the United States Treasury had just passed through the most serious crisis in its history, and the status of the dollar was precarious. Many experienced financial experts believed that extreme inflation was inevitable, but he urged the Treasury Department to lay the solid foundation it has today.

Outside of the President's Office and the Treasury Department, Morgenthau is not widely popular. He is a thorn in the side of the radical "New Deal" faction, who consider him a reactionary and an obstacle to the implementation of various government spending policies. More conservative colleagues consider him sincere, hardworking, and barely satisfactory. Although people look down on him, his outstanding achievements during his tenure as Secretary of the Treasury are obvious to all. Under his leadership, the position of the dollar has been consolidated and has become the most stable currency in the world. The foundation for economic and monetary cooperation has also been established among democratic countries.

Most finance ministers have spent many years in the financial world, earning a prominent reputation, before being selected. Morgenthau's leap to prominence as a relatively unknown person surprised almost everyone, even himself. He was born in New York fifty years ago. His father, Henry, was originally from Germany and became wealthy in the United States. He served as the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey during President Wilson's era.

This Morgenthau, who serves as the chief accountant of the Democratic Front, clearly did not know what his future held in his childhood. He initially studied civil engineering at Cornell University, but soon dropped out and went to work for his father's company, which he soon abandoned. Later, he recovered from an illness at a ranch in Taizhou, yearned for pastoral life, and decided to become a farmer. He returned to Cornell University to study agriculture and purchased a farm, becoming a full-fledged country gentleman with a scientific mind. It was at this time that Morgenthau and his wife met another country gentleman in the same county, the current President Roosevelt, and became close friends.

When Roosevelt ran for governor of New York, Morgenthau was a pioneer in his campaign. He first went to various states to organize receptions, taking care of everything at the venues so that Roosevelt could take the stage. Then, when Roosevelt was elected governor of New York, Morgenthau was appointed as the New York Commissioner of Materials Storage. In 1933, his old friend Roosevelt was honorably elected as the master of the White House, and he was summoned to the capital to serve as an agricultural advisor and head of the Farm Credit Bureau. It was not until the autumn of 1933 that he entered the Treasury Department as a secretary-general, but in practice he was equivalent to a minister, because the then Secretary of the Treasury, Woodin, was seriously ill and could no longer handle the heavy work. When Woodin passed away, he was promoted to Secretary of the Treasury. (To be continued)

### Restrictions on Shanghai Trade: American Businesses Express Strong Concerns - The Principles of Equal Opportunity Must Be Upheld, and Arbitrary Domination Should Be Eliminated - The Administrative Sovereignty of the Shanghai International Settlement Should Be Transcendent and Independent

Since Japan retaliated against the US and UK freezing Sino-Japanese funds, manipulated Shanghai Customs, and ordered a ban on the shipment of fifteen important commodities to foreign countries (excluding Japan) or free areas of China, the Shanghai trade status, which has continued for a century, has suddenly been shaken. Shanghai has lost its characteristics as an international trade port and has become a victim of pure Japanese nationalism. In particular, the direct blow suffered by British and American businesses is even more severe. According to a well-known American businessman in this city speaking to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, he is extremely dissatisfied with this abnormal situation. The "Open Door Policy," which was almost forgotten, really needs to be reaffirmed at this time, in this place, and under these circumstances.

The Open Door Must Be Maintained

The American businessman said, "In 1899, US President McKinley and Secretary of State John Hay, in view of the competition among various powers for spheres of influence in China, specifically advocated the "Open Door Policy," which was well received by the Chinese government. The essence of this policy has three points: (1) the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, (2) the protection of the legitimate interests of all countries in China, and (3) equal sharing of benefits and equal economic status. These principles are the core of US policy toward China and have not changed for more than forty years. Now, China's territory has been invaded, the interests of various countries in China have been squeezed out, economic rights have been monopolized, and the highest principle of the Open Door has been completely trampled on. We, as Americans, have always strived to safeguard the implementation of this policy.

Resolutely Oppose Breaking the Equilibrium

"Therefore, first, we have always opposed Japan's armed invasion of China's territorial integrity; second, in terms of the current trade situation, we oppose even more Japan's use of military control to deprive third countries of trade rights and monopolize the market. The reason why Shanghai is what it is today is due to the adoption of the Open Door Policy over the years. Free trade has no restrictions, but now this situation has been broken. Third countries are naturally very unwilling. In order to maintain Shanghai's trade from collapsing, we must do our best to keep the Open Door unchanged. If there are any difficulties, they should be overcome by the joint efforts of third countries.

The Holding of Power and Manipulation Cannot Be Allowed to Exist

The basic principles of the Open Door are fixed and unchangeable, but their application should vary with the times. Today, the implementation of this policy must complete the following points: (1) Customs sovereignty should not be controlled by any one party to seek disadvantage to other countries. Tariffs should be treated equally and fairly. Large-scale smuggling to evade customs duties in order to reduce prices and counter other countries should be strictly prohibited. (2) Within the occupied areas, railway freight rates should be the same regardless of nationality. Such things as the suspension of foreign luggage transport by the Japanese authorities in North China should also be prohibited. (3) The administrative sovereignty of the Shanghai International Settlement should be transcendent and independent. All matters must be handled impartially by the joint authorities of the countries concerned. The forces of any one country should never be allowed to manipulate the administrative institutions of the settlement, harming the rights and interests of the people of other countries.

Shanghai's Sovereignty Belongs to China

(4) The legitimate and lawful interests of Chinese merchants in Shanghai should be given the most effective protection by the Shanghai Municipal Council. (5) Inland river navigation should not be controlled solely in the name of military reasons. (6) There should be no restrictions on the quality and quantity of import and export trade. (7) Foreigners should be able to travel freely and in good faith outside the occupied areas. (8) Similar to the North China Post Office stopping receiving or sending foreign postal packages, etc., which contain discriminatory psychology, should be prohibited. (9) Shanghai is an international city with strong neutrality. No matter how the international situation changes, the policies adopted by the countries concerned toward the Shanghai situation must not deviate from this principle. (10) The legitimate Chinese government must be responsible for any changes in Shanghai in order to fulfill its obligations to protect the legitimate interests of all countries. Even if it cannot achieve this goal due to special circumstances, this point cannot be overturned in theory, because we still recognize that the ultimate sovereignty of Shanghai belongs to China.

The United States Insists on Legal Rights and Interests

As for the US attitude toward commercial trade in Shanghai, US Consul General Lockhart in Shanghai made a statement at the beginning of last month, saying that in the long history of US-China commercial relations, the US has never demanded any exclusive or superior commercial status, nor has it ever wanted to restrict the opportunity for other countries to develop trade in China. This fact is well known to the world, but the principle of equal opportunity has been replaced by strict trade restrictions and monopoly, so that the free exchange of goods has been hindered. Unless these restrictions are lifted, there is no hope for a complete restoration of trade. The world is keenly aware of the meaning of fixed trade losses. Friendly trade competitors have disappeared, replaced by severe restrictions. Goods can no longer move freely between Shanghai and the interior. The chaotic situation is becoming more and more serious. In short, what is needed now is to adopt the general principles of free trade to deal with the economic and financial situation. The Open Door Policy must be adhered to in the end to protect Shanghai's trade status and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of foreigners.

### It is rumored that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway track was bombed yesterday morning.

Yesterday, it was rumored that the railway track between Zhouwangmiao and Linping on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was bombed again, so that passengers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway had to get off the train and walk through the section to reach the two places, and then take another train to their destination.

### Fourteen Foreign Banks Safeguard Legitimate Trade, Based on the Principle of Supplying Essential Goods with Drafts

After US President Roosevelt and the British government issued a freeze on Sino-Japanese funds, various British and American commercial banks in Shanghai have received instructions to implement the freeze. According to an economic expert interviewed by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday, the US freezing order is very beneficial to our entire country, and it is not detrimental to Shanghai either. However, some people are worried that if Shanghai cannot purchase foreign exchange, some industries and businesses related to the import and export of goods and raw materials will be in a tragic situation. This is because the content of the special license system proposed by the United States has not been announced. It must be known that the US Treasury Department has granted special notes to the fourteen friendly banks in China to conduct business in China and authorized these banks to invest in various ports in China (except for the four northeastern provinces) and handle imports and exports between the United States, South America, the British Commonwealth, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. In the future, Shanghai's normal foreign imports and exports can be maintained, and there is no need to worry too much.

Lack of Management of Shanghai Prices

Because some people worry that it is difficult to obtain foreign exchange, the prices of imported goods will inevitably rise further, and the prices in Shanghai have been affected and surged. In fact, since the legal currency has a stable image, there seems to be no reason for prices to rise sharply. The current price surge cannot but be attributed to the flooding of hot money and speculators taking advantage of the situation. The financial management regulations of the Ministry of Finance are beyond their capabilities. The prices of goods in Shanghai are inevitably subject to fluctuations due to the failure to manage them strictly. For example, there are as many as 300,000 pieces of cotton yarn in stock, but there are often short squeezes in the market. After the authorities purchased and transported public rice and sold it at a limited price, the rise and fall were relatively small. The effectiveness of price management can be seen here.

Principle of Approved Supply of Drafts

But there is a relationship that can affect the exchange rate and prices, that is, the supply of approved drafts may not be equal to the demand. In this case, the supply of drafts is naturally based on the principle of supplying essential goods first. In the free zone, it can often follow the wishes of the government. However, in the occupied areas, import and export trade must be balanced, otherwise it will be a loss for the stabilization fund. Since Shanghai is a concentration of Chinese and foreign trade, and British and American businesses are of great importance, there is no reason why drafts should not be supplied, and there is no reason to allow them to be naturally loosened and tightened without stability when supplied. If this is the case, then in the future, if import and export trade cannot be balanced, priority should be given to importing essential goods at a stable exchange rate, followed by secondary goods, and unnecessary goods should not be supplied.

### A Salary Increase Dispute Occurred at the French Water and Electricity Company - Uneven Salary Increase Method Opposed by the Labor Side - The French Authorities Scheduled Mediation Talks Today

Since the French Water and Electricity Company increased water and electricity fees and public vehicle fares in the French Concession on August 1, a dispute over the issuance of employee subsidies has occurred. The workers in the company's engine room and ticket sellers, etc., due to the soaring prices, had difficulty maintaining their livelihood, so on the 31st of last month, they sent several representatives to negotiate with the management.

Consideration Results

It was decided to generally increase salaries. Foreign employees will increase by 50% of the total amount of current salaries and allowances, and Chinese employees will only increase by 15%. However, the labor side believes that this salary increase method is unfair, so it refused to accept it. The two sides held different opinions and the situation suddenly became tense. Fortunately, the concession authorities sent personnel to mediate and mediate, so no incidents occurred. However, the labor side has always insisted on a general salary increase.

Should Not Be Overemphasized

The difference between an increase of 50% and an increase of 15% is too large and is not fair. It is heard that this case has been scheduled for mediation talks by the French Concession authorities today to seek a solution. It is also learned that the French Water and Electricity Company has a huge monthly surplus after this price increase. Taking public buses, trams, and trolleybuses as an example, the daily ticket revenue before August 1 was 40,000 yuan. Since the increase of 50%, the daily net income has increased by 20,000 yuan, with a monthly surplus of 600,000 yuan.

### The Resurgence of Rising Prices Must Be Stopped - The Two Authorities Are Carefully Planning

In the past two weeks, the international situation has been unstable, resulting in a flourishing market for various industries. Speculators have actually made a comeback, reselling and raising prices for profit. The prices of various goods have been rising frequently, affecting the livelihoods of ordinary people and the entire social order, which is not insignificant. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency recently learned from the responsible parties of the two concessions that the two authorities have accurate statistics and comparisons of price increases and decreases on a weekly basis, and have sent personnel to various trade associations to investigate the results of price increases and decreases in order to provide evaluation reference materials. Now, due to the actions of speculators, the prices of various goods have stopped falling. The two authorities sincerely hope that merchants and citizens will cooperate as a whole to seek the normalization of Shanghai's entire industry and commerce and the balance of the supply of goods. If there are any manipulations and monopolies who are unwilling to sell the long-held goods at the marked price, citizens can directly report them to the authorities for investigation and prosecution according to law.

### Far East Dutch Ships Sail as Usual - Secret Watch on the Itinerary - The Ship "Tzibad" is scheduled to export next Tuesday - Many Dutch Citizens are Going to the Dutch East Indies via Australia

The Dutch Java Mail Ship Company's "Tzibad" arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, it started loading and unloading cargo at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. In addition to bringing a large amount of Java rice and Dutch sugar this time, there were very few other goods. According to Java Company's news, the ship plans to stay for five days and is scheduled to export next Wednesday. Regarding the issue of not selling tickets for first and second class cabins, an employee of the company said that all cabins have indeed been fully booked, and most of them have been booked by Dutch citizens going to the Dutch East Indies. Although the Dutch Consulate in Shanghai has officially denied that there is an order for Dutch citizens to evacuate, judging from the fact that ship tickets have been fully booked by Dutch citizens, at least some Dutch citizens will soon return to the Dutch East Indies or Australia. According to the company, Java Company has not publicly announced the schedules of various ships in the past. Recently, in view of the tense situation and to adapt to the needs of the environment, the itinerary and arrival and departure dates during the voyage will not be announced until the ships reach their destinations.

### Sandbags Placed in Front of the First Special Court

In order to ensure the safety of the First Special District Court and the temporary office on Weihaiwei Road, and to eliminate various unfounded rumors, the police authorities of the Public Concession have recently placed sandbag bunkers in front of the First Special Court and the temporary office, and sent the American team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to guard them. It is learned that the American team of the Volunteer Corps has been transferred from the American Defense Forces to guard them since yesterday, and a gun vehicle has been stationed near the bunker on Weihaiwei Road for protection.

### Foreign Postal Items were actually Inspected and Detained by the Japanese Side.

According to Dakwang News Agency, foreign sources say that the Japanese side has recently implemented harsh postal inspections in Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other places, paying the most attention to Western postal items, inspecting them one by one, and it is difficult to escape. Various strange propaganda stamps are affixed to the envelopes, and there are even cases of forced detention. The postal items from Shandong and North China to Shanghai have been delayed due to inspection. The British authorities have protested to the Japanese side about this matter.

### Shanghai Pudeh Association News

The Shanghai Pudeh Association at No. 8, Aiwen Zhan Road and Wenzhou Road in this city, is holding a summer free clinic and medicine distribution. The number of people seeking medical treatment is increasing every day, and the medical work is extremely busy. The interest-free small loan business has long been fully booked and closed. It is heard that the association has been allocated 100 bags of crushed wheat, each containing 50 pounds, by the Shanghai branch of the American Red Cross. The association will rush to print coupons for this crushed wheat and distribute them to the poor. Those who are indeed poor can write to the association for wheat tickets.

### Applications for the "Shen Bao" Reader Scholarship Will Close Tomorrow - Luo A Jing and Gong Pei Promote Enthusiasm and Help Students

The "Shen Bao" Reader Scholarship has been accepting applications since the 24th of last month, and it has been 12 days. It will close tomorrow (the 5th) at 6:00 pm. I hope that poor students from all levels of schools who meet the requirements of this newspaper will apply in time and do not miss the deadline. Recently, some applicants have an overall average grade of more than 70 points, but their main subjects are less than 75 points. This situation is difficult to accommodate. Please pay attention. As for those who have already applied, if they have participated in the entrance examination during the summer vacation, whether they are admitted or not, or if they temporarily change schools, they must send a letter to notify us for verification.

Enthusiastic Shop Assistant

Yesterday, Gong Peijun from Futaihao, Pudong Road, Xujiahui, wrote a letter saying, "Dear reporters who organized the scholarship, I would like to pay you my highest respect, because you are the saviors of poor children. I am a grocery store clerk. In my early years, because my family was poor, I came to Shanghai as an apprentice after graduating from elementary school and could not continue my studies. I always regret this. Now, in order to express my sympathy for poor students, I offer a small amount of five yuan and have raised fifteen yuan to show my little appreciation. I hope that our shop assistants will help a little. For example, watching a movie or drinking a glass of wine, don't think that donations are only for the rich. In the future, your children may also benefit one day, what do you think?"

Donating Salary to Help Students

Luo A Jing wrote a letter saying, "Dear reporter, for more than 20 days, I have been constantly reading the news about the scholarship in your newspaper, which has greatly moved me. It turns out that I am also a homeless wanderer who has suffered from the pain of dropping out of school and still wants to make progress (native of Guangdong, 23 years old, both parents have died and there are no brothers). This time, due to my job, I still cannot go to school immediately. Now I will send all my salary of 60 yuan for July to help those in need. Now I have a question and I hope you can answer it for me. I have graduated from junior high school, dropped out of school for five years, and wanted to go to high school, but all subjects have been neglected, and even the certificate has been lost due to fleeing. In this way, can I be allowed to enter high school without taking the exam? I await your reply." (The reporter humbly replies), "It is no problem that entrance to a school requires an exam, and it cannot be accommodated. The Ministry of Education has stipulated that those with a junior high school education can also take the first year of high school with the same academic ability, but the number of admissions is very small. Therefore, even if the certificate is lost, you can still ask the high school you are applying to for an exemption from submitting the certificate."

Yesterday's Donations

Yesterday was a holiday, and there were fewer donations. Luo A Jing donated 60 yuan from his salary in July, Hua Yang donated 20 yuan, Long Peijun donated 5 yuan, Gong Junfu raised 5 yuan from Zhong Zhiliang, Jin Fugen donated 5 yuan, Lin Yichang donated 2 yuan, Chen Jinchun and Qin Baolin jointly donated 3 yuan, totaling 100 yuan. The previous deposit was 18,412 yuan and 6 jiao and 1 fen, totaling 18,512 yuan, 6 jiao, and 1 fen.

### July Price Increases - Cost of Living Index Rises (Continued and Completed)

July Shanghai Worker's Cost of Living Revised Index Base Period: 1936 Average equals 100 (Note) Recently, due to the decrease in the purchasing power of workers in this city, consumption habits have had to change accordingly. For example, cheaper substitutes are used for rice, and only easily available fuels are used. Some foods are even unaffordable. Therefore, the items and quantities used in this index have had to be thoroughly investigated and renamed as the Revised Index. The previous categories of rent and fuel have been combined into a housing category according to recent practice. The assumed minimum living standard has also been revised. It should be noted that this index is compiled for Chinese workers and does not represent the salaried class.

July Shanghai Worker's Actual Income The following figures represent the actual income of the head of the household and other family members, as well as other income in the household. The meaning of actual income refers to wages and all allowances. These figures are based on a study of worker household income distribution and July living expenses. The figures in the table show the cost of two living standards: A is the income that should be available for the revised living standard (to replace the 1936 standard), and B is the income that should be available for the minimum living standard.

### The Dredging Bureau Announces Rainfall Records for This City

This year's rainfall is much greater than last year, especially in June and July. According to the Dredging Bureau's records, the rainfall in this city from January to July this year (in inches) was 2.68 in January, 3.79 in February, 2.26 in March, 2.15 in April, 4.06 in May, 10.08 in June, and 9.25 in July.

American Films Continue to be Shipped to Shanghai - Not Subject to Customs Restrictions

News from North China said that the transportation of American films to other ports has been restricted, causing rumors in this city that new American films will soon be unable to be transported to Shanghai. The reporter asked the Shanghai representatives of various American film companies about this. According to their reply, their offices in North China have encountered difficulties and cannot transport films back to Shanghai or other ports, but there is no shortage of new American films in this city. So far, the transportation of American films to Shanghai has not been restricted by the Jianghai Customs, and it is not expected to encounter difficulties in the future. Well-informed sources believe that the obstruction of the transportation of American films from North China is only a "temporary measure." As for transportation to various ports in the occupied areas, there have been no obstacles.

### Customs Cancels Hanging Signs for Japanese Ships' Arrival and Departure Times

The Japanese side notified Customs yesterday morning that the hanging of signs for Japanese ships entering and leaving the port would be cancelled, except for small ships sailing in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The hanging of signs for Japanese foreign ships entering the port has been stopped since yesterday morning. It is heard that the Pacific liner "Kamakura Maru" (S.S. Kamaknda Maru) of the Japanese Postal Company arrived in port from Japan on Monday and was originally scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on the 5th via Hong Kong to the Philippines. Now the trip to the Philippines has been cancelled, and it will sail to the United States on the 5th. However, whether it will sail to the United States will be decided after hearing the orders of the head office in Kobe. Two American mail ships are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in mid-month, one returning to the United States and one going to the Philippines via Shanghai and Hong Kong.

### If the US Oil Embargo Can Be Thoroughly Implemented, Japan Will Suffer a Fatal Blow - Because Japan's Annual Production is Only One-Tenth of its Consumption, it Has Been Able to Fight Against China for the Past Year Thanks to US Assistance

Since US President Roosevelt announced the freezing of Japanese funds on the 25th of last month, the general public has been very pleased, believing that the US policy of appeasement towards Japan has come to an end. However, knowledgeable people, both Chinese and foreign, in this area believe that the US freezing decree is still very flexible, so they believe that this move only contains a warning to Japan not to engage in further aggression, and it is not really intended to impose sanctions. At the same time, Japan also knows very well that the US has not completely abandoned its appeasement policy, so it still goes its own way, intensifying its southward invasion and threatening and enticing Thailand, so as to use it as a base for attacking the Philippines, Formosa, and the Dutch East Indies in the future. The US authorities have now realized that the policy of appeasement cannot be effective in dealing with Japan, so on the 1st of this month, they ordered a ban on the transportation of machine oil and other materials to foreign countries. Although Japan was not mentioned in the order, it was clearly directed at Japan. Petroleum is the most important raw material in modern warfare. The reason why Germany dared to invade the powerful Soviet Union despite the great wrong was also because of the lack of petroleum, hoping to seize it from the Soviet Union. Moreover, Japan has always relied on other countries for petroleum, especially the United States, which is its greatest weakness in its wartime economy. If the US can thoroughly and strictly implement this embargo, it will be enough to give the Japanese a fatal blow. According to statistics from an economic expert, Japan's annual oil production (including South Sakhalin, Northeast China, and Taiwan) can only meet one-tenth of its consumption. In 1939, the distribution of oil consumption in Japan, according to statistics released by the Japanese side, was 3.4 million tons for civilian use and 2.2 million tons for military use, totaling 5.6 million tons. However, in reality, most of the oil allocated to civilian use was transferred to military use. For example, the reduction in taxi driving and the inability of private cars to purchase gasoline prove that the statistics released by the Japanese side are not accurate and are only intended to conceal their military activities. For more than four years, the reason why Japan has been able to continue fighting in China and maintain its dying life is thanks to the United States, because the military supplies transported from the United States to Japan account for about 60% of Japan's imports, and oil accounts for about 65% of its total exports. The Dutch East Indies also supplies 29%. If the United States resolutely implements this embargo, the Dutch East Indies may follow suit and jointly sanction Japan, and the situation in the Far East can be expected to be clarified soon.

### The Coal Industry Association Cracks Down on Illegal Transactions

The Shanghai Coal Industry Association has always paid close attention to the buying and selling of both large and small companies in the market, and has strongly urged its members to abide by market regulations and not participate in illegal transactions. Those who dare to disobey will be publicly punished. The authorities have further dredged up the source of foreign coal so that it can be gradually transported to Shanghai for regulation and to ensure sufficient reserves.

### Cholera is Rampant in Hongkou - Strict Epidemic Prevention - A Prevention Certificate Must Be Shown to Cross the Bridge

True cholera has now been discovered in this city and is spreading very quickly. Many Japanese people in Zhabei District, Yangshupu, and other places have contracted this acute disease. At about 9:00 am on the 1st of this month, while the Bao Cheng Glass Factory, a Japanese company at No. 706, Heng Hong Road, Zhabei, was in the midst of intense work, suddenly, employees Kumi Yushi (34 years old), Takahashi Raihachi (35 years old), Ichikawa Sutekiro (49 years old), and Sakaki (55 years old) suddenly suffered from severe vomiting and diarrhea, resembling cholera. The factory immediately rushed them to the Bajiaochiao branch of the Tngren Hospital. Kumi and Ichikawa's conditions were particularly bad, and they died one after another on the afternoon of the same day. At about 10:00 am on the 2nd, Yoon Songja, a 32-year-old Korean employee of a Japanese store at the corner of Danyang Road and Qiqihar Road in Yangshupu, also suddenly suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. After medical diagnosis, it was determined to be true cholera. The Japanese military commander, after learning of this, immediately blockaded the two places, and joined forces with the navy, army, police, and local militia to cut off traffic, implement isolation, and disinfect the surrounding areas. Residents must be temporarily vaccinated. Temporary vaccination stations have been set up at the Sichuan Road Bridge, Zha Pu Road Bridge, and Xinzha Bridge, etc., connecting Hongkou and other districts. If it is found that people entering and exiting do not have a certificate of prevention injection, they will be allowed to pass only after they have been injected.

### Songjiang Lei Junyao's Brief Biography - Another Old Friend of Shen Bao Weakens

Mr. Lei Junyao of Songjiang, named Cuo, formerly a Xiaolian (recommended scholar), served as a reporter for Shen Bao for twelve years during the late Qing Dynasty. Last year, his mother celebrated her ninetieth birthday, and Mr. Lei was seventy-one years old. He visited our newspaper once this spring, earnestly inquiring about details. At that time, Mr. Lei was still very energetic. Unexpectedly, Mr. Lei suddenly passed away on June 15th. Colleagues couldn't help but feel deeply saddened. A brief record of Mr. Lei's life events is as follows: Junyao, named Jin, with the alias Dian Gong, later known as Suo'an, was intelligent and studious from a young age. At the age of seventeen, he entered the county school, and at nineteen, he became a provincial graduate. The following year, after failing the spring imperial examination, he stayed in the capital and began to study practical learning. He obtained Xu's "Ying Huan Zhi Lue," Wei's "Hai Guo Tu Zhi," and Li's "Mei Li Jian Kai Guo Bai Nian Ji." After reading these three books, he became extremely interested and paid attention to domestic and foreign current affairs, widely purchasing current affairs books, reading them day and night, and taking notes. A friend visited and, seeing this, asked in surprise, "You don't chant eight-legged essays, but study useless

foreign affairs.

Do you hope to work in the Zongli Yamen (Foreign Affairs Ministry)?" Mr. Lei smiled and changed the subject. In the twenty-third year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, through the introduction of Mr. Zhao Menglin of Qingpu, he joined Shen Bao as an editor and writer, working with Mr. Jin Jianhua. The two got along very well. After the Sino-Japanese War, the weaknesses of our country were exposed, and the powers all had intentions to interfere. However, the court and the public still adhered to old ways and indulged in pleasure without realizing the danger. Even the so-called public opinion organs could not loudly call for change to lead society. At that time, the chief editor, Shi Shiquan, was the strongest opponent of new ideas. Any discussions or records that revealed a slight edge were deleted, only hoping to please the authorities. This was dissatisfactory to society, and sales were also affected. At that time, Zhongwai Daily and Shibao, among others, took the opportunity to rise, full of vitality. Their discussions and records

sought novelty.

In terms of layout, they also made many reforms to meet the needs of the times. After the Reform Movement of 1898 and the Boxer Rebellion, the people's hearts had been suppressed for a long time and longed for change, and there was a great opportunity to try. People's views changed, and they disdained stubborn and outdated newspapers. This was also a necessary trend. Not long after, the manager, Xi Junzipei, decided to reform to reverse the decline. He secretly discussed the reform plan with Mr. Lei and Mr. Jianhua. At that time, Zhang Jun Yunhe had just returned from Japan. Mr. Lei always admired his extensive knowledge and sharp writing, so he strongly invited him to join the newspaper. They planned day and night, setting the key points, keeping everything secret, and not letting Huang know. Once the deployment was complete, they announced the dismissal of Huang Shiquan and replaced him with Mr. Jianhua. The newspaper published on New Year's Day of the thirty-first year of Guangxu had a

greatly different

form and spirit. The first sentence of the commentary quoted the words of Yinbingshi, clearly indicating that it was contrary to Huang's purpose of placing Kang and Liang as rebels when he was in the newspaper. This was also a major commemoration in the history of Shen Bao. After the reform, the newspaper became very popular, sales increased sharply, and it still held the leading position in the newspaper industry. However, the affairs became more complicated, and it was difficult to cope with them. Mr. Lei's physique was originally weak, and he felt deeply unable to support it. Three years later, he resigned and returned to his hometown, having served in Shen Bao for a total of twelve years. Later, Zhang Jun Jingyuan ran the "Shi Shi Xin Bao" and strongly invited him to join the newspaper as the chief writer out of friendship. Four years passed in a hurry, but Mr. Lei was tired of the noise of Shanghai and felt that his weak body was not suitable for staying there for a long time. He decided to retire, entertaining himself with reading and planting flowers. From then on, he severed ties with the newspaper industry. However, when the mood struck, he still occasionally contributed short articles. Mr. Lei had a strong will, thoughtful ideas, and was loyal to ethics, which was beyond the reach of recent people. As for his

love of literature,

studying anecdotes, regarding books as life, and almost innately never putting down a book or stopping writing, it was a daily routine, even more so in his old age. After the August 13th Incident, he sought refuge in Shanghai. His small building was surrounded by books on both sides. He spent his days copying and reading tirelessly. A heart full of depression and sorrow often flowed out in his poems, essays, and diaries. On July 9th of this year, he died of acute pneumonia in his residence on Gordon Road. From the onset of the disease to his death, it only took five days. He had many writings in his life. In addition to the fifty types of books edited and annotated for bookstores and the literary magazines he published, all of which have been printed, his rejected manuscripts include "Yu Xuan Shi Cong Zhu," "Song Cheng," "Xu Xiu Hua Lou Yi Wen Zhi," "San Bai Nian Qian Huo Song Lu," "Si Shu Miao Yu," "Xu Song Jiang Di Zhai Zhi," "Jiu De Lu," "Shang Shi Lu," "Yi Hua," "Rong Cheng Xian Hua," "Gu Jin Wu Jia Kao," "Chan Zu Kao," "Gu Dao Yao," "Wo Sheng Qi Shi Nian," "Lao Hua," and other books. The compilation of "Lao Hua" began in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, collecting thousands of types of books and newspapers, categorized by subject,

becoming a grand view.

It comprised fifty thick volumes, truly an unprecedented masterpiece. Famous people from across the country, hearing of it and requesting to see it, wrote many poems in praise. After the age of seventy, he compiled "Wo Sheng Qi Shi Nian" in three huge volumes, expanding from the individual to the family, to the town, province, country, and the world. All major events were fully recorded, encompassing a wealth of information, making it a valuable reference material for future generations. Unfortunately, after the Sino-Japanese War, there was no evidence of documents. Although he tried his best to search for them, there were still many losses. Mr. Lei once said, "Give me three more years, and I may have the hope of roughly completing the book." This is because the facts in this book must be accurate, and not a single word can be fabricated. His diary began at the age of nineteen, on May 1st of the thirteenth year of Guangxu, and ended at the age of seventy-two, on June 8th of the year Xin Si of the Republic of China, just seven days before his death, spanning fifty-four years. He recorded every day, and each year became a volume. His spirit of handling affairs, not being careless or懈怠, can be seen from this.

### Iron Gates Remain Closed - Nanshi Under Martial Law and Searched - Xinkai River Once Opened Then Closed to Check Household Registration, No Freedom of Movement

The iron gates in Nanshi leading to the French Concession have been closed by the Japanese side in conjunction with the French police since the shooting incident near Wanzhu Street on the 31st of last month. After several days, traffic is still cut off. However, yesterday, the iron gate at Xinkai River was opened several times, but only women and children were allowed to enter and exit, while men were still prohibited from passing. Therefore, yesterday, people were crowded at the iron gates, waiting for the iron gates to open, and some even camped there to wait. Unexpectedly, the result was still not open, which was very disappointing. In the Nanshi area, yesterday, the army was still on high alert in the area of ​​Jiumu Di Fuyou Road Small World, searching door to door. Many citizens were detained and questioned. It is rumored that the Japanese army in Nanshi has agreed with the French police that the iron gates will not be opened until after August 13th.

Checking Household Registration

The iron gates of the French Concession adjacent to Nanshi were still closed yesterday. People whose families were in Nanshi but who were in the concession were all standing at the iron gate, hoping that the iron gate would open. They were still very crowded yesterday. After knowing that there was no hope, they gradually dispersed. Therefore, when the reporter went to patrol in the afternoon, it was already quiet and there was no one there, only the iron gate that was set up but always closed was left. However, it is understood that the closure of the iron gate was at the request of the Japanese side from the French authorities. It is heard that because the Japanese side is conducting household registration in Nanshi, all areas south of the Republic of China Road and east of Fangbang Road, which used to be refugee areas, are prohibited from residents passing through. Therefore, all roads are as quiet as a dead city, and the business of shops is also greatly affected. It is also understood that residents of Nanshi who want to enter the concession must pass through the iron gate of the French Concession. It will take another two or three days before it can be opened. At the same time, it is also learned that if residents of Nanshi want to go to the concession, there is also a way to go, that is, take a ferry from the South Pier to Pudong, and then cross the Pudong to enter the concession.

Prices Soaring

According to a gentleman who went out from Nanshi when it was opened the day before yesterday, he told a reporter from Daguan News Agency that in the afternoon of July 31, another Japanese soldier was killed in front of the gate of Feng Wantong Sauce Garden in Jiumu Di, so the Japanese army implemented emergency alert from the 1st, searching residents, and as of today (2nd), the refugee areas between Luxiangyuan Road, Fangbang Road, Republic of China Road, and Xiaodongmen are densely packed with Japanese soldiers, and residents are not allowed to freely travel back and forth, and because of the frequent shooting incidents, household surveys are being conducted, so when the iron gates will be reopened, it is impossible to find out. All kinds of prices in the city are soaring because of this, and citizens are crying out in misery.

Gambling Dens Closed

According to a news agency report, all gambling dens in Nanshi were limited by the relevant parties to move to the gambling area designated in Jiumu Di from the 1st and pay a donation of 3,000 yuan per day, so the den owners could not maintain it and expressed their unwillingness, so they stopped business on the 1st to show their persistence. It is now learned that the houses of the four gambling dens of Xiyuan, Tongqing, Lubao, and Huamin were closed two days ago and are not allowed to be reopened. Now the den owners are very panicked and have gathered to run around to find a way out.

### Fire at Avenue Edward VII - Fire at Lester School

At about 10:08 last night, a fire broke out without warning in the chemistry room of Lester School at No. 1310 Avenue Edward VII, and it spread instantly. Instruments and other items suffered heavy losses, and the houses were also burned. Later, the fire brigade drove to the scene to put out the fire, and it took two hours to extinguish.

### Summer Clothing

— Jinghua

Summer clothing is worth studying, especially the following points:

1.  Color problem. In summer, it is of course appropriate to use lighter-colored clothing materials, which can resist sunlight by means of reflection. For example, yellow, light yellow, and light blue are more suitable, and white is naturally the best.

2.  Washing problem. Summer clothes need to be washed frequently, so the selected clothing materials must be wear-resistant and washable, and the quality must be solid.

3.  Lining problem. When buying clothing materials, whether or not lining is needed is also a question worth considering. Many smart women know this very well.

4.  Matching problem. In summer clothing, it is not appropriate to match too complicatedly. All sporadic decorations can be removed. In terms of color, it is better not to match too colorfully, which will lose elegance.

5.  Length problem. Summer clothing can be cut shorter, which is both cool and convenient, and can reduce the cost of clothing materials.

### One or Two Things About Summer Living

— Geng

1.  Clean all your furniture once. Anything that is not needed can be put away. This will make the space wider.

2.  Change the light bulbs to sky blue light bulbs, which can emit clear light and give a cool feeling.

3.  Put a white tablecloth on the table and embroider some green flowers, which can make you feel refreshed.

4.  Metal utensils must be kept clean and emit a sparkling light. This can be done by wiping with a solution of hot vinegar and salt, which will surely achieve the desired effect.

5.  Keep some green leaves in a vase.

6.  Add some blue or green colors to the fish tank to make the colors more vivid and pleasing.

7.  Wipe the glass diligently to make it clean and shiny, which can make the vision comfortable invisibly.

8.  Use various scientific equipment to make the body as comfortable as possible.

### Clothing Problems for Underage Children

— Man Yun

The clothing problem for underage children (especially girls) from seven or eight years old to fifteen or sixteen years old is indeed very difficult to solve, because it feels too inactive to wear cheongsams or long gowns for them, and if they wear short clothes, then the style is really a problem. Moreover, children can be divided into two types: thin and tall and short and scattered. The clothes they wear should be changed according to their body shape. Now we can take these two body shapes as the object of discussion.

For thin and tall children: (1) You should make use of the difference between the upper and lower body. You can make Western-style children's clothes for them, which can be divided into the upper and lower body in the middle, so that their body will not appear too long. (2) Emphasize horizontal stripes, and do not nail long rows of buttons on their clothes. (3) Pay attention to their knees, and you can make the clothes longer to cover the knees. (4) Choose clothing materials with body bones. If you wear clothes that are too soft, they will stick to your body and show their thin and tall figure. (5) If it is a girl, do not let her wear high heels.

For short and sturdy children: (1) You can use horizontal stripes, and it is best not to divide the clothes into upper and lower body, but to unify them. (2) Do not wear clothes that are too tight, because after they are too tight, the ugly shape of the body will be completely revealed. (3) Choose soft and thin clothing materials. (4) The color of the clothes can be darker. (5) Tie the waist higher.

### Sleep Problems

— Jing

Among the various tasks of summer living, sleep is extremely important, because if you do not get enough sleep, you will easily become mentally decadent, and sometimes this is the root cause of disease, especially when you are exposed to cold air while sleeping.

Dr. Louiy J. Karnoyh of Cleveland, USA, once conducted a thorough investigation and published the results of his tests in the journal of the American Medical Association, which is worth noting.

Ordinary people generally try their best to count sheep before they can fall asleep, but according to Dr. Karnoyh, this is of no practical use. Reading in bed and doing other brain work such as calculations is also the same, because this method can only make the mind leave sleep and can never promote a state of sleep.

It is not very important for an ordinary healthy person to occasionally have a little insomnia. When you have insomnia, the first thing is to rest your muscles and create a comfortable state, and let your thoughts wander casually. Never concentrate your thoughts on a certain point.

The time between going to bed and falling asleep is very important. At this time, we enter a semi-sleeping state. If there are no sudden thoughts disturbing you at this time, you can fall asleep peacefully.

Ordinary people need eight or nine hours of sleep every night, but some people need more or less, and it cannot be generalized.

### A Week's Home-Cooked Menu

— Ms. Huaying

This year's watermelon prices are no longer comparable to those of the past. Now to buy a pair, you have to pay at least two or three yuan, while in the past you could buy a load. Since the price is so expensive, we should cherish it even more. If you eat watermelon in half, then after you finish eating the pulp, you can put some diced meat, diced ham, cabbage, edamame, fragrant fungus tips, etc. in half of the watermelon peel, mix it with salt, seal it with mulberry paper, put it in a pot and steam it over water until it is transparent. When you eat it, it has the fragrance of watermelon, and its taste is not inferior to winter melon soup. In addition, you can also cut the watermelon peel into small pieces, add edamame and old dried radish to stir-fry, which is very appetizing. If you want something simpler, then you can cut the watermelon peel into thin slices and soak it in good soy sauce, or pickle it with sweet sauce to eat, which is crisp and delicious, and is a wonderful product for serving with porridge.

Monday: Dried fish stewed with pork, vinegar-glazed yellow croaker fillets, sweet sauce fried eggplant, pickled watermelon peel

Tuesday: Onion beef shreds, salted eel stewed with tofu, snow vegetable broad bean soup, scallion radish shreds

Wednesday: Dried vegetable stir-fried pork slices, stir-fried eel shreds with taro, stir-fried green vegetables with bean curd sheets, battered edamame pods

Thursday: Soybean sprouts beef dried scallop egg drop soup, braised cabbage, fried fritters with broad beans

Friday: Wind meat winter melon soup, pan-fried pomfret, shrimp roe stir-fried gluten, stir-fried shepherd's purse

Saturday: Silver bud stir-fried duck shreds, tomato braised pomfret, braised vegetarian ten scenery, jellyfish radish shreds

Summer Clothing and Living Special

### Summer Interior Decoration

— Wan Qiuhong

To know how to make your living comfortable, you only need to ask yourself. Therefore, when decorating your home or judging whether other families are comfortable, you should only ask the people living there. Others cannot decide for them.

In this summer season, if you want to start decorating your home to make your living more comfortable, you can do it according to the methods here:

First, you need to consider the number of people in your family, who they are, and what their needs are. Then, you can decide how to allocate your rooms. This point is relatively easy to achieve. The key is whether all the small items need to be displayed. This can be solved with three questions: (1) Is it practical? If it has lost its usefulness, it should be transformed or repaired. (2) What is the size? Does it take up a lot of space? (3) What about the appearance?

Before officially starting to organize or decorate your house, you should consider the windows, doors, fireplaces, and walls. In the current Shanghai, houses are relatively small, so in the summer, you should try to make the house appear larger, and all daily life can also be more comfortable.

If your room is very low, you can use vertical striped wallpaper, and be sure not to use horizontal stripes, even if it costs money, you can try to avoid it.

To make the windows appear longer, you can use longer curtains and hang them on both sides of the windows. If there are trees or a garden outside the window, you can make the most of this window.

If the color of a room—ceiling, walls, and furniture—is similar, it can appear larger. At the same time, smaller furniture and the use of more mirrors can also achieve the same effect.

Color is a very important issue, especially in summer. It is worthwhile to know the basic principles of color. The basic colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Red and orange, yellow and green, blue and purple can all be harmonious with each other. Red, orange, and yellow are warm colors, suitable for winter. Green, blue, and purple are cold colors and suitable for summer use.

### "Living" in Shanghai in Summer

— Huang

The city is densely populated, and the shops are lined up closely. Since the war, the population has surged, almost tripling. A small house has to accommodate more than a dozen families. Even middle and upper-class families have to accommodate two or three families. Therefore, there are few houses and many people, and the air is polluted. Especially in the hot summer days, the house is so stuffy that you can't even breathe. You sweat all day long, and it's uncomfortable to sit or stand. The only way to remedy this is to take a bath to relieve the heat. However, coal is so expensive, and the hot water for bathing is also a problem. Don't even mention the money. A small house with a coal stove generates dust and raises the temperature inside, which is detrimental to summer hygiene. Yesterday, I visited a friend's house on Yuyuan Road and saw an electric water heater installed in the bathroom, called "Yi Kai Siling," produced by a local electrical appliance manufacturer. The principle is to use electricity to connect to tap water, which circulates through the machine and comes out as boiling water. The machine is easy to use, the water comes out quickly, and you can use cold or hot water as you please. It is also beneficial to summer hygiene. Finally, I have a small suggestion: if the residents of each house can install an electric water heater together, the several families in the house can have an endless supply of hot water. This not only avoids the trouble of using a coal stove but also eliminates the suffering of being steamed by hot air. Therefore, an electric water heater is very beneficial to the general residents. (Editor's note: The machine still has shortcomings to be discussed with the original inventor, because the machine is only limited to use with furnace electricity. Users must have electric heating equipment. If it can be improved to use ordinary current, so that it can be popularized in society, then it is highly anticipated.)

### Common Sense for Choosing Light Bulbs

— Wen

Originally, prices in Shanghai have soared, and ordinary families are all studying how to save money? Especially for electricity, because electricity bills have risen, users' expenses have also increased sharply. Therefore, the common sense of choosing light bulbs and how to obtain true economy are briefly described as follows:

Currently, the top-quality old-brand 40-watt light bulbs sold on the market cost one yuan and thirty-four cents each. The price of cheaper new-brand light bulbs is six or seven cents each. If users are not careful, they think that two cheaper light bulbs can be used as one, which must be cost-effective. In fact, this kind of understanding is completely wrong; because the user's total electricity cost is divided into the cost of the light bulb and the electricity bill, and the cost of the light bulb only accounts for a very small part of the total electricity cost, only about 5%. According to general test results, cheaper new-brand light bulbs emit less light and consume a lot of electricity. Compared with top-quality old-brand light bulbs, the loss in electricity bills is at least 10% or more, and sometimes even as high as 40%. At the current electricity price of 55 cents per kilowatt-hour, using a 40-watt light bulb for 1,000 hours will result in a loss of at least two yuan or more, and sometimes even seven or eight yuan, several times the amount that can be saved on the cost of the light bulb. For users who use more lights, this invisible loss is truly shocking, so if you want to seek true economy, you should start by choosing light bulbs.

Brief News The Hualong Silk and Satin Company at the Xiafei Road Hualong Road tram station has been thriving since its opening. Manager Sun Yifang has a long-term vision, careful planning, and uses strong capital to directly wholesale a large number of silk and satin fabrics, with a full range of colors. Whether it is for making clothing for men, women, old, or young, they are all very suitable, and the selling price is fair.

### American and British Freezes and the Japanese Counter-Freeze

— Wu Shixian

Expansion of the American Freeze Scope

The asset freeze is a type of economic weapon invented by the United States in the current European war, far more severe than the so-called economic severance or economic non-cooperation of the past. Economic severance or so-called economic non-cooperation is limited to severing economic ties between each other, and does not restrain the investment results between each other before the severance. After the severance, the people of the opposing country can still trade with each other in the territory of the country that severs ties, but the asset freeze is different. Although only funds are frozen, funds are the soul of the modern economy, and all economic relations are mediated by it; once the medium is frozen, all relations will naturally be frozen accordingly. Moreover, the scope of the term "funds" is extremely broad. Specifically: it includes cash, checks, bills, gold bullion, silver bullion, bank deposits, public bonds and interest coupons, stocks and dividends, collateral, bills of lading, manufactured goods, commodities, family property, ships and their cargo, land sale contracts, land lease rights, rent, bearer contracts, receipts, account books, commercial contracts, land usage fees, franchise rights, trademark rights, copyright, annuities, and so on. In short, once frozen, all enjoyment and use of real and personal property is not allowed to continue. Before it is unfrozen, it is equivalent to having his property rights completely deprived.

Since the United States began freezing the funds of Norway and Denmark on April 10 of last year, up to the current freeze on the funds of Japan and China, the funds of more than 20 countries in the United States, totaling approximately 6 billion US dollars, have been frozen by the United States. A rough breakdown is as follows (unit: millions of US dollars):

In addition, the funds of Finland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Soviet Union in the United States are also under conditional freezing orders in the United States. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the funds of the Soviet Union were unfrozen.

From the perspective of the purpose and motivation of the freeze, the current freezing policy of the United States can be divided into three categories in nature. The first category has the function of economic sanctions to curb aggression, such as freezing the funds of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The second category has the function of preventing funds from being transferred to the hands of aggressors, such as freezing the funds of Norway, Denmark, and even Chinese funds in the occupied areas of China. The third category has the purpose of promoting the economic policies of friendly countries, such as accepting the request of the Chinese government this time and freezing Chinese funds in the United States, as well as Chinese funds in American commercial banks in the occupied areas of China and areas preparing to fall, such as Shanghai. In addition to preventing them from falling into the hands of aggressors, it also has the function of assisting China in cracking down on speculation and stabilizing the wartime economy.

American, British, and Dutch Freezing of Chinese and Japanese Funds

Since Japan and Vietnam signed the so-called Joint Defense Agreement, the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands almost simultaneously implemented the freezing of Japanese funds on July 25th and 26th. The Dutch East Indies and the United States also prohibited the transportation of oil to Japan on July 18th and August 1st. At the same time as freezing Japanese funds, the three countries unanimously accepted the request of the Chinese government and successively froze Chinese funds. Obviously, freezing Japanese funds is aimed at sanctioning Japan; while freezing Chinese funds is aimed at preventing them from falling into the hands of aggressors, and at the same time assisting the operation of China's wartime economy. The significance is far greater than the previous freezes of other countries by the United States, not only formally expressing the ABCD line's consistent and united attitude towards the Far East issue, but also substantively indicating that the threat posed by Japan to the Far East situation has reached the most serious juncture.

As of now, the detailed measures for freezing Japanese funds by the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands are still unknown. Before implementing the freezing of Japanese funds, it was also necessary to implement an embargo on oil shipments to Japan, which shows that the freezing measures may not be as strict as those for freezing Germany and Italy. Especially on the American side, after the freezing order was issued, Japanese ships in the United States were still able to leave the port, which makes it even more difficult to understand. If under a genuine asset freeze order aimed at sanctions, Japan's trade relations with the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands should not be able to continue. Therefore, Chinese Foreign Minister Guo said in a statement to reporters yesterday, "This measure is like a noose around the neck. But it seems to leave room for execution," so he hopes that the economic noose around Japan's neck will be tightened as quickly as possible for better results.

This time, the United States froze the funds of China and Japan, which was first promulgated by President Roosevelt, formally announcing the freeze. At the same time, a note was issued: one was issued to the islands of Hawaii and the Philippines, allowing them to maintain regular trade relations with China and Japan, and designating banks in each place to handle the supply of such trade remittances. The second was issued to the 14 designated foreign banks in Shanghai, allowing them to maintain legitimate trade between the United States and China. These notes are divided into Nos. 58 and 59. The main points are:

(1) Foreign exchange required for trade in any part of the United States and China (excluding Manchuria) should first be applied for from the designated 14 banks. It must also be a bona fide import and export, and its import and export value must be equal to the amount of foreign exchange applied for. It must also comply with other terms stipulated in this note.

(2) The above trade shall not be operated by blocked countries outside China, or their people (excluding those residing in China), and people residing in Manchuria. And cannot be operated on behalf of these people, and cannot be related to these people.

(3) The above trade shall not contain the interests and property of the above three types of people, unless these people have gone through the application procedures.

(4) People residing in China other than the above three categories, who have been in China since March 14, 1941 and are engaged in business in China, must engage in trade between the United States and any part of China (excluding Manchuria). For the foreign exchange required for their trade, they must apply to the designated 14 banks, and must comply with the above-mentioned terms.

(5) The following 14 banks, designated as American commercial banks: Chase, Citibank, Allied, American Express, and Guaranty Trust; British commercial banks: HSBC, Chartered, Jardine Matheson, New Sassoon, and McCallie; Dutch commercial banks: Amsterdam and Netherlands; and Soviet commercial bank: Moscow Bank, are allowed to operate this type of trade with special notes.

(6) Banks specially approved by the notes are allowed to provide foreign exchange to any part of China (excluding Manchuria) for trade with the United States, the American republics (as stipulated in Note No. 53), the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies.

Based on this, it is not yet known whether there are other freezing mechanisms for all Chinese and Japanese funds in the United States. Even in trade relations with Japan, as well as in various places in China, especially in Shanghai, there is no strict freezing mechanism for all Chinese and Japanese funds. First, the so-called bona fide import and export is abstract; second, all Chinese and foreign people living in China since March 14 this year, including Japanese people, can obtain all American foreign exchange funds as much as possible under the name of so-called "bona fide import and export". However, the more valuable provision stipulates that the foreign exchange applied for should be equal to the total value of its imports and exports; it seems that speculation can be curbed. However, because various banks do not have a special agency for managing trade, this provision is also a mere formality.

As for the British freezing measures, they seem to be stricter. According to the statement of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation: "From July 29, all pound deposits, bonds, and cash in China or branches outside China should be deposited", regardless of Chinese or foreign people, to prevent their movement. The method of review is then used to decide whether to supply funds or not? However, before establishing a strict and complete review system, there are still drawbacks in fact.

Due to the incompleteness of these freezing measures, they cannot prevent the exhaustion of funds, nor can they curb the activities of speculators. If you want it to produce good results, it still needs further action by the British and American authorities.

Genuine Japanese Counter-Freeze

The British and American freezing orders only added a noose to Japan's neck, but did not tighten it. However, Japan has truly buried a counter-freeze network. On the one hand, it has already taken over all the properties of British and Americans in Japan and North China, and at the same time refused to issue travel permits, freezing British and American expatriates traveling to China and Japan in place and unable to move; in addition, it has strengthened control over export trade in the occupied areas. In Shanghai, from August 1st, it has begun to prohibit the export of the following 14 categories of commodities: (1) leather, (2) bran, (3) rice and flour, (4) wheat and flour, (5) pigments, dyes, colorings, paints, and fake paints, (6) vegetable oils and vegetable foods, (7) rubber, (8) coal, (9) cotton and wadding, (10) hemp, jute, and ramie, (11) wool, (12) mineral sands, (13) metals and metal products, (14) chemical products for medicinal and industrial use. Japan does not prohibit imports, but prohibits exports, which seems extremely abrupt. In fact, on the one hand, it reflects the increasing panic of its materials, and on the other hand, it reflects that it is paving the way for swallowing all British and American import drafts and their imported goods in the occupied areas in the future. In the end, everything will be obtained by the Japanese. This makes the so-called British and American freezing of Chinese funds suitable for intercepting China's foreign exchange resources for Japan. From this, it can be seen that if the British and American freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds and their review system are not strict, it will be harmful and not beneficial.

The policy of freezing funds was originally invented by the United States. But now the freezing facilities for Chinese and Japanese funds look like a novice. On the other hand, Japan also implemented its so-called "restriction on foreign transactions" method from the 28th of last month. The established methods are much stricter than those currently implemented by Britain and the United States.

(1) Those designated by the Consul-General as the target, or those designated by the Consul-General, who want to obtain or deal with the rights listed on the left, must be approved by the Consul-General,

(1) When paying public rent and public tax and payment based on this,

(2) Payment of salaries to employees and other workers designated by the Consul-General,

(3) The designation of the Consul-General is not announced.

Bulletin No. 20 said that Notice No. 19 attached on July 28, "Regarding the crackdown on foreign-related transactions", designated as follows: 1. Americans (including US territories and the Commonwealth of the Philippines, the same below), American legal persons, American-affiliated legal persons, and residents in American territory.

According to this regulation, any transaction between a foreigner and a Japanese, or any transaction between a Japanese and any foreign merchant, must first obtain the permission of its consul. Whether to allow it or not? It is determined by the consul-general's preferences. Not only is this the case in transactions, but lending relations and asset transfers, even as small as securities worth 20 yuan, or withdrawals of more than 500 yuan for daily living expenses, cannot be avoided. And in Bulletin No. 20, it is specially pointed out that American public and private legal persons are the main subjects of restriction; which is particularly noteworthy.

Japan's retaliation against the United States, although has been very stern; such regulations have fully grasped the essence of the policy of freezing funds. But it is not commensurate with a country that is as resource-poor as Japan. Because this restriction can at most only achieve the effect of intercepting the assets of foreigners, that is, it cannot close future economic relations; so everything is subject to the permission of the consul-general. The consul-general's decision on whether to allow it or not is naturally based on whether it is in line with the principle of the country's material needs. In other words; a resource-poor country like Japan is only afraid that materials cannot be imported, so the control of trade as a retaliatory measure in the occupied areas of China only prohibits exports and does not ask about imports, and its inner weakness can be imagined. However, if foreigners think that this method does not hinder the development of their Far East trade, they are greatly mistaken. First, those export products that are prohibited in central China today, in addition to some that are urgently needed by free China, another part is military materials that Britain and the United States are eager to need from China. Second, due to the prohibition of export of these commodities, free China will of course no longer carry out its import business in Shanghai, but will find another way. At the same time, merchants who operate the import of these commodities will also stop doing it from now on, otherwise, if they continue to operate this business, it is equivalent to serving the Japanese invasion of China, which is not what the Chinese are willing to do. Third, because Britain and the United States can no longer obtain the export of their important materials here from now on, it is not worthwhile to engage in one-sided imports. Therefore, this kind of export prohibition and the so-called restriction on foreign transactions can only achieve the effect of intercepting assets for a while.

In fact, freezing funds is not only about freezing existing funds, but mainly about abolishing the fund-mediated function in all future economic relations; merely freezing existing funds is limited. In terms of investment relations between the United States, Britain, and Japan: because American and British investment in Japan is greater than Japanese investment in the United States and Britain, it can be said that it is still a loss. But from the point of view that the freezing of funds will completely cut off future economic relations, the interests of the United States and Britain are far greater than those of Japan. This can be seen by looking at Japan's import trade in recent years. In 1938, American goods accounted for 34.4% of Japan's total imports, and British goods accounted for 20.2%. It can be seen that half of Japan's life is controlled by the United States and Britain. If we look at Japan's imported war materials, American goods account for as much as 56.0%, and British goods also account for 20.69%; even the Dutch East Indies and the Netherlands account for 8.62%. In other words: more than 86% of Japan's war materials are supplied by the three countries of the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands. This fact is extremely painful. But if the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands can strictly freeze Japanese funds this time, the collapse of the Japanese economy will not be far away.

### My Opinion on Special Reserve Deposits

— Lu Renyi

At this time of war, prices are soaring, and the number of alliances formed by various industries last year has even exceeded the capital. The amount is so large that it is quite alarming! In general, companies and firms often issue additional dividends in addition to official profits, in order to raise the market price of their stocks and gain social credibility, and the remuneration of employees is even several times higher than the original salary. Although this method does not conflict with the provisions of our country's Company Law (according to the Company Law, if the company has additional surplus, it can issue additional dividends in addition to the dividends after drawing public accumulation). However, the main source of this surplus lies in the increase in the price of inventory, which belongs to a part of unrealized profits and losses, and the dividends and remuneration issued are the most liquid funds, resulting in a reduction in the company's funds due to the relationship of book surplus. And the so-called book surplus inevitably contains virtual value. If prices fall back one day, losses will be inevitable. The impact on the industrial and commercial sectors will be great, and the danger is great. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in view of this, in order to prevent the impact of price fluctuations and seek to consolidate the foundation of industry and commerce, has promulgated the Measures for the Deposit of Special Reserves by Companies in Extraordinary Times; stipulating that when each industrial and commercial company has a surplus at the end of each business year, it shall deposit a special reserve in addition to the public accumulation in accordance with the law. Those whose surplus is more than one-fifth of the total actual capital shall deposit 10% of the surplus. Those who are more than one-quarter of the surplus shall deposit 20% of the surplus. Those who are more than one-third of the surplus shall deposit 20% of the special reserve uniformly. It is also stipulated that the reserve must be stored in a bank with special funds to ensure security. It has been circulated to the competent authorities, and each company has been specially ordered to strictly follow it from this year. This method is purely designed to protect the industrial and commercial sectors, and is sufficient to consolidate credibility, encourage investment, and generally, the industrial and commercial sectors that operate steadily, in order to avoid shareholders demanding the distribution of additional dividends and deposit illegal secret public accumulation, can be brought back to the right track in the future and change to deposit special reserves in accordance with the law! Therefore, the promulgation of this method is of great benefit to the industrial and commercial sectors, which is enough to show the government's sincerity to the industrial and commercial sectors. Each company should strictly comply with it for the sake of private and public interests, and should not have any further objections. However, as far as my personal opinion is concerned, there are still some things that need to be discussed in this method, that is, the nature of the business operated by each industry is different. The responsibilities they bear to society are also of great importance, so it seems inappropriate to handle the deposit of special reserves uniformly. For example, companies that operate banks, trusts, and insurance, which are more responsible to society, in this extraordinary period, due to the relationship of floating funds, deposits have increased suddenly. Deposit interest rates have decreased. And with the development of business, both lending and investment can obtain generous profits. If the war ends in the future, the economy will decline. The crisis is great. Because of the importance of its responsibilities, the proportion of deposits and special reserves should be appropriately increased. For companies whose trade is operated and whose prices are extremely easy to rise and fall, such as those who operate rice, wheat, and food, once the war stops, the price will inevitably fall back sharply, and special reserves should also be increased to ensure stability. As for how to stipulate the proportion! How should the nature of each industry be divided! I deeply hope that domestic accounting scholars will study and propose opinions for the government to refer to, so that this regulation can be more perfect, and I believe that it will also be happily adopted by government legislators. The purpose of drafting this article is to provide some personal opinions, and in addition, I hope that the industrial and commercial sectors will work hard to promote the deposit of special reserves.

Commercial News

### American Cotton Surges; Indian Cotton Forward White Lot Sees a Small Decrease

The New York cotton market was active and firm, with the public buying in, coupled with bad weather, and the Washington news revised the price control regulations and rose. As a result of the closing, the price rose sharply by 72 to 81 points per pound compared with the previous day.

The Bombay cotton market fell at first due to exports selling out, then rose slightly due to bulls buying in, and finally fell again due to old bulls closing out. As a result of the closing, the price rose by 2 to 4 rupees compared with the previous day, with the exception of the forward white lot, which saw a small decrease of 0.025.

### Factory Side Has Goods Distributed; Soap Sales Clear, Prices Tired; Matches and Foreign Candles Also See a Small Rebound

The daily necessities market conditions were stimulated by the financial turmoil last week and once soared sharply. At present, people's hearts are slightly calmer, because the factory side continues to have goods to distribute, the raw materials will not be interrupted for the time being, and the actual sales are light, and the hoarding wind has decreased compared with before, resulting in a peaceful trend in the market. It is estimated that each box of Guben soap is 53.5 yuan, Baixiangmao soap is 43 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap is 41.5 yuan, Arrow Knife soap is 44 yuan, Meili brand matches are 780 yuan per box, Phoenix brand is 705 yuan, and sailboat brand foreign candles are 33.5 yuan.

### Kaiping Dross Soars; Breaks This Year's Highest Record

Kaiping smoke dross has been stable for several months. After the lump coal rose high at the beginning of last week, this street continued to absorb coal dross. However, due to the long-term scarcity of sources and the weakness of the inventory, the market sentiment was stimulated and the market soared. The initial price of No. 2 dross was 330 yuan in the evening, and then the market opened at 360 yuan due to the continuous digging and absorption by street customers, breaking this year's highest record. It is estimated that it has risen by 40 yuan this week.

Galangal Market Soft

Some galangal has been transferred from Hong Kong recently. The number of market stocks is not large. Because the current sales order has passed, the trend has turned soft. The high-end price of the goods is 70 yuan to 65 yuan, and the ordinary price is 55 to 56 yuan. There are few recipients, but because the stock is thin, there is no excessive slackening.

### Sugarcane and Cane Sugar (2)

(China Section) Gao Jiannong

When did Chinese people first know about cane sugar? I think the earliest we can trace it back to is the end of the first century or the beginning of the second century AD. Because Zhang Heng, a great composer and astronomer of the Eastern Han Dynasty—born in 78 AD and died in 139 AD—first used the phrase "sand candy, not honey, tributes from afar" in his work "Seven Debates." Before this, there is no record of it. In the middle of the third century, Sun Liang, the emperor of the Wu Kingdom, left a good story about cane sugar. According to the "Jiang Biao Zhuan" in the "Annotations to the Records of the Three Kingdoms": "Sun Liang sent a eunuch with a silver bowl and lid to take 'sugar cane syrup' presented by Jiaozhou from a hidden official. The eunuch hated the hidden official and threw rat droppings into the syrup, reporting that the official was not careful. Liang called the official to bring the syrup container and asked, 'This container is covered, how could this happen? If the droppings were in the syrup, they should be wet, but now they are dry! Eunuch, are you framing him?' The official kowtowed and said, 'I asked for a mat from so-and-so, there were only a few, I didn't dare to give it.' Liang said, 'It must be this!' He re-questioned the eunuch, who confessed everything." Judging from Zhang Heng's words, "sand candy, not honey" was already real sugar, and it was extremely clear. According to the "Jiang Biao Zhuan," it seems that "sugar cane syrup" was only a kind of wet syrup. Roughly speaking, the cane sugar imported into China from "distant Jiaozhou" at that time could be divided into these two states. Looking at what Ji Han of the Jin Dynasty said later in his "Southern Plants and Trees": "Sugarcane... its juice is squeezed out, and it becomes syrup after a few days in the sun, melting in the mouth, which people there call 'stone honey'..." and the words of the "Records of Strange Things" quoted by Jia Sixie of the Later Wei Dynasty in his "Essential Techniques for the Welfare of the People": "Sugarcane... that produced in Jiaozhi is particularly pure and good... the squeezed juice is like syrup, and when solidified it is called 'sugar', which is even more precious—this is the first appearance of the character 'sugar'—it is also fried and dried in the sun, congealing into ice and breaking like bricks; eating it melts in the mouth, and people at that time called it 'stone honey'..." only the "stone honey" like ice and bricks is mentioned, and there is no trace of the liquid "sugar cane syrup"; or by this time, the technology of making cane sugar had greatly improved, around the time of Jia Sixie, and perhaps Persians had already understood cane sugar, and the original syrupy thing was eliminated.

I don't know why, but whenever the words "stone honey" are mentioned, people immediately think of the clean, white, crystal-clear, and hard "rock candy." What kind of sugar does "stone honey" actually refer to? Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty said in his "Compendium of Materia Medica": "According to Wan Zhen—a person of the Tang Dynasty—in his 'Records of Strange Things of Liangzhou,' 'Stone honey is not a stone, it only borrows the name of a stone; it is actually sugarcane juice, fried and dried in the sun, and it congeals like a stone, but its body is very light, so it is called stone honey'..." Li Shizhen himself said: "Stone honey is white granulated sugar; that which congeals into cakes like stones is called 'stone honey,' that which is light and white like frost is called 'sugar frost,' and that which is firm and white like ice is called 'rock candy,' all are different in fineness. "I think that initially, "stone honey" only referred to the brown, coarse granulated sugar. This is proven by the previously described development process of cane sugar, which is not arbitrary. Later, white granulated sugar and rock candy were refined one after another, and the ancients still used the name "stone honey" for them without making detailed distinctions. Therefore, stone honey can include the above three kinds of things and cannot be said to refer only to white granulated sugar. As for "sugar frost," it is only a synonym for granulated sugar, and it is difficult to determine that it specifically refers to the kind of sugar that is "light and white like frost" (the reason is given later); only the later term "rock candy" has a clear meaning and can represent the characteristics of the actual thing!

Spring and Autumn

Going out against the flow, going in against the flow

### Fluctuation

— Wu Jin

The wife is anxious, the husband is happy.

"X jins..." "X yuan X jiao..." "It's terrible!..." A mixed noise started downstairs.

After a while, Wang Ma ran upstairs from downstairs: "Madam, soybean oil has reached two yuan. The landlord just bought ten jins."

"How is it so fast?" Madam asked in surprise.

"Pour the oil from the oil bottle, and I'll hurry to buy it... Alas, there is no spare money at home. Please buy eight jins for me first!" She took out four five-yuan bills and gave them to Wang Ma, and said: "Buy some more soap and toilet paper with the remaining money... Hurry!"

Before long, the sound of oil bottles colliding went down the stairs.

"Wang Ma, are you also going to buy oil? I'm afraid it has risen again!" This was the voice of the landlord's wife.

Wang Ma responded with a sound of "Um!" and

ran to the oil shop in one breath. "Hey! Buy soybean oil!"

"How much?" A shop assistant asked.

"Eight jins."

"Eight jins? Two yuan and five jiao a jin."

"What? Didn't someone just buy it for two yuan? Just now!..."

"Who told you not to come just now? It has risen now!" The shop assistant became impatient.

She thought for a while and said: "It has risen now? How is it so fast?... If I had come just now, wouldn't you have sold it to me already? We are old customers, there is no reason to be late!"

"Don't be long-winded! Now is now's price!" Another shop assistant interjected.

Wang Ma was stunned for a moment and finally returned with the empty bottles.

"Madam! The oil has risen another five jiao, two yuan and five jiao. I didn't buy it."

"Ah... Why didn't you buy it?" Madam asked anxiously.

"How can I decide this! You will say I am earning money again."

"Stop talking nonsense, when have I ever wronged you? If you don't buy it now, it will rise again soon?... Where is the soap? Why did you only buy two pieces? Why are there only two stacks of toilet paper?" Madam became even more anxious.

"Both items have risen four cents..."

"Stop talking nonsense! Go again, go again, hurry!"

Wang Ma reluctantly walked to the oil shop again, and only one door was open. She ran in bashfully.

"You are really ruthless, sell it to me at the price! Eight jins,"

A shop assistant stood up with a smile, as if he was about to do business.

A pot-bellied gentleman lying on the account table knew about it and shouted: "Closed! Come tomorrow!"

"It's only after eight o'clock, why are you closing so early today?" She knew it was not closing time yet.

"Foreigner, who told you not to buy it just now... Come tomorrow!" The shop assistant said lightly.

"Will it rise again tomorrow?"

"Blame yourself!"

She ran to several small shops, but they were all closed, so she had to take the empty bottles back again.

"Alas! I don't know how much it will rise tomorrow?... I told you to buy it, but you didn't, I don't know how many tricks!... Madam was blaming Wang Ma, when the husband came in with the sound of leather shoes. While taking off his hat, he exclaimed, "Do you know: everything is rising sharply!... It's terrible!"

"Yes," Madam interjected, "I told her to buy more soybean oil, but she..."

"Soybean oil?" The husband interjected again: "I bought a dozen boxes of soap, still at the old price... They will be delivered immediately!"

"What do you need so much for? Why don't you buy something else?"

The husband laughed: "You put it well! I bought so much for you to use, right? It was difficult for me to get it from others, and the money hasn't been paid yet... Now is a good opportunity!..."

"Is the soap upstairs?" Someone downstairs was asking.

"Yes, yes," the husband answered brightly.

Then there was a heavy sound of footsteps and the shouts of porters on the stairs!

"Thump... thump... thump..." "Ugh! ... Ugh! ... Ugh! ..."

A certain cigarette and paper shop at the intersection of Guling Road and Changsha Road has a notice hanging at the door, which is quite novel and subtle, so I respectfully transcribe it as follows:

"Matches are expensive, if you don't buy cigarettes, don't bother to open your mouth. - Know your place"

Not only is it not found in the "Advertising Encyclopedia", but also the arrogant attitude of hoarding tigers is vividly depicted.

### Please Save the Teachers Again

— Jian Song

The facts are all there, not just shocking rumors!

Yesterday, I ran into a friend who is an elementary school teacher. Speaking of his suffering, it is simply unbelievable:

His monthly salary is forty yuan, and his family has five members including his wife, children, and mother. They live in a two-story loft, with a monthly rent of ten yuan (still the old price). They eat six dou of rice, which costs sixty-six yuan if each dou is counted at eleven yuan of Hong Kong rice. The food, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, firewood, clothing, etc., are extremely frugal, and they have to run a deficit of about one hundred yuan per month, but there is no way to borrow money. His wife has children and cannot go out to work, so he lives like a year, and every day is like New Year's Eve.

He said that he sometimes wanted to commit suicide, but he couldn't abandon his family. Sometimes he wanted to leave, but that would be the same, what would they do! So he is always worried. Alas, it's really terrible. The poorer he is, the more likely he is to get sick. He can't even afford a quick meal, so where does the "medical expenses" come from? He can only "endure" and fight against the disease.

But people always love to live. He now only wants another job—a career change.

However, he said, I studied in a normal school, what should I do? I am not familiar with people, and there is really no way to go to heaven or earth. Later, he finally found a night school, with a monthly salary of thirty yuan, and a student hired him as a private tutor, with twenty yuan per month, and also provided a dinner. Sometimes, his wife helps people wash clothes to supplement the family. In this way, he said, he can barely get by with hard work.

Who knew that the good times would not last long, and the summer vacation came. He thought he could earn some hard-earned money, but the principal deducted two months' salary from them, and the unexpected "misfortune" caused him to be sleepless for three whole nights. The principal was forcing people to their deaths. Therefore, he said, now a friend has introduced him to be a bookkeeper in a company, with a monthly salary of ninety yuan, plus about twenty yuan of "extra income." He has been doing it for a month now and feels it is not bad, so he is determined not to be a teacher anymore. Moreover, he also said that he doesn't know how many teachers are in the same situation as him. The most painful thing, he said, is that a colleague of his couldn't live on, and had no choice but to sell his fourteen-year-old daughter for seven hundred yuan to make a living, which made my hair stand on end, and I couldn't open my mouth for a long time.

After listening to this, I couldn't even believe that what I heard was a true story, and I didn't understand that I would grow up in such a society. But this is a definite fact, and who can deny it?

This made my heart tremble so much that I worried about the future of society—isn't the education of children being ruined? Aren't teachers all going to be strangled? If this goes on, who would want to be a teacher? We cannot sit idly by and watch this crisis. We must stand up and appeal again, and ask people from all walks of life to pay attention to this serious problem.

The government's relief funds also hope to target this group of truly poor teachers, and implement a fair method of "granting funds according to the number of family members." Before the grant, a detailed investigation must be carried out, so that the true faces of the villains will be revealed!

This event is too serious, we can no longer remain silent. Sit idly by!

A: Miss Tang sent me a handkerchief; what do you think she means?

B: This is probably prepared for you to wipe away tears when you are heartbroken.

Absurd person: What are the methods to solve the current life problems?

Rational person: You should look for stimulation.

Absurd person: This...

Rational person: Because stimulation can strengthen your courage to struggle for life. Customer: (Holding a powder) Is there anything better?

Clerk: This price is more than my monthly salary! (But rewards)

Eleven Midnight Song

He had almost forgotten that the person standing in front of him would be his own daughter. He reached out and grabbed a clay teapot from the table and slammed it hard on the ground. Because he had used all his strength to slam it, the broken tiles bounced off the ground, and several pieces flew straight to Mei Bao's body. "Isn't our suffering enough? Don't you want me to watch you grow up and then die? Tell me, who gave you this idea? Speak up! Why don't you speak up?"

Mei Bao had been growing for fifteen years, and today was the first time she had been scolded by her father, and what made her most confused was why her father would get so angry when singing opera was mentioned.

"Are those photos and letters I saw all fake?" She was almost terrified. She thought that if her father had really been an opera singer before, why would he be so annoyed now?

However, Qiu Haitang's brain nerves had entered a semi-crazy state due to being unable to withstand the stimulation. Even though Mei Bao was trembling with fear, his anger was still simmering in his heart.

"Why don't you speak up when I ask you?" He slammed a white wooden table in front of him, making a deafening sound. "Okay, even if you don't say it, I know! It must be the daughter-in-law of the Meng shopkeeper who is causing trouble! I will fight them to the death!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he strode out. (175)
