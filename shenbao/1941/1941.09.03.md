### President Roosevelt Clearly States: Aid to China and the Soviet Union Policies Remain Unchanged, Vows to Never Compromise with Nazism, and Leaves Room for Mediation in the Far Eastern Situation

Reuters, Washington, 2nd: President Roosevelt's broadcast address yesterday (full text in a separate dispatch), although it did not disclose any new policies or new steps in its existing policies, was welcomed by those who support participation in the war. The president's firm declaration that he would not beg for scraps from Hitler's victories and the Nazi war machine, that the United States should redouble its efforts as Soviet resistance is now slowing down, and that the United States must defeat Germany if it wishes to continue enjoying its existing rights, were all satisfactory to listeners. However, some regret that the president did not state the future direction in clearer terms. It is widely believed that the purpose of this speech is to prepare Americans to give up many of their benefits in order to increase the production of war materials. The president's statement that American soldiers are now being transported to various battlefields every day is a welcome indication that the United States' policy of aiding China and the Soviet Union has not changed and that Washington does not want to appease Japan.

United Press, Washington, 2nd: President Roosevelt did not specifically mention Japan in his Labor Day speech. Yesterday, it was widely believed that this was to leave room for mediation in the Far Eastern situation. At the same time, well-informed sources pointed out that President Roosevelt's renewed warning that there can be no compromise with aggressors implied that the United States will continue to adopt a firm stance in any negotiations with Japan. This warning is widely regarded as a reassurance to China and the Soviet Union that their position in the world's resistance to aggressors will not be harmed if a peaceful solution is reached to the US-Japan pending issues. President Roosevelt called on the country to increase arms production and provide greater guarantees for the full transportation of war materials. This is seen as a warning to Japan that the United States will continue to aid China, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

Reuters, New York, 2nd: Newspapers here all say that President Roosevelt's Labor Day speech was a call to defeat Hitler. The impression in the United States is far more profound than any statement made by President Roosevelt after the Atlantic Conference. The "New York Daily News" called it a personal declaration of war against Hitler. The "New York Times" said that although we have not yet declared war or directly participated in a real war, the position we have adopted will force us to finally take this direct participation when the current policy proves insufficient to defeat Hitler. Most Americans are unwilling to retreat from this position. Some commentators believe that the failure to mention Japan in the speech may indicate that the door to a solution remains open.

### Full Text of Roosevelt's Speech

Reuters, New York, 2nd: President Roosevelt's Labor Day speech in the United States did not specifically explain everything, nor did it say that the United States should participate in the war again, but it was a step further than previous public speeches, and guaranteed that the United States would do its best to conquer Hitlerism. The original text of his speech is as follows:

Resolve to Uphold Democracy and Fight for Freedom

Today is an American holiday. We celebrate the rights of free men and women workers. The preservation of these rights is of utmost importance at present, not only for those of us who enjoy these rights, but also for the entire future of Christian civilization. American labor now bears the great responsibility of winning victory in this most barbaric and terrible war. Our factories and workshops are now manufacturing large quantities of war materials on a large scale. These war materials are now being transported by sea and air to various battlefields around the world, and the United States is planning and developing new weapons with unprecedented power in order to maintain democracy. Why are we doing this? Why are we determined to devote our entire industrial efforts to a war that has not touched our territory? We do not seek national glory, we have no interest in aggression, we do not pay attention to the plundering of dictators, and we do not covet an inch of land in any other country. Our great efforts and consistent purpose are due to our recognition that our basic rights—including labor rights—have been threatened by Hitler's violent attempt to rule the world. The British Navy and the fleets of the Netherlands, Norway, and the United States exist for a long time, and the United States Navy will be able to jointly protect maritime freedom. The enemy who seeks to shatter American freedom already knows this, and knows that if the navies of other countries are destroyed, the United States Navy, whether now or in the future, will never be able to maintain maritime freedom to confront an enemy whose power extends to all other countries in the world.

Accelerate Production to Destroy Nazism

The enemy further knows that American production has made great progress last year, and that its products are now being shipped to various battlefields against Hitlerism in increasing numbers every day, but the enemy also knows that American efforts are not yet sufficient. If we do not catch up quickly, increase our production, and protect our products more extensively to reach the front lines safely, the enemy will definitely dare to advance its attacks on new and old battlefields. Anyone who thinks that Hitler has been blocked and stopped, I give a solemn warning that this is a very dangerous speculation. When the enemy's progress is slower than it was a year ago, it is time to strike with twice the strength, so as to eliminate the harm of conquering the world once and for all, and to eradicate the words and thoughts of establishing peace on appeasement. We all know that the free labor system is the foundation of a vibrant democracy. We also know that one of the first actions of the Axis dictators is to sweep away the various principles and standards that labor has established to seek its own maintenance and progress. Therefore, trade unionism is not allowed by dictators, because trade unionism requires complete freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Trade unionism has helped workers in various countries to obtain the dignity they deserve. The current position of American labor, as a unit of mutual maintenance in national life, is not obtained by accident, but is an evolutionary process in the steady development of democracy. Hitler does not want this, he cannot do it, and he will not do it. Since he exploits individual rights, he will certainly not recognize group rights, whether they are labor, business, academia, or religion. He has abolished trade unions, just as he has destroyed religion. American groups are more aware of what Nazi rule means to their living standards, their freedom, and their lives than organized labor, and the group that bears the greatest responsibility in defeating Nazism, maintaining basic freedom, and preserving world democracy is labor.

Warning to the Appeasers: Treason is Despised

We have already achieved a lot, and now we urgently need to achieve more. The length of the suffering that mankind has experienced will be determined by the dedication and sacrifice of our production of weapons to fight for freedom. Therefore, we cannot hesitate about the great work before us, and we must regard the defense of American freedom as higher than all private purposes and interests. We are now engaged in great and dangerous work. Hitler has unleashed violent forces on the world, and we must do our best to subdue them, otherwise these forces will inevitably be applied to us when we handle our own affairs to protect our legitimate interests. The work of defeating Hitler may take a long time and will not be easy. There are a few appeasers and Nazi sympathizers who think it is impossible and ask me to negotiate with Hitler and beg for scraps from the victor. They want me to become a modern-day Arnold (a traitor during the American Revolution in the late 18th century) and betray the freedom, religion, and country that I cherish. I have refused and will refuse again and again, and when I say that we will do everything we can to destroy Hitler and the Nazi forces, I know that I am speaking on behalf of the conscience and determination of the American people. American workers, farmers, businessmen, and people from all walks of life now bear the great responsibility and right to create a democratic world on a lasting foundation. I hope that in the coming years, the American president will be able to say on future Labor Days that we have faithfully fulfilled our responsibilities.

### Britain and Australia Welcome

Reuters, London, 2nd: President Roosevelt's Labor Day speech was difficult to hear in Europe due to adverse weather conditions, but shortwave radio listeners in London heard most of the speech. President Roosevelt's speech was calm and detailed, and his tone of voice, which mentioned the Nazi threat to labor standards around the world, revealed his calm belief, which was quite moving to listeners. The speech lasted fifteen minutes, and at the end, the military band played the American song.

Reuters, London, 2nd: Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that President Roosevelt's realistic tone and his warning not to underestimate the current crisis were approved by London. In recent weeks, British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden have issued warnings not to underestimate the enemy. Now the US President has quickly responded and spoken sincerely. The determination of the United States to increase the production of war materials to the maximum extent is welcomed here. President Roosevelt's expression of this determination shows that he clearly knows the urgent need for supplies, and Londoners are certainly pleased with this.

Reuters, Canberra, 2nd: Australian Prime Minister Fadden commented on President Roosevelt's speech, saying that this speech produced two significant phenomena: (1) warning against complacency due to the apparent slowness of the German war machine, and (2) resolutely condemning any proposals to make peace with Hitler. This is the final fatal blow to the Axis powers' hope that the United States is not prepared to support the democratic countries to the end.

### Eastern Newspaper's Coldly Sarcastic Remarks

Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd: The Japanese "Kochi Jihō" published an article yesterday commenting on President Roosevelt's statement that "We are not a warlike people, we do not engage in aggression," saying that there are those who use the military for aggression and those who do not use the military. Since the US government occupied the Philippine Islands by force, it has been engaged in aggression in the Far East, and has exerted political pressure on third countries under the guise of stability to maintain the war in China. Its State Council interferes in the affairs between countries in the Far East. It should be known that the punitive power of economic weapons is no less than that of the navy and army. The United States' illusion of a Far Eastern political empire is to incite alliances to build fortifications, implement boycotts and blockades, and supply war materials to one side while prohibiting them from being transported to the other side, in order to achieve its hegemony. All of this is American aggression. In the past, President Washington's policy was to be less involved in foreign disputes and to focus on the country's land. In recent years, the US government has abandoned this statesmanlike demeanor. In fact, its policy is not for the benefit of the democratic allied countries.

Editorial

### Review of the German-Soviet War

The German-Soviet war has been going on for eleven weeks. The German army is advancing on both the north and south routes. In reality, the third offensive in Ukraine is the focus, and in recent days, it has clearly shown signs of decline and stagnation. The struggle on the Dnieper River and near Leningrad has entered a state of seesaw warfare. If Germany wants to try to advance further, it must make great sacrifices and efforts to launch a fourth large-scale offensive. This means that it must add more than a million fresh troops, thousands of aircraft and tanks, and throw them into a more intense bloody battle. Whether Germany can allow itself to do this is certainly a relatively important question; but Hitler, in his entire strategy, must give deep and serious consideration to whether the present timing is appropriate.

Germany's blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union initially adopted a very fierce posture. After the Soviet Union's resolute resistance, it soon showed signs of decline. This was the first offensive. As a result of this period, the Soviet Union retreated on the entire front line, and the main force of the Red Army in front and the rear reinforcements were mobilized and concentrated within the old borders before September 1939. After a short period of stalemate, Germany added fresh troops and launched a second major offensive. The biggest gain for Germany this time was the occupation of Minsk, Smolensk, and other important places in the middle route. However, under unprecedented human and material losses, Germany's offensive soon entered a state of stagnation again. Therefore, in order to thoroughly achieve its war goals, Germany had no choice but to make more sacrifices, which is the third offensive that is now gradually stagnating. This is the largest-scale battle in history! According to Churchill, the military forces used by both sides have totaled six million people, and the official statistics released by the Soviet Union claim that German casualties have reached two million, and the losses of aircraft and tanks have each exceeded five thousand. However, reviewing the course of the battle for these eleven weeks, in addition to occupying some land, Germany's achievements in both strategic and tactical aspects can be said to be completely zero. Several encirclements, intrusions, and pincer movements have failed to repeat the story of the complete capture of the French Maginot Line garrison or the surrender of the entire Belgian army. And even after Odessa was cut off, the Dunkirk-style retreat predicted by the German side has not yet been able to appear. But on the contrary, the Soviet Union's isolated defense of Odessa, the launching of rear guerrilla warfare in the German-occupied areas, the constant maintenance of air superiority, and the victory of local counterattacks are all characteristics of the Soviet Union's resistance, and have given international observers a very deep impression.

The most urgent problem facing the German army now is the coming of winter in the Soviet Union. In the third offensive, the German army took a completely defensive posture in the middle route. In the north, the solid defense of more than a million troops in the Leningrad military district, no matter how much power Germany uses to attack, it is unlikely that it will be seen before winter. So it seems that once winter comes, all large-scale military operations from the Arctic Ocean to the border of Ukraine will have to be temporarily suspended. As for the southern route, if the German army can break through Ukraine before winter and reach the Caucasus area, then it can of course continue to fight in this milder climate and advance towards the Near East and India: otherwise, it can only switch routes and break into Turkey, and then advance towards the Near East. However, taking the German army's advance rate in the past eleven weeks as an example, if Germany wants to break out of Ukraine to the Caucasus and the Near East, in fact, the fourth major offensive is unlikely to achieve its goal, and there must be a fifth, sixth, or even more new attacks. Each time, a million or two million fresh troops, thousands of aircraft and thousands of tanks must be added. This is not allowed by Germany's existing resources, whether in terms of people or materials. Therefore, it is inferred that it may break into Turkey, which has relatively weak resistance. However, in that case, it will make more enemies and force Turkey to join the British and Soviet sides in a joint operation. Of course, it is very obvious that Germany and Italy, after the possible disappearance of the Soviet military structure, must choose between retreating or breaking out. However, retreating is tantamount to accepting defeat and waiting for the British and Soviet counterattacks to arrive: but on the other hand, even on the prospect of a full breakout, there is still no hope of success. The fate of Germany and Italy's failure, after eleven weeks of intense fighting between Germany and the Soviet Union, can be said to be more fully evident.

Then, the focus of the world's attention in the future will only be on two points: first, the Soviet counterattack, and second, the cooperation and counterattack actions of Britain and the United States. In terms of Soviet military strength, whether based on everyone's peacetime estimates or the actual combat process, it has been proven that it is fully capable and prepared to turn from defense to offense. In terms of Britain and the United States, it can also be concluded from their various expressions and measures that their final determination and courage to act in concert with the Soviet Union and defeat the aggressors in one fell swoop are unquestionable. So in reality, these two points are just two sides of the same question. Under the circumstances of a complete British-Soviet military alliance, they will of course wait for the appropriate opportunity to launch a simultaneous attack in one fell swoop. The timing cannot be predicted, of course; but it can be generally predicted that this final action will appear in a coordinated manner, rather than a separate action. Therefore, the recent meeting of British and Soviet forces in Iran, in addition to blocking Germany and Italy from advancing eastward, can also be regarded as the prelude to this common major counteroffensive.

### Japanese Government Maintains a Cautious Attitude, Military Says It Will Not Shrink from War if Necessary

Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd: Acting spokesman of the Information Bureau, Mr. Iwai, said today when receiving foreign news reporters that he was asked about the situation of the Japanese-American negotiations in Washington. The spokesman replied that he thought it would be better to say less at this stage. He was asked whether the speech given by Mr. Mabuchi last night had any relationship with the Japanese government's policy on the Washington talks. The spokesman replied that there was none, because he only spoke from the general position of the Japanese people, and did not specifically refer to the Japanese-American talks. He meant that it would be a mistake to make speculations based on Mr. Mabuchi's remarks. The spokesman continued to refuse to make further comments on the Japanese-American relationship, and said that President Roosevelt had already spoken about it. The Pacific Ocean is too vast to speak lightly. A reporter asked if the negotiations eventually broke down, would there be a serious situation following? The spokesman said that the negotiations are still in progress and cannot be criticized. Moreover, the Japanese government has not yet received a reply to Prime Minister Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt. He was asked if there was any sign that the full text of the Prime Minister's letter would be published in the near future. The spokesman replied that he could not make a decision at this time.

Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd: Colonel Mabuchi, head of the Japanese Army Press Corps, said yesterday in a "East Asia Radio Broadcast" that Japan must break through the ABCD encirclement. If necessary, it will use force to do so. It is foolish to sit and wait for death. Now Japan will make intense diplomatic efforts to overcome the serious crisis that Japan is encountering. But if these efforts fail, it will be forced to use force, regardless of how long the war will last. In the desperate struggle to save our great history, we will not hesitate to fight to the last person and raze our land to ashes. Mr. Mabuchi's speech and the emotions expressed by the Japanese military are in stark contrast to the cautious attitude of Japanese government officials, who are now awaiting the outcome of the compromise between US President Roosevelt and Japanese Prime Minister Konoe.

### American Labor Day: Four Hundred Tragic Deaths

Haitong News Agency, New York, 2nd: On American Labor Day, many people died due to traffic accidents. From the evening of the 29th of last month to this morning, a total of 187 people were killed by cars, 47 drowned, and 72 died from other causes.

### Soviet Delegation to the United States Arrives in Alaska, a Total of Forty-Seven People, the Mission They Bear is Temporarily Kept Secret

United Press, Nome, Alaska, 2nd: Fedotov, Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in the United States, arrived here by plane yesterday to meet with the Soviet representatives, forty-seven in total, who arrived in Nome on Saturday aboard two giant Soviet seaplane bombers. Mr. Fedotov flew from Fairbanks to Nome and immediately met with the Soviet representatives who had arrived shortly before. The Soviet representatives all refused to reveal the purpose of their mission. Mr. Fedotov officially said that the rumor that many of the Soviet representatives were excellent pilots who would drive bombers from the United States to the Soviet Union was nonsense. The so-called Soviet representatives are going to the United States to borrow money to buy military supplies is also inaccurate. The purpose of this trip is temporarily kept secret. The two Soviet bombers are scheduled to depart for Washington today, but Mr. Fedotov refused to reveal whether he will accompany the representatives to Washington, or will return to Washington on a commercial flight.

Reuters, New York, 2nd: Five Soviet officials have arrived in San Diego, California, and are currently negotiating with United Aircraft Corporation to purchase giant Boeing aircraft. Company officials admitted that several Soviet seaplanes landed in Nome, Alaska yesterday, carrying forty-seven passengers. These aircraft were all purchased from the company in 1937. Residents of Nome have speculated about this matter, saying that most of them are aviators, and some will drive American planes to the Soviet Union, and some are technicians who have come to discuss technical issues. According to previous telegrams, all of these Soviet passengers are aviators, mechanics, and wireless telegraph operators, and the leader is Gromov, all of whom hold diplomatic passports.

### Important Changes in Japanese Naval Personnel, Ito Appointed Vice Chief of Staff

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: It was announced here that Admiral Ito of the Navy was appointed yesterday as the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of the Navy. Naval figures attached great significance to this new appointment.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: It was announced here yesterday that Admiral Kondo of the Navy, Vice Minister of the Navy, has been entrusted with "important maritime duties." The details were not announced.

### Japanese Nationals in the Philippines Wait for Ships to Return to Their Country, But This Is Not Called an Evacuation

Reuters, Manila, 2nd: Consul General Ninnake denied today the news from Tokyo that 3,500 to 4,000 Japanese nationals are currently here waiting for ships to evacuate and return to their country. It is said that although hundreds of Japanese nationals are waiting for ships to return to their country as a result of the restrictions of the business freeze order, it is not an evacuation.

United Press, Manila, 2nd: Most of the Japanese employees of the Southern Mining Company, which operates a mine in the Clanton area, left on a Japanese ship carrying iron ore on August 30, leaving only the manager and a few employees.

### Overseas Chinese in Singapore Launch a Movement to Aid Britain

Reuters, Singapore, 2nd: The movement to aid Britain organized by the Chinese Relief United Association took shape last night. A thousand Chinese representatives from various groups and associations participated here. The association, under the chairmanship of renowned industrialist Chen Jiageng, reaffirmed the belief that democratic countries will win the final victory, and unanimously passed a resolution to send a message to Prime Minister Churchill and the Mayor of London. This movement will continue to be held this week.

### Japan Lodges Another Protest Regarding American Oil Shipments to the Soviet Union, Dissatisfied with the American and Soviet Replies

United Press, Tokyo, 2nd: Deputy Spokesman of the Cabinet Information Bureau, Mr. Kishikawa, announced that the United States and the Soviet Union are not satisfied with Japan's protest against the United States' shipment of supplies to aid the Soviet Union to Vladivostok, so Japan lodged another protest. The spokesman told the press that the United States and the Soviet Union expressed their opinions on Japan's protest, but from Japan's point of view, these opinions are not satisfactory. Japan does not consider this reply to be the final reply, so Japan lodged another protest. Mr. Kishikawa said in reply to questions that the United States' opinion and the Soviet Union's opinion are slightly different. Mr. Kishikawa replied when asked that Japan is concerned about the route taken by the supplies and what the supplies will be used for.

### The Results of the Soviet Counteroffensive: Heavy Casualties for Nazi Troops; German Pincer Movement Blocked by Heavy Rains in the North; Soviets Employ Heavy Tanks in Combat in the Central Sector

Moscow, 2nd (United Press) – The Supreme Headquarters announced yesterday that as a result of the Soviet Union's fierce attacks on the Nazis along an 1,800-mile front, the number of Nazi wounded has reached millions, constantly being transported to Germany and Nazi-occupied countries. The Soviet side claimed that Soviet forces have launched large-scale counteroffensives, intercepting German troops in various important war zones, and annihilating 1,400 Finnish soldiers in a fierce battle. The announcement further stated that the Red Army's counteroffensives have been aided by heavy rains, turning several parts of the front line into swamps. The German pincer movement against Leningrad is also reportedly stalled. The powerful Soviet forces in the central sector, led by Dutov, seem to have made significant progress in their counteroffensive. Another counteroffensive, led by General Lovtsovitsky along the Smolensk-Moscow highway, has driven back Nazi troops, inflicting thousands of casualties on the Germans. Radio Moscow also reported that since the start of the war, nearly 170 German divisions have been annihilated. German reinforcements from the west have been sent, and "in the two months since the war began, German casualties have exceeded two million."

London, 2nd (Reuters) – The Eastern European front remains quite intense, as evidenced by both German and Soviet reports. The Soviet High Command has yet to disclose anything, while the German side reports that Soviet forces are launching extensive counteroffensives not only in the central sector but also in the southern sector, downstream of the Dnieper River, and in the northern sector, south of Lake Ilmen. It is reported that Soviet forces have now deployed 50-ton heavy tanks for land combat and are using gunboats along the Dnieper River to harass German bridgeheads. The situation still needs further clarification before a proper assessment can be made. However, it is evident that General Timoshenko and General Budyonny are currently leading fierce counteroffensives to eliminate German attempts to find weaknesses in the central sector. The Dnieper River near Kyiv in the central sector is quite narrow, making it easiest for the Germans to look east towards the Don and Donets River basins. Although the Soviet withdrawal from Vyborg has not been officially confirmed, there are sound military reasons to believe the Soviets have taken this step, shortening their lines of communication and making it easier to defend Leningrad. The rumor that Soviet forces were ordered to withdraw for political rather than military reasons is contradictory in nature and should not be readily believed. The German side also admits that continuous rain south of Lake Ilmen in the main Leningrad war zone is hindering military operations. Therefore, weather is becoming an increasingly important factor in the Soviet defense.

### Red Army in Smolensk Attempts to Annihilate Bock's Forces

London, 11th (United Press) – The Soviet forces' even fiercer counteroffensives today on the Leningrad, Smolensk, and Gomel fronts indicate that the Soviet forces are adopting a large-scale pincer movement, with the aim not only to isolate Field Marshal Bock's advancing forces from the main German forces but also to protect the flank of General Konev's forces, which are striking from Rogachev towards Bobruisk. The right wing of the Soviet forces, led by Major General Rakovsky, is currently using powerful mechanized units to advance towards Smolensk. The left wing is led by General Konev, whose target is Bobruisk, 160 miles southwest of Smolensk. Another third wing of the Soviet forces is attacking Field Marshal Bock's forces in the Gomel sector. With these three prongs, the Soviet counteroffensive in the central sector seems to have developed into a general counteroffensive, threatening both sides of Field Marshal Bock's forces from Smolensk to Pribyaty. British military experts here believe that this decision is the most significant action the Soviet High Command will take. Although the Soviet side has maintained silence regarding this counteroffensive and has not confirmed British reports, it is understood that this action is proceeding smoothly, with considerable success in at least one operational zone. It is reported that the German troops in that area are retreating in disarray, leaving behind many dead, wounded, and prisoners. It is said that the Soviet forces are repeating and developing their actions from July, aiming to encircle Field Marshal Bock's forces around Gomel. British military experts point out that when the German side began its apparent attempt to advance towards Ukraine, they complained about the dust storms. Their current situation is even worse, as almost all roads are muddy due to heavy rains. The German right flank has softer ground, while the left flank is under attack by the Red Army led by General Konev. Military commentators point out that if the Soviet forces can effectively encircle Pribyaty from Bobruisk and Zhlobin, they could deliver a truly major defeat to the German forces. At the same time, they insist that the German forces are trying to cut off or encircle the Soviet salient. However, according to reports, the initiative seems to be with the Soviet forces. For three weeks, the Soviet forces have been strengthening their counteroffensives, clearly aiming to encircle Field Marshal Bock's forces or at least disperse their strength and clear them out. According to Swedish reports, Soviet forces are already engaged in street fighting in Gomel and it is believed that General Konev's forces have occupied Rogachev and Zhlobin. After these two locations were recaptured by Soviet forces in July, they were never reoccupied by the Germans.

### German Aircraft Launch Fierce Attacks on Various Sectors of the Eastern Front; Crimea Also Bombed

Berlin, 2nd (International News Agency) – According to an announcement by the German official news agency, German aircraft today launched fierce attacks on Soviet supply resources and transportation arteries along the eastern defense line. It is claimed that since the start of the Eastern Front war, this is the first time German aircraft have bombed the Crimean Peninsula. Important targets in western Crimea were fiercely bombed by German Stuka dive bombers. The major Soviet naval base of Sevastopol is located there. German aircraft also fiercely attacked the rear of the Red Army under Marshal Budyonny, which is launching a counteroffensive on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The bombs all hit fortifications, airfields, and railway lines. Berlin openly admits that Soviet forces have launched large-scale counteroffensives on the central and southern fronts but claims that these counteroffensives have all been repelled. The German News Agency also stated that the railway junctions at Gonotop, Kursk, and Bryansk along the Moscow-Kyiv railway have all been completely destroyed by the German Air Force, along with several sections of track and numerous Soviet trains. On Sunday, fifteen Soviet trains on the central front were attacked by German aircraft, with several trains completely destroyed. Regarding the northern front, the news agency also claimed that German forces are intensifying their pincer encirclement of Leningrad, with the German Air Force assisting German forces to great effect.

### Finnish Casualties in This War Against the Soviets Far Heavier Than Last Time

Moscow, 2nd (Reuters) – TASS, citing a Swedish capital dispatch, reported that, according to a leading Finnish representative visiting the Swedish capital, Finnish casualties in the past ten weeks have been heavier than during the 1939 war against the Soviets. The German side has completely entrusted the heavy burden of operations in the northern sector to Finnish forces but has provided insufficient assistance to the Finnish side in terms of weapons, and the German Air Force has provided little assistance to Finnish ground operations. This is the reason for the extremely heavy Finnish losses, causing deep dissatisfaction among Finnish soldiers towards the German forces. Furthermore, German forces have completely plundered Finland's food supplies, and the Finnish people are now suffering from famine.

### Iran and British-Soviet Representatives Sign Armistice Agreement; Red Army Ordered to Halt Advance; Welcomed Everywhere

Ankara, 1st (Havas) – According to reliable sources here, British, Soviet, and Iranian representatives have signed a formal armistice agreement in the Iranian capital.

London, 2nd (Reuters) – Although there is still no confirmed news here about the British and Soviet ministers having sought armistice terms from the Iranian government, responsible sources suggest that over the past three days, the British and Soviet ministers in Tehran and the Iranian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister have reached a compromise on broad principles. It is said that during the meetings between the two Iranian cabinet members and the British and Soviet ministers, much goodwill was expressed. In addition to the broad principles already decided, there are still some details to be agreed upon. Although the nature of these details is still unknown, it can be determined that from now on, Germans will no longer be able to create disputes within Iran for the British, Soviets, or Iranian government. It is now understood that the question of the continued existence of the German embassy in Tehran and how to deal with its staff is one of the outstanding issues to be resolved.

Budapest, 1st (Havas)

The "Mena Pao" here recently carried a dispatch from its correspondent in the Iranian capital, stating that all roads from Iran to Turkey are now under the control of the Red Army. Iranian refugees attempting to flee to Turkey have been forced to turn back midway. The Red Army will soon enter the Iranian capital, and the people are living in constant fear. Most residents have fled outside the city, hiding in the mountains and forests. The food problem is also very serious. Most farmers are keeping their surplus grain for their own use and are unwilling to sell it. Shops are closed, and the market is bleak. Rumor has it that some civilians held protests in front of the British and Soviet embassies, protesting the invasion by the British and Soviet forces. However, after the authorities announced martial law, they immediately arrested many military and civilian leaders and informed the people to quickly hand over their weapons to the authorities.

Bilevy, 2nd (TASS) – The Red Army, which has entered Iran, is continuing its advance according to plan. Tanks and infantry are crossing mountains and ridges in excellent spirits and are being welcomed by the Iranians along the way.

### British Times Discusses Diplomacy Towards Iran

London, 2nd (Reuters) – The Times said in an editorial today that Britain should deal with Iran decisively. In recent years, British diplomacy has been indecisive, allowing Germans to carry out conspiracies in Iran. The Iranian King and his advisors have been manipulated, disregarding the important interests of the Allied countries. The terms of the agreement with the Iranian authorities must no longer be tolerated. Enemy aliens who have not fled to Turkey or Afghanistan should be regarded as prisoners of war and detained, as Nazi secret agents are no less harmful than tanks and aircraft.

### Severe Shortage of Gasoline in Afghanistan

Quetta, 2nd (Reuters) – According to news from Kandahar, there is a severe shortage of gasoline in Afghanistan. Camels and other animals are now being used to transport goods, and transportation costs have risen sharply. Each car in Kandahar can now only purchase half a gallon of gasoline.

### Sixteen Chinese Army Units on the Eastern Battlefield Launch New Offensive; Many Important Locations Recaptured in Three Days; Chinese Forces in Southern Shanxi Also Achieve Major Victory

Chongqing – A military spokesman reported today on the recent offensive by the Chinese forces on the Eastern Battlefield, stating that the Chinese forces were divided into sixteen units, each unit further divided into several detachments. From August 25th to 27th, they launched attacks in eastern Fujian, southern Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and northern Jiangxi. They have recaptured two county towns, two market towns, entered three county towns, completed their missions, and then withdrawn, completely occupied the outer strongholds of seven counties and one town, and partially occupied Nanchang and Fuzhou, the provincial capitals. The Japanese suffered many casualties. This action by the Chinese forces can be described as a small-scale probing attack or a reconnaissance in force. Therefore, its targets were limited to the enemy's salient points and lines of communication. (Havas, 1st)

Chongqing – In addition to launching offensives in sixteen locations along the coasts of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu and in Anhui and Henan, the Chinese forces are also attacking in southern Shanxi along the Datong-Puzhou Railway.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing; Many Civilians Killed and Wounded; He Lian and His Wife Injured, One Son Killed; American Red Cross Committee Members Also Narrowly Escape

Chongqing – According to someone who came here from the South Bank, as a result of the Japanese aircraft bombing the mountains on the south bank of the Yangtze River on Saturday and Sunday, at least 200 people were killed or wounded. He Lian, the head of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and his wife were injured, and their son was killed because the He family lived in the mountains and did not enter the air-raid shelter during the bombing. A bomb hit their house, and He's son was killed instantly. Several members of the American Red Cross Committee also narrowly escaped because the committee was meeting at the Voltbe's residence on Saturday afternoon. Those present included Young, Volt, Hulkotte, and Libby. After the air-raid alarm sounded, everyone decided to enter the shelter to avoid the bombs. As they were walking through the woods, they saw many people hiding in the woods. Soon after, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs and bombed the woods, killing and wounding many Chinese. As the committee members were stepping out of the air-raid shelter, they suddenly saw a large number of people swarm into the shelter, making it impossible for the committee members to enter due to overcrowding. At this time, the second batch of Japanese aircraft appeared in the sky, and a bomb landed about thirty feet away from the committee members. Fortunately, there was a small pile of debris separating them, so they were not injured, which was indeed a narrow escape. At the same time, twenty bombs landed on the Friends Church school and Volt's residence. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Sichuan Province's Fixed-Price Grain Purchase Measures Announced by the Ministry of Food; Grain Price Set at 30 Legal Tender Yuan per Shi; Grain Prices in Various Provinces Are Trending Downward

Chongqing – The Ministry of Food has announced Sichuan Province's fixed-price grain purchase measures, setting the price of grain at 30 Legal Tender Yuan per shi, plus 7 dou of grain depot certificates, 7 dou of wheat, and 8 dou of corn, equivalent to 1 shi of grain. The purchasing agencies in various counties and townships should post the names and quantities of households to be purchased on a weekly basis.

For example, Hunan's price is 15 to 30 yuan per shi, and the prices in other provinces vary, but none are as high as Sichuan Province's.

Zhejiang rice is over 30 yuan per shi, Jiangxi rice is over 40 yuan, Hunan rice is 60 yuan, and Guangdong is only over 90 yuan. It is said that the reasons for the price decline are that, first, the autumn harvest is expected to be bountiful, and second, the government's control has stabilized the psychology of the general public, causing hoarders to worry that they will not be able to sell their goods and scramble to dump them.

### China and the United States Share the Same View on Preventing Aggression and Laying the Foundation for Permanent Peace; Believe That the United States Will Never Abandon Its Traditional Far East Policy; Wang Shijie Praises British Foreign Secretary Eden's Speech

Chongqing – At a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters on the afternoon of the 1st, Minister Wang Shijie of the Central Propaganda Department commented on the US-Japan talks and Foreign Secretary Eden's speech. Minister Wang's remarks are recorded as follows. Minister Wang began by stating that, regarding the US-Japan talks, since Secretary of State Hull has made it clear that they are only of a trial nature and have not reached the negotiation stage, I do not intend to make any more detailed criticisms of the reports in the press, as most of the reports are imaginative speculations. We firmly believe that no matter what stage these talks reach, the United States will never abandon its traditional Far East policy. China and the United States share the same view on preventing aggression and laying the foundation for permanent world peace. This has already been seen in Foreign Minister Guo's expression of praise for the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration. Therefore, China and the United States are fully determined to realize this view. Wang continued, saying that the United States' great patience may be exploited by Japan to buy time to complete military preparations in Vietnam and the four northeastern provinces. We must pay close attention to this point. In the past, the policy of patience adopted by democratic countries has been regarded as a sign of weakness by aggressive countries. Therefore, all of the above points must be noted by the Washington authorities. At this point in his talk, Minister Wang praised Foreign Secretary Eden's speech. Foreign Secretary Eden said in his speech, "(These two fundamental principles) are not only the guiding principles for our relationship with Germany after the war, but should also be the guiding principles for all international relations." The Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration also contains this meaning. One of the two major principles is to disarm aggressive countries, as stated in point eight of the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration. (1st)

Chongqing – The Central News Agency recently stated that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi's financial opinions were submitted to the Central Bank Committee yesterday. The written opinions also guaranteed that China would assist the democratic countries in preventing aggression and building world peace. It also stated that the government's food plan is proceeding smoothly and that the food situation is improving. (Havas, 2nd)

### Queen of the Netherlands Delivers Broadcast; Anti-Aggression Group Expanded; Tolls the Death Knell for Hitler

Reuters, London, 2nd. To commemorate her 61st birthday, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands broadcast to the Dutch people worldwide last night, stating that after more than a year of oppression, the strength and will of the Dutch people are stronger and more invincible than ever before. The Netherlands will assume a part of the responsibility in the new world order sought by the British Prime Minister and the American President. Hitler, the great enemy of humanity, wanted to destroy the Netherlands, and although he has used his military force to overwhelm the Dutch people and deprive them of their freedom, and his brutal army has looted extensively, causing the Dutch people to suffer famine, Hitler's attempt to crush the soul of the Dutch people has failed. The Dutch people are brave and unyielding, resolutely resisting, and the Dutch army and merchant sailors have repeatedly achieved successes, which are commendable. The entire Netherlands is determined to fight until victory. The Queen then expressed her respect for the people of other countries and the Dutch people who share the same fate and resist Nazi tyranny, saying that now that our common enemy has turned to inflict his slaughter and looting on the brave Soviet people, the united people are intensifying their resistance and preparing to ring the joyful death knell for the common enemy and his detestable order. This death knell is the harbinger of the people's liberation.

The Dutch Prime Minister reiterated the current situation in the Netherlands, saying, "All my main political friends are imprisoned, many university professors are confined in concentration camps, traitors occupy important positions, patriotic people are brutally murdered, torture is used as a tool of governance, prisons are overcrowded, and the tree of freedom planted in the Netherlands centuries ago has had its roots axed. The whole of Europe is now a large prison, and the vicious jailer, Hitler, knows only violence, not justice."

### Preventing Manipulation and Hoarding, Limiting Gasoline Purchases; Providing Gasoline to Cars Based on Previous Needs; Gasoline Reserves Have Not Decreased, No Need to Panic; Three Major American Oil Companies Have Implemented New Supply Systems Separately

The Shanghai Times reports that the Asiatic Petroleum Company and the Mobil Oil Company in this city have limited gasoline supply at their service stations to "normal usage." Mobil and Texaco have also stopped all credit transactions, only accepting cash.

Cash Transactions

According to oil company executives, limiting gasoline supply is aimed at preventing speculators from hoarding and is not due to a decrease in gasoline supply in the city. Texaco, however, has not imposed any restrictions on gasoline sales. Company personnel even stated that there is no need to limit gasoline sales in the short term. The public only needs to pay in cash and can still purchase as much gasoline as their car's fuel tank can hold at Texaco service stations. Mobil stations also only accept cash transactions, and customers can only purchase a "normal" amount of gasoline each month. This amount is calculated based on the number of gallons of gasoline each customer used in previous months. Now, when customers refuel at Mobil stations, the station records their car license plate number and totals the amount of gasoline purchased each day. If the total exceeds their usual consumption, the sale will be refused until the beginning of the next month when they can resume purchasing. The Asiatic Petroleum Company still offers credit to customers who previously purchased gasoline with cash and were registered with Asiatic service stations, allowing them to continue purchasing gasoline with cash.

Average Usage

However, regardless of whether customers pay in cash or on credit, the amount of gasoline they can purchase is limited to the average amount they purchased between April and June of this year. New customers who go to Asiatic service stations to refuel, whether paying in cash or on credit, will be refused. The three oil companies stated that these new regulations will remain in effect until further notice. The Asiatic Petroleum Company's notice to customers stated that "the company will notify customers immediately when its inventory and supply situation improves." However, personnel from Asiatic and the other two companies emphasized that gasoline supply has not decreased significantly and that the restrictions on sales are intended to prevent hoarding and protect car owners who cannot store large quantities of gasoline. Otherwise, car owners will suffer significant losses.

Signs of Hoarding

The reason for these changes is that, because of the current disruption of shipping, it is uncertain when the next shipment of gasoline will arrive. However, there are signs that speculators are attempting to take advantage of the situation to hoard gasoline. Therefore, the new regulations are implemented to prevent hoarding and protect car owners who cannot purchase and store large quantities of gasoline. Otherwise, car owners will suffer significant losses.

Japanese Restrictions

According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the Japanese authorities, considering the extreme importance of gasoline for national defense, have decided to impose controls. Japanese merchants and residents in Nanjing have already begun implementing these controls. The restriction measures were decided and announced by the Japanese authorities in Nanjing at 3 PM on the 1st: Commercial vehicles are allowed 2 gallons of gasoline per day, commercial trucks are allowed 3 gallons of gasoline, private cars are allowed 1 gallon of gasoline per day, and private trucks are allowed 1 gallon of gasoline. It was also decided to implement a gasoline purchase permit system. Mr. Sugie advocated the slogan "One drop of gasoline, one drop of blood," urging Japanese people to economize as much as possible.

### Today Marks the Second Anniversary of the European War; Foreign Residents Silently Pray for Victory, No Ceremonies Held

Today marks the second anniversary of the European War. On September 1, 1939, Germany launched an offensive against Poland, ignoring the British ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of German troops from Poland. Britain then officially declared war on Germany on this day two years ago, followed by France's declaration of war. Thus, the European War broke out again, affecting the entire world. Shanghai, as an international city, has maintained a neutral position through the Joint Settlement authorities for two years, expressing deep sympathy to all parties. Today, on the second anniversary of the European War, foreign residents, filled with patriotic sentiments, will only silently pray for the final victory of their home countries and will not hold any commemorative ceremonies. The consulates of Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and other countries will also continue to handle official business as usual.

### Frozen Funds of All Industries Can Be Applied for Release; Funds of All Banks Have Been Fully Released

Since the United Kingdom and the United States, at the request of the Chinese government, implemented a freeze on Chinese funds, the Ministry of Finance, in order to protect the legitimate trade of Chinese merchants and stabilize public sentiment in Shanghai, agreed with the United Kingdom and the United States to grant the Central Bank the right to release these funds. All funds of Chinese citizens that have been frozen can be requested to be released by the Central Bank. The Ministry has already formulated methods and notified the Central Bank to comply. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank that, after being granted the privilege by the United Kingdom and the United States to release frozen Chinese funds, the bank has collected and released the frozen funds of Chinese commercial banks engaged in foreign exchange business. Foreign exchange bought and sold in August has already been settled, collected, and processed. Foreign exchange deposits previously received by Chinese commercial banks can also be transferred to the Central Bank with the consent of the depositors or sold to the Central Bank at the prices set by the Ministry: US$9.165 and £3.225. All foreign exchange held by various industries can be deposited into the Central Bank to open new accounts in the original currency or sold to the bank. However, personal checks must be guaranteed by the bank. If various industries need to withdraw foreign exchange in the original currency for legitimate purposes, they should first go through the application procedures according to law. After approval, payment will be made in the original currency. If it is for the purchase of necessities, it must not conflict with the revised regulations on prohibited imports, and the order contract, invoice, and other supporting documents must be submitted for review.

### Limited Export Bills of Exchange Affect the Exchange Rate

But Recent Export Congestion Will Greatly Increase the Supply of Bills

Yesterday (the 2nd), the demand from merchants in the black market for exchange rates increased. Generally speaking, the impression is that the black market in this city will continue to exist because except for HSBC, which still quotes the legal exchange rate, most other banks in this city buy and sell black market exchange rates. However, the number of export bills of exchange issued is very limited, and the fluctuation of the exchange rate in this city is not proportional to supply and demand. The reason for this may be that. According to speculation, the recent American ships leaving the port carrying a large number of goods should greatly increase the supply of export bills of exchange in the foreign exchange market.

It is rumored that a Resolution Has Been Reached on Bid-Winning Transactions

The Shanghai Times reported that there was a dispute in the Shanghai gold market between the long and short sides regarding the settlement standard for August futures. The shorts insisted on settling according to the HSBC quote stipulated by the Exchange Stabilization Fund, while the longs insisted on settling according to the black market exchange rate. After consultation, a compromise was reached, and the dispute was resolved. However, because the settlement method for the September term has not yet been decided, futures trading remains suspended. Some merchants purchased U.S. dollars at the HSBC quote of 5.3125 yuan, which was quite difficult or even impossible. Whether the black market exchange rate will be used as the settlement standard, or whether the compromise number between the legal and black market exchange rates will be used according to the August term gold settlement method is still under negotiation. Yesterday morning, gold market colleagues continued to meet to decide on a new method for maintaining gold market buying and selling short. It is reported that a resolution was reached yesterday, stipulating an opening price of 9,000 to 9,140 yuan. However, no decision has been made regarding futures trading and the September term settlement method.

### The Henderson Troop Transport Ship Will Arrive Today

Carrying a Batch of Replacement Troops, Exact Number Unknown

The U.S. Navy transport ship Henderson, carrying military supplies from the U.S. via the naval bases of Honolulu and Guam to Shanghai, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on August 30. It then wired the U.S. Navy authorities here that it would arrive in Shanghai on September 2. According to officials from the U.S. gunboat Smith in Luzon, the ship may arrive today due to delays on the voyage. The ship is carrying a batch of replacement troops to Shanghai to fill positions. The exact number is unknown by Mr. Smith. U.S. Army and Navy attachés withdrawing from Japan will travel on this ship. It is reported that fifty or sixty soldiers from the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment whose service in the East has ended will also depart on the ship.

### Bowden Going to Singapore to Be Responsible for Unblocking Supply Lines; Singapore Has Become the Activity Center of the British; Bowden's Transfer as Representative Adapts to the Times

The North China Daily News reports that Bowden, the Australian Trade Commissioner to China, will soon leave Shanghai for a new position in Singapore. His title is "Official Representative of Australia" and he has the authority to handle political, commercial, and administrative matters. With Bowden taking on a new position, the Australian Trade Commissioner's Office in China (located in Shanghai) also closed yesterday (the 1st).

Shanghai Office No Longer Necessary

But the main reason for the closure of the office is that Australia is implementing wartime restrictions and has prohibited exports, so the Australian government feels that it is unnecessary to waste the maintenance costs of this office. Considering that Singapore has now become the centralized location for the defense and activities of the British Empire in the Eastern Hemisphere, Bowden's appointment as the official representative and his relocation to Singapore are reasonable, as Bowden is familiar with Far Eastern affairs.

Bowden Responsible for Communicating Supply

Any consultations between the Australian and Malayan governments, especially regarding supplies, will be communicated by Bowden in his capacity as the official representative, with the assistance of a commercial secretary and a political official, to handle all diplomatic and commercial matters. According to Bowden yesterday, after the end of the European War, China will purchase a large amount of Australian wool and manufactured goods, and what is particularly important for China will be the import of Australian industrial manufactured goods.

Leaves Shanghai Soon to Assume His New Position

Bowden has a wide circle of friends in Shanghai. He will bid farewell to them within two weeks and set off for Singapore with his wife. He also plans to return to Australia soon to pick up his two daughters for a family reunion.

Bowden arrived in Shanghai on September 6, 1935, to take office as the Australian Trade Commissioner to China. He had previously resided in China for over twenty years and was born in Sydney, Australia in 1886. During World War I, he joined the British Expeditionary Force and fought in France. He was discharged in March 1919 with the rank of Major. He has written two novels that are highly regarded.

The approved lists for the first and second batches will be paid out starting today, and free referral letters will be issued. However, for the third batch of approved names announced today, while the free referral letters can be collected today, the scholarships can only be collected from tomorrow onwards, as the accounting department has a heavy workload in issuing checks.

Industry and commerce employees who are keen to pursue further studies but have not yet applied should come to the office to obtain a form, fill it out, and submit their application as soon as possible. As for the various vocational supplementary schools that have donated to establish free places, our newspaper will send letters to each school for record-keeping and express our heartfelt thanks. We hope that each school will provide convenience to applicants with our newspaper's referral letters. Yesterday, the Hudong Commune and Cambridge English College also donated free places (we regret that we will no longer accept free places from today onwards, as the application process is about to close). There are continued deductions from various sectors, which are recorded as follows:

Cambridge and Hudong: Donations from Two Schools

They can enroll in both the main and branch campuses, but please contact our head office." (Note: The head office is at 5110, 5th floor, Cishu Building, with classrooms on the 3rd floor.)

### Grain and Oilseed Cake Exchange: Afternoon Market Resumes Yesterday

Rice Trade Still Subject to Prohibition

The Grain and Oilseed Cake Exchange at 15 Avenue Edward VII, as stipulated by the trade association, routinely suspends afternoon trading during the hot summer months. This year, it has been more than two months since the suspension began on June 25th. It ended on August 31st, and because the summer is over, the afternoon trading of the market resumed yesterday. All kinds of trading for the same industry are as before. However, the rice trade in the afternoon is still prohibited and has not been restored. It is hoped that all members of the industry will abide by this and not exceed the norm.

### Rice Shop Raises Prices Privately; Shop Owner's Confession is Cunning

The authorities of the British and French Concessions in this city, because the people's food supply is being monopolized and manipulated, which affects public order, jointly agreed to sell rice shipped to Shanghai at a limited price and posted Chinese and Western price tags in front of each rice shop as a standard. Recently, the Yuanxing Rice Shop at 20 Huanghe Road in the French Concession was found to have raised the price of Saigon rice, which had a limited price of 120 yuan, by 4 yuan. This was discovered by Chinese and Western detectives of the French Concession Police, who took the shop owner, Chuan Yunbo (60 years old, from Tianjin), along with the account books, to the police station. According to Chuan's confession, the Chinese standard limited price was rewritten, but the Western text could not be rewritten, etc. The head detective questioned him about why the account books also showed a price of 124 yuan per stone. Chuan had no answer. The head detective ordered him to be detained for further investigation.

Moreover, the fingerprint on the resume was not his own, in order to

However, no one was injured. Afterwards, the Japanese immediately blockaded the surrounding area and conducted a large-scale search, but the result was fruitless. Unexpectedly, the Japanese announced the day before yesterday that the case had been completely solved, and suspects Quan Senlin, Quan Changsheng, Zhong Weigui, Cai Chongren, and Zhou Yinglong, among others, had been captured. However, the Japanese have not yet announced where these six people were captured. It is also reported that all six people have been executed.

Commercial News

### Food Grain; The Rice Market Does Everything It Can to Reverse the Situation; Frequent Rises and Falls Make it Hard to Bear; Yesterday, the Short Squeeze Once Fell Below the 110 Yuan Mark; Then, Borrowing Rumors to Turn Around Again

Yesterday, the foreign rice market was weak first and then tight. At the opening of the morning market, it was still wary of the previous day's momentum and remained weak. The actual sales were sluggish, and the scalping business was also quiet. The original buyers and sellers tried to sell as soon as possible, and the prices fell step by step. By midday, high-quality Saigon No. 1 had fallen to 124-125 yuan, secondary rice was only 118 yuan, Siam No. 2 was 108 yuan, bank warehouse short squeeze was 110 yuan, and foreign machinery was 108.5 yuan. After this thorough drop, the wind of covering shorts and the general floating holders recognized that the short squeeze had entered the 110 yuan mark, seemed to be temporarily stable, or on the way to circling, and rose up to absorb at the same time. The market situation gradually saw a reversal from weak to tight. Then, rumors started, foreign exchange shrank, and the hope of peace between the United States and Japan was dashed, all of which were bullish news, which led to the pull-up by large households and the jumping of scalpers. The market rose rapidly. The short squeeze was good at 112.5 yuan. The Yinghua Company was currently at 130.5 yuan to 134.5 yuan, the road was 140 yuan to 141 yuan, Siam No. 2 was at 124.5 yuan to 129.5 yuan, and broken rice was 98 yuan to 19.5 yuan, which was much larger than the previous market. The transaction increased to 17,000-18,000 bags, and the Yinghua Company reached more than 1,000 tons. The situation was good again later.

Although the rice merchants were reversing the situation, a large amount of foreign rice still arrived at the port. The Taikoo Company's Suzhou wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (1st) evening, loaded with 24,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to unload. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng wheel arrived at the port yesterday morning, also carrying 16,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. Also, the Wallen Foreign Company's Grant wheel decided to ship 2,800 tons of foreign rice directly from Yangon, which is estimated to be more than 28,500 bags, and arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong to unload. Yesterday, the three wheels loaded more than 68,500 bags of foreign rice in total. Therefore, no matter how the rice merchants disrupt the market, the fact is there. Even if an accident occurs, the food supply of Shanghai will not be in a panic situation. (Zu)

The continuous arrival of thick and thin Japonica rice has caused the market to weaken, people's hearts are depressed, and the route is lax. The cargo owners are also willing to sell, so the prices of thick and thin Japonica rice have continued to fall by 2-3 yuan. Kainang Port early rice was 157 yuan to 155 yuan, Wuxi original package special Japonica rice was 154 yuan, the general market was 147 yuan, and the secondary was 142-143 yuan. Pudong new Japonica rice also fell by about 2 yuan, opening at 156 yuan, to 55.5 yuan.

The glutinous rice sales market is still not smooth, so the price continues to depreciate by 1-2 yuan. However, the high-quality special goods are quite strong due to the lack of goods in the market and still need to open at 128 yuan, the general high is from 125-126 yuan, and the secondary is to 120 yuan. The supply and demand of glutinous tea is similar and has not had any honor or disgrace, continuing to sell at 114 yuan, and the secondary is to 110 yuan.

### Foreign Vermicelli Fell Below the Mark; It Stood Out Again Yesterday

The continuous fatigue and fall of foreign vermicelli has been too much, which has attracted the attention of new large households. Although new deals have been repeatedly rumored after the price was lowered, the canned vermicelli that was wired at 28 yuan the night before last was withdrawn, so there was no new decision made recently. And the shortage of legal foreign exchange can not be guaranteed. The lack of vermicelli is a fact. The old fleet and warships that have been standing at 34 yuan for a long time are now in short supply and are selling well. Therefore, at the opening of the morning market, large households absorbed in the front, and floating buyers purchased in the back. The transshipment gang also took the opportunity to inquire at a low price. Jinlong brand East Warehouse quoted a price of 30 yuan and 4 jiao, then to 30 yuan and 6 jiao, West Warehouse 30 yuan to 30 yuan and 2 jiao, and the Battery 31 yuan and 8 jiao to 32 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the tight foreign exchange and the rebound of rice and grain, the scalpers became more active in the bullish rumors. The cargo owners were strong, and the customer storages competed to buy. The price has risen more than one yuan. Jinlong East Warehouse from 31 yuan and 5 jiao to 31 yuan and 7 jiao, West Warehouse from 31 yuan and 1 jiao to 5.5 jiao, and the closing price was 31 yuan and 4 jiao. The Battery also reached 32 yuan and 6 jiao. Miscellaneous brands such as banana and cabbage opened at 32 yuan, which was nearly one yuan to 1.57 yuan higher than the previous day. More than 20,000 bags were traded. Only two or three hundred bags of vermicelli at 34 yuan 1-2 jiao were embellished. Wheat bran was also shouted half a yuan higher at the same time. The Japanese bran at 33 yuan was still unwilling to sell smoothly.

Wheat, in the end, is still just a little bit. However, in addition to a few factories in the suburbs, there are also small tickets of three or four hundred bags arriving in Shanghai by rail. The Japanese factory limits the price at 45 yuan, and the local factory is at 48-49 yuan, but yesterday afternoon, the rice flour rebounded, and the handlers took the opportunity to increase the price, unwilling to relax easily.

### Oilseed Cake; Edible Oil Drops Sharply

Yesterday's edible oil market situation, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil futures trading was quite prosperous. Speculators pressed first and then entered, making full use of their ability to change. It was found that at the beginning of the morning market, the selling wind continued strongly, and many households were still struggling to sell, so the market once again dropped sharply by more than ten yuan. Later, rumors suddenly rose, and new buyers repeated their enthusiasm and rose back by six or seven yuan. As a result, it was generally lower than the previous day by five or six yuan. The total market transaction was more than 10,000 dan of Qing oil under the September contract of Dayou Factory, and more than 6,000 barrels of rapeseed oil of Rihua Factory. As for spot trading, it became more sluggish. Raw soybean oil was even controlled by general large households and lacked a formal market.

### Finance Exchange Supply Falls Short

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the HSBC listed price and the small counter prices remained unchanged. The small counter price of the Bank of America was under pressure from import firms, shrinking from $4.875 to $4.75. This indicates that the unofficial British and American exchange market is tightening. The Asian Petroleum Company and a certain company still have large coal settlement amounts. The limited supply from American and other banks is insufficient for distribution. Therefore, the US dollar tightened from $4.84375 to $4.78125, and the British pound also softened to 2 shillings and 8.4375 pence. In the afternoon, Socony Mobil Oil also began rushing to settle, and the market situation became even tighter and difficult to recover. It ultimately closed at the tightest price, with active trading.

Kerosene Settlements Remain High

Since morning, British and Indian currencies in the overseas telegraphic market were stable. American banks and the US exchange market were closed for holiday, and there was no trading. The British pound to Shanghai exchange rate also remained unchanged, and the central listed price was still stable. The opening price of the domestic market was the selling price of banks, with spot British pounds at 2 shillings and 8.875 pence, and US dollars at $4.84375, with the British pound tighter by 0.03125 compared to the previous day's close, and the US dollar also softer by 0.03125. After opening, the market trended towards tightening. The Asian Petroleum Company came to rush to buy spot US dollars at $4.8125. American and other banks had a slight supply for sale at times. The HSBC listed price remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was still levied at 24.50%. Coal settlements continued, also forcing settlements at $4.8125. The Citibank small counter's US dollar softened from $4.875 to $4.75, causing a tightening trend again around 11 o'clock. The noon closing price of the US dollar tightened to $4.78125, and the British pound also tightened to 2 shillings and 8.4375 pence.

The Black Market Becomes Increasingly Tight

In the afternoon, a certain American bank unexpectedly absorbed spot Dutch US dollars at $4.78125, leading to Socony Mobil Oil also rushing to buy at only $4.75 after 3 o'clock. The market situation continued to tighten. Until the 4 o'clock closing, the British pound tightened to 2 shillings and 8.828125 pence, and the US dollar was at $4.75, with the British pound tighter by 0.078125 and the US dollar tighter by 0.125 compared to the previous day's close.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Stable

Hong Kong, 2nd (Tuesday) telegram: The exchange market opened steadily this morning. Both British and American exchange rates remained unchanged. Shanghai and Japanese exchange rates were also not quoted, with rates but no market.

Tianjin US Dollar Slightly Tight

Tianjin, 2nd (Tuesday) telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. London currency exchange and "United Notes" unofficial market showed no fluctuations. New York telegraphic transfer tightened by 0.0625 to $5.5625. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 0.5 yuan to 86.5 yuan.

### Amidst Scattered Buying, Cash Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the gold market was still trading in cash on the unofficial market. Trading was thin, and market prices were quite firm, having returned outside the 9,100 yuan mark. Foreign exchange was tight due to the rush buying by oil and coal companies, inevitably affecting sentiment. From early morning, Chen Kee bought 40 taels from He Sheng, and Wing Fung Yue bought 10 taels from De Fu, pushing the price up to 9,100 yuan, 20 yuan higher than the previous day's trading high. Subsequently, the price continued to rise amidst scattered buying. Fuk Hong Wing bought 10 taels each from Wing Shing, 9,120 yuan; De Fu bought 20 taels from Shih Ho, 9,130 yuan; Cheung Wo bought 10 taels each from Fuk Hong Wing, Lap Tai, and Man Fung, at 9,150 yuan. Later, with limited demand and supply, the price was raised by 50 yuan before further transactions occurred. Shun Yuen bought 20 taels from Tai Fung, and Ming Fung bought 20 taels from Wing Fung Yue, with the price rising to 9,200 yuan.

Futures Settlement Price Among Experienced Traders

Last night at 5 o'clock, the United Exchange Association convened a meeting of 40 brokers to discuss the new settlement price for gold futures in the future. The Association proposed using eight factors, including cash, British gold pounds, British gold bullion, US gold pounds, US gold notes, British exchange, US exchange, and Hong Kong notes, to determine the new settlement price through a weighted average. A valuation committee consisting of five members from the Association and two representatives each from gold shops, silver shops, securities firms, and money exchange businesses, totaling thirteen members, would be formed to evaluate and determine the settlement price at the end of each month for clearing outstanding positions at the end of the month. The meeting will continue today for further discussion. If approved by one party, there is hope for new trading to begin tomorrow (Thursday).

### Yarn and Cotton The Many Bullish Factors Send Yarn Prices Soaring Straight Up, "Double Horse" Breaks Through 700 Yuan Mark... Keen Short Covering in Yarn Futures

After fluctuating for two days, the yarn market rebounded sharply yesterday, mainly because rumors spread that the prospects for peace between the US and Japan had disappeared again. Those who had been selling off, realizing their misjudgment, were eager to cover their positions. As a result, the market sentiment shifted, and buying interest intensified. The fundamental issue is still the abundance of speculative capital. Accounts with ample financial resources absorb supply and remain inactive. It is mainly speculators who are rolling in and out. When sellers flock to the market, prices plummet. Once short sellers profit and attempt to buy back, and momentum strengthens, the upward pressure intensifies. Conversely, a slight easing leads to a sharp decline. According to market rumors, some are scouring the market for cotton cloth, and it is believed that foreign exchange for imported cotton is difficult to obtain, causing market sentiment to fluctuate and prices to rise accordingly. The highest price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1,795 yuan, and the low was 1,682 yuan. In the afternoon, the exchange price rose sharply, with cotton yarn up 40-50 yuan compared to the previous day, and cotton cloth up 1.78 yuan. Driven by this, "Double Horse" yarn was initially traded at 1,696 yuan, then gradually rose to 1,707 yuan. The closing price was 1,706 yuan, and the off-market price was 1,709 yuan.

The morning market for "Double Horse" yarn opened high, with the initial price at 1,682 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,687 yuan. Subsequently, with the exchange price rising, market sentiment continued to strengthen. It fluctuated between 1,687 and 1,688 yuan for quite some time. However, sales to customers were poor, and Hong Kong merchants were slow to take delivery, so the situation was flat. At the same time, trading was also not active. Once it reached 1,688 yuan, with the exchange closing price continuing to rise, market sentiment was boosted, and short sellers were disappointed and covered their positions. The market gradually rose to 1,694 yuan, and continued to strengthen after closing. Statistics show that 6,610 bales were traded in the morning. The quantities purchased by each group are as follows: Hong Kong 20, Tong Hang 6,500, statistics 6,610.

Although news regarding the "Double Horse" yarn futures market remains uncertain, the trend is gradually upward. In recent days, competition between bulls and bears has often led to selling at highs and buying at lows, causing market prices to fluctuate wildly. This morning, the market opened with higher factory orders and optimistic sentiment, leading to short covering and aggressive buying by bulls. As a result, the opening price for September delivery was 1,602 yuan, up 6 yuan; October delivery was 1,603.0 yuan, also up 12.5 yuan; November delivery was 1,649 yuan, up 6 yuan. Subsequently, with the exchange gradually rising, speculators and bulls took advantage of the situation to absorb supply, creating a tight market. 9,330 bales were traded in the morning. In the afternoon, market sentiment became even stronger, with the near-term contract reaching 1,600 yuan, October delivery rising to 1,628 yuan, and November delivery rising to 1,667 yuan. There was only a slight pullback in the morning, and the afternoon rally was due to a lack of significant selling, resulting in minimal correction. Although the underlying factor was the lack of US cotton trading, the rise in the exchange was the main reason for attracting buyers. As a result, September delivery closed at 1,615 yuan, October delivery at 1,643 yuan, and November delivery at 1,666.5 yuan, each rising by over 20 yuan. A total of 17,909 bales were traded throughout the day, a decrease of 2,780 bales from the previous day. Furthermore, the outstanding balance for the three months ending on the 1st was 23,620 bales, with 7,150 bales for September delivery, 9,390 bales for October delivery, and 7,080 bales for November delivery. The daily opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded below (net prices):

### Concerns that Cotton Funds May Not Obtain Foreign Exchange, Imported Cotton Prevented, Spot Cotton Already Raising Domestic Yarn Prices

The Shanghai foreign cotton market is quite firm. However, due to the impact of difficult approval procedures for cotton fund applications, fixed-price transactions remain sluggish. At the same time, a small number of cotton firms are also shifting their attention to the acquisition of spot cotton. If foreign cotton is ordered without being able to obtain standard foreign exchange, there will be many twists and turns in the future, and the delivery date is far off, with no business certainty. Wouldn't it be better to abandon that and purchase spot cotton, which yields more benefits? With cotton yarn trending upward, and all foreign cotton sources suddenly facing insurmountable difficulties, the spot cotton market will undoubtedly become prosperous. 一

The New York cotton market was closed yesterday for the American Labor Day holiday.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering, followed by a fall due to profit-taking by bulls. However, the market subsequently rose sharply again due to widespread buying. As a result, the closing prices yesterday rose by about 10 rupees each. Furthermore, it is predicted that the opening market today will be flat, similar to the closing price.

Also, the Indian cotton statistics from September 1st of last year to August 30th of this year are recorded below (each bale is 400 pounds):

Total listed in Bombay: 3,200,000 bales

Remaining in stock: 1,286,000 bales

Total listed in Karachi: 1,270,000 bales

Total exported: 1,359,000 bales

Remaining in stock: 139,000 bales

The spot cotton situation has not been as strong as the yarn market recently. The reason is that the raw material cost for 20-count yarn is said to have exceeded the yarn price, resulting in thin profits for factories. Therefore, factories are observing the situation with regard to raw materials. However, 23-count and 42-count yarns still have substantial profits.

Peng Chia Po No. 514: 10 lots delivered to the warehouse

Next, Peng Chia Po No. 480: 100 lots delivered to the warehouse

Hangzhou Cotton No. 285: 300 bales also

Yuyao Cotton No. 280: 1,000 bales also

Fire Engine Cotton Bales No. 30: New Yu, 500 bales delivered to the factory

### Securities Domestic Debt Slightly Rebounds, Footing Still Considered Firm

The government bond market turned bearish yesterday, but the footing is still considered firm. Large bullish accounts have not let go and have continued to add to their positions. This phenomenon is due to a temporary surge in selling pressure. Excessive selling may still help the bullish side in the future. The timing for a peaceful resolution is not yet ripe. "Only those who endure hardship can rise above others." It is best to patiently wait for daylight. Yesterday morning, Xin Fu continued to buy, and Le Mao, Heng Kang, Shun Tai, and Hong Da also had demand. However, Da Hua had a large amount of selling, and Da Zhong, Yi Tai, Ding Kang, and Zhong Yi, among others, were selling off. Class C bonds opened at 1.20 yuan and closed at 0.04 yuan, slightly rebounding. In the afternoon, Le Mao and Hong Da continued to buy. De Chang, He Feng, Yi Zhong, and No. 25 were also actively buying. The lowest price seen was 70.03 yuan, as Run Li, Run De, Lian He, Ding Kang, and Yi Ji sold off. As a result of the competition between buying and selling, the prices rebounded slightly by 0.025 yuan to 0.095 yuan. The total transaction volume was over 2.22 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

In stock trading, 200 shares of the Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 47.10 yuan.

Although trading at the Stock Exchange Association is brisk, the activity has decreased compared to before. Prices are very stable, not far from the general level. The potential of both industrial stocks and rubber stocks still seems quite good.

### Sugar Market Sugar Prices Rebound Rapidly

Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded sharply due to the tightening of the black market exchange rate and rumors that supply would be suspended. The dissipation of the "Afu" sentiment was also a contributing factor. The spot price for Grade 24 coarse white sugar set by the association was 125.50 yuan for August imports, 126.10 yuan, 128.50 yuan in the afternoon, 129.50 yuan, 128.80 yuan, 125.30 yuan for July, 128.50 yuan, 125 yuan for June, 128 yuan, all up about 4 yuan, 124 yuan for April, up 1 yuan, Dutch red (KD mark) 120 yuan, NT mark 114 yuan, 110 yuan, all up 1 yuan, Hong Kong coarse white 120 yuan to 122 yuan, up 3 yuan, Taikoo car white B mark and HX remained at their original prices. The futures price for Grade 24 coarse white sugar for September 10th delivery was 125.40 yuan, 125.70 yuan, 127.90 yuan, 128.50 yuan in the afternoon, 131 yuan, 128.20 yuan, up 3.20 yuan, 126 yuan for September 20th, 127.90 yuan, 129 yuan, 130.70 yuan in the afternoon, 129.70 yuan, 129.60 yuan, up 3.50 yuan, totaling over 32,000 bales traded in futures and over 9,000 bales in spot. Grade 1 ice sugar was 163 yuan, and Jingming ice sugar was 165 yuan, up 8 yuan. 1,070 bales of sugar were imported on the 2nd, transported from Hong Kong.

### Coal White Coal Dealers Gradually Recognize Justice, Beginning to Sell Spot and Not Issue Delivery Orders

Regarding the white coal market, general hoarders believe that prices will rise again next month and are holding back from selling. However, the result is quite different. As the exchange market lengthens and supply continues, dealers have begun to supply to the minority of spot sellers in the industry, only selling for immediate delivery and not issuing warehouse receipts to prevent hoarding. This is indeed a timely way to stabilize the market. All dealers should not only supply the industry with limited spot goods but also directly supply users' needs with a considerable amount of coal at any time. In this way, foreign companies can enjoy their profits as usual, users will not have to worry about a lack of coal, and they will not be oppressed by the manipulations of the bureau. If all foreign companies only supply large hoarders and small and large dealers, they are simply acting in collusion with the hoarders. While "wanting to eat lamb brains, they do not care about the lamb's life," they are turning black coal into blood and not considering that engaging in too much injustice will lead to their own downfall. Yesterday, with dealers paying more attention to justice and supplying spot goods without issuing warehouse receipts, hoarders had no way to exert their skills, so market sentiment stabilized and the market atmosphere calmed down. The local door and store fronts previously scoured the black market for warehouse receipts, with high costs. Briquette costs 540 yuan per ton, and extracted blocks cost 560 yuan, delivered to customers, including transportation costs, it is said.

### North-South Goods Red Rice Up 300 Yuan in Ten Days

Red rice has not arrived for a long time, and market inventory is dwindling day by day. Therefore, the market has been gradually rising recently, reaching unprecedented high prices. Even considering the market prices in the past ten days, the increase has been nearly 300 yuan, it is said.

### Education News Rescuing Shanghai, Ningbo, and Shaoxing Students Who Have Lost Their Schooling, Zhejiang Provincial Temporary Middle School Set to Open, First, Second, and Third Division School Sites Already Found, Fourth Division May Be Entrusted to Yingda for Co-operation

(Lishui Correspondence) The case of Zhejiang Province establishing a temporary middle school to accommodate students withdrawing from Shanghai and the Ningbo-Shaoxing war zones has been reported previously. Now, the school's recent situation is of great concern to all parties. This reporter made a special visit to Director Xu of the Department of Education, who informed me of the preparation situation of the temporary middle school as follows: The temporary middle school was originally scheduled to offer senior high school, junior high school, simplified normal school, senior sericulture, junior sericulture vocational courses, senior industrial vocational courses, and senior commercial vocational courses, accommodating a large number of students. If managed centrally, there would not only be no suitable school buildings, but also difficulties in procuring meals. After sending personnel to various places to survey school sites, it was decided to manage them separately by location and division. The planned budget was approved by the Ministry of Education in late July, with the tasks of surveying and requisitioning school sites, the heads of each division presiding over the opening of grades and classes, and examining and registering students, handling distribution, etc., all not being determined in a short period of time. Therefore, the start of the school term must still be in September. The school name is set as Zhejiang Provincial Temporary Middle School, divided into several divisions, depending on the actual needs. The first division is located in Chongren, and Pan Xijiu, the former director of training at Shaoxing Provincial Middle School, has been appointed as the director, opening senior high school, junior high school, simplified normal school, and other classes. The second division is located in Ganlin, Sheng County, and Miao Zutong, the former principal of the sericulture vocational school, has been appointed as the director, opening senior and junior sericulture vocational courses and other classes. This division does not accept ordinary middle school students. The third division is located in Xiuxi Township, Changshan, and Sun Zhengrong, the appointed director, has gone there to prepare. Senior and junior high school and other classes will be opened. The third division requires the purchase of all equipment, making preparation more difficult. Therefore, the estimated opening of school will be slightly later. The fourth division plans to open senior industrial vocational courses, but the school site is still under consideration due to the relationship between equipment and student practice. In the future, it may be entrusted to Yingda for co-operation. As for the senior commercial vocational courses, because there are not many commercial students currently registered, opening classes seems uneconomical. It is planned to review the applications and distribute them to existing commercial schools for study. Student registration has been extended to the 15th of this month due to the obstruction of news from various places and the isolation of news within the occupied areas, in order to ensure universal knowledge and avoid anyone being left out. Therefore, the original publication date has also been extended accordingly. However, registration letters are still coming in. Statistics are now being compiled, and examinations and distributions are being handled. A list will be published in batches in the newspaper in the coming days. Students requesting relief will be reviewed and decided by each division.

### Ding Shan Art Exhibition Closing

Chen Dieye's Ding Shan Painting Exhibition closed on Sunday. Despite the continuous rain and wind, viewers came in droves, not minding the hardship. Sunday happened to be a sunny day, so the Da Xin Hall was very crowded. According to people on site, this hall had the fewest and most exquisite exhibits and the highest achievements, with this exhibit being unanimously considered the best. It is a pity that Mr. Ding Shan was ill and unable to attend the seven-day art exhibition, which was a regret for those who wished to see his style but could not.

### Guilin Establishes a Chinese Medicine School to Cultivate Traditional Chinese Medicine Talents

For all preparatory matters, the provincial government has now appointed Liu Huining, Wei Laiqiang, Liao Shouluan, Xie Shaotang, Wang Shirong, Chen Yunsheng, etc., as members of the preparatory committee, designating Wei Laiqiang as the chairman of the committee, and has issued an official seal, immediately organizing the preparatory committee to proceed.

### School News

Qiguang Middle School: Qiguang Middle School, approved by the Ministry of Education, was newly established by Shanghai-based Jiangsu natives Gu Nanqun and Zhou Youwen, etc. Gu is the chairman of the board, and Zhou is the principal. Recently, the Zhejiang-Ningbo Building at the intersection of Niuzhuang Road and Zhejiang Road has been found as a temporary school building, enrolling 50 new students each in the first grade of the senior high school general studies department and normal school department, and in the first, second, and third grades of the junior high school department. The number of applicants has been very large recently. It is heard that the school has specially set up a night school department for the benefit of working young people to continue their studies. The curriculum is exactly the same as that of the day school. At the same time, in order to benefit poor students, many free places are set up in each grade.

### Yeh Yuan-lung Reprimands a Thief

— Yu Gong

Yesterday, this newspaper carried a report titled "Chongqing University President Yeh Yuan-lung Reprimands a Thief," which recounted how a thief, upon seeing Yeh's simple and honest appearance, gladly accepted Yeh's worn-out fox fur coat and left. Reading this, we feel that even a thief knows not to take advantage of a poor scholar, perhaps there is honor even among thieves?

Given today's high cost of living, it is not surprising that scholars are poor, it is even inevitable. If a university president like Yeh has only the clothes on his back and no savings, and professors are already becoming "teach-lean," one can only imagine the poverty of elementary school teachers.

However, a scholar's poverty is precisely what makes him valuable. A gentleman is concerned with principle, not poverty. Mr. Yeh bears the heavy responsibility of educating talents and setting an example of hard work and perseverance for national revival, and establishing a just and selfless path for young students. Mr. Yeh can be said to be content with poverty and finding joy in the pursuit of knowledge!

The perseverance of scholars, understanding principles without calculating gains, poverty is their touchstone, and poverty is not to be feared.

Ullambana Festival (2)

"Yankou" was originally a term for hungry ghosts. Legend says that the Venerable Ananda was sitting alone in a quiet room one night when he saw a hungry ghost named Yankou, whose body was thin and emaciated, with a throat as thin as a needle, and flames coming out of its mouth. The ghost told Ananda: "In three days, your life will end, and you will be reborn as a hungry ghost." Ananda was afraid and asked for a way to avoid suffering. The ghost said: "Tomorrow, give each of us hundreds of thousands of hungry ghosts and Brahmins a bushel of food, and make offerings to the Three Treasures for me, then you will increase your lifespan and I will be reborn in heaven." Ananda told the Buddha about this, and the Buddha then spoke the Dharani, saying that reciting this Dharani would make countless hundreds of thousands of food offerings sufficient. This is the origin of the Yoga Flame Mouth ritual. Therefore, blowing conch shells and performing mantra hand gestures in the Flame Mouth ritual (that is, the chief seat uses the fingers of both hands to make various gestures) all follow the rituals of esoteric Buddhism. It is not surprising that those who study esoteric Buddhism must give food offerings in their daily practice. Now, regardless of whether it is the Ullambana Festival or the Yoga Flame Mouth ritual, they are all for transcending hungry ghosts, so the emphasis is on giving food offerings. Whether hungry ghosts exist and whether giving food offerings is correct are religious matters and another question. However, today's Flame Mouth rituals only focus on the pleasant sounds of silk, bamboo, bells, and drums, and the dazzling lights of ritual implements, and almost completely lose the original intention of saving hungry ghosts. Instead of transcending them, it is simply a riot of ghosts. The malpractices of the end of the world are truly laughable!

Legend has it that after monks are summoned to various ghost realms, they must recite mantras to dispel ghosts, and there is a so-called ghost-dispelling mantra, which is actually the heart mantra of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, the six-character mantra "Om Mani Padme Hum." In the Journey to the West, it is said that Tang Sanzang's tight headband mantra can make the magically powerful Sun Wukong fall to the ground, roll around, and beg for mercy in agony, which is also this six-character mantra. Now, every time there is a Flame Mouth ritual, there must be a paper-扎 青面神 offered, with City Gods and Earth Gods standing beside it, or as portraits. This 青面神 is an incarnation of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, called the Ghost King, because according to Buddhism, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva not only saves people, but also saves ghosts, so he makes various incarnations.

Twelve Unexpected Turmoil

"If nothing had happened to Wu Meiying when she went back half a month ago, then something unexpected must have happened to her on the way into the city a few days ago. This letter must be opened for her." After thinking about it for a moment, Warden Wang opened the letter without hesitation.

The content of the letter was not long, but it kept her sitting blankly for more than a quarter of an hour in her old bifocal glasses.

"Her father said that he hadn't seen a letter from her for a long time, which clearly means that she went missing when she went back." Having this kind of thing happen, Warden Wang of course had to report to Principal Fang: "That day was the fourteenth day of the first month. Her family suddenly sent someone to look for her to go back, saying that her father had been beaten by someone. Wu Meiying was also very careful. Before getting up to leave, she specially came to discuss it with me, saying that the person who came seemed a bit suspicious. Unfortunately, that day I..."

Warden Wang spoke smoothly, almost blurting out the fact that she was drunk that day, but fortunately she realized it early and corrected herself in time.

"Unfortunately, that day I had a bit of a headache and didn't have the energy to think carefully for her, so I hurriedly approved her leave and let her go back. Now it seems that it might really be a scam!" As she spoke, Warden Wang couldn't help but sigh deeply.

Principal Fang lowered his head and pondered for a long time. (201)

### How Fluorescent Lamps Came About

— Yi Dao

Since Edison invented the electric light, fluorescent lamps can be said to be a new contribution to science. The first widespread use of fluorescent lamps was in 1938, when the New York and San Francisco expositions were held. The venues were decorated with tens of millions of brightly colored fluorescent torches, so even at night, the venues were as bright as day. However, at the time, tourists did not know that they were fluorescent and thought they were just ordinary electric torch designs. It was not until recently that fluorescent lamps became popular everywhere, and the number of fluorescent lamps installed in various countries around the world is increasing by the thousands every day.

The Invention of Fluorescent Lamps

Since Sir Humphry Davy invented the arc lamp, and Edison improved it into the carbon filament lamp, and then various scientists improved it into the tungsten filament lamp, although it has been improved by major scientists over the past fifty years, its biggest drawback is still that it wastes a lot of electricity. For example, in a tungsten filament bulb, the electricity consumed by heat accounts for 90% of the total. Therefore, the invention of fluorescent lamps can be said to be the realization of engineers' ideals over the years.

The principle of fluorescence has been known for a long time, but although many scientists have experimented many times, there have still been no satisfactory results. Until a few years ago, George Inman of General Electric invented a powder that, when applied to the inner wall of a glass tube filled with mercury vapor, would emit a very pleasing fluorescent light from the tube after electricity was applied to both ends of the glass tube. After this lamp was improved by Western Electric and Hygrade Sylvania, it became the current fluorescent lamp.

The Characteristics of Fluorescent Lamps

The biggest characteristic of fluorescent lamps is that they are highly efficient and energy-saving. They provide twice as much illumination as electric lamps, while the amount of heat generated is half that of electric lamps. The second characteristic is that the light from fluorescent lamps is cooler and softer than the light from electric lamps, so working under fluorescent lamps will not damage the eyes. The third characteristic is that fluorescent lamps can emit light of various colors without having to paint the lamp tube.

Editor's Note: For a comparison of fluorescent lamps and ordinary lamps, see Mr. Zhong Han's article on August 11 of this publication.

### The Nickel Coin Tide on the Sea

— A Mang

(1)

In the early autumn of 1941, a tide of nickel coins swept through Shanghai from the markets to the small alleys.

Shanghai is a barren place, with no ore veins or miners, but there are also ore veins and miners. In the past, scrap copper and iron were worth copper coins, so even the copper door rings of my humble house were taken as ore veins and dug away, losing a grand appearance. Thinking about it now, it is very sad.

Now the value of nickel has risen to the clouds because it is used as a raw material for airplanes. Therefore, nickel coins are qualified to ascend to heaven and have risen sharply - Shanghai's nickel mine is planted in the private rooms of wives and young ladies, and in the toy boxes of children, because the 收羅家 forgot about this little thing, and now they just realized it was profitable...

(2)

Look, Mr. Yin is particularly polite to his yellow-faced wife today: "Amao's mother, take out your privately accumulated little nickel coins from the 25th year of the Republic of China, and I'll go with you to exchange them for colorful banknotes!"

Amao's mother pouted: "Uh, you won't even let me play with the little nickel coins; what's so happy about exchanging them for banknotes? Aren't nickel coins money too? Five cents, ten cents, it's not worth much!"

Mr. Yin laughed: "This is what you call a woman, you don't understand the market outside. Do you know how valuable nickel coins are now? A five-cent coin can be exchanged for six or seven 大洋!"

Amao's mother was shocked: "Oh, so expensive? A few days ago, Amao played with five or six of them and dropped them somewhere."

Mr. Yin seemed to have dropped six 法幣, and quickly asked: "Where did they fall? Where? Find them quickly, find them quickly!"

Amao's mother hesitated: "It's nothing more than the corners of the wall."

Mr. Yin took off his long gown and squatted down to look for them - digging for a nickel mine, the shoe box rolled on the ground, raising a layer of dust.

(3)

Nickel coins are rising even more: five cents for eight or nine yuan, ten cents for seven yuan, twenty cents for five yuan...

Hardware stores started a side business: "Also accepting nickel coins," a small sign hung.

The peddlers who collect tin foil ash stretched their throats or whispered, sticking their heads in: "I have nickel coins!" - They mostly charge one or two yuan less than the "market price," and they earn this little bit. This new side business highlights the dullness of their main business..."

In front of the money shops, some refuse to accept them, but others secretly do these transactions: nickel coins flow in, banknotes flow out, flowing, flowing - invisibly flowing.

For Others and for Oneself, Service is Business-Oriented, Xin Yuan

Everyone can do their best and concentrate when doing their own business. However, when serving others, they always do things perfunctorily, holding the principle of "doing the same job every day." You should know that any occupation, directly or indirectly, is related to the happiness and misfortune of the public. Therefore, although you are only serving a certain private person on the surface, if you handle it carelessly, not only will everyone suffer from your harm, but you yourself will also suffer great disadvantages. As for the employer's loss, it is the smallest.

Because you yourself have developed the habit of being perfunctory and careless, when you want to do any kind of business in the future, on the one hand, you lack an active spirit, and on the other hand, you lack experience. Therefore, whether you serve others or do your own business, you will only be eliminated. Therefore, when we are "working for others," we must treat it as our own business, work hard, concentrate, and do our best to do it well, and strive for perfection.

For example, the American steel king Carnegie, he described his successful experience as follows:

"When I was ten years old and working as a yarn-winding apprentice in a yarn factory, I was determined to be the best yarn-winding apprentice in the world. I worked hard and did well. After doing it for a while, people discovered me and felt that it was a pity for a child like me to always be called a yarn-winding apprentice, so I was hired as a postman.

After becoming a postman, I again made up my mind to be an outstanding postman. After doing this for some time, I was appreciated and introduced to the telegraph office as a telegraph operator. Afterwards, I used the same method to achieve today's success."

The reason why Luth and Carnegie were able to do things so well was entirely because they regarded their duties as their own business. And if a person can achieve "service business-oriented," then isn't the greatest benefit still to themselves!

### Preface to Jian Lan Melody

— Zou Xiao

Xushe is a rising Kunqu Opera troupe, which I have introduced in a special article in the third issue of Wenlin Monthly. A few days ago, Xushe held its first gathering, singing songs and admiring Jianlan orchids at Ms. Xia Xunru's residence. As soon as I entered the door, I smelled the fragrant and rich scent of the king of flowers. In addition, there were many song friends, it was truly like "entering a room full of芝蘭." The song stage, dining table, and floor were all filled with Jianlan bonsai, each pot with several orchids of different shapes blooming on the dense orchid leaves. Examining Mrs. Xia's repertoire, it turned out to be more than forty excerpts, and she could recite each one fluently, singing with accurate words and melody, truly worthy of being an old opera singer. Two stage photos, one of disassembling a book and one of putting on makeup, were hung on the wall, extremely vivid and natural.

The opening performance was Xunru and Ms. Yin Junong's "Qin Tiao," followed by Yan Rui and my "Small Feast," Miss Pan and Yin Zhenxian's "Good Date," Ms. Cai Shuliu's "Thinking of the Mundane," and my "Picking Up the Painting." Later, Yin Zhenyi (he and Zhenxian seem to be brothers, and both are doctors, but they are not of the same clan) also came, and he sang an excerpt from "Welcoming and Crying."

The most rare thing was that Yu Zhenfei also arrived at this time and sang "Sweeping Flowers," singing clearly and loudly, and full of charm. Paired with Miss Pan's graceful and melodious singing, it was truly a wonderful combination of red flowers and green leaves. At this time, everyone listened quietly, the world was silent, and everyone was fascinated, and their hearts and spleens were refreshed.

Following was Junong's "Calling the Painting." Next up were Mrs. Zhou Shukang and Yao Zhangyun's "Sending Teasing" and Wang Yi's "Folding the Willow Branch." These three people's songs are usually not easy to hear, and Miss Wang had just returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. The climax was Zhenyi and Ms. Li Xitong and Shuliu singing a duet from "Wandering in the Garden and Startled by a Dream." Zhenyi sang Chunxiang, covering his face with a handkerchief, then taking a fan, squeezing his voice and singing affectedly, which was the most hilarious. The listeners all laughed at him, so everyone was happy. Even more wonderful was the final act. Zhao Zeng and Xie Junong played a tiger. Feeling pain in his arm, he cried out "哇呀呀" and the whole hall cheered. Finally, he stepped heavily on the ground to show that he was dead (how he came up with it). The listeners laughed and clapped, and even Jianlan seemed to crack a smile!

Chapter 16: Early Release the Caged Bird from Its Confines

Tian Hongyu went to Jiangnan to sweep tombs and happened to meet Yuanyuan. He thought that he, with his white hair and her red face, would form a pair of lovebirds. In the future, their amorous history would be widely spread, and their elegant charm would flow. He would not have wasted his life. Therefore, he did not hesitate to use ten斛 of pearls to forcibly carry her back, breaking up other people's marriage. Who knew that he was not blessed to enjoy this beauty. It was his daughter, the Imperial Concubine Tian, who took the lead and wanted to offer Yuanyuan to Emperor Chongzhen, hoping to relieve the emperor's worries. Of course, he did not dare not send Yuanyuan to the palace. However, he was very unwilling in his heart. Since he sent Yuanyuan into the palace, he returned to his residence, sitting alone in his study, feeling depressed. He originally had a troupe of female musicians in his residence, with sandalwood clappers, silver zithers, phoenix sheng, and dragon flutes, everything. Although Tian Hongyu was a relative of the imperial family, he indulged in music and debauchery like this, showing extravagance and lasciviousness, which shows the laxity and corruption of the Ming Dynasty courtiers. In the evening, he drank wine in the Hongqing Pavilion and ordered the female musicians to serve wine on the side. Many powder-white and dai-green beauties came to the pavilion to play wonderful music, the strings and pipes were clamorous, and the sound was靡靡. On weekdays, Tian Hongyu still felt that he was enjoying the silk and bamboo, drunk and dancing, and had a bit of interest, but tonight he felt that it added to his sorrow, and his heart could not help but be tied to Yuanyuan. Thinking that tonight, the emperor has obtained this beauty who can overthrow a country, no different from Emperor Tang Ming and Yang Yuhuan, the hibiscus tent is warm, the spring night is short, and they live together, how happy? But the old man is suffering, working for others, looking at plums to quench thirst, isn't it a waste of effort? However, thinking of his daughter's good intentions, he felt that this move was right and proper, and he could not be selfish. I hope that the emperor will favor Yuanyuan and not forget my daughter, so that the emperor's heart will be joyful, diligent in national affairs, and revive this country with enemies on all sides, and pacify the bandits, then we who climb dragons and attach phoenixes can also enjoy wealth for a long time. Alas! Tian Hongyu thought like this, but who knew that the affairs of the world are often unexpected? (158)

### Small Records of Liyuan Figures

(36) Shang Heyu

Yang Xiaolou's Wusheng surpassed all others, and it is only once in ancient and modern times. However, specifically in terms of martial arts, those who do not seek perfection in the overall beauty, then Shang Heyu is also enough to compete with him. Common people call Yang Xiaolou and Yu Zhenting together, but Zhenting's recklessness is far inferior to Heyu. Abandoning Heyu and taking Zhenting is a common view, not a fair theory. Heyu is older than Xiaolou, but Xiaolou cannot match his energy. Recently, at the age of seventy, his "双鑠" is still not careless, and "跥泥" is still standing still, as stable as Mount Tai. Those who see him are awed as if they are facing a god. This is something that Xiaolou could not do in his later years. However, Heyu only wins people with his fighting skills. As for "扮相," "嗓音," and "唱白," "表情," etc., all of them are far from Xiaolou and cannot be compared. Therefore, Xiaolou is a figure of the ages in Liyuan, and Heyu is only the best choice at the time. Although Heyu has unique skills, he has never been successful in his life. In the past, when he came to Shanghai, his signboard was even second to Yang Ruiting. His later years were slightly better, but he was still depressed and subordinated to others, never able to gallop and vent his anger. Therefore, he sold all his belongings to show his determination to retire and return to his hometown to farm. (Heyu is extremely frugal, and has accumulated a lot of wealth. He has a lot of land in Baoding.) He will never put on makeup and go on stage again to compete for a day's fame with latecomers. When he died, his ambition arose again, and he reorganized the troupe to perform again. An old man of seventy years old is so unwilling to be lonely. His spirit is strong. Isn't he a living god? However, although public opinion praises him, the prosperity of the sales seats is still difficult to achieve as he originally wished. This is also enough to show the change in public sentiment!
