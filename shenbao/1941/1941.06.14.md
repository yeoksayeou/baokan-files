### Joint Declaration of the Allied Governments: Fighting Aggression to the End, Willing to Help Each Other Strive for Final Victory, No Peace Under Violent Oppression

London – The Allied governments held a general meeting yesterday at St. James's Palace here to discuss the overall war situation. After representatives of the various governments spoke in succession, a resolution was passed expressing the Allies' united and firm determination to continue the war. The text of the resolution reads: "The governments of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada , Australia , New Zealand , and South Africa , Belgium , Czechoslovakia , Greece , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Yugoslavia , and the representative of General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French forces participating in the war, resolve as follows: (1) They will continue to fight against German and Italian aggression until victory is achieved. They will assist each other in their struggles to the best of their ability. (2) There can be no lasting peace and prosperity for free peoples held by force and compelled to submit to the dominion of Germany or its allies, or for free peoples living under such threats. (3) The only true foundation for durable peace is the voluntary cooperation of free peoples in a world free from the threat of aggression, where everyone enjoys economic and social security. Those present are willing to work together, both in war and peace, with each other and with other free peoples to achieve this goal."

Churchill's Speech

The original text of British Prime Minister Churchill's speech is as follows: "In the twenty-second month of the war against Nazism, we gather at St. James's Palace to proclaim the noble aspirations of the legitimate governments of the ravaged nations of Europe and to inspire hope in the free peoples of the world. Before us are the credentials of ten countries whose lands have been invaded and whose peoples are enslaved. Representatives of the British overseas dominions of Canada , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , and territories such as India and Burma are also gathered here. They have all drawn their swords for a cause and will not rest until their last breath or until victory is won. As we gather here, the sound of uninterrupted work from American factories across the Atlantic encourages us, informing us of the coming of swift and ever-increasing assistance. The suffering, terror, and evil that Hitler has inflicted on Europe and the world are beyond description. The destruction of Warsaw, Rotterdam, and Belgrade are unforgettable monuments for future generations, constantly reminding people of the outrage of scientific cruelty inflicted on helpless civilians by aerial bombardment. But this is only the visible damage on the surface.

### Enslaving Other Races and Creating Puppets: The Axis's Sins Are Too Numerous to Count

What is particularly heinous is the suffering of the conquered peoples, who are not only bound and intimidated but also abused. Millions of strong men are forced to work in conditions little different from slavery. All their possessions are seized or exchanged for worthless currency. Their families and daily lives are constantly spied on by omnipresent secret political police. These police not only keep the Germans themselves in abject submission but are now spread throughout the streets and alleys of more than ten countries. Religious beliefs are suppressed and destroyed to promote the fallacy of atheism and to make people worship the autocracy of one man. The good customs, culture, laws, and social and governmental institutions of the conquered peoples are either destroyed by violence or undermined by insidious conspiracies. The prisons on the continent are not sufficient to hold the prisoners, and the concentration camps are overcrowded. Every dawn, the sound of gunfire is heard. Good people in the Czech Republic, Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, Yugoslavia, Greece, Luxembourg, Belgium, and France have made countless sacrifices for their beliefs and their countries. The "Quislings," despicable traitors whom mankind will forever despise, are hired as the claws and teeth of the conquerors, harming their compatriots even as they themselves groan under the oppression. All this that I’m saying is a description of what glorious and brilliant Europe has become today, and it is against that reality that we stand up and resist."

### Fundamental Reconstruction of European Order: Not to Be Entrusted to Hitler

"Gentlemen, this is the foundation upon which Hitler, with Mussolini following behind him and Darlan attending at his side, seeks to build a "New Order in Europe" from hatred and greed. It is utterly absurd. We cannot say how the war will spread or what direction it will take. We know that it will be arduous and that it will last a long time. We also cannot predict its development. However, one thing is certain, undeniable, and recognized by the whole world: the reconstruction of Europe or the unification of European countries will never come from the hands of the Germans. Any country that has been invaded by German soldiers and police hates the name of the Germans and despises Nazism. This sentiment cannot be erased even after hundreds of years. We do not yet know how or when liberation will come, but what is most certain is that Hitler's footprints and fingerprints will be swept away completely and, if necessary, eradicated from the face of the earth. Gentlemen, we reiterate here our unity in relentless effort, seeking to liberate the fettered nations. A year ago, the British government alone faced the raging storm. At that time, both our enemies and our friends seemed to think that our days were numbered and that Britain and its institutions would be forever lost.

### Britain Will Not Easily Lay Down Its Arms Until War Goals Are Achieved

But I can proudly tell you that, even though last year the army was ill-equipped, there was hardly a cannon or a tank in the country, and almost all our military supplies and ammunition were lost in the dark days of France, we never despaired for a moment of the common cause. We not only did not despair but also declared to the world at that time our determination not to make peace until all the enslaved countries were liberated and Nazi domination was completely crushed. Gentlemen, look at how we have progressed since the emergency period of last June. Our strength and resilience have undergone a terrible test. We are now masters of our own skies and are launching increasingly heavy blows against the enemy. Our navy has regained control of the seas. The American fleet is hiding in harbors, its power diminishing daily, and the German navy has also been largely destroyed. The brutal air raids that the enemy has inflicted on our ports, cities, and factories have ultimately failed to break the spirit of our people, extinguish the life of our nation, or halt the expansion of our war industry. Food and munitions are now safely transported overseas. Replacements for sunken ships are being actively built in the country, and our American friends are helping us even more during this period.

### The British Isles Are Heavily Fortified: Any Nazi Invasion Will Meet with Misfortune

We are now gradually becoming an armed society. The land forces are perfecting their equipment and training. Although Hitler can roam across Europe and spread his fierce flames, although he can invade Africa or covet Asia, the decisive battle will ultimately be fought on this heavily fortified island of Britain. We are determined to meet him on land and sea. Wherever Hitler goes, we will follow in his footsteps to strike him. Our air force will continue to make the German people fully understand that war is not just about plunder and victory. We will encourage and assist the resistance of the people in the occupied countries. We will thwart Hitler's every effort to consolidate his gains. Hitler will have no peace, no rest, and no negotiations to be had. If Hitler tries to invade the British Isles in desperation, we are determined to meet him with the greatest test. With the help of God, we will remain steadfast in our faith and tireless in our duty until the work is completed. Gentlemen, what I say today to all countries of the world, to all freedom-loving peoples, to the allies of Europe, and to our friends in America is: "Rise up your hearts, the result is good, and the glory of mankind will be born out of suffering and sacrifice". "

### Representatives of Various Countries Gather Together: Filled with a Spirit of Solidarity

King George VI personally visited St. James's Palace to discuss with representatives of the British Dominions. Churchill introduced the Allied leaders to the King. The British representatives attending the meeting were Prime Minister Churchill, Foreign Secretary Eden, Minister Attlee, and other cabinet members. With the exception of Greece and Yugoslavia, which were represented by their ambassadors to the United Kingdom, the Allied nations were all represented by their prime ministers. The representative of General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French forces, was 开新. (Reuters, 13th)

### British Foreign Secretary Broadcasts to South America: Asks for Assistance in the Fight for Freedom

London – Early this morning, Foreign Secretary Eden made a broadcast speech to Latin America, saying that no matter how long, how difficult, how fierce, or how hindered the war may be, final victory will be ours. No one in our country doubts this; it is certain and will be decisive. British soldiers, sailors, and airmen are superior to German and Italian enemy soldiers; this has been proven. From July to November of last year, during the great battle of Britain, the Royal Air Force defeated the German planes despite their overwhelming numerical advantage; this is just one example that can be cited. Britain and other major cities may not be spared from continuous blitzkrieg attacks, but the people are not alarmed by them. On the contrary, they are uplifted by these unprecedented disasters. Planes can destroy the buildings of our nation, but bombs cannot break the spirit of our people. The great and generous assistance we are now receiving from the United States ensures the victory of the Allied forces.

### King George VI Sends Telegram to the King of Greece, Expressing Deep Admiration for Greece's Valiant War Effort

In his address to Congress in January of this year, President Roosevelt stated that he hoped the world in the future would be based on four freedoms: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Our struggle today with the Allied forces can make this noble concept of a better life a success. This is not a war of nations; it is a war of faith and standards of life. Sooner or later, everyone must decide which side to stand on, whether it be on the side of light or darkness. Eden's speech was specifically addressed to Britons residing in Latin America and thanked them for their contributions to the Empire's war effort. (Reuters, 13th)

### Soviet Union Feels Threatened: Actively Strengthening Military and Armaments: Rumors of Nazi Troops Concentrating on Border, Attempting to Force Soviet Union to Allow Passage to Attack Near East

Ankara – According to well-informed Turkish sources, the important result of Stalin's personal assumption of the post of People's Commissar is the intensification of the Soviet Union's military build-up, with particular emphasis on the expansion and modernization of the air force. At the same time, speakers in some military units are now telling soldiers and workers that it is extremely important for the Red Army to be strong enough to avoid or repel any German attack if necessary. These speakers warned their audiences that Germany was an enemy of the Soviet Union before Molotov's visit to Germany last November. After Molotov returned, the Soviet government cancelled this campaign, but it was resumed in January of this year and has become increasingly intense ever since. Turkish sources here all believe that the main thrust of Soviet foreign policy is fear of Germany. The Germans are well aware of this situation and, backed by a large number of Romanian troops in Moldavia, will probably soon make further economic demands on the Soviet government. Sources here believe that Stalin will accept the German demands because his policy is to buy time so that he can build a great army and industrial infrastructure to support that army in wartime. The same sources also believe that Stalin will resist if Hitler attempts to invade Ukraine. The Soviet government will reject any concessions that would undermine the Soviet Union, such as German control of certain railways and industries. (Reuters, 13th)

London – Foreign Secretary Eden met with British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps yesterday. At the same time, reports have resurfaced that Germany will threaten the Soviet Union militarily. A foreign embassy here reports that 75 German divisions have concentrated on the German-Soviet border in Soviet-occupied Poland, and 25 German divisions have moved to the Romanian-Soviet border. It is also reported that 20 to 25 Romanian divisions have been mobilized and are preparing for war. The report states that the Soviet Union is currently rushing to build fortifications in Bessarabia and that Soviet troops are also destroying roads near the border. Soviet sources admit that it may be true that large numbers of troops are stationed on the border, but say that Germany will not attack the Soviet Union or intimidate the Soviet government into yielding to Germany in negotiations. Turkish sources say that Hitler has asked the Soviet Union for facilities at the Black Sea ports so that Germany can advance directly to the Caucasus from Romania without going through Ukraine. German troops could then invade Iran and Iraq through the Caucasus and threaten the entire British right flank in the Near East. (United Press, 13th)

### German-Romanian Talks: Contents Kept Secret: Romanian Prime Minister Returns Home from Germany

Berlin – A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declined to reveal the contents of the talks now being conducted in Germany by Romanian State Leader Antonescu, saying only that the talks were still in progress. (Haitong, 12th)

Vienna – Romanian State Leader Antonescu, who has been meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Munich for several days, returned here by plane yesterday afternoon, accompanied by German Minister to Romania Killingen. Romanian Minister of Economy, Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force, German Minister-Counselor Neubacher, and German Generals Spittel and Hauf were at the airport to welcome them.

### Public Concession Tram Fares Increase Again

After the passage and implementation of the price increases for water, electricity, and gas, it was known that related public enterprises would inevitably follow suit with their own price increases, especially in the electricity sector, where the impact is even greater. The increase would affect the entire sector; this was inevitable. Now, the increase in tram fares in the Public Concession has been approved. The most important reason for the fare increase is that the company's revenue has failed to keep up with the increase in expenditures, and the most significant part of the increase in expenditures is the cost of electricity, which has increased more than fourfold. Although there are also so-called reasons such as the impact of the current situation on the slight depreciation of exchange rates, these are only for show! The main reason is still the cost of electricity. Now that the matter has been approved, it is almost a foregone conclusion, and there is no point in arguing about it afterwards. However, in view of the fact that public utilities are repeatedly increasing their prices, who knows if others won’t follow the trams with their own price increases, or use the excuse of public utility price increases to also increase their prices? Although the cause of this may be small, the result will be great. Standing on the platform of public welfare, one knows that it is impossible to reason with them, and there is no point in speaking, but one cannot but say something!

Public utilities cannot use the general surge in prices as a reason for increasing prices, because the general surge in prices is precisely due to private enterprises that only know how to seek profit and do not care about the overall situation. Although public utilities are also private enterprises, they are given the right of exclusive franchise. They are given ample protection in normal times, and they should plan ahead in emergencies. For example, the price of coal sold to power companies is certainly lower than the market price, not only because they have a large sales volume, but also because the coal sold in the market may not be immediately consumed after being transferred and circulated. However, this is not the case with coal sold to power companies. Furthermore, although other factories also have a need for coal, they do not have the scale of power companies and have to seek it on the market. Power companies, on the other hand, consume a large amount of coal every day, and the companies that supply coal must be large in scale and fully equipped. The shipment of coal should not be affected by the high freight rates of merchant ships. Therefore, although the market price of coal has risen sharply, the price of coal for power companies must be very different. Otherwise, it must be due to their negligence in the necessary attention to their business. Therefore, if power companies use the rise in prices and compare it with rice and coal on the market as a reason for increasing prices, it is not only inappropriate but also unconvincing. Now that the tram company's price increase is following the power company's lead, it seems to be justifiable. However, the reasonableness of things cannot be sought from the text. Reports on paper must be carefully considered before they are issued, and there is definitely no reason why they should not be reasonable. The tram company claims that its net profit has fallen sharply from 8.5% in 1936 to only 1.3% last year, so in order to maintain its due profit, it must resort to increasing tram fares to make up for the loss. This is indeed a matter of course. However, judging from the surface of the tram company's business, although expenses have increased, the congestion of passengers is several times greater than before the war. Regardless of the actual number of passengers, even if we count the number of tickets sold by the tram company, it must have increased year by year, breaking historical records. This can undoubtedly offset most of the increase in expenses. In the minds of Chinese people, there has always been a feeling that Eastern and Western cultures, thoughts, spirits, and abilities each have their strengths and weaknesses, but the service spirit and management skills of Westerners are superior, and the Chinese people of the East are indeed lacking in their strict regulation. However, one cannot hastily praise the tram company's driving management, because passengers are often crushed to death under the tram, suffer physical injuries, and face unexpected dangers. The newspapers are full of such reports. Moreover, trams often fail to stop at designated stations and speed past, ignoring the signals. They also start driving before passengers have finished getting on and off, and misfortune strikes. All of this cannot be blamed on the passengers' own carelessness but should be the responsibility of the tram company. As for buying tickets and not receiving tickets, and even being insulted when asking for them, the newspapers have discussed this extensively before the tram company decided to increase fares, but the tram company has turned a blind eye and deaf ear to it, and there is still no sign of improvement. It is regrettable! In the tram business in Shanghai, the spirit of selling tickets and giving tickets even when passengers have arrived at their stops and alighted without asking for them was only seen in the former Nanshi Chinese Tram Company. Now, instead of plugging the leaks that should be plugged and making the necessary rectifications, the tram company is only increasing the burden on the public to make up for the losses. It is expected that the higher the fares, the more coveted the revenue will be, and the deeper the abuses will become. The leaks will also become larger and larger, and it is feared that the gains will still be insufficient to maintain the net profit they should enjoy. Will they then resort to increasing prices again? This would only increase the burden on the public and would not help improve their business. Is this the original intention of allowing public utilities to monopolize? Therefore, from the standpoint of the public, the Public Concession Tram has no reason to increase prices at the moment that can gain public understanding.

As for the Municipal Council, it only based its decision on the Public Utilities Committee's request, believing that it was in accordance with the provisions of the franchise agreement and should be approved. It did not consider whether it was in line with public sentiment or whether it would increase the heavy burden on the general public! Has the tram company made its best efforts to do its best in terms of revenue and expenditure, and are there any other ways to make up for the losses besides increasing prices? Also, compared with the same business in the same area, is there a significant difference, or is there a difference in the quality of the business and the fees charged? If the Municipal Council could consider and deliberate on all of these matters in detail, and make efforts to rectify all aspects of driving management so that passengers would not face unexpected dangers or inconvenience in riding, and then approve the tram's due price increase, the people would not only have no objections but would also applaud and celebrate that the Municipal Council was truly able to know that public opinion is important and that welfare is in mind.

### Robin Moore Sunk by Germany; US to Issue Strong Protest; Demanding German Compensation and Apology; Nation to React Strongly to This

Washington - Well-informed sources believe that the US government is likely to issue a stern warning to Germany, tantamount to a declaration of war, demanding compensation and an apology for the sinking of the Robin Moore. Whether this incident will lead to a severance of diplomatic ties between the US and Germany depends on whether Washington and Berlin can agree on the facts of the ship's misfortune and who is responsible. The situation is further aggravated by the fact that thirty-five crew members and passengers are still missing. Berlin has made no comment on the matter, stating only that Germany is conducting a full investigation. As for what plan President Roosevelt will adopt, it can only be decided after he receives the report from US Vice Consul Williamson, who is personally questioning the surviving crew members in Pernambuco, Brazil. Williamson is scheduled to fly to Washington from Pernambuco today. Part of his report has already been sent to Washington by US Consul Lincoln in Pernambuco. (United Press, 13th)

Washington - Regarding the sinking of the American freighter Robin Moore, the United States seems poised to take strong diplomatic action against Germany, perhaps even more forceful measures. Various quarters in Washington are reacting strongly to the incident. Some hardliners suggest, "Escort with a battleship fleet, and open fire if necessary." Moderates, on the other hand, express doubt as to whether Germany is responsible for the loss of the Robin Moore. In any case, Washington is deeply concerned about the matter, and newspapers have already begun citing the earlier incident of the sinking of the Lusitania, which led the United States to enter World War I. The chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee stated, "We should escort with a battleship fleet and allow them to open fire. Let's see who shoots first and who can defeat the other." Democratic Senator Connally said, "The sinking of the Robin Moore was an unprovoked attack. The US government will take appropriate measures to prevent similar unfortunate incidents from recurring." Republican Senator McNary stated, "I believe the matter depends on where the ship sank. If it sank in dangerous waters, or in a war zone, or near a war zone, then we should not be overly agitated. But if it sank in peaceful waters, then the situation is very serious." Republican Senator Johnson said, "I hope this is not an unfortunate incident that they (the interventionists) are seeking." Isolationist Senator Wheeler said, "I hope this is not one of the unfortunate incidents that the advocates of intervention claim the President is seeking to bring us into the war. The United States is not prepared for war, and the people do not want to go to war." Democratic Senator Ellison said that he does not believe the State Department knows for certain that the Robin Moore was sunk by a German submarine. (Reuters, 13th)

Berlin - German informed circles stated yesterday that the Berlin military had not received any reports proving that the American freighter "Robin Moore" sank in the South Atlantic due to the actions of a German submarine. They stated that the matter is currently under investigation, but they strongly doubt that a German submarine could have done this, because "if so, the military here should have received a report by now." Since the "Robin Moore" incident occurred, German newspapers and radio stations have made no mention of it whatsoever. (United Press, 13th)

Washington - Assistant Secretary of State Welles announced yesterday, "There is no doubt that the American freighter Robin Moore was sunk by a German submarine, and the submarine commander knew full well that the Robin Moore was an American ship." It is expected that this announcement will cause a serious reaction in the United States. Welles, when addressing reporters yesterday, appeared grave and stated that according to a report from US Consul Lincoln in Pernambuco, Brazil, the Robin Moore was undoubtedly sunk by a German submarine. Welles also officially read a summary of the report prepared by the US Consul based on the accounts of eleven surviving crew members of the Robin Moore, stating, "The Robin Moore sank at 6:00 AM (Greenwich Mean Time) on May 21st, at 6 degrees 10 minutes North latitude and 25 degrees 40 minutes West longitude. The submarine commander knew the ship was American. The survivors are all in good health. Their statements have been recorded. A summary will be sent after it is translated into code. Thirty-five crew members are missing." Welles also stated that the Robin Moore was not carrying war materiel or other military supplies that violated neutrality laws. The cargo consisted of a wide variety of goods, from steel rails to women's socks, as well as various items such as automobiles and automobile parts, intended for shipment to Lourenço Marques, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, and East London in Africa. He had not received detailed reports and was therefore unable to comment further. When asked if the US government viewed the incident seriously, Welles declined to answer. President Roosevelt's Secretary, Early, stated that it seemed there was no longer reason to reserve judgment and that news could be expected on Monday, or perhaps a little later, as officials here needed to study the matter before deciding what action to take. Cautious observers here expect that the official announcement that the Robin Moore was deliberately sunk by a German submarine will spark a national reaction. The US government's seriousness regarding this matter can be seen in Welles' words. Many people have the impression that Welles' words may be the first step in preparing for a major development. Although few believe that the Robin Moore incident will directly lead the United States into the war, there is no doubt that it could take the steps to prepare the American people's hearts and minds for war, as it has brought the war to America's doorstep. (Reuters, 13th)

### Admiral Yarnell Declares: US Must Fight Germany and Japan Simultaneously; America's Border Is in Asia; Should Take Offensive Action Quickly

Washington - Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, recently wrote an article in the Washington Post stating that if Britain is not defeated, the strength of the US Navy will be sufficient to fight in both oceans, but it must not remain on the defensive. Events in Europe are moving rapidly, and active US participation in the war is only a matter of time. Japan's alliance with Berlin disregards American hopes, and the war will spread to the Far East. If Japan can successfully invade the Dutch East Indies, then the white race in the Far East is finished. Therefore, Singapore is as militarily important to the US as it is to Britain. The fact that we must accept is that if we fight Germany (which we will and should), we must also fight Japan. The sooner we understand this and are prepared, the better it will be for us. Yarnell then described the factors favorable to the United States, such as utilizing the ports of Singapore, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, as well as the British and Dutch East Indies' naval, land, and air bases. He continued that China is currently holding back a million Japanese soldiers and can intensify its fighting if supplied. The Japanese base on Taiwan is easy to bomb. Japan's maritime trade will come to an end, and Japan must fight two or three thousand miles from its home base. He argues that the United States should quickly utilize the basic principle of military victory, namely, taking the initiative and the offensive. The current US fleet is stronger than the US fleet would be in 1946 if Germany and Japan succeed in Europe and Asia. But the US fleet must fight on the border and in accordance with the principles of naval warfare. If the United States seeks victory, it cannot leave its fleet on its home waters but must take swift and decisive offensive action on the border. The American border in the Pacific is in Southeast Asia. (Reuters, 13th)

### US President Considering Oil Embargo on Japan

New York - According to the New York Herald Tribune, close to government sources, the United States is currently considering whether to halt oil shipments to Japan. If President Roosevelt takes this action, the proposed restrictions on the use of gasoline and fuel throughout New York and the East Coast could be eased, and shortages of fuel oil for heating homes, offices, and factories could be prevented, thus preventing the rise in gasoline prices. (United Press, 13th)

### Resolving the East Coast Oil Shortage

Washington - Interior Secretary Ickes told reporters yesterday that oil restrictions in the eastern United States seem unavoidable. He hopes to have a plan for civilian oil conservation within one or two weeks. He has asked the Shipping Board to inform him of the availability of American oil tankers flying foreign flags and whether they can be requisitioned to alleviate the East Coast oil shortage. According to oil industry sources, Ickes' plan aims to prevent an oil shortage this winter and to allow oil shipments to Japan. (Reuters, 13th)

### Japan Reports British and American Diplomatic Pressure on Thailand and Vietnam; Ban on Kerosene and Goods to Japan; Aizawa Criticizes Dutch East Indies for Ignoring New Order

Tokyo - The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" reports from Hanoi today that Britain and the United States are taking advantage of the stalled Batavia talks to conduct joint activities in Vietnam and Thailand to increase their economic blockade against Japan. The report claims that the United States is pressuring the Dutch East Indies in an attempt to ban kerosene exports to Japan. At the same time, Britain is currently putting pressure on Thailand to supply all goods intended for Japan to Britain. The newspaper states that British and American "business circles" are reportedly cooperating with Chinese merchants to prevent exports from Thailand and Vietnam to Japan. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" reports that rice shipments from Saigon to Japan have recently been blocked, and the Vietnamese authorities have even proposed cutting off half of the rice exports for June, July, and August. The newspaper also carries a special dispatch from Bangkok stating that Britain is using kerosene supplies as bait to curb the production of rubber and tin in Thailand in order to prevent these raw materials from falling into the hands of Japan and other Axis powers. (United Press, 13th)

Tokyo - Aizawa, the head of the Japanese delegation to the Dutch East Indies trade talks, stated yesterday that the argument made by Dutch East Indies officials, that they fear Japan would re-export Dutch East Indies goods to Germany, is an excuse for East Asian nations' unwillingness to cooperate. Aizawa strongly asserted that the Dutch East Indies is attempting to not recognize the "New Order in East Asia," which is the real reason for the breakdown of the Japanese-Dutch East Indies trade talks. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Tokyo - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii officially told reporters today that experts are currently drafting instructions to Aizawa in accordance with the policy towards the Dutch East Indies decided by the government on the 11th of this month. The government meeting on that day not only considered the attitude of the Dutch East Indies towards Japan but also took into account the international situation. After Aizawa receives these instructions, the content of the instructions will be released, along with a government statement. When asked if this meant Aizawa would be recalled before the final instructions were issued, the spokesman did not answer. (Reuters, 13th)

Tokyo - It was learned today that Aizawa, the Japanese representative in Batavia, stated in a wireless telephone conversation with the Yomiuri Shimbun that because the Dutch East Indies authorities are currently taking a tough stance and their reply is final, there is no room for compromise. Although certain points have improved after clarification, it is not enough to allow the talks to turn around. The reply from the Dutch East Indies authorities was decided after careful study by the Dutch East Indies Parliament, and there is no need to take any further steps. Therefore, there is no need to meet with the Dutch East Indies authorities again before he departs for home on the 29th of this month. The people and newspapers of the Dutch East Indies are now strongly supporting the government's tough stance, so he believes the situation will gradually become more difficult. Aizawa discounted the news of the evacuation of Japanese residents, saying that Japanese residents are not preparing for a total evacuation. The Japanese Consul-General in Batavia is currently urging Japanese residents to remain calm. Aizawa also said that the fundamental reason for the failure of the talks is that the Dutch East Indies authorities do not understand the global situation and the order that is currently changing in East Asia. The current situation is one that Japan cannot ignore or allow to continue to exist. (Reuters, 13th)

### US Believes Japan-Soviet Pact Has No Important Value; Japanese Aim Only to Deceive the Public

Washington - Commerce officials believed yesterday that the newly agreed-upon trade treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan was designed to offset the failure of the trade negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands. Experts doubt whether the Soviet Union and Japan have any military necessities to exchange in large quantities. Only oil comes to mind, or perhaps the Soviet Union could ship oil from Sakhalin Island to Japan. However, the amount of oil that the Soviet Union can supply to Japan is very small compared to Japan's peacetime needs. Therefore, it is believed that the Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations are merely a symbolic formality to satisfy the Japanese public's demands after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact. Experts also said that Soviet manganese ore is produced in the Caucasus, which is too far from Japan, and the transportation costs are extremely high. Soviet fertilizer production areas are 3,000 to 6,000 miles away from Japan, making transportation inconvenient. The production of platinum is also not significant. As for what Japan can supply, it is a large amount of silk, which is of little use to the Soviet Union except for making parachutes. Japan lacks machinery and is unlikely to supply the Soviet Union with important machinery. (United Press, 13th)

Moscow - The Japanese side yesterday expressed satisfaction with the Soviet-Japanese trade agreement. They stated that the formal agreement is not far from being finalized and that both countries are currently proceeding in a spirit of "mutual concessions." Soviet newspapers commented on the matter, saying that a foundation has been laid for resolving important outstanding issues between the two countries. (United Press, 13th)

### US President Appoints Chief Justice

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday appointed Stone as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and appointed Burns and Attorney General Robert as deputies. (International News, 13th)

### Gayda Issues Warning to the United States

Rome - Italian Prime Minister's mouthpiece Gayda wrote an article in the Italian Daily yesterday stating that US participation in the war would have two major consequences: one, to prolong the resistance of England; and two, to prompt Japan to intervene. Gayda said, "US intervention in the war would only prolong the war, because at that time the US fleet would be at the disposal of England in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and increase destruction. At that time, Japan will also participate in the war. Although the Axis powers have never intended to attack the United States, if Washington voluntarily participates in the war, then the Axis powers will have to react." (United Press, 13th)

Cairo - The Allied forces in Syria are continuing to advance while avoiding battle as much as possible, and have reached the outskirts of the ancient city of Sidon and the southern outskirts of Damascus, ten miles from the city. The main area of French resistance is along the coastal Litani River crossing and north of Matrai, blocking the central Allied forces advancing towards Damascus. After being bombarded by rifles and long-range artillery, the French forces have been defeated, and half of those who surrendered expressed sympathy with the Allied forces. Although the Allied forces have now reached the area where the French forces under General Dentz, the French High Commissioner, are concentrated, it is said here that the Vichy communiqué's claim of "fierce fighting" is a gross exaggeration. Cairo believes that Vichy may be deliberately issuing exaggerated news to prepare for surrender. There has been no news of Free French forces clashing with French forces in Syria. (Reuters, 13th)

London - According to the latest news received here, the Allied forces in Syria are making satisfactory progress. There has been no confirmation here of reports that they have reached the outskirts of Damascus. Free French forces are currently conducting flanking maneuvers ten miles south of Damascus. British forces have occupied two villages in the area, and in the center of the area, they have crossed Moqaso, the fall of which was confirmed yesterday. Moqaso was the headquarters of the Syrian border outposts and was captured by British and imperial forces without firing a shot. The resistance comes purely from Vichy forces. The main French forces have retreated north, leaving only isolated pockets of resistance in the mountains behind Kuneitra. For the past three days, British forces have tried to avoid bloodshed, repeatedly sending envoys with white flags to the French forces to demand surrender. When the requests for peace were unsuccessful, they launched an attack, and within a few hours, three important strongholds guarding the route to Beirut were captured by British forces. (Reuters, 13th)

London - Sources here say that Free French forces, supported by mechanized units and the British Royal Army, reached the outskirts of Damascus this morning. It is also said that the Allied forces are now only a fifteen-minute bus ride from the center of the city. Another report says that Vichy officials in Damascus have fled to Aleppo, forming a long line of motor vehicles and special trains carrying them north. People have been expecting the Allied forces to enter Damascus for three days, and now this expectation is becoming a certainty. It is expected that the Allied forces will enter the city peacefully, without resistance. This belief is based on reports from Cairo that the Allied forces have made a proposal to French and American officials in Syria, including Dentz, ordering them not to resist when the Allied forces enter, so as to preserve this historic city from damage. (United Press, 13th)

London - It is learned that one unit advancing along the coast is on the outskirts of Sidon and is heading towards Beirut, while another report says that fighting is raging in the vast orange groves, apricot orchards, banana plantations, and lemon groves surrounding Sidon. According to various special sources, the Allied forces are now engaged in a fierce battle after advancing west from the Litani River towards Sidon, but are being cut into several sections by French troops hiding in caves, forests, and rocks. This situation was eventually overcome through hand-to-hand combat, and progress then continued. However, some troops must apparently bypass Sidon, which is twenty miles from Beirut, and advance. As for the unit that occupied Moqaso, it subsequently reached Hasbaya and is now reportedly attacking Damascus from the east. The forces reaching the outskirts of Damascus may be waiting for other troops to arrive before entering the city. There is no fresh news regarding the two units attacking Syria from Iraq. Today, people here, after learning that Vichy admitted that Dentz's forces had abandoned their main defensive position at Moqaso, which they had been using to resist the British forces, expect the French resistance in southern Syria to collapse soon. It is believed that the unit occupying Moqaso must be attacking Rayak to the north or Damascus to the northeast. It is believed here that the naval aircraft's reconnaissance attack on Beirut is sufficient to indicate that the unit advancing along the coastal highway must be continuing to advance and may quickly occupy Beirut. Unofficial sources say that British troops have entered deep into the outskirts of Sidon, and the French forces in Kiswe are still stubbornly resisting the Allied forces, while Free French forces are trying to capture Damascus from the south. This unit is reportedly still engaged in fierce fighting with the defenders. (United Press, 13th)

London - The official French news agency claimed yesterday afternoon that the Australian forces advancing on the city of Sidon in Syria have not yet been able to break through the French resistance, and the fighting is fierce. British warships are constantly bombarding the coast. French forces are defending their positions in the orange groves around Sidon. The Australian attack is supported by tanks and heavy artillery from the fleet. The fleet, consisting of one battleship, two cruisers, and five destroyers, has been bombing the port for three days. French destroyers engaged in battle, and their shells hit two British light cruisers. Fighting continues behind Moqaso. French forces withdrew from Moqaso on Wednesday and are defending strong positions five or six miles behind the city. The Tegor troops in front of Damascus, the Syrian capital, attacked Jisso, fifteen miles south of Damascus, yesterday, but according to the latest news, the attack by the Tegor troops has been repulsed. London believes that the Vichy's news of fierce fighting may be deliberately spread to promote the French-German plan to eliminate French sympathy for England. (Reuters, 13th)

### British Government Responds to Vichy Protest; Declares No Territorial Ambitions in Syria; Vichy Lodges Second Protest Yesterday

London - According to Vichy's protest note to Britain, the current situation makes it difficult to explain Britain's attack on Syria, which may have the most serious consequences. Pending further information, France wishes to avoid taking actions that could escalate the conflict. If the dispute unfortunately escalates, France will be forced to take necessary measures to defend its territory. The protest note repeatedly stated that France has not cooperated with Germany in Syria. In its response to France, Britain refused to dispute the definition of the word "cooperation," stating that the British military's actions are based on the facts of the Syrian situation, not on theoretical concepts. Britain is pleased with Marshal Pétain's assurance of avoiding the spread of conflict. It would be for the benefit of both countries if the Vichy government could order French forces to cease resisting the Allied forces and prevent the Germans from using Syria as a base against the Allied forces. The reply reiterates that Britain has no territorial ambitions in Syria or other French colonies and states that Britain aims to achieve victory in order to restore France's independence and greatness. According to a statement from the British Foreign Office, the Vichy government's note was delivered by the Vichy ambassador in Madrid to British Ambassador to Spain Sir Hoare on June 8th. The French ambassador also informed the British ambassador of the contents of the note from Vichy diplomat Darlan to the American ambassador in Vichy on behalf of his government. In its response to the Vichy protest, Britain stated that the Pétain government should be held responsible for the Syrian French authorities' obedience to help Britain's enemies and that French bloodshed is not Britain's wish. (Reuters, 13th)

Vichy - Marshal Pétain was still trying to make peace with England last night to end the conflict in Syria and hinted that if England wanted to occupy this French mandated territory, France would cooperate more closely with Germany. The French government sent a note to the French ambassador in Madrid, Biatteley, to deliver to the British ambassador to Spain, Hoare, offering Syria peace and wanting England to acknowledge the error of accusing France of allowing Germany to occupy Syria, followed by an immediate withdrawal of troops. The note was the first communication from France since the Syrian war, and although officials hinted that this second French protest was more peaceful, the United Press knows that the tone of the note was harder than the first. The note reiterated that there were no German troops in Syria, and it strongly stated that now that England had been able to prove that there were no German troops in Syria, there was no reason to continue the war. The conclusion was a combination of the meaning of the previous two notes, stating that if the British army invaded after proving that their claim that the German army had occupied Syria was wrong, the only result would be to strengthen France's determination to cooperate with Germany in Europe.

### Guangzhouwan Bans Sale of Daguang Bao; Authorities to Protest

Shaoguan: The Guangdong-South edition of the Shaoguan Daguang Bao, which began publication on April 1st of this year in the Chinese-administered area of Cunjin Bridge, Suixi County, outside Guangzhouwan, has been well-received by all. Unexpectedly, it incurred the jealousy of Japanese agents, who demanded that the Guangzhouwan government ban its distribution and sale in the leased territory. The French authorities granted their request, banning the newspaper's entry on June 1st. Because Sino-French relations have always been amicable, this arbitrary suppression of Chinese public opinion is a clear violation of international law, causing widespread indignation. In addition to reporting the situation to the government and requesting a protest to the French side, the newspaper has also published an article reiterating its publication goals, resolving to continue its efforts to promote resistance and national reconstruction.

### Japanese Troops Driven Back in Southern Anhui, Chinese Troops Recapture Qiaotouyang, Japanese Troops in Central Hubei Unlikely to Launch Offensive, Japanese Invading Jiwang Mountain Completely Defeated

Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman recently stated that the Japanese army is unlikely to launch a large-scale offensive in central Hubei, at least for the time being.

### A Visit to the Ma Family Painting Exhibition
— Shi Chongpeng

The Yongjia Ma Family's Exhibition of Epigraphy, Calligraphy and Painting was held at the Daxin Painting Hall from the 11th to the 15th, attracting a huge crowd and reaching a peak. The late Mr. Ma Mengrong was proficient in the Six Principles and excelled at flowers, birds, insects and fish, with ingenious workmanship. He lectured at the Art College during his lifetime and had many students. Mr. Gongyu's calligraphy, painting and epigraphy are known as the Five Wonders and have enjoyed a great reputation for a long time. His cousin Bixuan, younger brother Shiling, and niece Jingjuan are either good at figures, landscapes, or flowers. The family's academic achievements are rare. I visited yesterday and was immersed in the forest of masterpieces, spending several hours in study. I had a feeling of being so engrossed that I forgot about eating meat for three days. Among them, Mr. Mengrong's posthumous works are mostly wonderful pieces. The flowers and birds are most notably "Exotic Flowers," "Trumpet Creeper," and "Sunflower." The colors are bright and dazzling, and the brushwork is strong and elegant. It is truly indescribable with paper and ink. The inscriptions are also very elegant. The inscription on "Sunflower" says, "Naturally have the intention to turn to the morning sun, pity that there is no strength to fight the autumn wind," which is thought-provoking. The inscription on "Trumpet Creeper" says, "This flower has its own ambition to soar to the sky, not relying on other branches for support." The insects and fish are most notably "Fragrant Pond Warm Waves," "Mandarin Fish and Hibiscus," "Chicks," and "Carp." They are lifelike and seem to come alive. In the marvelous places, it is as if you are personally in the Yuquan Flower Alley, and after watching, you feel like you are meeting an old friend. Mr. Mengrong is not dead! Mr. Gongyu's works include calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy. The frames such as the He Family's certain stele are unlike those written by modern people. The seal script is taken from ancient seals, the official script is obtained from the back of steles, and the carving is taken from the Qin Edict plaques and bronzes. They are simple and profound, truly unseen for hundreds of years. Most of the paintings are of pines and chrysanthemums. Bai Hua Wenzhong calls Gongyu to have the ambition of Yuanming, and it is true. The light and heavy turns all take the method of seal script. It can be compared with Li Meian and Zeng Nongran, which is especially admirable. The couplets in regular, cursive, and running script are all transformed from the steles of the Northern and Southern Wei Dynasties and the pavilion posts of the Jin Dynasty. This is commonly seen by connoisseurs, and there is no need to praise it much. As for Shiling's landscapes, they are superior in simplicity, Bixuan's figures are superior in elegance, and Jingjuan's flowers are known for their beauty. All are outstanding works.

In the Group A Table Tennis Tournament of the Chinese-Western Cup, last night at 7:30, the defending champion Youbang played against Hua Yi at the Jingwu Gymnasium.

### Food Grains: Rice Stocks at Various Warehouses Total 1.8 Million Bags; Imported Rice Arrives in Shanghai Continuously; New Orders for Imported Rice Also Being Transacted

The Shanghai Municipal Council's imported rice has arrived in Shanghai again. The Yihong Shipping Company's Fusheng Wheel arrived yesterday morning, carrying 10,000 bags of Shanghai Municipal Council's imported rice from Hong Kong, berthing at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition, 1,325 bags of imported rice are scheduled to be shipped to Tianjin on the same ship today. The Zhawu Postal Shipping Company's Zhibisha Wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying over 6,000 sentences of imported rice and over 25,000 bags of corn from Java, berthing at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. Today, 1,000 bags of corn will be loaded onto the Yihong Shipping Company's Fusheng Wheel for transport to Yantai (Zu).

Yesterday's imported rice market initially fell, then rose, and finally returned to fatigue. The market gradually showed signs of fatigue. After the opening price in the morning, the selling pressure was strong, and the Shanghai Municipal Council continued to approve 500 tons of Pingjia Gongmai rice (a low-priced rice sold by the government) per day, totaling 1,000 tons over the two days. The price remained the same as before, but it was stated that if the delivery was less than the amount at that time, it would be compensated with small-grain rice. The wholesale price of Mingdang rice was 2.7 yuan higher than that of small-grain rice, meaning that small-grain rice was 2.7 yuan lower than Mingdang rice. The retail price, however, was 2 yuan higher for Mingdang rice than for small-grain rice. Furthermore, Chinese and foreign merchants continued to peddle futures and spot rice in the market, causing the price to fall by one yuan. Subsequently, due to the price drop, sales were strong, and inland merchants were interested in purchasing. The purchase of broken rice in the interior was even more active. Rumors spread that Siam Changdi would again ban the shipment. The stock reserve this week decreased, and people's hearts immediately turned upward, and the market price rose by one or two yuan with the strong buying pressure. As a result, spot broken rice was still relatively expensive, while other sales turned sluggish and returned to even. The amount of original English-Chinese company packages returning to the market was smaller than the day before. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon rice was 137.5 yuan, then 135.5 yuan, small-grain spot was 138 yuan to 137.5 yuan, road was 135.5 yuan, broken rice spot was 107 yuan, road was 105.3 yuan to 105 yuan. Today's transaction of Yinghua Company was nearly , spot . A survey of rice stocks at various warehouses showed a total of 1,087,877 bags.

During this moldy season, thick and thin japonica rice is easily . Although the arrival of goods is not sufficient, the owners have no intention of holding on, and the intention to sell is quite loose. At the same time, stores and customers also do so. In addition to slightly purchasing to meet needs, they also lack a large appetite for accumulation. As a result, transactions have declined, and the market has continued to soften, with prices falling by one yuan. Kainang Port fresh early and late indica rice opened at 34 yuan, and then to 131.5 yuan. No one inquired about old or secondary goods, regardless of the original packaging. Miri can do business, and thick japonica rice is still only old original packaged tin japonica rice, opening at 20 yuan to 118 yuan.

Although the market supply of glutinous rice is still scarce, the local goods have turned weak, and the road has also declined, making it difficult to sell. The market price has depreciated by one yuan. Hong Kong round-grain glutinous rice opened at 113-114 yuan, long-grain at 111-112 yuan, old yellow goods at only 107-108 yuan, special glutinous tea at 106 yuan, Chinese at 103 yuan, high-quality domestic goods sold for 112 yuan to 110 yuan, secondary at 16-17 .

### New Wheat Sold for the First Time

The opening of the foreign flour market is still relatively stable. According to our investigation, the actual sales of this customer are not smooth due to the rapid rise in prices the day before. Furthermore, with the new wheat on the market, it is heard that futures have already been released, so people's hearts are naturally difficult to feel good. After Jinlong Flour was increased to 29.5 yuan the day before, buyers felt it was too expensive, so the opening price was only 29 yuan. Subsequently, due to slight sales to Nanyang customers, the price gradually rose to 19.2 yuan, with 2,000-3,000 bags transacted. There were also Fortress Flour at 30 yuan to 30 yuan, and Hongri Dangtian Flour at 29.5 yuan. The market is still brewing.

New Daily Xin handled 5,894 packages of Changzhou, Ben Niu, Danyang, Wuxi, and Chuandong goods, priced at 40 yuan. Half have arrived, and half are in transit. This is the first official sale at this price.

### Miscellaneous Grains: New Broad Beans Arrived Sparsely, Turning Expensive

New broad beans are of lower quality this year than last year, due to natural disasters and man-made calamities. Recently, prices have been high and goods are scarce, but customers are reluctant to buy. Moreover, most of the goods are transported by the street itself, so the market has only been open for three mornings, and then the downstream has already reported. (The highest price was 42.8 yuan, and the lowest was 39 yuan.) Recently, because the goods from nearby villages are scarce, it is inevitable to search in distant places, resulting in laborious bicycle transportation and increased costs. As a result, costs have risen sharply, and the arrival of goods has decreased, and the market price has increased accordingly. The day before yesterday, Qingpi broad beans from Beigang opened at 40 yuan, and yesterday's market was 40 yuan and 5 jiao.

On the 14th, miscellaneous grains were exported, transporting 350 bags of beans and 7,720 pieces of bean cakes to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Dull

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed exchange rates were all flat, and the black market for British and American exchange rates was stable with a slight loosening. The changes were even more subtle. Foreign banks were slightly willing to supply, so the July US dollar was loosened from 5.390625 yuan to a point where it could be settled. After being taken by speculators, it immediately returned to flat. The British gold also hardened back to 3 pence 3125. In the afternoon, it also returned to flat, while the US dollar remained stagnant, and no transactions were heard. The closing prices of both currencies were still the same as the previous day, and trading was extremely light.

The domestic banks opened the selling price early, with spot British exchange at 3 pence 296875 and US dollars at 5.375 yuan. Foreign banks were willing to supply, so the July US dollar was stiffened to 5.390625 to a point where it could be settled. HSBC's listed exchange rates have not changed. The silver balance tax is still levied at 23.75%. Speculators made a hedging profit, entering the June US dollar at 5.375 yuan, and settling the July at 5.375 and 40625.

### Gold Market Even More Stagnant: Deferred Delivery Was Traded Secretly in the Afternoon, Still at 25-26 Yuan Posted by the Bulls

Yesterday's gold market in the shachi black market became even more stagnant. The difference throughout the day was only 16 yuan, and the closing price was unchanged from the previous day. The situation fell first and then returned, which was because the foreign exchange market suddenly showed signs of loosening after the morning opening. Huibing Shang Dafeng even emptied and sold more than 3,000 taels. Securities firms supplied more than demand, and the price fell to 6,453 yuan, which was absorbed and raised by another draft merchant. In the afternoon, it was heard that deferred delivery had already been traded secretly (at a price between 6,461 and 6,462 yuan, with the settlement price being close to 20 yuan), and the seller posted 15-16 yuan to the buyer. The scramble to cover floating positions was slightly more enthusiastic, and it rebounded to 6,469 yuan at the close, the same as the closing price of the previous day. The hearts of all parties are still stable, and the total transaction volume for the day was 12,000-13,000 taels. Cash transactions increased. First, Fukangyong sold ten taels to Yili, with the price 260 yuan higher than the deferred delivery price. Then, Shihe entered Xianghe for 150 taels, and Yongcheng for 50 taels, both 155 yuan higher. Later, Xianghe entered Fei Wenyuan for 100 taels, and also entered Shihe for 50 taels each with Jingfu, both 260 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Tianyuan exited Xianghe for 20 taels, 245 yuan higher. Suddenly, it was seen that the low, with a small cut of 5 yuan was recorded. Gold ornaments, custom gold, etc. were all flat.

Futures Without Change

Since the morning (10 taels), the market opened at 5:15 a.m. at 6,460 yuan, which was 9 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. It was raised to 6,465 yuan by Xinfengyong and retail investors. Huibing Shang Dafeng suddenly emptied, more than 1,000 taels were sold successively by Yida, Tongkangyong, Decheng, Yiyuan, and Shunyuan, and the May US dollar at 5.390625 yuan could be settled, so the price fell to around 6,460 yuan, and the price fell to 6,453 yuan, and the situation became more stable. Xinfengyong entered more than 200 taels, and gradually rose to 6,464 yuan at noon. The afternoon closing price was 6,461 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 p.m. at 1 yuan higher, calculated at 6,462 yuan.

Ornamental Gold Stagnant and Unmoving

The outgoing price of silver shop jewelry was still 695 yuan per tael at Datongxing and Xintongxing, and the incoming price was reduced by 40 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Slight Rise and Fall

Yesterday's foreign currency market: The shachi market was as stable as ever. British and American gold pounds did not change much. The British extra notes trended downward, and the market price fell by one yuan. The US dollar notes rose by one fen, and the evening market was 16.31 yuan. Hong Kong notes trended slightly softer, and the market price fell by 2 fen. Both Japanese and Korean gold notes trended slightly higher, with the former rising to 1.54 yuan and the latter rising to 1.64 yuan.

### Securities: Government Bonds Rebound and Fall

In yesterday's black market for government bonds, the market declined due to hovering. For a time, there were many new short sellers, especially those who borrowed goods and sold short. Because it was difficult to borrow C-type chips, the chips suddenly felt exhausted. On one side, the floating bulls released, and on the other side, the financial community was still absorbing them at a low price. The major long positions remained unmoved, and the market was temporarily slapped, but it will eventually go up the peak. Yesterday morning, Yu Da received hundreds of thousands from a bank, and Tongkang also had an intake. Defu Yichang Jiufu Jiufeng Renfeng Hengfu, etc. all purchased. Runli Yuxing Lianhe and other bulls were released, and Xiekang Runde Tongsheng sold again. Hongda first exited and then entered, and Lianyide first entered and then exited. Inner stocks then advanced to the 70 yuan level. The noon closing price was 5 or 6 jiao lower. In the afternoon, Runde Lianyi Yitai captured back, and Hefeng Yongkang absorbed, but Runli Yudian was still released, and Dingkang and Hengkang also released quite a bit. The market has been relatively stable, and after the close, there was a lot of borrowing, and the chips were extremely scarce for a time. It can be seen that there are many short sellers with no goods. As a result, the market price returned by a small 4.5 to 7.5 jiao. The transaction volume was about 2.8 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock transactions: 100 shares of Wing On Company were transacted at a price of 18.75 yuan.

The public stock market is quite active, and the price is higher than the previous close. Yeguang shares were traded in huge volumes, and the market rose to 15.7 yuan at the close. Zhongying shares also jumped to 11.5 yuan. Xiangtai shares hit a high of 53 yuan and closed at 52.5 yuan. Jardine Matheson and Asia Navigation shares were both very firm, and the trading volume of the latter was amazing.

The Gibbon Oak Co., Ltd., managed by Jardine Matheson, will convene the 32nd annual general meeting on June 23 and pay a dividend of 3 yuan per share in national currency for 1940.

HSBC Bank shares continued to rise, and British-registered shares rose another half pound, to 76.5 pounds. And Hong Kong-registered shares rose 1 pound, to 79 pounds, with offers but no buyers, and there were no other changes.

### Yarn and Cotton: Long and Short Positions Strongly Defined; Yarn Market Wanders Without Progress

The road of yarn and cotton is roundabout. This is because the actual transactions are not as strong as the previous day, and the Dutch-Indian issue is tense, causing the floating longs to soften. However, some firms are severely short of inventory and fear that there will be problems with raw materials, so they still take the approach of buying on dips to go long, and the market's single-unit stacks are still dry. Deferred delivery sellers are posting 2.5 to 7.5 jiao, but the shorts are very thoughtful. As for the longs, because they have interest income, they have no intention of releasing, so the lineup of both sides is very solid, waiting for the opportunity to develop, and fearing that there will be major changes. The high price of 20-count Shuangma yarn fell by 1,465 yuan, and the low price was 1,400 white 58 yuan. The first trade in the afternoon was 1,461-2 yuan, and the last price was 1,465-6 yuan. The trading volume was not strong, but people's hearts were still high. Today, 420 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuangma opened in the morning. Due to the breakdown of the Dutch-Indian negotiations, the shorts were active and the table was weak. The first tight price was 1,400 white 60 yuan, but the big players still entered. However, most of the scalpers released, and after a while, it fell to 1,458 yuan. Then, with the price of gold flat, Shuangma still had transactions, and people's hearts , and it rose again to 1,465 yuan, but the intermediate form was mediocre, and it returned many times between 62 and 3 yuan. The closing price was 1,462 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics showed that 9,870 bales were transacted, of which 270 bales were entered by the Hong Kong gang, and 9,600 bales were transacted by the line.

The situation in the gold change Ma Biao yarn market is in a roundabout state, and the market is extremely stable. The July contract fell by 5.5 yuan from the previous month, and the August contract fell by 2 yuan. The market transaction volume was less than the previous day. The daily total was more than 8,000 bales. The daily high and low prices and closing prices are listed on the left:

Previous Market  After Market

July

Open 1390 1391

Close 1391.5 1391

Daily High 1394  Low 1390

August

Open 1400.5 1401

Close 1401 1401.5

Daily High 1405  Low 1400

### Cotton Market Soars

The selling price of Middling is nearly 460 yuan. The current cotton situation is still firm. Factories have not had weak yarn sales recently, so they enter from time to time for raw materials. As for the industry, in view of the tense international situation, they are concerned that the source will be hindered in the future, so the sentiment is consistent upward. Fine cotton prices have reached new highs, and coarse cotton and local cotton have also risen. The actual price of spot cotton is listed on the left:

Middling 458  Xinsheng Factory 100 pieces delivered to the factory

Firegrass Package 198 Hefeng Factory 500 packages

And 197 Xin Shen Er Factory Pieces and packages

Dazhong hit 170  And 243 pieces and packages

Dazhong Sen 274  And 194 pieces and packages

Firegrass Package 189  Haojia 310 packages delivered from warehouse

And 190 And 415 packages

And 192 And 150 packages

And 191 And 848 packages

And 190 And 400 packages

Middling 444  And 400 pieces

And 430 And 100 pieces

And 441 And 100 pieces

And 441.5  And 100 pieces

Brazilian Cotton 420 And 300 pieces

Middling 444.5  And 100 pieces

And 448 And 100 pieces

And 445 And 300 pieces

And 454 And 200 pieces

Another message: Foreign trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai ports, factory demand is very strong, and the compensation is quite strong. At the same time, fellow traders are aware that overseas procurement costs are expensive, and people's hearts are unanimously optimistic, so the market has been active for several days, and many transactions have been made. Yesterday, in addition to the selling price of Middling being nearly 460 yuan, the remaining West cotton and Indian cotton have also frequently advanced. Brazilian cotton, which is a raw material for 22 counts, was transacted by a foreign yarn factory for 300 pieces at a high price of 430 yuan.

New York cotton market, first rose due to buying by fellow traders, but then fell back due to reaction sales and even rainfall. As a result, closing prices fell by about a pound compared to the previous day.

Indian cotton is closed, and the forecast for the opening market situation today is to look at a small Robi.

### Piece Goods: Futures Fabric Prices Are Very Tight

Factory Hope: The market continued to be strong yesterday, and the industry's mood was good. Customer sales were smooth all the way to Hong Kong and Nanyang. Various fabric factories' futures prices were very tight. English Jardine Matheson Factory opened futures for more than 2,000 , and the sales market for white goods and bleached and dyed fabrics was not moving. Some rose by 2 jiao and 5 fen per piece. The street transacted more than 500 pieces of various fabrics. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang helped to handle more than 400 pieces of bleached fabrics and coarse fabrics. On the 14th, 370 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Dongbu: The market situation is stable, with minimal ups and downs. White goods and fine fabrics are still soft. The closing price of Longtou Factory's single-unit stack was 44.6 yuan. However, the Tussah silk gabardine was hoarded by hoarders, and the price continued to be firm. The evening closing price was 1.445625 yuan, a rise of 5 li per yard.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Stable

Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's clearing: the latest goods of the Outer Bank for 24 coarse white were 91 yuan to 92 yuan and 3 jiao, and then fell back slightly to 91.5 yuan. There were also goods arriving in March and April at 90 yuan, 91 yuan, 91.5 yuan, then to 90.05 yuan to 90 yuan. Taikoo B mark was 108 yuan, DY was 95 yuan, HK was 88.5 , Dutch Chiri was 7 yuan, 69 yuan to 71 yuan, 70.05 yuan, old goods was 68 yuan, which was a good start of 5 jiao for the previous market's new coarse white. Old goods rose by 1.5 yuan. It was heard that the sugar market outside the market was still weak in coarse white. There were 1,500 bags of sugar coming from Hong Kong to Tianjin today. Yesterday, 3,500 white tons were transported from Java.

### Futures Sugar Settlement: Expected to Come to a Conclusion

Futures sugar settlement: The market price in this period fluctuates too much, and people's hearts are difficult to stabilize, so the executive supervisory committee of the association held a meeting to discuss a compromise, and the buyer and seller handed over the settlement to the association for summary. Most of them have been completed, and only a very small number have not sent the funds to the association. It is expected that they will be cleared in the near future. If so, the entire settlement is expected to come to a conclusion.

### Hardware: American Tinplate Very Popular, Prices Rise to 500 Yuan; Black Steel Billets Inventory Low

200-pound and 180-pound American double-joint tinplate are exceptionally strong, because the Tianjin gang of customers are enthusiastically scouring. The street's canning factories and printing factories are also actively purchasing. The opening price has risen again and again. Yesterday's market, such as 180 pounds per box, was sold from 460 yuan to 480 yuan, and 200 pounds of goods even rose from West 180 yuan to 500 yuan, a huge increase of 20 yuan each compared to before. Moreover, the flowing goods are very scarce, and wholesale transactions are temporarily impossible to collect.

Black steel billets: Due to the termination of overseas sources, the inventory in this city is scarce. After the manufacturers and traders in the street have successively transacted, the market is booming. The current goods are increasingly insufficient, and people's hearts are high, and the prices are also rising accordingly. Yesterday, a bundle of 2,000-pound new steel factory goods sold for 3,500 yuan, and a bundle of old steel factory goods required 3,600 yuan, which was more than 100 yuan higher than before.

### Coal: Tongdeli Coal Rebounds

Tongdeli white coal: After a foreign firm distributed it, it was rumored that a certain company, the old manager, also had new goods arriving. Traders and agents were about to compete, and the black market once fell. In recent days, it has still failed to see the facts, and people's hearts have recovered. Take advantage of the low price to buy in. The old order price opened at 432 yuan, and the price rose by more than 10 yuan. The current car is slightly cheaper than the disc.

### Medicinal Materials: Yaoqian Rises Sharply

Recently, due to the scarcity of the arrival and storage of Yaoqian, the inventory feels thin. At the same time, the sales side needs to be very active, so the price has risen again by 30 to 40 yuan. Yesterday's market prices, such as white-skinned Yaoqian, sold for 200 yuan, and red-skinned Qian also reached 169 yuan. The market situation is excellent.

### American Missionary Comes to Shanghai from the Provisional Capital: Says Chinese Popular Morale is Flourishing, Not Afraid of Hardship, Possessing Unlimited Power, and Surely Able to Establish an Ideal New China

American missionary James recently arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing via Hong Kong. He expressed great optimism regarding the flourishing atmosphere of Free China, and firmly believed that the Chinese people would surely obtain true freedom and be able to establish an ideal new China. Yesterday, a Daguan News Agency reporter interviewed him at a certain inn, and he kindly told us the following:

Enduring Pain with Strong Will

"I (James referring to himself)," after going to Chongqing in the winter of the year before last, resided in a church next to a mountain more than ten miles from Chongqing. Behind the church was a Chinese hospital, mostly filled with wounded soldiers and innocent civilians who had been bombed. I made it a habit to inspect the hospital once a week and comfort the wounded soldiers. However, their willpower was extremely strong. They expressed great anger toward those who had harmed them, but put their own pain aside.

Construction Spirit is Astonishing

"One day, it was bombed by Japanese planes. At that time, I happened to be in the city and witnessed a giant bomb falling into a slum. All I saw was a blaze of fire, but the residents of the area had already scattered during the first air raid siren, so the deaths and injuries were minimal. Only a little over two hundred simple houses were destroyed. I felt deeply sorry for the rubble, but three days later, when I went to the city for the second time, I found over two hundred neat thatched houses there. There were no more broken walls or ruins. After inquiring, I learned that the residents of the area had taken away the destroyed wood after the Japanese planes left and planned the construction work that night. Their construction spirit and agile actions were truly admirable.

United Struggle with Absolute Brightness

Finally, Mr. James said, "If the people of the whole country can continue to unite and struggle under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, then the future is absolutely bright, the ideal new China will surely be born, and all abnormal conditions can also be eliminated. China is an old friend of mine of more than ten years. I firmly believe that my old friend can obtain true freedom, independence, and equality."

### The Public Works Department's Salary Increase Proposal for Employees: Seriously Considered, the Bureau Organizes a Special Committee for Research

Regarding the issue of salary increases for Public Works Department employees, the Public Works Department proposed it for discussion at the regular meeting on the 11th. The Personnel Committee's opinion was conveyed. In addition to agreeing with the employees' request, it also suggested a 20% salary increase for senior employees. All sectors of the city believe that last year, as a result of the Public Works Department's across-the-board salary increase in November, taxes were increased by 40%, increasing the burden on the entire city, stimulating rising prices, and affecting the spread and expansion of labor strikes, and repeatedly resulting in the Public Works Department's budget deficit this year. Therefore, they attach great importance to this issue and have issued statements asking the authorities to pay close attention to it. It is reported that at the meeting that day, in addition to expressing sympathy for the employees' demands, it was also deeply felt that this year's budget deficit was 9 million yuan, and loans had just been taken out to overcome the difficulties. If the employees' demands are followed, there will be no such funds, and what method will be used to increase revenue? If the burden on the citizens is increased again, it will inevitably cause public resentment. Therefore, it was decided to retain the proposal and organize a special committee to submit it for consideration. The tasks of the committee are: (1) to study ways to increase revenue, (2) to determine the proportion of salary increases, (3) to pay attention to the impact on the general society, and to submit a concrete plan for discussion after it is drafted. Yesterday, a Western newspaper reporter asked the Public Works Department spokesperson about this issue, and it was said that nothing could be announced on this matter at this time, but a formal announcement is expected to be issued soon.

### The Business Tax of Money Exchange Houses is Temporarily Approved for Reduction

According to the Public Works Department, regarding the request of money exchange businesses to reduce business tax, the bureau's board of directors has decided to approve the reduction of this business tax from 120 yuan per quarter (calculated according to the width of the storefront, 12 feet per section) to 75 yuan per quarter. On the one hand, this case will be left to the "New Tax Revenue Committee" for consideration. According to this, there are currently 69 such money exchange shops.

### Suspects in the Major Post Office Robbery Case are Requested to be Punished: The Stolen Money Has Not Yet Been Returned to the Post Office for Inventory

After the major post office robbery case was quickly solved by the Japanese Military Police, all of the stolen money, 2 million yuan, was recovered. However, the Japanese side is still holding the money. Currently, Okada, the chief inspector of the post office, is negotiating. Regarding the personnel of the Savings and Remittance Bureau who escorted the money, including Wang Xuchu, director of the cashier department, two bodyguards, and three old workers, are still detained at the former site of the Wing On Silver Company in Hongkou. The post office will report to the General Administration to impose penalties according to the circumstances.

Dr. Mingdan will also attend the discussion at that time.

### French Lawyer Dasang Died from a Stab Wound Yesterday Morning: Met an Assassin Beside the Escalator in His Office, Shot Three Times and Died in the Ambulance

French lawyer Dasang was suddenly assassinated on Rue du Consulat yesterday morning and died from his injuries in the ambulance. According to the French Concession, since the assassination of the legal advisor to the Gonghuang Bureau, Du Ge, this is the second such incident. The details of the case are recorded below:

Practicing Law for Thirty Years

French lawyer Rdauxionde Ruffe, 66 years old, from the Eure-et-Loir province of France, graduated from the Law Department of the University of Paris at an early age and obtained a doctorate in law. He once served as a judge in the Saigon Court. He came to Shanghai 30 years ago and practiced law as the first lawyer to appear in the French Concession court. His office was located on the second floor, Room 27, 41 Rue du Consulat, while his residence was at 54 Rue Massenet. He usually had a No. 11923 Buick car for transportation.

Hit by Three Bullets, All in Vital Parts

Yesterday morning, after breakfast, Mr. Dasang, wearing a beige suit and a rattan hat, left his house after 8:30 and took a car directly to his office to work as usual. When the car arrived at the entrance of No. 41, it was exactly 9 o'clock. Mr. Dasang opened the door and walked into the building, walking up the stairs. Unexpectedly, four men were already lying in ambush. One of them was waiting beside the stairs. Seeing Mr. Dasang coming up, he took out a pistol and fired three shots at Mr. Dasang, all hitting him in the chest. He immediately fell to the blood pool beside the stairs, barely breathing.

Old and Weak, Died Halfway

When the nearby police officers received the news, they urgently telegraphed the police station and dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene. A temporary curfew was imposed around the scene of the incident for a strict search. However, the shooter had already fled far away after the incident, and no one was caught at the same time. Senior French police officers, such as General Supervisor Fa Bo'er and Criminal Minister Wan Langdeng, also personally visited the scene after the incident. Mr. Dasang was unable to speak. He was rushed onto an ambulance and sent to Guangci Hospital for emergency treatment. However, Mr. Dasang was old and weak, and he lost too much blood and died in the car.

Dasang's Body Sent to the Morgue

After the incident, the French police transferred the body to the Tarast Road morgue for autopsy. Because the case was serious, the French police immediately summoned Jiang Rongtang, the tea servant of Mr. Dasang's office, to the police station for questioning to provide clues. One bullet shell was sent to an expert for examination. At noon, personnel were sent to temporarily seal off Mr. Dasang's office. It is reported that Mr. Dasang's eldest daughter currently lives in Qingdao, and his partner works at the Banque Belge pour l'Étranger in Shanghai. In addition to having a No. 11923 car, Mr. Dasang also has a No. 615 car.

Ms. Meiding Witnessed the Incident

According to the news from the English-language Great American Evening Post, Ms. Meiding, an employee of the Shanghai French Daily, was also on the scene when the incident occurred. She heard Mr. Dasang groan and say, "Those people fired a shot and hit my neck." Meiding asked if she had seen the perpetrator. He replied, "I don't know who fired the shot." After speaking, his breath was as weak as a thread. After a while, the patrolmen arrived after hearing the alarm and summoned an ambulance to rush Mr. Dasang to Guangci Hospital, where he died on the way. The police were able to disclose the motive for the case this morning. Mr. Dasang has lived in China for more than 40 years, mostly in Shanghai. He often wrote articles for English and French "Far East" magazines. Mr. Dasang was born in Paris in 1878. After graduating from the Sorbonne University, he practiced law and served as a judge in Saigon. He joined the army during World War I and participated in major battles such as Verdun. He was awarded a military medal. After the war, he returned to Shanghai and resumed his legal practice. He once served as the chairman of the Shanghai French Veterans Association. He wrote many books on Far Eastern events and Sino-French art. He once served as a Far Eastern reporter for the French Figaro newspaper.

### US Requisition of Ships: No Immediate Impact, Sailing Schedules of President Liners Remain Valid, Detailed Plans for Ship Requisition Still Under Study

An official of the American President Lines said yesterday that the news agency reported that the US government requisitioned passenger ships sailing to the Far East. Shanghai has some concerns about shipping between the Far East and the North American Pacific coast. This may be an overreaction. The news agency's report can undoubtedly express the general situation, but it cannot be considered reliable.

Ships Sailing to Shanghai Will Not Suddenly Decrease

In addition to seeing what the news agency reported, the Shanghai American President Lines has not received any confirmed news that its business will be reduced. Therefore, the current sailing schedules of the ships remain valid, and tickets are still being sold as usual without reservation. It is indeed a fact that the government has taken over merchant ships, and there is no doubt about it. The American President Lines will certainly be affected. However, it is expected that at least in the short term, the number of ships sailing to Shanghai will not suddenly decrease.

Ship Requisition Methods Have Not Yet Been Determined

The company is well aware that the US officialdom's reaction to the world situation will involve the shipping industry in the Far East. Therefore, it is now waiting for concrete news from the San Francisco headquarters. The fact that it has not yet received this concrete news shows that the detailed methods of the ship requisition plan have not been drafted. It may be inevitable that the US ship sailing to the Far East will be subject to some restrictions in the future. However, the personnel of the President Lines in Shanghai believe that even if it is affected, it will not be very large. Other shipping companies have already shouldered the pressure of the government's requisition of ships, and the President Lines cannot afford to lose a single ship now. Unless there is a serious emergency, its business will not be reduced.

Tickets for Ships are Still Being Booked as Usual

Moreover, the loss of ships in recent times has been unprecedented, and all countries are fighting for survival. Therefore, anything can happen. For example, the "Empress" class mail ship of the Changxing Company, which usually sails to the Far East, has been suspended since Christmas. All ships have been requisitioned by the British authorities. Personnel of the President Lines said that it is too early to draw conclusions. So far, no official news has been received. Therefore, the company's tickets are still being booked as usual, and major changes are not expected in the near future.

### Special Theater Tickets are Exempt from Entertainment Tax

According to the announcement of the Public Works Department, special tickets issued by theaters in the concession to personnel wearing uniforms are exempt from entertainment tax.

### Former President of St. John's University, Bu Fangji, Returned to the United States Yesterday: Dedicated 52 Years to Education in China, Alumni Warmly Saw Him Off with Deep Regret

Dr. Bu Fangji, the former president of St. John's University in Shanghai, returned to the United States yesterday morning with his wife on the President Cleveland. Dr. Bu has been responsible for the school affairs of St. John's University since 1888 until he retired on February 1 this year, and was succeeded by Vice President Shen Siliang. Mr. Bu has traveled to China for 52 years, and he is usually enthusiastic about education and has devoted much effort to the cultivation of young people, and he is kind and amiable in dealing with people, and he is respected by people. He was born in New York, USA on February 22, 1864. In his early years, he studied at New York's Trinity School, Columbia University, and New York's Theological Seminary. In 1888, he came to China to engage in missionary work, and then he founded St. John's University, with many students and outstanding achievements. He married twice. His first wife was a Chinese woman surnamed Huang, who died of illness, and then he remarried. Mr. Bu is quite researched in Chinese, and he has written many books over the years, which have been widely circulated. He has four children. His eldest son, James, also accompanied him back to the United States yesterday. At 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the New Customs pier was crowded with people. His friends and students from all walks of life went to say goodbye to this friend of China. Mr. Bu and his wife and son shook hands with the well-wishers one by one and briefly talked about their parting feelings. Mr. Bu is over 70 years old, but he is energetic and comparable to a young man. When the whistle sounded, Mr. Bu and others boarded the ship with smiles and waved their handkerchiefs back, as if they were reluctant to leave.

Dr. Bu Fangji, who left Shanghai yesterday

### Amateur Sports Association Farewell to Zha Ruilong to Go Abroad

The Shanghai Amateur Sports Research Association was founded by people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about sports. It has always published sports books and held body-building exercises. It has made many contributions to promoting mass sports. Now, the chairman of the association and martial artist Zha Ruilong will go abroad again at the invitation of Chao Chao-chun, a wealthy overseas Chinese in the Philippines. Therefore, a banquet was held at the Dadong Restaurant the other day to say farewell. Those present included Feng Zhiyin, Yang Lin, Shi Zhengzhong, Wang Zehuai, and other 50 people. They toasted and talked, and the hosts and guests had a good time. They dispersed at about 10 o'clock.

### A Record of the Artist Zhang Chongren

— Shao

The artist Zhang Chongren is extremely accomplished. He studied in France and Belgium at an early age and graduated from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels with first place. He won the Albert Gold Medal from the Belgian King, which brought glory to the country. The Chinese Embassy in Belgium specially awarded him the Sanji Medal to encourage him. His solo exhibition upon returning to China caused a sensation in the Chinese art world. Xu Langxi, the principal of the Xinhua Art College at the time, and other famous figures in the art world went to evaluate his works. Seeing his sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and pencil works, all of which were extremely accomplished, he exclaimed: "This is an all-rounder in the art world." At that time, Wu Tiecheng, Sun Ke, Cai Jiemin, Ye Gongchuo, Huang Hanliang, and other art lovers came to visit and competed to buy his paintings, and all of his works were snatched up.

After this exhibition, Zhang buried himself in the studio again, living in seclusion. He never carelessly completed a painting by accumulating paintings. Once a painting was completed, it must be purchased and collected by a private individual. As a result, he has not held a solo exhibition in the past five years. Fellow art lovers urged each other, and had no choice but to repeatedly collect the sculptures and paintings scattered in Shanghai, and publicly exhibited them at the Xiqingnianhui on Jing'an Temple Road (next to the International Hotel) from June 15 to 19. According to Zhang, "I feel it is troublesome to have an exhibition every five years." This is really an opportunity for art lovers to feast their eyes on a collection of masterpieces in one place. The picture above is Zhang's oil painting "Compassion". When the author stands in front of the painting, he suspects that he is the person in the painting. It can be imagined that the painting is lifelike.

### Summer Hygiene Campaign

The Summer Hygiene and Health Campaign sponsored by the YMCA officially opened at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the Baixianqiao venue.

There were physical examinations and health lectures in the afternoon, and entertainment and movies in the evening. The meeting will last for three days and will close at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

### Hong Kong's Rice Supply to Shanghai to Change to Mintang Rice: But the Public Works Department Has No Official Statement, Its Selling Price May be Further Reduced

According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, reporters learned from foreign firms yesterday that foreign firms in Shanghai received telegrams from their counterparts in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government, in view of the fact that the route of Yangon small-grain rice has become wider and the inventory has decreased slightly, but the Mintang rice has a continuous source and a weak route, so the inventory is abundant. It has ordered a temporary ban on the transfer of small-grain rice to other places, but Mintang rice is allowed to be exported in large quantities. The special Yangon small-grain rice directly supplied by the Hong Kong government to the Shanghai Public Works Department is also in the prohibited list. The Hong Kong government has telegraphed the Shanghai Public Works Department that the Pingmi (stabilized price rice) shipped to Shanghai in the future will be changed to Yangon Mintang foreign rice, and the first batch can be loaded and shipped to Shanghai in July. According to rice industry sources, the last batch of special Yangon small-grain rice supplied by the Hong Kong government will arrive here on the 19th of this month. However, the Public Works Department has not officially stated the above points to the outside world. According to general people, the authorities may find a way to suppress the selling price of Mintang rice in Shanghai again.

Pingmi is Not Being Sold

The Public Works Department is holding Yangon special Mintang rice. The rice sample was brought to Shanghai from Hong Kong the other day and stored in the Liji and Xiangmao foreign firms for the rice industry to observe the color when ordering. It has now begun to order. According to shipping industry sources, the Fusheng ship, which arrived at the port at 10 a.m. yesterday, carried 10,000 bags of flat-price small-grain rice and berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf. In addition, the Yuansheng, Yusheng, Taiyuan, and Ninghai ships, each carrying 10,000 bags of flat-price small-grain rice, will also arrive at the port in the next few days. Recently, it was heard that some unscrupulous people used the name of the Pingmi agency staff to go to various rice shops to sell certain goods at a high price. A few rice shops have purchased them because it is difficult to refuse a favor. There have been more than 20 cases. Until yesterday, the Pingmi agency staff began to realize it. It is heard that they have generally notified the rice shops, stating that the Pingmi agency staff have not been selling any goods outside, and hope that the rice shops will not be fooled again.

Rice Truck Workers Arrested

Daguan News Agency said that the transport of rice in Shanghai was mediated by the Political Department of the Public Works Department, stipulating that small quantities of rice should be transported by small carts, and large quantities should be transported by trucks in four out of ten cases. Those who are far away are also transported by trucks. The truck and small cart industries have jointly formed a soybean and rice industry transportation cooperative to prevent disputes and rice grabbing incidents. So far, it has been peaceful for months. However, on June 6, the investigators of the co-op were monitoring vehicles transporting goods on the Erbai Du Bridge, when they were suddenly beaten and humiliated by the Chinese police. On the afternoon of the 10th, when vehicles were loading goods at No. 2 Wharf on the Bund of Wuma Road, four people were arrested for as long as eight hours, and the armbands approved by the Political Department were detained. They were returned after negotiation the next day. Yesterday, the resident police at Wharf No. 1 refused to allow the small carts to approach the wharf to load goods, and detained 23 small carts and 23 workers in the police station, and sentenced them to fines. All the small cart workers had asked the Rice Shop Association, the Soybean and Rice Shop Association, and the Political Department for instructions yesterday. If a satisfactory solution is not obtained, they want to strike again.

Investigation of Rice Storage in Warehouses

According to the report of the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association yesterday, the survey of rice storage in the 118th issue (from last Thursday to this Thursday) has been officially completed. A total of more than 90 Chinese and foreign rice warehouses stored 1,087,877 bags of rice. The rice storage is limited to Chinese and foreign warehouses. As for the rice sold at the door of rice shops, the rice stored by residents, and the rice that has been ordered by various civil food organizations and transported to Shanghai, they have not been investigated. It is estimated that the total amount of rice is about 850,000 to 60,000 bags, so the total amount of domestic and foreign rice in the city must be more than 1.9 million bags.

### Generous Donations to the New Puyutang: Enthusiasm From All Walks of Life Undiminished, More Than 70,000 Yuan Still Lacking This Year, Still Hoping That Readers of This Newspaper Will Continue to Donate

The New Puyutang in Nanshi is a famous Catholic charitable organization. It has a nursery, an orphanage, an old folks' home, and a disabled people's home, accommodating nearly a thousand orphans, elderly, and disabled people. Under the leadership and education of the Sisters of Charity, it is no different from a paradise for the poor, sick, orphaned, and helpless. However, since the outbreak of the war, donations have decreased sharply, and supplies have increased sharply due to the soaring prices. Those who have been accommodated cannot be repatriated, and those who should be accommodated cannot bear to be rejected. Therefore, it is becoming more and more difficult and almost impossible to continue. After this newspaper sent staff to visit the site, it felt that such arduous work should not be allowed to stop. Therefore, it appealed to the readers of this newspaper. For several months, it has been generously responded to by all walks of life. From January to April, more than 100,000 yuan in donations has been received (detailed in this newspaper on May 12). The donation report for May is now prepared by the church and summarized as follows:

Donation Results

In May, a total of 11,270.8 yuan in donations were received, 4,600 yuan in fixed monthly donations, and 5,314 yuan in donations in kind, totaling 21,188.8 yuan. Among them, Yu Ziying, Yuan Yang'an, and Yi Jun's fundraising by Wang Jun of 3,000 yuan was the largest. Mr. Lü Guicong and his children visited the church and assumed a monthly donation of 50 yuan, which is commendable. The detailed list of donors and amounts will be published in this newspaper by the church at the end of August for combined thanks.

Expenditure Report

In May, 15,200 yuan was spent on food, 2,879.48 yuan on vegetables, 597.96 yuan on water, 678 yuan on coal, 408 yuan on clothing, 298 yuan on medicine, 1,312 yuan on repairs, 900 yuan on kerosene, 683 yuan on wages, and 199 yuan on transportation, totaling 23,155.44 yuan. Among them, the food can be used until the end of August, and the kerosene can be used until the end of the year.

Looking Forward to Continued Donations

The current situation of the church is slightly better than before, but it is still far from being stable. According to the budget, there is a shortfall of more than 70,000 yuan this year. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that enthusiastic readers will continue to donate generously. Those who have not donated will donate generously, and those who have donated will donate again. Funds and goods are urgently needed. The amount of the donation is appreciated. The places to receive donations are: (1) Savings Bank Trust Department, 460 Hankou Road, (2) Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, Sassoon House on the Bund, (3) Jihuatang Pharmacy, 47 Yunnan Road, (4) Huamei Pharmacy, 156 Fuzhou Road, (5) Catholic Church, Catholic Church Street. The places to receive donations in kind are: (1) Catholic Church, Catholic Church Street.

### Procedures for Passports from Shanghai to the British Burma(Today's Myanmar) Yangon

The number of travelers from Shanghai to Hong Kong to Yangon or transferring to the mainland is increasing. The Burmese government's inspection procedures are extremely strict. Often, travelers are detained or punished due to non-compliance, or even sent back on the original ship. According to the China Travel Service, the procedures for travelers to Myanmar are: (1) Obtain a passport from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, (2) At the same time, forward it to the Passport Department of the Hong Kong government for approval by the Burmese Ministry of Interior, (3) After the Burmese government approves it, the applicant must submit a "Visa Application Form" to the Passport Department, and the Department will reissue the review notice. The application form and passport should be sent to the Chinese Civil Affairs Department and sent directly to the Passport Department. After three days, the applicant can go to the Passport Department to request a visa. After the procedures are completed, they must carry a smallpox and epidemic prevention certificate before purchasing a ship ticket.

### Shanghai Silver Shops are Developing Abnormally: More Than 40 Have Been Established This Year

The Shanghai silver shop industry has recently shown an abnormal development trend. New establishments are springing up like mushrooms after rain. Before the war, there were only more than 30 silver shops in the city. Now, the number has increased to 140 or 150, and there are no fewer than 70 or 80 silver shops that have not joined the association. That is, in the first half of this year, the number of newly established silver shops has increased to about 40. In recent days, there are still five or six silver shops that are being prepared and will be opened soon.

### Trolley Passenger Dies Innocently

At 2:10 PM the day before yesterday, an unidentified man, Mr. A, around 40 years old, wearing a Xiangyun gauze shirt and black Guangdong silk shorts, holding a piece of fresh meat, was riding a trailer of Shanghai French Tramways Company Route 1, No. 81, traveling from Xavia Road westward to eastward. When the trolley reached the front of No. 442, the man was dozing off, when suddenly a commotion arose in the car. Passengers rushed to avoid something and as the car door was not tightly closed, passengers opened the door and escaped. The man, in his drowsiness, was jostled and fell out of the trolley, thus suffering injuries. He was sent to the hospital by the patrol station, where he died despite treatment. As the patrol station could not trace any family members, the body was sent to the coroner's office. After examination yesterday, the body was photographed and buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home, pending identification by relatives.

### Kidnapping for Ransom: Several Kidnappers Arrested and Detained

They were sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. An investigation revealed that Liu and others had committed two kidnapping cases: (1) On October 12th of last year, at 12:45 PM, Huang Xuanping, manager of the Northern Inspection Company, was kidnapped on Hart Road (Huang was kidnapped inside his private car, No. 546), and a ransom of one million yuan was demanded. The kidnappers were eventually paid 43,000 yuan. (2) On April 23rd of this year, at 12:15 PM, Yu Jingqi, the sixteen-year-old son of Yu Shen Qifang, residing at No. 6, Lane 775, Julida Road, was kidnapped in front of the Moore Memorial Church School at No. 316 Yu Qiaqing Road (also kidnapped inside his private car, No. 13351), and a huge ransom was demanded. The kidnappers were eventually paid 110,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened court to hear the case. The defendants retained lawyers Wang Yaotang, Fan Gang, and Yu Enliang to defend them. The patrol station's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, prosecuted them for the crime of kidnapping for ransom and also accused them of robbery, as the defendants had allegedly committed two other robbery cases. After questioning by Judge Feng, an order was issued for continued detention pending a future hearing.

### The Indirect Bomber

— Xiao Yun

A few months ago, when relations between the United States and Germany were deteriorating, the German side, in an attempt to please the Americans, invited American citizens through shortwave radio broadcasts to express any opinions to the German government, with the German side paying the telegram fees. Unexpectedly, many Americans took advantage of this convenience to harshly criticize the German government, with one telegram hoping for Hitler's early funeral. This shows a glimpse of the resentment in people's hearts.

Recently, Americans have taken a more imaginative approach to aid Britain, organizing a "Bombers Ltd.," which has special connections with British bomb manufacturers. Any American citizen who wants to quickly bomb Germany can go to "Bombers Ltd.," choose an aerial bomb, pay the bomb fee, and specify that the British Royal Air Force bring the bomb to Germany and drop it. After the British Air Force personnel drop the selected bomb, they send a receipt by airmail, thanking the indirect bomber, explaining that the bomb has been dropped, and specifying the time and place of the bombing.

This is indeed a novel wartime business. However, these indirect bombers have existed since ancient times, because in our lives, we are all invisibly indirect bombers, some bombing for the forces of light and good, while others bombing for the forces of darkness and evil.

Science

### Scientific Methods of Killing

— Xiu

The smell of gunpowder not only permeates the human world but has also extended to the animal kingdom. In some provinces of the United States, a type of crow called the white-beaked crow is a nuisance to the countryside and is extremely detestable. Farmers cannot eradicate them using ordinary bird-killing methods, so they have learned group slaughter methods from the European fires of war. They bury several time bombs in the trees where these pest birds roost, and the effect is excellent. When these "thugs" who like to caw loudly are sleeping peacefully, the bombs suddenly explode, and a flock of pest birds is reduced to nothing.

A certain African chief once borrowed a submarine from the British government, specifically for laying mines to exterminate crocodiles. Crocodiles are a scourge in his territory, so he also wants to rely on gunpowder for group slaughter.

The high-intensity electric furnace can kill mosquitoes, which is a discovery. When this electric furnace is turned on, it emits a humming sound that travels far. Large numbers of mosquitoes, attracted by the sound, gather like moths to a flame and rush to their deaths on the electric furnace. All the mosquitoes burned to death are male, because the sound emitted from the electric furnace is exactly the same as the mating call of female mosquitoes. In view of this fact, the United States Public Health Service has created a special mosquito-killing device, shaped like a radio, that emits a buzzing sound that is twice as loud, causing amorous male mosquitoes to throw themselves into the net.

An engineer, at the request of a mushroom farmer, invented a "fly-suction fan." Flies, smelling the odor of fertilizer, fly to the place where mushrooms are grown and are sucked in by the fan, leaving them with no way out. The inventor also installed a "cold air ring" on the fan to freeze the flies, causing them to fall into an iron can. He provides these frozen flies to frog farmers, which can be said to be a good use of waste.

Among all kinds of pests, locusts are probably the most hateful. Swarms of locusts block out the sun, and when they land, they quickly eat up the crops for several miles around. Sometimes a swarm of locusts can gather into a patch ten miles wide and twenty miles long. How astonishing is their number! Unfortunately, they can also die from firearms. The firearm used to kill locusts is the "flamethrower" used by the German army in the past to attack the British army on the Flanders battlefield. A light and portable cylinder filled with paraffin wax is installed on the back. A leather tube is attached to the cylinder, with a nozzle at the end. After the cylinder is filled with expanding gas, flames are sprayed from the nozzle, reaching up to ten yards. The locusts are violently sprayed by the roaring flames, leaving corpses everywhere. Killing locusts with sweet bran containing arsenic is also very effective. Locusts that eat the poisonous bran scattered on the ground will not jump as usual on the first day, lose direction and become paralyzed on the second day, and die on the third day.

A person driving a car unintentionally discovered a clever way to kill snakes. After his car stopped, a poisonous snake suddenly bit the tire, its terrible fangs piercing the tire. Unexpectedly, before its fangs could be pulled out, its abdomen was filled with gas leaking from the tire, causing it to burst and die.

### A Little Self-Confidence

— Shi Di

Perhaps my soul is fragile. Sad people often say with a sentimental and poetic tone, "You are a very sensitive person!"

No matter how clumsy the player is, as long as he plucks a string, a faint sound will be produced. It can accuse, it can show that he still has a bit of life force, it can vent his emotions, it can immerse his soul in the middle. Why not become beautiful music, and why bother seeking the appreciation of the general public?

It may not resonate on my heartstrings, perhaps I simply don't understand (how pitiful!), I believe that's what he wants to say, therefore his words will be equally respected by me.

Although I am pitifully stupid, I am not prepared to admit it completely, because I still have a little self-confidence, believing that I still have a little of the "correct" component. I am prepared to live in this little self-confidence.

A little self-confidence is not stubbornness or conservatism. In the eyes of the wise, it is naturally still "pitiful," but for those with this little self-confidence, it will always be regarded as a treasure.

I once looked up at the early summer night sky, letting the coolness seep into my shoulders. Maybe I will feel a burning sensation on my forehead in the middle of the night, and tomorrow will bring a cough. I am still willing to do this often, because I saw the twinkling of the stars in the quiet night and appreciated the profound beauty. I also seem to understand this mystery.

So in the dream of this night, I wove a blue-colored vision, groping in the darkness. I received the faint guidance of starlight.

It is said that young people always can't escape a beautiful vision, without the ability to analyze it deeply. But I think it won't be wrong, although no one can objectively point out whether that vision is scarlet, blue, gold, or without any color.

No one is urging, and no one is forcing, like the leaping of a river, there is no force that can stop its progress.

There will be setbacks, but you believe that the power of this reaction will unleash such great ability!

I am willing to caress my wounds, wipe away my tears, and come again!

That's the little bit of self-confidence I have.

### Begonia

(9) A Strange Farmer

Begonia furrowed his brows and sat on a bench, staring blankly at the kerosene lamp.

He remembered when he deposited these two sums of money into the Dong Province Colonial Bank and the Fuhua Bank, several people had advised him that these two banks had too deep a relationship with those warlords and politicians, and that they would easily be affected in the future. But at that time, he regarded Yuan, the garrison commander and his nephew, as close relatives, and hearing that they often associated with important military figures from these two banks, he finally deposited the money without hesitation. Later, when he talked to Xiangqi about this matter, she also felt it was inappropriate, but the term had not yet expired, and she was embarrassed to ask Shaowen to take it out for him first. Unexpectedly, he was now regretting it!

"Dad, you said you would send me to school in town after the New Year. Just now the old man told me that our family will be eating sweet potato porridge again in a few days.... Dad, when are you going to buy me a schoolbag?" Meibao carefully hid the photo album and sat on the edge of the kang, her tired little eyes wide open, looking at her father's back and asking.

Begonia didn't hear her. The bank's matter had made him lost in thought.

"Dad, why aren't you talking?" Meibao immediately put on her leather shoes and walked to Begonia's face, leaning against his knees, looking up at her father's ugly face.

"Good girl, it's getting late, go to sleep first!" He gently picked up Meibao and walked to the warm kang.

Meibao smiled foolishly at him all the way, taking off her coat herself, while Begonia watched distractedly.

"Sleep well, child!" (132)

### Air Raid Warning Signals

— Ke Zhong

People in Shanghai have probably noticed that there is a very thin and tall building on Avenue Edward VII by the Bund, which is the signal tower of the Observatory. Whenever a hurricane is approaching, a warning signal is hoisted on this tower so that ships in the port can prepare in time and move to a safe area.

Recently, Germany has also used similar equipment to supplement air raid warnings. In the city, the sound of sirens reporting air raids can be heard by anyone, but people in the suburbs have no way of hearing them. Therefore, they have set up air raid warning posts near gas stations on the highways, so that gas station employees can hoist the air raid warning signal when they receive the alert. People in cars on the highway can clearly see this yellow and blue signal and know that there is an air raid.

### Innovation in Eastern Spoken Drama

— Xi Di

The Oriental Spoken Drama Theater, starting today (14th), has joined hands with the Huaxia Drama Society to perform new-style spoken drama in a popular form. This major change, this new reform, undoubtedly illuminates the future of the drama movement. Naturally, we welcome those experienced actors of the civilized drama with great talent to gradually approach spoken drama. At the same time, we are also extremely willing for those viewers of civilized drama with potential influence to gradually recognize spoken drama. One aspect is the self-training of the actors, and the other is the improvement of the audience's level. That news will make anyone who hears it very happy.

Orient has always been hovering between civilized drama and spoken drama. For six years, under the planning of Guan Jian, the director of the drama department, more than 200 plays have been performed, with more than 800 stage performances. Most of them are tragicomedies that cater to ordinary audiences, such as *Interpreting Flowers*, *Red Apricot Out of the Wall*, and *Spring Breeze Dreams*. They are very popular, but strictly speaking, they are far from the level of spoken drama and are very backward. Therefore, this major change, this new reform, is good news for the entire spoken drama circle.

At the beginning of the reform, they are still an adventurous attempt. In order to promote the enthusiasm of this movement and also take into account the various obstacles in the environment, they decided to invite a large number of directors and actors from the film and drama circles to participate. Playwrights and drama critics such as Huang Lu, Mao Yu, and Jiang Liu also took on the roles of writers and directors. As for the existing outstanding actors such as Song Xiaotian, Xuan Qiwu, Wu Taixu, and Dan Saiwen, they will still be retained for cooperation.

The currently planned plays are:

(1) *An Ideal Husband*, (2) *Love and Hate*, (3) *Newlyweds*, (4) *Hypocrisy*, (5) *The Rouge Shop*, (6) *The Rampant of Human Desire*, (7) *Life Events*, (8) *In the Night of Joy*, (9) *Money Tree*, (10) *The Phantom of the Opera*.

Each play will be changed every five days. It is planned to finish performing them in fifty days.

Regarding the results of this experiment, it still depends on their own efforts and the cooperation and help of all sectors of society. The reporter also sincerely hopes that the drama workers in the Orient can indeed bury their heads in hard work, not be afraid of difficulties, not retreat, and always remember the mission they shoulder.

Every Ten Chapters: Gongsun's Sword Qi, Part One

Xu Jing thought to himself that although Liu Yining's martial arts were good, he was always a bit shy when he saw a family, like a daughter. If he were a woman, wouldn't he be a character like Hongfu Nu? After a moment, Liu Yinying returned to his room. Servants were already there to serve him. After washing and grooming, the two went out to see Wang Yongtai and had breakfast together. Wang Yongtai said to Xu Jing, "Now that the misunderstanding between us has been eliminated and the harlot is dead, there is no need to dwell on the past. Please stay at my house. It's inconvenient to go back and forth if you live in the mountains. General Zhou's yamen will also need you to go there every day. Now you can't pretend to be sick anymore." Xu Jing looked at Liu Yinying's profile and said, "I've lived in the mountains for a few days and find mountain life very enjoyable. Since you, uncle, are kind, how dare I disobey? How about I go to Weifeng Mountain with Liu Jun and chat for a few days, then go down the mountain?" Wang Yongtai could only say, "That's fine." Liu Yinying said, "If General Zhou has a summons, he can send someone to the house at any time. I and Xu Jing will definitely obey." Wang Yongtai said, "Very good." The two said goodbye to Wang Yongtai and returned to Weifeng Mountain. Liu Yinying told his aunt about seeing General Zhou. His aunt told him to go down the mountain less and recuperate quietly in the mountains, firmly keeping Xu Jing to accompany her nephew for a long time. Therefore, although Xu Jing had been proven innocent, Wang Yongtai still wanted him to stay, but he found the time in the mountains very enjoyable and didn't want to leave. Every day, he and Liu Yinying walked on the mountain peaks, wrote papers under the windows, drank wine in front of the lamp, and danced with swords in the garden. The two were like magnets attracting iron, sharing the same goals and interests and becoming good friends. Before they knew it, another seven days had passed. On this day, Xu Jing was about to go down the mountain to see Wang Yongtai. In the morning, he and Liu Yinying stood under a big tree in front of the gate, enjoying the cool breeze and the mountain scenery. Suddenly, they heard the sound of bells, and an official rode a horse up the mountain. Recognizing that the official was General Zhou's confidant, they quickly greeted him. As soon as the official saw Xu Jing, he reined in his horse, jumped off his saddle, wiped the sweat from his head with one hand, and said, "Okay, I found you. General Zhou has a letter here, please General Xu go down the mountain immediately." Xu Jing couldn't help but be stunned when he heard this. The official took out a letter from his arms and presented it, saying, "You two are having fun in the mountains, but you don't know that the bandits already have a vanguard coming to attack Daizhou City." When the official said this, his face was very nervous, and his voice trembled a little. It turned out that the clouds of war had enveloped Daizhou City, and a great battle with blood rain and swords was about to begin. (89) End of Chapter Ten
