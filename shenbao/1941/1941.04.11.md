Belgian and Dutch diplomats have also been granted Soviet visas, planning to travel to India via the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 10th)

London - During questioning in the House of Commons, Mr. Dalton stated that since March 1st, very little Soviet oil had reached Germany, but it was too early to say that oil shipments had stopped altogether. (Reuters, 10th)

### Balkan War Situation Worsens: British and German Forces to Clash Head-On; Germany Plans to Cross North Africa and Advance on Egypt; Britain Makes Large-Scale Preparations to Cope with Events

London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that the vanguard of the German forces has entered Salonika, not only capturing the principal city of Macedonia but also dividing the Greek forces in the war zone into two. Several divisions of Greek troops in the regions of Serres and Eastern Macedonia may have surrendered. While those German forces are fighting in the south, other German troops have effectively cut across the "vital lines" of southern Greece and are now advancing from the northwest. The southern forces, now surrounded south of Old Seville, are in danger of being attacked from multiple sides. Meanwhile, some southern forces are attacking into Albania, tying down the Italian rear. Viewing the war situation, the latest developments in the Balkans must be regarded as serious. However, it is noteworthy that the German army has not yet attacked the British forces, indicating that the defense of Salonika is not part of the British plan, but the British forces should not be underestimated. Therefore, the outcome of the Balkan campaign is still uncertain. It is said that no British forces are present in the area east of the Vardar River, according to informed sources in London. (Reuters, 10th)

Athens - Under the pressure of Nazi troops, the Greek forces are both fighting and seemingly awaiting contact between British and German forces to initiate a full-scale war. According to a British spokesperson, British forces are currently making large-scale preparations to cope with any eventuality. They also stated, "It is impossible to predict when British forces will make contact with German forces." Regarding the Greek army's setbacks, the spokesperson said, "It is natural that the German army initially launched a fierce offensive because they had the advantage of choosing the timing. The situation is not entirely unfavorable and there are also favorable aspects." The British are closely monitoring the developments in Seville. The spokesperson said, "We have reason to believe that the people of Seville will not assist the Germans in their wickedness." (Associated Press, 10th)

New York - Yesterday, German mechanized forces shattered the southern part of Yugoslavia, captured Salonika in Greece, advanced rapidly into Greece, and will clash head-on with the British Expeditionary Force. They are also crossing North Africa to advance on Egypt. The astonishing achievements of the three-day blitzkrieg have engulfed the entire southern part of Serbia into the German territory, cutting off the main Yugoslav forces, leaving them vulnerable to piecemeal attacks. Greece is also experiencing a similarly unstoppable momentum, although they have not yet engaged in a major battle with the British forces. The German army now controls all of Macedonia east of Salonika. The Greek troops in that area have surrendered to the German army, and the German flag is raised high on the Aegean coast. At the same time, they are advancing south from the Vardar River basin in Yugoslavia, entering northern Greece, where they will engage in a major battle with the British main forces. The greatest danger to the British forces lies on their flanks. The German army plans to infiltrate Greece through the Florina area, attacking the British forces from the rear along the Greek road network. The number and strength of the British forces to resist the formidable German double-pronged attack are currently unknown. However, the British remain confident and their military equipment is plentiful. The fall of Salonika and Macedonia was originally expected by the British army, so all their deployments were planned with this scenario in mind. However, the British may not have anticipated the Germans cutting off southern Yugoslavia and the Italian forces in Albania so quickly. The German advance in Africa has been equally rapid. Italian newspapers have reported that German mechanized forces have reached Tobruk, only 80 miles from the Egyptian border. The German army heavily defeated the British army at Derna, capturing six British generals and 2,000 soldiers. In this situation, British Prime Minister Churchill told the House of Commons that the Nazis would launch earth-shattering actions. (Associated Press, 9th)

### Greek Forces in Eastern Macedonia Still Strongly Resisting

Athens - Officials announced today that while Salonika has fallen, the Greek forces in eastern Macedonia, which have been isolated, are still resisting strongly. This official statement denies the German High Command's claim that the trapped Greek forces have already surrendered. It was also stated that four German air squadrons attacked the port of Piraeus, the gateway to Athens, last night, but failed to cause any damage. This morning, the Greek High Command declared, "Even though the Greek forces in eastern Macedonia are in a difficult position after the fall of Salonika, our resistance on all fronts has not weakened in the slightest. According to reports from yesterday afternoon, our troops east of Salonika are still fighting." (Associated Press, 10th)

Berlin - Yesterday afternoon, the German side issued a special communique stating that after the German army advanced through Salonika, they broke through the Robel mountain pass. Another special communique stated that German mechanized and armored units have occupied the cities of Nis and Maribor in southern Yugoslavia. The German army has also occupied Xanthi (100 miles east of Salonika) and reached the Aegean coast, and is continuing to advance. (Reuters, 10th)

London - Last night, this location heard a broadcast from Athens radio stating that although German forces have occupied Salonika, Greek forces are still holding the defense line in eastern Macedonia. However, well-informed sources here estimate that in reality, the Greek teachers in Thrace and eastern Macedonia have been surrounded due to the German advance through Salonika. The main force of the Seville army has been defeated in northern Yugoslavia and is facing the danger of being surrounded. Athens radio also stated that German aircraft are dropping magnetic mines in Greek waters. It also stated, "On the Albanian front, the Italian offensive is only of a local nature, but it has been severely damaged and repulsed." Military circles here are extremely concerned about the situation in Greece and the Balkans. (Associated Press, 10th)

### German and Italian Forces Meet; Greek Forces Withdraw from Albania

Rome - At 9:00 PM last night (i.e., 3:00 AM Thursday Shanghai time), sources here reported that German and Italian forces have met in southern Yugoslavia. At the same time, a dispatch from Tirana stated that Greek troops have begun to withdraw from Albania into Greece. The Greek withdrawal is to avoid being cut off by German forces, who have recently been advancing towards the Albanian border from Macedonia and Salonika. Most Axis personnel here believe that the Greek forces will put up a major resistance north of Athens. It is believed that Greek, Australian, New Zealand, and British troops sent from Africa to Palestine will deter a large-scale German attack. The meeting point of German and Italian troops in southern Yugoslavia is near Bitola, located midway between Skopje and the Albanian border. It is understood that German and Italian mechanized units met there. Axis military observers believe that the Yugoslav army is completely isolated and that neither Greece nor Turkey can provide possible assistance on land. Observers believe that the war in Yugoslavia will become guerrilla warfare before the end of this weekend. (Associated Press, 10th)

London - According to sources here today, although the British Expeditionary Force in the Balkans has not yet engaged in combat, the British Air Force continues to provide unlimited assistance to both the Greek and Yugoslav armies. At the same time, according to the German High Command, the German army continues to advance on all fronts. After crossing the Vardar River, the German army in southern Yugoslavia is now approaching the eastern border of Albania. (Reuters, 10th)

### Rapid German Progress Astonishes U.S. Military Circles

Washington - U.S. Army authorities were quite astonished by the rapid German progress in the Balkans and were also skeptical as to whether organized Yugoslav resistance would immediately turn into guerrilla warfare. Army observers believe that if Yugoslavia can make contact with the Greek forces in Albania, they will adopt guerrilla tactics in the mountainous regions. Military authorities said that Britain may intend to build positions in southern Greece, as there are currently large numbers of British and Greek troops stationed there. They believe that although the superior German air force is a powerful aid to the German army, the southernmost part of Greece is very suitable for defensive warfare. They also believe that while Yugoslavia is still resisting, the British fleet will enter the Adriatic Sea to cut off Italian traffic, but this action may involve great danger. They also stated that the occupation of Massawa is very important because this fact clearly makes the Italian forces in East Africa lose resistance and allows more British troops to be transferred to Libya for combat. (Associated Press, 10th)

Berlin - German military experts stated that the Balkan campaign in the last three days has seen major battles. The results of the 9th were completely unexpected. The army commanded by German General List has now broken through Yugoslavia's border defense works. On the third day, the German army advanced 100 kilometers into Yugoslav territory, occupying Skopje, which is a railway hub in southern Serbia, connecting Nis and Belgrade in the north and Salonika directly to the south, and is connected to Bulgaria in the east. From this, it can be seen the importance of Skopje. After crossing the Vardar River, the German army has cut off the connection between the Yugoslav army and the British and Greek forces. The breakthrough of the Greek "Metaxas Line" further demonstrates the strength of the German soldiers' combat power, as the "Metaxas Line" was built in rugged mountains and equipped with the latest military equipment, making it difficult to attack. But it was eventually broken through by the mysterious German army. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)

### British Planes Roar, Fiercely Bombing German Forces

Athens - Officials stated that British fighters and bombers are continuously engaged in aerial combat and bombing for 24 hours a day to stop the German advance and assist the heroic Greek troops defending the mountain passes. This achievement is comparable to what the British Air Force did in the French war last year. The sound of British planes roaring can be heard almost all the time. New fighter groups and huge bomber groups come one after another, inflicting heavy punishment on the German mechanized teams in the narrow valleys. This attack by the British airmen was carried out after careful planning. They have been able to drop tons of heavy bombs on the German army passing through the mountain passes. As soon as a large squadron of fighters and bombers arrives here, they immediately fly into combat and begin their fierce attacks. However, the British Air Force's main and overall attack will be held until the appropriate time. In the military areas where the Greek forces are obeying the "defend or die" order and fighting vigorously, the British Air Force is attacking the fierce German forces with violent force, who are waiting for the opposing troops to scatter so that they can take the opportunity to launch a fierce attack. According to military authorities, the Greek army is engaging in a crazy, terrible, and unprecedented death battle. (Associated Press, 10th)

### Canadian Prime Minister To Visit The U.S. Soon

Canadian Federal Capital - Prime Minister Mackenzie King of the Cabinet recently said that although the situation in the Balkans is extremely serious, this situation is not enough to surprise those responsible for the military. I was originally scheduled to visit the United States, but due to the situation, the travel period may be postponed. However, I still wish to visit the United States, and I believe that President Roosevelt will also come here soon. (Havas, 10th)

### Italy Has Decided To Recall Ambassador To The U.S.

Mexico City - Responsible sources here recently announced that after the government detains several German and Italian ships staying in the Gulf of Mexico, diplomatic relations between Mexico and the Axis powers will soon be severed. (Havas, 10th)

Mexico City - Regarding the Mexican President's signing of the confiscation of German and Italian ships in Mexican ports, the German and Italian embassies in Mexico have not yet received a notice from the Mexican government as of noon today. Italian Minister to Mexico, Count Manchetti, plans to protest after receiving an official notice, as Italy has been negotiating with Mexico to exchange Italian oil tankers parked in Mexican ports for oil tankers built by Italian shipyards for Mexico. This approach is fair as there is no loss to either party. If Mexico arbitrarily confiscates Italian ships without compensation, it would be unfair. (Haitong News Agency)

Rome - Well-informed sources here recently said that Prime Minister Mussolini has decided to recall Prince Colonna, the ambassador to the United States. (Havas, 9th)

### Center Of War Has Now Shifted East; Rumors of Astounding Soviet Actions; Germany Claims Relations With Turkey Unchanged

Moscow - The Soviet Army's organ, Red Star, today published an article by Colonel Popov stating that the center of the war has shifted from west to east, and there is no need to talk about the German invasion of Britain anymore. Regarding the Balkan war, the article stated, "The German commander is now meeting a strong enemy." (Reuters, 10th)

London - The Exchange Telegraph Agency's dispatch from Ankara yesterday stated, "The Soviet Union will soon take astounding actions related to Germany's invasion of the Balkans." (Associated Press, 10th)

London - The Germans are now quietly deploying a large fifth column, preparing to mobilize it for the final operation against the Soviet Union. This fifth column is composed of "White Russians" who were officers in the Imperial Russian Army, as well as Ukrainians who oppose the current Soviet government. Germany is assuring the "White Russian" leaders that within a year, at the latest by next year, German mechanized divisions will thunder across Red Square in Moscow. It is said that when Germany organized this "White Russian" fifth column, it used the files of the French secret service, which contained a wealth of investigative documents detailing the thousands of Russians who had fled to France. These people have suddenly begun to enjoy a comfortable life, and the officers of the Imperial Russian Army are managing profitable businesses in the Imperial Army. All unemployed "White Russians" are invited to join the so-called "Free Corps," the purpose of which is unclear. Similar corps are currently being trained in Poland, commanded by [blank], a Ukrainian who opposes the Soviet Union. (International News Agency, 10th)

Ankara - Foreign Minister Saracoglu told the People's Party on Tuesday that the government will maintain [blank] Turkey is continuing to monitor developments affecting Turkish interests. (Reuters, 10th)

Turkish Capital - Political circles here commenting on the German-Greek war generally say that after the German army occupied Salonika and Thrace, Turkey's position has become extremely delicate. Salonika is the gateway to the Turkish Dardanelles Strait, and the Montreux Convention of 1936 stipulates that Turkey must guard the gateway to prevent the neutrality of the strait from being violated. At this point, the guarantees of various treaties are difficult to rely on. Currently, preparations are being intensified throughout Turkey to cope with any eventuality. The government has promulgated a new law raising the retirement age for officers to 65 and the retirement age for soldiers to 60. As for the other steps taken by the government, they have put the entire country in a state of general mobilization. Foreign visitors have received warnings that they will be at risk if they leak military information. The Turkish Foreign Minister met with the British, Greek, and Yugoslav ambassadors yesterday, and the People's Party held a special meeting to listen to the Foreign Minister's report on the current situation, with special emphasis on military and political aspects. (Havas, 10th)

Berlin - A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that Turkey's policy is probably based on its own interests. According to Berlin's observation, there will be no change in German-Turkish relations. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)

Editorial

### The Future of the Shanghai Concessions

What was in ancient times will not be repeated in modern times.

The scale and political system of the "city-states" of ancient Greece have long been praised by historians and political scientists of the past and even the present, but this system or scale will not be seen again in modern times. How could it? Although the European war is in progress, what kind of world will emerge after the war remains to be seen and cannot be predicted. However, up to now, this war has suggested a trend for international nations and cities that is exactly the opposite of the situation in ancient Greece, that is, nations must be larger and stronger to survive.

This is a digression. This digression was triggered by the recent apparent problems with the status of the Shanghai concessions. Because we firmly believe that everyone who is concerned about the Shanghai issue can clearly see and thoroughly understand that the fate of Shanghai is not determined by Shanghai itself but by the larger environment of Shanghai. Because of China's national power ninety-eight years ago, and because of the European zeal for colonization in the early nineteenth century, this monstrosity - Shanghai - was born. After nearly a century of international political and economic turmoil, Shanghai has grown to what it is today. This is by no means the realization of a plan created by the Chinese and foreign residents of Shanghai! For this reason, we firmly believe that no one wants to turn Shanghai into a city-state of ancient Greece. Talking about ancient Greece is just talk.

Those who feel that there have been problems with the status of the Shanghai concessions recently understand that Shanghai's fate depends on the larger environment. What they understand is correct, but what they feel is a misconception. Of course, we also know that it is not easy for everyone to be as objective about the historical reality they have witnessed as they are about understanding past history. Because the value of history is a long-term value, and short-lived natural persons often only use reality to evaluate it, so it is easy to have misconceptions. For example, regarding Shanghai, who among the Chinese and foreign residents of Shanghai today has witnessed the various events of the past ninety-eight years? It should be known that the precarious status of the Shanghai concessions over the past ninety-eight years and the sense of insecurity felt by the residents are not happening for the first time. Many foreign writers have humorous and profound descriptions of the situation at that time, but it has passed, and a period, a fragment, has completely passed. At present, some people think that the larger environment of Shanghai is different from what it was three or four years ago. Yes, there are some differences now; it was stable before and it is turbulent now. But it is still necessary to see clearly and think thoroughly that turbulence is only a temporary and partial abnormality, not the fundamental state. It must be that after the turbulence stops, even if it is no longer the fundamental state, it forms a normal state. What is meant by Shanghai's fate depending on the larger environment must be the normal larger environment. Therefore, in planning for Shanghai, it is still necessary to pool the wisdom and efforts of everyone to maintain the status quo of the Shanghai concessions in order to deal with the turbulence. Why rush to adapt to the temporary abnormal larger environment and lightly change things! As reported in yesterday's newspaper that the Municipal Council will submit Keats-Wei's proposal to this year's foreign taxpayer's meeting, we basically feel it is unnecessary.

Let's not talk about the fundamentals. Keats' proposal is to organize a temporary board of directors for the Shanghai Public Concession. Temporary means that it is not fundamental; the excuse that this case hopes to gain lies in "temporary." But regarding its content, such as the duties and powers, etc., let's not comment on it for the time being because it is "temporary." However, such as: (1) Clause B, which states that even if there is any conflict with the Land Regulations and their appendices, the organization should be formally and legally recognized as entirely legal; Clause C, which states that the temporary directors will hold office until they are legally elected or assumed; (2) The so-called temporary directors should, during their term of office, advise representatives of the residents of the Public Concession and the countries concerned to consider a municipal system that is more satisfactory than that stipulated in the current Land Regulations; and so on, not only does the so-called "law" according to law need to be clearly explained, but it also ignores the main body of the Land Regulations, and in terms of intent, it exceeds "temporary."

Regardless of the nature of temporary measures, we will not approve or oppose them for the time being. But the future of Shanghai will ultimately depend on the larger environment after the turbulence enters a normal state, this is inevitable. Therefore, we now also hope that the original proposer does not need to attach too much importance to this temporary measure.

### Victory at Qianjiang by Hubei Troops; Japanese Retreating to North Bank of Han River; Recovery of Qianzhou by An'yi and Nanhua Forces

Chongqing – This morning, all Chinese newspapers prominently reported in large characters the news that Qianjiang, an important town between Hankou and Yichang on the south bank of the Han River, had been recaptured by Chinese forces. According to a dispatch from the front lines in Hubei Province, after the Japanese army's defeat in the Yichang campaign in western Hubei, Chinese troops launched an offensive on Tuesday and recaptured Qianjiang.

Spokesman Discusses Jiangxi War Situation

Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman today reviewed the recent events in Jiangxi Province, stating that the Japanese army's failed offensives in Yichang and Nanchang last month prevented them from drawing troops from that area to other battle lines. The Japanese clearly wanted to eliminate the Chinese forces threatening Yichang and Nanchang in order to reduce their garrison there, but failed to achieve their goal, sacrificing many lives in vain. In the battles west of Nanchang, the ratio of Japanese to Chinese casualties was two to one, with the Japanese suffering 20,000 casualties. The heavy losses of the Japanese were contrary to other battlefields. The commander of the Chinese forces was Luo Zhuoying, and the commander of the left wing was Li Cui (transliteration). After the Chinese left wing was repelled, it turned back and attacked the flank of the Japanese central column. The Chinese central column, commanded by Wang Yaowu, blocked the main force of the Japanese army outside Shanggao. The Chinese right wing, commanded by Wang Tiehan (transliteration) and Wang Kejun, shattered the Japanese left wing's offensive and then attacked the flank of the Japanese central column. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

Inspection Notes from Northeast Shanggao

Shanggao – A reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday accompanied Generals so-and-so to inspect the battlefields in the northeastern area of Shanggao. When they reached Xia Yiqiao, about fifteen li northeast of Shanggao, they saw numerous bullet marks on the high ground near the Nie family, and the traces of battle remained. There were many Japanese corpses left on the ground. According to officers fighting in the area, the high ground was the only barrier protecting Shanggao County, so the Japanese and Chinese fought fiercely there. More than a thousand Japanese corpses were left on the ground. They then traveled another ten li or so and arrived at a small village, which was the Hua Jiang Ri He area. According to prisoners, Japanese Major General Iwanaga was wounded there by Chinese forces. Three li northeast brought them to Bi Jia, where the headquarters of the Japanese Oga Division Commander was located, with only a dozen houses. In each of the aforementioned locations, the Chinese captured a great many prisoners and buried many Japanese corpses in the surrounding areas. In short, the signs of the Japanese's disastrous defeat in the northeastern area of Shanggao were visible everywhere when inspecting the battlefield. (Dispatch, 9th)

(2) Guo Taiqi is specially appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. This order. (3) The late officer Gao Zhihang is posthumously awarded the rank of Anti-Japanese Major General. This order.

Appeasement Policy is a Thing of the Past

London – Ambassador Guo Taiqi held a farewell reception for reporters yesterday and gave a speech during the reception, stating that during the "September 18th Incident," appeasement was the most popular policy. However, currently, whether in Europe or Asia, the policy of appeasement has become a thing of the past. In the past, China was often regarded as an object of international policy, and no country was willing to cooperate with it. Currently, China's international status and its spiritual strength are recognized by all countries in the world.

National Status is Different from the Past

The United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union were the first to recognize China's legitimate status in the international community and its important role in the current world situation. Therefore, from now on, the diplomatic relations between all countries and China must be based on equality. All traces of outdated treaties must be quickly eliminated. All countries in the world have a clear understanding of China's role as the center of culture and democracy in East Asia and the West Pacific region.

All Countries Have a Clear Understanding of China

In Asia, I especially feel that the more the Soviet Union's friendship and assistance to China in its resistance against the war of aggression increases, the more hope there is for the restoration of peace on the Asian continent and in the world. Although China has suffered more than any other country from the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations, I still believe that this instrument of collective planning should be re-established. If China, the Soviet Union, Australia, New Zealand, and India can cooperate wholeheartedly with Western countries, even Japan, when reason and justice are finally restored, should join the cooperation.

### Matsuoka Will Find the Large Number of Pending Issues Between Japan and the Soviet Union Difficult to Handle; It is Rumored That Germany and Italy Failed to Induce Japan to Participate in the War; The Future of Negotiations Between Japan and the Dutch East Indies is Bleak

Chongqing – Regarding the matter of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's talks in Moscow, the Central Daily News commented yesterday that Matsuoka openly stated in Moscow that he would extend his stay in the Soviet Union if necessary, which shows that his negotiations with the Soviet Union are even more important than his visit to Germany. However, there are too many pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, and it is not easy to resolve them all in the current state. Even if Matsuoka reaches an understanding on the general outline, disagreements will inevitably arise when it comes to the details, making it difficult to handle. The Ta Kung Pao advised the Soviet Union not to satisfy Japan's desires, saying that the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan is the predecessor of the anti-communist alliance. The Soviet Union's Far East policy for more than 20 years has been centered on China rather than the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan, so it must not allow Japan to weaken China's resistance. Japan's desires are great but its credibility is small, so the Soviet Union should be careful not to be deceived. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Washington – According to reports received here from Europe, the Axis powers gained very little from Matsuoka's tour of Europe. How Matsuoka fared in Berlin remains a mystery. However, according to reports from Rome, Hitler failed to persuade Japan to participate in the war because Italy has achieved nothing. It is reported that Mussolini suggested to Matsuoka that Japan should fight the United States. However, Matsuoka not only evaded this issue with vague words, but also repeatedly spoke of his friendship with certain British and American figures during his stay in Italy, which greatly saddened Mussolini. Matsuoka also often mentioned "My friend Hull" and "My friend Eden," which was not well received by the Italians. Even in formal meetings, when discussing the responsibility of all civilized countries to abandon war and seek peace, he used a harmonious tone and mentioned British and American figures. The Italian side's anger can be imagined. According to diplomatic sources, the Axis leaders were extremely displeased, so the German authorities actively worked to have the Japanese military force Matsuoka out of the Foreign Ministry, but they were unsuccessful, just like the failure in the southern countries. However, Germany does not seem to be able to use the same methods to deal with Japan as it does with the southern countries, launching attacks to vent its anger. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Tokyo – Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi reviewed the international situation at the prefectural governor's meeting today, saying that the United Kingdom and the United States are now imposing economic pressure on Japan, and the future development is difficult to predict. However, the close relationship between Japan and the Axis powers has been strengthened by the Foreign Minister's visit to Germany and Italy. Ohashi also said that the negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union in Moscow are progressing successfully, and the trade talks will probably be concluded satisfactorily soon. On this matter, the two countries have reached a consensus. Ohashi also criticized the Dutch East Indies delegation in Batavia for making arbitrary and abstract arguments. Ohashi also mentioned that the United States is currently hotly debating whether to use warships to escort ships transporting raw materials to the Allied countries, saying that this issue has aroused serious concern on the Japanese side. Finally, Ohashi strongly condemned the mistreatment of foreigners, saying that all law-abiding foreigners, regardless of their solidarity, will be given full protection. However, foreigners who behave badly must be managed. (Zhongtou News Agency dispatch, 10th)

### Japan Establishes Trading Company to Control Overseas Trade

Tokyo – Japan is now focusing on organizing a trading company to control Japan's trade with various regions in the South Seas, especially Vietnam. It is reported that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the representatives of the Japan Overseas Trade Development Corporation and the Importers and Exporters Association reached a consensus yesterday.

### Ohashi Warns Japanese People to Prepare for a Long War; The United States Has Decided to Provide Assistance to China, Making Relations Between Japan and the United States Difficult to Predict

Tokyo – Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi yesterday made a statement to the heads of various provinces and regions, saying that Japan must prepare to cope with a longer war in China and more strained relations with the United States. He also said that the Chongqing government is making great efforts to repair the Yunnan-Burma Road and is building a railway between Kunming and Lashio to transport military supplies that the United States seems determined to aid with. Therefore, Japan and China may have a longer war. Because the United States is intensifying economic pressure on Japan, it is difficult to predict the future relationship between Japan and these two countries. Ohashi also said that the Tripartite Pact and Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Moscow are unprecedented in the Far East diplomatic record since the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 and 1905. Ohashi believes that Germany can quickly resolve the war in the Balkans and said that Japan's future depends on the Tripartite Pact. He also said that he is very optimistic about the future because: (1) Japan has a strong national structure; (2) Japan has an excellent geographical location; and (3) Japan has the military power to control the Pacific. Ohashi also said that the United States will provide greater assistance to China based on Currie's report. Therefore, Japan must cope with this situation with patience and determination. He also said that he believes that the report made to President Roosevelt by Dr. Currie, who recently visited Chongqing as an economic investigation commissioner, will result in the United States providing more assistance to China.

### Philippine Conference Concludes, Brooke-Popham Returns to Singapore; The Three-Nation Conference is a Prelude to Joint Defense; Important British and Dutch Figures Will Continue to Visit

Manila – Although no official statement has been issued, local newspapers here yesterday published news of the conference between US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre, Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Far East Brooke-Popham, and Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens in a special position, saying that the conference is a sign that joint defense of the Far East has begun to materialize. There is no doubt that the three have exchanged information, and the simultaneous presence of Brooke-Popham and Kleffens here is a welcome coincidence. Sayre met with the British Commander-in-Chief and the Dutch Foreign Minister at his residence for ninety minutes before the meeting ended. Afterwards, when asked whether the topic of the meeting was joint defense of the Far East, Sayre only replied that the talks focused on the "general situation" and that it was natural for him to meet with foreign authorities passing through Manila and talk with them. Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, is currently leading the fleet in routine exercises and therefore did not participate in the talks. Brooke-Popham departed for Singapore this morning, and Kleffens will continue on to Batavia tomorrow. Sayre was on vacation but came here for the talks. Now that the talks are over, he has returned to Baguio for his vacation. At the same time, it is expected that important British and Dutch figures will come here again because Manila is now the most satisfactory stopover for British officials traveling by plane between Hong Kong and Singapore. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Singapore – Admiral Layton, Commander of Singapore, issued a strong statement on the Far East situation today, saying, "If a balloon rises in the Pacific, a powerful naval force will immediately rush to its aid, regardless of whether the United States comes to help."

### Soviet Union Convenes Railway Conference

Moscow – The Soviet People's Commissariat of Railways convened a conference attended by 1,000 key railway figures, with Commissar Kaganovich reporting on the state of Soviet railways in 1940 and new plans for 1941. (TASS dispatch, 10th)

### A Mission from the Dutch East Indies May Come to China, According to Announcements by Military Authorities

Batavia – Lieutenant General Berenschot, Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch East Indies, replied to questions in parliament, saying that the Dutch East Indies will send a military mission to China when it deems it necessary. Berenschot also said that the newly formed parachute regiment has undergone several trials and that the Dutch East Indies war industry has created good mortars and will start mass production as soon as the machines arrive.

### Churchill Reports on the War Situation Amid Cheers in the British House of Commons; Germany Plans to Seek Granaries and Oil Pools; Warns Vichy Not to Assist with Warships

London - British Prime Minister Churchill (see picture) yesterday reported on the progress of the war situation amid cheers in the House of Commons. The main points are as follows: (1) Massawa is now occupied by central forces; (2) German troops entered Salonika on Wednesday morning; (3) British troops in Greece have not yet made contact with enemy forces; (4) Warns Vichy not to send unfinished or damaged warships from French Africa to French territory occupied by the Germans; (5) The only way Britain can support the 1942 war situation without reducing its war efforts is to resume large-scale construction of merchant ships in the United States. In the joint struggle in the coming year, Britain can obtain millions of tons of ships built in the United States (great applause). The United States has now handed over ten of its anti-smuggling patrol ships to Britain for use. Each ship has a displacement of 2,000 tons. These ten ships will be put into service soon; (6) There are various signs that Germany seems to intend to obtain the granaries of Ukraine and the oil pools of the Caucasus.

North African Battle; Indian Soldiers Make a Name

Churchill, when speaking about the war situation in Africa, said, "The loss of Benghazi and the retreat of the British army are in the hands of the enemy. If it were not for this airfield, the British army, in view of the increasingly serious situation in the Balkans, could have refrained from advancing from Tobruk. However, given the defeat of the Italian army, the capture was very easy, so it was considered worthwhile to advance. However, the British army still has other tasks and can only garrison the acquired territory with a small number of soldiers. Before the British army occupied Benghazi, German air force and armored forces had already been transported from Italy and Sicily to Tripoli. Although British submarines and aircraft destroyed many German transport ships, they failed to completely block their passage, causing the Germans to create a strong mechanized force on the African coast. The Germans attacked Benghazi with a larger number of troops than the British initially expected. The British army then retreated to a stronger and easier to defend area. I cannot predict the future trend of the war in Cyrenaica. However, one thing is clear: the British generals' advances and retreats are based solely on military considerations. Now that the Germans are using their armored forces in Cyrenaica, we can know that there will be a major battle. This is not only for the defense of Cyrenaica, but also for the protection of Egypt. Fortunately, the Italian troops in Eritrea, Abyssinia, and British and Italian Somaliland have almost completely collapsed, so a large number of troops and transport vehicles can be transferred to support the British army on the Nile. The occasional setback in the Cyrenaica battlefield has not reduced the war value of the British army's campaign to destroy the Italian Empire in Northeast Africa, nor has it diminished our trust and gratitude to the soldiers. I warned the public half a month ago that they must not harbor extravagant hopes for continuous military victories. In the recent battle of Keren, although the city was captured, the British army still suffered as many as 4,000 casualties. However, the main resistance of the Italian army in Eritrea has now been overcome. The Indian troops have made the most outstanding contributions in the Eritrean region, and every battle has promoted the renowned name of the Indian troops. Asmara has surrendered, and Massawa is now ours. Enemy warships have almost been cleared from the sea, and British transportation is now more convenient. Harar has been captured, and Addis Ababa has also fallen one after another. The army led by Italian Governor Austasio has retreated into the mountains to avoid attacks from Abyssinian patriotic troops. Therefore, the complete annihilation of the Italian army in Abyssinia and the immediate transfer of British troops in Abyssinia can be expected soon."

Greece and Yugoslavia Fight for Freedom

The British Prime Minister, after praising the achievements of the British Navy and Air Force in the Battle of Cape Matapan, said, "Italy's naval power in the Mediterranean has indeed been destroyed. Recalling the dangerous situation in which Britain was in the Middle East after the defeat of the French army, we now see that the situation has changed. The number of Italian prisoners we have captured far exceeds the number of our own soldiers. In addition to the assistance of the Free French and Belgian armies, we have achieved this victory solely with the troops of the British Empire. In the past six months, we have been deeply concerned about Germany's absorption of Hungary, its occupation of Romania, and its occupation of Bulgaria. Germany has continued to amass its armored and mechanized forces and aircraft in these three countries for several months. Now, Greece and Yugoslavia, which have never been willing to participate in the war, now have no choice but to fight to the death for freedom and to protect their motherland. Since last December, the German army's actions of passing through Hungary and Romania and entering Bulgaria have been witnessed by all. Two months ago, the German air force's preparation team, with the tacit consent of King Boris and the joint government, entered Bulgaria in civilian clothes and occupied various airfields in the country. Before Bulgaria's official announcement of joining the Axis, German pilots, soldiers, and political police had already been deployed throughout Bulgaria. When Bulgaria officially announced its accession to the Axis, the German army entered Bulgaria in large numbers. One of its direct destinations was obviously Salonika, which was captured by the German army this morning. We have never regarded the extension of the war to the Balkan Peninsula as our policy or interest. Foreign Secretary Eden and British Chief of Staff General Dill originally intended to visit the southern capital after visiting Athens and Ankara, but were rejected by the government of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia. The main purpose of Eden's visit was to explore ways to establish a united front in the Balkans. Although we are eager to promote such a front to maintain peace in the Balkans, we are determined not to encourage Greece to take any path that is contrary to its wishes in the war against Italy. After all, the assistance we can give to people fighting for freedom is currently limited. We are unwilling to bear the responsibility of urging Greece to clash with another army on its border. However, when Eden first met with the Greek King and the Greek Prime Minister, the Greek Prime Minister automatically declared on behalf of the government that Greece was determined to defend its freedom and territory at any cost and to resist any aggression. Even if Britain, Turkey, or Yugoslavia did not provide assistance, Greece would fight against Italy and Germany to the end on its own. Since Greece had decided to cope with the pressure from Italy and Germany, we naturally agreed with its position, and the troops of the British Empire naturally had to stand on the same front with it. The war is of course dangerous, and this matter is even more dangerous. However, adhering to the motto of safety first is not the way to win. Therefore, we concluded a military alliance with Greece, and the deployment of British troops began from then on."

German Soldiers Unveil Their Masks

The British Prime Minister said of Yugoslavia: "The Paul government of Yugoslavia not only maintained the strictest neutrality but also indulged in a fantasy that some compromise could be reached with Hitler in order to maintain their independence. Here we see the vicious methods used by the Germans once again. German troops in Bulgaria initially increased from dozens of tourists who appreciated the beautiful scenery of the Bulgarian mountains in winter to seven divisions, then twelve divisions, then ten divisions, and finally a total of twenty-five divisions. The unfortunate Yugoslav regent was eventually summoned to Vienna to sign an agreement that would place Yugoslavia, both physically and spiritually, under the complete control of Germany. When the people of Yugoslavia saw this danger, they rose up in revolt, overthrew the government that humiliated the country, and decided to defend their freedom and honor with their lives at the last moment. Hitler, seeing that what was already within his grasp was lost in the end, was understandably furious. At this point, the German troops assembled in Austria set out for northern Yugoslavia, bombing the undefended Yugoslav capital and invading Serbian from the west with armored forces. At the same time, they also unveiled their mask of friendship with Greece, sending another elite force to attack Greece. In the clashes between the two sides, the German army was defeated by the strong Greek army. As for the British army, it has not yet made contact with the enemy."

Britain Must Maintain the Blockade Against Germany

The British Prime Minister, referring to France, said, "The statement issued by General Darlan that France will not take any actions detrimental to the former Allied countries is welcome. We all know that the Vichy government is largely dependent on Hitler. Two million French people are in German hands. Most of France's food has been seized by Germany. The release of prisoners and the distribution of food are exchanged monthly for malicious propaganda or unfriendly behavior against Britain. I would like to state here that we must maintain the blockade against Germany and the right to conduct maritime inspections of contraband. However, we have in fact allowed a large amount of food to be transported into Germany. This is out of our sincere desire to reduce the suffering of the French people. However, if thousands of tons of essential military supplies such as rubber are directly handed over to the German army, then we, even at the risk of naval conflicts with French ships at sea, will have to implement the rights recognized by international law. Under German instruction, Vichy may also take an action, which is to send its warships in African ports that are still under construction or have been damaged to French mainland ports. All the ports of the French mainland are either under German control or can be controlled by Germany at any time. If French warships were to take such action, the balance of naval power would be changed and the interests of Britain and the United States would be harmed. Therefore, I hope that such a situation can be avoided. But if it cannot be avoided, then the resulting consequences will be understood and fairly judged by the French people."

British Air Force Greatly Increased in Strength

Churchill continued to report on the continued progress of the British Air Force's strength compared to Germany, saying, "The British Air Force's strength and bombing power have both greatly increased. The number of air raids we have launched on German ports and cities has increased, and the intensity of British air raids is greater than that suffered by Britain in the night raids. At the same time, our means of defending against German air raids have improved. Our air force now regards moonlit nights as an opportunity to severely damage invading enemy aircraft and to bomb German territory. However, everything depends on the naval battle in the Atlantic. Now the naval battle is intensifying, and British ships and tonnage have been lost heavily. Although the strength of the British shipping industry is extremely great, if this loss continues unabated, it will inevitably hinder our war efforts. Since the beginning of the war, we have lost four million tons of British ships, and the foreign ships or newly built ships flying the British flag that we have obtained are more than three million tons. Therefore, at this time, there has not been a major or significant reduction in the number of our ships sailing at sea. But what will happen if the current rate of loss continues unabated? Where will we find another three or four million tons of ships to make up for this shortfall and enable us to support 1942? We are now building merchant ships at a large scale. However, the only way we can support 1942 without reducing our war efforts is to build merchant ships on a large scale again in the United States, as the United States did in 1918."

Building Merchant Ships to Support the War

"We have now obtained a guarantee that millions of tons of newly built ships in the United States will be available for joint struggle next year. This is the guarantee on which we can rely to support the battle. Without this support, it will not be possible to save the world from harm. I believe that we will definitely be able to cope with the air raids encountered by British ships in the west and northwest. I hope that the people of Southern Ireland will eventually understand that providing our navy and air force with their ports and airfields is not only beneficial to Britain but also beneficial to Southern Ireland. Our navy and air force must eventually go deep into the Atlantic to fight. The failure of German submarines and raiders has proven the effectiveness of convoys. If a large number of weapons and munitions under the US Lend-Lease Act, made with American labor and skills, are sunk to the bottom of the sea and cannot be transported to the front lines that need them so urgently, it would be unthinkable. This would not only be a shame for Britain but also unacceptable to the American people. I can now declare that ten US anti-smuggling patrol ships, each with a displacement of 2,000 tons and equipped with sophisticated weapons, have now been provided to Britain by the US government and will be put into service soon. It is difficult to predict in what aspects Hitler will use his military machine this year. He can attempt an invasion of Britain at any time, but this is not what we fear. In the future, when we have won the naval battle in the Atlantic and ensured the continued supply of supplies from the United States, no matter how far Hitler goes and how many troops he uses, we will eventually be able to control his fate."

### After Occupying Massawa, British Troops Continue to Advance; Tank Vehicles Assisted by the Navy; Defend the Area Around Tobruk Firmly

London - Official sources claim that Addis Ababa is now maintained by the British side, with order in good order. Various ordnance and materials stored by the Italian side have been seized. A large number of captured enemy troops include two battalions of Blackshirts, as well as 60 drivers and more than 1,000 air force ground personnel. At the same time, officials in Cairo announced that the Italian army in Massawa had surrendered and the port had been occupied by the British army. British mobile units are continuing to advance south and southwest along the coastal road from Taesi to Gonda. In Libya, the rearguard of the British army is slowing down the German advance to cover the British main force's impending concentration. Yesterday, they fought fiercely with several superior enemy troops. Also, the German public bulletin said that the German army commanded by General Rommel has occupied Mechili (50 miles southwest of Derna). British colonial minister Moyne claimed in the Upper House yesterday that British tank vehicles and other powerful forces in Libya are now holding strong positions in Tobruk, and that the abandonment of Benghazi was a direct consequence of troops being sent to Greece for reinforcement and armored troops being withdrawn for inspection. Tank vehicles are manufactured in large quantities and must be inspected and refreshed from time to time. The German army advanced 600 miles from Tripoli to Benghazi, and their logistical support in terms of repair, fuel, and drinking water is increasingly difficult, and they lack the assistance of maritime hegemony. British tank vehicles are assisted by maritime hegemony and are defending the area around Tobruk firmly. Moyne also said that the Italian base in the Red Sea has been cleared, and he hopes that President Roosevelt will soon remove the Red Sea from the list of war zones, so that US supplies can be shipped directly through the Red Sea, to avoid transportation through the British axis. (Reuters, 10th)

Cairo - The British Air Force Headquarters in Cairo issued a public bulletin last night, stating that the British Air Force and Free French squadrons in Abyssinia attacked enemy barracks and other military targets in Gondar on Sunday and Monday. Buildings at the Condordia airfield were also hit and caught fire. The South African Air Force attacked and succeeded quite well. Enemy airfields and concentrated enemy forces in the Cyrenaica region were also subjected to continuous attacks. British aircraft returned safely. Massawa Line was occupied by the British Imperial Army and the Free French Army at 2:00 PM on Tuesday. The garrison troops abandoned their stubborn resistance under strong pressure from the British side, raised the white flag and surrendered. British troops in Abyssinia, departing from Aduwa and Adigrat, continued to advance south, mopping up the remnants of the enemy. It is reported that the remnants of the Italian army are concentrated in Taesi, 150 miles northeast of Addis Ababa. (Reuters, 10th)

### Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Send Telegram Expressing Loyalty to the National Government

Chongqing - According to responsible sources here, the Japanese claim that overseas Chinese, who they claim are from the Southeast Asian region, have seceded from the government is completely unfounded. Recently, overseas Chinese from various countries in Southeast Asia held a meeting in Singapore and sent a telegram to Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, expressing their loyalty to the government and supporting the National Government's policy of resisting Japan and building the country. The telegram was sent on March 31, and its original text is as follows: "Overseas Chinese in the Southeast Asian region, including the Philippines, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, and Vietnam, witness that the motherland is currently encountering an unprecedented national crisis and that the day of final victory is approaching. We hereby send a telegram to express our willingness to fully support the National Government, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the policy of resisting Japan and building the country. This firm determination will never be yielded to or changed. We will lead all overseas Chinese to continue this effort." The telegram was signed by the entire General Assembly of the Southeast Asian China War Disaster Relief Fund, and the chairman of the association is Chen Jiageng. This proves Chen's loyalty to the government. (Reuters, 10th)

Anecdotes of the European War (44)

### A Day in the Life of Churchill

When Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, was in opposition, he told the people that if he became the leader of the British Empire's war effort, he would contribute to the country with "blood, tears, toil, and sweat." Now that he is in a position of great responsibility, he is indeed working tirelessly, using all his strength to realize this grand ambition.

At any time, he is always dedicated to the war effort. He shuns other thoughts and concentrates his rich experience, rare talent, and infectious energy on this extremely important goal, dedicating himself to the British Empire.

He now works an average of seventeen hours a day.

He is constantly surrounded by ten secretaries. He meets with the wartime cabinet and other important ministers every day. He maintains the closest contact with the development and strategy of every corner of the empire and every aspect of the empire's military efforts, as if he himself were the Minister of Defense.

Usually, he gets up at seven in the morning and uses his extraordinary energy tirelessly from morning to night until he goes to bed at midnight. Sometimes he does not sleep until three in the morning.

He is very busy every day and cannot spare time for entertainment. He has also reduced his participation in debates in the House of Commons. He is often absent and Minister Attlee answers questions from the members of the House of Commons on his behalf.

Churchill certainly has no time to enjoy family life, but he often tries to steal a moment from his busy schedule to visit his wife and family and take time to have meals with his family.

A person cannot but eat, and the Prime Minister is no exception. However, he uses the time of his meals to meet with many guests he has no time to meet with.

There are really a lot of people who go to see him every day. A secretary will say, "There are really too many people who see him to keep track of." Before lunch, there is a meeting of the wartime cabinet. The entire afternoon is spent with army generals, navy generals, air force generals, etc., coming to see him one after another, sometimes extending until late at night.

Churchill does not have regular exercise. In addition to strolling around the Prime Minister's residence, he only takes untiring tours to inspect the troops, defense areas, and bombed areas. He always wants to see everything with his own eyes before he can feel at ease.

An aide-de-camp said, "He works like a bee. It is his responsibility, and he cannot but do so!"

During the First World War, Churchill served as the First Lord of the Admiralty. When that war began, he was reappointed First Lord of the Admiralty, so he lived in the Admiralty dormitory, which was very close to the Admiralty office. There was a telephone installed by his bed, so he could get news immediately if anything important happened. There is still a telephone by his bed, but its exact location is a secret.

He gets up every day to have a hearty English breakfast, with porridge, fish or kidneys (both of which are not subject to consumption restrictions), toast and jam, coffee, and the like. Then he reads the morning papers, integrating all kinds of telegrams and communications. Although his private secretary makes a selection, he wants to know everything that is evolving, so there is no so-called selection. When he was free, he was always insatiable in his reading, but now he is limited to official reports and newspapers.

He handles a large number of mails with lightning speed. He is worthy of being an organizing expert. He starts reading a large number of newspapers systematically and gives concise and clear instructions to two female secretaries, instructing them to hand over important matters to the relevant personnel for handling. When it comes to matters of great policy, he must personally investigate them thoroughly, understand their essence, and then issue detailed instructions, which his subordinates must follow one by one.

When Churchill was in opposition, he employed no fewer than half a dozen secretaries. No wonder he now needs ten secretaries like President Roosevelt is looking for everywhere. Churchill is usually very easy to get along with, but if you annoy him and he gets angry, he is formidable.

For routine matters, he is usually conservative, but he has a broad vision. If there is anything that hinders direct action, he disregards red tape and takes decisive action in a straightforward manner.

To urge government agencies to avoid the malpractice of slow handling of affairs, he adopted a kind of label, indicating "Handle Today." If anyone does not rush to handle affairs with this urgent order, he will inevitably be severely reprimanded.

He is active at all times, and the two female secretaries can only take turns to wait for his instructions. He often summons them late at night to begin hectic work. He speaks very quickly, eloquently. During the conversation, he often breaks matchsticks into several pieces and throws them on the floor. Sometimes, in order to express himself cautiously, he jumps up from the chair and suddenly jumps back into the chair.

At the table, he always eats as much as possible, and his appetite is extremely large. One of his favorite dishes is very famous, that is, "Old England's roast beef." He also likes to eat thick steaks, but that is not a common occurrence.

When he eats with many people, he often curls up comfortably in the chair, eating and talking. When he is happy, he can monopolize the conversation at the entire table. When he is troubled, he often does not say a word, which greatly surprises his companions or hosts, but when they see his light smile, they forgive him.

He does not often meet with newspaper reporters. Once, when an American visitor met with him, he broke the long-standing practice and talked for thirty minutes. The British reporters stationed in London were greatly sensationalized by this, so he had to break the precedent again and host a dinner for all the reporters. His secretary, like him, is not willing to see guests easily, partly because he respects his wishes and partly because he is afraid of annoying him. Although Churchill has been a newspaper reporter and has written about many people, he does not like people to write about himself.

During this war, he has no recreational hobbies. If he has any, it is only matters related to strategy, which has always been the focus of his life's interests.

In his childhood, he often played with toy soldiers, which showed his extraordinary talent early on. Therefore, his father sent him to the Sandhurst Military Academy, laying the initial foundation for his career as a soldier, a military reporter, a historian, and a politician.

Business News

### Grains, Foreign Rice Orders, Continued Transactions

Foreign Rice: The market immediately and gradually increased,

rising one yuan to several jiao higher than the previous market. Following new transactions in foreign rice the day before yesterday, the market atmosphere was already tending towards stability. However, yesterday the market was closed for two days due to the holiday, and since business would not resume until the 14th, many customers rushed to buy early for actual sales. Merchants and stockpilers alike seized the opportunity to buy, causing the market to become tense. No. 1 Saigon rose to 116 yuan, and other varieties increased across the board. English Flour brand small-grain rice from 132.5 to 133.5 yuan, spot goods 132 yuan, broken rice 105.5 yuan, with transactions exceeding 1,000 tons. Transactions for existing rice involved over 30,000 bags. However, it was confirmed in the afternoon that new transactions continued, and public sentiment and the market began to stabilize. At the close, No. 1 Saigon was priced at 115.5 yuan and 115 yuan, No. 2 Saigon 112 yuan, No. 1 Siam 114 yuan, white small-grain 111 yuan, Zhongguan 110 yuan, Tokyo Top Grade 106 yuan, next grade 101 yuan, broken top grade 91 yuan, ordinary grade 86 yuan, Wuhu top grade 110 yuan, only slightly better than the previous market by a yuan or so. Yesterday’s new transactions included 3,000 tons of Dafu No. 1 Saigon at 133 yuan, and 500 tons from Changcheng at 134 yuan. In addition, Jardine and others are still in negotiations, and transactions are likely.

Foreign rice continues to arrive. The Taikoo Company's new vessel, the "Beihai," arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 19,095 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. Jardine Matheson's "Fusheng" arrived yesterday afternoon, also carrying foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. Accurate figures will be reported later.

Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice varieties remains limited, general customers, due to the increased prices, have weakened their appetite, preventing sellers from raising prices further. The market is showing a flat and sluggish trend. At the Changbang, special Qingjing rice is still priced at 124 yuan, 112 yuan, high grade 120 yuan. Kunshan rice, high grade 117-118 yuan, medium grade 114-115 yuan. Qingjiao rice, thin rice 112 yuan, 110 yuan, special grade 112.5 yuan. Sales of glutinous rice have also slowed down. However, holders of stockpiles are reluctant to sell cheaply, so prices are maintained with difficulty, presenting a stable situation. Recent Hong Kong special grade 110 yuan, 109 yuan, ordinary grade 106-107 yuan, glutinous green beans special grade 101 yuan, 100 yuan, next grade broken 93 yuan.

### Flour Market Fluctuating

Flour: The current foreign flour market initially showed a weak trend, followed by stabilization. The market opened in the morning weaker because foreign rice orders continued to secure vessel space and there were shipments of Can flour en route to Shanghai during the holiday. Golden Dragon brand flour fell back to 28.75 yuan, and Flower Bird Clock Tower brand Australian flour was priced at 29.45 yuan. Subsequently, due to rising rice prices and the three-day spring holiday market closure, actual sales and stockpilers returned to buy in, and Can flour rose again to 28.9 yuan, and Australian flour to 29.6 yuan. It is said that because sentiment is optimistic, Golden Dragon brand flour reached the 29 yuan mark again. The market situation is still fluctuating.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market saw little activity. Arrivals from the interior have been scarce for a long time, and high-grade wheat is priced at 46-47 yuan. It is said that the export department sold several dozen bags, delivered at the company's warehouse in the concession. Japanese factories are still offering 44-45 yuan. Only the market had occasional small purchases. Transactions by Chinese factories have stopped entirely.

### Oil Cakes, Soybean Oil Speculation Rampant

Yesterday, the soybean oil market initially showed a weak trend in the morning as many sought to close out positions to realize profits. However, the majority of bulls firmly held their ground, refusing to sell, exposing the danger of a short squeeze. As a result, most short sellers in the industry, seeing that the overall situation was difficult to reverse, seized the opportunity to cover their positions, causing prices to fluctuate rapidly, resulting in a two- or three-yuan increase for both futures and spot oil. Other varieties saw little rise or fall, with a mediocre underlying trend. Statistics show that 180 barrels of Dalian oil were traded at prices ranging from 153 yuan to 152 yuan, then to 54 yuan; 300 barrels for delivery in April were ordered at prices ranging from 151.75 yuan to 1.5 yuan, then rising to 50.25 yuan; 2,000 barrels for delivery in late April were ordered at prices ranging from 152.5 yuan to 51.75 yuan, then to 55 yuan. Oil from Dayouyu Factory, 100 dan priced at 109 yuan. Peanut oil also showed little movement, with 20 pieces of Jiaozhou oil traded at 120 yuan, and 30 pieces of Yantai oil at 116 yuan. Yesterday, 850 cans of raw oil arrived from Qingdao; today, 1,000 cans of soybean oil will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Finance, Foreign Exchange Quiet, International Situation Bearish, Market Firm with a Tightening Trend

Foreign Exchange: The daily market situation saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. Meetings between British and American officials indicated a quiet state of affairs, with few transactions. However, the market was slightly firmer, mainly due to the bearish international situation, which caused speculators to sell off again. Furthermore, demand from foreign firms was minimal, with both buying and selling telegrams from Hong Kong. Chinese and foreign banks were more inclined to sell. Spot and current-month U.S. exchange rates could be settled at 5.3125 and 34375, respectively. However, at the close, the rate was still 5.3125. Sterling silver was quoted at three-pence two-five, slightly easier than the previous British rate, while the U.S. rate was unchanged. There was no trend for futures. The foreign exchange market will be closed for four days starting today until the 14th for a foreign holiday.

### Gold Market Weak

Swap Premium Unsatisfactory 30 Yuan

The opening of each bar (ten taels) in the early morning was good, with the first quote at 6,540 yuan, three yuan higher than the previous day. Subsequently, Yida Chengyi took the lead in selling, followed by Hengji also selling, and retail investors also came to sell due to the bearish international situation, falling back to 6,505 yuan. However, at this time, Tianyuan covered shorts, and Dafeng Xingyuan followed suit, rising back to 6,522 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange market hardened, and selling pressure resumed, with Xinfeng Yong and other bulls exiting, and Hengji coming back to sell short, and Dafeng reversing from buying to selling, causing the price to fall to 6,500 yuan. After 11:15, sellers decreased, and it was heard that the exchange market had turned flat, and Tianyuan came back to absorb and cover, while Yida Deda also bought. The price rebounded to 6,520 yuan before the close, closing at 6,519 yuan, 18 yuan lower than the previous day. Due to the four-day holiday, swap trading was brought forward by fifteen minutes to 12:45, initially with short sellers quoting a premium of 20 yuan, with only a few transactions. However, the price gradually rose as Tianyuan, Hengji, Lianxing Yi Li and other large short sellers suddenly quoted premiums, reaching 30 yuan. After the opening of swap trading at 1:00, it was announced that short sellers were offering a premium of 25 yuan. Although Xinfeng Yong, Gonghe Yida and other bulls gradually bought in, Dafeng bulls remained on the sidelines, and the overall position on the table still felt like more premium was offered, so the price rose again to 30 yuan. Afterwards, Chi Da Yida bought in, briefly returning to 27 yuan, but ultimately closed at 28 yuan due to Hengji selling short. The opening price for February and May contracts was 6,480 yuan, but due to continued buying interest from retail investors and Chi Da and others buying in, it rose to 6,502 yuan. Afterwards, Hengji sold and increased its short position, and Tong Kang Yong also sold, so the 3:00 close was 6,494 yuan, 25 yuan lower than the noon close for April contracts, and 43 yuan lower than the previous evening's close. Subtracting the 18 yuan premium offered by short sellers in swap trading, it was 15 yuan lower. Hengji sold again off-exchange, with the lowest transaction at 6,485 yuan. Finally, Xinfeng Yong bought in, closing at 6,490 yuan. The difference in the afternoon was 22 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was about 45,000 taels. Sentiment among all parties was weak, and cash transactions were active again. In the morning, Chengji sold 60 taels from Xianghe, and Ziyuan sold 10 taels from Baokang, both at prices 160 yuan higher than the April contract price. Later, Chi Da sold 120 taels, and Mingfeng sold 50 taels, 155 yuan higher. Tianyu sold 50 yuan to Xintianbao, and Chengji 30 taels, 140 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Hengji bought in at 160 yuan higher than the May contract price, with no sellers, more than 30 yuan lower than the previous day. Ornaments were down 10 yuan, at 680 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.

### Securities, Bond Market Slack

Over-the-counter government bonds: Yesterday's market situation saw only half-day trading in the morning due to the four-day holiday from today. The opening sentiment was unusually slack, and transactions were quite scarce. Moreover, with the lottery for type C bonds being held, sellers were more active. Due to the four-day holiday and interest considerations, many parties were unwilling to invest. During this long closure, changes are unpredictable, so activity also came to a standstill. Most players in the market were settling transactions, with Lianyi Renchang Tongkang Yizhong and others buying, and Shengda Xiexing Yuan Hengfu and others selling. As a result, types C and E bonds saw no movement, while the rest were only slightly lower by five fen to one jiao. The total transaction volume was 700,000 yuan. The spring holiday, including the weekend, lasts four days from today, with normal trading resuming on the 15th. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Zhongyi Trust Company were traded at 15.25 yuan per share.

### Yarn and Cotton, Before the Spring Festival, Many Bulls in Cotton Yarn Closed Out Positions

The momentum of the previously rising yarn and cloth market was calmer yesterday. This was because the market will be closed for four days due to the Spring Festival holiday. In order to avoid paying interest on their short positions, and because the factory would charge three yuan per bale for storage from April 15th, many participants closed out their positions to avoid the hassle. As a result, the number of chips on the table loosened, and the market fell from high to low. However, securities firms have covered many of their short positions. However, the situation for miscellaneous yarn brands was not as active as the previous day. Some profits were released, but speculators are generally optimistic. 10-count Double Horse was priced at 1,453 yuan at its highest and 1,431 yuan at its lowest. The market did not see any formal transactions in the afternoon due to the four-day market closure, with a quoted price of 1,443.4 yuan. Today, 384 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning, continuing the enthusiasm of the previous day and continuing to rise, with the opening price at 1,450 yuan, rising slightly to 1,453 yuan. However, as soon as this market opened, only selling was heard in the market, and buyers were scarce, so transactions were few, and the market quickly fell to 1,431 yuan, with most profit-takers closing out their positions. Later, it was heard that foreign exchange was flat and there was no major change in margins, so sentiment turned firm, and the price rose back to 1,438 yuan. As for the situation of miscellaneous yarn brands, it was not encouraging, and there were few buyers, so the market price went down, and many bulls closed out their positions. In addition, the situation in the Balkans took a sharp turn for the worse, with reports that German troops had entered Thessaloniki, which slightly restrained buying. The price fell again to 1,432 yuan, but rebounded to 1,438 yuan at the close. Statistics show that 7,420 bales were traded in half a day. The amount of purchases made by each firm is listed as follows.

### Foreign Cotton Transactions Still Extremely Active

The current cotton situation is somewhat flat and tired. This is because the Balkan War is fierce, German troops occupied Thessaloniki, the overseas cotton market is weak, and the yarn market is somewhat affected. The cotton market, which is interdependent, is also subject to considerable constraints. However, those holding goods are still thinking highly. However, the market was about to close yesterday, and they were afraid that the procedures would not be completed in time, so they all took a wait-and-see attitude, and the manufacturers did not hear about the opening of transactions, and the color was calm. Yesterday, the industry traded 800 pieces with each other, and the price was very large.

In addition, the foreign cotton father's trade in Shanghai Yixing Foreign Company is still in a lively situation, and the buyer continues to replenish. In addition to the factory only purchasing high-grade raw materials, the purchase intention of the industry is stronger, in addition to Indian cotton and Brazilian cotton, there are also a small amount of Argentina and Peruvian flower transactions, and the market situation is quite firm. Recently, the market price of Brazilian cotton per load is about 370 yuan.

### Piece Goods, Factory Quota Exhausted, Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market situation was firm. Because the factory's quota has been exhausted, both the industry and outsiders are very interested in continuing to hoard, and the actual sales demand is still eager. However, due to the closure of the market for business from tomorrow, the transaction was slightly lighter. The selling price of white goods and coarse cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao, and the fine cloth twill was flat in the morning and firm in the afternoon, with a rise of 2.5 jiao. The dyeing cloth was flat. The dyeing factory in Mujie handled more than 200 pieces of fine cloth twill, and the industry traded more than 300 pieces of various cloths. The demand for guest sales in Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs continued to be strong, handling two hundred and several tens of pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, serge and other goods, and the Zhejiang and Fujian gangs handled more than one hundred pieces of coarse and fine cloth and colored cloth, and the northern Yantai gang handled more than one hundred pieces of 16-pound Huadie Shuangxiang and 11-pound San Rabbit and other coarse cloths. Today, there are 580 pieces of fabric in Hong Kong.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Provisional Board of Directors, Candidates for Foreign Directors Have Been Determined, Extra Directors Obtained by Dutch and Swiss Nationals, Chinese Legal Rights and Interests are Eagerly Expected to be Maintained

The full text of the proposal regarding the reorganization of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors was published in yesterday's newspaper. According to a notice issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council, Section 1(A) of the original proposal has been amended as follows: "The directors of the Provisional Board of Directors shall be N.F. Allman, J.D. Carriere, A. Glathe, Yuichi Hagiwara, J.H. Liddell, R.T. McDonnell, R.J. McMullen, G.E. Mitchell, Kazusaku Okamoto, T.S. Powell, Von der Crone, Yasuzo Yajima, together with four Chinese directors.

Sudden Change, Unexpected

According to the published notice, the sudden change in this personnel matter is likely the result of continuous negotiations by the consuls of the three countries. The current Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Keith, was not included in the list of candidates. At the same time, the hope of Portuguese nationals to secure a seat on the Provisional Board of Directors also failed. The neutral countries' directors ended up being one each from Dutch and Swiss nationals. As for who will be the Chinese directors this year, no news has been revealed to date. It is generally expected that there will be major changes, as many of the previous Chinese directors have left Shanghai. However, officials stated yesterday morning that the list of candidates for Chinese directors is often received last, so it cannot be submitted until next week. In fact, this statement is unfounded. The continuation of the five Chinese directors was submitted earliest and filed with the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Chinese side did not agree to this sudden change in quota.

Eagerly Hoping to Maintain the Current Status of Chinese Directors

However, according to sources revealed yesterday, the issue of Chinese directors is under "behind-the-scenes negotiations." The result may be that two of the current Chinese directors still in Shanghai, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, and Guo Shun, will be re-elected, and two others will be selected to join them, making a total of four people. But in fact, since the current Taxpayers' Association has no intention of electing new directors, it will be difficult for the millions of Chinese people in the city to recognize any action to select Chinese directors to fill vacancies by other parties. In addition, among the six members of the Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Committee, Liu Shifang, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guanqun, Jin Tongyin, Zhao Chuanding, and Li Shijie, it is said that only one has left Shanghai, and the rest have remained here. It is widely believed that the matters concerning the Chinese directors and the Chinese Committee will come to light early next week. However, due to the current difficult environment, all sectors are extremely concerned about the position of the Chinese directors and the Chinese Committee, and all are eagerly hoping to maintain the status quo. However, it is difficult to predict how the situation will develop.

A Voice of Justice, Urging Awakening

As events have unfolded to this day, the balance of power in the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors, which the British and Americans have long wished to maintain, has completely collapsed. Of the sixteen seats on the Provisional Board, only six can be controlled by the British and Americans. Although the two seats for Dutch and Swiss directors may tend towards the British and American camp, given the unpredictable current situation in Europe, many "neutral countries" are quite afraid of Hitler's "power" and may change their attitudes overnight. Thus, Japan, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Italy, and the four seats for Chinese directors, totaling ten votes, are the majority on the Board of Directors, undoubtedly enough to overwhelm the six votes of the British and Americans. However, since the vast majority within the concession are Chinese people, the impact of this situation will be most harmful to the Chinese, which is obviously foreseeable. Even the interests of British, American, and other foreigners in Shanghai cannot be guaranteed. The date of the Taxpayers' Meeting is only one week away. Within this week, the Chinese side will continue to use the voice of justice to urge the concession authorities to come to their senses and make amends, it is not too late. If we continue to hesitate and do not change the "appeasement" policy, the sinking of Shanghai will be a disaster for the Chinese, but hardly a fortune for British, American, and other foreigners.

### Public Concession, Epidemic Prevention Campaign

Free Vaccinations Will Be Given from the 15th

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that this year's epidemic prevention campaign is scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month. At that time, residents in the concession can request free vaccinations from the Health Department. There are eleven health sub-offices, including four in the Western District, two in the Central District, four in the Eastern District, and one in the Northern District. For details on the locations and vaccination times of each sub-office, please refer to the notice. Factories wishing to vaccinate their workers can apply in writing to the nearest health sub-office to send mobile vaccination vehicles to the factory for vaccinations, but only if the number of workers is 100 or more. The application period is from the 15th of this month to the 15th of next month.

### Moving Company Automobile Strike, Spread Again Yesterday

The drivers and workers of Taiping, Ningbo, Yong'an, and Shangtian four moving companies went on strike because their wage demands were not met. The strike has lasted five days. The management has not yet responded, which has led to the expansion of the situation. Recently, all the workers of the China Moving Company also joined the strike on the 7th due to the relationship of the alliance contract. It is heard that all the drivers and workers of the Shanghai and Maotai companies also stopped working yesterday. The reasons for the strike are: (1) Driver Cai Fengzhou was arrested by the police for weighing and had his permit revoked for one week. The company deducted his salary during this period. Although Qian Gen, the chief representative of the drivers, negotiated with the management, it was to no avail (according to the precedents, such matters are entirely the responsibility of the company). (2) The management refused to accept the request for increased wages, resulting in this unfortunate event. As for all the drivers and workers of the China Motor Company at 240 Malan Road in the French Concession, they went on strike because their demand for a salary increase was not met. On the day before yesterday, members of the Political Department of the French Concession and the Mechanical Union were sent to mediate the settlement, and everyone was given a living allowance of 20 yuan. Therefore, everyone resumed work yesterday morning.

Business Associates, Appeal to Hong Kong by Telegram

The members of the Commercial Press Society are oppressed by their livelihoods and request a solution. They sent a telegram to General Manager Wang in Hong Kong: "Yun Gong, Greetings, Prices in Shanghai have risen dramatically, rice is 130 yuan, coal balls 17 yuan, members are unable to make ends meet, in distress, please find a solution, universally increase according to the price index up and down, seek once and for all, reply quickly, Shanghai Mutual Aid Society."

### Japanese Man Oimura and His Chinese Friend Shot Dead, Another Japanese Man Also Shot and Seriously Injured, Rue Wagner Was Tense Last Night

At 8:20 last night, a shooting occurred in front of the Guohua Bank at the intersection of Rue Wagner and Avenue Pichon in the French Concession. The victims were two Japanese men and one Chinese man. Two of the victims were fatally wounded, and the situation was tense. Details are as follows:

Dining at a Restaurant, Leaving Together

Last night, a Japanese man named (a writer) accompanied by his Chinese friend Xu Furong and another unnamed Japanese friend dined at the Fuchunlou Yangzhou restaurant at 25-27 Rue Wagner in the French Concession. They finished at 8:20 and the two Japanese men and the Chinese man walked out of the Fuchunlou restaurant, chatting side by side, and walked east on Rue Wagner.

Following and Shooting, Two Men Killed

When they passed the front of the Guohua Bank at the intersection of Rue Wagner and Avenue Pichon, three or four men suddenly followed behind and shot six or seven times at the backs of the two Japanese men and the Chinese man. The Japanese man Oimura and the Chinese man Xu Furong were caught off guard and hit in vital organs. They both fell into a pool of blood and died instantly. Another Japanese man was also seriously injured and fell to the ground, moaning. The shooters fled into the darkness when they saw that their goal had been achieved.

Injured Japanese Man, Sent to Hospital for Treatment

Upon hearing the alarm, the police sent a large number of detectives to the scene to investigate. Later, the bodies of the Japanese man Oimura and the Chinese man Xu Furong were taken to the morgue on Rue Lartigue for examination. The other injured Japanese man was sent to the hospital for treatment. A thorough search was conducted at the scene, but nothing was found. The police are still investigating the cause of the shooting.

Bystander Shot, Injured in the Back

At that time, a passerby, Xin Dinglong, 29 years old, from Ningbo, a coppersmith, was hit in the back by a stray bullet and was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. However, according to another source, Xu Furong was shot in the abdomen and sent to Guangci Hospital, where he died from his injuries at 10 p.m.

### Sanctions on Coal Prices Will Take Decisive Measures

According to sources, the authorities believe that the soaring coal prices are purely the result of manipulation and monopoly of bulk coal by those who seek private gain. The increase in costs and the lack of supply are just excuses. They have been given close attention and a firm decision has been made to take decisive measures and impose severe sanctions, so the public can wait and see. It is also learned that some speculators are taking advantage of the fire and refusing to supply the market with all their warehouse receipts, and selling them back and forth to extract illegal extra profits, so that the price of smoke and white coal is getting higher and higher, and the general public is seriously threatened. However, the Coal Industry Association, as the highest coal industry group, has remained silent at this time when coal prices are soaring day and night, which is very regrettable. The rice market was closed for two days from today for the Tomb-Sweeping Festival due to the notice from the market management committee, and sales will resume from next week. Each rice store added more spot goods to the market, but most large households hoarded goods, resulting in foreign rice rising by two yuan per load compared to the previous market, which is not justified. The total transaction volume in the city increased sharply to about 20,000 bags yesterday.

### Hongkou Japanese Special Service Department Suddenly Attacked Last Night: Over Twenty Chinese Youths Armed and Rushed In, Both Sides Exchanged Fire and Fought for a Long Time

At around 6:45 PM on the afternoon of the [date missing] at the Japanese Army Special Service Department on Dixwell Road, Hongkou, over twenty Chinese youths, armed, suddenly rushed in. The Japanese Special Service Department noticed and immediately went out to resist. Both sides opened fire, the sounds of gunfire and fighting were as dense as a string of pearls. They fought for quite a long time. The Chinese youths, having run out of bullets, then retreated in different directions. It is said that four men were captured by the Japanese. Afterwards, the Japanese sent out a large number of soldiers to search the area near the scene of the incident and cut off traffic, but to no avail. It was impossible to investigate at the time whether there were any casualties on either side during the fight. It is reported that when the shooting started, neighboring shops and residents were extremely frightened and closed their doors, not daring to go out. The situation was very tense.

Shooting of Japanese Soldiers: Over a Hundred People Arrested

According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," after two sergeants, Yoshida and Kojima, of the Japanese Military Police in Yangshupu, were assassinated and killed at the intersection of Dalian Road yesterday morning (the 9th), the Japanese Marines immediately conducted a large-scale search at the scene of the incident. One hundred and fifty Chinese people were detained, including four who were believed to be related to the murder case. Yesterday afternoon and evening, the Japanese military took strict measures throughout the Yangshupu area, prohibiting residents from traveling on the streets. Normalcy only returned today. The arrested individuals are still being detained. Japanese officials have refused to disclose details regarding the detention of these individuals. One account states that the Japanese side is still continuing its investigation.

### Today is Tomb Sweeping Day

Shanghai's Banking and Money Exchange Associations' member firms will, in accordance with association regulations, take a four-day Tomb Sweeping holiday from today until the 14th. Business will resume on April 15th (Tuesday). All bill collections and settlements during the holiday period will be handled on the day of resumption. As for the foreign exchange, cash, securities, cotton yarn, and other markets, all will be closed for four days starting today. However, the bean, rice, and grain markets will be closed for three days and will resume business on April 14th. The unofficial cash and bond markets had already completed delivery and hedging transactions this afternoon. Foreign banks and various institutions are also closed for four days today for Easter Sunday.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Train Hits Mine and Explodes

According to Pingming News Agency, at around 8:30 AM the day before yesterday (the 9th), a Shanghai-Hangzhou train hit a landmine planted by Chinese troops between Xiashi and Xieqiao, causing the train to be destroyed and the tracks damaged. The driver and fireman were both injured and killed. Shanghai-Hangzhou rail traffic was disrupted for half a day, and direct train service has not yet been restored as of yesterday.

### No New Developments in the Ai Kao Arrest Case

Special Police Officers Indignant, But Still Serving Loyally

According to the "China Mail," French businessman Ai Kao, the leader of the Free French movement in Shanghai, has been detained on the French gunboat "Garna" for the fifth day as of yesterday (the 9th), with no new developments. The date of the trial has not yet been decided. Regarding rumors yesterday that Ai Kao might soon be tried on the "Garna," it has been learned that there is currently no question of a trial, as the case is still under investigation.

A trial cannot be held until the investigation is complete. Sources claim that if the French authorities do not find concrete evidence during the investigation, they may release Ai Kao, but this has not been confirmed as the authorities are remaining silent on the matter. Ai Kao's lawyer, Mr. Prime, met with his client in private on Tuesday afternoon and will visit him again today (the 10th). It is reported that Ai Kao's arrest has not only angered supporters of the Free French movement, but has also shocked other French expatriates in Shanghai.

Perhaps the most indignant are the special police of the French Concession Police Department. This team, composed of people of various nationalities, held a monthly meeting on Monday night and resolved that, despite their indignation at Ai Kao's arrest, they would still be ready to be mobilized in an emergency.

### Yu Qiaqing Flies from Hong Kong to Chongqing

Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, after leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong, immediately flew from Hong Kong to Chongqing. Mr. Yu originally intended to enter Kunming via Rangoon and then transfer to Chongqing, but due to time constraints, he decided to fly to Chongqing first, and then visit Guiyang, Guilin, Kunming, and other places for on-site inspections, before traveling to Rangoon via the Yunnan-Burma Road.

### Passengers Traveling to Hong Kong Must Have Cholera Vaccination Certificates

Passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong and other places are required to have a doctor's certificate. This certificate must be issued by official organizations such as the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement Health Department, the Shanghai French Concession Public Works Bureau Health Department, and the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Department, and must have a photo of the passenger attached in order to be valid. It has been learned that in the past, when the weather was cold, passengers could board after obtaining a doctor's certificate for vaccination. Now that it is late spring and early summer, major steamship companies in various ports have recently stipulated that passengers must not only have a prescribed smallpox vaccination certificate, but also undergo cholera vaccination before they can purchase tickets and travel. The validity period of the smallpox and cholera vaccination certificates is also specified. Smallpox vaccination must be done fourteen days before departure and is valid for three years. Cholera vaccination must be done six days before departure and is valid for six months in order to be valid.

### Aurora Photographic Society Public Health Photo Exhibition

### Proposal to Sell the American Club Rejected: American Expatriates Held a Vote Yesterday; More Opposed the Sale than Supported It

The American Association of this port convened a meeting of all its members yesterday afternoon to make a final decision on the sale of the American Club at 209 Fuzhou Road. At that time, those who favored the sale and those who opposed the sale expressed their opinions. Among them, the opposition to the sale by Mr. Aleman, the American Director of the Municipal Council, was the most intense, and he stated the reasons why the clubhouse should not be sold in an eloquent manner. Finally, a vote was held. As a result, more people opposed the sale than supported it, by a ratio of three to one. Thus, the motion to sell was rejected.

Suggestion to Donate Funds to Recover Bonds

Mr. Corner, a member of the American Association, has proposed a suggestion to recover the club's bonds in order to increase income, seconded by Mr. Nohhan. The suggestion argues that each member should donate 200 yuan annually, paid quarterly, to a trust fund to be used to buy back the club's bonds on the open market or from individuals. If this method is implemented, 125,000 yuan in bonds can be recovered by the end of the first year, reducing the interest on the bonds by 5,000 yuan, which can be attributed to the 1941 fiscal year's income.

The Club Should be Worth US$200,000

According to the opinion of Mr. Noh, the seconder, the club could be sold for 2.5 million yuan, which would not be a harmonious outcome for the club in the end. The clubhouse is a valuable property, usually worth at least US$200,000. Demand for office space in the central district is strong, so if the clubhouse is sold in a few years, the price may be much higher than it is now.

### Shell Explodes on Zhongshan Road

At about 10:30 AM yesterday morning, a huge explosion occurred in this city. The sound was so loud that it could be heard even in the French Concession. Afterwards, it was learned that the loud noise was the sound of a shell exploding on the bank of the No. 4 Bridge on Zhongshan Road in the west of Shanghai. It turned out that three farmers and a child were digging soil on a wasteland across from the Zhongda Manufacturing Factory when they dug out a large shell buried in the mud, which had been left behind when the Chinese army retreated westward. The shell was pointed at both ends and one and a half feet long. The farmers and the child did not know what it was, so they carried it to a nearby grave. The four of them, young and old, then hammered it violently. Unexpectedly, the shell exploded immediately, with a deafening roar. The four of them were caught in the blast, and were blown into several pieces, with blood and flesh flying everywhere. Limbs were broken and heads severed. All were killed in the explosion. Afterwards, a tattered "Citizen's Certificate" was found next to the corpses, with the words "Song Jiang, eighteen years old, from Jiangbei."

### Ninghai and Fenghua Bombed

Three Japanese aircraft flew over Ninghai County at 8:26 AM on [date missing], circling over the county seat and dropping several bombs inside and outside the city. One bomb landed in Caijia Lane within the territory, destroying more than 20 houses, killing one person, and injuring four. Six bombs landed on the Maxi Yang Bridge outside the North Gate, killing and injuring one person each. At 9:17 AM, the same group of Japanese aircraft continued into Song'ao, Fenghua, dropping two bombs at Wu Jiabu in Song'ao, destroying one house and killing one person. Another bomb landed at Xia Gaomen, but did not explode. The group of Japanese aircraft then headed north via Xikou and Chuanshan.

### French Concession Strictly Bans Flower Gambling

Recently, the scourge of flower gambling has spread to various districts, directly and indirectly damaging people's livelihoods. In order to strictly ban flower gambling, the French Concession has decided to severely punish flower gambling offenders. In the future, anyone who opens a flower gambling parlor will be sentenced to imprisonment at the very least, and no fines will be allowed in lieu of imprisonment. Hopefully, the flower gambling trend in the French Concession can be curbed somewhat.

### Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition in the French Concession

The Shanghai Calligraphy Academy is an organization of famous calligraphers and painters in Shanghai. In view of the rarity of calligraphy and painting exhibitions in the French Concession, they have specifically opened a studio at No. 334, 3rd floor, Huili Qiu Chang, Yierbei Road, as a long-term exhibition, collecting masterpieces of calligraphy and painting from ancient and modern artists, and making them available to fellow enthusiasts. It is reported that since the opening, the number of appreciators has been continuous. The academy also rents out its premises for personal exhibitions. Please visit the academy for details.

### Sacred Midwifery Knowledge: A Cruel Story Arising from Difficult Labor

— Wei

I recently saw in the newspaper: "Mrs. Chen, the wife of the school principal, gave birth in an air raid shelter during an air raid last year. There was no way to invite an obstetrician, and none of the women in the shelter had any midwifery knowledge. Therefore, Principal Chen took on the task of delivering the baby himself, which was widely praised." This incident points out the necessity for every woman to have basic midwifery knowledge, and makes it imperative that every woman have scientific midwifery knowledge. The Ministry of Education's revised standards for girls' home economics courses now include items such as prenatal health, postpartum health, and infant care, which may be the prelude to cultivating midwifery knowledge in every woman.

Below are some unsystematic conversations I recently heard about midwifery, so I will describe them unsystematically, or perhaps it can be said that it is an aid to promoting women's midwifery.

Miss [Name] is already a skilled midwife. After graduating from midwifery school, thanks to nearly ten years of delivery experience, she has considerable confidence in handling any difficult deliveries. She has worked as a midwife in hospitals in Hangzhou and Shanghai, and has also established her own clinic. Now she is working as a midwife physician in a large-scale, well-equipped private hospital in this port. She often resents her bad luck and envies some of her classmates whose knowledge is not as good as hers, but who are already successfully running their own obstetrics businesses.

Her gentle, quiet, and taciturn personality prevents her from realizing her ambitions. A woman is most easily swallowed up by an evil society. Fortunately, she grew up in a poor family. She has the virtues of hard work and perseverance, and a spirit of hard work. She did not receive a good education in her youth, but her spirit of diligent self-study overcame her lack of schooling. Later, she passed the entrance exam to a women's midwifery school. She gained a wealth of knowledge in obstetrics, coupled with her many years of midwifery experience and her steady and agile techniques, she is an excellent midwife physician. Her age is perfectly suited for her current job. I think the goddess of fortune will surely bestow her favors on a promising woman.

The midwifery doctors in the hospital are required to stick to their posts day and night. Their duties include both internal and external tasks. Internal tasks are working in the hospital, and external tasks are going to the homes of pregnant women to deliver babies. External tasks are rotated by all the midwives. When it is your turn for external tasks, it often comes suddenly. A phone call urging you to deliver a baby must immediately wake you from your sleep and drive you to the pregnant woman's home to deliver the baby. No matter how bad the weather is, whether it is windy, rainy, or snowy, you cannot relax even slightly. Some people always think that the chief physician has superior techniques and rich experience, and like to pay higher fees to specifically request the chief to deliver the baby.

Ordinary, normal deliveries are actually the easiest thing, and there is absolutely no unexpected danger. Anyone with a little experience can do it happily. But the most important thing to pay attention to is: one is that the wrist must be agile to avoid pain for the pregnant woman; the other is to maintain cleanliness. Regardless of whether it is a baby or a pregnant woman, in the event of difficult labor, you must not panic, and use both hard and soft tactics, as the saying goes, "be bold and careful." Because at this time, the lives of the pregnant woman and the fetus are in the hands of the midwife. Those with rich experience can calmly solve this difficulty without incident. If you are flustered and clumsy, both lives can be lost innocently. So the responsibility of a midwife is very great. In normal deliveries, try to reduce the pain of the pregnant woman, and in difficult deliveries, try to maintain safety. Often, some obstetricians who think they are superior, regardless of the pain of the pregnant woman, use cruel methods, whether it is a normal or difficult delivery, using scissors to cut the pregnant woman's perineum to make it easier for the fetus to be delivered, so that they can save effort. This is still understandable in difficult deliveries, but is it not too cruel to use this kind of method even in normal deliveries? The responsibility and morality of midwifery should absolutely not be ignored. (To be continued)

### Founding of the All-America China Relief Association: Raising Five Million Yuan; Established by Merging Seven Organizations; Relief to China Will Become More Active Thereafter

Colonel Ross F. [Name], President of the American Medical Bureau for Aid to China, has always advocated that China relief organizations should concentrate their efforts in order to achieve the greatest effectiveness in aiding China. This view can be seen in Ross's Double Tenth Day speech last year, in which he appealed to overseas Chinese organizations to unite as one. Last year, Ross contacted those who were enthusiastic about helping China and worked hard to establish an "All-America China Relief Federation" by uniting seven China relief organizations in the United States. The association has now been established and has begun operations in New York. In the future, China relief matters will definitely be able to move forward.

Large Scale and Sound Organization

The All-America China Relief Federation is large in scale and well organized. A Chinese Committee and a Medical Aid Association [exist?]. Zheng Jia [Name], Minister of Propaganda, was hired as the Secretary-General of the Committee and is currently working on it. The affairs of the Medical Aid for China's Propaganda Department are being temporarily handled by San Jun [Name], the Chinese Secretary of the Association.

Fundraising Campaign Starts This Month

The office term of the All-America China Relief Federation is determined entirely by the needs of the fundraising plan. Currently, the association hopes to raise a large donation of five million yuan, which is scheduled to be completed from April 1 to the end of July this year. Therefore, the association's activities are also tentatively scheduled to end at the end of July. During this period, all activities of the American Medical Bureau for Aid to China will continue in addition to assisting the Federation, and will not be interrupted. In other words, on the united front, the Medical Bureau for Aid to China is a member of the Federation. Separately, it is still an independent organization. Therefore, those who wish to donate to the Medical Bureau for Aid to China can continue to send their donations directly to the following address: American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, 57 William Street, New York, N.Y., U.S.A.

### Boiler Explosion at "Huazhong Water and Electricity Company"

At about 11:00 AM yesterday morning, the steam boiler in the boiler room of the "Huazhong Water and Electricity Company" at Henghong Bridge on North Sichuan Road, Zhabei, suddenly exploded due to excessive heat. With a loud noise, iron fragments shot out in all directions. Several workers next to the boiler were unable to escape and were injured in the explosion. After inspection, it was found that seven workers were injured. The "Company" summoned a car to send Ma Xiangsheng, Gu Xiaodi, Chen Sihai, Wei Lanfen, Wu Jinrong, and five others (all seriously injured) to Fumin Hospital, and then transferred them to the Bazilu Sanatorium for treatment. It is reported that their lives are in extreme danger. The other two workers, Lu Hongsheng (37 years old) and Zhou Jintao (23 years old), were sent by car to Renji Hospital for medical treatment.

### Boy Hit by Car

At 7:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Hu Xuexin, an eleven-year-old boy living at No. 31, Shanghai New Village, Xiafei Road, was walking with his mother at the intersection of Foch Road and Saposai Road when he was suddenly hit by a private car No. 18476. His right lower leg bone was crushed and he was severely injured. He was summoned by the police and taken to the hospital for treatment.

### Landlords in Lianzhu Lane Continue to Oppress Residents After Increasing Rents: Using Demolition of Houses to Treat a Small Number of Tenants: All Residents of the Lane Seek Just Self-Defense

The residents of Lianzhu Lane on Avenue Edward VII are mostly people in the industrial and commercial fields. Most have been renting for two or thirty years. The property has changed hands repeatedly, and incidents such as rent increases have occurred more than once. Both parties have resolved them harmoniously, and there has never been any act of oppression against tenants. Since June last year, when the property was bought by Hengtai Company, a Chaozhou tycoon named Chen, and then managed by the McTavish & Co.,

The tenants were notified that the rent would be increased by 10% from September, including water costs. The tenants were terrified because the previous landlord had only recently increased the rent, and now there was another increase. They repeatedly pleaded with the rental office and the landlord in various ways, willing to increase the rent by 15%. McTavish & Co. then agreed to reduce it to 21%. The tenants knew that the struggle was futile and had to endure it. Unexpectedly, McTavish & Co. broke its word for some reason and did not come to collect the rent. Seeing the landlord's changing attitude, the tenants knew that he was

planning something

On the one hand, they automatically deposited the monthly rent in the court, and on the other hand, they sent representatives to negotiate with him, determined not to cause trouble, so they retreated step by step. They had already agreed to increase the rent to 25% for the houses in the lane and 30% for the shops, which was equal to the landlord's original agreement. They only asked that the rent not be increased again within two years. The landlord also agreed on the surface, but deliberately raised objections, saying that the subsequent increase in water costs would have to be borne by each household, and that he would not be responsible for the repair of the houses.

Deliberately delayed

In secret, he made arrangements step by step, first notifying the water company to cut off the water. Fortunately, the company understood the overall situation and said that the owner could not use cutting off the water as a tool to increase the rent, and came forward to dissuade him. Seeing that his plan was not successful, the landlord intensified his efforts and threatened the tenants with the sale of the property. He also mobilized a certain foreign company to come forward, claiming to have bought the buildings on the entire lane.

Applying horizontal pressure

Therefore, tenants of No. 9, No. 11, and No. 13 were solely notified to move out on April 16, as an attempt to break through one by one. Seeing the landlord's increasingly cruel and fierce methods, the tenants, in order to ensure their safety of residence, had no choice but to unite to defend themselves. In addition to entrusting two major lawyers, Shi Lin and Ling Changyan, to issue a statement in the newspaper and come forward to negotiate, they also reported to the relevant authorities, requesting protection, in order to avoid setting a bad precedent for millions of residents in the city, and to ensure the safety of thousands of residents in Lianzhu Lane.

### Unsuccessful Kidnapping of Bei Runsheng, Followed by a Threatening Letter: Imposters Extorting Funds, Claiming to Provide Relief. Perpetrator Arrested at Bei's Residence During Negotiation

The Jing'an Temple Police had previously thwarted the attempted kidnapping of the wealthy dye merchant Bei Runsheng by Zhou Jinwen and others, the abductors of Bei Yikun and his son. They were escorted to the Special Court No. 1 for interrogation and detention. On the afternoon of the 7th of this month, another threatening and extortionate letter from the criminal gang arrived at Bei Runsheng's residence at 170 Nanyang Road. The letter was signed by "All Comrades of the Three People's Loving Society." The content stated that the group was dedicated to upholding the Three Principles of the People, embracing patriotism and love for the people. Due to

Financial Difficulties

they earnestly requested assistance from renowned figures in Shanghai, as Chu Hsia-Ching, Huang Jinrong, Xie Baosheng, Fan Hengde, and Chen Chuxiang had all previously provided support. Now, the group intended to work in Leping, Jiangxi, but lacked travel funds. They had long admired Mr. Bei's generosity and willingness to help those in need and rescue those in distress, so they specifically requested his strong support. Furthermore, due to the large number of members in the group, it would be inconvenient to visit the residence in large numbers, so they decided to send Zhang Arong, a comrade from the group's miscellaneous affairs department, alone to negotiate between 2 PM and 4 PM on April 8th.

On the 8th, Zhang Arong, a native of Ningbo, indeed arrived at the Bei residence to negotiate. The doorman informed him that the master of the house was out and asked him to return the next day. Zhang waited until 6 PM before leaving in disappointment. Mr. Bei then sent a letter to the Jing'an Temple Police, and Detective Wu DeKui was dispatched to secretly wait nearby the day before. Zhang indeed returned and was arrested by the detective and taken to the police station. It was discovered that Zhang had a long history of theft, with more than seventeen cases on record.

Ordered to be Detained

He was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Court No. 1 yesterday morning. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, filed charges of attempted fraud, stating that the defendant had written similar letters to various locations to swindle money and had committed many crimes. He requested a postponement of the hearing. The defendant Zhang Arong admitted to writing the letter. Judge Pei ordered Zhang to be detained and scheduled the next hearing for the 17th.

### Current Status of the National Beiping Academy in Kunming: Many Inventions from Various Research Institutes

(Kunming Correspondent) The National Beiping Academy is a domestic academic research institution that emphasizes both theoretical and practical aspects. Its mission is to conduct scientific research and promote academic progress. Since its establishment, it has been operating for eleven years. In the past three or four years, due to the impact of the war, various institutes have been relocated to Yunnan, and books and equipment have also been transported there. Among them, the Meteorological Observatory, the Museum, and the Geological Research Institute have been temporarily suspended due to financial constraints. Although the scope of the remaining departments has been reduced, they still maintain their main work and pay special attention to applied research, such as applied optics, applied chemistry, and research on Chinese medicine. At the same time, they pay attention to local surveys and research with academic value or economic value. The working conditions of each institute over the past year are briefly recorded below:

(1) The current work of the Physics Research Institute is concentrated on applied optics and geophysics. In applied optics, in addition to design, it is also engaged in the manufacture of pentagonal rangefinders, periscopes, and scissor-type mirrors. Geophysical work is currently focused on the exploration of metallic mineral resources and is cooperating with the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to decide to compile and print a special publication on geophysics to publish relevant papers.

(2) The Radium Research Institute is cooperating with Sino-French University. In addition to pure radium research, it also focuses on the research of the structure and properties of alloys using X-rays. In the optical section, in terms of pure academic theory, it focuses on the research of various molecules and atomic spectra. In terms of application, it focuses on creating various new optical glasses.

(3) The Chemical Research Institute focuses on applied chemistry. There are a total of five achievements in the past year. 1. Dyes extracted from domestic plants are used to dye wool and cloth into a grass-yellow color, which is extremely wash-resistant and sun-resistant. 2. Re-refining of waste "machine lubricating oil" and refining vegetable oil for diesel engines. 3. Refining Yunnan-produced yellow sugar. 4. Extraction and bleaching of casein from soy milk. 5. Trial production of gasoline substitutes using syrup.

(4) The Pharmaceutical Research Institute is cooperating with Sino-French University to continue its past work of extracting effective substances from Chinese medicines, studying their blood and utilizing them. The work scope is divided into three departments: chemical research, pharmacology, and manufacturing. The products manufactured over the years, such as ephedrine, hemostatin, chaulmoogra oil lotion, and vitamin B, are all ordinary medicines that are made into pure chemicals and are very popular with the medical community.

(5) The Physiological Animal Research Institute combined the Physiological and Animal Research Institutes this year to form the Physiological Animal Research Institute, which is divided into the Physiological Group and the Animal Group. The Physiological Group focuses on investigating the value of food and its nutrition in various southwestern provinces, investigating the products of medicinal materials in Yunnan Province, and studying their physiological effects, as well as studying the metabolism of the people of Yunnan Province. The Animal Group focuses on investigating the aquatic products of Dianchi Lake and Erhai Lake and continues to work with the "Yunnan Aquatic Products Experiment Institute" jointly formed with the Yunnan Provincial Construction Department.

(6) The Botany Research Institute originally focused on classification research and the investigation of plants in northern and northwestern China. In recent years, it has paid special attention to agriculture and forestry, such as the distribution area of forests, the types of crops and their diseases, and the production of medicinal plant species. The institute and the National Northwest Agricultural College jointly formed the Northwest China Plant Survey Institute, which was originally scheduled for four years. Now it has expired with great results and has been extended for another year. In addition, it is cooperating with the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the National Xikang Institute of Technology to investigate the plants belonging to Ning in Xikang Province and will begin soon.

(7) In addition to sorting out the data excavated from Doujitai in Baoji County, Shaanxi, and preparing to publish its results, the Institute of Historical Studies has been engaged in the collection and research of historical materials of ethnic groups on the border of Yunnan in recent years. In April of last year, the institute and the National Beiping Library established temporary cooperation measures to use the southwestern literature collected by the library to facilitate research.

Academic Lectures

### How to Study Chinese (1)

— Xue Wujing

...Twenty Years of Effort, Could It Turn into Smoke?...

...Casting a Brick to Attract Jade, An Old Horse Trying Its Best...

I. Introduction

I am a teacher, a teacher who has taught Chinese for twenty years. Throughout my career in various schools, I have taught no fewer than three thousand students. Although I am half a century old, I have not achieved much. However, "a wise man may have a thousand plans but will inevitably make a mistake; a fool may have a thousand plans but will inevitably gain something." If I mislead students, I should go to the Avici hell. Since I started studying, I have written a long article in Jiangsu Education about my experiences in learning Chinese over the past twenty years, so I won't mention it. In the past twenty years, in my teaching career, I have seen many good students and taught many talented women. I am always cautious and never complacent, trying my best to arouse their interest and promote their progress. Seeing the garden full of peach and plum trees, from seed to sprout, to blossom and bear fruit, as Mencius said, "One of the greatest joys is to obtain the best talents in the world and educate them." This is truly a great joy in life. Therefore, before I start writing about how to study Chinese, I will start by writing sixteen big characters: know me or blame me, for good or for bad. I can only ask the readers to forgive and correct me.

II. Definition

Let's stop the small talk and get down to business. What I want to explain now is the definition of Chinese.

(1) Chinese is not Sinology. "Sinology refers to the crystallized thoughts of the Chinese nation expressed in writing, using reasonable, organized, and systematic methods to record their birth and death, analyze their nature, list their forms of expression, and investigate their causal relationships" (see Ma Ying's Introduction to Sinology). Its scope includes philosophy, history, literature, and philology, which are the facts of specialized scholars. How can someone who is simply learning Chinese dare to inquire about it?

(2) Chinese is not literature. Literature has two meanings: (a) "Writing on bamboo and silk with words is called literature, and its method is called literary studies" (see Taiyan's Literary Theory). Its scope includes sentences that form sentences and those that do not form sentences, and those that form sentences are divided into those with rhyme and those without rhyme. (b) "Things come from contemplation, and meaning belongs to the vastness...It is called Wen Xuan" (see Prince Zhaoming's Preface to Wen Xuan). Its scope only refers to poetry and beautiful prose. The former is too broad, and the latter is too narrow. How can someone who studies Chinese dare to step into its boundaries?

In addition to the above two points, there are even those who regard philosophy, history, social issues, etc., as Chinese. That is truly vast and limitless, like flowing clouds, and everything is Chinese. Wouldn't it make people shrink back? I think the definition of Chinese is simply—

Using the language of our country to write about the reflections of human life, with correct thoughts, harmonious rhythm, and correct grammar, that everyone can appreciate or publish, that is called Chinese.

III. Efficacy

Humans are animals with emotions and reason. Only with Qu Yuan's passion for loyalty to the emperor and love for the country could he create "Li Sao." Only with Lao Tzu's profound and simple understanding could he create the "Tao Te Ching." Other examples include Marseillaise's revolutionary song and Rousseau's "On the Social Contract." Aren't they all burning with passion, flowing out of their hearts to speak for humanity, to seek resistance for the common people, and to promote civilization for the world? All good words, great thoughts, and moving articles are records of human life, that is, the efficacy expressed in words. How can those pedantic people who "use literature to carry the Tao" dream of even one ten-thousandth of it?

Spring is originally "when epidemics are rampant, so 2,300 people died in the two concessions in a week. Indeed, it is 'worthy of attention'!"

It may be said, "Life is a hundred years, and death is inevitable." The death of two or three thousand people is not worth writing about in detail. But after all, there are still people who are dying, wanting to die, or in a state between life and death. In addition, the "epidemic" will speed up their death!

An investigation shows that those who die from the "epidemic" are definitely "skin and bones," which is very "logical." If clothing is not warm enough and food is not enough to eat, then naturally, there is no need to talk about health and hygiene.

Therefore, the most important thing is: not in "health preservation"; second, not in "attention"; third, not in "waving flags and shouting, drumming and cheering." But in how to completely eliminate the "epidemic"!

Knowing what it is, and even more knowing why it is, but not being able to stop the spread of "epidemic," what is the way?

### Morning Tears

— Zuo Hui

Nine o'clock is the time to buy groceries. The hostess is calling, "Aunt Yang!"

There was no reply, not because Aunt Yang didn't hear it, but because a feeling of desolation from her heart wrapped around Aunt Yang's feet and sealed Aunt Yang's mouth.

"Aunt Yang!" the hostess's tone became heavier.

"Coming." Raising the corner of her clothes, after wiping away two drops of tears, Aunt Yang went into the madam's room. The madam gave her six yuan, because there might be guests coming today, so the grocery money was twice as much as usual.

Turning around into the kitchen, taking a basket, dragging her heavy feet, she walked out of the alley and crossed a street. She was gradually moving her body towards the grocery market. With her head down, and with a belly full of sorrow, Ah Xing's obedient shadow kept shaking in her mind. She thought of how the child was covered in red spots, how he coughed, how he closed his eyes, how he left his mother, whose life was surrounded by thorns. How she took Ah Xing's body to be placed in the corner of the grocery market at dawn...Ah, yesterday morning, the weather was very quiet, so quiet that it was a little desolate, but late last night, suddenly, there was the sound of large raindrops. Aunt Yang couldn't close her eyes, listening to the raindrops, she tossed and turned on the floor, adding a lot of worries and sorrows.

"Hey, move aside..." A manure cart came rumbling towards Aunt Yang's face, the rough voice of the driver woke Aunt Yang, she quickly dodged and stepped onto the sidewalk, but her feet seemed to be stuck in the mud, unable to move forward. A few steps ahead was the grocery market, housewives and older women were constantly coming and going...

Ah Xing's body was placed there, the electric pole with a crying face had grabbed Aunt Yang's sight. Aunt Yang wanted to move forward a few steps, but she didn't seem to want to see her child's body, because it would make her even more heartbroken! But finally, she walked forward.

The weather was very gloomy, with drizzle falling, Aunt Yang's eyes were wet, she leaned weakly on the electric pole and began to sob and weep. A small corpse was in front of her, it was her only child, it was the image that she had placed all her hopes on! She was annoyed, why didn't she pawn that blue quilt and buy a coffin for Ah Xing? Otherwise, at least Ah Xing's body would not be covered with stains, and, alas, the skin of his whole body was wrinkled and covered with wrinkles after being soaked in the rain all night. A piece of pale white, a piece of purple and black color, were intertwined, just like the grief and resentment in Aunt Yang's heart.

Thinking of the unfinished business, seeing that some people had already filled their baskets and returned, Aunt Yang couldn't stay any longer. She wiped away her tears, but the tears still gushed out like a spring, a square cloth was completely soaked, she wanted to hold it back, while groping in her pocket for money, her eyes were covered with tears, very hazy, she cautiously put the distance between the money and her eyes very close, looked at it, it was six yuan, not less...

Suddenly, a hand stretched out from behind, Aunt Yang screamed, and then shouted "Robbery, robbery" and chased after him. Aunt Yang had small feet, and there were many onlookers on the side of the road. Although everyone couldn't help but sympathize with the maid who was robbed, they still let Aunt Yang watch the robber run into the alley indistinctly. Aunt Yang's pace slowed down, the six yuan could not be recovered. Alas, she could only pay with tears, she squatted and howled like a madman, and many passers-by were attracted by curiosity, forming a circle around Aunt Yang.

Tears were flowing, the child who died at the fifth watch yesterday morning was lying under the electric pole not far away, six yuan was lost, the master's scolding was her duty, compensation, if the master forced Aunt Yang to pay out these six yuan, or even stopped Aunt Yang's job, this...

The people around were crowded, Aunt Yang was still crying.

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(6) Product of Love

"Xiangqi's plan is right," but his mind was clearly not focused on the newspaper. "Without waiting to go back, I've decided to write a letter to my uncle." His thoughts began to race. "Sending thirty yuan down, the old man will definitely be happy… Acting was never meant to be a long-term career; being able to acquire some property in the countryside is precisely what the ancients called planning ahead, nothing could be better: moreover, there is such a beautiful and gentle companion… "

Although he didn't pay attention to the news in the paper, his hands were still unconsciously moving, and in a moment, he had flipped the two newspapers to the last page.

"…What I'm still afraid of is once things come to light, old Yuan will send people to search the four townships of Cangzhou…!" His second thought was barely halfway through when the mute maid came back in, interrupting him.

Her face was still plastered with a strangely amusing naive smile, first tugging at the corner of his clothes, then pointing outside with her right hand, followed by a flurry of hand-waving. Autumn Begonia thought Xiangqi was calling him, so he put down the newspaper, intending to go out, but the little girl shook her head even more violently, even shaking her head along with it.

"I don't understand! What do you mean?" Autumn Begonia asked her, trying to hold back a laugh.

She still pointed outside first, then shook her hands repeatedly, but this time she added a gesture, which was to hold up her index finger on her right hand and wave it in front of him. Autumn Begonia saw it and knew it represented "one," but one what? One basket of coal, or one person?

In reality, it did indeed represent one person, it's just that the mute girl couldn't say it. Xiangqi, because someone had just arrived outside, absolutely didn't want Autumn Begonia to run into him, so she specially used sign language to inform her mute maid, telling her to come in and tell Autumn Begonia not to go out; but Autumn Begonia didn't understand her gestures, and at the same time, the girl was young and couldn't immediately grasp the seriousness of the situation. She saw Autumn Begonia put down the newspaper and intend to step out of the hall to find Xiangqi, and although she felt he had misunderstood her meaning, she was too shy to reach out and stop him, and she really didn't know what major consequences would occur if Autumn Begonia encountered this person, otherwise she would certainly have tried her best to stop him.

### Everyone Knows the Truth

— Jiang Bo

The price of coal briquettes has soared from eight yuan per load to sixteen yuan, and wholesale prices have broken the three hundred yuan per ton mark. This is a rare phenomenon in the isolated city recently. No wonder the panic about rice prices has subsided slightly. Now, what is causing an uproar among the civilians of the isolated city is the coal briquette problem again.

Speaking of the skyrocketing price of coal briquettes, we should not forget the large advertisements published in the newspapers a few days ago, urging "account holders" who have coal briquette warehouse receipts to quickly release their goods in order to clear the warehouses; soon after, they openly announced a price increase; but it is said that this is not like the "unreasonable" price increases of daily necessities on the market, or "hoarding" and other situations. There are many reasons worth lamenting, which can be summarized as follows: shipping costs have risen sharply, reportedly from three US dollars per ton to fourteen US dollars, which is naturally an important reason; also, the reserves in the isolated city are meager, implying a "supply shortage," which is also a hardship; furthermore, labor costs have increased, as have the prices of metal products and coal seams, and so on. Under all sorts of petitions, it seems that a "slight price increase" is needed to supplement revenue.

However, according to those familiar with the industry, the four reasons put forward by the coal merchants in their announcement are indeed all true, but as far as the current coal market is concerned, goods with a freight rate of thirteen or fourteen US dollars per ton have not yet arrived at the port. As for the "meager reserves," it is only due to the refusal to circulate goods, which has led to a daily shortage of goods on the market. The increase in labor and raw material costs is certainly also a fact, but in any case, this is their best excuse. Understanding this, the hidden truth behind this major price increase resulting from a "slight price increase" is "eating fireflies in the belly" and "everyone knows the truth."

Here's a further point: originally, the main raw material for coal briquettes was Hongji No. 1 coal dust, but due to the increase in coal prices, the main ingredient of coal briquettes has shifted from No. 1 to No. 2, and most recently, it is said that Korean white coal dust has been mostly used, so that when burning it at home, the kitchen only smells of foul odor, which is clear evidence.

Thoroughly investigate the reserves, punish manipulation and hoarding. For the sake of the lives of all the people in the isolated city and the public order of the entire isolated city, this is what we expect from the authorities!

### Yu Guang and Li Hong Marry Today

— Mei Hua

Striving for success after love's failure - achievement in career and triumph in love

Yu Guang and Li Hong's marriage today is not entirely unexpected.

As long as he isn't a penniless man, a young man who is frustrated in love must always find a way to heal the wounds in his heart.

A few years ago, everyone thought so - Yu Guang and Mei Lin were the happiest couple in the film industry. At that time, Yu Guang was a popular young leading man at Dayi, and Mei Lin was a promising actress at Lianhua, and both were young and relatively well-off financially. What storms could possibly change their blissful life?

However, change finally came.

That was after the rise of sound films. Yu Guang and Mei Lin were similarly affected by their lack of fluency in Mandarin, and were both squeezed out of the film circle; in other words, their works gradually decreased and eventually became invisible.

If they were other movie stars, perhaps they would not have changed their original state, at least not on the surface. Yu Guang would still ride his motorcycle, with Mei Lin sitting behind him, and their appearance would still be quite impressive.

I remember their new nest was built on the edge of the Racecourse Road, on the upper floor of Dr. Yan's residence. In the summer, when passing by the Racecourse, if you looked up, you could sometimes see them being intimate in the window.

However, they finally separated. And they separated after Mei Lin became associated with Yan, which shows that the change between them was not for economic reasons.

Yu Guang was stimulated by this and began to work hard in his career.

However, in love, Mei Lin was considered to have won, and Yu Guang was considered to have failed.

Perhaps in order to prove himself, Yu Guang's career has shown an upward trend. As a result, his car often frequented the Zhaofeng Villa. In fact, at that time, the person he was pursuing was not Li Hong, but Miss Wang, who lived in the same room as Li Hong, because they lived in the same house, Yu Guang had to take care of both sides when he went there, which is human nature, but in the narrow minds of women, it is unforgivable. Therefore, Li Hong and Miss Wang often quarreled because of this.

Later, Miss Wang disappeared, and Yu Guang still often went to the Zhaofeng Villa. This time, he was purely visiting Li Hong.

Li Hong is an emotional girl, and Yu Guang has a bit of an "offensive towards Mei Lin" attitude, and their friendship has soared like a mercury column.

Today, the auditorium of the YMCA on Baixianqiao is extraordinarily splendid and full of dazzling stars. In addition, there are movie fans visiting, and the grand occasion is conceivable.

### "A Young Phoenix's First Cry"

— Li Du

It is said that she is Diana Durbin's strong rival

Susanna Foster, the leading actress in "A Young Phoenix's First Cry", is praised by producers as being second only to Diana Durbin. Although her voice is not as bright as Durbin's, her melodious tones are no less than Durbin's, but I think what is worth praising is still her acting skills.

In this play, she plays a bad girl. She is smart, clever, and also rude and arrogant, but in the end, influenced by many of her classmates, she becomes a lovely little girl, but still retains her innocent personality. This role is very suitable for her identity. Under the excellent handling of the director, she plays it very lovely. I love her imitations of Deanna Durbin and Marlene Dietrich's singing the most. She not only learned their voices, but also learned their expressions.

As far as the story itself is concerned, there is nothing special about it. A little actress is discovered to have a singing talent, and she is forced to stay in a youth music camp. This music camp is suffering from economic difficulties, and finally gets relief through her singing. You can imagine the rest of such a story after seeing half of it, but under the clever handling of the director, there are often some unexpected developments. For example, when the little actress is first discovered, he focuses on the actress's performance on stage, and then, when many audiences are in high spirits, there is a sudden killjoy from the detectives, followed by the audience dispersing like birds and beasts, and the actress escaping from the window. When one of the audience members, Alex Jones, gets into the car, he finds the actress in the car. The performance form is very funny, and the development of the plot is also very fascinating. Also, the little actress refuses to abide by the rules in the music camp, and still shows her "vulgar" habits from time to time, which are all the adorable parts of the director.

There are opera performances and youth music performances in the film, which are all magnificent scenes. It is a pity that these scenes, although not wasteful, are not the most exciting parts. It is said that several of the young award winners are refugees from Poland and other countries in this war. Their performances are truly their own performances, and not done by others. Although this is not related to the plot, it also shows the depth of their musical achievements.

### Drama News

Every time northern opera actors come south, the Shanghai Drama School holds a welcome party. Xun Huisheng is one of the four famous Dan actresses, so of course there can be no exception. At 3:30 yesterday afternoon, the school prepared refreshments and invited Huisheng and several related guests. Huisheng, because he had other engagements, was delayed until 4:00 before he came with E Lvgong and Shu Sheyu. Principal Chen Chengyin greeted them and invited them to be seated. First, he gave a welcome speech, and then asked Huisheng to give a speech to the students standing in attention. His general idea was: "My own success also came from struggling through hardships, but after becoming famous, you must not be complacent, arrogant, and self-satisfied, because this is enough to hinder the progress of art." The guests who spoke included E Lvgong and Shu Shuyu, etc. Finally, the chairman of the school board, Xu Xiaochu, gave a reply. Originally, the school had also prepared a cappella performances to add to the fun, but they were canceled because it was too late. Principal Chen also solemnly introduced Guan Zhengming and Gu Zhengqiu, two outstanding students, to Huisheng. Huisheng was very happy with Gu Zhengqiu and said, "This child is really smart!" After Huisheng and the guests visited the classrooms, they took their leave and left.

Then he said: "Thank you for thinking so highly of me and asking me to follow you in conspiring to do great things. But firstly, I, Li, am untalented and incapable. Even if I join your group, it will be useless. Secondly, I feel that I am not a hero. How can I fulfill your sister's wishes? I'm sorry, I can't agree. In short, I, Li, am an honest and upright citizen. How can I be willing to be a thief and be scolded by others? Moreover, I already have a wife at home, and I don't want to be married to a female bandit. Please stop this delusion." After speaking, he gave a cold laugh. Seeing that Li Xin said it so categorically, clearly looking down on himself, Tong Tianbao felt a little unable to restrain himself in his heart. His face darkened and he said loudly: "Young Master Li, you keep saying that we are bandits. You must know that although we are in the Green Forest, we have great ambitions. Don't look down on us as worthless. We have persuaded you twice, which is really looking up to you. My sister marrying you, is it insulting you? This is all my sister's kindness to you. Don't be ungrateful! If it were me, you can agree, or if you don't agree, I will cut you in half, quickly." When Li Xin heard this, he couldn't help but feel angry, so he scolded: "Bandits, since I have come here, I didn't want to return alive. A real man only dies once. You can kill me quickly, and someone will avenge me and clean you up in the future. Why do you need to show off your power to me? I regret that I didn't tie you up and send you to the officials when you were at my manor, so that I left behind a source of trouble." Tong Tianbao shouted "Wow ya ya", stood up, kicked the stool over with one foot, pointed at Li Xin and scolded: "Li, you are really ignorant of flattery. Now it's too late for you to regret it. Since you want to die, I will send you to the gate of hell." Saying this, he turned around and shouted to the outside of the door "My lads"! The outside responded, and then two bandits walked into the room. Tong Tianbao waved his hand and said: "Quick, take this Li out and behead him, and bring his head for inspection!" The two said yes, quickly stepped forward, grabbed Li Xin on both sides, and immediately pushed him out of the room to be executed. (End of Chapter 5)
