### US Will Announce Total Embargo, To Confer with Australia on Cooperative Aid to China

Hopes for the Resumption of Trade Negotiations Between the US and Japan Dashed; Netherlands Indies and Hong Kong Strengthen the Effectiveness of Export Restrictions

Havas News Agency, Washington, 20th - According to well-informed sources, the US government will soon announce a total embargo on various raw materials. President Roosevelt yesterday further expanded the list of embargoed goods, adding six categories including fur, mixed fibers, asphalt, raw asphalt, non-ferrous metals, and precious metals. This restriction is expected to take effect around September 10th. Responsible officials stated that while US-controlled export trade will reach approximately 80%, a total embargo will still be implemented soon. The underlying reason is to ensure an adequate supply of raw materials needed for the US defense industry, so that the US can fulfill its obligations to China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Pan-American countries. It is said that Japan will be the most affected by the implementation of this restriction, while China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Pan-American countries will be given priority.

London, 20th - According to reliable sources, although the reaction to the Netherlands Indies' freezing of Japanese assets and imposing an economic blockade has been moderate, Dutch officials still believe that Japan's occupation of Vietnam is a direct threat to the security of the Netherlands Indies. Therefore, all items that could enhance Japan's war economy are prohibited from export.

United Press, Washington, 21st - Authorities here believed yesterday that Australia and the United States have been engaged in diplomatic discussions regarding cooperation in China. This news was disclosed following a meeting on Tuesday night between the Australian Minister to Washington, Casey, Under Secretary of State Welles, and Presidential Administrative Assistant Currie. Casey and State Department officials declined to reveal the purpose of the meeting. However, one responsible party stated that Currie's involvement must relate to aid to China. Unofficial speculation suggests that this aid will include steel, cement, and aircraft parts commonly used for the Burma Road or the parallel railway currently under construction.

Havas News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - It was recently learned from well-informed sources that an attempt to establish temporary measures to ease the current strained relations between Japan and the United States through negotiations between Tokyo and Washington has failed. The two sides have met no less than fifteen times, but each has insisted on its own position, refusing to concede. Two days ago, the US government, through Ambassador Grew, notified the Japanese government that if Japan does not modify its attitude, the current negotiations are unlikely to succeed. Therefore, the hope for the resumption of trade between the two countries will also vanish, and the established facts of frozen funds and restrictions on Pacific trade will be extended indefinitely and will no longer be temporary measures. Responsible parties in Tokyo are also extremely nervous. The frequent contacts between US Ambassador Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda and Vice Foreign Minister Terasaki prove the urgency of the situation. In addition, widespread rumors that negotiations between the two sides on the issue of the withdrawal of American citizens have stalled have further unsettled the local American community. Since the US and Japan mutually imposed freezing measures, the two sides have begun negotiations in an attempt to establish temporary measures, not only on economic matters but also on political issues, seeking a basis for resolution, at least hoping to guarantee several months of peace between the US and Japan. It is said that the United States has adopted a firm attitude in the negotiations. Although some appeasement measures may be taken economically, certain conditions must be obtained politically, namely, Japan must truly retreat. According to the views of neutral observers, the situation in the Far East has completely changed, because the two Anglo-Saxon powers have now taken the initiative and have abandoned the appeasement concept of the past two years. In Japan, on the contrary, a defensive stance has been adopted, and its situation is becoming increasingly isolated. The "encirclement policy" mentioned by the Japanese is no longer just a slogan of the propaganda machine, but a terrifying reality. Furthermore, according to repeated statements from those close to the government, if Britain and the United States continue to tighten the encirclement of Japan, Japan will be forced to take extreme measures. It would be a mistake for outsiders to regard this as purely propaganda, because, according to Japan's claim, based on the experience of the past few years, especially the experience of the sanctions imposed on Italy in 1935, it would rather break through the blockade than submit to suffocation. At the same time, neutral observers who know the national character of Japan also said that Japan is the same as Italy, its endurance is great, but once a decision is made, it will disregard everything.

### Red Lights Hang North and South, Japan is Already Aware of Being Surrounded

Reuters, Washington, 21st - As the world's resistance to Nazism and aggression has reached a consensus, attention here has refocused on the Far East, and Japan's extraordinary strategy of preventing American citizens from leaving the country is particularly noteworthy. Fortunately, the American people's attention to the Far East has been heightened. It is widely felt that in recent weeks, especially after the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, the world situation has greatly changed. China, Britain, and the Soviet Union are now all fighting, the Netherlands Indies is preparing for war, and the United States remains a non-belligerent ally. The United States' moral support for the Soviet Union is now gradually turning into material assistance. Therefore, Japan's position in the East is deteriorating day by day. As the New York Times said, red lights hang north and south to guard against Japan, and Japan's hope that it can proceed with its steps without being punished must have been extinguished in the long talks between Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda and US Ambassador Grew on Sunday. The New York Times also said that there is good reason to believe that US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill have decided on a joint course of action to deal with Japan's new steps. According to observations here, Japan's next step is to join the world war, but Japan is now worried about being in a situation where it will encounter major resistance everywhere, and it will encounter a combined military force that it cannot cope with safely. Japan cannot obtain the slightest assistance from its Axis allies, and it is also gradually realizing that it is useless to be a tool for others, or it may not dare to act rashly. One thing that observers here have noted is that as the strong front of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States has developed, Japanese newspapers have said that Britain and the United States are currently destroying the neutrality treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, and that Japan and the Soviet Union are now trying to strengthen their peaceful relations. But then, is Japan's recent dispatch of large forces to Manchuria and Mongolia a proposal to strengthen peaceful relations between Japan and the Soviet Union? Japan is indeed surrounded today, but it is surrounded by its own unassisted efforts. According to the sentiments here, even the most ardent advocates of war in Tokyo must know that the strength of one country alone cannot compete with the five countries of China, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands Indies, Britain, and the United States.

### Britain Claims No Consideration Given to Unfreezing Japanese Funds

Reuters, London, 20th - Responsible parties in London stated yesterday that there is currently no question of Britain and Japan concluding a barter agreement or unfreezing Japanese funds. The banking mechanism established between the Bank of England and the Yokohama Specie Bank is merely to prepare for the special issuance of trade licenses in special circumstances. Each license must have its value in terms of British supply, and the consideration of supply must conflict with the consideration of economic warfare. It would be a mistake to refer to this mechanism as an appeasement measure. The measures agreed upon by the Bank of England and the Yokohama Specie Bank do not change the situation announced recently in the House of Commons by British Foreign Secretary Eden. The current measures stipulate the basis on which licenses can be issued, but this basis is extremely narrow. When the freezing of Japanese funds was announced, it was already known that licenses could be issued in some limited circumstances, but this kind of transaction must be very limited, for two reasons: 1. Export goods from Britain to Japan cannot be shipped out if their value exceeds the value of Japanese imports that the British authorities deem appropriate. 2. Britain is not bound by any goods, and Britain does not have the obligation to supply the British goods that Japan wants to obtain.

United Press, London, 21st - Authorities here said yesterday that under the measures currently under discussion, "Japanese earnings from the frozen funds will be no more than a few thousand pounds." It is understood that the normal turnover of trade between Britain and Japan in peacetime is about 7 million pounds. Officials declared that the current measures are purely to assist British and Japanese embassies and consulates, and there is no intention to expand this kind of convenience. Officials declared that Britain has not issued export permits to Japan since the funds were frozen. Authorities insisted, "Britain has adopted an extremely stern attitude towards any action by Japan in the Far East. Britain has taken full defense measures in Malaya and elsewhere." Authorities said that Britain has not given Thailand a special guarantee of armed support, but there is no doubt as to what the British sentiment is.

Hong Kong, 21st - The Hong Kong government has recently ordered the expansion of the area for the shipment of export goods, in addition to Germany and its occupied areas, Japan and its territories, mandated territories, and Manchuria are also included. The Hong Kong government issued this to strengthen the effectiveness of its measures against Japan.

### Japanese Finance Minister Discusses Current Financial Crisis

Bus Service to be Banned from September; Rice and Bread Also to be Rationed

Reuters, Tokyo, 21st - Most newspapers here have detailed the Finance Minister's speech at the Tokyo Bankers Club, regarding the financial crisis and domestic countermeasures. As for Thailand and other international issues, there has been no progress, so they do not occupy an important place in the report.

Reuters, Tokyo, 21st - The Japanese government has decided to ban the use of gasoline-powered streetcars, buses, and private cars from September 1st in order to preserve the gasoline supply. However, private cars used for special accidents are exempt from the ban. Buses that do not use gasoline as fuel can operate as usual, but bus stops will be abolished.

Reuters, Bombay, 21st - An Indian who arrived here yesterday from Japan on a Japanese ship said that bread is not sold in Japan for six days each month, and that butter and cheese are supplied in small quantities and are quite expensive. Rice and bread have already been rationed. There were a total of 40 Indian passengers on board the ship.

### Rumors of Martial Law Declared by Britain in Syria

United Press, Vichy, 21st - Parisian newspapers yesterday carried a news report from Ankara saying that Britain has declared martial law throughout Syria. It is said that this declaration of martial law by Britain was made after the conflict between British troops and Arab soldiers in Aleppo.

### French Diplomatic Personnel Pledge Allegiance to Free France

United Press, San Jose, Costa Rica, 21st - The French Consul and the Secretary of the French Embassy here resigned yesterday to the Vichy government and accepted the same positions appointed by General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French movement.

### Rumors of Six Steps Agreed Upon by Britain and the United States

International News Service, Washington, 21st - According to reliable sources revealed today, Britain and the United States have agreed on a six-point plan regarding Germany: (1) To provide as much material assistance to the Soviet Union as possible, and encourage the Soviet Union to continue resisting Germany. (2) To continue to aid China and intensify the encirclement of Japan. (3) To greatly increase British forces in the Mediterranean region to prevent the German army from launching an offensive in the region. (4) To quickly increase US aid to Britain and expand the British air force. (5) If necessary, to occupy Iran, Daga, Athos Islands, Cape Verde, and even Turkey before the German army. (6) In the present and coming years, Britain will mainly adopt a defensive position against Germany, and in 1943, it will launch an offensive against Europe. The above six-point plan represents the results of the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting.

Editorial

### The Factor of Time

Recently, President Roosevelt, upon returning from his sea voyage, met with reporters and pointed out that this war would be a long and arduous one, warning the people not to be overly optimistic about current achievements, and also indicating that the war may continue until the end of 1943. The United States is currently considering the needs of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union in the next two years and how the United States can supply them. At the same time, within Italian Fascism, there has recently been some controversy regarding the duration of the European war. On the 19th, the Fascist political system newspaper published an editorial severely criticizing the view of some people in Italian political circles that the European war would be extended for ten years, stating that if after ten years of war, both the victorious and defeated countries will be uninhabited. It can be seen that the time factor is an important factor in the current war, and both democratic countries and Axis countries are paying great attention to it.

It is not necessarily uncommon for a war to last for ten years. In European history, there were famous Thirty Years' War and Hundred Years' War. In the past few years, people who pay attention to current events in the Far East have probably heard similar grand pronouncements from time to time. However, those who dare to make grand pronouncements may not necessarily have the strength to match them, and the so-called Thirty Years' War and Hundred Years' War mostly refer to the sum of several non-continuous wars, and they were also events that occurred in the era when firearms were not yet widely used. With the great consumption and alarming destruction of modern warfare, it is naturally impossible to compare it with the concept of warfare in the Middle Ages. On this point, perhaps the Fascist view above is correct. But such an observation only touches the surface of the problem.

Generally speaking, aggressor nations benefit from a swift and decisive victory, while the resistance to aggression emphasizes protracted warfare. This strategic divergence is caused by different subjective conditions and has been decided since the beginning of the war. The "have" and "have-not" theory that the aggressors use as an excuse is meaningless, but in terms of waging war, today's aggressors are not countries with vast territories, large populations, and abundant resources. In order to obtain war materials, aggressors depend on the world market much more urgently than democratic countries, which hold world sea power and whose territories and countries span the globe. However, under the blockade and embargo of the opposing side, what they can obtain and apply is only the production of their homeland and occupied areas and the stockpiles of pre-war materials. With limited sources to supply endless consumption, it goes without saying that they cannot engage in long-term warfare. What's more, in addition to economic problems, the stability of the aggressor nations' regimes is mostly based on high-pressure rule and the establishment of external achievements. Expansion that cannot be achieved quickly and as desired will inevitably lead to the surfacing of internal latent crises. Sacrificing butter to make cannons may be understandable from the perspective of preparing for war, but at the same time, it also lays down a dangerous factor. In essence, the ultimate goal of the sacrifice is to obtain more butter. If the result only leads to long-term suffering and sacrifice, then the people's endurance of pain also has its greatest limit, especially since the aggressors have no reason to resort to war in the first place. Therefore, the views of the political system newspaper are essentially an expression of depression, which is the common depression of all countries in a situation similar to that of Italy.

However, in Nazi Germany, the recent situation seems to be that, although it is no longer the arrogant and reckless behavior after the great victory on the Western Front last summer, its offensive strength has not yet reached the stage of exhaustion. In the recent Soviet-German war, the strong will of the Germanic nation is being demonstrated and is still constantly progressing, but it is still a huge and difficult task. At the same time, even though the Nazis are also eager for a swift and decisive victory, at present, the above-mentioned factors have not caused serious damage to their war machine. This is probably why President Roosevelt wants to warn the American people about a long-term war. Based on the experience of the past few years, whether in the East or the West, the time factor has played a major role. The current situation may not be entirely satisfactory, but it cannot be denied that there has been significant progress in this long process. Recently, the international situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and there are signs of approaching a final settlement, but the use of time should still not be taken lightly. On the other hand, it is important not to be overly obsessed with the idea of a swift victory, and to neglect how to allow the aggressors to continue to suffer from the impact of the time factor. The counter-offensive against the aggressors is what the world is eagerly hoping for, but the conditions for the maturity of the counter-offensive still depend on the greater consumption of the opposing side and the continued strengthening of one's own strength. Today, in the world's three major wars, the situation in the Far East has become a stalemate, the main force has not yet clashed in Western Europe, and in Eastern Europe, both sides are using all their strength to fight for space and time. As for the various aggressor nations, their combat power may still be superior, but the three conditions of land, people, and resources are beyond the reach of the anti-aggression front. Their peace offensive, attempting to take risks to achieve their goals, is an expression of anxiety and impatience, and it is also the embarrassing state exposed under the heavy pressure of time. The central issue at present is not local victory or defeat and advance or retreat, but how to target the objective situation of all parties so that the aggressors can be fatally struck at the appropriate time.

Regardless of whether the war will truly continue until the end of 1943, the anti-aggression nations must have the determination to fight a long and hard battle. This is the underlying meaning of President Roosevelt's remarks. The sacrifice and destruction of war are inevitable, but the end of a long-term war is definitely not that both warring countries become uninhabited, but rather the destruction of the aggressors and the extinction of the crimes of aggression.

### Japanese Plane That Attacked Zhongxian Shot Down by China

All Four People on Board Died; Liuzhou and Hengyang Also Attacked

Chongqing, 19th - A Japanese army plane that attacked Zhongxian was shot down by Chinese anti-aircraft units and crashed near Fengjie. The Japanese side acknowledged this on the 20th in a broadcast. The personnel on the plane were Lieutenant Matsumoto Zensaku, Sergeant Major Okawa, Sergeant Shizaki, and Corporal Ishiguchi, all four of whom also died. (21st dispatch)

Guilin - Thirty-one Japanese planes invaded Liuzhou this afternoon in two batches from Vietnam, dropping bombs in the north and south of Henan, destroying many civilian houses. Longzhou was also bombed this afternoon. (20th dispatch)

Hengyang - Twenty-six Japanese planes attacked Hengyang from Hubei on the morning of the 20th. After intense anti-aircraft fire, the Japanese planes dropped bombs in the suburbs and escaped by the original route. (20th dispatch)

Chongqing - In the past few days, Japanese planes flying from bases in northern Vietnam have increased their activity in southwestern China. In addition to the air raid on Kunming, points along the Burma Road have also been bombed. It is reported that 31 Japanese planes bombed Liuzhou in southern Guangxi yesterday, and Qinzhou on the Vietnamese border was also attacked. Twenty-six Japanese planes bombed Hengyang in southern Hunan yesterday morning. It is believed that these Japanese planes came from Hankou. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing - Today, Chinese sources said that Kunming recently suffered the longest air raid. President Chiang Kai-shek has allocated 300,000 yuan to relieve the families of the victims. From August 9th to 17th, Japanese planes bombed Kunming six times in eight days. (21st United Press dispatch)

### British and American Nationals Withdraw from Manchuria and Arrive in Tianjin

British and American Embassies Say They Know Nothing; Japanese Say All Foreigners are Not Allowed to Enter Manchuria

Beiping - It was learned today that regarding the withdrawal of British and American nationals from Manchuria, the British and American embassies have not received any news. The embassies said that they have not been notified that British and American nationals have withdrawn from Manchuria because their businesses have been completely suspended due to the freezing orders. Japanese sources said that more than 100 British and American nationals have withdrawn from Manchuria - especially Harbin - and will arrive in Tianjin today. Japanese sources also said that British and American nationals have left Manchuria because their businesses have been completely suspended, taking advantage of the Japanese order allowing foreigners to leave Manchuria before August 18th. At present, all foreigners, regardless of whether they had previously resided in Manchuria, are not allowed to enter Manchuria. (21st United Press dispatch)

### Rice Prices Plummet in Sichuan Province

Measures for Fixing Prices and Purchasing Rice Announced; 12 Million Piculs Can be Obtained Annually

Chongqing - Rice prices have plummeted in various parts of Sichuan Province. According to the Ministry of Food, this is mostly due to hoarders selling off their stocks in large quantities when they saw the new grain coming onto the market. In the previous two weeks, rice prices in various places fell by between 40 and 100 yuan per picul. The current lowest price is 104 yuan per picul, and the highest price is 245 yuan per picul in Chongqing. The Sichuan Provincial Government has announced a resolution to forcibly requisition and purchase grain in the province, estimating that each county will supply 200,000 piculs of grain, half to be used for land tax and the remainder to be purchased by the government. The government has decided to pay 30% in cash for the purchases, and the remaining 70% will be paid in food storage coupons. The cotton harvest in Shaanxi Province this year is quite good, with a total of 2 million mu of land planted with cotton. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing - The measures for fixing prices and purchasing rice in Sichuan Province have recently been announced. For every picul of grain submitted by farmers, they will receive 7斗 of food storage coupons and 30 yuan in legal tender. According to government estimates, Sichuan Province can purchase 6 million piculs of grain in accordance with this measure, and another 6 million piculs can be obtained through the actual levy of land tax, for a total of 12 million piculs. Also, according to this fixed price, it is no different from the government currently fixing the grain price at 100 yuan per picul, which is equivalent to a rice price of 200 yuan. However, according to a survey by the authorities, in early July, the highest rice price in various counties of Sichuan Province was 451 yuan in Nanchong, and the lowest was 110 yuan in Xiushan. Subsequently, when the new grain came onto the market, the price fell by between 5 yuan and 140 yuan per picul. Therefore, the current highest market price is 349 yuan in Nanchong, and the lowest is still in Xiushan, at 104 yuan. On average, it is 250 yuan per picul. Yesterday, the rice price in Chongqing was 140 yuan, 260 yuan in Chengdu, and 280 yuan in the Zigong area. These three places are the most heavily consumed areas in Sichuan Province. More than a month ago, there were several panic phenomena, but they have now stabilized. (21st Havas World News Agency dispatch)

### English Newspaper Praises China: People's Unity and Strong Will

Will Occupy an Important Position in the Future World Organization: The US-UK Talks Did Not Neglect the Issue of Aid to China

Reuter's, London, 21st: The Times newspaper published an article praising China's strength and resilience in combat, stating that under the stimulation of common danger and the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, China has emerged from years of internal strife and anarchy. The Chinese people are increasingly united and their will is strengthened as they struggle to preserve their country's existence. The Chinese army is now very complete, and its sophisticated tactics have forced the attacks of the better-equipped Japanese mechanized army into a stalemate. The recent bombing of Chongqing does not seem to have had any effect on the military situation. The Chinese people have suffered greatly and endured hardships for a long time, and no form of threat is sufficient to shake their will. Looking around the world, it is doubtful whether any other country has such a firm belief in final victory as China. In Japan's various changing and eccentric policies, China has always been its main priority and greatest concern. This Japanese policy has been in place for fifty years. The report further stated that the recent development of Japan's increased military strength in the South is partly due to the Japanese army's desire to regain the face lost by its long failure to end the China incident, but also to seal off China in the South, cut off the few supply routes that still continue, and force China to submit, because Vietnam is now a base for strengthening military operations against China and a starting point for Japan's continued advance south. Although President Roosevelt and the British government have made it clear that all threats and sweet words that would induce them to sacrifice China and negotiate with Japan are equally insignificant, the leaders of Japanese policy have never given up hope of using more direct threats to British and American interests elsewhere to force the two countries to tacitly recognize Japan's hegemony in China. The report also stated that China's greatest asset is its invincible will to resist, followed by the sympathy and assistance of countries other than Japan that have interests in the Far East. As for Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, on the whole, China may have benefited from its heartfelt trust in the resumption of aid to the Soviet Union. At present, a strong Soviet army is stationed in eastern Siberia, ready to resist any Japanese actions in the area. The Chinese and Soviet armies have now become part of a great fortress against Japan's continued advance. Today, it is no exaggeration to speak of the entire defensive line, because the Japanese policy itself extends from the Amur River (Heilongjiang) through China to Thailand and Singapore and as far as the Dutch East Indies. The report strongly stated that the British policy in the Far East is completely in line with that of the United States. British direct aid to China is limited only by Britain's own urgent needs. At present, we can speculate that the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting will certainly not ignore the issue of aid to China. The report concluded that China will occupy an extremely important position in the future organization of the world.

### The Three-Power Conference Will Discuss the Issue of Material Assistance

It is Said That the United States Intends to Lend Money to the Soviet Union: Thousands of Tons of Machine Tools Will Be Shipped Immediately

Reuter's, London, 21st: A Reuter's diplomatic correspondent stated that the main issue facing the anti-Axis front today is to provide the Soviet Union with the greatest possible assistance without delay. This was one of the topics discussed by Roosevelt and Churchill at the meeting in the Atlantic, and it will also be the task of the three-country conference, which will be held soon in Moscow, in order to effectively carry out this task. As for the candidates for the British and American representatives attending the three-country conference, it has not yet been announced. This seems to confirm that Lord Beaverbrook will serve as the main British representative, and will go to Moscow as soon as his public affairs in the United States are completed. He is indeed very suitable for handling the specific issues of supply and distribution. Since the discussions of the three countries will be limited to goods and supplies, the participants in the meeting may not only be military representatives. It is heard that the American representative will be Harriman, who assisted in the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act to the United Kingdom. The United States is now showing signs of stepping up assistance to the Soviet Union, such as the suggestion that American bombers should fly from Alaska to Siberia and arrive on the Eastern Front. This move can not only save transportation time, but also allow the aircraft to immediately go into battle when they arrive, and its impact on the Soviet Union's air offensive is self-evident.

Reuter's, Washington, 21st: United States Federal Loan Administrator Jones told reporters yesterday that the United States is prepared to lend money to the Soviet Union to facilitate its purchase of war equipment in the United States. If the US authorities adopt aid to the Soviet Union as a policy, and the Soviet Union is unable to pay cash, then he thinks the United States can find a way to help them. He believes this is a loan rather than a lease method. The Soviet Union has not yet formally requested a loan, but there have already been hints of this.

United Press, New York, 21st: The World Telegram reported yesterday that thousands of tons of machine tools, now en route to Vancouver, are ready to be shipped to the Soviet Union. The report also stated that these machine tools were originally ordered by France and have now been resold to the Soviet Union. It is also said that the Soviet Union's purchase of these goods is a cash transaction.

### One German Plane Raids Iceland

United Press, Reykjavik, 21st: An American-made British "Tomahawk" fighter plane yesterday chased a German bomber flying over Iceland. The air raid alarm sounded here at 7:00 AM when the twin-engine bomber flew over the city, lasting for fifteen minutes. The huge bomber escaped into the clouds without dropping bombs. Yesterday was the first time a German bomber invaded the island since the United States occupied Iceland on July 7. The German bomber is expected to have flown 700 miles from its base in Norway.

Reuter's, Washington, 21st: Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that he had not heard the news that a German plane flew over Iceland and was driven away by a fighter plane. If this is true, then the fighter plane must be owned by the United Kingdom, because he knows that there are no American fighter planes in Iceland.

United Press, Washington, 21st: The Navy Department yesterday refused to comment on the Iceland air raid news, except to say that it did not use "Tomahawk" aircraft. A telegram from Reykjavik (the capital of Iceland) stated that the American-made "Tomahawk" fighter plane, or perhaps piloted by a British pilot, drove away a German bomber flying over Iceland yesterday morning. Although the Army Department uses "Tomahawk" aircraft, it refused to explain that the Army was the first to participate in the Navy's first batch to Iceland. The current number of American troops in Iceland is a military secret, but it is estimated to be 20,000. The highest number of British troops is between 60,000 and 80,000. It is heard that American giant transport ships carrying reinforcements arrived in Iceland on August 7.

### Oil Shortage in the Eastern United States: More Severe Controls Will Be Adopted

Reuter's, Washington, 21st: United States Petroleum Coordinator Davies claimed yesterday that the eastern states of the United States only have a ten-day supply of oil. The oil shortage in the East, which has long been expected, has now been realized. The situation can be considered serious, and a more severe control plan must be implemented in addition to the current oil distribution law.

### Canadian Prime Minister King Arrives in the UK

Reuter's, London, 21st: Canadian Prime Minister King arrived in London this morning. Dominion Minister Lord Cranborne, Aviation Minister Sinclair, Prime Minister Churchill's representative Thompson, and representatives of the Canadian government and army were all waiting at the station. After King arrived, he made a statement saying that the United Kingdom will surely achieve final victory, and said that his stay in the United Kingdom will not be very long. King then had a long talk with Prime Minister Churchill.

### Rumors That Japan Plans to Build Two Concentration Camps

Located in the Occupied Areas of China

United Press, New York, 21st: Mr. Jekel, the manager of a carpet company here, said yesterday that his business partner in the Far East recently telegraphed that the Japanese army is building two large concentration camps in the occupied areas of China for British and American people. American industrialists and exporters have been openly threatened with imprisonment. He also said that he went to Beidaihe during Easter last year and personally saw a concentration camp under construction.

### The US Navy Has Entered a Wartime State

Many Officials Tend to Participate in the War

United Press, on an American patrol ship in the Atlantic, 21st: After completing a ten-day trip yesterday, reporters learned that American warships are actually operating in a state of war, following President Roosevelt's instructions to maintain the tranquility of the sea route and maintain the United States' promise of supplies. Reporters spent ten days on the warship, sailing 2,600 miles. The cannons on the ship were ready to fight at any time. Wireless silence was maintained except in extremely serious circumstances. A curfew was implemented every night, and there were sensitive listening devices to prevent aircraft and submarines. The name of this device cannot be published due to naval restrictions. There are many people on board. The ship the reporter was on is one of the most powerful in the US Navy. The sentiment of those who advocate participating in the war is stronger in the Navy. The reporter met a Navy man who wrote on a large bomb, "This is reserved for Hitler." Other shells were similarly marked, to be enjoyed by German Aviation Minister Goering and German Propaganda Minister Goebbels.

### Duke of Kent to Arrive in the US Next Week

Roosevelt Decides to Host Him Personally

Reuter's, Ottawa, 21st: The Duke of Kent, the brother of the King of England, yesterday wore a miner's hat and clothes to inspect an Ontario gold mine for an hour, then changed out of the mine and put on the uniform of an air force commander, visited the miners' sports field, and then took a car for 38 miles and boarded a plane to Toronto.

Reuter's, Washington, 21st: President Roosevelt went to Hyde Park Villa today and will host the Duke of Kent, the brother of the King of England, there at the end of this week. On Sunday, the Duke of Kent will return to Washington with the President and stay at the White House. At that time, he will visit the national defense factories in Norfolk and Baltimore.

### Australian Interior Minister Delivers Farewell Broadcast

About to Leave Singapore

Singapore, 10th: Australian Interior Minister Foll delivered a farewell broadcast here tonight, saying, "After my trip here, I am convinced of two things: (1) Anyone who wants to attack Singapore must think twice; (2) The firmer the attitude of us and our allies, the less likely it is that war will occur in the Pacific." He and several Australian reporters will return to Australia.

### US Defense Expenditure Increases Sharply: Will Reach 50 Billion Yuan

The Ministry of Finance is Also Cooperating with British Officials to Reduce the British Dollar Burden

Reuter's, Washington, 21st: US defense program expenditure reached US$51,000,000,000 yesterday (equivalent to £12,750,000,000). With the expected second batch of Lend-Lease funding, the total will increase to more than US$55,000,000,000.

Reuter's, Washington, 21st: According to those responsible, the US Treasury Department is currently cooperating with British personnel to reduce the British dollar burden. The US Treasury Department is now planning a plan so that the US government can assume the obligation to pay for part of the orders placed by the United Kingdom in the United States before the Lend-Lease Act was established based on the Lend-Lease Act. However, it has not yet been decided how much of the payment the United States can receive. The Wall Street Journal claimed that the US government will be responsible for one-third of the payment, which is considered an exaggeration by well-informed sources here.

Reuter's, New York, 21st: A Wall Street Journal dispatch from Washington stated that one of the main points being discussed by British Cabinet member Beaverbrook and the US President is the issue of the United Kingdom paying for the value of national defense supplies ordered from the US when the Lend-Lease Act was not yet implemented. According to reliable sources, he has requested that it be valued at $1,500,000,000.

### Far East Aviation Expansion

Chongqing It is expected today that there will soon be an increase in American or Sino-American joint commercial aviation in the Far East. It is reported that Pan American Airlines will add four new S-43 aircraft to fly between Manila and Hong Kong and Manila and Singapore, so that the current service of once every two weeks can be increased to twice a week. China National Aviation Corporation will have six new Douglas DC-3 aircraft added to fly on various routes in China, greatly increasing its passenger and cargo capacity. Traffic on the above-mentioned airlines has greatly increased, and there is a lack of sufficient aircraft to cope with it, so it is very crowded. After the addition of new aircraft, congestion can be slightly reduced (United Press, 21st)

It is also learned that Chairman Chiang is about to go to Moscow to discuss with Soviet military leaders the issue of China and the Soviet Union being smart to resist Japan.

### The Focus of the Soviet-German War Remains in the Central Gomel Region

German forces are likely to advance north, eyeing Moscow. Finnish forces make little progress in attacking Leningrad.

Moscow, TASS, 21st: Fierce fighting continued along the entire Soviet-German front on the night of the 18th and the morning of the 19th, especially in the central Gomel and Novgorod sectors.

London, Reuters, 21st: A new major battle is underway in the Gomel region of Soviet Byelorussia (175 miles southwest of Smolensk, 140 miles northeast of Kiev). Recent Soviet communiqués only mention fierce fighting in this area yesterday. A special communiqué from Hitler's headquarters states: "The battles around and north of Gomel have ended. The Soviet forces have been heavily defeated. The 17th Infantry Division, the 1st Mechanized Corps, the 2nd Armored Divisions, the 5th Cavalry Divisions, and a portion of two Airborne Brigades have been defeated, annihilated, or captured by the German forces. The German forces captured 78,000 enemy soldiers, seized 144 tanks, 700 artillery pieces, and two armored trains." The direction of the new German offensive in the Gomel region is still unclear, likely aiming north to assist the central sector and eye Moscow. It is also possible that the German forces, stalled around Smolensk, are initiating a new offensive to invade Ukraine.

Details of continuous Soviet counterattacks around Smolensk have recently emerged from Moscow. According to a Soviet newspaper, a Soviet unit突进, overcoming five villages and inflicting heavy damage on the German forces. Another report states that a unit of soldiers, surrounded west of 斯克 six weeks ago, has now broken through,冲过 the German lines for 200 miles, and rejoined the main force led by General Timoshenko. The German side previously claimed to have occupied all of Ukraine west of the Dnieper River, but now admits that many Soviet troops are still fiercely resisting in this area. German forces on the northern front are continuing to advance through Novgorod towards Leningrad, which is 100 miles to the northwest of that city. Fighting is also ongoing at Kingisepp on the Estonian border. Finnish forces, looking south towards Leningrad, have made little progress and admit that Soviet forces are counterattacking.

The Soviet Information Bureau issued the following communiqué at midnight: On August 10th, Soviet forces engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy at Kingisepp (70 miles southwest of Leningrad), Novgorod (100 miles southeast of Leningrad), Staraya Russa (south of Lake Ilmen), Gomel (175 miles southwest of Smolensk), and Odessa. According to confirmed reports, 28 enemy aircraft were shot down in air battles on August 18th. The previous figure of 30 was inaccurate. On August 19th, 27 enemy aircraft were shot down in air battles, with the Soviets losing 8 aircraft. On the afternoon of August 20th, Soviet fighter planes shot down three German reconnaissance planes near Moscow.

Moscow, Reuters, 21st: The Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Northern Front, Voroshilov, the leader of the Leningrad region, Zhdanov, and the Mayor, Popkov, have jointly issued a moving appeal to all Soviet citizens in the Leningrad region, urging them to defend the city to the last person, and stating that the Red Army is bravely defending the roads leading to the city. The Soviet Navy and Air Force are also continuing to inflict heavy blows on the enemy.

Moscow, Reuters, 21st: The government has announced the formation of new National Guard units to assist the Red Army in strengthening defenses.

Soviet Troops Surrounded West of Minsk Break Through and Rejoin Main Forces

Moscow, United Press, 21st: The troops led by General Boldin, which were surrounded by German forces west of Minsk in July, have broken through after 45 days of resistance and rejoined other Red Army units. General Boldin engaged the main German lines on August 11th, and then, in cooperation with General Konaf's troops from the Soviet side, launched a fierce attack on the enemy positions. After a short battle, General Boldin's troops broke through the enemy lines, killing over a thousand German officers and soldiers, destroying five artillery positions, and 100 motorcycles. General Boldin stated that his troops were surrounded on all sides and split into two by the Germans, but continued to attack the German rear. His troops then attacked the German front, rear, and flanks, eventually approaching the breach created by the German forces (meaning the German forces that had cut off the Soviet troops) and attacking again. He also stated that when his troops returned from Minsk, they repelled 50 German tanks disguised as Soviet tanks, destroying 26 of them. He further stated that on the way to rejoin the Red Army, he was reinforced by other surrounded Soviet troops, crossing swamps and forests, fighting and advancing, and maintaining contact with the main force by radio. He also mentioned that a nurse named Yeshua, disguised as a peasant girl, entered captured villages to gather important German intelligence.

After Two Months of War, German Divisions are Aging and the Air Force Has Failed to Achieve Superiority

A military commentator stated that after 24 hours of heavy fighting on most of the Eastern Front yesterday, the German forces made slight progress between Kingisepp and Novgorod, but there were no startling or decisive results. The Soviet forces continue to fight tenaciously everywhere, and two months of continuous hard fighting seem not to have shaken their morale at all. The German forces are also quite fatigued after two months of fierce fighting. Whether their offensive has weakened as a result is known only to the German High Command and the German soldiers themselves. However, based on human nature, the morale of the average German infantryman, knowing that the enemy is mobile and skilled in combat, must be lower than before. While the effectiveness of the German organizational structure is widely recognized, the increasing distance between the front and the rear, coupled with increasing attrition, will inevitably have a greater impact. There are no new battles in the Smolensk and Kiev regions, and the German claims of gains in Ukraine are the same as those reported two days ago, namely that German forces have attacked the Soviet bridgehead on the north bank of the Dnieper River. Furthermore, although the German side claims to have established complete air superiority, Soviet aircraft, in addition to cooperating with the ground forces, are still able to attack Berlin and the Romanian oil fields, which is noteworthy. At the same time, the Soviet side is conducting a campaign to instruct the people on how to deal with gas and other chemical warfare, as Britain did in the early stages of the war. Many gas defense teams are conducting exercises, and trained speakers and air raid wardens are explaining methods of gas defense and self-protection to residents throughout Moscow. Newspaper editorials and other writings emphasize the possibility that the enemy is prepared to use any vile means to achieve victory, and the necessity for the Soviet people to defend themselves.

Berlin, Havas, 21st: According to official announcements, a unit of German forces on the Ukrainian front, after attacking from Nikolaev, has now occupied Kherson, a city on the lower reaches of the Dnieper River.

Berlin, Havas, 21st: The German High Command has issued a war report stating that German forces on the northern front have occupied the three cities of Novgorod, Kingisepp, and Narva, which form the outer perimeter of Leningrad.

British Reports that the Large Dam on the Dnieper River Has Been Blown Up by Soviet Forces

London, United Press, 21st: The Daily Telegraph reports that, according to消息 from the Swedish capital, Budyonny's division, after communicating with Stalin by telephone, blew up the large dam on the Dnieper River, the site of a major industrial area in central Ukraine.

Berlin, United Press, 21st: The German official news agency stated yesterday that Soviet troops in Ukraine are attempting to遏阻 the German advance, and are launching counterattacks with tanks at several bridge堡垒 west of the Dnieper River. Reliable German sources say that fierce fighting is still ongoing in the far western parts of the Kiev and Korosten areas. The left flank of the German forces on the southern front is still being held up by strong堡垒 positions.

New York, United Press, 21st: Reports from Europe state that a new, intense battle is beginning on the German-Soviet front, stretching from Leningrad to Ukraine, as Hitler seeks to achieve his main objectives before the winter fighting comes to a standstill. According to sources in Berlin, Soviet troops in the Ukrainian region have suffered an "unprecedented disaster of destruction." The Germans expect that Marshal Budyonny's troops, now retreating to the east bank of the Dnieper River and struggling under Nazi artillery fire and air raids, will be destroyed. Meanwhile, Moscow also acknowledges that fierce fighting is developing on the defenses outside Leningrad. According to experts in London, this battle will be the largest bloodbath of the campaign. In other news, sources in the Swedish capital say that Marshal Voroshilov has concentrated 1.5 million troops at key points, and that the German attack has developed on three sides of Leningrad. Foreign observers estimate that although the Soviet troops have suffered significant losses in these two months, the main force remains untouched. They estimate that in another two months, winter will arrive, and the fighting along the 1,800-mile-long front will come to a complete standstill.

### Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Analyzes the Soviet-German War Situation

Germany Cannot Achieve its Goals in Europe by Force, and the Protracted War with the Soviet Union Has Left it in a Dilemma

Tokyo, Havas, 20th: The Asahi Shimbun recently published a report from its Berlin correspondent stating that Germany will ultimately find it difficult to achieve its goals in Europe by relying solely on its own strength. Therefore, "Germany must now redouble its efforts to win the hearts of the people in the occupied areas, as suppressing anti-German movements cannot be solved by military force alone. Hitler is probably aware of this. If he continues to insist on relying solely on force, the hope for peace will never be realized." Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, especially after the declaration of the Anglo-American alliance, the German people's understanding of the current European war has undergone a change. In essence, they had always believed that the current European war could be concluded quickly, but now they have come to realize that the European war is likely to be protracted. However, the German High Command is still seeking to end the war as quickly as possible, and, under the assumption that the Red Army is on the verge of collapse, has outlined various possible developments for the future. One is that after the end of the Soviet-German war, Britain and Germany will make peace. The second is that German forces will land in the British Isles, using the 40 million people of Britain as hostages for peace. In reality, with the war on the Eastern Front in a stalemate, it is difficult for Germany to land in Britain this year. Moreover, the Anglo-American joint declaration has made peace negotiations impossible. Therefore, Germany is in a dilemma. In the future, it must prepare for a long war.

### Belgian Minister of War Broadcasts That Germany Will Be Defeated

London, Reuters, 20th: Belgian Minister of War and Finance, Gutt, broadcast from London last night that Germany has lost 1.5 million soldiers, 800 artillery pieces, and 6,000 aircraft in the first seven weeks of its war against the Soviet Union. Germany will inevitably be defeated in its advance. Not only are British and Soviet bombers heavily bombing Germany, but on a scheduled date, Britain will send soldiers, artillery, and tanks to fight on the European continent. At that time, the Germans, having experienced the terror of being bombed and knowing the hatred of the oppressed people, will lose their confidence in their leaders and in themselves, as in 1918. The great air battle over Britain last September has already caused Germany to retreat, as Hitler cannot win unless he defeats Britain, just as we cannot win until our tanks march in formation down the Berlin boulevards.

### Rumors that Germany Cannot Withstand Bombing and Will Move its Capital South

Several German Ministers Have Now Left Berlin

New York, United Press, 21st: The National Broadcasting Company heard yesterday from the Moscow wireless station that the German government will leave Berlin and move to a southern city because it cannot withstand the intense bombing. The Moscow wireless station stated that several German ministers have already left Berlin, with only a few staff members remaining. The plan for the complete relocation of the German government will be implemented in the autumn, as it is expected that the 機 will launch even more powerful bombing raids at that time.

### German Propaganda Minister Gives a Talk

Madrid, Hentong News Agency, 21st: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels met yesterday with a Berlin-based correspondent from the Spanish "Informaciones" newspaper and gave a talk lasting one hour. He said, in brief: We must know that this war against the Soviet Union is a preliminary condition for the struggle against Britain. The war against the Soviet Union is absolutely necessary. Britain's night raids on German civilian residential areas will one day pay a heavy price. British propaganda often claims that Britain's resources can resist Germany. In fact, Britain can only rely on its island's economic structure and productive power. Materials shipped from the United States or its colonies will encounter German attacks. The activities of German submarines are now having a significant effect. Conversely, Germany's material supplies are all on the mainland, with short and safe routes. Regarding a question about Germany's preparedness, Goebbels replied that Germany has been systematically preparing for economic warfare for eight years. Today, almost all of Europe's resources are in German hands. In fact, Europe's economic structure is now working for the benefit of the Axis powers. Regarding the matter of the United States threatening Iberia and Latin America, Goebbels commented that if President Roosevelt adopts a policy of intervention, it is not for the sake of his friendly friend Churchill, but only for his own interests. Roosevelt is a representative of capitalism. If he were to threaten Iberia and Latin America in peacetime, it would be impossible. Only when these border defenses are weakened can he carry out his threats and seize military, economic, and political bases. If these countries cannot reject his propaganda threats, they will become American "colonies." Regarding the relationship between Germany and Spain, Goebbels replied that Spain has never had a conflict with Germany in its past history, so the Spanish people are among the friendliest people to Germany. The British propaganda policy is to stir up its people's morale, such as not announcing to its citizens the news of the German capture of Smolensk. If Germany were to imitate the British propaganda practices, it could spread alarming rumors, such as spreading the news that the ship carrying Roosevelt and Churchill for their sea talks was torpedoed, which could at least shock the world for a while, but it would inevitably lead to a major mistake later. A powerful country does not need to do this, unlike Britain, which often makes similar propaganda.

### German Control Forces Penetrate Deep into West Africa

London, Reuters, 21st: The Free French Headquarters stated that Dr. Krauss, head of the German mission to French West Africa's Senegal, arrived in Dakar from France on a private plane. The mission consists of hundreds of members. Its activities are no longer limited to Dakar and have expanded to the interior, with Germans being assigned to work alongside French officials in the interior. Therefore, it is generally believed that French officials will soon be replaced by Germans. The colonial officers and administrators are very resentful of this 合. Officials, both military and civilian, in French 　洛哥 are also concerned about the large concentration of troops in Spanish Morocco.

### British Plane Flies to France and Drops Off Artificial Legs

For Use by Legless Pilot, Captain Bader

London, Havas, 20th: Famous British legless pilot, Air Force Captain Bader, previously parachuted out over northern France, breaking his artificial legs and being captured by the Germans. After negotiations by the International Red Cross, Germany has allowed a British aircraft to fly to France today and drop off a pair of artificial legs for Captain Bader to use.

### Iranian Government Takes Military Preparations

And Asks Britain to Return Bahrain Island

A Border Area of Iran, Havas, 21st: The situation in Iran is tense, reaching a peak. Government authorities have taken various precautionary measures in the military sphere. At the same time, the diplomatic pressure exerted by Britain and the Soviet Union is also increasing. To fully understand the situation in Iran, one must first observe its political and military situation. The Iranian army began to modernize in 1928, hiring foreign military advisors, adding new equipment, and providing rigorous training. The national army has only nine帥, of which about ten divisions have been mechanized. There are also five cavalry brigades, an artillery regiment, and an air force with 200 aircraft, mostly old models. These troops are all loyal to the king. Therefore, if foreigners attempt to invade Iranian territory, they will inevitably encounter strong resistance, but due to limited strength, it is feared that this resistance will not be sustained. Politically, Bahrain Island in the Persian Gulf is a British naval base, which is of great importance. The Iranian government has asked Britain to return the island. If this can become a reality, it will greatly benefit the country's prestige. Therefore, the question now is whether Britain considers it important to transport an expeditionary force through Iran to the Soviet Union, and is willing to return Bahrain Island to Iran.

New York, Havas, 21st: Reports from London state that Iran's reply regarding the British and Soviet requests for the Iranian government to expel thousands of German nationals has been unsatisfactory.

Istanbul, Hentong News Agency, 21st: Turkish newspapers report that the German ambassador to Iran has issued an ultimatum to the Iranian government, stating that if Iran succumbs to British diplomatic pressure and expels German nationals, Germany will immediately sever diplomatic relations with Iran. This news has been denied by the Iranian ambassador to Turkey.

### British Foreign Secretary Eden Broadcasts to Turkey

London, Havas, 20th: Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a broadcast speech to the Turkish people today, saying: "Five months ago, I visited your country and had sincere and frank talks with your President Inonu. Since then, there have been many severe changes internationally, but one thing remains certain: your country has an unshakable determination to defend its independence and resist aggression. Fortunately, your country has this determination and courage, which enables it to gain an important position in the Middle East. This was true in the past, it is true now, and it will be true in the future if you maintain this spirit. I wish the friendly country prosperity."

### Rumors that Germany and France Will Discuss Peace Terms

London, Reuters, 21st: The Independent French News Agency传维希官塲 that Vichy and Germany are discussing peace terms, and that Vichy will allow Germany to use French and French African naval and military bases under this peace agreement. Germany hopes to conclude an agreement with Vichy, or at least a preliminary agreement, in the shortest possible time. In return for borrowing the bases, Germany will withdraw some of its troops stationed in France, and those remaining will be considered allies, as with the troops stationed in Italy, rather than being treated as an occupied area. After the war, British territories in Africa, such as Nigeria and the Gold Coast, could be ceded to France and jointly developed by Germany and France. Vichy would cede the French provinces of Alsace and Finland to Germany, but France could receive some areas in northern Belgium. France would not have to cede land to Italy and could retain Tunis, while Italy would take Egypt as compensation for relinquishing Tunis. These negotiations are currently underway.

### The Value of the French Currency Increases and the Exchange Rate Returns to Normal, but Prices Remain High and Do Not Fall

Merchants are Inherently Greedy and Cannot Be Restrained

Citizens are Eager for the Authorities to Implement Controls

According to responsible sources in this city, when the exchange rate recently fell, many Chinese shop owners and those who hoarded goods to profit from the situation, being inherently greedy, drastically raised various prices, making them simply impossible to束. An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Investigation Office also admitted that although the value of the French currency has risen in recent days, various prices have not decreased slightly as a result.

Price Investigation Ended Long Ago

When the reporter asked about the Chinese newspapers' recent criticism of the SMC for the rising price of items such as coal briquettes, the official replied that those making such criticisms have failed to consider factors such as wage increases that contribute to the rising cost of living. The Price Investigation Office is now only engaged in compiling a weekly comparative table of basic prices, and the work of investigating general prices has ended some time ago. The SMC is no longer investigating the wholesale prices of goods or the daily fluctuations in prices.

Comparative Figures Obtained Through Inquiry

When the reporter asked how the SMC determines the figures in the weekly price comparison table, the official explained that general prices are based on market prices. If an item cannot be purchased on the market, then its price is inquired from general stores in the International Settlement. "General stores" refer to medium-sized stores, not large firms or small shops, but the selling prices reported by various stores are always different.

Chinese Side Expresses Disappointment

Chinese sources here have expressed disappointment that the SMC has stopped investigating general prices during this "emergency period," as the SMC's investigation of prices would give merchants the impression that their selling prices are subject to scrutiny by the authorities. This is also one of the reasons for the rising cost of living.

Exchange Rate Returns to Normal, but Prices Do Not Fall

When the exchange rate of the French currency fell, all prices increased. Now that the exchange rate has returned to normal, and is the same as before the fall, the prices have not decreased slightly. The excuse is nothing more than that they cannot replenish their stock at the old price. The reporter also asked the SMC Price Investigation Office about implementing price controls here. According to reports, the SMC believes that implementing this measure would require huge expenditures to hire many personnel to collect the necessary facts and figures in order to be effective. The exorbitant prices involve many factors such as shipping and exchange rates, which the SMC cannot control in a short period.

Increasing the Price of Foreign Rice is Truly Unwise

Rumors that many Chinese stores are selling bread that is short in weight are inconsistent with the SMC's findings. Bread is an important food, and the SMC is paying close attention to it. Chinese sources here have also criticized the SMC's increase in the price of foreign rice, saying that this action is truly unwise and has proven to stimulate shop owners to raise prices.

### Tofu Prices to Rise Starting Tomorrow

The Tofu Association met and discussed the matter the day before yesterday, and decided to raise prices again starting on the 23rd of this month, with the minimum retail price being one 角. This will add to the burden on the lives of ordinary people, which is by no means insignificant. The new price list set by the industry lists the price per board as five 元. The retail price of tender tofu will be at least one 角 (currently only five 分), and the retail price of old tofu will be at least two 角 (currently only one 角). The price increases for tofu products listed in the new price list are also significant. Tofu skin will be four 角 per sheet, and fragrant tofu will be one 角 per piece. The price increases are about double. In the past, the industry would typically close for one day before a price increase to show its determination. This year, the industry association, fearing trouble, has persuaded them not to do so.

### Public Granary Siam Rice – Sale Begins Tomorrow

46 Retailers Distributing, Price at 116 Yuan

Since the establishment of the Shanghai Food Rice Public Granary Management Committee, a batch of Rangoon rice was processed in early July and sold to the Public Works Department (工部局) at a fair price. It was then distributed to various rice shops for retail sale at a price of 116 yuan per stone. Subsequently, it was decided to purchase another batch from Thailand, Burma, and other places to regulate the food supply for the citizens of Shanghai. Now, a batch of Siam No. 2 rice, totaling 400 tons, has been shipped to Shanghai. The committee believes that the Siam No. 2 rice is different in quality from the Rangoon rice of the Public Works Department’s fair-priced rice, and the quantity is only 400 tons. Therefore, it was decided not to sell it to the Public Works Department as before. Instead, it was decided to entrust 46 members of the Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association to sell it at fair prices in their stores, totaling 3,734 bags. In addition, the committee also has 58,350 bags of Rangoon rice, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of September.

### Axis Powers Far East Nationals Withdraw to Shanghai in Stages

480 German, Italian, and Japanese Nationals Arrive Today from Manila by Ship

The French postal ship Général Joffre, which came to Shanghai via Saigon and Little Luzon, was originally scheduled to arrive on the 16th of this month, but was later changed to the 19th. Due to bad weather and fog at sea, the voyage was delayed. It was reported yesterday that it would be delayed until yesterday. It is now known that the postal ship did not arrive yesterday. According to sources at the company, it is expected to arrive this morning. It will not stay in Shanghai for long and will return to Vietnam soon.

Nationals of the Three Countries Withdraw from the Philippines to Shanghai

The English-language "China Press" reports that 480 German, Italian, and Japanese nationals withdrawing from Manila have departed on the French postal ship Général Joffre and are expected to arrive here at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 22nd). The Général Joffre came from Saigon and Manila to Shanghai. French postal company personnel remained silent on the matter. However, it is learned that most of the German and Italian nationals on board the Général Joffre will disembark in Shanghai, while the 375 Japanese nationals will proceed to Japan via Shanghai.

Général Joffre Was Searched

The Général Joffre also carries approximately 5,000 bags of tribute rice to Shanghai and will be moored at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Passengers will disembark at the Customs Wharf. According to reports, when the Général Joffre docked in Manila, the U.S. High Commissioner's Office in the Philippines sent personnel to board the ship and search passengers' luggage for frozen securities.

Future Movements of the Japanese Nitta Maru

Personnel at the Japan Mail Steamship Co. here recently stated that they have not received any news regarding the Nitta Maru, which is currently docked in Japan, so they do not know whether the ship will resume its voyages to Shanghai. The Nitta Maru had previously called at Shanghai several weeks ago and carried away a large number of Japanese nationals. Due to the political situation, the ship has suspended its voyages to the United States.

U.S. Evacuation Ship Prepares to Sail to Japan

According to sources in the shipping industry, a postal ship from the U.S. President Lines is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the end of this month. It is reported that the U.S. authorities are currently engaged in serious negotiations with the Japanese regarding the evacuation of Japanese nationals residing in the United States. Once the ship arrives in Shanghai, if the negotiations are successful, it will sail to Japan to prepare for the evacuation of U.S. nationals residing in Japan. It is also learned that the President Lines office in Shanghai will refuse to sell first-class tickets for the Shanghai-Hong Kong route on this ship, as it is intended to be reserved for U.S. nationals traveling to Japan. As for the exact date of the ship's arrival in Shanghai, the company does not wish to disclose it for security reasons.

British Nationals in Japan Evacuate When Opportunity Arises

Walter Duranty, the Tokyo correspondent of the "North China Daily News", reported on the 20th that an official at the British Embassy here told reporters tonight that the British authorities are not currently taking any planned action to evacuate the remaining British nationals in Japan, nor have they planned this matter with the Japanese authorities. However, many British nationals wish to leave Japan when the opportunity arises. Although there are currently no British ships in Japanese ports, and no British ships are expected to arrive in Japan in the near future, British nationals can take Japanese ships to Shanghai and then travel to other places, apparently without any obstacles. However, the recent freezing order will naturally cause inconvenience, and the Japanese side has now implemented stricter regulations on the departure of foreign nationals from Japan.

Foreign Nationals in the Northeast Begin to Evacuate

British and American nationals residing in various parts of the Northeast have been subjected to surveillance and obstruction by the Japanese authorities since the British and American governments froze funds. One hundred British and American nationals from Harbin have already begun their evacuation and are expected to arrive in Tanggu by train today. With the exception of a few who will transfer to trains to Tianjin and Beijing, the rest will await ships to Shanghai. This group of British and American nationals includes merchants, missionaries, and women and children, and they are expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month.

### New U.S. Commercial Counselor Discusses Future Shanghai-U.S. Trade

Not Restricted by Freezing Order, Legitimate Trade Can Continue as Usual

The English-language "Finance and Commerce" reported that Groves, the new U.S. Commercial Counselor who arrived in Shanghai last week, is succeeding Arnold in his vacancy. Mr. Groves is visiting Shanghai for the first time. A special representative of this newspaper went to call on him and was received by Mr. Groves. According to Mr. Groves, "Trade between the United States and Shanghai is unlikely to be affected for a long period of time. The amount of U.S. imports is also unlikely to be reduced by the regulations on trade and exchange announced in Washington on July 26." Mr. Groves then discussed the recent freezing order and stated his opinion that the U.S. authorities should have some regulations to allow trade between the United States and Shanghai, China, and other foreign countries to continue within a reasonable scope. He said that the U.S. must pay attention to the control of foreign trade and that U.S. exports to Shanghai must be for normal purposes. He believes that under strict control, U.S. supplies may not be abused with foreign exchange facilities. U.S. commercial banks must handle the business in order to continue legitimate imports. He continued, "As far as the authorities in Washington are concerned, applications for exports to Shanghai and other Far East ports must be obtained from the Export Control Administrator, General Maxwel. It is, of course, possible that the Ministry of Finance may refuse to provide financial facilities even if the Administration has issued export certificates. But in general, unless there is a major change in the Pacific situation, trade between the United States and Shanghai will not be severely affected." However, Mr. Groves' opinion is, of course, only in terms of financial aspects and does not include the lack of transportation ships. Therefore, Mr. Groves admitted that if the transportation problem continues to change, it is difficult to predict how much the quantity of U.S. exports to Shanghai will be in the coming months. When Mr. Groves discussed the general principles of trade, he said that normal trade relations have long ceased to exist since World War I in 1918. Every country has erected trade barriers to protect its own economy and resist the economy of its neighbors, which has greatly affected international trade. He said, "When peace comes again, I firmly believe that trade will no longer have this kind of shackle, goods will have more freedom of movement, and prosperity will come with peace."

### Four Banks' Office Drafts Measures for Applying for Foreign Exchange

Import Bans Halt Exchange Settlements; Chief Customs Commissioner Releases Detailed List

A reporter from New Voice News learned yesterday from the Four Banks that the regulations on the prohibition of foreign exchange applications for prohibited import goods and the measures for applying for foreign exchange for necessities have been drafted by the Joint Office of the Four Banks and will be announced and implemented soon. All Chinese commercial banks licensed to deal in foreign exchange may apply to the Bank of China (中國銀行) and Bank of Communications (交通銀行) on behalf of merchants importing goods.

Foreign Exchange Applications Must Be Guaranteed

The measures for applying for foreign exchange for necessities have been drafted by the Four Banks. According to a reporter from New Voice News, applicants must have a valid guarantee and fill out an application form. The application form should state: (1) applicant, (2) purpose, tariff number, name of goods, country of origin, quantity or weight, value, port of departure and date, import location and transport area, (3) foreign exchange currency, amount, date required, exchange location, (4) documents, (5) remarks, applicant's signature, seal, date and place. After review and approval, the Bank of China or Bank of Communications will provide the exchange at the Shanghai exchange rate stipulated by the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, namely £3 1/875 and $5.375. However, for those importing into the free zone, applications should be made to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee and provided at the statutory exchange rate after approval, namely £1 2 1/2 pence and $30. However, applicants must pay the balancing fee for the difference between the statutory exchange rate and the commercial exchange rate. The commercial exchange rate is quoted by the Bank of China and Bank of Communications at £4 1/2 pence and $7.50.

Detailed List of Prohibited Items

While the supply of foreign exchange is strictly limited to the import of necessities, the settlement and sale of foreign exchange for prohibited import goods are completely suspended. Detailed measures have been drafted by the authorities of the Four Banks. As for the list of prohibited import goods, there are many rumors from the outside world. A reporter from New Voice News learned yesterday from the Office of the Chief Customs Commissioner that the prohibited import goods include luxury goods, consumables, and substitutes, totaling twelve categories, eighteen groups, and two hundred and thirty-four items. The detailed list is as follows: (To be continued)

It is reported that the train was a mixed passenger and freight train. After the accident, the twenty-eight injured were sent to Jiaxing Hospital for treatment, with varying degrees of injury. The Japanese army and railway authorities immediately conducted an investigation, and train services were suspended until noon yesterday (the 20th) when repairs were completed and traffic resumed.

### Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund Promotes Store Employee Reading Movement

Store Clerks and Apprentices Can Apply; Application Forms Being Printed, Registration to Begin Within Days

All procedures for the current session of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund will be completed after all scholarships for major universities and specialized schools are distributed within days. According to the resolution of the Readers' Scholarship Fund Committee, the staff of this newspaper will immediately organize the application for scholarships for industrial and commercial employees, in order to fulfill the instructions of those who have enthusiastically donated funds, as well as the sincere requests from industrial and commercial employees. Yesterday, people from all walks of life continued to donate money to the scholarship fund. However, this newspaper has decided to temporarily suspend the acceptance of donations and has politely explained that it will be handled again at a fixed time. In addition, it has also been decided to distribute the scholarships for major universities and specialized schools earlier, starting on the 24th. The details are recorded as follows:

Subsidies for Part-time Study

The Scholarship Fund Committee has received: (1) repeated letters from responsible persons of various manufacturers and firms to this newspaper requesting the committee to provide assistance to industrial and commercial employees for part-time study; (2) suggestions from scholarship donors to establish scholarships for industrial and commercial employees in addition to scholarships for students in major universities, middle schools, and primary schools; (3) letters from store clerks and apprentices expressing the pain of losing the opportunity to study and requesting assistance to help them with part-time study. After serious discussion, it was agreed that the suggestions of the donors and the desire of industrial and commercial employees to learn are commendable and should be given appropriate assistance. It was decided to allocate 5,000 yuan to handle this matter. The resolution was published in this newspaper on the 20th. Yesterday, many industrial and commercial employees sent letters inquiring about the measures, which shows their great concern. Application forms are currently being printed. Any industrial and commercial employee who intends to apply for a scholarship must first obtain a letter of recommendation or certificate from the manager of the service manufacturer or firm for review. Those who do not have this certificate or letter of recommendation will not be approved. It is hoped that all applicants will pay special attention to this point. If people from all walks of life have any opinions, please teach us so that we can achieve perfection.

List of Approved Free Places to Be Announced

The list of approved scholarship recipients for major universities and middle schools will be fully published today. In addition, the various applicants who the committee believes can be assisted but need to be reviewed and supplement documents, as well as the free students from the four newly built schools, the Second New School, Yuhua, Zhengzhong Girls' High School, and Jingzhi Girls' High School, will be reviewed and announced on the 24th. Please pay attention.

Scholarships to Be Issued One Day Earlier

Many students applying for scholarships have sent letters requesting early issuance due to the imminent deadline for paying tuition fees. The staff of this newspaper are currently expediting the procedures and have decided to issue the scholarships earlier, starting at 9:30 a.m. on the 24th (Sunday). However, the schools have long stipulated that banks and other institutions collect tuition fees on behalf of the schools. Some applicants may not be able to pay on time due to the short time. It is requested that the school authorities appreciate that these students are poor and studying hard and have been fortunate enough to receive sympathy from the community to continue their studies. Please make an exception and allow them to pay their tuition at the school. Several school authorities have already expressed their willingness to do so, and it is believed that other school authorities will also be able to understand.

Enthusiastic Donations Have Not Slackened

Regarding the continued intention of people from all walks of life, which is admirable, this newspaper stated in yesterday's newspaper that the acceptance of donations would be closed on the 20th in order to streamline procedures. However, this morning, enthusiastic scholarship supporters brought more than 800 yuan and asked to be included. This newspaper politely explained this, and they understood. The staff felt very sorry for the hard work. Later, at dusk, another enthusiastic reader who donated 200 yuan repeatedly stated their approval of the staff's service and firmly refused to take back the money they intended to donate. The staff reluctantly accepted it with shame and gratitude and will publish it in this newspaper at the end of the month together with the donations from the monthly donors to show our credibility. Therefore, the staff decided to express their gratitude to all sectors of society for their enthusiastic donations, on the one hand, to show their concern for the students, and, on the other hand, to streamline the scholarship procedures of this newspaper. All those who continue to donate after the deadline of this period will be announced monthly at the end of the month, in addition to the official receipt issued by this newspaper at the time. Please understand.

### Approved List

The list of approved places for the major universities and middle schools group by the Scholarship Fund Committee of this newspaper has been fully published today. Those who have not taken the examination or do not know which school they have been admitted to, as well as other applicants who have the same situation, are requested to notify us by letter immediately and must attach proof. Payment is scheduled to begin on the 24th.

### Gonghexiang Wharf Workers' Arrest Conflict

Strike Causes Four Workers Injured, One Dead; Two Western Police Officers on Scene Also Slightly Injured

Over two hundred temporary workers at the Gonghexiang Wharf on Hongkou East Broadway Road (虹口東百老匯路), managed by Jardine Matheson, elected representatives to request higher wages and allowances from management due to the rising cost of living and the difficulty of making ends meet. The request was denied, and the workers went on strike on the day.

At around 3 p.m. yesterday, the management sent representatives to negotiate with the workers' representatives. The management had previously telephoned the police station requesting police to maintain order. However, all the temporary workers expressed strong dissatisfaction. The negotiations were again unsuccessful, resulting in a conflict between all the workers and the management. Some workers even pulled out iron bars and bricks and threw them at the management representatives, and the situation was very serious for a time. The police officers on the scene tried their best to suppress the violence and maintain order, but to no avail. The police officers then fired several shots, wounding five workers. One of them was shot in a vital area and died on the spot. Two Western police officers were also injured, one named Open, the other Klabbe. Afterwards, the police station sent a large number of police officers to investigate. The four injured workers were sent to Shanghai East Sanatorium for treatment, and the body of the dead worker was sent to the coroner's office for examination. The two Western police officers were sent to the police hospital for treatment.

### Pacific Hurricane to Strike Shanghai Again

If Wind Direction Does Not Change, Shanghai Will Be Affected

Since the heavy rain the day before yesterday, the weather in Shanghai has turned cooler, and the sky has been cloudy and sunny. Yesterday, we learned from the Xujiahui Observatory that a new hurricane has formed near the Ryukyu Islands and is moving rapidly north and north-northwest. As of 2 p.m. yesterday, the center of the hurricane had reached 126.30 degrees east longitude and 27 degrees north latitude. If the hurricane continues on this course, Shanghai will feel its threat on the morning of. However, the hurricane is weaker than the previous one. The Jianghai Customs (江海關) and others are closely monitoring it. However, Shanghai seemed to have felt the effects of the hurricane's outer bands yesterday. A bungalow opposite Hollywood Road (愚國路) collapsed after being invaded by rain and blown by the wind, injuring Mao Zhao (44 years old), Mao Jinbao (11 years old), and Mao Faqing (2 years old), a mother and her two children who lived in the house. They were taken to the Tongren Second Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The Shanghai Maritime Customs hoisted a red and black light on the rooftop clock tower at 8:15 p.m. yesterday to warn ships in the Huangpu River to take precautions against hurricane strikes. It is reported that the hurricane has entered the Taiwan Strait. It is expected that the hurricane's distance from Shanghai will be such that the city may be hit this afternoon. However, according to the aforementioned wind direction, the city can still avoid being hit. However, the wind direction changes at any time, and it is difficult to predict whether the city will be hit by the hurricane.

### Qunxian Villa Tenants Suffer Oppression from Landlords

All tenants of Qunxian Villa (羣賢別墅) on Avenue du Père Huc (金神父路) are on indefinite leases and have been getting along for many years. The rent has been increased three times. Last spring, the landlord had a whimsical idea and suddenly entrusted the lease to MacDillan & Co. Within a few days, they sent a letter proposing another rent increase. The tenants, in order to make the best of a bad situation, reluctantly increased the rent by 20%, and they would take care of the water bill themselves. It was stipulated in writing that the rent would not be increased again within a year and a half. Unexpectedly, before the ink was dry, the company broke its promise this spring and sent a letter proposing another 50% rent increase and advertised the villas for sale by building. All the tenants believe that finding a house is extremely difficult and also published a notice to the purchasers, stating that the premises are not vacant and that strong-arm tactics should not be used to take it back for personal use, and that attention should be paid to the strict provisions of Article 425 of the Civil Code. Recently, a group of people calling themselves new owners have disregarded social realities and have launched a group lawsuit. The first to suffer was the tenant at No. 27 of this lane, who was ordered to move out. Once this precedent is set, landlords who own houses will follow suit, and the city's 5 million residents will inevitably be in danger. In addition to petitioning the judicial administration authorities for relief, the association appeals to enlightened people from all walks of life for effective assistance.

### 葆大參號　清晨送到炸彈

Outwardly wrapped as a "Liangyou Pictorial" and instructed to be given to the manager, followed by a telephone call inquiring, startling the shop assistants.

At the Baoda Ginseng Shop, number 503 on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, west of the Great World, at 7:15 yesterday morning, just after opening for business, a man dressed in short clothes resembling a worker arrived with a package wrapped in Liangyou Pictorial paper. He handed it to Xia Yizuo, the old clerk, instructing him to give it to the manager, Ling Shoupeng, a native of Ningbo. He then turned and left. Xia placed the package on the counter, paying it no mind. Shortly after, a student, Yang Xiaoxian, saw the package on the counter and, recognizing it as the Liangyou Pictorial, was overjoyed and prepared to open it to read. Suddenly, the telephone rang. Another employee, Tong Ligeng, a native of Ningbo, answered. The caller did not identify himself or his location, only saying that he had sent a Liangyou Pictorial to Mr. Ling and asking if it had been received. Tong replied that Mr. Ling had not yet arrived but would be there in about an hour. Before Tong could hang up, another employee, Chen Fengyang, discovered that the package contained a small hand grenade. At this point, all the employees in the shop, big and small, were terrified and rushed away from the danger, completely panicked. Fortunately, although the bomb had been opened and moved, it did not explode. They immediately telephoned the Avenue Joffre police station, which in turn reported to the Louzawei General Police Station. Central and foreign detectives were dispatched to investigate. The bomb was taken back to the police station for disposal, and the manager was summoned for questioning to determine if he had received any threatening letters or if there had been any other incidents. The police also sent detectives to find the person who delivered the bomb, vowing to bring them to justice.

### 天氣報告

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that in Shandong Province, the weather would change from clear to cloudy with strong northeasterly winds and occasional showers. Here, the sky would be overcast with occasional showers and a shift to strong northeasterly winds. In the East China Sea, there would be cyclones and sudden rainstorms with considerable force due to a strong hurricane moving north-northwest. At 2:00 PM, the hurricane's center was located at 27 degrees north latitude, 126.30 degrees east longitude, within 60 miles. The wind direction was north-northwest with strong force. Also, within the 24 hours prior to 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the city was 82.8 degrees and the lowest was 75.2 degrees.

Finance: Importers Return to the Black Market After Receiving Little from Approved Exchange Requests

美匯昨又緊至四元六二五
The U.S. Dollar Tightens Again to $4.625 Yesterday

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's posted rates. U.S. dollars on small counters remained at $5.3125. Black market U.S. dollars were effectively priceless. The U.S. dollar trended towards tightening again, with Chinese speculators slightly increasing their long positions, while British and Japanese firms showed considerable appetite. The morning price tightened from $4.875 to $4.75. In the afternoon, the British-American Tobacco Company and cotton merchants had substantial settlement needs. It was also rumored that British and American firms had a meeting and, given the small amount of approved exchange requests, were considering maintaining the black market. American firms and other banks repeatedly raised prices for supply. Therefore, amidst the chaos, the price of British gold broke the previous tight price of 2 pounds, 8 shillings, 4 and 3/8 pence from the 11th of this month, reaching 2 pounds, 8 shillings, 1 and 1/8 pence. The U.S. dollar also approached the $4.75 mark from that day, reaching a new tight price of $4.625. Both currencies tightened considerably, and trading became brisk.

進口商結款益繁
Importers' Settlement Needs Increase

Since the recent slight decrease in the telegraphic transfer of silver from London, the remaining exchanges and British and American silver remained unchanged. Various foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against Shanghai were up slightly by 2.4 cents, the rest were flat. The central bank's posted rates were all flat. The morning opening bank selling prices on the domestic market were: large spot central gold, 2 pounds, 9 shillings, 6 and 7/8 pence; U.S. dollars, $4.84375. Chinese speculators continued to sell U.S. dollars for August delivery at $4.875. HSBC's posted rates remained flat. After deducting the silver equalization tax of 24.25%, British and Japanese firms successively absorbed August dollars at $4.875 and $4.84375. The market trended towards tightening, especially at midday. Foreign firms aggressively bought August dollars at $4.8125, causing the afternoon closing price for U.S. dollars to be only $4.78125. Some were settled at only $4.75. British gold was 2 pounds, 9 shillings, 3 and 7/8 pence, still short of a formal market price. In the afternoon, importers' needs for settling payments for tobacco and fireworks increased, and they further bought August dollars at $4.75 and $4.6875. The pace of tightening was even sharper. The willingness of American and other foreign banks to supply was even weaker. Therefore, at the 3:30 PM closing, the spot U.S. dollar price for September settlement was $4.625 (some were settled at only $4.59375), and British gold followed, tightening to 2 pounds, 8 shillings, 1 and 1/8 pence. Compared to the previous day's noon closing, the U.S. dollar tightened by 2.1875, and British gold tightened by 1.5625.

### 現金一漲三百元

Cash Spikes by $300

Yesterday, the black market for cash gold saw an initial surge followed by a decline, then a renewed increase. After breaking the $6,800 mark, it saw renewed selling. Although the HSBC small counter U.S. dollar rate remained at $5.3125, it was reported that legitimate commercial settlements from Monday had not yet been received. Importers aggressively sought dollars on the black market, leading to a sharp tightening of foreign exchange. The weary sentiment among various parties inevitably shifted to firmness. Short covering was more urgent than selling. Hong Kong and Shanghai gangs aggressively bought, causing the daily price to rise from $6,750 in the morning to $6,875 on the board in the afternoon, eventually reversing and closing up $28. Total trading volume was 150,000 taels. The forward spread (August rolling into September) saw buyers pay sellers from $90 to as high as $120. The rising trend in cash intensified, reaching unprecedented peaks. In the morning, Tong Kangyong sold 130 taels to Xiang Xingyong at $9,100. Shi He and Shun Yuan each sold 20 taels to De Cheng at $9,210. Shun Yuan then sold 50 taels to the silversmiths' guild at $9,250, and another 60 taels to Tian Yuan at $9,260. Xiang Xingyong sold 10 taels to De Da at $9,300. Shun Yuan sold 10 taels to Cheng Ji at $9,220. In the afternoon, Shun Yuan sold 50 taels to Xiang He at $9,250. Tian Yuan sold 140 taels to Gong He, Da Cheng Yong, Xin Yuan, and De Cheng at $9,260. Yi Da and Tong Kangyong each sold 10 taels to He Sheng at $9,300. This was a huge surge of $300 from the previous day's price. Jewelry gold also rose by $20 to a new high of $990.

期貨暫做了結交易
Futures Trading Temporarily Suspended for Closing Transactions

Since this morning, each bar (10 taels) has been subject to the exchange's recommendation, following yesterday afternoon's meeting, to temporarily suspend closing transactions. Given the HSBC small counter U.S. dollar rate of $5.3125, it was feared that it would not be changed, and the market sentiment inevitably softened. Supply was less than demand, causing the 9:05 AM opening price to be $6,750, $82 lower than the previous day's closing price. Short sellers took advantage of the low price to cover their positions. Tian Yuan and Chi Da aggressively bought, and Jin Hao and Cheng Ji further increased their buying. The price then rose by $40 to $6,790. Yi Da and Shen Ji sold, causing a retreat to $6,770. Later, due to the tightening of the black market U.S. dollar, the selling trend weakened, and Yi Yuan absorbed supply, raising the price to $6,780. The noon closing price was $6,776, and after the closing, it was $6,780. In the afternoon, sentiment was quite good. The 2:00 PM opening price immediately rose to the $6,800 level. It then declined slightly to $6,785. Due to the sharp tightening of the black market foreign exchange, He Sheng, Cheng Ji, De Cheng, Yi Da, and others aggressively absorbed supply, causing a rise of $90, reaching $6,875, where Xiang Xing Yong and retail investors sold. The price retreated to $6,845. Da Feng and Yi Da aggressively bought, and at the 3:30 PM closing, the price was $6,860, $28 higher than the previous day's noon closing price. Based on the black market September U.S. dollar settlement price of $4.625, the price was $7,529, an increase of $169. If calculated based on the HSBC small counter U.S. dollar rate of $5.3125, the price was $6,555, an increase of $305. There was a difference of $125 on the day. After the closing, the price was $6,870. The market selling price of the cash gold firm's own brand gold must be $9,300, with a $200 reduction for buying back. The current marked price is neither priced nor marketable.

Jewelry Gold Quoted at $950

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang rose by $10 at 10:30 AM, and again by $10 at 11:30 AM, reaching $950 (with a $40 reduction for buying back), a total increase of $20.

### 外幣一致升騰

Foreign Currencies Rise Across the Board

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw continued soaring prices in the cash market. British and American gold pounds also continued to rise by $10. There was strong demand for British gold drafts, and market prices surged by $3. U.S. dollar drafts opened at $1,930.

In addition, currencies such as Singapore, Annam, Robbie, and Canadian drafts also trended upward.

### 油市　油儈毫不放鬆　狂抬油價

Oil Market: Oil Merchants Refuse to Relent, Frantically Raising Oil Prices

Yesterday, speculative buying of cooking oil suddenly surged again. The general rice weevils and oil merchants colluded, acting recklessly, causing the prices of rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil to be raised, rising step by step, increasing by as much as $10. Black market prices for raw soybean oil were also strong. The overall market selling price of Qing oil from Da You Factory was $199 to $204 for over 1,000 dans. Also, 700 dans of rapeseed oil were priced at $208 to $210. Rapeseed oil from the Rihua Factory was priced at $200 to $208.50 for 1,500 barrels. Rapeseed oil from the Yoshida Factory was priced at $198 to $100 for 150 barrels. Rapeseed oil from the Lide Factory was priced at $92 to $101.50 for 100 barrels. Rapeseed oil from the Taishan Factory was priced at $194 to $100 for 100 barrels.

In addition, 560 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Hong Kong today.

Grain: Small-Sized Imported Rice Falls Below the Government Selling Price

只須外匯有供給更無問題
No Problems as Long as Foreign Exchange is Supplied

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice initially declined, then stabilized, and market prices saw another drop of $2-3. This was because there was a sufficient inventory of foreign rice, and shipments were continuously arriving at the port. The market had already shown a downward trend. Recently, with reliance on the supply of foreign exchange, ample vessels, and lower freight rates, costs could be reduced. Also, telegrams from the producing areas indicated that local market prices were declining. Therefore, at present, orders could be placed in large quantities as long as foreign exchange was available for settlement. As a result, sentiment weakened further. In the early market, in addition to Heyi soliciting sales, Shen Ji also dumped 8-900 tons of small-sized "Ganwu" rice arriving in five days at a price of only $148-9. The spot market price for the original bagged small-sized imported rice immediately fell to $146, and $139.50 for 20% rice, but there was a lack of large buyers. Domestic rice also trended downward. Small-sized rice from the Xiaowen market fell to $120, lower than the fair selling price. Other types of rice all showed a downward trend. However, after the price fell slightly, it was absorbed by various hoarders who took advantage of the small decline. Also, rumors spread that foreign exchange applications were difficult, so the afternoon market saw a slight rebound. The total transaction volume for the day was reportedly 10,000 bags.

Regarding the previously reported shipment of 7,000 bags of foreign rice from Shanghai to Tianjin on the Taikoo Company's "Ganzhou" vessel, it is now learned that the vessel will depart today, carrying only 5,000 bags of foreign rice to Qingdao, not Tianjin. However, the original vessel still has a large quantity of foreign rice from Hong Kong bound for Yantai and Tianjin. The entire vessel is filled with foreign rice and no miscellaneous goods. (Zu)

Due to the heavy rains in the past two days, which turned the roads into flooded areas, the majority of sources for thick and thin japonica domestic rice were obstructed, and arrivals were scarce. The existing market inventory had also been depleted after continuous selling. Therefore, holders of the remaining inventory considered it a rare commodity and were unwilling to sell it rashly. Whenever inquiries were made, prices were repeatedly raised, and general customers, eager to meet their needs, had no choice but to yield. Therefore, the prices of both thick and thin japonica rice rose by $2-3. Early rice from Kai Nan Port was $153-4, then $150. Specially selected japonica rice in original bags from Wuxi was $155, with the overall market price at $150 and substandard goods at $145-6. New japonica rice from Pudong also rose in response to this environment, opening at $158-9.

With the arrival of autumn, general transporters of glutinous rice have begun to receive shipments from the producing areas they had ordered in advance. These shipments have gradually arrived at the port and are now available in the market, boosting market activity. At the same time, the sales volume is not as sluggish as in the past, with both retail sales to food vendors and wholesale transactions with restaurants and wine merchants being more active. Therefore, the overall market situation remains balanced in terms of supply and demand, and prices have not seen significant gains or losses. Hong Kong white glutinous rice continues to open at $130, settling at $125. Glutinous rice ranges from $117 to $114. Domestic glutinous rice is $133-4.

Flour Market Gradually Softens

新囤觀望…舊多求脫
New Stockpiles Watch… Old Stockpiles Seek to Exit

Yesterday's spot market for imported flour saw a gradual softening. According to actual sales in this district, the amount is sufficient for daily use because the factory's capacity is not enough, which is not bad, and there is also some turnover for re-export, so the market is not too loose. However, with the availability of foreign exchange for importing foreign flour and rumors of new transactions being finalized, sentiment inevitably weakened amid continuous arrivals. New stockpiles watched, and old stockpiles sought to exit, causing market prices to gradually soften. Jinlong flour from the Puxi warehouse was priced at $33.15 to $33, Cannonball flour at $34.45 to $34.05, Banana flour at $33.70, and Five Swallow flour at $33.90, all $0.02-0.03 lower than before. The total transaction volume was less than 20,000 bags.

Trading remained sluggish. Due to the limited arrivals in the vicinity, only Japanese factories made slight purchases, while Chinese factories found it difficult to buy. The factories' purchase prices remained unchanged, and market trading remained at a standstill.

Yarn and Cotton: Some Say Stockpiling Yarn is Better Than Storing Cotton; Forward Yarn Still Drives Activity

The yarn market trended towards a cyclical path. However, sentiment towards factory orders from Double Horse Mill was largely bearish, resulting in a decline in recent transactions and a lack of strong elasticity in the market. Although the volume of spot yarn transactions was not as high as before, market prices remained relatively stable. 32-count and 42-count yarn remained consistently firm, and 20-count miscellaneous brand yarn also showed an upward trend. Only factory orders were mediocre. However, some were still being absorbed, as the cost of raw materials had increased the factory's costs. There was discussion in the market that stockpiling yarn was better than storing cotton. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was $1,683, the low price was $1,658, and the closing price was $1,672. The market was closed in the afternoon. It was heard that prices for yarn and cloth on the exchange were rising across the board, which boosted sentiment. It was unknown if there were other "bullish drivers." Some said that the marked price had risen seven times again. In addition, the continuous shipments of yarn to Hong Kong continued. Today, there were 1,630 pieces of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong.

The opening price of Double Horse yarn in the morning showed a softening trend, as most expected a pullback, so there was a lack of enthusiasm among buyers, and transactions were not as active as in the past. The initial price was $1,660, which soon fell to $1,658. Later, profit-takers bought back and new buyers emerged, and at the same time, the second session on the exchange rebounded, so the situation followed and rose, gradually rising to $1,683. However, the market predicted that it would be difficult to break the $1,700 mark for the time being. As prices improved slightly, short selling returned. At the same time, actual transactions were sluggish, and the price softened again to a closing price of $1,672, down $3 from the previous day. However, selling pressure in the market was not strong. The transaction volume for half a day was 6,158 bales.

The market trend for Double Horse gold forward yarn was firm and strong, rising again. The morning opening started with higher U.S. cotton prices, while factory orders showed a downward trend. However, forward yarn, due to the large drop from yesterday, suddenly attracted the interest of many parties. The closure of gold market trading also enhanced the potential of many buyers. September futures opened at $1,575, up $4.50. Although it once fell to $1,568, it quickly rebounded. Later, October futures opened at $1,590, up $7.50. November futures opened at $1,606. After the opening, trading tightened, and although trading was not active, prices soared under the pull of many parties. Therefore, the noon closing price for September futures was $1,580, October futures was $1,593.50, and November futures was $1,614, with each near and far month up $9.50 to $11. The transaction volume for the morning session was 7,360 bales. In the afternoon, there was no market for factory orders, and forward yarn rose even more strongly. The rebound in the blue and gold market made many parties even more eager to absorb supply. It was said that speculators favored this market because the fluctuations in other markets were smaller, so buying sentiment was strong, creating a situation of rising prices. Therefore, September futures reached a high of $1,592, October futures reached a high of $1,612.50, and November futures reached a high of $1,635. After some floating positions were slightly released, prices softened slightly. As a result, September futures closed at $1,591, up $20.05, October futures closed at $1,612, up $20.50, and November futures closed at $1,633, up $27 from the opening. The total transaction volume for the day was 16,540 bales, down 1,330 bales from the previous day. The daily opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded on the left (net posted prices).

The management of materials in textile factories is often difficult due to the large variety of items. The biggest reason for this is the lack of proper classification. To simplify and standardize the management of materials in textile factories, Mr. Hu plans to compile a national textile factory material statistics report. To solicit cooperation from various textile factories, machine factories, and hardware stores, anyone with various catalogs or other materials to supply can send communications to "Mr. Hu Xishan, 74 West Great Road, Shanghai."

### 現棉索價過高　外棉定貨大旺

Current Cotton Prices Too High; Orders for Foreign Cotton Are Very Strong

定價廉於現貨七八十元
Prices are $70-80 Cheaper Than Spot Prices

The spot cotton market in Shanghai is active, firm, and strong. This is because foreign cotton markets are trending upward, and general speculators are eager to buy. At the same time, due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the impact of limited supply, the foreign cotton market in this city is in an unbreakable state of firmness. For the past two weeks, the spot market has remained firm, and at the same time, the majority of yarn factories and colleagues have entrusted foreign cotton firms with the intention of directly ordering Brazilian or American cotton. Although the procedures are cumbersome and time-consuming, the prices are very cheap, with a difference of $70-80 from the spot market price, which is why general cotton firms are happy to finalize orders. For example, the spot price of American middling cotton is about $670, but if ordering goods arriving in Shanghai in September and October, the price is still below $600. Therefore, the lively transaction activity of various cotton firms in the past ten days has exceeded the excitement of any spot market. The total daily transaction volume is over 1,400-500 bales. It is expected that the future of the cotton market will be historically active due to the consistent bullish sentiment among all parties.

The spot cotton situation is generally strong, and the rebound in foreign cotton has further strengthened sentiment. However, prices are too high, and transaction volume has greatly decreased. However, holders of goods have a deep-seated belief in holding them firmly.

### 糖市　雙重壓力相乘　期糖一度見新高價

Sugar Market: Double Pressure Multiplies; Sugar Futures Once Saw New High Prices

Yesterday, the sugar market was affected by the delay in the arrival of the Dutch vessel and the purchase by Japanese merchants, so hoarders had more opportunities to take advantage of, resulting in a crazy upward trend. For example, the September 10 futures contract once saw an unprecedented high of $141, and the closing price retreated slightly, but still had to rise by more than $10, with a resolution of $6-7-8. The company's futures for coarse white sugar for delivery at the end of August opened at $127, then rose to $28.60, $29.50, and tightened to $130 in the afternoon, reaching a high of $38.50, closing at $35, up $11.60. The September 10 futures contract was $128.50, $30.90, $31.50, and reached a maximum price of $41 in the afternoon, then fell back to $35.20, closing at $36.60, up $11.20. The association's quoted prices for spot coarse white sugar arriving in July were $128.50, $31.50, and $35.20 in the afternoon, up $7.70. Six-piece shares were $127 to $30, and $35 in the afternoon, up $8.50. Dutch red KD mark was $120, TN mark was $117, and $122 in the afternoon. KD mark was $125, up $10. The total transaction volume was more than 83,000 bags of spot sugar and more than 70 bags of futures. Hong Kong coarse white sugar was $122, and $28 in the afternoon. Taikoo white B mark was $158, and $162 in the afternoon, up $7. DY mark was $140, HX mark was $132, and $35 in the afternoon, up $6.

North-South Goods: Black Fungus Rises

Black fungus and mushrooms are products of the same origin, and their prices were once on par. However, due to the scarcity of mushroom arrivals and inventories in recent times, prices have repeatedly risen, leaving black fungus far behind. Recently, due to a lack of supply, black fungus has also seen a slight increase in price. Yesterday, the price of slightly higher-quality black fungus reached $980, an increase of more than $200.

### Academic Competition for Students Above Junior College Level Successfully Concluded in Shanghai Area

A total of 473 participants from 20 institutions

In order to cultivate a scholarly research atmosphere among students above the junior college level and to improve their academic standards, the Ministry of Education specially organized a national academic competition, divided into preliminary and final rounds. The preliminary rounds were handled by the schools themselves, while the final rounds were organized by region. This year marked the second session. Due to environmental factors, the preparations for the Shanghai region were not publicly disclosed. However, as the event has now concluded, a reporter from the Dahua News Agency inquired with the educational administration regarding the process. They were informed that the Ministry of Education sent senior officials to oversee the final round in Shanghai and organized a Final Examination Committee responsible for its execution. After deliberation, the committee decided that each school should submit a roster and photos of participating students. The examination papers were prepared and sent to each institution, which then assigned secret codes to the students, affixed official seals, and returned the papers. Since the secret codes could not be the same as the seat numbers, the original schools were used as the examination venues. During the examinations, in addition to faculty members appointed by the schools to invigilate and assist, the committee also hired external personnel from other schools to supervise. Subsequently, the examination topics issued by the Ministry were administered on August 12th and 13th, divided into categories A and B. Category A included Chinese, English, German, French, and Mathematics, with first-year students selecting one to three subjects from the list. Category B was divided into subjects for Colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Teachers, Education, Commerce, Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine, totaling 98 types. For subjects with similar content, second-year students (and sixth-year medical students) were allowed to participate. In total, 20 institutions participated, with 473 students taking 666 examination papers. The process went very well. As for category C, which involved the graduation thesis competition for graduating students, the institutions have also submitted their theses. The committee is currently forwarding the examination papers and theses to the Ministry of Education for evaluation. The results will be compiled and announced. Overall, the students from various institutions actively participated in the competition, and the faculty members carefully managed the process, resulting in a successful outcome. The following is a breakdown of the number of participating students from each institution and an overview of the subjects they participated in:

### YMCA to Organize Economic Cafeteria for Students

Located in the Chinese Restaurant of the YMCA on Sichuan Road

The Student Relief Association, under the auspices of the Chinese Christian YMCA, in addition to providing economic assistance to underprivileged students this year, will also establish an economic cafeteria for students. According to Yang Huaiseng, the person in charge of preparations, the economic cafeteria has been decided to be located at the former site of the Chinese Restaurant of the YMCA on Sichuan Road. It is currently under renovation because renting a space elsewhere would significantly increase expenses. Using the YMCA's facility will help reduce costs. The price of meals in the future will be kept as low as possible, as the original intention of establishing the economic cafeteria is to help underprivileged students.

### Football Season Arrives, Shanghai Chinese Football Association to Hold Annual Meeting

Meeting scheduled for next month on the 11th at the Engineers Association to elect officers and approve the list of joining teams

As autumn arrives, so does the football season. The annual report of the Shanghai Westerners Football Association was released yesterday. An announcement was also issued stating that the association will hold its annual meeting at 5:15 PM on the 11th of next month at the Shanghai Engineers Association at 220 Sichuan Road.

(4) Other business.

Content of the Report

The annual report released yesterday detailed the Association's activities over the past year, including the entire competition process and the results of all cup and league matches. The report also mentioned teams and players who were warned or punished, as well as the Yiyuan incident and other disputes. The report deemed the unfortunate incident of the previous session to be caused by a portion of the audience lacking knowledge of the rules and the actions of the players, resulting in a loss of 9,605.60 yuan for Yiyuan, not including the loss from the suspension of dog racing that evening. Last session, two charity matches were held: the November 12, 1940, Huai De Cup match between Donghua and Laker, which ended in a 2-2 draw, raised 19,119.94 yuan, all of which was donated to the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute; and the January 2, 1941, McLane Engineer's Cup match, where the Western United team defeated the Chinese United team 5-2, raised 18,650 yuan, which was divided equally between Chinese and Western charities. The Association also passed a resolution at a special meeting on March 19 of this year to donate 15,000 yuan to Chinese and Western charities.

### Chinese Swimmers Dominate in Second Swimming Preliminaries

Five Qualify for Finals

The second preliminary round of the Shanghai Open Swimming Competition was held last night at the swimming pool of the French Commercial Sports Association on Jufu Road. In the men's events, Zhong Shoujun and Chen Xingfu won the first and second places in the first group of the 200-yard breaststroke, respectively. In the second group, Gobon Begiev finished first in 2 minutes and 55 seconds. In the 440-yard freestyle, Chinese swimmers excelled. Veteran Wen Jingling defeated 220-yard champion He Jin in the first group, and Jia Jun won first place in the second group with a time of 5 minutes and 47 seconds, just a few seconds off the highest record set by Yu in 1936, which is commendable. Jia Jun is expected to win first place in tomorrow's final. In the 150-yard backstroke, only Wang Zhongren qualified for the first group as the second-place finisher. The women's and junior events did not require preliminary rounds due to the low number of participants. The finals are scheduled to begin at 6:00 PM tomorrow night at the French Association. The preliminary results are as follows:

Men's 200-yard Breaststroke: First Group: Zhong Shoujun, Chen Xingfu, 3 minutes and 4 seconds; Second Group: Gobon Begiev, Mei Han, 2 minutes and 55 seconds.

### Summer Basketball Today

Hindered by relentless autumn rains and postponed five times, the second act of the Summer Basketball Four-Team Invitational League, featuring Shanghai Star vs. All Black and Movie Star Club vs. China Strong, will continue this afternoon at the Paramount Ballroom court in Jing'an Temple. The games will still begin at 3:30 PM, starting with two evenly matched handicap matches: Jinan vs. Strong Star and Nanyang vs. Moore.

Only 400 tickets will be available today. Tickets sold previously will still be valid today. All handicap match player passes issued by the Paramount Sports Association will be valid for the four teams playing today, but all others will be suspended. To confirm whether the games will be played today, call 34393 at 2:00 PM this afternoon. The schedule is as follows:

### The Scenery of the City of Water

— Fang Yang

No threat, only novelty!

Heavens, covered with gray clouds.

The endless rain, like tears, never ceases to flow.

Shanghai has been transitioning through these days of sorrowful clouds and bitter rain.

The "riverbed" of the Huangpu River has risen three feet, and when the tide comes in, it surges onto the land!

Shanghai has become a city of water. In the near future, perhaps it can surpass Venice's "City of Water" and stand shoulder to shoulder.

The roads are all submerged in water. The yellow water from the Huangpu flows through the sewers onto the ground, creating black, smelly waves. People wade through it, and surely the "epidemic hospital" will "triple its profits."

Trams, cars, and buses have all become "ferries," fast, reliable machines. But soon, the water will rise again, "the tide is coming!" They have no choice but to "drop anchor." So, rickshaw pullers are back in "luck," temporarily changing their name. To the other side.

Leisured friends, driving their cars in the water "for fun," accelerating at full speed, with a "whoosh," the two sides of the car shoot out large bursts of white water, straight at the pedestrians walking by, hitting them in the face, making you feel a cold and "strangely comfortable" sensation, and the people in the car will laugh!

Especially if there are women walking by, preferably fashionable ones, then the "friends" riding bicycles are very fortunate. They will also go up and "whoosh" for a while, and some will even shout - "Elder sister, comfortable, right?" A hearty laugh forward, the high spirits, even come up with a few laps, they "boots" into the water does not matter, as long as there is "doufu" delicious, enough!

The waves, after the car passes, rush straight to the walls on both sides. In places where the water is deep, people cannot stand still, "plop!"

On the Fourth Road, Daxin Street, I watched an old lady in her fifties trying to cross the water street. She didn't know what she stepped on under her feet, and she leaned forward, her feet up in the air. Then there was laughter.

Unexpectedly, the old lady Deng fell into the water and did not get up. Someone said: "The water is 'vacuum', there is no air inside, so if you fall, you will die!".

The night gives the water even more precious and proud things.

The red and green neon lights are reflected in the water, making them more beautiful and charming.

Movie theaters, opera houses, dance halls, last night's continuous full-house advertisements, can be found everywhere in the newspaper the next day.

Shanghai is full of people with a free spirit.

The water gives them no threat, only "novelty".

Beggars, having nowhere to sleep at night, are immersed in the water.

The report from Pushan Villa says that the number of corpses has increased after the autumn chill. But it doesn't matter – the water in Shanghai will still be big and more. Let's wait and see!

### Not Humor

— Pei

Beggar: Sir, I haven't eaten all day. Give me five cents to buy a sesame cake.

Pedestrian: (Holding something in one hand, munching on a cake with the other, sees the beggar, shakes his head and ignores him)

Beggar: (Stares firmly, unwilling to give up)

Pedestrian: How can I give you money if you don't open your eyes to beg? (Says while looking at the hands holding the object and half a cake.)

Beggar: (Thinks it's true, gives up and leaves.)

### V Movement?

— Seifu

This is not a joke, it's a fact.

It is said that the exam for the economic subsidy for poor students, organized by the YMCA this time, had such a question.

What is the V-word movement?

It is also said that many people answered very "brilliantly." Now I will transcribe a few answers for reference

The V-word movement is the advertisement for Five Continents Pharmacy's Vitamine A, B, C, D, E in the newspaper.

Some say: When Jesus died, he launched a movement, and that movement was the V-word movement.

The movement to reorganize old morality is the V-word movement... etc.

### Social Snapshot

— Shenzhong

An unemployed college student goes to a newspaper office to post a recruitment advertisement, carefully drafting the most economical number of words, two and a half lines, costing two yuan and ten cents. He searches his pockets and only finds one yuan and thirty-four cents, so he greets the clerk: "Sorry, I'm short on money, I'll come back tomorrow."

A middle-aged businessman calls a rickshaw at the Cishu Building to go to the Great World. The rickshaw puller says five jiao. The businessman turns around and leaves. "Sir, rice is expensive!" "Yes, rice is expensive, so save some!"

Twelve Unexpected Upsets

But Shang Lao Er was a natural slowpoke, he couldn't rush anything. Before he could say anything further, he had to take out an old "Laodao" cigarette, slowly place it on his thumb nail and tamp it for a while, then bend over and slowly walk to a small table to pick up a box of matches to light it.

Liu Baldy stared at him without blinking, his anxiety rising: the right leg he had crossed on the stool was lowered and crossed again, crossed and lowered, as if he was practicing some skill there.

"What exactly are you here for...?" He finally couldn't help but urge Shang Lao Er.

"Let me tell you, the most helpless one is that little girl herself!" Shang Lao Er, holding the cigarette in his mouth, walked back and forth in the room, saying with resentment, "She simply doesn't want to learn opera from me anymore. Even if we can scare the old one, it's useless if she herself has changed her mind..."

"Then just beat her to death!" In Liu Baldy's heart, killing someone was easier than killing a fly, as if the law was made by himself.

"Who will pay for her life? Isn't that a joke!" Shang Lao Er said gloomily, "When I was about to leave, her father sent my nephew's wife to say that they were willing to send me a hundred yuan first, and in the future, if Meibao learns opera from her father, no matter where she performs, no matter how much salary she earns, they will definitely send me another hundred yuan every month for the first three years..."

Before he could finish speaking, the anger that Liu Baldy had been harboring in his stomach disappeared through his nostrils.

"Why didn't you say so earlier? If you have such an advantage, what are you still unhappy about?" He immediately turned his anger into joy, fully revealing his straightforward personality. "If I had known this, I wouldn't have been angry with you for nothing" (191).

### Old Books Newly Copied

— Pinjia Layman

Accumulating good and evil has its cause and effect, examining history is not superstition

Recently, I read the family letters of famous people of past dynasties, including a letter from Zhu Wenduan Gong (Shizu Ruozhan, also known as Keting) of Qing Gao'an to his clansmen, describing the great significance of famine relief in lean years, which can serve as a wake-up call to the public who hoard food in isolated islands. I have urgently copied it to share with like-minded people. (The following is the original text) I recently heard that our hometown has suffered from consecutive years of poor harvests, and two out of ten clansmen are starving and waiting for death, while the granaries are decaying and closed and not opened. Alas, how cruel! Gu Xian, in his Answers to Questions on Famine Relief, said: "Starving people can survive if they get a few handfuls of rice a day. Counting one stone a year can save one person from dying. Grains in famine years are limited to this number. If they are not in the stomachs of the starving people, they are in the granaries of the rich. Now, closing one stone without releasing it will surely cause one person to die. Closing ten, hundred, or thousand stones without releasing them will cause ten, hundred, or thousand people to die. Therefore, apart from the daily rations, what is piled up in the granaries is the skin, bones, blood, flesh, and brains of dead people. Saving the cost of one meal can save several people. Saving the cost of one social interaction can save several people? Saving the cost of one hairpin and clothing can save several people? Saving the cost of one donation to monks and Taoists, worshiping gods, paper money, and sacrificial animals can save several people? Using all kinds of things that can save people and wasting them on useless things is considered a heroic act. It is gathering the skin, bones, blood, flesh, and brains of thousands of dead people as a heroic act. How can one bear it!" I have tried to promote his saying that grains are produced by heaven to keep people alive, and they are only temporarily stored in our granaries. But we are stealing what heaven uses to keep people alive and turning it into murder. Murderers die, let alone killing thousands of innocent starving people. The crime is deep and the sins are heavy, and there will surely be strange disasters, near to their own bodies and far to their descendants. The inherited things in the granaries are not piled up from the skin, bones, blood, and flesh of starving people, but the immeasurable strange disasters of their own bodies and their children and grandchildren.

### Cars Fear Flooding

— Ning Ren

This year, because the Shanghai harbor construction is suspended and there is a lot of rain, every time there is a high tide or heavy rain, the roads immediately turn into the Huangpu River, and cars become boats. However, cars have many problems with flooding, such as damaging their advantages, reducing their lifespan, and increasing additional costs. For example, if a car is driving in two feet of water, its axles will of course be completely submerged. If the speed is at the normal fifteen miles, then most of the oil on the axles will undoubtedly be washed away. Just imagine how expensive it is to reapply the oil under the current isolated island situation. Secondly, the increase in gasoline consumption and the stalls caused by too much water entering the cylinder will all cause the car owner to pay unexpected costs. In addition to the above situations, the brakes may also become ineffective due to flooding. Even after the flood has receded and the roads are dry, sometimes the driver has not repaired the brakes, and such danger often causes problems for road safety and many unfortunate incidents due to speeding and the inability to brake. According to car experts, the car that fears flooding the least is the F× brand, because the position of its vent pipe is different from others. It is said that the four major taxi companies in Shanghai are very unwelcoming to flooding, although the number of trips can be increased, they cannot meet the demand because they cannot travel at the usual speed, losing many customers. Moreover, driving too slowly increases the gasoline, electricity, and repair costs proportionally. As for who welcomes flooding, it is probably rickshaws. In this situation, rickshaw pullers have a good opportunity to exert their power.

From this, I feel the seriousness of the struggle between "human power" and "machinery." (Gratitude)

### Cleansing the Heart

— Zhengrong

I read a book and found a section on "Good Ways to Cleanse the Heart and Purify Thoughts." Seeing that the hearts of people in the isolated island are unpredictable and have reached their peak, it is truly necessary to cleanse them. Only this good prescription can have the effect of curing the disease. I have copied it below, hoping that enlightened people in the isolated island will quickly take a dose, which would be very fortunate!

"Loyalty (one piece), Filial Piety (ten parts), Secret Caution (use entirely), Kindness (give as needed), Cautious Words (one flavor), Careful (ten parts), Abstain from Lust (remove the heart), Benevolence and Righteousness (widely used), Honesty (one), Abstain from Gambling (wash clean), Trustworthy Actions (use entirely), Harmony (a group), Convenience (any amount), Patience (one hundred parts), Warm Heart (one piece)

Grind all the above ingredients into fine pieces, add borax to make pills the size of bodhi seeds, and take them with three beneficial friends at any time, taking the calm heart soup slowly and warmly. Be sure to avoid knives in smiles, arrows in the dark, and storms on flat ground."

Movie Fan Opinions

### Reforming Movie Synopsis

— Jiedong

Every time a movie is released, a synopsis is given to the audience. This seems like a very ordinary thing, and although this synopsis only explains the story in the movie, its function is to help the audience understand the plot, and it is not a purely formal matter. In this way, the composition of a synopsis should be very rigorous, and it cannot be perfunctorily dealt with. However, most movie theater authorities do not value synopses, and some even regard them as dispensable. Several large movie theaters do pay attention to synopses, but they only pay attention to the paper and printing, which is too focused on form.

The first condition for a perfect synopsis is that its content is rich, not just the paper and printing. When it comes to the content of the synopsis, it refers to its text. The text of general synopses is in classical Chinese, which is often cliché. Perhaps this is because they want to be elegant, but sometimes it becomes difficult to read. Since the synopsis is explaining the story hidden in the movie and helping the audience understand the plot, then it should focus on being simple and clear. At the same time, the audience's level of understanding is very inconsistent, so it must be considered for the majority of people and not write the synopsis very deeply just for the sake of a few people with a high level of understanding. That is not helpful in practice.

There was a period when several movie theaters paid close attention to the text of the synopsis, but this period was very short and soon passed. I hope that the movie theater authorities will revive the promotion so that the synopsis can fully express its function and not go against the original meaning of having a synopsis. In addition to explaining the story, it is also very necessary to provide a brief summary of the main theme of the movie, because it can further enhance the audience's understanding of the play. I have seen the synopses of several movies that have adopted this method, such as the synopsis of "The Secret of the Wax Museum" which has a short paragraph at the beginning called "Theme," which explains the theme of the play. Another example is the synopsis of "Sai Jinhua," although it does not indicate which paragraph is the "Theme" and which paragraph is the main text of the "Story," it also has such a short paragraph of text at the beginning. However, it is very rare to adopt this method, and it is really rare to see it. This is very worthy of imitation and is not without meaning.

(Editor's Note) Movie synopses do indeed provide a lot of convenience to the audience, especially foreign movies. You must read the synopsis first to understand the plot; otherwise, people with a childish level of English, or even people who do not understand English, will waste two hours of their time and feel completely lost, which reduces their interest in watching the movie. Some hardworking young people often collect the synopses with Chinese and English translations and use them as self-study reading materials. What do you think its importance is? Jiedong's opinions are contributed to Chinese and foreign movie theaters, and I think they are worth considering.

The Torch Drama Society was established in the winter of 1936. At that time, it was initiated by Xia Xia, He Bin, Huang He, Zhang Guoguang and others. It has performed several times. After the war, the society's affairs were virtually suspended due to the dispersal of its members. Now they are active again, and their society address is at 24 Yongqingfang, Dagu Road. They are preparing to revive their performances. It is heard that the play is a five-act famous play "Love" originally written by the British Rudolf Bess, translated and directed by Zhang Guoguang, and will be performed at the Russian Art Theater at the end of the month.

### Blood Rain Qiong Pa (Beautiful Flower)

Chapter 15: Where does the powerful family force a return?

Yuan Yuan, upon hearing these words, bit her silver teeth and asked, "So when are they coming to take me away?" The foster mother said, "Today at noon. Last night, before leaving, Master Gao agreed with me. He repeatedly warned me not to reveal a word to you until they arrived today, fearing you would oppose it. Today, I couldn't bear it any longer, so I had to explain it to you." Upon hearing this, Yuan Yuan couldn't help but fall straight back, collapsing listlessly into the chair. A loud ringing filled her ears, and her vision blurred, making her feel dizzy. It was as if something was stuck in her throat. Seeing her like this, the foster mother said, "I knew you wouldn't be happy to hear this news, so I didn't want to tell you all along. However, since we will soon be parting ways, how can I not say a few words to you? Please take care of yourself and don't be depressed. Going to a noble family, you will surely live a life of ease and luxury, far better than finding an ordinary family. As long as the father-in-law of the emperor favors you, you will have unparalleled good fortune." The foster mother said this as if to comfort her. But Yuan Yuan was filled with anger, hatred, sorrow, and pain. She thought to herself, "The words the 'Flower Butterfly' said to me last night were indeed meaningful, but I unfortunately had a prior appointment with the poet and didn't examine them closely. Who knew they would have such a move? Clearly, they feared I would oppose and disobey, so they did this. It's a pity my appointment with the poet is already too late. If they come first, then I won't be able to leave. What am I to do?" At this moment, Yuan Yuan was so anxious she didn't know what to do. After a long, long time, she finally said to her foster mother, "If Tian Hongyu wanted me to go, there would be no reason to be so rushed. Waiting another two or three days would be fine. How can it be so sudden? When they come in a little while, please help me discuss it with them and try to postpone it. Otherwise, I cannot possibly go with them so hastily." The foster mother frowned and said, "Of course, I can say that. But whether they listen or not, I cannot guarantee. Think about it, the emperor's father-in-law wants a woman from our brothel. Isn't that an easy matter?" (148)

### Chrysanthemum Kingdom Chronicles

(4) Cheng Yuqing's Many Romantic Affairs (Part 1)

Cheng Yuqing was originally from the South. A decade or so ago, when the famous courtesan Hua Xiaofang was all the rage in Hankou, Yuqing was the Qin player who played the Yueqin for Hua Xiaofang. However, Yuqing had studied stagecraft in a Hankou troupe for many years in his youth. Although he later took this path, he had received considerable training in everything related to "opera." Therefore, Hua Xiaofang was able to receive guidance from Yuqing in the area of "opera," and because of this close proximity, they developed an ambiguous relationship over time. As a result, this famous courtesan of Hankou, who was known throughout the north, rejected wealthy merchants and tycoons and instead followed Yuqing into respectable life. At the time, Hua Xiaofang had quite a bit of money in her hands, so she and Yuqing came from Hankou to Shanghai to live their life as a loving couple. When Yuqing arrived in Shanghai, it was, of course, a different scene altogether. He then began to conduct further research in the field of "opera" and learned opera from the master Gu Muchao. Yuqing was very intelligent and talented. He learned the Dan roles, and he could learn any Dan opera at once. Because Hua Xiaofang knew that Yuqing had such talent, she very much hoped that Yuqing could become a "star." Therefore, she decided to send Yuqing to the North to study under Yaoqing in order to seek advanced training. At the time, Hua Xiaofang spared no effort and spent all her money for Yuqing's future. Finally, heaven did not disappoint her. After Hua Xiaofang spent several "grass-heads" (grass-head referring to tens of thousands), Yuqing finally entered the King's Gate. Moreover, after entering the King's Gate, he was fortunate to be treated differently by Yaoqing, who cared for him with utmost care. Almost everything in Yaoqing's mind was given completely to Yuqing. Yuqing's art could have reached its level today, and of course, he cannot but be grateful for the teacher's kindness in recognizing his talent.

A Quick Sketch of a Film Star

### (21) Robert Donat

— Xiao Lang

When Donat was seventeen years old, he performed in Shakespeare's famous play, Julius Caesar. At that time, he played the role of Lucius in the play and was greatly praised by the audience. In the following four years, he spent almost all of his time seeking roles he should play in Shakespeare's plays. In 1928, he came to London. After that, he began to seek his fortune in Hollywood. Although he starred in many famous films, such as "A Tale of Two Cities" and "The Count of Monte Cristo", he still could not be considered successful. Even though he was already recognized as a big star and a successful actor in the eyes of movie fans, it was not until he starred in "Goodbye Mr. Chips" that his acting reached its peak. Donat's family has moved around almost all of Europe, from Italy, France, Germany, Poland, and finally settled in England. He was born in Milton, Lancashire, and his wife's name is Isla Wassell. They have three children, the eldest being nine years old.
