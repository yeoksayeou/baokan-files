### Stimson Appeals to the Nation: Use the Navy to Escort Munitions; America Must Spare No Sacrifice to Protect Freedom; Britain's Control of the Atlantic is Related to American Security

Washington—Secretary of War Stimson, in a broadcast address to the nation last night, advocated the immediate use of the American Navy to ensure the safe passage of munitions across the ocean to Britain. At the outset of his speech, Stimson responded to those who called him a warmonger and opposed America's current defense efforts, saying, "For many years after the World War, as a citizen and Secretary of State, I devoted myself to establishing the rule of law among nations, so that disputes between nations could be resolved through judicial means instead of force. This movement once seemed very promising, but that time has now passed, and our hopes for peace have been shattered by international aggression. The world now faces a great crisis, and all our efforts must be turned to defending our own security. Therefore, I speak frankly tonight about this crisis and the defenses we should take. In 1933, a group led by Hitler seized power in Germany and overthrew the German Republic. These people, both within and outside Germany, have turned back time by more than five centuries, and are implementing their publicly declared plan to conquer the entire world. To achieve this goal, they have secretly built a vast military apparatus based on forced labor. They have already occupied Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, and have enslaved the people of these thirteen countries under Nazi tyranny. Two other countries with military ambitions have attached themselves to the Axis like vassals: Italy and Japan. Italy's crimes include the unprovoked attacks on Abyssinia, Albania, and Greece. Japan's crime is the unprovoked attack on its neighbor, China. Their aggression has destroyed the Western civilization that gradually developed in Europe after the Dark Ages. We are closely related to these sudden events, and the harm they cause within and beyond the borders of unfortunate Europe is something we cannot fully comprehend. The growth of freedom has been slow and steady. We initially believed that freedom would soon be recognized as the universal system for the entire world, but the Nazi rulers suddenly overthrew freedom, destroyed it, and attempted to establish an order in the world with themselves as masters and others as slaves. Within their territories, they do not allow the existence of individual freedom and rights. Outside their territories, they do not allow the retention of other countries' independence. Both domestic and international laws have been struck down by them. They use secret police instead of law, making individual freedom unsafe under the secret police's cruel terrorism. This is the so-called new order we face today. They have openly declared themselves to be enemies of us and our order, and are gradually encircling our Western Hemisphere. Their advance agents are already active in the republics to our south, establishing strategic air routes that run through critical parts of South America, winding towards our Panama Canal. Their armed forces are currently threatening the Western Hemisphere, seeking a foothold from which to leap to the coast of Brazil. Their propagandists are conducting extensive activities among our own people. Hitler and his military advisors, with any opportunity, will skillfully use their power to instill reactionary ideas of intolerance and hatred into the immature minds of young people. Moreover, they take advantage of modern science to secretly build a mechanized army of unprecedented strength while other countries are sleeping peacefully. They also use various deceptions and propaganda methods to catch other countries unprepared and launch sudden attacks. Now they are forcing the world, including us, to choose between two paths: either humiliating surrender or uncompromising resistance. I do not recall whether America has ever succumbed to this demand in its history. Now, please consider whether there is a need to change our national policy. First, Hitler's so-called new order is neither new nor can it ever establish order in this world. The barbaric and lawless Hitler regime is merely a temporary reaction that occurs during the long process of human progress. Since humans have existed hundreds of thousands of years ago, ambitious individuals have repeatedly attempted to conquer the world and humanity's freedom, but they have never succeeded for long. In the past, as in the future, Hitler seized the opportunity of the dissatisfaction during the chaotic period after the Great War to rule over people who were inherently docile and had repeatedly obeyed autocratic regimes, giving up their true freedom. He also skillfully seized many unexpected events that were originally easy to prevent, allowing him to rise up. Those who defend freedom, however, often suffered terribly during emergencies due to slight carelessness. But humanity will eventually progress again on the path of freedom, with new spirit and new knowledge gained from past unfortunate experiences, just as it did before. It is not only laughable, but also despicable, to believe that Hitler has established a permanent new world order because of fear," Stimson continued his suggestion that the U.S. Navy should fully assist Britain, saying, "We have built and maintained the Navy for many years. If our Navy today enables our munitions to safely pass through the sea to Britain, then the Navy is serving our country and maintaining our freedom as greatly as it has served in its glorious history. The U.S. Navy's assistance to the British Navy's efforts can preserve the safety of the oceans around the Americas. In this way, it can contain the tide of Nazism, awaiting the completion of other defenses by democratic countries, and finally permanently prevent the ruthless armies of the totalitarianists from displaying their power and leading them to defeat, and helping the tide of freedom rise again. But if our country delays aid until the strength of the British Navy and nation is defeated, then what the U.S. Navy can do now will be reduced to a very small and insignificant extent. If we allow the present urgency to pass and sit idly by while the strength of the British Navy disappears, then our Navy will only become a secondary force and will no longer be in a position to play a significant role in the world struggle. We have now made a resolute decision to proceed along the established course. The President has made speeches and appeals, explaining the dangers we face. The majority of the people have responded to the President's appeal in Congress. We have determined to be the shield of democratic countries in combat, resisting aggressive countries and defending our freedom. We have provided billions of dollars worth of munitions to carry out this defense. We also hold the tools to make these steps effective. At this time, how can the American people allow this critical period to pass by, shrinking back and listening to these munitions sink into the Atlantic Ocean? There is no precedent in our country's history for such an assumption to come true. The U.S. government or people have never given anyone reason to believe that such irresponsible and indecisive actions are possible. The German side is currently implementing unrestricted submarine warfare in the North Atlantic, sinking ships without warning and without saving the lives of the crew. According to the rules of naval warfare, this kind of submarine warfare is not a legitimate blockade. The United States has never recognized it as legitimate. U.S. spokesmen have repeatedly stated at international conferences that this submarine warfare is equivalent to piracy. In 1917, the U.S. President and Congress took up arms to maintain the freedom of the seas, prompted by this unrestricted submarine warfare, which violated the law and disregarded humanity. Hitler has not only torn up the provisions of international law, but has also expanded his illegal activities to the Western Hemisphere. Our government is currently proceeding cautiously, but for the sake of our own defense, the illegal aggression in the ocean must be limited. The President has said that we will not allow the steps we have taken to become ineffective. I do not take lightly the dangers we face. Now is the time for serious response, not depression or discouragement. I recall studying the military goals of the Axis powers and do not underestimate the bravery of their soldiers, but I also know the drive, talent, and courage of our people. I am familiar with the national defense plans currently being devised by our army and navy leaders. As long as we seek to use agile tactics and a spirit of unity, I believe the results will be satisfactory. Our freedom is a priceless treasure. Some people believe that this freedom can be preserved without sacrifice, but I am not one of them. It is impossible to preserve freedom without sacrifice. For billions of years, humanity's painstaking efforts have gradually achieved a better and more humane civilization, not without sacrifice. Today, a few evil people in Germany are destroying the freedom of others and other countries, teaching their youth, and these youth are prepared to die for this evil belief. If we are not prepared to sacrifice, not prepared to sacrifice ourselves when necessary to preserve America's belief in freedom, then our freedom will not be preserved. The only way to preserve freedom is to prepare for sacrifice."

In his speech, Stimson mentioned the strategic state on which American defense relies to defend against major dangers, saying, "The American people are greatly blessed by geography, with two great oceans to the east and west, and friendly neighbors to the north and south. We do not fear the intentions and power of our friends. What we value is naval defense. The Atlantic Ocean lies between Europe and America, and the Pacific Ocean lies between Asia and America, which can provide us with protection. If these oceans are always under the control of ourselves or our friends, they will be an unbreakable boundary, separated from any army that any aggressive country can assemble. However, the friendly control of the oceans is a very important condition. Without this condition, the oceans will quickly turn into an open path for attacking us. The development of modern air power has made the friendly control of the oceans even more necessary. Today, we must not only control the ocean roads adjacent to our coasts, but also the entire ocean road surrounding the Western Hemisphere. Because if an enemy country with a strong army and air force can land on the coast of a small and weak neighbor to our south or north, then the safety we enjoy will no longer exist. To that extent, it will not be difficult for the enemy country to establish its air force base within reach of our industrial cities, and to that extent, the only way our country can defend against foreign insults is to maintain a huge army, a burdensome method of controlling thousands of miles of the American continent beyond our borders. This situation will transform the current real neighborly relations between the American republics into an evil system of military domination that the Western Hemisphere does not want. In other words, the friendly control of the surrounding oceans is a condition for the existing mutual independence and freedom of the American nations. For more than a hundred years, the control of the Atlantic Ocean has been exercised by the British fleet. Due to the Washington Treaty of 1922, Britain voluntarily agreed to share this power equally with the United States. From then on, the United States had the same control as Britain. The British and Americans share the same language and the same observations of the traditions of freedom, and the people of our country who are of British descent account for more than fifty percent. Therefore, we regard Britain as the most important factor in the naval defense on which our safety and life depend. This is the characteristic of the situation in the past hundred years. In this century, we have adjusted our lives according to this situation. We have not maintained a strong standing army, and we have built densely populated cities on the coast, and these cities are vulnerable to attacks from the Atlantic Ocean. In short, the way of national life we have adopted depends on the continuation of British naval power, and British naval power is something we do not feel anxious about. Today, this situation is greatly threatened. The British Isles, which are the fortress against the violent countries threatening our coast from the north Atlantic, are now threatened by aerial attacks and naval blockades. If the British government is overthrown due to starvation or attack, then even if the British fleet can survive, it will lack sufficient bases to exert its power. In this environment, our fleet will not be able to fully protect the Western Hemisphere from irresistible naval power. Even today, our tonnage is still not equal to the total tonnage of the combined Axis powers. If the enemy has the advantage in shipbuilding capacity, then the oceans surrounding us will eventually fall into their hands. Moreover, we are only now beginning to build our military and air defenses. It will take at least two years to have a sufficient army and air force to defend against the Axis powers' air and land forces that can attack our country when they have naval power. Ten months ago, we began to prepare for air and land defenses, and the progress is satisfactory. However, in this vast country, it will take at least two years to train a force capable of resisting the German air force and army that has been developed for six years. Time is a key factor. Once naval power is lost, time will never be regained. Today, the British Navy is threatened in the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and Malaya. This distribution of British ships in various places is the only element that gives us valuable time. All these facts are not new. If we pay attention, these facts are revealed to us. The motivation for our government's policy is here, and our people understand this motivation and support the path taken by the government. Therefore, Congress not only passed huge national defense appropriation bills, but also passed the Lend-Lease Act to support Britain and others," (Reuters dispatch, 7th).

Opinions Vary Among People in the United States on This

Washington—Although Secretary of War Stimson's speech advocating that the United States escort aid to Britain has aroused fierce criticism from senators who advocate non-interventionism, the government seems to be very supportive of Stimson's speech, as the government's sentiment to aid Britain more effectively is also constantly increasing. Nevada Democratic Senator McCarran said, "According to the meaning expressed by the Secretary of State, it means that we have the right to participate in the war, but our naval strength is not a strength used to threaten the world, but a strength used to announce to the world that we are not afraid of aggression. We should first defend the United States, and naval strength should be regarded as sacred and inviolable. If we split this force, then we will become weak." Indiana Democratic Senator Gais said, "I strongly oppose it." Idaho Democratic Senator Clark declared, "Stimson should abide by what he said, that our navy is our first line of defense, and cannot be used as our first line of attack." Iowa Democratic Senator Gillette said that Stimson's speech showed a complete lack of candor and fairness towards the American people, which is the characteristic of American foreign policy in the past few months (United Press dispatch, 7th).

### Australian Prime Minister Arrives in New York and Gives a Speech

New York—Australian Prime Minister Menzies said last night upon arriving here, "The United States can make great contributions to humanity in air warfare and to the Battle of the Atlantic. The whole world is now watching quietly to see how long it will take for American military supplies to reach the peak of their capacity. Australia's natural interest in European politics is no greater than that of the United States. Australia, like you, is far away from Europe and lives its own life. But this war is not about European politics, but about the politics of all mankind. What the world is asking of you is not donations to charity, but a way to defend your lives." Menzies ended by saying, "All the people believe that this war affects you no less than it affects us." (Reuters dispatch, 6th).

Editorial

### Outlook on the Far Eastern Situation

The flames of war in Europe have spread to the East with the Iraq incident, and Japan has also secured a guarantee of no worries in the north from the Soviet Union. However, the Pacific Ocean remains calm, and in the short term, there seems to be no sign of sudden changes.

Matsuoka's trip to Europe did not significantly enhance the Tripartite Pact. On the contrary, what Japan is most concerned about recently is not the interests of the Axis powers, but its own pressing issues. Whether Matsuoka's talk of visiting the United States and inviting the U.S. authorities to Japan has any practical significance is debatable, but it clearly violates the original intention of allying with the Axis powers. When that alliance was first concluded last autumn, Japanese public opinion was once rampant, and even Konoe and Matsuoka made extravagant claims of not hesitating to fight the United States. Now, the Soviet-Japanese diplomatic deadlock, which Japan was once so worried about, has been considerably eased, and the Axis powers have also achieved new victories in the European war. Japan's situation is undoubtedly more favorable than in the autumn and winter of last year, but its attitude is far more restrained. Judging from the recent attitude of the Japanese authorities, it would be absurd to assert that a Pacific storm will not arise, but at least this crisis is not more imminent than it was some time ago. Considering Japan's recent situation: the Sino-Japanese war has not ended, the Soviet Union is trying to separate German-Japanese relations, and what Matsuoka personally witnessed during this trip to the war may all be enough to prompt the Japanese authorities to become more cautious. The biggest problem in all of this is probably that the current international situation may allow the Japanese authorities to relive their dreams of peaceful expansion.

Southern advancement is undoubtedly Japan's national policy, but what steps it will take is another matter entirely. Warmongering is a common trait of aggressive warlords, but winning without fighting is the ultimate ideal of all ambitious expansionists. Especially in countries already plagued by prolonged wars, launching new wars is not necessarily seen as desirable. Even with the strength of the Nazi military, its management of the Balkans only had to resort to force at the very last moment, and the same can be said of others. The Japanese authorities have repeatedly stated recently that they are willing to satisfy their desire for southern advancement by means other than force, which may truly be the inner desire of the Japanese clique. Especially when the European situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the United States' attention is mostly drawn to events across the Atlantic, it is unwilling to see more incidents in the Far East. This situation is where Japan places its hopes. In addition, after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese treaty, France, Japan, the Netherlands, and India have also successively concluded trade agreements with Japan. If this diplomatic path can continue to develop, then war may not necessarily be a necessary step for southern advancement.

However, judging from the recent movements of the United States, the above-mentioned fantasy has clearly fallen through. Last winter, U.S. President Roosevelt stated that even if the United States were drawn into a war in the Pacific, it would not hinder its support for Britain. Some people ridiculed this at the time, believing that empty words would not help in practice. However, recent experience has proven that the United States' determination and strength are indeed sufficient to match Roosevelt's statement. Of course, the failure to clarify the Far East issue before the expansion of the European war is a major regret, but the U.S. authorities' consistent disdain for appeasement policies and their refusal to give any leniency to aggressors is precisely what sets them apart in terms of wisdom. Recently, the voices for U.S. participation in the war and escorting convoys have been rising. Even government authorities no longer shy away from it. President Roosevelt's speech commemorating Wilson on the 4th of this month, and Secretary of War Stimson's proposal to use the navy to carry out escorts, all indicate that the United States has reached a point where it can no longer tolerate sitting idly by in the European situation and has reached the edge of war. But at the same time, it has always maintained a consistent and active policy in the Far East. Its aid to China has recently reached unprecedented levels, and may even increase further. General public opinion in the U.S., both in the government and among the people, has never neglected the Pacific, and the arguments in Congress are even more urgent than those regarding Europe. Judging from these facts, coupled with the unparalleled strength of the United States, it can be asserted that even if the United States is truly and unfortunately drawn into the whirlpool of the European war, it will be able to maintain a fully prepared vigilance in the Far East with sufficient strength. This trend stems partly from the fundamental belief of the United States in upholding democracy and opposing aggression and violence, and partly from the necessary measures to maintain its own rights and interests. Neither empty threats nor sweet enticements will cause it to waver in any way.

Japan has no sincerity in repenting of its wrongdoings, and the United States is unwilling to repeat the mistakes of appeasement policies. Therefore, the demand for a peaceful resolution of the U.S.-Japan pending issues can only be a fantasy. The recent calm in the Pacific is indeed a fact, but beneath this calm lies a hidden danger, and its future changes will mainly depend on the changes in the entire international future.

WASHINGTON - During the House of Representatives' discussion of the convoy issue today, Democratic Congressman Patrick expressed the opinion that the United States should immediately take measures to escort military equipment to Britain, because if Britain fails, the United States will no longer be able to protect the security of both oceans. The only plan for now is for the United States to send a fleet to escort military equipment to Britain. (Havas Dispatch, 6th)

The Chinese Side Expresses Enthusiastic Approval of Mr. Stimson's Speech

CHONGQING - This morning, all Chinese people here expressed sincere approval of the speeches made by U.S. Secretary of War Stimson and Florida Democratic Senator Pepper. They believed that Mr. Stimson's speech was even more important to China than Senator Pepper's. Political figures believed that, given Mr. Stimson's position, his speech was obviously permitted by the U.S. government, and they believed that Mr. Stimson's words undoubtedly placed the United States on the side of the anti-aggressors. It was generally believed that the Secretary of War's speech was a clear analysis of the U.S.'s position on the current world situation. Chinese people often felt that the U.S. public's understanding of the international situation was not clear enough, but Mr. Stimson's speech dispelled all of the above feelings of the Chinese people. Therefore, the Chinese people especially welcomed Mr. Stimson's speech. People here also said that Mr. Stimson's proposal that the United States should be the naval support for Britain in the Atlantic war was a "targeted" argument. If the United States does not provide escort, there is no other way to ensure that U.S. aid supplies safely reach Britain. Political figures also said that the Chinese people have great respect for Mr. Stimson because Mr. Stimson took a firm stand when the Manchurian Incident occurred. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)

Britain Believes Mr. Stimson's Speech is a Major Contribution to the Current Situation

LONDON - People here have recently welcomed U.S. Secretary of War Stimson's speech last night advocating that the U.S. fleet protect navigation to ensure that military supplies reach Britain, and they believe that Mr. Stimson's remarks are a great contribution to the general situation. Political figures expect that a senior official of the British government may soon make a statement, because it is already recognized here that Mr. Stimson's speech is very important to Britain's war effort. The British Broadcasting Corporation has broadcast the main points of Mr. Stimson's speech in German, leaving nothing out. The company also quoted Washington news as saying that U.S. officials have recognized that Mr. Stimson's speech is tantamount to an official announcement that the U.S. Navy will soon be forced to join the Atlantic war. The company also obtained many people's views on Mr. Stimson's speech, but because they are waiting for the official British response, they are not publishing them for the time being. All morning newspapers published this news in a special position. The Daily Mail's Washington correspondent believes that this speech is the strongest view ever seen in the speeches of American politicians, and believes that it is a call to encourage the American people and a stern warning to Germany. The New Chronicle's New York correspondent believes that the guidance needed by the American people and already announced by the U.S. government has now arrived. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)

President Roosevelt Convenes a Cabinet Meeting to Plan to Increase Heavy Bombers

WASHINGTON - President Roosevelt convened cabinet members and heads of the army and navy yesterday to discuss the issue of accelerating the manufacture of bombers. Attendees included Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins, Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Chief of Naval Operations Stark, and Chief of the Army Air Corps Arnold. One of the main purposes of the meeting was to consider the need for the rapid production of heavy bombers. It is reported that President Roosevelt hopes to produce 500 heavy bombers per month. White House officials said that yesterday's meeting gave Arnold, who had just returned to the U.S. from Britain, the opportunity to give a detailed report to what some parties called the "War Cabinet." President Roosevelt entrusted Army and Navy Munitions Committee member Pence to assist Hopkins in handling the details of the aid to Britain program. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)

WASHINGTON - According to an announcement by the authorities, the number of U.S. military and civilian aircraft manufactured in October reached a total of 1,493, an increase of 217 from March. In addition, the Vought Aircraft Manufacturing Plant has decided to establish a new plant in California, employing 7,100 workers. (Havas Dispatch, 6th)

The U.S. and Canada Establish a Mixed Committee to Adjust Production

WASHINGTON - Well-informed sources here have recently said that the United States and the Canadian Federation plan to establish a mixed committee in the near future, dedicated to adjusting the production industries of the two countries, in order to accelerate aid to Britain. After the establishment of this committee, its first task will be to implement the accelerated production plan proposed by President Roosevelt. It is generally expected that the President will make a statement on this matter in the near future. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)

Senator Pepper Declares That U.S. Aircraft Should Fiercely Attack Tokyo

WASHINGTON - Senator Pepper (Democrat from Florida) said in a speech in the Senate that all Americans are already willing to shed blood to extinguish Germany, and are anxiously awaiting the order from the responsible government leaders to defeat the Axis powers. Sacrificing lives now is far cheaper than sending expeditionary troops in the future. Mr. Pepper's words were extremely enthusiastic, and he strongly advocated sending troops to occupy key locations in the Far East to crush Japan. He said, "At this moment on the external front, it is time to be tough on people. The United States should cooperate with Britain to occupy Dakar, Cape Verde Islands, and other key points in Africa to the United States and Greenland. President Roosevelt should declare a state of full national emergency and accelerate aid to democratic countries. The United States should send troops to occupy various places in the Far East and imprison the Japanese navy in its nest. Fifty first-class U.S. aircraft, with dozens of pilots, can turn Tokyo into rubble. Dropping bombs on Tokyo is the only document that Japan can understand. Although I do not believe that there are already these aircraft on the way, I very much hope that this is the case. The United States must now take aggressive actions in order to imprison the Axis powers from exiting Europe, Asia, and Africa." Since the outbreak of the European war, Mr. Pepper has been a prophet in the government's foreign policy, and most of the actions he advocated have been adopted by the government later. His remarks this time have attracted special attention from all parties, and it is expected that the isolationists will respond. Mr. Pepper cited the figures from public opinion surveys, confirming that if there is no other way to prevent the victory of the Axis powers, the American people are determined to fight a war, and he advocated revising the law prohibiting China from employing pilots in the U.S. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)

Rumor That a Large Number of U.S. Pursuit Aircraft Will Be Transported to Chongqing via China

CHONGQING - It has long been rumored here that a large number of U.S. pursuit aircraft are on their way here, but this saying cannot be confirmed. This evening, after Senator Pepper of Florida made a passionate speech, expressing hope that U.S. aircraft are on their way to the Far East, this rumor was further strengthened. Some sources said that the U.S. aircraft will arrive soon, and that a full complement of U.S. pilots and ground crew will come with the aircraft. At the same time, aviation circles here pointed out that although China's aviation may have been silent last year, it has actually stepped up training of a large number of ground crew, and the equipment has also been improved. The airfield can immediately accommodate hundreds of U.S. aircraft. Mr. Pepper said that 50 U.S. aircraft, flown by U.S. crew seasoned by righteous experience, can cause a great massacre in Tokyo. All quarters in China warmly welcome this statement. It is believed that Mr. Pepper's speech indicates that the United States will truly aid China with aircraft, or even personnel, and will arrive in China soon. An official said, "It is gratifying that Mr. Pepper understands that only force can make Japan understand. I fully agree with this view." (United Press Dispatch, 7th)

### Stalin Succeeds as Chairman of the People's Committee, Concentrating Party and Government Power in One Person, Molotov Deputies, Still Serving as Foreign Minister

MOSCOW - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently issued the following order: (1) Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union and People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs Molotov has repeatedly stated that he is unable to take care of two heavy tasks. It has been decided to accept Mr. Molotov's request and relieve Mr. Molotov of his post as Chairman of the People's Committee. (2) Appoint Stalin as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union. (3) Appoint People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs Molotov as Vice Chairman of the People's Committee. (TASS Dispatch, 7th)

MOSCOW - Stalin's appointment as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (i.e., Prime Minister of the Soviet Union) has brought to an end the illogical situation in which Mr. Stalin led the entire Soviet Union in name only as Secretary General of the Communist Party. There is no news of Mr. Stalin giving up the post of Secretary General of the Communist Party. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

Stalin's Status is Almost Equal to Lenin's

LONDON - The Moscow radio station announced that Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Commissar, has been removed from the post of Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, and Stalin has taken over the post himself. This is the first time that Stalin has held a government position, as Mr. Stalin has always only held the post of Secretary General of the Communist Party. After Stalin accepted the positions of head of government and leader of the Communist Party, his status has become comparable to the previous position of Lenin. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)

The Soviet Union Observes Changes in Situations and Cannot Avoid Being Involved in the War

The London Observer attaches great importance to Stalin's self-appointment as Prime Minister of the Soviet Union, calling it sufficient to reflect that the Soviet Union is gradually believing that it cannot avoid being involved in the war. Although most experts are unwilling to draw hasty conclusions, they also recall that for five months, Moscow has been deeply disturbed by Germany's arrogance. Stalin's combination of the ruling power of the government and the ruling power of the party in one person is worthy of attention. It is quite coincidental that the German army is now extending to the Dardanelles, has controlled the west coast of the Black Sea, and has incited Arab unrest. Stalin's position is comparable to Lenin's, and it is probably inevitable that new international tensions will occur. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 7th)

NEW YORK - According to a Central Broadcasting Station report of a British Broadcasting Corporation news, after Stalin was appointed as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's policy often changed when it applied new offensives against Germany. "The Soviet Union has refused Germany's request to join the Axis powers, and has signed friendship treaties with both countries before the German invasion of the South." According to this, Stalin came to power at a time when Germany was advancing eastward and threatening what the Soviet Union called its sphere of influence in Asia. (International News Agency Dispatch, 7th)

It is Expected That Diplomatic Policy Will Not Change for a While

WASHINGTON - The news that Molotov resigned from his post as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union but did not relinquish his post as Foreign Minister caused speculation among senior figures here yesterday. It was said that the most important thing was the role of the Bald Department. Most American and foreign observers here believe that this statement from Moscow is not as important as Molotov's complete dismissal. Mr. Molotov's continued employment, first of all, is sufficient to indicate that Stalin is gradually readjusting Molotov's powers, and secondly, that the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy will not change much in the future. Only Stalin will attempt to enhance his internal political position through the superficial path of occupying an important position. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)

### Roosevelt Will Go to Canada Next Week

NEW YORK - President Roosevelt and his wife will depart from Washington for Ottawa next week. Australian Prime Minister Menzies arrived here by plane yesterday after leaving Lisbon and immediately transferred to Canada to meet with President Roosevelt in Ottawa. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 7th)

### Roosevelt's Eldest Son, James, Arrives in Cairo

CAIRO - James, the eldest son of the U.S. President, who had visited Chongqing and Rangoon, arrived here yesterday from Calcutta. He will be stationed here as a military observer with Major Thomas of the U.S. Marine Corps. Mr. Roosevelt is currently awaiting instructions from Washington regarding his future mission.

BANGKOK - According to news from Rangoon, Sir Smith, the newly appointed Governor-General of Burma, took office yesterday. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 7th)

### Plans to Build an Undersea Tunnel Between Japan and Korea

TOKYO - The Japanese Ministry of Railways has dispatched 17 experts to investigate the geological conditions of the seabed in preparation for building a tunnel between Japan and Korea, with a length of about 300 kilometers. The preparation period will take about three years. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 7th)

### Iraqi Troops Withdraw from Positions Around Habbaniyah, A Large Number of British Reinforcements Arrive in Basra, Oil Pipeline Sentry Posts Also Recaptured by British Troops

CAIRO - The British Air Force Headquarters in the Middle East issued a special communique stating that Iraqi troops have withdrawn from several positions around Habbaniyah. The positions along the oil pipeline previously occupied by the Iraqi army have been recaptured by British troops. The situation in the area near the British Air Force Station in Habbaniyah has been greatly eased. British night patrols discovered that the Iraqi positions on the edge of the highlands above Habbaniyah were unoccupied, and there were no traces of rebels on the plains south of the army's encampment. The communique also recounted the recapture of the oil pipeline sentry posts, saying that when a British reconnaissance plane flew over the sentry posts, the rebels waved white flags to indicate their surrender, and British army troops immediately occupied the sentry posts. According to the previous communique, the situation in Basra is still very calm. The Iraqi claim that fierce fighting is taking place there is completely unfounded. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

ROME - A telegram from "Stefani News Agency" in Istanbul yesterday stated that approximately 3,000 British and Australian troops were surrounded by Iraqi troops at the Habbaniyah airfield, 65 miles from Baghdad. The Iraqi troops were unable to attack because the airfield was surrounded by high-voltage electrified wire fences. Therefore, the Iraqi Air Force attempted to destroy the power plant. It is reported that the plant was built underground. The telegram also stated that British troops occupied the port of Basra and its station without conflict with Iraqi troops.

Britain Will Not Negotiate with the Illegal Regime in Iraq

ANKARA - As a result of discussions between the Turkish government and the ambassadors of Iran and Afghanistan and the Iraqi envoy, Turkey has proposed mediating the British-Iraqi incident. On May 3, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu met with British Ambassador Hughessen and offered Turkey's goodwill. Two days later, Hughessen delivered the British response. People here have repeatedly pointed out that Turkey is extremely concerned about the resolution of the Iraqi situation, but its work feels very difficult, because according to Iraqi people here, Ali Gailani, the leader of the Iraqi rebel government, must wait until British troops withdraw from Iraqi territory before he is prepared to negotiate. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

CAIRO - The Iraqi war expanded to new areas yesterday. The British made a solemn statement that there can be no negotiations between Britain and Iraq unless the "illegal" Iraqi government lays down its arms. The British Air Force patrolled everywhere, preventing Iraqi reinforcements from arriving at the Habbaniyah military district and bombing four Iraqi troop concentrations and the Baghdad-Basra highway. According to news from the London Express, the British Air Force is constantly on guard against German troops passing through Syria. The newspaper predicted that if German troops take this action, then "Britain will not allow it and will take action regardless of Vichy's reaction. If that happens, a major war in the Near East will break out." (International News Agency Dispatch, 7th)

Britain Prevents Germany from Passing Through Syria, The Iraqi Minister of Defense Visits Ankara

LONDON - British military experts warned today that if Hitler wants to take Syria to aid Iraq, a major crisis may occur in the Middle East. Germany's adventurous strike on Syria seems imminent. News here says that Britain is patrolling day and night in the eastern Mediterranean airspace to see if there are any German troop transport planes flying to Iraq. At the same time, military experts said that they believe the British fleet can prevent strong German troops from landing in Syria from the sea, so what they are worried about is the German planes flying to Iraq. Turkey's European border is also closely guarded, because it is heard that a large number of German striking forces are concentrated in the Balkans. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)

### It is Rumored That Darlan is Pressuring Pétain to Accept German Demands, Allowing Germany to Pass Through the Free Zone in France, And to Provide the German Navy for Use

VICHY - Cabinet Coordinator Darlan is currently in Paris holding talks with the German authorities. Although diplomatic circles here attach great importance to it, they say that this conversation is still in the initial stages and may not have any immediate results. It is noted that Darlan only brought the confidential secretary of the Navy Department with him each time he went to Paris, but this time he brought another secretary, which shows that the mission this time is more arduous, but there is no need for the assistance of technical experts at this time. (Havas Dispatch, 6th)

LONDON - According to news from Free France here, an ultimatum demanding full cooperation with Germany has been delivered to Marshal Pétain by French Cabinet Coordinator Darlan. It is reported that Darlan is asking Marshal Pétain to allow German troops to pass through the free zone, as well as for Germany to use the railway to Spain and the French navy. It is rumored that Darlan threatened that otherwise Germany would "obtain what it wants by force." It is also learned that Darlan threatened to overthrow Pétain because Darlan accused Pétain of putting pressure on Spanish dictator Franco to reject Germany's request for Spain to cooperate in attacking Gibraltar.

### U.S. Government Orders Ban on Machine Exports to Soviet Union; Justified by Diversion to Aid Britain; U.S.-Soviet Relations Worsen Again

Washington: According to responsible sources, the U.S. government has today ordered a ban on the export of various machines and factory equipment to the Soviet Union for use as production tools. The Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. had recently tried his utmost to obtain export licenses for machinery ordered by the Soviet Union months ago, but to no avail. (Havas Telegram, 6th)

New York: The U.S. government has halted the export to the Soviet Union of all materials that could be used for defense production. Consequently, about one hundred Soviet purchasing agents and Soviet communist personnel are preparing to leave the U.S. immediately. This was disclosed by the lawyer defending Soviet immigrant Ufanski Min after his arrest. Ufanski was arrested on Monday because he only registered as a foreign agent when preparing to leave the U.S. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)

Washington: Following the U.S. announcement of the re-imposition of a ban on all machine exports, the Soviet Union's armaments industry will be greatly affected. It is widely expected that U.S.-Soviet relations will become even more strained as a result. According to reliable sources here, export licenses already issued for machinery destined for the Soviet Union are also being revoked. The ostensible reason for this U.S. action is that these machines are needed to aid Britain, but the real reason is the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. (Haitong Telegram, 7th)

### U.S. Confiscation of Foreign Ships Bill Expected to Pass Congress

Washington: The government's initial major test on the issue of confiscating foreign ships in U.S. ports has been successful, as an amendment prohibiting the transfer of Axis ships to Britain was defeated by the House of Representatives by a vote of 131 to 94. Despite repeated warnings that this move would plunge the U.S. into "the longest and bloodiest war in history," the amendment was ultimately rejected. Last night, some predicted that the rejection of the amendment indicates that the bill will be passed. Merchant Marine Committee Chairman Bland stated, "We will never yield, we will never surrender, we will disregard the consequences of the future, have joined with Britain, and will supply it with military needs."

### Emperor Haile Selassie Triumphant Return to Addis Ababa; People Cheer the Recovery of Their Land; Foreigners Remaining in the Capital Dare Not Venture Out

Nairobi: Emperor Haile Selassie of Abyssinia victoriously returned to Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, on the afternoon of Monday, marking five years since the city was occupied by Italian forces. Lieutenant General Cunningham, Commander of the British Forces in East Africa, welcomed the Emperor into the city. The glorious battles of the British forces in Abyssinia are now nearing their end, and it is all due to Cunningham's efforts that Abyssinia was freed from Italian shackles and returned to its Emperor. The Emperor's two sons, the Crown Prince and Duke of Harar, were in the capital to greet their father. The people were extremely excited upon the Emperor's entry into the city, but Italians remaining in Addis Ababa remained indoors. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)

### North African Front: Scorching Heat and Flying Sand; Endurance of Nazi Soldiers Faces Its First Major Test

Cairo: Well-informed military sources here say that the western desert is currently filled with sandstorms and scorching heat, which is testing the endurance of German troops in the Sollum to Tobruk area. The battle situation remains the same as yesterday. Enemy attacks appear to have proven to be extremely costly. British forces in Abyssinia are gradually encircling Amba Alagi from the northwest and west, and progress is good. Observers returning from the western desert say that the German troops there are heavily affected by the conditions. German prisoners' diaries often mention the scorching heat and lack of water. The dive-bombing of German aircraft is also frequently mentioned. There are rumors that the Germans trained their troops on Baltic Sea beaches for desert warfare, and forced them to train in glass houses to acclimatize them to the stifling heat. This rumor does not seem unfounded. German tanks have proven unsuitable for desert warfare, and British mobile units are often able to approach and destroy German tanks. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)

Cairo: Regarding the East African campaign, the following war report has been released: (1) Indian troops advancing from Asmara, the capital of Italian Eritrea, have advanced 200 miles south of the city and are engaged in fierce fighting with Italian troops who are resisting from the mountains.

Eden stated at the end, "Italy's disregard for its obligations has been consistently perplexing; what it respects is force. The United States is now backing us in every way; the sooner all its assistance arrives in the battlefields of Asia, Africa and Europe, the sooner the war will be shortened. This is why I welcome the great step of the United States' decision to send ships to the sea. With American assistance, we can regain the right to live and work in peace for the countries of Europe; this is indeed our good fortune." (Reuters Telegram, 7th)

### Lord Privy Seal Defends Himself Against Criticism from Mr. Hore-Belisha

Within less than an hour of the debate's commencement, the discussion on the war situation transitioned into a more moderate exchange. Its essence can be found in the Liberal Party member Mr. Harris' succinct comment: "We are now firmly united behind the Prime Minister, but we must not deny that constructive criticism is necessary." Subsequently, Mr. Smith, a leading Labour Party MP seated on the front row, raised several questions. Like other remarks, these questions expressed doubts about the efficiency of British intelligence and whether all advice or information was always given full consideration. Regarding the justification for sending troops to aid Greece, none of the MPs expressed dissent. The sharpest speech was delivered by Mr. Hore-Belisha, who argued that if Italy had been bombed in time, Greece could have been saved. He also stated that the British Expeditionary Force was understrength, that intelligence was erroneous and its interpretation was flawed, and he described the Battle of Matapan as a lure that allowed the Germans to transfer a large army to North Africa. Mr. Hore-Belisha claimed that Britain had suffered a failure in Iraq. He demanded improved intelligence, more armored vehicles, tanks, dive-bombers, and transport aircraft. While he acknowledged recent progress in these areas, he deemed it insufficient. Lord Privy Seal Attlee responded to Mr. Hore-Belisha's criticisms, stating that Mr. Hore-Belisha was in charge of a large part of British military preparations until 1940 (to which the audience responded with laughter). He dared to assert that when Mr. Hore-Belisha was at the War Office, he must have felt that everything he did was constrained by what his predecessors had done, and that they are feeling the same way today. Mr. Attlee also said that the precariousness of Britain's position in the summer and autumn of last year was far greater than it is today. Greece's glorious resistance, General Cunningham's achievements in Abyssinia, and General Wavell's victory in Libya had brought brilliant light to dark days, but the fundamental fact that the overall situation in Europe was in the hands of the enemy had not changed as a result. While the House of Commons was holding its debate, the House of Lords also raised similar questions and held its own debate. After several hours of discussion, the House of Lords unanimously passed a motion of confidence in the government. The debate in the House of Commons is still ongoing. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)

### British Parliament Convenes; Eden Reports on the War Situation; Reasons for Failure in the Balkan Campaign; Welcomes the Great Step of American Assistance; House of Lords Passes Motion of Confidence in the Government

London: British Foreign Secretary Eden began a debate in the House of Commons yesterday on the war situation. The main points of his statement were: (1) The rumor that there were differences of opinion between the British General Staff and the Middle East Command regarding the dispatch of troops to aid Greece is a malicious message and is not true. (2) South African Prime Minister Smuts personally came to Cairo and asked him to declare on his behalf that he strongly supports the decision to aid Greece. (3) South Africa did not mobilize quickly before the coup, and only began to seriously prepare for war after the coup, but it was too late to curb the rapid advance of the German army. (4) He was deeply impressed by the loyalty and friendship of Turkish politicians and their determination to safeguard their sovereignty and interests. He knows that Turkey's loyalty to the British alliance is indeed the foundation of Turkish foreign policy. (5) He very much welcomes the important step taken by the United States to decide to send ships through the Red Sea. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)

### Eden Reveals Nazi Conspiracy at the Beginning of His Speech

At the beginning of his speech, Eden reported to the House of Commons on all the recent events, especially the difficulties of the Near East campaign, saying, "What is said in this debate is heard not only by us, but also by others. I originally wished to say more, but I am forced by circumstances to remain silent at present. I must limit my words to avoid being heard by the enemy and helping their activities. In the early days of January, the German side had gathered a large army in Romania and secretly moved troops into Bulgaria one after another. In the view of the British government, this seemed to be the German side's plan to use troops in the early spring. German plainclothes soldiers entered Bulgarian territory and occupied positions at airfields. Their purpose was obviously to use their known method to occupy Romania, gradually devastate the Balkan Peninsula, penetrate Bulgaria, surround South Africa, subdue Greece, and make Turkey dare not move. Thus, based on this position, without firing a shot, it could launch a major blow against our position in the Eastern Mediterranean from its solid base. This German plan naturally had a side effect, namely, to aid the Italian army which was fighting unsuccessfully in Albania. Hitler described to people how brave the Italian army was in combat, and said that he had congratulated the Italian army because they had defeated Greece. It is necessary to know that defeating 7 million people with 45 million people, such congratulations is almost an insult to Italy. The Greek army in Albania, though aided by our air force, fought against more numerous and superior combatants. All who observed this battle must have had the impression that it was a battle of an outnumbered force vanquishing a superior force, unprecedented in history.

### Fulfilling the Obligation to Aid Greece; Cease Further Advance in North Africa

After our army entered Benghazi in North Africa on February 8, it fought hard for a long time and had to rest and reorganize. This armored force had not only been advancing continuously for two months, but had also been fighting for more than two months without rest. After capturing Benghazi, it was impossible to order it to continue advancing. If it is said that this force should drive straight to Tripoli, this is not a big problem. Our original plan was to stop advancing after capturing Tobruk and meet with the forces on the west wing. Later, because the military situation on this route was so smooth and the morale of the enemy was so low, we decided to take advantage of the victory to capture Benghazi. At that time, there was one more thing to consider, namely, the temporary unavailability of the port of Benghazi, which would take some time to repair. At this time, if we were to advance further, we would have to use the small port of Tobruk as a base, but although this port is good, it is too small after all. We must use the mouth of the Nile as the main base. On February 8, the British government received a letter from the Greek government, stating the Greek government's determination to resist Germany and requesting the British government to show what assistance it could give and the conditions under which Britain would give assistance. This letter from the Greek government was not a request for help, but explained its position and asked us to explain our position. Under these circumstances, the British government decided to maintain the previously decided method, stop the deep advance in the Benghazi desert, and prepare to send troops to aid Greece. This was decided by the British government and its main members. At that time, the situation clearly required that everything be prepared for rapid aid, and many difficult problems, such as the position of South Africa and the need to inform Turkey of our plans, remained to be discussed and resolved. The government believed that the best step was direct negotiations, so the British Chief of Staff and I were ordered to set off. We both knew that our mission would not be completely successful. We knew how carefully the German side had arranged and how powerful it was, but I knew that we would be responsible if we did not make every effort.

### Plan to Unite Greece Against Germany; South Africa Obtains Agreement

Since the collapse of French combat power, the British army in the Middle East was forced to cope with the situation alone without the help of the French army. The number of British troops there was originally small in comparison, and unfortunately, the equipment was extremely scarce. In the early autumn of last year, the British government was deeply concerned about the situation in the Middle East. After General Wavell returned home and consulted with the Prime Minister, the government decided to risk strengthening the Middle East Army. Since then, armored forces, equipment, aircraft, and other equipment have been shipped out one after another. Generals Wavell and O'Connor were able to achieve such remarkable results in marching in the desert thanks to the power of this equipment and equipment. As far as our domestic equipment is concerned, this decision was extremely risky. Since then, we have been continuously transporting soldiers and equipment to the Middle East. Since the collapse of France, the fulfillment of the two obligations of supplying Turkey and guaranteeing Greece has been entirely borne by us. After our army arrived in Cairo, the three commanders of our side unanimously supported the policy advocated by London. We had decided in principle to send the land forces to be sent, and preparations for the concentration of troops were also underway. We unanimously decided to march on Athens. However, the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean, Cunningham, was then engaging enemy ships in the Battle of Matapan and did not participate in this decision. Both the Greek King and the Greek Prime Minister had clearly announced that Greece was determined to resist Germany as well as Italy. The Greek Prime Minister also declared that even without foreign aid, Greece would defend its territory. During the discussion, we told the Greek government what we knew about the German plans and finally decided to place the Allied British and Greek forces in the Harikman line to resist the German army. Military experts on both sides fully agreed with this quickly formed decision. At that time, we also sought the opinion of General Smuts. Smuts was a wise politician and a very experienced military expert. At my request, he came to Cairo. He fully agreed with this decision. He had made this point clear in his public remarks and asked me to declare his agreement."

### Southern Army Hastily Engaged: Reasons for Military Failure

Eden read aloud a recent telegram from the Greek government to the British government, expressing gratitude for the British army's loyal and courageous assistance to Greece. It also declared a willingness to continue fighting alongside the British Empire until victory and the restoration of freedom, morality, and international justice were achieved. Eden then spoke of the southern country, saying, "When we arrived in the south, we received various assurances that they would resist Germany's aggression against the south. However, I believe that merely saying this is of no help. What is urgently needed is a joint plan so that when war breaks out, we have the best opportunity to defend against the enemy. I have repeatedly said this, but until the coup, it had no effect. During the talks, the southern government repeatedly said that the southern army was mobilizing. We repeatedly told the southern government that matters should be handled urgently, or it would be too late. The southern government always replied that it was already mobilizing and would be prepared when the situation became critical. In fact, the mobilization of the southern country was not carried out as quickly as possible. Only after the coup did the new government truly reorganize its military. However, it was too late to move its troops to the necessary places. Therefore, although the southern army was extremely brave, it engaged in battle hastily without an effective strategy and ultimately failed to prevent the German army from directly attacking the southern border of Serbia and reaching the Manastir mountain pass. Although it is useless to discuss the matter after the fact, if the southern government before the coup could have understood the true interests of the southern country as clearly as Prime Minister Simović, today's situation would certainly be different. However, the perseverance shown by the people of the southern country is not affected by this. Since we have made a guarantee to restore the independence of the southern country, we will definitely respect this promise."

### Turkey's Friendship with Britain Will Surely Remain Unchanged

"When we were in the Middle East, we often had the opportunity to talk with Turkish politicians. The Turkish government heard about our plans for Greece. I was deeply moved by the Turkish politicians' expression of loyal friendship towards Britain and the Turkish people's firm determination to safeguard national interests. Since the outbreak of the war, Turkey's independent policy has greatly helped us. Turkey is the backbone of the defense against future aggression in the Middle East. Its importance is clearly visible. I am confident that its loyalty to the Anglo-alliance will forever be the foundation of the Turkish government's foreign policy."

### Britain Decides to Protect Treaty Rights in Iraq

Eden later spoke of Iraq, saying, "The illegal actions of Rashid Ali al-Gaylani have already caused him to lose power, and now he has forcibly seized power again. The British government sees no reason why this kind of incident in Iraq can deprive Britain of all treaty rights. Britain has no shameful record in its dealings with the Arabs, especially in its dealings with Iraqi history. It was Britain that made Iraq independent, and it was Britain that helped it establish the nation and keep its promises. I would like to show the world our current position. We are very grateful for the proposals of the Turkish and Egyptian governments for mediation. Now, our position is that the withdrawal of the Habbaniyah army and the cessation of hostile actions against the British army are prerequisites for mediation. If this can be done, the British government is prepared to discuss the implementation of its treaty rights. Britain, in any circumstances, must maintain these rights. Italian newspapers have long hoped that Britain would fail so that Italy could control Arab lands in North Africa and elsewhere. This is something that any Arab should know. In recent history, there has been no more brutal rule than that imposed by our country on the Arabs in Tripoli and Cyrenaica. Even Hitler is no better than this. On Sunday, Hitler told the world that he was a relevant bystander in the Balkans. According to this bystander, his rule is actually based on military power and secret police. The Arabs should know that the arrival of the Axis rule will be the elimination of their freedom." (Continued on page five)

An editorial in the English-language "China Press" stated that the dispatches from Tokyo, Washington, New York, and Batavia yesterday were sufficient to bring the situation in the Far East closer to a focal point. The situation in the Far East, in recent weeks, has wavered between optimism and defeatism. If these dispatches are correct, then in terms of the hope for peace, the situation is very serious, but it cannot be hastily concluded that peace in the Pacific is already hopeless.

Hoping that the Situation Will Avoid Becoming Serious

Whether it is goods or people, they firmly believe that these dispatches are sufficient to prove that the opinions of various countries around the world on the Far East, although different, are unified in their efforts to ease the seriousness of the situation. However, these dispatches are also sufficient to prove that the second step may not necessarily be the Oriental version of Lord Elgin. Japan will continue to be uneasy because of the United States' aid to Britain. At the same time, Japan hopes that the United States will focus its attention on the Atlantic and neglect the Pacific, as Japan wishes to see Britain defeated, so that the United States has no time to look west and allows Japan to dominate the Pacific. However, in fact, Britain has not been defeated, and the United States has not neglected the Pacific.

Japan Is Also Unwilling to Engage in War

Under these circumstances, Japan will certainly not act rashly and make a desperate gamble, and Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands have no intention of forcing Japan to war. From this perspective, if a war were to break out in the Far East, its instigator would certainly be Japan. However, it is also very clear that Japan is willing to avoid war and achieve its goals by peaceful means. But Japan, at least for now, cannot achieve its goal by peaceful means, and there is no other better way. At the same time, although we are juggling multiple tasks, we still have some time to breathe freely.

### Public Works Committee Meeting Today

According to the Japanese "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun," the Public Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council will hold its first meeting at 4:30 PM on the eighth at the Shanghai Municipal Council to discuss the issue of electricity reduction due to insufficient coal supply. It will review the report drafted jointly by the Shanghai Power Company and the Shanghai Municipal Council's experts on the fair power conservation by consumers. Due to the poor performance of large consumers in conserving electricity, the power company is struggling to cope. Therefore, it is hoped that the general plan for electricity reduction can be implemented immediately.

### French Concession Sanitation Worker Strike: Negotiations Began Yesterday; Employers Will Handle the Commercial Press Strike Cautiously; Western and French Laundry Businesses Temporarily Suspend Operations

The strike by the sanitation workers of the French Municipal Council has been ongoing for many days since they resumed work and then restriked over the issue of wage deductions. However, the French authorities believe that the prolonged stalemate of the strike is not a good plan, and with the arrival of summer, garbage is of great importance to hygiene, so they are trying to resolve it as soon as possible. It is reported that the police department has sent personnel to mediate, and it is also reported that the authorities and labor representatives held talks yesterday afternoon. It is generally expected that the strike has eased and may resume work within a few days if they can reach an agreement.

Laundry Suspends Operations to Prevent Accidents

The strike by all the workers in the Western and French laundry industry in this city has been ongoing since it occurred on the fourth of this month and has not yet been resolved. In order to avoid accidents among colleagues, the Shanghai Western and French Laundry Trade Association sent personnel to various laundry shops yesterday morning to advise them to temporarily suspend operations to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. It also notified the labor representatives that they must first resume work before starting negotiations. However, the labor representatives now feel the pain of the strike and can generally accept it, so they may resume work in the short term. In addition, the strike by all the drivers and workers of the Miller Transportation Company at 106 Beijing Road in this city has been ongoing since it occurred on the 29th of last month. Because of the large differences in opinion between the two parties, it has not yet been resolved. It is still difficult to predict when a resolution will be reached.

Commercial Press Labor and Management Conferring Day and Night

The strike at the Commercial Press has been ongoing for seven days since Mr. Li Bojia, specially dispatched by General Manager Wang from Hong Kong, came to Shanghai last week. The labor and management sides have negotiated twice, but no conclusion has been reached due to disagreements. The situation is now even more stagnant. It is reported that Mr. Li came to Shanghai with a plan to deal with the situation, but after arriving in Shanghai and seeing the attitude of the labor representatives, he delayed the implementation of the planned plan and had to communicate with Hong Kong again to discuss the matter and consult with the responsible persons in Shanghai day and night in order to resolve all obstacles and achieve success. According to news from the labor union, the union is determined to be consistent, take the overall situation into account, and strive for a reasonable solution. Before the management issues any policies, the union will continue to persuade all colleagues to stay at home and not act rashly. It is now known that all the steps that the union should take have been prepared, and the management will also handle the matter cautiously.

### Mr. Smith's Western Journey: Praises the Rapid Restoration of the Burma Road; Expresses Admiration for the Courage of the Chinese

During the meeting, Dr. Smith reported on his recent trip to western China. According to Dr. Smith, he was greatly surprised and admirable at the rapid restoration of the Burma Road. It is said that the courage and perseverance of the drivers speeding on the Burma Road are no less than those of the soldiers at the front line. Dr. Smith then mentioned the religious work in the interior of China, which has made considerable progress in recent years, especially the British Methodist Church.

### British Navy Association to Hold Naval Fundraising: To Fund Wartime Naval Expenditures

In addition to donating to the "Central British War Fund," members of the British Navy Association in this port will also raise funds for the navy. It is reported that members who wish to donate to the George Naval Soldiers Fund can directly remit funds to Mr. Wilkinson, secretary of the Shanghai branch of the Navy Association. According to this naval fund, it is used to comfort wartime naval soldiers and those who perform special naval tasks, so that they can get some happiness after their hard work. According to reports, the Central British War Fund in this port donated naval comfort funds, which amounted to £7,913 by last December, and the Canadian Red Cross donated the most, totaling £13,422.

### Bridges Closed Twice

The bridges over Suzhou Creek, from Waibaidu Bridge to Pentang Lane Bridge, were closed yesterday from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM and from 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM. It is reported that Honda passed through the area at the above times, so the Japanese implemented special precautions to protect him.

### Zhang Weishan Donates to the New Pu Yu Tang

Mr. Yang Yushan and others initiated a gift-giving event for Mr. Zhang Weishan's relocation. However, Mr. Zhang, considering the extraordinary times and the difficulty of resources, politely declined the many expenses of his relatives and friends. However, his relatives and friends all felt that Mr. Zhang had always been eager for public welfare, and the villagers had benefited greatly from him, and they deeply regretted that there was no opportunity to repay him. Now, on the occasion of the joy of relocation, they presented gifts to express their slight respect. Mr. Zhang firmly declined but was unable to refuse, so he converted all the gifts into cash, totaling 700 yuan, and donated it to the New Pu Yu Tang on their behalf to help with the charity. He canceled the formalities of banquets and receptions and benefited his relatives and friends.

### French Concession Municipal Council Completes Rice Purchase Plan: Urge Prompt Reporting of Sales Receipts for Hong Kong Rice; Rice Prices May Have a Greater Decline

The food problem of the city, since the Shanghai Municipal Council and Hong Kong reached an agreement to ship rice to Shanghai for sale on the 12th, the serious atmosphere was greatly relieved, and the general public was happy. However, speculators and major hoarders were worried about the realization of the facts as scheduled, which was related to their own interests, and they were anxious to maintain prices and make a final struggle while the Hong Kong rice had not yet arrived in Shanghai and the rice shops had empty reserves. But this is only a flash in the pan, in fact, it is a sign of a final afterglow. The details are as follows:

Urge Submission of Receipts for Hong Kong Rice Sales

Mr. Philip Felling, the chief of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, ordered the police departments to collect the sales receipts the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the police departments had sent police to the rice shops to collect these receipts. It is reported that some rice shops have already filled out and submitted them, and the rest of the rice shops are also rushing to fill them out. The rice shops in the Public Concession area will submit them to the Lujiawan Police Station. Once the cheap Hong Kong rice arrives in Shanghai, the legitimate rice shops will be allocated sales according to the actual sales volume and retail them to the citizens at the legal price of 110 yuan per picul. According to news from the rice industry, rice shops and grain shops have also ordered 5,000 bags of Hong Kong rice from Jardine Matheson. The remaining small rice shops are cooperating to order due to capital reasons.

Speculator's Struggle: Rice Prices Return to Level

Yesterday, the rice market, due to the imminent arrival of cheap Hong Kong rice, the price per picul continued to fall by four or five yuan. Later, due to the efforts of general hoarders to maintain prices, the price rose slightly. However, this is only the final struggle of the hoarders after the arrival of cheap Hong Kong rice, because the general rice speculators know that maintaining high prices is now impossible. However, they still try to take advantage of the empty reserves of the rice shops and the need to purchase more to make a final price increase. However, because cheap rice is about to arrive in Shanghai, households in this city, in addition to purchasing small amounts daily to maintain their family's needs, have stopped purchasing the current high-priced rice to avoid being exploited by rice speculators again.

Rice Prices Expected to Drop Sharply Today

The English "China Press" said that informed Chinese sources said that there may be a greater drop in prices tomorrow morning (8th). There are two reasons: 1. The Shanghai Municipal Council purchased foreign rice from Hong Kong. At the same time, 70,000 bags of Saigon rice carried by the French ship "D'Artagnan" will arrive in Shanghai, resulting in a situation of supply exceeding demand. 2. At the same time, the French Concession Municipal Council will complete its plan to transport rice from Vietnam tomorrow. The method is the same as that adopted by the Public Concession. The first batch of rice transported from Vietnam will probably arrive here within the next two weeks, and more will arrive successively in the future.

Rice Merchants Request Sales Rights

The rice ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Council from Rangoon is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 12th. According to Jardine Matheson officials, the quantity is indeed 5,000 tons. After arriving in Shanghai, it will be distributed to various rice shops for retail. Therefore, the company's phone calls are very busy every day, most of which are from retail rice merchants requesting sales rights. People in the rice industry firmly believe that the first batch of foreign rice will be sold out in a few days after arriving in Shanghai because ordinary residents have now stopped buying rice and are waiting for the foreign rice ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Council to arrive.

Distribution Issues Have Been Decided

Also, the French Concession authorities have decided on the distribution of foreign rice to be transported from Saigon. It is reported that the two Concession authorities and representatives of rice merchants in the French Concession have been in contact for days. It is heard that the selling price and distribution method of foreign rice in the French Concession will be implemented with reference to the methods of the Public Concession.

### Shanghai-Wenzhou Telegrams Have Been Restored: Shanghai-Ningbo Traffic Can Be Relayed Through Qingpu

After the recovery of Wenzhou, people from Zhejiang in Shanghai are concerned about the post-war situation there. Yesterday, according to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, the various Wenzhou commercial firms in this port received telegrams directly from the Yongjia Telegraph Bureau to Shanghai to buy rice. Although it did not mention the post-war situation, it has confirmed that Shanghai and Wenzhou can officially report from yesterday. After learning the news, the Shanghai Wenzhou Association telegraphed Yongjia yesterday afternoon. Due to the congestion of communications, no reply has been received until late at night. It is also learned that a traveler from Wenzhou arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He left Yongjia after the fall of Wenzhou in the late last month and transferred to Shanghai. According to the traveler, the Japanese army's attack on Wenzhou was most intense in the area near Yuhuan, so most of the towns in Yuhuan and Wenzhou suffered heavy losses in the war. The urban area of Yongjia suffered less damage. All agencies, groups, and wealthy families had already moved, so they also suffered heavy losses. However, the local rogues, due to the pressure of livelihood, took the opportunity to rob. Almost all the major stores in Yongjia were affected, especially the national companies, whose entire stock was robbed. The remaining goods storage stacks in Songmen were also robbed. It is heard that the authorities are now pacifying the refugees and handling post-war affairs. Since the outbreak of the war in the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, the water traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been completely interrupted. Yesterday, according to a reporter from Dagang News Agency who inquired about the traffic industry in this port, there are sailing boats coming and going between Cibei Songpu and Qingpu Town, which belongs to Songjiang County. Therefore, the traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo can be reached through the channel. In addition, there are boats traveling between An Dong in Yuyao and Zhangjiasha, but only individual passengers can travel back and forth and are not suitable for carrying luggage. However, it was found that Ningbo has not yet escaped the state of war since its fall. The Chinese troops attacked from time to time, so all traffic has not been restored.

### Western Newspaper Punished for Publishing Lottery Advertising: Fine of Thirty Shillings; Defendant Declares Disagreement

The English "China Press" reported that the local "North China Daily News" was sued by American priest Dr. Lai Jin to the British Consulate for publishing charitable lottery advertisements. Today (7th), after the British Consulate's Small Hall completed the interrogation, it sentenced the "North China Daily News" to a fine of thirty shillings. When Judge Haines read the verdict, he said that according to British law, the newspaper violated the Gambling and Lottery Act. Although the lottery was for refugee relief rather than commercial profit, it could not be an exception. He also said that although the defendant claimed that the sale of the lottery had been approved by the Chinese government in Chongqing and the authorities of the British and French Concessions, the defendant's lawyer, Jones, could not prove that the British Gambling and Lottery Act did not apply to China. British people in China are subject to British law because they enjoy consular jurisdiction. At that time, the defendant's lawyer, Jones, declared to the court that he disagreed with the original judgment and would file an appeal with the British Consulate's formal court.

### The Asiatic Society Exhibits Famous Diamond Models

###  Major Fire on Malong Road Yesterday Morning Destroys Six Silk Weaving Factories, Resulting in Eight Collapsed Buildings, Nine Deaths, and Two Injured Firefighters; Cause Attributed to Workers Cooking and the Closure of the Artesian Well

At around 5 o'clock yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the Ronghua area at Lane 635, Kangti Road, Malong Road in the French Concession. Eight buildings were destroyed, most of which were small silk weaving factories. Nine men and women were burned to death, and two firefighters were injured. The losses are estimated to be over 100,000. A reporter from the Huaguang News Agency, who happened to live in the area, had a more direct account of the events. The details are recorded as follows:

Silk Factories in Close Proximity

The Ronghua area has a total of 121 commercial and residential houses. Since the January 28th Incident, many of them have been converted into small silk weaving factories. The arrangements are generally makeshift. In January of this year, a certain silk quilt factory at No. 71 and 72 in one of the lanes had a fire accident. The place is still a pile of rubble. The seven interconnected buildings from No. 11 to No. 17 in the fourth lane are all silk weaving factories. The factory owner of No. 11 to No. 13 is named Ge Mingjie, who leased the factory base of No. 11 and 12 to his nephew Ge Shiqi to run the Qicheng Silk Factory. No. 13 was leased to a Mr. Li to run the Xiesheng Silk Factory. No. 14 is the Yumao Silk Factory opened by Shen Zeqin. The factory owner of No. 15 and 16, Hu Wenlong, also leased it to the Yamei Silk Factory. No. 17 is the Yuhua Silk Factory.

Circumstances of the Fire

After the electricity rationing, the factories above either stopped work or worked until midnight. However, the Xiesheng Factory owned by the Li family at No. 13 happened to be running a full night shift the previous night. As usual, the shift was to be changed at 6:00 in the morning, with the day workers taking over. At 4:45, some workers were hungry and set up a makeshift stove in a corner, using bamboo and wood scraps to cook cold rice. The flames burned through the thin wooden partition wall separating the factory from No. 14. The machine parts and silk floss in No. 14 caught fire, and the fire quickly spread to the silk threads and yarn ends under the staircase. Instantly, the fire soared upwards, bursting through the roof, and became uncontrollable. At that time, the wind direction suddenly shifted to the east and then to the west, causing the fire to spread to No. 10 (a residential house owned by the Yin family) on the west end and to No. 17 on the east end. Before the fire intensified, the neighbors tried to put it out, but since the artesian well in the area was closed by the landlords from 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM every day under the pretext of saving money, there was no water available. Although they shouted and woke up the water manager from his sleep and he started the motor, water was not available until 6:00 AM, so the fire could not be put out early.

Nine People Burned to Death

At that time, because it was just dawn, the staff and workers left in the factory had not yet gotten up. Those who woke up a little late did not have time to escape. The factory owner of No. 12, Ge Shiqi, upon hearing the alarm, rushed from his residence (also in the area) with his wife Zhou, concubine Zhao, child Minzhong, and daughter Fengying to the factory. Unexpectedly, all five members of his family were burned to death. At No. 13, the wife and two female workers (Zhang Baoying and Ms. Lü) and one male worker of the factory owner Mr. Li died, totaling nine deaths.

Firefighters Injured

Upon receiving the news, the fire brigade of the French Concession fully mobilized. At around 5:15, fire trucks arrived at the scene one after another and worked hard to extinguish the fire. However, due to the misty rain and unpredictable wind direction, it took two and a half hours to put out the fire. Firefighter No. 25 of the Songshan Road Fire Brigade was severely injured by pressure and was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

Heavy Losses

It is said that the fire caused severe losses. The value of the equipment and raw materials of the five silk factories alone is said to be over 100,000. Although each had fire insurance, the total amount was less than half of the loss. Moreover, during the fire fighting, dozens of fire trucks, police ambulances, and official vehicles were parked on Malong Road, causing the original shops and small vegetable markets on the road to close and unable to operate. This was an unexpected loss.

### An Old Clerk of a Customs Brokerage Firm Secretly Steals Warehouse Receipts and Fraudulently Withdraws Twenty Pieces of Cloth

The Shen Zhuang branch of Qianxiangyi Cloth Store at No. 2, Lane 327, Ningbo Road is opened by the wealthy Lu province native You Jumen and managed by Liu Zisheng. Recently, the store entrusted fifty pieces of cloth, each containing forty bolts, to Tongfa Public Customs Brokerage Firm at No. 78, Tianzhutang Street, French Concession, for storage at Heap 7 of the British-owned Pingzhiming Warehouse on Ningbo Road. At that time, the warehouse issued a warehouse receipt and a goods withdrawal booklet. In the future, if Qianxiangyi needed to withdraw goods, they only needed to issue a withdrawal slip stating the quantity of goods, affix a seal, and the warehouse would deliver the goods accordingly. However, Qianxiangyi recently discovered that a page was missing from the withdrawal booklet, so they inquired with Pingzhiming and learned that twenty pieces of stored cloth had been fraudulently withdrawn, with a value of approximately 20,800 yuan. They reported this to the Laozha Police Station, and detective Cao Qishan investigated and determined that Hu Guibin, an old clerk from Tongfa Public Customs Brokerage Firm and a native of Ningbo, was highly suspected. Because Hu was very familiar with Qianxiangyi, he could enter and leave the accounting room without any hindrance. He was arrested and sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested permission for a detention order for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng, an order was issued for detention pending further interrogation.

### Grains: Rice Merchants Are as Ferocious as Tigers and Wolves; The Price of Rice Therefore Falls and Rises Again; The Psychology of Suspicion Is Still Secretly Undermining; Unbeknownst to Them, the Shanghai Municipal Council Has Established a Policy That Is Difficult to Shake

The price of foreign rice initially fell yesterday and then rose again. Although the market seems to have entered a phase of fluctuation, the price has already fallen by twenty-three to five yuan compared to the highest price due to the continuous sharp declines. After the drop, genuine consumers and retail buyers seized the opportunity to buy at lower prices. However, those holding the goods are still reluctant to sell, still struggling to maintain prices, resulting in this phenomenon of a large drop followed by a small rebound. If the contracted rice arrives, the sale of Hong Kong rice at flat prices will soon be realized. Vietnamese rice will continue to arrive, customer sales will stagnate, local reserves are limited, and after the market returns to normal, such a high price will naturally not be sustainable. Even if rice merchants struggle to support it, it may not last. Therefore, the future price of rice still needs to continue to fall.

The rice merchants' psychology is still as ferocious as tigers and wolves. This is why the price of rice fell and rose again yesterday. Rice merchants have three types of psychology:

First, they believe that the Municipal Council's fixed price sale of rice is limited to the current 50,000 bags and will not continue thereafter. Therefore, they regard the Municipal Council's move as an "air action" to flatten the current price of rice. As a result, they want to wait for their "psychology of suspicion" to be confirmed. Then, the price of rice will not only be 160 yuan but can surge again and again, to above 200 yuan. The rice hoarders can then do whatever they want. The origin of this psychology of the rice merchants probably stems from the fact that the price limits set by the Municipal Council on previous occasions have been broken by the rice merchants one by one, and have frequently exceeded the limits and gone up. The Municipal Council could do nothing about it. Therefore, they believe that the Municipal Council's monthly shipment and sale of large quantities of Hong Kong rice to meet the food needs of all citizens in Shanghai is not only unsustainable but also impossible. The rice merchants like to create rumors and release hot air, so they also assume that the Municipal Council's shipment of Hong Kong rice to supply the Shanghai people also contains a factor of "air action." They do not know that the Municipal Council is the municipal authority within the Public Concession. Every action of the municipal authority must be based on its established policy and will never be like the previous price limits, mistakenly recognizing the rice hoarders as "legitimate rice businesses" without interference, which would put millions of citizens at risk of starvation. Now that they have changed their approach and cooperated with the Hong Kong government to relieve the food shortage in Shanghai, they will never make empty threats and stop at the first batch of 50,000 bags. Nor will they change the policy of selling rice at flat prices due to the rice merchants' passive resistance. If it is as the rice merchants speculate, how will they gain the trust of millions of people in Shanghai? Therefore, this kind of psychology of the rice merchants only shows that they are greedy, malicious, and ruthless, only caring about making a fortune for themselves and putting millions of people in a desperate situation, and have the malicious intention of despising and destroying the Municipal Council's orders.

Second, the rice merchants believe that Japan will inevitably invade the south. Once they invade the south, Hong Kong's position will be shaken. Then, even if there is a grain supply agreement between Hong Kong and Shanghai, it cannot be fulfilled in fact. Then, the rice that is hoarded today will be as precious as pearls and jewels. At that time, there will be no fair price and the rice merchants can be as predatory as they wish. No one will dare to do anything about it. The above two are the major reasons for the rumors that caused the price of rice to fall and rise again yesterday.

Third, the rice merchants publicly claim that if they sell the rice of the Municipal Council, how will they sell the high-priced rice they have accumulated? This statement is not unpleasant, but in fact, it is exactly the opposite. It is found that there are currently about two million bags of rice stored in Shanghai. The cost of each bag is at most just over one hundred yuan. Therefore, when the rice merchants raised the price to the highest level, they earned no less than 70, 60, or at least 40 or 50 yuan per bag. The profit is so huge that no other business can match it. "Unheard of in ancient times, unprecedented in the world," is the saying for the recent rice market in Shanghai. Even though it has fallen for three consecutive days recently (the market rebounded again yesterday), the rice merchants' profit per bag is still at least between 30, 40, and 50 yuan. The profit is still substantial. Even if the future price of rice is the same as the price set by the Municipal Council, the rice merchants will not lose money. Or some say that the rice that has recently been contracted is already high in price. In fact, the contracted amount is limited. Even if the price is high, it is all because the rice merchants have raised the price of local rice too high, which has made foreign merchants greedy and also raised the contract price. This is also the evil result created by the rice merchants themselves, so what is the blame on the public? The Municipal Council is not involved.

In short, the rice merchants must respect the position and intentions of the Municipal Council. What's more, today the Municipal Council is trying to save millions of people from the tiger and wolf mouths of the hoarders and rice weevils. And since the Municipal Council has already taken this action, there is no reason to abandon it halfway. Even if there are any accidents, they must have been deeply considered and planned for by the Municipal Council. Unlike the rice merchants who only care about killing people, do not know how to create blessings for their children and grandchildren, and do not know how to leave a way out for themselves. They are still not aware of it and are still dreaming of reversing the situation and clinging to their evil ways. How can these treacherous merchants still consider themselves human beings? Otherwise, why would they be so cruel to their fellow human beings?

In the early morning market, following the strong selling trend of the previous day, the price of various foreign rice fell again by two, three, or five yuan. In particular, the price of Xiaowen rice fell the most sharply, to as low as 125 yuan. Mixed broken rice was the lowest at 105 yuan. Other rice prices did not follow suit to the same extent. For example, the current price of Yinghuasi's original package Xiaojiao rice was 156 yuan, and the price for April-May delivery was only 153-154 yuan. Saigon No. 1 was 159 yuan, broken rice was 122.5 to 123 yuan, all of which were 2-3 yuan lower than the previous day. Subsequently, the hoarders, with ill intentions, deliberately spread rumors favorable to the buyers. The market price rebounded by two or three yuan, attempting to shake confidence in the Municipal Council. However, after the rise, a large number of sellers emerged, and the closing price still fell by one or two yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 8,000 bags of current rice and 1,000 tons of original package rice. The price of Saigon No. 1 was 138 to 136 yuan, Mindangbai was 130 to 128 yuan, Xiaojiao was 130 to 129 yuan, and broken tip was 106-107 yuan.

The sales of thick and thin japonica rice, domestic rice, are still sluggish. Moreover, the customers cherish it and are still rejecting it. Therefore, in the end, only 30 to 50 shi of early and late rice were traded, with a price of 136-137 yuan, which was 5-6 yuan lower than the previous day. Thick japonica rice still lacks transactions. As for glutinous rice, the market is scarce and it is also subject to the constraints of other goods. Therefore, it is also difficult to maintain. The opening price of Hong Kong white rice was only 125-126 yuan, and glutinous green rice was 116-117 yuan, a sharp drop of 6-7 yuan. The total transaction volume was also very limited.

Foreign rice continued to arrive at the port. The French company's Datannan postal ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, bringing 1,350 bags of foreign rice from Saigon. In addition, a large batch of 58,000 bags of corn was also shipped from Saigon and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. (Zu)

### The Flour Market Remains Weak

Flour: The current market situation of foreign flour. When the market opened in the morning, it was still affected by the sharp drop in foreign rice. People's hearts were depressed. The price of Jinlong brand Kan flour fell from 32.45 yuan to 32 yuan, which aroused the interest of genuine consumers. About 6,000 bags were traded, with a price of 32.23 yuan. The price of Huawu brand Australian flour was 33 yuan, with no buyers. However, the overall market situation is relatively stable. Because the price of rice has gradually stopped falling, and it is rumored that the Australian flour shipped to Shanghai has been turned back halfway, the future supply may not be abundant. Therefore, the market may rebound. The Fuxin factory still supplied more than 5,000 bags of flat-price flour, and a total of 8,318 bags of foreign flour were extracted, with the price still at 29 yuan.

Wheat: Yesterday's market situation has also eased slightly. Because the price of flour shipped to Japan has fallen, people's hearts are depressed. Various flour mills have not formally collected raw materials for a long time. The Nikkei market's purchase of goods has also stopped in an invisible way. It is said that the price of wheat stored in the local warehouse in the Concession is 47-48 yuan, and there are no buyers for the time being. Therefore, the market is as quiet as usual.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Corn Plunges Sharply, Then Rebounds in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains and oil cakes market was weak in the first half of the day. This was because the price of rice only fell and did not rise, people's hearts were timid, scalpers disappeared, and the market atmosphere was all the way down. Except for peanut oil, which was stable, soybean oil fell by two yuan, soybeans fell by four or five jiao, corn plunged by about two yuan, and soybean cake fell by five or six jiao. Transactions were scarce. In the afternoon, the rice market was driven by rumors and became tense again. Soybean cake and corn, under consistent manipulation, showed a rebound. It is estimated that corn rose by one yuan five or six jiao compared to the morning market. The opening price of Saigon new corn was 35 yuan to 36.5 yuan, and the old corn was 33.5 yuan to 34.7 yuan. The price for April delivery was 68 yuan. Dutch white corn was 34.6 yuan to 36 yuan. The current price of Yinghuasi was 66 yuan, 65.5 yuan, and the price for April-May delivery was 66.05 yuan. The price of yellow corn was 34.6 yuan. The current price of Yinghuasi was 68 yuan. Only the Shenji futures of soybean cake were opened. The market went from falling to rising, and it rose by two jiao compared to the previous day's market. The price for delivery in the first half of May was 21.1 yuan to 1.8 yuan, the price for delivery in the second half of May was 21.4 yuan to 22.2 yuan, and the price for delivery in the first half of June was 22.5 yuan to 23.05 yuan.

Miscellaneous grains and sesame were exported on the 8th, with 1,145 bags of soybeans shipped to Singapore, 100 bags of sesame shipped to Hong Kong, 200 tins of sesame oil, and 150 bags of sorghum shipped to Singapore.

### Finance: Hong Kong Settles Foreign Exchange

### The Gold Market Wanted to Fall, But Stopped Again

Yesterday's gold market, the price of gold suddenly turned hard in the black market, first falling and then suddenly rising. The hearts of all parties have already turned towards prosperity. The U.S. exchange rate of five yuan two five had been reached, as seen in the upper range, and then the importers, rice foreign firms, and Hong Kong power firms took action by switching from sales to pull, so it came back from loose to flat. Therefore, after the morning opening, it retreated to 6,617 yuan. Soon after, the securities firms, gold firms, and exchange firms started to cover their short positions. It was also heard that the Shanghai West firms sold current yarn and came to enter and cover short positions, so it rose even more sharply at noon, clamoring to a high price of 6,657 yuan. Finally, it saw a rebound of nine yuan. The total transaction volume for half a day was about 20,000 taels. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The black market price was very flat.

### Securities: There is Little Excitement in Domestic Bonds

Government bonds, the black market situation yesterday, again tended to be very dull. The day before yesterday, there was a slight turnaround, but it was still because the big players were unable to pull it up, and instead there was selling and it tended to be revolving and weak, brewing. There was not much change in the situation, and the bulls were tired of the weakness of the market price for a long time, and the interest they had to bear was very large, so they were frustrated as soon as they rose slightly. The lack of spirit and leisure on the stage was the most evident in yesterday afternoon's market. In the morning, because Xiexing Yuan and Hongshi bought in, Class C once rose by two jiao. After entering, the 90% and Tongkang bulls slightly released, but then it turned soft again. In the afternoon, the trading volume was extremely small, and Class B failed to open. The remaining types were only one or two market points. The market price was slightly weak again, and the situation was that as soon as the bulls raised the price by one or two jiao, there were sellers. Fortunately, the sellers were not eager to sell, otherwise it would have fallen a lot. As a result, Class C and E rose and fell, only by five fen. The remaining three types did not see any ups and downs at all. The transaction volume for the whole day was only 400 to 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

### Yarn and Cotton: Divergent Views Between Bulls and Bears, The Yarn Market Fluctuates

The yarn market turned from low to high, but the trend is still fluctuating. This is because both bulls and bears have wills, and their views are very different. The buyers said that the Shuangma warehouse receipts are dry and they look forward to the price increase. As for the sellers, the price of miscellaneous brand yarn is too cheap, and the distance from Shuangma is shocking. Therefore, the general speculators enter and exit from time to time, which is very lively. The customer side, real sales still wholesale purchase, but sporadic transactions continue without interruption. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,562 yuan, the low price was 1,544 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,565 yuan, falling to 1,563 yuan, and then to 1,564-5 yuan. The final price was 1,561-2 yuan. Today, 670 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The Shuangma market opened in the morning, and the trend was still tight. Because overseas American cotton continued to be firm, some speculators were active. The opening price was 1,553 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers rushed in, rising to 1,559 yuan in an instant. However, the securities firms continued to sell in huge quantities, and at the same time, the gold price opened looser. After a while, it fell back to 1,544 yuan. At this time, a group of bulls moved in to drag in and add weight, recovering to more than 1,550 yuan. However, the 40-count thread price upstairs was downward, a certain standard was not strong, so the pressure rice loosened, and it revolved for a long time at the edge of 50 yuan. Afterwards, bull rumors arose again, transferring the factory to collect 300 packs of warehouse receipts. At the same time, the mark gold turned expensive, and for a while the noise in the market was great, and it rose to 1,562 yuan in succession. The closing price was 1,561 yuan. The total transaction volume during the half day was 10,790 packs. The amount of each bank purchased is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 790 Same industry 10,000

### American Cotton Rises Again and Again, There is Lively Trade in Fine Velvet

However, most of the transactions are in fine velvet raw materials, so the price has risen by four or five yuan compared to before. The trade in coarse velvet is still as sparse as before, and the price has risen by one or two yuan. A total of 1,446 pieces were completed yesterday.

Dazhongji 313 Xinyu 300 pieces were sent to the factory

Educational News

### Shanghai Municipal Council: Special Education Committee Issues Report (1) - Discussion of Policy Guidelines, Narrative of Task Process

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Special Education Committee, established in October of last year, has held multiple meetings to discuss the Bureau's educational policy guidelines. It has recently submitted a report to the Bureau. The full text of the report is quite lengthy. Before discussion by the Board of Directors, it was also sent to the Bureau's Standing Education Committee to record their opinions. The main points are translated below:

Committee's Mission

The mission of this committee is: (1) To study the organization of the Municipal Council's Education Department and Bureau-run schools to determine if expenses can be reduced and efficiency increased, and to review the methods for allocating subsidies; (2) To review the Bureau's current education policy, consider whether it should be changed, and refer to the recommendations made by the Special Education Committee in April 1937, but without being bound by them. According to the aforementioned recommendations, the Municipal Council's education policy should trend towards expanding the subsidy system, increasing the establishment of foreign expatriate schools, and relaxing the restrictions on allocating educational funding from municipal revenue.

Director-General's Speech

The Municipal Council's Director-General and CEO, Mr. Fessenden, gave a speech at the beginning of this committee's establishment. He stated that the Board of Directors has differing opinions regarding the Bureau's general education policy. Some Board members believe that the Bureau should immediately cease operating Bureau-run schools, making the Bureau solely a revenue-collecting agency, allocating a portion of the taxes paid by various national residents to their respective resident groups for educational funding. At the same time, other Board members believe that this type of change would not only fail to improve efficiency but would also be uneconomical. Fessenden continued by mentioning the report on foreign expatriate schools submitted by the Special Education Committee established in 1927. The recommendations in this report were shelved at the time, awaiting the submission of a report from another special committee on Chinese schools, before being reviewed. However, the outbreak of the Shanghai War prevented the establishment of the aforementioned committee. The Bureau is now willing to re-examine the recommendations made by the 1937 committee. Fessenden concluded by stating, "I now ask your committee to consider the Bureau's educational organization in order to explore the possibility of increasing the efficiency of educational administration and reducing expenses, as the Economics Committee is doing with other Bureau organizations."

Work Discussion

This committee held its first meeting on November 1st of last year. As of the end of April this year, it has held a total of fifteen meetings. The Director of Education and various departments of finance have provided numerous important materials and forms. Under the guidance of the Director of Education, the committee members have visited many Bureau-run schools and subsidized schools. After some preliminary discussions, the committee decided that the first step would be to study the fundamental issues of education policy. (To be continued)

### Yunnan Province Selects Forty Students to Study in the United States

(Kunming, 7th Dispatch) The Yunnan Provincial Government meeting resolved to cultivate talent in various fields and decided to send forty students to study in the United States in the short term. It was also decided that the Provincial Government would allocate one million yuan for national education expenses.

### Shanghai Art Community Initiates Art Society

Now, famous painters such as Jiang Ren, Zhou Bichu, Zhang Chongren, Hu Jinren, Ding Guangxie, Tang Yunyu, Huang Zongmo, and Huang Jue Temple, etc., initiated the Shanghai Art Society on May 5th at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Huang Jue Temple presided. It was decided to plan for a meeting location, hold a permanent exhibition hall and painter's club, etc., to facilitate connection and mutual study. Currently, they are actively seeking a meeting location and recruiting members. Once established, Shanghai artists will have a place for frequent gatherings and can effectively promote art. It is heard that various individuals are actively involved, and many members have agreed to join.

### Recruitment of Editorial Talent

The Renlou Longwen Bookstore of the Shanghai Salt Industry Bank has been working hard on social investigation in recent years. It has a unique approach to the cultural sphere in the country, but deeply feels the lack of talent suitable for this work. It has widely recruited, but few are willing to carefully pursue practical matters. Recently, the store is widely entrusting various vocational guidance agencies to recruit assistant editors and investigators. Those with a foundation in Chinese and English and who are willing to work hard are especially welcome. The compensation is said to be generous.

The Hualong Cup Table Tennis Tournament, after three weeks of competition, has gradually revealed the winners and losers. Yesterday there were six groups competing. Ace player Hu Junmin, since entering the competition, has defeated opponents with a score of 3-0 in twelve consecutive matches, performing exceptionally well. He had a strong sense of certainty about winning the championship. Unfortunately, he was defeated by Wang Xingyuan the day before, leading to a failed effort. He now forms a triumvirate with Chen Tianjue and Wang Xingyuan. The complete schedule has already been completed. There are still matches that were rescheduled and not held.

Scholarly Lectures

### How to Choose Books (4)

— Zhou Liangsheng

3. On the Cultivation of Sentiment: In addition to knowledge and will, emotions are also very important in people's lives. For example, when we read, we cannot always read books on self-cultivation, deliberately seeking the principles of conduct and methods of dealing with people, nor can we rigidly read only books on science, deliberately pursuing the increase of knowledge and ability. Sometimes we should read poetry and novels to cultivate our sentiments. These types of books have a greater power to move people than books on self-cultivation and knowledge enhancement. Therefore, the selection of such books should have appropriate standards. If one makes a mistake, it will not only be a waste of effort and time but also harm the body and mind, with a substantial impact.

(1) Proper Content: When choosing books on cultivating sentiment, one must pay attention to whether their content is proper. Not all books that suit our interests are beneficial. This is like a poisonous drug wrapped in sugar. It tastes sweet at first, but will eventually harm our intestines.

(2) Profound Description: When choosing books on cultivating sentiment, one should not only pay attention to whether their content is proper but also to whether their descriptions are profound. If the content of a book has profound descriptions, we will be able to evoke our sentiments when we read it.

(3) Deep and Lengthy Meaning: The meaning between the lines is deep and lengthy, capable of causing deep reflection. Modern humorous essays are not only artistic in writing but also have implications beyond the words, with inexhaustible implications. We can cultivate our sentiments by understanding the truth within them.

4. On the Training of Thought: Humans cannot but seek knowledge. Besides reading, there are other more important things to do. However, seeking knowledge requires the training of thought. Thought training does not necessarily rely solely on reading. However, frequently reading books that train thought can greatly help us in thought training. What standards should we use to choose books for training thought?

(1) Able to Inspire Thought: General books can inspire our thoughts. However, if we want to have the ability to analyze or synthesize, then among the general books, we should choose those that are more capable of stimulating our thoughts.

(2) Able to Solve Problems: In addition to paying attention to stimulating our thoughts, when choosing books for training our thoughts, we must also pay attention to whether this book or that book can solve problems. Because books that solve problems can also train our thoughts.

(3) Verifiable through Experimentation: When choosing books for training thought, one must also pay attention to whether it can be verified through experimentation. By frequently choosing to read books that are verifiable through experimentation, our thinking will also become scientific. Westerners, in order to invent a theory, do not hesitate to sacrifice their entire lives to seek evidence, and only dare to be confident after tens, hundreds, or thousands of pieces of evidence are the same. Some books, however, may have theories that are not very accurate. Reading them may lead our thoughts astray. Therefore, we must pay special attention to this point when choosing books on training thought. (The End)

### Incentivizing Childbirth

— Xiao Yun

In recent years, several totalitarian states have "incentivized childbirth," sparing no effort.

They award certificates to large families with dense populations, provide loans to young people unable to marry, and levy heavy taxes on bachelors who "refuse to marry at a great age," employing all possible forms of coercion and inducement. However, their purpose is simply to create more potential cannon fodder.

An American reporter expressed doubt about whether "childbirth" needs "incentivizing."

He said that the American government does not incentivize childbirth, but parents have not stopped giving birth because the government does not incentivize it, and the population has not decreased as a result. According to the national population survey statistics from 1930 to 1940, the "output" of children in the United States in 1940 exceeded any other year.

He believes that rather than using coercive and inducive measures to incentivize childbirth, it is better to give the people a humane government. Allow the people to have freedom of life, to live and work in peace and contentment, with few worries, ample food and clothing, and freedom from the terror of unnecessary wars of aggression. In this way, the government does not have to fear that the people will stop giving birth. Under such a government, childbirth does not need incentivizing.

These words are worth pondering.

### The Calamity of London's Children

— Wen He

The large-scale bombing of London is astonishing, but the calamity suffered by London's children goes beyond just bombs.

London's compulsory education system has almost ground to a halt. Half of the city's schools have closed due to bombing damage or requisition by the state for other purposes. There are still 365 schools open, but teaching hours have been reduced. When an air raid alarm sounds, teachers can only announce the end of class.

Another serious phenomenon is the increase in truancy. London has 80,000 school-age children between the ages of five and fourteen, but only 26,000 attend school daily. Although officials send people to students' homes to urge them to attend class, the effect is minimal. Many parents are afraid to let their children go to school out of concern for their safety. In fact, some children are being sent by their parents to do petty trading or begging on the streets. Other children are simply loitering outside.

Another reason parents do not let their children go to school is that bomb shelter spaces need to be watched over to avoid last-minute scrambles. Every morning at nine o'clock, the children take bedding to the underground stations to find suitable spaces for the whole family. After finding them, they watch over the spaces underground. One child said: "Go to school? I have to watch the space, don't I? Mom went home, she has things to do, she told me to watch the space for her."

The air in the underground is turbid, and the light and warmth are insufficient. There are also few toilets. Living underground often poses a problem for health. Although doctors and nurses often inspect, their numbers are insufficient. One doctor works at a children's hospital during the day, and at night he also has to go to the bomb shelters, where he has to care for five thousand men, women, and children alone.

The government is urging people to move children out of London, with lengthy articles in the newspapers, as well as distributing leaflets and sending 600 personnel to visit homes and persuade parents to move their children elsewhere. Although they have spoken until their lips are parched, most people do not pay attention. Most children have not been moved out. Therefore, the Director of Education, Mr. Lansbury, later said, "Forcing the relocation of school-age children is impossible, either politically or socially."

### Reason to Not Fear Great-Aunt

— Shi

In the May 1st edition of this column, Su Caojun's "A Daughter-in-Law's Difficulties" was published, prompting the following thoughts:

Su Caojun compares private schools to large families; the principal, parents, teachers, colleagues, introducers, and students... to grandmothers, great-grandmothers, great-grandfathers, daughters-in-law, sisters-in-law, cousins, husbands, and children... This seems to reflect part of reality. At the same time, the pain he suffered certainly made me very sympathetic. However, I believe that being a teacher in this kind of environment, although difficult, is not absolutely impossible. As the saying goes, "If you're in the right, you don't need to fear the great-aunt." It is clear that as long as you can implement teaching based on educational principles, child psychology, and with all your heart, all external troubles will be solved. Even if you take a few steps back, if you can work hard without violating the principal's intentions, and enable students to benefit from it, not only will the principal look at you differently, but the parents will also develop a good impression of you. (Because it is inevitable that the principal wants the school to have a good reputation and that the parents want their children to improve.) If this can be achieved, then generally speaking, sisters-in-law, cousins, and colleagues, even if they want to create trouble, will have no way to start. Introducers and husbands, although they have no power, it doesn't matter. It should be known that schools are not families after all, and teachers are not daughters-in-law. Even a daughter-in-law can "not fear the great-aunt if she is in the right," let alone a teacher who leads a group and is responsible for changing customs!

These are some of my shallow and foolish opinions. I ask for your wise opinion, what do you think?

### Filling Hunger with Rocks

— Jin Chun

Scientists in Kansas, USA, have recently invented an economical and practical method of feeding livestock, which is to use limestone powder instead of the hay previously used. A group of farmers are all adopting it, because not only is the cost low, which can generate thicker profit, but also the cattle fed with this "food" are said to be sturdier than those usually fed with hay. Originally, livestock feed needs to have a considerable amount of calcium, and the calcium content of limestone powder is abundant. According to recent experiments by scientists, it is no less than that of ordinary hay.

When scientists were experimenting with limestone powder, it was initially because the land in Kansas was barren and there was a lack of hay. They thought that calcium supplements the body, so they mixed it with other substances and fed it to cattle. Later, they saw that it was also very good to use limestone powder alone, so they specialized in using limestone powder. Now, the experimental results show that one pound of limestone powder can feed a cow for ten days. Previously, it cost four dollars for hay. Now, by replacing it with limestone powder, it only costs twenty cents.

In addition to researching new cattle feed, scientists in Kansas are now also researching making grass into food for human consumption. It is said that the vitamin content in this food is particularly rich.

Inventions like these are not limited to a group of scientists in the United States. It is said that German scientists are making wood bread and have already made a kind of "meat" that is completely extracted from wood. Of course, it can be eaten, but the taste may not be very good.

(7) A Cross Scratched on His Face

But as soon as his eyes met Qiu Haitang's, the money-hungry man could not help but shudder. The eyes of this young man in his twenties were already filled with anger, resentment, and a desperate emotion that people who saw it could never forget. Like the wronged ghosts we see in old novels, it would plant a terror in your heart, making you forever see this pair of eyes in your hallucinations.

The door opened, and someone came in, but not Yuan Shaowen, whom Qiu Haitang was hoping for, but the heartless Ji Zhaoxiong, holding a bayonet commonly used on rifles, flashing with dazzling light.

Qiu Haitang knew that all hope was lost.

"Ah! Don't do this...you...! Don't...treat me like this...!" He tried his best to spit out the thing stuffed in his mouth, shouting desperately. Before Ji Zhaoxiong's knife could stab his face, he had already lost consciousness.

When Yuan Shaowen, covered in sweat, dragged Governor Hu with him, Qiu Haitang's body was already lying stiff on the ground, his face stained like a blood ball, one of his eyes was pierced by the tip of the knife, and it no longer resembled a human face at all.

"Who did this?" Shaowen raised his head, glaring at everyone in the yard, his hair almost standing on end.

No one dared to answer.

"Who did this? I'm going to fight him!" He stood directly in front of Yuan Bao Pan, less than half a foot away, his blood-red eyes fixed on the old Yuan's face. He had completely denied that he was his uncle. (100)

### Single-Wheel Ambulance Stretcher

— Li Yi

The stretchers and elevating beds used by ambulance teams usually require two team members to lift them, rescuing only one injured person at a time, which is uneconomical. To address this deficiency, a single-wheel ambulance stretcher has recently been developed. It allows one person to rescue one injured person, and it is also faster than using an elevating bed. The method involves fitting a bicycle wheel under the stretcher frame, greatly increasing the convenience of rescue work in bombed areas.

### From Yan Jupeng's Conversation to Losing Street, Empty City, and Executing Ma Su

— Junmei

In the Laosheng (old male role) line of Peking Opera, since Jiaotian (Wang Xiaonong) became famous for his Tan (Xinpei) style, for decades, whether directly or indirectly, those who speak of his school mostly follow Tan as their basis, but with variations and invariances. Those who vary, like Yu (Shuyan) and Ma (Lianliang), can certainly establish their own schools; those who do not vary, like Guan (Zhongxiang) and Fu Ying, can also diligently maintain the tradition. As for Yan Jupeng, he is in between variation and invariance. Compared to those mentioned above who vary or do not vary, he can also be called a successor of the Tan school.

In recent years, Jupeng has performed in various cities, and among his repertoire, "Losing Street, Empty City, and Executing Ma Su" is the most frequent. This play was Tan Xinpei's most satisfying work. His gestures, expressions, stage movements, and singing were all perfectly in line with the status of Marquis Wu (Zhuge Liang) at that time. When performed by contemporary actors, they either resemble Zhang Liang and Liu Ji or are merely like strategists and advisors. This play cannot be performed without a refined and scholarly air, without a solemn bearing, and without a vigorous spirit. Lacking any of these, even if the singing is pleasant to hear and the acting is lifelike, it is still mere imitation and cannot avoid superficiality. I have heard from old opera connoisseurs that there are several aspects of Tan Xinpei's performance that are very difficult to learn, such as: the Xipi Yuanban (a type of aria) sung after sitting in the tent and instructing Ma Su, conveying a sincere and cautious attitude; the nervous expression after hearing the three reports, the line "Sima Yi's large army is coming so quickly!" in the spoken part, and the lines "I have been cautious in using troops for decades" in the Yaoban (another type of aria), depicting a transition from surprise to regret, from hope to hatred, all conveyed vividly without stiffness. Also, the leisurely manner in the Manban (slow tempo) section "I was originally," with its repeated sighs, reveals Zhuge Liang's unwavering loyalty to the late Emperor's earnest invitation even in times of military crisis. Furthermore, the Erliu (a type of aria) section is beautiful but difficult to sing; too slow and it becomes flat, too fast and it becomes vulgar. In this part, Tan Xinpei had the appearance of "remaining calm even when Mount Tai collapses before him." Moreover, the solemn air of approaching the stage to execute Ma Su, and the Allegro section, rapid but not rushed, angry but not resentful, convey a full of grief and indignation completely in the line "Flog Wang Ping forty strokes," which can make the audience's emotions be tense and is particularly difficult to learn. Contemporary actors neglect this line and instead seek attention with contrived and affected crying, which is a great mistake! Since Jupeng has profound attainments in Tan's operas, he should be able to understand this play quite well. Could it be that he has achieved a refined and vigorous spirit? After all, he has studied Tan diligently for decades, so perhaps he will not be as superficial as contemporary actors.

### Records of Colorful Dramatic Arts

— Wen

Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun's debut film "Same Fate as Mandarin Ducks," which they produced and starred in, has been scheduled to begin filming at the Guolian Xinhua Studio in early next month. Zhang Zhizhi, You Guangzhao, and others will be invited to make cameo appearances. The script is said to be written by Wang Yin himself, and the plot is quite tight. The estimated production cost is forty-five thousand yuan.

Jin Yan recently accepted an invitation from the China Film Studio in Chongqing and will take Wang Renmei back to Chongqing by plane within the month. It is said that the China Film Studio has decided to have them star in "Marching Song" and "New Song of Eternal Sorrow," respectively. The directors of these two films have been internally decided as Cheng Bugao and Yuan Zongliu, with Gu Erji as assistant director for the latter.

It is rumored that Chen Yunshang, Li Qinian, and others will return to Hong Kong in the near future, but due to contract relationships with companies in Shanghai, they have decided not to film any more movies in Hong Kong. Therefore, they are expected to return to Shanghai to work within a month.

The China Touring Drama Troupe has signed a long-term contract for daytime performances with the Carlton Theatre. If Yan Jupeng discontinues his performances and Zhou Xinfang has no intention of performing either, they will continue to sign a contract for nighttime performances. It is said that the current daytime rental fee is more than three times lower than that of the Lyceum Theatre, so Tang Huaiqiu is now at ease and actively rehearsing three new scripts, which will be performed one after another after "Hong Xuanjiao."

Since Lan Qing joined the Green Treasure Theater, she has been well-received by many audiences because of her fluent Mandarin and beautiful expressions. It is learned that the Green Treasure authorities have decided to increase Lan Qing's salary by one hundred yuan starting from the first day of next month to reward outstanding talent.

Jin Xing's new film "Chronicles of an Isolated Island" is more than halfway through filming. It is said that the plot satirizes the general romantic youths on the isolated island. The film is expected to be completed by the end of next month, and it is also said that the premiere rights have already belonged to "Jin Du."

"Widow in the Wind" has been a great box office success at the Shanghai Theater, so director Li Pingqian has been quite pleased recently. According to Li, he plans to continue the style of the film and invite Li Qinian to star in another film, with some of the original cast and crew assisting in the production. Ye Yifang will continue to serve as the screenwriter.

After "Home," the Shanghai Drama Society has selected "Striving for Strength" as its next production. However, due to a dispute among a few members, it was forced to temporarily announce the suspension of the performance. It is now scheduled to premiere "Mandarin Duck Robbery" and "Seeking Pleasure" on the 9th. It is said that the scripts to be performed after these two plays include "Lying World," "Song of Righteousness," and "Between Love and Hate."

Ernest Hemingway, the new American writer who recently traveled and investigated in Chongqing, will have his works adapted into films by Paramount. His powerful work "For Whom the Bell Tolls," which depicts the Spanish Civil War, has been cast with Ingrid Bergman. She is a Swedish actress, and Gary Cooper is the most likely to be chosen as the male lead.

### Jade Flowers in the Blood Rain

Chapter 8: Falling Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water

Walking along winding paths to a small pavilion, Xu Jing saw Lady He standing gracefully, welcoming him with a smile. Xu Jing hurriedly bowed. Lady He invited him to sit down, and a maid served fragrant tea. Although Xu Jing was sitting, he felt uneasy. Lady He talked and laughed naturally, her beautiful eyes gleaming, asking Xu Jing about the customs and conditions of the county. Xu Jing answered respectfully. Lady He frequently sent him glances of amorous intent, and gave him fleeting smiles. Xu Jing felt a passionate warmth emanating from her eyes, and a magic that stirred his soul. He tried his best to remain calm, daring not to look directly at her like Liu Zhen. Lady He secretly smiled at his reserved attitude. She asked if he had a wife. Xu Jing had no choice but to say, "With the Xiongnu not yet destroyed, how can I think of a home? I only wish to make a name for myself, so I have not yet considered marriage." Lady He smiled and said, "I heard that when a man is born, he desires a wife with talent. You are at the age to marry a beautiful and gentle lady and enjoy the bliss of love, so how is it that you don't have a bedmate yet? Shall I play matchmaker for you?" After speaking, she giggled. Xu Jing found it difficult to answer and sat upright, looking at his nose. Lady He said again, "Do you find it lonely here? You can come in and chat often, there are no outsiders here. The old man has learned about Buddhism and is very eccentric. He doesn't come here often during the day, I'm afraid he wants to become a monk." Hearing Lady He refer to Wang Yongtai as "the old man" behind his back, Xu Jing felt somewhat displeased. He stood up and said, "I still have other matters outside, so I will take my leave." Lady He said, "Why don't you sit for a while longer? Why do you have to leave so soon?" Xu Jing said, "Since there is nothing else, I will not stay longer." Then he turned and walked out of the pavilion, still hearing Lady He giggling; perhaps she was laughing at Xu Jing for being somewhat silly. Xu Jing returned to his room, hung the Red Phoenix Sword on the wall, and sat thinking about Lady He's attitude earlier, which lacked grace. Although she was beautiful and refined, on closer inspection, she ultimately seemed like a small family's daughter trying to imitate her mistress. Wang Yongtai is old and has married such a frivolous young woman as a concubine, which is probably not a blessing for the household. He is honest and upright, and treats people with kindness, not suspecting others of having malicious intentions, but such people should be guarded against. However, how can I tell him directly? He felt somewhat troubled. Since that day, Xu Jing paid even more attention to Lady He's cousin, Sang Yiqing, because he often saw Sang Yiqing running into the inner chamber. On several occasions after Wang Yongtai had gone out, Sang Yiqing hurriedly walked out of the inner chamber in the evening, just as Xu Jing was walking in the courtyard. When Sang Yiqing saw him, he quietly slipped away elsewhere. Xu Jing could not help but be suspicious. (57)

### Summary of the Philosophy of Vigorous Practice

— Zong Yu

Spiritual life is an attitude towards oneself, it is the cultivation of the spirit, and the meaning of life, ever new and constantly self-improving, are the three pillars of spiritual life. It is by no means superficial or hollow.

### "Mandarin Duck Robbery" on Stage

— Xi Shi

Since the premiere of "Home," the Shanghai Drama Society has been performing it for three months due to its great success. Apart from the performance of "A Family of Liars," there have been no new plays for a long time. The audience has been requesting new plays several times. "Striving for Strength" was originally scheduled to premiere last month, but due to the large number of performers and the temporary difficulty in setting up the scenery, it had to be postponed. Now, it has been decided to premiere "Mandarin Duck Robbery" starting on the 9th.

The audience may be familiar with the name "Mandarin Duck Robbery"! Everyone may remember "Mandarin Duck Robbery," starring Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier, which premiered at the Cathay Theater in March. It was a literary tragedy that was greatly praised by the audience. The Shanghai Drama Society's "Mandarin Duck Robbery" is the same story as the movie. The play is originally a stage play by the famous British playwright John Galsworthy. The American film company adapted it into a movie. If we see this play on stage, its original style and charm will definitely be more moving than the movie.

The director is Wu Renzhi, and the actors are Bai Li and Hu Dao, who play the young couple in the play—Wenda and Laili. Shi Hui plays the judge Qi Si. The entire play is very tense, with both men and women dying for love. It is much more powerful than forcing a reunion in the movie.

When "Mandarin Duck Robbery" is performed, a one-act play—"Seeking Pleasure"—will also be performed. Directed by Zuo Lin. Yingzi, Shi Yuan, and Han Fei will perform it. Coincidentally, it is the opposite of "Mandarin Duck Robbery," it is a farce that makes people laugh. The performance period is only four days—from the 9th to the 12th. The society's Zheng Chen is rehearsing Xia Yan's famous work "The Most Painful Memory," which will be performed next.
