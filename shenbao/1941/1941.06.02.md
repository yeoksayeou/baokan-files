### US Offers Guarantees to China: Will Abandon Special Privileges in China After the War; Hull and Guo Taiqi Officially Exchange Documents, Mutually Pledging to Promote Trade Freedom and Cultural Cooperation

Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that as soon as China regains peace, the United States will take action to abolish consular jurisdiction in China. Hull released the letters exchanged between him and Dr. Guo Taiqi, the former Chinese envoy to the UK and soon-to-be Foreign Minister of China. In the letters, Dr. Guo Taiqi pledged that when China regains peace, it will fully seek greater freedom in international trade and more extensive cultural exchange. Hull said, "We unconditionally believe that the principles we follow with China and other countries (national security and fair dealings among nations) will prevail." Guo wrote to Hull from San Francisco on May 26, expressing his gratitude for the Secretary of State's hospitality and for Hull's announcement of the United States' foreign policy. Guo also said that he hopes the world situation will permit freer trade and broader cultural cooperation among nations. He also said, "When peace is restored, the Chinese government hopes and believes that it can seek the most effective means to implement its own economic policies and its own political and economic relations with foreign countries." Hull replied, "As you know, the United States government and people have a deep interest in the well-being and progress of China. It goes without saying that after China regains peace, the United States will begin to unite with countries enjoying consular jurisdiction in China, to negotiate with the Chinese government in a systematic manner to abolish the last few special rights retained in China." Hull also said, "Our country welcomes and encourages any country to move towards peace, security, stability, fairness, and general well-being through legitimate and orderly steps. The guarantees you have made in your letter regarding China's support for the principle of equal respect in economic relations should have a sound effect during the current world conflict and after the cessation of hostilities. The United States government has an obligation to support the principles that the people believe in," (A United Press dispatch)

### Contents of the Exchange of Letters Between the Two Countries

Washington: The full text of the letters exchanged between the new Chinese Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi and the U.S. Secretary of State is as follows: "Letter from Foreign Minister Guo to Hull" (omitted above). "During my recent visit, I was honored to receive your explanation of the attitudes and policies held by the United States on economic and political issues related to the whole world, and I was given a detailed presentation of the attitudes and policies held on political and economic issues related to our two countries. At this time of global turmoil, violence, and deep suffering, hearing your insightful remarks filled me with admiration. You previously made a public statement on July 16, 1937, clarifying the general policy of the United States government. I am familiar with the content of that statement. Therefore, I fully understand the importance of your explanation in our previous talks regarding how your country values the principles of a world legal order, equality of treatment among nations, and the need to realize freer trade and larger-scale cultural exchange among nations. My government shares the same sentiment with your government and hopes that orderly progress can be achieved internationally through agreements. The principles you mentioned will surely be universally accepted and implemented internationally. My government previously sent a note to your government on August 12, 1937, expressing support for the principles listed in your statement of July 16, 1937, and explaining China's policy, which coincided with the views of your government. I believe you will recall this matter. China's position at that time has been clearly stated and has not changed slightly to this day. My country has been fighting for self-defense for nearly four years. For the past four years, the United States government and people have always expressed great friendship and sympathy to the government and people of China. The Chinese government and people are deeply grateful for the attitude reforms and actions of the United States government. We also believe that the evolution of our attitude, purpose, and policies is increasingly and completely in line with the United States. Our people must believe that international business relations should not have any discrimination and should further implement the principles of broad cooperation and justice, that is, to faithfully fulfill international treaties and that all international issues should be resolved through peaceful negotiation procedures and free and peaceful negotiation methods."

"Hull's Reply to Foreign Minister Guo" The United States government has decided to welcome and encourage any country that makes requests in a legitimate and orderly manner to promote peace, security, order, fairness, and the welfare of all people. The principles of fairness and equal treatment that your country has decided to support in the economic field, as mentioned in your letter, have a significant impact on the present and after the war. Our country has also decided to follow the policies supported by our people. (A one-day dispatch)

### Chongqing Expresses Welcome

Chongqing: Chinese officials today warmly welcomed the statement by the U.S. Secretary of State that the United States will be prepared to abandon consular jurisdiction after China regains peace. The Chinese side said that this is a concrete proof of the United States' goodwill, sympathy, and belief in the future of China. The Chinese side especially appreciates the timeliness of this gesture by the United States. The Chinese side pointed out that the Nanjing regime had cooperated with Japan to unilaterally abolish consular jurisdiction. Officials here said that if such a plan were to be realized, it would deeply win the hearts of the people for the Nanjing regime. However, the United States is now proposing to achieve the same goal through orderly negotiations, which will surely thwart the Nanjing regime's plan. It is believed that Hull's actions can also refute the Japanese propaganda that the central government has mortgaged China to the United States in order to obtain large-scale American aid, which would inevitably lead China to become a semi-colonial status.

Semi-official sources pointed out that Hull's promise is in accordance with the United States' policy of fulfilling China's desire to achieve international equality. They declared that this policy will greatly increase the friendship between China and the United States and will improve the future prospects for good business relations. Officials also recalled that the United States was the first to sign an agreement with China, granting China tariff autonomy. After commenting on this matter, an official told a United Press reporter, "We believe that the United States will be the first to sign a treaty with China based on complete equality."

### U.S. Senator Norris Issues a Warning: If the U.S. Trusts Japan, It Will Eventually Bring Trouble Upon Itself

Washington: Senator Norris warned yesterday that the United States must not trust Japan. Even if the U.S. and Japan sign a non-aggression treaty, the possibility of Japan attacking the U.S. is still greater than people imagine. He said that Japan can attack the U.S. at any time because Tokyo has decided on such a plan and Japan is confident of winning. Norris also urged the U.S. to carefully consider Japan and Germany as the U.S.'s biggest enemies and suggested that all ports on the Pacific coast must maintain strong defense forces.

### He Yingqin Gives a Speech: There is Still Fierce Fighting in the Zhongtiao Mountains; He Tells U.S. Reporters That No Rift Will Occur With the Communists; Most of the Chinese Army Is Still Defending Positions in the Mountainous Area of Southern Shanxi

Chongqing: Chief of Staff and Minister of Military Administration General He Yingqin said today that if China wants to win the war against Japan, it must first eliminate the Eighteenth Group Army of the Communist Party. Minister He said in a private meeting with a special correspondent from the United Press that if the Communist Party obeys orders, follows the country's war policy, and abandons all its past illegal activities, such as attacking the Central Army, disobeying Central orders, and issuing currencies, then the central government will not hold them accountable for the past. He also reiterated that President Chiang Kai-shek had recently assured the National Political Council that the government would no longer carry out communist suppression campaigns. Minister He also said that he believes that the Central Army and the Communist Party will not openly break apart because the Communist Party does not dare to openly oppose the government, otherwise, it will be regarded as a traitor assisting Japan and will be abandoned by the people. Minister He said that the Communist Party only needs not to attack friendly forces to prevent Japan from succeeding and to complete the Communist Party's mission. Previously, the Japanese army had four mixed brigades stationed in the Communist Party's defense zone in northern Shanxi, but recently it has transferred most of these troops to southern Shanxi to fight. The central government has had to retain a portion of its elite troops to prevent possible attacks by the Communist Party. If the Communist Party attacks the Japanese army, so that this portion of the Central Army does not need to defend against them, then the Chinese army can fight together, even if the Japanese army increases by ten divisions more than the current number, there is nothing to fear. Minister He also told reporters in detail about the Communist army's attacks on the Central Army, but said that he did not want to publicize this situation because he did not want to provoke division and hostility. Minister He also said that the Chinese army has not completely withdrawn from the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi. He said that the Japanese army mobilized six divisions and three brigades, intending to trap the Chinese army in the mountains. Therefore, the Chinese army was divided into two parts: one part crossed the Yellow River and established positions on the south bank, and the other part crossed the Japanese army's rear in the north of the Zhongtiao Mountains. There are still many Chinese troops remaining in the mountainous and rugged areas because the Japanese army only occupies valleys and passes. There is still fierce fighting there, and the fighting is favorable to the Chinese side. When asked about the participation of the Eighteenth Group Army in the war, Minister He replied that General Wei Lihuang, the commander of the war zone, had received a guarantee from the representative of the Eighteenth Group Army stationed in Luoyang that the Communist army would harass the Japanese transportation lines and would participate in the battle of the Zhongtiao Mountains. He said that he had not received a formal report from General Wei Lihuang that the Eighteenth Group Army had implemented its plan. He admitted that he had been repeatedly accused by the Communist Party of being pro-Japanese, but he presented reporters with a piece of political history that had never been known to refute this accusation. He said, "Between 1933 and 1935, I had a very good opportunity to be pro-Japanese in North China. Japan at that time very much wanted China to sign an anti-communist pact and offered me generous terms, saying that if China joined the anti-communist defense line in North China, Japan would abolish all Japanese concessions in China and abolish the provisions of the Boxer Protocol. I refused to consider these terms because Japan wanted to use anti-communism to interfere in China's internal affairs and to make China attack a 'friendly nation,'" (A one-day United Press dispatch)

Japanese Offensive Fails Again

Chongqing: An editorial in the Central Daily News yesterday morning stated that the Japanese army's summer offensives on all fronts have failed. After a month of fighting on the Fujian and Zhejiang coasts, the Japanese army can only occupy Ningbo and Fuzhou, while Wenzhou, Haimen, and Fuqing have been recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in southern Henan and northern Hubei attacked the Chinese army in the Dabie Mountains but suffered heavy losses and was eventually driven back to the original line in Suixian County. The Japanese army in southern Shanxi attacked the Zhongtiao Mountains with a force of 140,000, suffering casualties of up to 40,000. The Chinese army has moved to a new position and is currently launching a counter-offensive in the area of Qinshui, Gaoping, and Jiyuan. The Chinese army in northwestern Shanxi is also attacking Japanese army positions along the Pinghan Railway. The Chinese army in eastern Guangdong is also launching a counter-offensive, recapturing Huiyang and currently besieging Danshui. The failure of the Japanese army's summer offensive has proven that Japan is neither able to penetrate deep into the Chinese mainland nor has sufficient strength to advance southward. (A one-day Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing: Fierce fighting is currently taking place on the road starting from Hongdong along the Tongpu Railway to Tongliu (transliteration), because after the Chinese army moved north from the Zhongtiao Mountains, it is now advancing to the rear of the Japanese army. (A one-day Reuters dispatch)

Zhou Enlai's Statement

Chongqing: Communist leader Zhou Enlai recently issued a statement responding to accusations that the Communist army has not participated in the current war in Shanxi. Zhou also published a special article in the Xinhua Daily on the Communist Party's views on the international situation. Early this morning, Communist personnel in a special car delivered the newspaper containing the article to the press conference and distributed it to foreign reporters. Zhou responded to the remarks of a Chinese army spokesperson condemning the Communist army for not yet having contact with the Japanese. Since the outbreak of the battle of the Zhongtiao Mountains, the highest command of the Chinese army has inquired about the cooperation of the Communist Party. He (Zhou himself) immediately expressed his opinion that the CCP has always supported the government that continues to resist, so there is no doubt that the Eighteenth Group Army will join the war. Soon after, he received a telegram from Zhu De and Peng Dehuai, the commander and deputy commander of the Eighteenth Group Army, announcing their readiness to cooperate in resisting the war and listing their combat plans. This telegram was immediately submitted to the Supreme Command, which decided that Zhu De and Peng Dehuai should contact the commander-in-chief of the war zone. According to the latest war news received, it has been proven that the Communist army in eastern Shanxi and the Dabie Mountains in northern Shanxi is currently fighting with the Japanese. Zhou claimed that the Communist army is not afraid of the Japanese army and is prepared to fight them on the battlefield. He hopes that the people of the whole country will not be misled by the enemy's propaganda. In his article on the international situation, Zhou said that in the West there is a conspiracy for Britain and Germany to compromise in order to deal with the Soviet Union, and in the East there are rumors of the United States reconciling with Japan (two-day Reuters dispatch).

Chongqing: Zhou Enlai, the Communist representative stationed in Chongqing, declared in the Xinhua Daily today that the most important undercurrent in the Far East is the desire for the United States to come forward to make peace between China and Japan. Zhou said that the Japanese business and diplomatic circles want the United States to mediate the war because President Roosevelt's recent fireside chat did not mention Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka also hope to negotiate directly with the Chongqing government. Zhou said that this kind of undercurrent in the Far East does not shake our determination to fight. On the contrary, this kind of undercurrent will strengthen our will to fight. Zhou also said that the undercurrent in Europe is the desire to establish a British-German joint front to confront the Soviet Union. Hess's flight to England has activated this undercurrent completely. A common anti-Soviet front between London and Berlin has developed rapidly in those two places, but the longer the war drags on, the more the military strength of the Soviet Union will be strengthened.

Editorial

### US Far East Policy Remains Unchanged

For some time, there has been an invisible undercurrent in the international community, which, with various gestures, still anticipates the revival of the appeasement policy for the clearly divided current situation in the Far East. Of course, some of them are just baseless rumors of a nerve war nature and are not worth paying attention to, but the intention of some people to separate the Far East issue from the European war due to the serious Nazi threat cannot be ignored either. In addition, after Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka returned from Europe, he once revealed his fantasies about the United States, and various subtle proposals such as Matsuoka's visit to the United States and the invitation of the US head of state to visit Japan have also been intermittently publicized in newspapers and by the people. The news from the US side that Japan is indifferent to the Axis powers is precisely caused by such impressions, thus creating a fantasy that Japan can be induced to break away from the Axis powers through an appeasement policy. Half a month ago, British Foreign Secretary Eden resolutely explained the British government's Far East policy in the House of Commons. After the publication of Roosevelt's fireside chat, Secretary of State Hull reiterated that the US attitude towards Japan remained unchanged as a supplementary explanation. In fact, the US and British authorities have no doubt about the current Far East policy, and the world should not doubt it either. However, the fact that they have successively engaged in solemn explanations proves that the deep clouds and darkness are noteworthy, and even the US Congress has misinterpreted Roosevelt's firm and clear speech.

As pointed out in this newspaper's editorial yesterday, the attitude expressed by Roosevelt in his fireside chat on the 27th is the most active measure that a non-belligerent country can take. The reason why his condemnation of the crimes of aggression singled out the Nazis and Hitler is only because Germany is the center of gravity of the aggression front, and it is not allowed to be misinterpreted as relaxation or forgiveness for other accomplices and abettors. If Roosevelt really distinguished between the aggressor nations, then Italy should first express relief because the Fascist Party and Mussolini were not mentioned at all in that speech. And his praise for China's war effort and his promise to strengthen aid to China are enough to show his great concern for the Far East. Reducing the Far East issue to the Sino-Japanese War is not the US authorities' avoidance of stimulating Japan, but the current stage of the Far East issue is actually centered on the Sino-Japanese War. The US concern for the Far East is fundamentally defensive rather than offensive. If Japan does not intend to launch a war against the US, or cause the US to suffer a stimulus that it cannot tolerate, the US has no need to fight in the Far East. But this cannot be misinterpreted as an appeasement attempt by the US authorities, just as the US has not declared war on Germany to date cannot be misinterpreted as having illusions about Germany. Those who speculate in this way may be true believers in the appeasement policy. The additional aid to China announced by Roosevelt, if it can meet the objective needs in terms of time and the quality and quantity of equipment, may be more effective in preventing the expansion of the Far East aggression tragedy than the US's direct participation in the Pacific war. Following Hull's statement explaining that the US policy towards Japan remains unchanged, it is reported that the US military has allowed a large number of air force pilots and mechanics to come to China. Hull also stated to Guo Taiqi, the new Chinese Foreign Minister, the day before yesterday that after China's anti-Japanese reconstruction is achieved, the US will begin to unite the countries enjoying consular jurisdiction in China to abolish the last few special rights preserved in China. This indicates that the US aid to China is being expanded and implemented. On the other hand, it also shows the fundamental spirit and position of its policy towards China, which are all incompatible with the appeasement policy.

The so-called appeasement policy has created countless crimes in the international community and indirectly promoted the aggressive war that slaughters mankind and destroys civilization. However, it has not completely disappeared from the international political arena to this day, which is really strange. Perhaps this is the manifestation of human inertia! From the Allies' tolerance of Germany setting up defenses in the Rhineland to the US's recent appeasement of Vichy France, none of them have been successful, and those who have achieved success are almost non-existent. Even in terms of the past in the Far East, before the Tripartite Pact, the appeasement policy had been implemented repeatedly, but the result was only to make the international division in the Far East clearer and the aggressors' greed more rampant. Today, within Japan, there are indeed people who hope to adjust relations with democratic countries, but not to mention whether they have the ability to influence the political situation, even if they really have the possibility of breaking away from the Axis relationship, the price they demand will also be very high. Unless the United States can modify its fundamental position of maintaining justice and resisting aggression, it can be asserted that it will absolutely not be able to accept it. What's more, the radical forces within it still occupy the advantage, and the demand to adjust relations with the United States has gradually been overwhelmed by the voices loyal to the Tripartite Alliance.

Whether the situation in the Pacific will continue to deteriorate depends not only on how US-Japan relations develop but also on the future of the Sino-Japanese War and the Anglo-German War, and the comparison of US-Japan strength. To ensure the peace of the Far East, it is only possible to promote the victory of the Chinese and British war efforts and to increase the proportion of US strength. This is exactly what the US authorities are trying to do at this moment. As for all kinds of other things, they are nothing more than illusory fantasies.

### President Chiang Encourages Compatriots Across the Country to Promote the Savings and Construction Movement

Chongqing: President Chiang Kai-shek attaches great importance to the launch of the public organization Savings Practice Association by the National Savings Association. He recently sent a circular telegram commending the people for regular savings. The original telegram is as follows: The National Regular Construction Savings Committee, to all party, government, and military chiefs across the country, and to all comrades working under their jurisdiction and to compatriots across the country and overseas Chinese, for your information. Since the launch of the regular national construction savings movement, compatriots across the country and overseas Chinese have responded enthusiastically, and the total amount of savings has surged, which shows that our compatriots share the purpose of this movement and follow it enthusiastically, which is deeply gratifying. Because the savings movement, on the one hand, collects the people's financial resources, which is necessary to complete modern construction, and on the other hand, it encourages thrift and savings, which is an important plan for reviving the country and the nation. In the near term, it can supplement the supply of the front-line combat and promote the stability of the rear economy. In the long term, it can develop the resources and reserves of the country and consolidate the foundation of people's livelihood. All of these must be taken from regular savings, and they can be implemented step by step. Looking at any wartime country in the world today, the income they collect from the people is at least 50% to 60% or more, and the lives of the people they control have strict restrictions on food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Compared with our country, the difference is very large. We should know to be alert. In the future, our party, government, and military comrades, as well as compatriots across the country, should, in promoting thrift and savings, base themselves on the concept of voluntary action, regard it as a way to establish themselves, make twice the efforts, practice it faithfully, from home and abroad, from cities and villages, all those who are Chinese, regardless of old or young, male or female, should follow the instructions issued by Zhongzheng in the past, consolidate the foundation and cultivate the yuan, and do not stop for a moment, and actively participate in the Savings Practice Association, encourage each other, and persevere without changing. Turn consumption into practical use, and accumulate little by little. Considering the vast territory and large population of our country, with the concerted efforts of the masses, the results will be great, and the future of the Anti-Japanese Construction will be deeply benefited. I have high hopes for this. Zhongzheng You (26th) Shichuan, (31st dispatch)

It is reported that the Italian Minister and his entourage stationed in Baghdad have fled to Iran. After the Baghdad Mayor's organization of a four-member committee took over the administration of the city, it proposed an armistice request. According to the mayor, Regent Ilah should enter Baghdad immediately after the terms of the armistice are agreed upon to organize a constitutional government to restore peace and independence in Iraq. This is public opinion. The armistice negotiations took place all day on Friday. At that time, a military officer commanding the rebel army near Baghdad personally went to the British camp with a white flag to negotiate peace. This was the result of the Baghdad Mayor's negotiations with the British Ambassador, and the British Ambassador advised the Iraqi rebel army to open peace talks with the British Commander.

### 15,000 British Troops Evacuated from Crete, War Has Reached Final Stage, German and Italian Forces Meet on South Coast

Berlin: According to Haitong News Agency reporter's inquiry from authoritative sources, the German forces advancing from the west to the east of Crete have met with the Italian forces advancing from the east to the west. (First, Haitong News Agency)

Berlin: According to responsible sources, more than 9,000 British and Greek troops on Crete have been captured. The German army continued to advance to the south coast of the island yesterday.

The Battle of Crete can be said to be the most important battle in the Mediterranean, but the trend of the war was initially uncertain. While the German and British troops were fighting fiercely in the west of the island, the Italian army landed in the east of the island, immediately forming a new Italian-British front. After the Italian army launched a fierce battle with the British army, the brave German army advanced rapidly and occupied Candia. However, although Crete is an important stronghold in the Mediterranean, it is not our final goal, as the island is only the prelude to the great Mediterranean war. (First, United Press)

Berlin: According to official announcements here, after the important bases of the British army on Crete fell one after another, their resistance has collapsed. Small teams of enemy troops are now being chased by German troops. The German mountain troops advanced 65 kilometers in two days. It is commendable that the German paratroopers were able to maintain their position for eight days before reinforcements arrived.

### British Ships Continue Search for Prinz Eugen

London: The German ten-thousand-ton cruiser Prinz Eugen, eight days after leaving the Bismarck, is still being searched for by the British Navy. British ships and planes that pursued the Bismarck are now speeding across thousands of miles of the Atlantic Ocean to track it down. It is widely believed that this large German ship is fleeing to the Soviet port of Murmansk, or Dakar, or another port in French West Africa. (First, Reuters)

### Germany Plots to Control Eastern End of the Mediterranean, but Difficult to Achieve in the Short Term Due to Excessive Consumption of Opening Force

London: The Daily Telegraph published a special article by diplomatic reporter Lennox, stating that Germany is now concentrating its efforts to control the eastern end of the Mediterranean. They rely on the Vichy government's decision to oppose the continuation of the struggle from the vast French North African territories, so they have gained a supremely advantageous position in the center or waist, and with the help of Spain, they can achieve the same results with Gibraltar. This achievement can indeed enable Germany to control the North African coast, but the date of realization is still far away. The consumption of the German military's opening force is actually greater than generally recognized, but it is not fully consumed. According to neutral sources within Germany, this trend seems to have emerged now. Therefore, we must be able to anticipate that one day in the future, the Allied Navy and its friends and comrades will start attacking the enemy from the edge of the battlefield again. Their air force will continue to bomb the center of the violent country with bombs. Even on land, the Allied land forces may be able to contain the German advance. When the position of encircling the enemy army is created, it can be believed that the main force will be on the side of those who defend the freedom of the world. The Iraqi rebels' request for a ceasefire is of great importance, not only making it easier for Britain to restore order in that important Arab country, but also consolidating the attitude of other anti-Axis countries, and thereby making it easier to contain the Axis countries' plan to control the Near East. However, now that Germany is disappointed in Iraq, it will definitely increase its activities in the neighboring country of Iran. At the same time, the US government is still discussing with General Weygand in order to obtain a compromise and guarantee that the necessary goods will be continuously transported to North Africa, hoping to prevent the Germans from penetrating deep into North Africa. It is now believed that these talks are progressing very satisfactorily. However, according to recent news, the Vichy government has transported a large number of weapons to North Africa. I do not know if they will be used to recapture the land of Free France in West Africa and Equatorial Africa. According to recent rumors, Darlan has reached an understanding with Germany and will allow Hitler to obtain vast French colonies in Africa, including Cameroon. (First, Reuters)

### Vichy Shamelessly Serves the Enemy, US to Send Warning Note, Declaring Future US Attitude Towards France, Depends on Vichy's Actual Actions, Darlan Leaves No Stone Unturned in Slandering Britain

Washington: It was learned here yesterday that the State Department is currently drafting a formal note to Vichy, informing them that the US's future attitude will depend on Vichy's actual actions, not empty words. It was also learned that the State Department will write a transcript of Secretary of State Hull's conversation with French Ambassador to the US, Haitian Henry, regarding French-German cooperation. The note will also express pessimistic concern about the Axis countries' use of Syria, and reject France's excuses, since if Syria is a mandate territory and not a colony, the French-German armistice agreement cannot be applied to Syria. (First, United Press)

Paris: Cabinet Assistant Darlan recently gave a lengthy speech to reporters here, strongly refuting the claim by British propaganda agencies that France's ability to be saved depends on British victory, saying, "If the world today is a world of Anglo-Saxon victory, then France will only be reduced to the position of a second-class autonomous territory and will no longer be able to shoulder any glorious tasks. Moreover, if we take a passive attitude and wait for British victory, then the price to be paid will be to drive the country to complete destruction. I and Marshal Pétain are unwilling to accept this destructive policy, and the Marshal has ordered me to promote a policy of revival. Under these circumstances, it is natural that I become the target of British anger, and it is inevitable that the British authorities will re-adopt the policies they pursued in the era of the Great Revolution and Napoleon, treating France as 'the Irish of the Continent' or even an ordinary colony. However, the goal of my work is to restore France to its inherent position in Europe and the entire world. Therefore, I must participate in the construction of a new order and must try to accelerate the realization of peace, because while British imperialism needs war to destroy Europe, France needs peace to survive. In any case, I will fulfill my responsibilities. The day after the incident at the port of Sfax, what I want to say is to reiterate my determination. In other words, I will make others respect France's right to freely use its ports and transportation lines. It should be known that although France has been defeated, it will never allow others to use violence against its territory or insult its flag.

143 Ships Detained

Since the date of our country's armistice, no fewer than 143 of our country's ships have been detained by the British. The British Navy disregards international law, and when it encounters French ships, it has arbitrarily changed the right to intercept and interrogate into the right to detain them directly. Even if the intercepted ship is an empty ship, it is detained horizontally. From this, it can be seen that Britain's purpose is to implement a pirate war against us, so that the French people will starve to death on the one hand, and to replenish its increasing number of sunken merchant ships on the other. Moreover, for self-defense, Britain often falsely accuses us. One day it accuses us of supplying Germany and Italy from the sea, and the next day it accuses us of transporting military supplies. In fact, the purpose of all these violent acts is to eliminate France's shipping capacity, cut off the connection between mainland France and its colonies, and isolate us from the world. Since last June, Britain has detained a total of 82 French merchant ships, totaling 370,000 tons, taken over 10 of our ships, totaling 36,000 tons, in the colonies occupied by our country's rebels, and intercepted 33 of our ships, totaling 158,000 tons, at sea. Later, it blocked 13 of our ships in the United States, totaling 142,000 tons. Apart from this, there are still some French ships that were either bombed, torpedoed, or sunk themselves due to the threat of the central ship. The above totals no less than 792,000 tons, worth a total of 12 billion francs. This loss is even greater than the supply fees that our country has paid to the German army since the armistice. "

Recalling the Past, Being Fooled by Britain

Darlan then recounted the two decisions on the British ship attacking the ports of Oran and Dakar. He was truly saddened by the fact that the French main ship "Dunkirk" was hit by a torpedo on July 7 last year, and said, "In view of this kind of fact, I don't understand why the British government would treat its former allies like this, why it must starve French women and children, why it must destroy the material and spiritual power of France, why it supports the propaganda work of French separatists in London with huge sums of money, and why it repeatedly decides to instigate the rebellion of soldiers in French colonies. Looking back since the Great War, Britain has destroyed the peace that we had signed with Germany, and promoted Turkey to send troops to Silesia, causing disputes between that country and us. The goal of Britain's policy towards Germany was to isolate us. In 192, Britain again supplied the rebels in Morocco and Syria with money and weapons. At every international conference held over the years, Britain has always sacrificed France's interests to expand its power. In 1935, Britain encouraged France to impose sanctions on Italy. When the German army reoccupied the Rhine area, Britain did not give us the convenience to fight back on the one hand, and did everything possible to prevent us from conducting direct talks with Germany on the other. In a nutshell, looking at the Anglo-French diplomatic relations from 1919 to 1939, it can be said that every time France appealed to Britain, it was rejected, but every time Britain wanted to defend its interests, France would always willingly help it. In 1938, British Prime Minister Chamberlain was unwilling to pay attention to the Czech incident. By 1939, Britain encouraged us to intervene in the Polish incident, which is one example. From this, it can be seen that the reason why Britain constantly attacks us with cruel methods is actually in accordance with its consistent political policy. In other words, it wants to bankrupt Europe so that Britain can dispose of it at will. Only in this way, every time we decide to unify the European continent, Britain will secretly or openly attack us. Every time we decide to establish an agreement with a country, Britain and the pro-British faction in our country will oppose it in the League of Nations. It was not until Germany rose to become an important factor in unifying the European continent that Britain suddenly became loyal to its obligations to the French alliance and used our country's ignorant politicians, under the guise of justice and freedom, to drive us into war. In short, Britain's current policy is to prevent France from participating in the new European order, that is, to prevent France from maintaining its territorial integrity and unity." (31st, Havas)

### America Prepares for War: Overview of Military Aircraft Production. 500,000 Men and Women Work in Various Factories; Average Monthly Production Reaches 1,600 Aircraft

New York – The U.S. Air Force has replaced the fleet as the first line of defense in the Western Hemisphere. As such, the development of the aviation industry, in terms of the number of employees and the value of production, can rival the steel, automotive, and construction industries without falling short. By 1941, 500,000 men and women will be working in U.S. aircraft factories. The area occupied by aircraft manufacturing plants amounts to 50 million square feet, and the monthly production of military aircraft exceeds 1,600. Among the twenty major manufacturing plants, the Curtiss-Wright factory alone employs over 90,000 workers, manufacturing machines, bombers, training aircraft, and pursuit aircraft. Total orders have already exceeded 50,000 military aircraft, and within weeks, this number may increase to 65,000, necessitating the expansion of factories and the workforce. Financially, this undertaking burdens every man, woman, and child in both Britain and America with considerable expenses. In round numbers, the current unfulfilled orders amount to 50 million U.S. dollars, and this figure may increase substantially before the end of the war. In short, this represents the most rapid development of any industry in world history, proving President Roosevelt’s determination to make America the arsenal of democracy. Although America is actively participating in the war, the quality of its aircraft surpasses or equals that of any foreign aircraft. Its military aircraft have self-sealing fuel tanks and are equipped with armor plating to protect the crew. They also boast .50 caliber machine guns capable of penetrating armor, power-operated turrets, and superior firepower. Besides the Curtiss P-40, Bell P-39, Lockheed P-38 pursuit aircraft, and the Vought XF4U Corsair naval dive bomber capable of flying 400 miles per hour, American aircraft designers have also invented the long-range Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Consolidated B-24, as well as the Douglas DB-7 and A-20 attack bombers, which are the fastest and most formidable bombers in the world. The most significant achievement is the 70-ton, 8,000-horsepower Douglas B-19 bomber, capable of traversing the Atlantic Ocean without stopping. U.S. Army Air Corps Commander General Arnold recently declared that the outcome of the war would be determined by the nation that first builds a bomber fleet with a 10,000-mile range. Long-range fighters and bombers are specialties of American manufacturers. American-made clipper seaplanes, patrol bombers, and transport aircraft all hold major records for speed, range, and endurance. The aircraft industry confidently acknowledges Ford’s claim that it can produce 1,000 complex, high-speed military aircraft daily. Future production will increase dramatically, but it will not exceed 50,000 military aircraft annually by 1944. If the current number of aircraft types can be reduced to three or four, the production quantity will naturally increase significantly, but it is unlikely to be reduced to that extent. It is believed that strict standardization can reduce the number of aircraft types to forty. Thanks to modern efficiency methods, the creation of new designs has been greatly accelerated. Experts at Vultee have streamlined the technical procedures, reducing the time required to produce a new design from 24 months to 10 months. Previously, it took 15 months of testing before the government would approve a new aircraft design. Now, manufacturers only need to submit a preliminary design with engineering estimates (taking only two months), and the government will immediately authorize the construction of the first aircraft in writing. By the end of the fourth month, actual construction is underway. The current standard method of manufacturing aircraft is to produce the wings, fuselage, and other components separately and then assemble them in one factory. This allows the work to be distributed among aerospace manufacturers nationwide. Previously, the aircraft industry was concentrated on the East and West Coasts, but recently, inland cities such as St. Louis, Indianapolis, Bidetroit, Louisville, and Tulsa have also seen the establishment of large aircraft factories. Southern California has the advantage that, due to the weather, complex work can be done outdoors. As for the method of delivering aircraft ordered by foreign countries, long-range aircraft will be “flown over.” This correspondent heard at the Lockheed factory in California that Hudson bombers could fly themselves to England within a week of leaving California, but smaller aircraft such as pursuit aircraft and interceptors have limited range and must be transported by cargo ships.

The newspaper said that continuing delays in negotiations could only be regarded as indirect hostility towards Japan. The newspaper also asserted that Japan was being used as a transit base for Britain's enemies, as the transportation situation was well-known and there were other obstacles, but the main point was that Japan itself also had needs.

All export passports from the Philippines will be issued by Sayre under the direction of Maxwell on behalf of U.S. Secretary of State Hull. Maxwell also stated that export controls in the Philippines have been expanded due to Chickering's trip to the Philippines. (United Press dispatch, 1st)

Tokyo – Japan's "Jiji Shimpo" stated today that the implementation of U.S. export control regulations in the Philippines directly hinders the normal flow of commerce and urged Filipinos to make every effort to abolish the regulations. The newspaper often represents the views of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. It is claimed that the immediate impact of the export control regulations is to force the value of copra down from 11 Philippine pesos per picul to 7 Philippine pesos. The newspaper said, "Philippine markets rely on Japan. Last year, all steel and iron exported from the Philippines were shipped to Japan, and over 60 percent of steelmaking materials were shipped to Japan, while over 27 percent of Manila hemp was shipped to Japan. These items are likely to be affected by export restrictions, but those who plant copra and palm oil for export will suffer greatly. Through years of trade, Japan has established the right to obtain these products. Japan is not currently at war with the United States. Under these circumstances, prohibiting the export of these supplies is extremely infuriating. Even if the United States absorbs these products itself, it is subsidizing the Philippines with an unjust system to compensate them for refusing to trade with Japan. In short, the whole thing is wrong. It is the root cause of this war and the general unrest in the world. If the Philippines wants to continue doing business with its old customer Japan, they should not tolerate disguised blockade measures." (United Press dispatch, 1st)

### Seven U.S. Aid-China Groups Form Joint Organization. Stalled Trade Negotiations Between Japan and the Dutch East Indies Could Be a Fuse for a Pacific War. American Pilots and Mechanics Have Set Off for Chongqing.

The general situation in the Far East is still peaceful. The only disruptive factor at present is the trade negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia, which have reached a standstill. Tokyo claims that the Dutch East Indies authorities are "lacking sincerity" in conducting the negotiations, but the Dutch East Indies claims that the negotiations have stalled due to the Japanese side. Therefore, the outcome of this dispute may quietly end without resolution. However, this dispute is also a fuse for a Pacific war, so it is still impossible to predict how its future development will unfold.

American Pilots Volunteer for China

At the end of last week, a reliable source in Washington issued an important message, stating that the U.S. War Department has authorized pilots and mechanics to voluntarily resign from the Army Air Corps in order to come to China to serve. U.S. Army Department officials are unwilling to comment on this news, but according to general reports, several American pilots and mechanics have set off for China to go to Chongqing in order to fly fighter jets and transport aircraft in China. However, if American pilots and mechanics come to China but do not have aircraft to fly, they will be useless heroes. But on the other hand, now that they have come to China, there is no doubt that American aircraft, including the famous Flying Fortress, must have been or are about to be shipped to China.

Aid-China Groups Form Joint Organization

U.S. aid-China groups are expanding relief efforts and providing aid to China, and are now more enthusiastic than ever. Since President Roosevelt strongly advocated for aid to China with determination, seven other U.S. organizations, including the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, the China Emergency Relief Committee, the United China Relief, the American Committee for Chinese War Orphans, the Church Committee for China Relief, the American Committee for Industrial Cooperatives, and the United Board for Christian Colleges in China, have formed a joint organization to expand activities and fundraising, popularize the actual strength of aid to China throughout the United States, and accelerate aid to China. The joint group was initiated this past spring and officially established in April. The period of activity will last until the end of July, launching a fundraising campaign for 5 million U.S. dollars in aid-China relief funds.

Establishment Process and Organizational Overview

According to the declaration of the organizational overview of the joint organization, since July 1937, Americans have seen China fighting for independence and freedom with a firm will and excellent results, so their friendly feelings towards China have further transformed into admiration and sympathy. Secondly, the United States deeply knows that China is not only fighting for its own independence, but also the first line of defense to stop other countries from extending aggressive forces to the Western and Southern Pacific regions, so sympathy for China is self-evident.

The general American public generally believes that the United States has some shame and guilt towards China because weapons of certain aggressive countries are taken from the United States, so the aid-China sentiment is becoming increasingly high and reaching a fever pitch. In action, several aid-China groups have been established one after another. Most of the work is fundraising and donating to relieve China or support China's construction, such as medical aid to China and funding industrial cooperatives. However, they are each operating independently without a centralized organization. Now, in order to obtain contact and achieve efficiency with half the effort, the organization is named the United China Relief.

List of Personnel Responsible for the Federation

According to the Federation's declaration, the joint aid-China objective of the seven aid-China groups is that "the organization wants to use this organization to allow the seven American groups that are enthusiastic about China's relief and revival work to unite their efforts, expand activities and fundraising, spread throughout the United States, and increase the actual strength of aid to China." The Federation was established on April 1 and is scheduled to carry out large-scale and extensive fundraising activities in those four months until July 31. The purpose is to concentrate efforts and raise 5 million U.S. dollars to aid China. The selection of responsible personnel for the Federation has been decided: White Baerner (Chairman of Marine Midland Trust Company) will serve as Chairman, Vice Chairman will be Xibba Nabard (General Secretary of the YMCA), Chief Financial Officer is Gates (Chairman of New York Trust Company), and Directors are Wilkie, Breed, Hoffman, Lamont, Roos, John Rockefeller, Selsnick, Spool, and Ms. Pearl Buck. Mrs. Roosevelt is nominated as the honorary chairman of the National Advisory Committee of the Federation. In order to enable the donation disbursement to be most effectively distributed, the Board of Directors has also established a "Donation Support Committee" to study the actual needs of China's relief and revival. The Federation has full authority to provide opinions.

Expand Fundraising and Aid the Rear Area

According to the announcement of the Federation's Board of Directors, the purpose of this expanded fundraising campaign is to enable the participating groups to (1) continue and expand medical treatment assistance, (2) assist China in establishing 30,000 industrial cooperatives to revitalize the purchasing power of the Chinese people during and after the war, (3) assist Chinese colleges and universities that have withdrawn to the rear in continuing cultural and research efforts, and (4) relieve Chinese refugees who have suffered from the war. In terms of work, (1) exhibitions will be held in several important cities in the United States, displaying pictures, publications, and photos related to China's operations for people to visit, (2) celebrities who sympathize with China will be invited to give public speeches, (3) tea parties will be held, and (4) radio stations will broadcast programs on China.

### Joint Defense in May Was Successful; Vigilance Has Not Been Relaxed.

His relatives and clansmen initiated a vegetarian banquet to celebrate his birthday on the ninth day of the fifth lunar month at Xiyuan Temple on Aiwenyi Road. Here is the thank-you poem: What age is this now, how dare I celebrate? And my year is only the age of sixty, less old than in the East. The year before last was my mother's eightieth birthday, and I have not yet celebrated. I wanted to decide to return home early to entertain my mother. But the thorns cover the ground, and the merciful command is not to return home. I welcome visitors in vain, and the golden daylily loves the hometown catalpa. I lean on the dilapidated fence, and my eyes are sore and it is difficult to travel. The orphaned old Five Phoenixes, the colorful wings were broken in three lines. My knees are just weak crowns, and I hope to do a lot. Strict admonition and cautious choice, it is difficult to avoid imitating Ji Liang. My two nephews have been given a job, when will I see them soar? I think of myself as useless, and I have no length to choose talents. Therefore, I will set up a public banquet, and I will set up about three chapters. The guests are not widely distributed, and the auditorium is not covered. There are precedents for hundreds of miles, and the meal fee is limited to five sheep. Love me to leave mudprints, and the crown is collected in the movie. Take the spirit of joy, and give up the brilliance of the material. Use this to spend the first day, don’t laugh at the unprecedented. Everything can be improved, and what is the matter with the grass? Looking around at the disturbances, the wild geese need benevolent soup. Saving food to live in the world is better than birthday people. In a few years, God will add me, and the world will be righteous. My mother is ninety years old, and the conference will be drunk.

### Yesterday's Memorial Ceremony for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Burial: All Circles Increased Loyalty

Comply with the Wishes of the Deceased: Work Hard in Their Positions and Strive for Freedom and Equality for the Country and the Nation

Yesterday was the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's burial. Although all circles in Shanghai did not hold memorial ceremonies due to the special circumstances, in order to comply with the wishes of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and strive for national freedom and equality, they decided to sincerely support national policies, work hard in their positions, and complete the great cause of national rejuvenation to comfort Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven.

### Tomorrow Is Anti-Smoking Day: Promote the Anti-Drug Movement

The Poisonous Atmosphere Is Mired in Shanghai, and the Suffering of Tobacco Is Rampant. Citizens Should Know to Be Vigilant and Comply with National Policies

Tomorrow (June 3) is the memorial day for Lin Wenzhong (Xu) burning opium at Humen in Guangzhou. The National Government has stipulated that it is Anti-Smoking Day, and has ordered all localities to eliminate the scourge of tobacco within a time limit in order to revitalize the national spirit and implement the anti-smoking policy. However, the poisonous atmosphere in Shanghai is pervasive, and the suffering of tobacco is rampant, causing the wish for three years of rural tobacco and five years of drug prohibition to be shattered. Last month, the Ministry of Law re-distributed strict laws and regulations in order to make a passive resistance. On this Anti-Smoking Day, we cannot help but be deeply vigilant. Citizens are determined to abide by national policies, unanimously promote the anti-drug movement, and advise friends and relatives who are addicted to tobacco to wake up as soon as possible, make up their minds and quit immediately, so as to save expenses and restore a healthy body. If there are strong citizens, there will be a strong country. The First and Second Branch of the High Court are scheduled to burn confiscated tobacco and drug utensils tomorrow to promote it.

### Sailed into American Military Zone: Japanese Military Vehicle Intercepted, Three Pistols Found Onboard, Senior Officials From Both Sides Negotiated a Resolution

Yesterday morning, within the American military zone of the Public Concession, another incident occurred where a Japanese military vehicle carrying weapons drove through, leading to an interception by American defense forces. The situation became quite tense. Later, after Japanese officials arrived to explain the misunderstanding, the incident was resolved.

Japanese Military Vehicle Carrying Weapons

It is understood that the section of Yu Qiaqing Road west of the Public Concession is the defense area of the Fourth Marine Regiment of the US Navy. In the past, due to Japanese troops carrying weapons and entering the area without authorization, the Japanese authorities guaranteed that similar incidents would not occur again, and the matter was resolved. Unexpectedly, yesterday at approximately 8:30 AM, another Japanese military vehicle, identified as number 365, carrying a Japanese military police officer, two guards in plainclothes, and a driver, drove eastward from Shanghai West into the American defense zone of Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, American defense forces discovered that the vehicle was carrying two packages of weapons, but due to the Japanese military vehicle's rapid speed, they were unable to intercept it in time.

Chasing and Intercepting Creates Tense Situation

Subsequently, three members of the McKinley team's patrol squad urgently chased after it on three-wheeled motorcycles at high speed. They caught up with the vehicle in front of the Grand Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. The American military vehicle immediately stopped to intercept and attempted to inspect it. However, the Japanese military police officers refused to be inspected, leading to a standoff. Both sides called their respective units for assistance. Subsequently, the Japanese military police corps dispatched a vehicle with two military police officers and one military police assistant, arriving in front of the Grand Theater. After negotiations, no resolution was reached, and the standoff continued, creating a highly tense situation.

Senior Officials Negotiated at the Scene

Before long, American defense forces also dispatched a military officer and three soldiers in a vehicle. At the same time, the Public Concession Police Department received a report and dispatched a Japanese detective and other Western detectives to the scene. They confirmed that each Japanese military police officer was carrying three pistols, while the driver did not have any weapons. At that time, another Japanese vehicle carrying three plainclothes personnel (personnel from the Japanese Consulate) arrived at the scene and negotiated with the American defense forces. Subsequently, the Japanese military vehicle number 365 was allowed to return, and the American defense forces took the Japanese plainclothes personnel to the American military headquarters for a resolution. According to reports from the Social News Agency, when the American and Japanese officials arrived, they confirmed that the vehicle did indeed contain three pistols, belonging to the Japanese military police officer and two Japanese soldiers. They immediately ordered the vehicle to leave, thus ending the dispute.

### Rice Merchants Repeatedly Selling Hong Kong Rice Attempting To Smuggle It Abroad, Ordering and Sales of Tribute Rice Must Be Registered, Some Rice Merchants Are Treacherous and Should Be Severely Punished

Local foreign firms recently received a telegram from colleagues in Vietnam stating that the Vietnamese harvest season is about to begin. Due to even rainfall during the planting season, a bountiful harvest is expected. According to rice industry sources, a certain rice firm also received a telegram from Hong Kong colleagues yesterday stating that the Vietnamese government has approved large-scale shipments of high-quality tribute rice to Shanghai to alleviate shortages, now that the new harvest is about to begin. The rice merchants, upon receiving the telegram, are actively preparing to place large orders. According to shipping industry sources, there will be no shortage of vessels required to transport the tribute rice, and the shipping costs may continue to decrease. Therefore, the cost for rice merchants to purchase foreign rice will become lower.

Rice Registration to Eliminate Speculation

The authorities of the two concessions have scheduled rice stock registration to thoroughly stabilize the food supply for the population, which has received widespread praise from all sectors. It is believed that the authorities' implementation of this measure is a warning to speculators, who will no longer be able to operate freely. Yesterday, this reporter visited the official in charge and asked how the authorities would implement this measure. The official stated that the authorities deeply believe that if rice prices are not urgently suppressed, it will be difficult to ensure social order. Therefore, stabilizing the food supply is a firm resolution. Although suggestions for rice registration and other measures were made to the authorities earlier, the matter is of great importance and was delayed until now. The authorities' rice registration is an essential part of stabilizing the food supply. The efforts to improve the situation depend on the continued efforts of the rice industry associations, and the authorities will not hesitate to provide assistance. At the same time, the authorities will not be negligent in the registration of rice, and will handle it strictly.

Sales of Tribute Rice Must Be Reported

Yesterday, information was received from the rice industry that the French Concession authorities, in order to control the transportation and sales of tribute rice in the city and prevent hoarders from raising prices, have established a working committee and stipulated that all matters relating to the ordering, transportation, and sale of tribute rice in the city must be registered in advance. The rice industry states that although the sales volume and prices in the rice market are registered daily, the quantity of goods received and ordered is not yet registered. Therefore, they are awaiting formal notification from the authorities before the rice industry groups discuss how to implement the registration.

Strictly Prohibit The Transportation of Hong Kong Rice To Other Areas

The person continued that the Shanghai Municipal Council's purchase of large quantities of Yangon special small-grained rice from the Hong Kong government at any cost is not only of excellent quality, but also has a lower price than other types of rice. Therefore, citizens of all social classes are vying to purchase the rice. According to reports from the handling foreign firms, the amount of this foreign rice that has been transported to Shanghai has exceeded half of the monthly supply, and the amount sold has also far exceeded half of what has been transported to Shanghai, approximately 100,000 bags. The authorities' purchase of Hong Kong rice and its sale in Shanghai is aimed at stabilizing the food supply and helping the common people. However, some rice merchants with ulterior motives are transporting the rice to other areas for sale, making greater profits. They dare to resell Hong Kong rice on the market, attempting to transport it out. The authorities will strictly prohibit this. In the future, those who sell Hong Kong rice must accurately report the daily sales volume of Hong Kong rice to Jardine Matheson and China Merchants Steam Navigation, and must not conceal the facts to prevent corruption.

Strict Inspection of Rice Exports

Yesterday, a person familiar with the rice market told this reporter that if there were no speculation and continued hoarding by large households, the price of rice in the city would have fallen below 100 yuan. However, recently the price of rice has not only failed to decline, but has instead seen a high peak. The market situation is sometimes tight and sometimes loose, and people are still uneasy. According to what he knows, there are currently one or two rice firms attempting to hoard large quantities of spot goods in the city to transport them to Macau, Hangzhou, Fujian, Haimen, and other places for profit. Every time they are about to do business on the market, holders take the opportunity to hoard, and the prices of various types of rice not only fail to decline but are instead frequently raised. When these people apply to the authorities for removal permits, they fabricate various reasons in the hopes of gaining the authorities' trust. They then use the removal permits to transport high-quality rice to other areas by truck. Therefore, what is urgently needed to be implemented now is to limit the amount of goods that can be traded on the market each day, and the authorities should strictly inspect rice transportation.

### Business Employees Refused To Accept Dismissal Compensation

The labor unrest at the Commercial Press has been deadlocked for more than a month. The management still insists on the original plan to lay off employees, and mediation has yielded no results. It is reported that more than 600 employees have been laid off or reassigned, accounting for more than half of the total number of employees. After receiving letters from the authorities, the laid-off employees were dispersed by detectives. At that time, the police station promised to mediate and provide a response in three days, but the result was also ineffective. The Commercial Press authorities entrusted lawyer Wang Yaotang to issue six months of compensation to the dismissed employees, as well as half a month's salary for May and wages for statutory holidays from January to May. It is understood that the colleagues at the Commercial Press are still trying their best to resume work and are unwilling to accept the compensation. In recent days, a small number of colleagues went to the aforementioned location to receive half a month's salary for May but were rejected.

### Major Robbery at the Post Office, Thugs Discovered The Same Day, Chauffeur Said It Was Driven To Shikoku Road, Because It Is A Japanese Residence, It Was Not Suitable For Search, Police Station Will Conduct Investigation With Japanese Military Police

The Yu Lin West Newspaper reported that at around 9:30 yesterday morning (the 31st), a major robbery occurred in broad daylight. At the time, one Chinese and one Japanese person took a business car to the North Sichuan Road Postal Administration to rob 2.5 million yuan and escape. It is generally believed that a chauffeur, who was in the business car, has been arrested by the Public Concession Police Department, and will be transferred to the Japanese Military Police for investigation. The most surprising aspect of the case is that the robbers did not use weapons, and the post office workers and managers mistakenly believed that the robbers were post office employees, and allowed them to do whatever they wanted.

Japanese Drive Away With Ease

According to the head of the postal accounting section, Mr. Green, when the robbers appeared, the huge sum of money was divided into ten bags, and was being transported into an armored truck by four coolies, who were supervised by a postal worker. At that time, the robbers suddenly arrived in a green car with Concession license number 5152 and City license number 655. After getting out of the car, one of them (the Japanese) spoke to the postal worker in Japanese, and the postal worker thought that the Japanese was sent by the Japanese authorities to conduct investigations or searches, so he told another Chinese person to report to the writing room. At that time, the Japanese person and the Chinese person who came with him moved the huge sum of money into the car they came in, and as everyone was surprised, the Japanese person and his Chinese accomplice drove away quickly. At this point, the postal worker, coolies, and bodyguards present realized that they had been robbed, so they called the police to chase and arrest them, but the robbers had disappeared long ago.

Police Investigate and Detain the Driver

They immediately reported it to the police and the Japanese authorities. After investigation by the Hongkou police, it was discovered that the car the robbers were in belonged to the Shengda Automobile Company in Hongkou, and the driver was immediately detained. According to the driver's statement at the police station, a Japanese person and a Chinese person came to rent a car that morning and told him to drive to the post office. After the post office loaded ten bags of parcels, they asked him to drive to a house on Shikoku Road, paid the fare and left, he said. When the detective took the driver to Shikoku Road for an on-site investigation, but after arriving there, it was discovered that the house pointed to by the driver was where the Japanese military authorities lived. At this point, the detective had no right to enter, so he had to stop the investigation and transfer the entire case to the Japanese military police for handling. The driver was also handed over to the Japanese military police for questioning. Yesterday, informed sources believed that there may have been an inside line in the post office for the incident, otherwise the robbers would not have been able to rob the huge sum of money and escape so calmly.

The Thugs Claimed to be Sent by The Japanese

It is said that the stolen money was sent by the post office in Hong Kong and was intended to be used to build a new house for the Nanjing post office. Because the bank was closed on Friday, it was kept in the post office until yesterday, when it was planned to be sent to the postal savings and remittance bureau for storage. According to a post office official, the Japanese person who robbed the money claimed to the postal worker supervising the coolies that he was sent by the Japanese authorities. At the time, the Japanese person and his Chinese accomplices did not show any guns, and apparently succeeded in their plan by deceiving others, so investigators believe that the robbers may not have been armed, which is also possible.

### Major Casinos in Shanghai West Are About To Merge

The reason for the closure is said to be losses, and a new gambling den will open soon

The Continental News reported that the three major casinos in Shanghai West, the Hotel des Colonies, the Chinese General Association, and the United Overseas Chinese General Association, all closed at 3:00 AM yesterday (the 31st) in accordance with Pan Dazhi's order. However, the France and Yewen Taishang General Associations are still open as usual, and shouting and drinking continue until late at night.

Reasons for Closure

It is rumored that the three closed casinos have been moved to the Delmonde General Association, and are being renovated in the General Association, so as to merge and establish a new casino, which will open on June 2. Yesterday, rumors spread that the real reason for the closure of the above three casinos was losses, so it was decided to merge, in order to save huge expenses. It is said that one of the three casinos has lost 3 million yuan due to the sluggish gambling business, and has not paid any salaries for two months.

Establish One Gambling Den

Also, the Shanghai Times reported that, according to reliable sources, the casinos in the western district that have been ordered to close have decided to establish a new casino in Taiwan, named "Kowloon General Association". The investors have agreed to the gambling den. The address of the new casino is at 452 Haig Road, and it will open on Monday. This address was originally the site of the Delmonde Nightclub, which is temporarily closed for internal renovation.

Regain Momentum

Also, the English Da Mei Evening News reported that it is said that many small gambling dens in Shanghai West, which have been closed this morning (1st), will not reopen. However, the three major casinos hope to merge and regain momentum, but in order to avoid attention, they may change to entering and exiting through the back door.

### Left Foot Injured By Explosion

At around 2:00 PM yesterday, Li Yigui, a 27-year-old fisherman from Yangzhou, was fishing on the shore of the Jiang Zhao Family Residence opposite the Gaochang Temple in Nanshi. He discovered a hand-pulled grenade left on the shore. Because he did not know it was an explosive, he kicked it with his foot. The grenade exploded immediately, injuring Li's right foot. He was then transported to Bao Jiang Hospital for treatment by hired vehicle.

### Japanese Authorities Arrest Japanese Gamblers In Nanshi Casinos

The Japanese Consulate Police Department dispatched officers to the Xiyuan, Huamin, Dasheng, Tongqing on Zhonghua Road, and Lvbao, Yongan, and other gambling dens on Luxiangyuan Road in Nanshi at around 11:00 AM the other day, and arrested more than a dozen Japanese men and women who were gambling there. They were escorted to the Japanese police station. It is reported that Kim Jae-nam, a Taiwanese, and his wife, Matsuo Kimiko, have repeatedly committed gambling crimes and have been arrested several times. They have now been arrested again and will be escorted back to their home country.

### American Refugee Hospital Makes Full Use of American Wheat to Produce Various Nutritious Foods for the Poor and Sick, Uses Wheat Bags to Sew Clothes and Bedding for Distribution, Established Four Years Ago, Benefiting More Than 15,000 People

The American Refugee Hospital on Whitelee Avenue (located in the First People's Hospital) opened on December 1, 1937, to assist in caring for more than 200,000 refugees in various refugee camps in Shanghai at that time, benefiting the poor and sick. It has been nearly four years since then, and it still provides meals for 500 people every day. According to Dr. MacCraiggen, the hospital director, of these 500 people, 268 are patients, and the rest are hospital staff.

American Red Cross Provides Rice And Wheat

Most of the food distributed by the hospital is provided by the Shanghai Committee of the American Red Cross. The activities of the American Red Cross in transporting broken wheat and rice to Shanghai for disaster relief have been repeatedly recorded. The Shanghai Committee of the Association announced last week that broken wheat will be transported in thicker bags in the future, as the poor can use these bags to sew clothes. The clothes of the children in the hospital and the hired workers are made of wheat bags, and the sheets and other items needed in the hospital are also made of wheat bags.

Remarkable Results in Infant Care

Chinese medical professionals know that wheat is a very nutritious food and is preferred by those who are accustomed to eating rice. The food provided by the American Refugee Hospital is a mixture of rice and wheat, and its nutritional value is superior to that of rice alone. Every Saturday morning, the hospital holds infant care sessions, and women bring their babies to the hospital. The hospital weighs, bathes, and treats the babies one by one. Before leaving, they are given soy milk powder and wheat to improve the health and weight of the babies. The soy milk powder is made by hospital workers grinding soybeans and water, adding other nutrients, and then drying them into powder.

15,000 People Completely Free of Charge

In April, the hospital treated a total of 731 patients. In total, the hospital has treated a total of 16,573 patients since its opening, of which 15,635 were completely free of charge. Patients were hospitalized for a total of 324,870 days, of which 311,611 days were free of charge. A total of 2,969 operations were performed. In addition to general medical work, the hospital also has specialists in charge of ENT, ophthalmology, dermatology, obstetrics, and gynecology. The hospital has two floors for wards and patient facilities, and the upper two floors are for laboratories and dormitories. The hospital is well-equipped, and although its work is inevitably restricted by equipment and finances, it has done a great deal to benefit the citizens.

### Thugs Rob Military Vehicle

At 9:15 last night, someone called the Jiaozhou Road branch of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company in Shanghai West to hire a car, and asked it to drive to the Yuan Yuan Lou restaurant in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu. After receiving the call, the company immediately sent driver Shi Asan, 28 years old, in car number 18444. After arriving there, two men got into the car and asked the driver to drive to Lane 174, Whitelee Avenue. When the car drove to the entrance of the lane, they ordered the driver to stop. One man immediately took out a pistol and forced Shi Asan out of the car, and drove him to the wasteland behind Lane 174. The man with the gun watched him and forbade him to make any noise. The car was driven away by another man, and its whereabouts are unknown. More than twenty minutes later, the man with the gun also left. Shi Asan was then able to regain his freedom and reported to the police station. At 10:10, the car was still found near Lane 174. The reason for the two men robbing the car is temporarily unknown.

### Recent Developments in Chinese Stock Market

— Wang Yutong

The development of modern industry relies heavily on the adjustment of finance. Finance is to industry what blood is to the human body. Without the circulation of blood, the body will decay. Conversely, if finance is not supported by industry, it is like blood leaving the body, unable to exert and display its valuable functions. Therefore, blood and body are inseparable. In today's economically developed countries, the capital market and the financial market must advance side by side and develop together. The financial market focuses on the acceptance and discounting of bills, which is short-term finance. The capital market focuses on the underwriting and trading of securities, which is long-term finance. If the two can circulate flexibly and adjust appropriately, so that domestic idle funds have legitimate avenues for investment, and industrial and commercial enterprises can benefit from flexible and convenient funding, the contribution to the growth of the national economy will be significant. In the past, there was no trading market for Chinese company securities, making it difficult for company stocks to circulate. Investors also worried about the stagnation of funds, leading to hesitation and difficulty in raising capital. As a result, production enterprises were confined to one area, and social idle funds flowed into speculation, which harmed finance. This is why commentators today say that promoting the capital market cannot be delayed. In the past, the selling targets of China's securities market were mostly government bonds, while the stock or bond securities market of corporate enterprises had few transactions. Therefore, in the future, we must wait for the completion of our entire financial structure, such as (1) the formation of the financial system and the establishment of a bank specialization system, (2) the enrichment of the financial market, (3) the unification of paper currency issuance and the exertion of central bank functions, (4) the concentration of national capital and the bank merger movement, (5) the prosperity of industrial and commercial enterprises and the implementation of low-interest policies. After the completion of these organizations, special banks should lead the financial community in establishing a real estate securities market, so that the already issued stocks and corporate bonds of corporate enterprises can be traded and circulated in the market, and also to assist in the creation and development of new enterprises, underwriting or selling corporate stocks or corporate bonds, so that the newly issued securities are easy to sell, and the new enterprises can easily obtain the necessary funds. This is of great importance to the future of our country's industry.

Recently, speculative markets such as Shanghai foreign stocks, yarn, flowers, and gold have been plagued by repeated turmoil. The Chinese people are unaware and misled by rumors, causing countless people to become trapped and lose money. People with insight have risen to advocate and promote the Chinese stock business, hoping to gradually guide the idle funds gathered in Shanghai into the right track, and also to help the prosperity of the business community. Therefore, the Chinese stock operators have jointly organized a public trading market, publishing daily market prices. The trading methods are slightly similar to foreign stock trading. Among them, the most common trading companies are: Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Jin City Bank, Zhongyi Trust Company, Tongyi Trust Company, China Electric, Zhabei Water and Electricity, Xin Xin Company, Da Xin Company, Wing On Company, Sincere Company, Wing On Yarn Factory, Da Sheng Yarn Factory, Xin Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, Family Industry Society, Sino-French Oil Factory, Nanyang Tobacco, Da Zhonghua Match, Huacheng Tobacco, Commercial Press, China Bookstore, Kang Yuan Canning Factory, Guanshengyuan, Merlin Food Company, etc. The above companies are listed in a simplified table below:

(Note) The above table is based on China Stock Company Reports and recent surveys, × is Hong Kong dollars, Pu is ordinary stock, and Xian is preferred stock

The stocks of the above companies are only excerpts of the most frequently seen companies that trade on the current market. For example, (1) the commercial bank stocks of Shanghai, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, Jin City, Zhongyi Trust, etc. are all due to their own business expansion, solid foundation, and other factors. Moreover, Tongyi Trust has been restructured and resumed operations since February of the 27th year of the Republic of China, with a capital of 1.36 million yuan. At the same time, interest-free bonds of 1,187,945 yuan were issued. In terms of dividends, a 3% weekly interest rate was guaranteed from the 27th year, limited to two years. Although the rate was abolished to 1% in the 29th year, the principal of interest-free bonds began to be repaid by 1% at the same time, which is enough to show that its business has gradually entered the right track. (2) Yong'an, Sincere, Da Xin, and other department stores have made considerable progress. As for Xinxin Company, its total capital is 3.52 million yuan in national currency. Among them, the 320,000 yuan of preferred shares should enjoy a profit of only five years, which has expired. The company's 15th annual general meeting of shareholders resolved that all dividends should be changed to a weekly interest rate of 8%. Therefore, the dividend for the 29th year has been paid at 8%. In terms of its business, since the expansion of the new shopping mall last year, the results have been improving day by day. Other affiliated businesses, such as the establishment of the Xindu Hotel, the Green Reality Theater, and the Xin Xin Barber Shop, have also been progressing smoothly. (3) The market price of new pharmaceutical companies such as Wuzhou Pharmacy's stock has exceeded the face value by more than one time. Xin Asia, Xinyi, and Zhongqu factories not only have generous dividends, but also increase capital and expand every year. For example, Xin Asia's official interest and bonus interest reached more than 30% last year. Zhongfa Pharmacy implemented an increase in capital in the 28th year due to the establishment of the Sino-French Serum Factory, the Sino-French Oil Factory, and the expansion of its own business. The dividend and increased capital donation for the 28th year totaled more than 50%. (4) Tobacco companies such as Nanyang Brothers and Huacheng are all leaders in the industry. Nanyang Brothers added two branches in Hong Kong and Chongqing after the war, and the business was very prosperous. It is reported that the company's inventory of raw materials is sufficient for at least two years, and there is no need to seek external sources. In addition, the company also has a large foreign exchange fund, and the future of the business is unlimited. A dividend of one yuan was pre-paid in the 28th year, and two yuan was pre-paid in the 29th year. (5) The dividends and bonuses issued by other food companies such as Guanshengyuan, Merlin, and Taikang are also quite generous, and they are all increasing capital and expanding.

The above is just a brief introduction to the contents of each company, in order to glimpse the recent developments of the Chinese stock market. It is hoped that people with intentions will jointly promote it, so that finance and production business can be integrated into one, so that one day it will not only add a different color to China's financial industry, but also be celebrated for the future of the industry.

### On Today's Labor Issues (Part 2)

— Hu Xishan

Wage Issues

Humans must have living expenses in order to survive; laborers rely on their wage income to maintain their lives. In other words, laborers use wages to obtain the necessities of life in order to continue their labor force. However, in fact, the average wage that Chinese laborers can obtain is only enough to support their minimum living expenses, and within a certain period of time, the wage amount is mostly fixed and does not increase. However, the cost of maintaining life is constantly changing with the market price. Since the war, prices in various places have been rising. For example, the indices of the five most closely related necessities of life for workers in Shanghai are all rising, such as the food item. The index in the 25th year was 117.450, and it increased to 815.0 in April of the 30th year; for the fuel item, the index in the 25th year of the Republic of China was 190.33, and it increased to 759.54 in April of the 30th year. Under the circumstances of rising prices and the decline in the purchasing power of currency, workers must feel endless pain, making life difficult to stabilize and affecting work efficiency. The only way to save it is to increase wages. However, should wages be increased according to the rise and fall of the cost of living index, or according to the actual situation? In fact, the cost of living index continues to rise, and even if it is increased according to the rate, it is still not enough to catch up with the reality; the result may not be effective. Now, the method of living allowances is mostly adopted, and the standard of allowances is set according to local prices and the living conditions of the workers. However, this basic standard should still be based on the cost of living index.

Working Hours Issue

In today's resistance construction, should the working hours of laborers be extended in order to adapt to the huge need for materials and to seek an increase in production? It is also an issue that should be researched and opened. In peacetime, the general view is that the working hours of workers should be standardized at eight hours per day; this kind of proposition belongs to a social purpose that emphasizes human rights. The existence of this proposition does have its actual theoretical basis, but during wartime, extending the working hours in order to increase the amount of production cannot be said to be a neglect of human rights of society; the argument between the issue of wartime working hours and social purpose is completely consistent in principle. The reason for requesting a reduction in working hours in peacetime is nothing more than to prevent the exploitation of laborers by capitalists. In today's wartime, this phenomenon does not exist due to the power of the government. To put it bluntly, the wartime labor hour issue is no longer a social purpose-based issue, but a condition that should be suitable for economic purposes. According to the purpose of economy, in order to increase the amount of production, it is necessary to increase labor hours; however, we cannot absolutely extend the working hours of laborers: the premise is still to seek that the labor of workers is not wasted during working hours, because the labor of each worker is limited, and excessive labor will inevitably lead to fatigue and affect work efficiency; therefore, in the process of extending labor hours, the degree of fatigue should also be considered; the best is to use action analysis and time analysis, so that the labor spent in work can be correct and the efficiency can be improved.

Implementing an Excellent Worker Guidance System

The lack of skills or non-serious work of workers can be said to be the most significant problem of labor. In any industry, the excellence of the quality of production and the excellence of work efficiency are directly related to machinery and raw materials; and the quality of workers' work is no less important than machinery and raw materials. Modern industrial techniques not only rely on the good of machinery and raw materials, but also on the specialization of workers' skills. However, factories often lack good management personnel, resulting in a lack of excellent technical workers. In the current situation in our country, in order to save the time of training workers and reduce the cost of employing management personnel, and to achieve the excellence of products and the enhancement of efficiency, an excellent worker guidance system can be adopted. This system is to select ten or so workers with relatively pure technology in the whole field, and designate them as the basic excellent workers of the whole factory; during work, these excellent workers will also guide and correct other workers with inferior work skills at any time. After work, their duties are to train other workers. In order to facilitate the implementation of this system, they can be divided into groups and arranged according to grades; for example, each excellent worker is required to guide ten or fifteen people, and a most excellent worker can be set up above every ten or fifteen excellent workers to guide the basic excellent workers; from this, they can reach the factory technician or factory director according to grades. This kind of militarized organization can not only promote work efficiency, but also meet the requirements of wartime organization. (To be continued in issue 371)

### Centralized Clearing System

— Qiao

The so-called "clearing system" is actually a monetary form of barter. The contracting parties conduct trade in accordance with the agreement; there is no need to pay in cash, but only to calculate on the books. This is an economic dictatorship that forcibly maintains the balance of international payments. Originating in Germany, it was initially limited to "clearing agreements" established bilaterally between countries, and has now evolved into a "multilateral clearing system." The "multilateral clearing system" began after the establishment of the German-Italian Agreement in September 1940. According to the agreement, all receipts and payments from Italy to German-occupied areas were handled by the German clearing fund; and clearing between the occupied areas could also be carried out through the fund. This "German Clearing Fund" thus became the representative of all external claims and debts of the German-occupied areas. Therefore, Belgium could use its claims against the Netherlands to offset its debts to Norway on the fund's books. Similarly, Italy could also use its claims against Party A to offset its debts to Party B. Thus, the three or four clearing balance accounts that often occurred under the past "clearing system" have now become only one balance, which is much simpler to handle than before.

This "centralized clearing system" also has one advantage, which is that it allows exporters to quickly recover export payments. Under the old "clearing system," it was often very difficult for exporters to quickly recover their export prices if the central bank's clearing account did not have sufficient funds. Because the counterparty, regardless of the general state and seasonal situation of its trade, when it had a substantial clearing surplus claim on the other party in the case of exports exceeding imports, would not allow the new payment from the other party to be paid immediately. Therefore, the other party's exporters would have to wait for a considerable period. However, under this new system of "centralized clearing," the trade difference between Countries A and B can be offset by the difference with Country C. The rigidity of the past is likely to be eliminated under this flexibility.

This kind of "centralized clearing system" is more flexible the more countries participate; because the more complex the economic structure and supply and demand types of the countries involved, the greater the possibility of mutual offsets; this is obvious.

However, to ensure the solvency of this "centralized clearing system," the prerequisite is a central currency that can serve as the standard for the currency value of other related countries. And this central currency is actually the mother of the monetary systems of all related countries. In other words, the country that owns this central currency actually owns the monetary suzerainty of other related countries. To put it more clearly, it is the leader of this currency group, and all the monetary systems and even the countries and nations participating in this group are just its vassals. Only in this way can Germany create this system, which is naturally limited to countries occupied or controlled by it, and only to the extent that its position of occupation and control remains unshaken. Therefore, it is not surprising that so many European countries participated in this "centralized clearing system" by the end of 1940, as shown in the following table.

### ### High Prices for Decoration Materials, Tobacco Market Facing Prosperity

Tobacco market situation: Purchase prices have been gradually tightening for days, mainly because the factory's decoration materials have been rising continuously, so wooden boxes have been cancelled and replaced with paper boxes. Old wooden boxes on the market are in high demand, and hoarding households are selling less and less, all showing a wait-and-see attitude, which makes the market atmosphere gradually improve. Yesterday's market opened at 686 yuan for Five Flowers brand, and various parties had strong appetites. Later, it rose to 690 yuan. The British brand was 1,301 yuan, the Pinhai brand was 872 yuan, the Old Knife brand was 942 yuan, the Little Fairy brand was 675 yuan, 50-cigarette Qianmen were 385 yuan per 10,000, and 50-cigarette British brands were 300 yuan per 10,000. The market is unanimously prosperous, and as a result, paper boxes are still neither glorious nor disgraceful.

### ### Quanzhou Longan Has a Poor Harvest

Ordinary large-sized longan, mostly produced in Quanzhou. Last year's production was average, but due to inconvenient transportation to sales areas this spring, sales were sluggish, resulting in a gradual decline in market prices. According to recent letters from the new longan seedling customers, the shortage has already become apparent due to the inability to transport fertilizer for application, with only 10% expected. If autumn sales become active, the market outlook is expected to improve.

### ### Peanuts (1)

— Gao Jiannong

The New World not only provides us with the wonderful "food of the gods"—the cocoa tree—, allowing us to taste the food enjoyed by the gods; it also bestows upon us this sweet "longevity" fruit—the peanut—, hoping that we can maintain eternal life! The price of the tree of the gods is high. Nowadays, in China, only a small number of people in big cities can have the happiness of personally experiencing its grace. However, peanuts are humble and unassuming, and since the 17th century AD, they have already graced our China, and have become intimate friends with any villager in our remote countryside! Therefore, our relationship with it is particularly close.

The Latin name of peanuts is Arachis hypogaea. The Chinese names also include groundnut, peanut, etc., and the most elegant name is of course Longevity Fruit. Its homeland is also in South America in the New World, and what is most surprising is that its relationship with sweet potatoes and potatoes is also that of twin brothers! One originally lived in Brazil and was relatively large and stout, with the shell usually containing only two long, oval peanut kernels; the other's sphere of influence was in Peru, and was more slender and thin, with the shell containing two to four almost perfectly round peanut kernels. Before Columbus discovered the New World, the two had already parted ways, each seeking development; so to ask whether their native land is actually in Brazil or Peru? This is another mystery that no one has been able to reveal yet!

Nature has decided that those with extraordinary talents and abilities like the peanut brothers should not be confined to obscurity among the indigenous Indians, but should come out to help the world and benefit the people of the world. Therefore, after the opening of the New World, they, like other precious plants, rose to prominence in succession. The one living in Brazil was hired by the Portuguese and moved to West Africa across the stormy waves, from which their descendants multiplied and gradually expanded their influence to the Gulf of Guinea and East Africa. The one living in Peru, however, responded to the invitation of the Spaniards and bravely settled in the Philippine Islands and the Moluccas, and also developed outward from these two centers, eventually traversing various islands and countries in the Pacific Ocean. As for the spread of peanuts to Central America, Mexico, and North America, it was also a tacit agreement between the Portuguese and the Spanish, who invaded from the east and west.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### Discussions on Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Yu Yi, from the Netherlands

The sample trade fairs held in the European business world in the West every spring often lead to the upward development of relevant industries. Considering the high cost and shortage of foreign goods, which can greatly affect people's livelihoods, there is universal concern. Since ancient times, no outstanding heroes have not been inspired by changes in circumstances to achieve amazing feats, which is the ancient saying that "times create heroes." For example, those who make new contributions to poverty alleviation and medical treatment, and those who benefit the people and enrich the country through chemistry, have merits equal to good ministers and virtues comparable to good doctors. Application should not be limited to one path, and success should not be confined to one pattern. We should not only focus on producing Western medicines and supplements, but miss the great opportunity that is hard to come by in a hundred years. I will now describe six precious items from the "Utrecht Trade Fair" on its 25th anniversary to assist those who select the best from abroad with the ability to infer three things from one.

(1) Silk Without Silkworms: Nordic wood is transformed into semi-finished fiberboard, imported into the Netherlands, and transformed into "viscose" through several chemical actions. After filtering, it is passed through small holes to become silk, including machine-spun silk and two types of rayon, glossy and matte.

(2) Wool Without Sheep: The method is to extract casein from milk to fill the raw material of artificial wool.

(3) Cream Without Cows: A new product from Jurgenus coffee substitute factory, "Vitamin-enriched Dessert Cream," is poured into a coffee cup to replace delicious cream. Each contains 500 international units, or 25 milligrams of vitamin C, which is beneficial for health.

(4) Egg Yolk Without Chickens: The meat juice substitute produced by Gebe factory in Hantang City is not made by simmering meat chunks, but by extracting vegetable oil and soybean oil containing egg yolk protein. The fat content is not low, containing both soybean egg yolk protein and vitamins A and D, which are soluble in oil.

(5) Iron Without Smelting: A new method enables wood to be soaked and pressed with artificial resin, making it as hard as iron, which can be used to make household tools such as axes.

(6) Small Battery Emits Light from the Pocket: The latest product from the famous Dutch factory Airmaster, a Bijou lamp as small as a watch, is a pocket flashlight that can be stuffed into a waistcoat pocket. If you carry this item while "traveling" in remote rural areas, it is highly valuable, surpassing all other precious ornaments.

### Summer Clothing, Food, and Health

— Qiu Lang

Time flies like flowing water, and in the blink of an eye, summer has begun. Summer is what people hate and fear. The heat and humidity make people sweat profusely, and its atmosphere is extremely unpleasant. If we do not pay attention to hygiene and protection during this period, it is easy to brew diseases! Therefore, the authorities of the two concessions have recently been actively promoting epidemic prevention movements, providing free vaccinations for citizens, and notifying restaurants to switch from cold dishes to hot dishes from June 1. These are all the best policies to prevent problems before they occur. I will now briefly record one or two points on clothing and food hygiene in summer for readers.

In summer, it is appropriate to wear light clothing to keep cool, which is right; but some people, especially laborers, when they feel hot, are unwilling to wear even a undershirt, leaving themselves bare-chested—that is, half-naked. This is not only unaesthetic, but also very unhygienic, because being bare-chested makes it easiest for poisonous mosquitoes to suck blood, causing lumps to appear on the skin, or if touching sharp objects, the skin breaks and easily becomes ulcerated! Therefore, no matter how high the temperature is, a protective undershirt must be worn! In addition, one must bathe diligently in the morning and evening, and wash and change clothes often. This maintains the cleanliness of the body on the one hand, and prevents clothes from becoming moldy from prolonged sweat stains on the other hand, making them durable. Also, when sleeping at night, one must not be greedy for coolness, and a thin quilt or blanket cannot be omitted.

"Disease enters through the mouth" is a maxim, so people should pay attention to their diet, especially in the summer season, when they should be particularly careful! For example, raw and cold foods and unripe fruits should generally be eaten sparingly. Other dishes should also be mostly vegetables and less meat. Also, leftover food and dishes from the previous day in summer are very easy to spoil. It is better to sacrifice them and not eat them. But in order to cherish food and be unwilling to discard it, you can re-boil the excess food in the pot at night, cover it well, and place it in a cool place, which can prevent spoilage.

The above is old news, but being able to do so can avoid many diseases.

### Soy Sauce Mold Problem

— Xin

The plum rain season is coming, and soy sauce in everyone's kitchen is prone to mold, which is a big problem. Because moldy soy sauce is not only very unhygienic, but also spoils the taste of the soy sauce, so housewives often want to know how to prevent soy sauce from molding.

I met Mr. Xu Zhuodai the other day, and I asked him about this problem. He said, "Our Good Wife brand soy sauce will absolutely not mold, because it is disinfected before being bottled." He also said that soy sauce that is not disinfected is not guaranteed not to mold in hot weather. If raw water is mixed into the soy sauce, or if water stains on the utensils are carried into the soy sauce, it can cause the soy sauce to mold quickly.

Ordinary soy sauce merchants who do not disinfect, in order to prevent mold, generally use the following methods: (1) Using salicylic acid as a preservative, which has been discussed by someone in this column, is prone to stomach diseases and is not appropriate. (2) Using other harmless preservatives, although there are many types, the prices are very high, and it may not be cost-effective. (3) When bottling, add some salt to the hair, but it is often not easy to dissolve, and salt particles can still be found at the bottom of the hair after the soy sauce is used up, so the effect will certainly not be great. If it is completely dissolved, the salty taste is too strong, and it is easy to reduce the umami, which is not a good method either.

In short, it is best to disinfect, but recently fuel has been expensive, and many soy sauce merchants who are very calculating often refuse to do this conscientious work.

### Random Notes on Country Life

— Ziwei

Outside Fengmen, Suzhou City, nine miles by water, the town is named Zhouzhuang, the former residence of the virtuous Mr. Lu Guimeng. When Lu died, people gave him the posthumous title Mr. Fulishan. The land is passed down by people, and it has been named after him to this day. It is close to Kunshan. Zhouzhuang is a joint border between Suzhou and Kunshan, separated by a river. The Wusong River runs through it, and it is actually an important passage for the Beijing-Shanghai waterway.

Before the Tang Dynasty sculptures in Baosheng Temple underwent changes, the current sages advocated that specialists be in charge of preservation, which was widely publicized and praised as the essence of our country's art. I came late and was unable to see the true face of Mount Lu, which I regret, because troops are stationed here. Although the old objects are safe and sound today, only insiders can explore them.

The entire town is surrounded by water. There are bridges to the east, west, and south, but the north is lacking. There are eight classes that cannot be reached without a boat. Is it because it did not suffer from war before the westward march of the war?

The town has more than 3,000 residents. Before the war, there were street lights and telephones. Each station was equipped with electric fences and reinforced concrete watchtowers, providing a high-altitude view and a clear overview. Transportation included "Suzhou-Zhouzhuang" and "Kunshan-Zhouzhuang" direct bus lines, which were still relatively convenient for traffic between cities and towns.

The soil here is fertile and production is abundant. In addition to grains, aquatic products are the first-class specialty. The rent collection has been badly damaged for many years, and the farmers are all looking at each other. However, the people are fond of gambling, and countless people have lost their families. And the ground is full of robbers, and even the cautious cannot sleep peacefully. The townspeople are well-fed all day long and have nothing to do, all taking sparrow battles as entertainment. The stakes are quite large, often hundreds of dollars, so the gambling style is very strong. The martial arts bureau has several tables, and hundreds of people rely on it for a living. The leaders are wealthy, with wives and concubines filling the rooms, and servants filling the courtyards, with extravagance comparable to that of dukes.

### Experiences in Thrift

— Meizi

Recently, the most severe price increase has been in coal briquettes, which have jumped from ten yuan to about double that, which is a cause for concern for everyone, because a family can hardly do without using coal every day, so we should try our best to save coal. I have now changed to cooking lunch only once a day, cooking extra rice, and eating the leftover rice from lunch for dinner with hot water. This can reduce the coal used for cooking a meal. Side dishes are also cooked only once a day. Buy some pancakes for breakfast, which does not require any coal at all. Changed to washing my face with cold water in the morning to avoid having to light a fire in the morning. In the first few days of implementation, it was indeed a bit uncomfortable, but now I'm used to it. I heard that washing my face with cold water is very beneficial for the skin, so I decided to implement it. In this way, the coal briquette stove, which used to be lit from morning to night, is now lit only once at noon, saving about six-tenths of the amount of coal used, which is indeed a small help in reducing the burden. I think this method can be imitated by general economic families.

### Recommending a Family Publication That Meets Needs

— Sire

Recently, after reading the third volume of the first issue of the Healthy Family Monthly, I am very pleased with the richness of its content and the sharpness of its arguments. On the vertical level, it has analyzed the complex and interconnected love between three generations of grandparents, parents, and children. On the horizontal level, it has explained how to maintain the emotions between husband and wife and maintain the happiness of the family forever. In the spiritual aspect, it has pointed out the benefits and harms; in the material aspect, it has also told the key to success or failure. Pan Yang'an's "Eternal Regret for the Passionate Since Ancient Times" in this issue points out the characteristics of love based on biological and psychological theories, and declares that being passionate is not necessarily beneficial. The writing is light and the argument is sharp, which can serve as a head-on blow for young men and women.

"Taboos" in our society have existed for a long time. Those with a little common sense know that their measures are meaningless, but bad habits are hard to change, often causing those who are interested to sigh three times! This article is written by Mr. Hu Shanyuan, using extremely simple common sense to refute the absurdity of "taboos." If there are those who have them, change them; if there are none, encourage them. It is very beneficial for saving time, energy, and money!

Parents' love for their children is originally a natural instinct, and no one can say it is inappropriate, but if love is excessive and violates the facts, then love is enough to harm them. Past facts and current examples are clearly verifiable and frequently seen. In this issue, there is a story called "Little Jin's Story," which is aimed at spoiling. It is hoped that interested parents can add flavor!

In addition to the above articles, others such as "My Family's Economic Management Method" comprehensively consider both increasing income and reducing expenditure in extraordinary times, "Lullaby for a Wet Nurse" depicts the strange tales in turbulent times, and "Twilight Cries" narrates the remaining poison of feudal families are all very relevant to the times and meet needs.

### Recipes for the Week by Cai, the Star of the Family

There are many kinds of fish on the market. When housewives go to the market to buy, they either嫌其價昂嫌其多刺嫌其價昂嫌其價昂嫌其價昂嫌其價昂嫌其價昂

they either dislike the high price or the many bones, and cannot decide what kind of fish to buy for a while. Recently, the fish that are relatively cheap and have fewer bones are pomfret, which costs about ten cents per ounce. The most common way to cook them is braising. If you are tired of braising, you can try something new by braising them with tomato sauce and adding some chopped onions, which has a unique flavor. Or, you can steam them with mushrooms and ham slices and eat them with spicy soy sauce, which is also very delicious.

Spring and Autumn

### After All, Only a High School Graduate

— Qi Ming

After graduating, I obeyed my mother's order to visit my maternal uncle, asking him for a position in his bank. Previously, my mother had said to me, "Your father, when he was alive, did many favors for your uncle. This time, he will definitely grant your request." So, I changed into a newly washed blue cloth long gown and a pair of new cloth shoes.

When I arrived at my uncle's place, I told the doorman that the manager was my uncle, but he looked at my blue cloth gown, cloth shoes, and empty hands with a surprised expression, as if he didn't believe I was the manager's nephew. After I repeatedly explained, he finally allowed me to enter. Coincidentally, my uncle had guests, so I had to wait outside the office door again.

After waiting for a long time, the guests left. I walked into my uncle's office nervously and saw many gifts placed on the table. I thought they were probably left by the guest just now.

Strangely, my uncle, like the doorman, stared at my blue cloth gown, cloth shoes, and empty hands. A woman I didn't recognize asked, "Who is he?"

My uncle stammered, "He... I almost didn't recognize him. He is..." But he didn't say that I was his nephew, as if afraid I would make him lose face. The woman was also quite clever and didn't press the matter. Her cunning eyes moved to my body, making me very uneasy.

My uncle frowned and told me not to state my purpose, as he apparently knew it already. Then he said, "You're just a high school graduate?" "Yes, just a high school graduate."

Then my uncle shook his head and said, "Difficult. What can a high school graduate do? I never expected my uncle to say these words, and I was very ashamed and couldn't answer.

My uncle pointed to the woman next to him and continued, "This Miss is a graduate of University, and she's only working as a secretary here!" Obviously, my uncle was using her to humiliate me, so she laughed snidely with a tone of contempt.

I had to blush and swallow my anger, and then I excused myself.

As I was leaving, my uncle reluctantly added, "Difficult! If there's a position, I'll notify you within three days." It was as if he was warning me not to step into his noble office again.

As I walked out of the office door, I heard my uncle say, "Ha! Ha! This kid actually thinks..." followed by the female secretary's snickering laughter.

I never dreamed there would be such a result. My uncle didn't even mention my father's name. After returning home, I didn't have the courage to tell my mother what happened today. I only said that my uncle told me to wait three more days.

My mother was desperately hoping that I would find a position within three days. She said, "Your academic performance is good. This time, you will definitely be valued by your uncle..." Then she broke into a smile.

One day, two days, three days passed, with no news at all. This was what I had expected. My mother was anxiously waiting. On the evening of the third day, she went to look for my uncle herself. I advised her not to go, but she refused to listen to me.

It was late at night when my mother returned. From her red eyes, I knew that she must have been insulted by my uncle just like me. She told me again in tears that my uncle said I was a bit foolish, an idiot. At this moment, I felt a pang of heartache, but I never understood my uncle's criticism of me as "foolish" and "idiot". Was it because he was afraid I would expose his relationship with the secretary that he gave me this terrible label?

### Received Relief Funds

— Xin Meng

—Sharing a Boat Together, Relieving School Employees—

The long-rumored 800,000 yuan relief fund has now come to light. Teachers in various schools who applied to the authorities have probably received some. The situation dates back to the winter vacation at the end of last year, when the central government, out of concern for the difficult living conditions of teachers in Shanghai, began an investigation and soon approved a sum of 800,000 yuan to provide relief to all teachers in Shanghai.

From then on, all the teachers in Shanghai stretched their necks, expecting the 800,000 yuan relief fund to be distributed as soon as possible. Indeed, in today's high prices, teachers have become virtually unable to live. After receiving this news, they naturally eagerly looked forward to receiving the relief fund as soon as possible!

However, after that, there was no news at all, for more than four months, there was no information. Of course, the teachers slowly began to feel disappointed, and in these four months, at first, things were still fine, but later everyone became suspicious. Coupled with constant rumors, was the money used up in the middle? Only a portion of schools were rescued, and most schools didn't get a share? Everyone had different opinions and there was no consensus. There were even leaflets advocating for action, and the atmosphere in the education community suddenly became tense.

Finally, the truth came to light. From mid-May, the 800,000 yuan, some say the total was 1.4 million yuan, began to be distributed. But because public schools were issued first, when people received the relief funds, private school teachers did not receive them, and they felt even more panicked. Until recently, private schools were also issued, and their hearts calmed down, knowing that the relevant parties did indeed need time to manage the procedures before the money could be distributed today.

Our group of private school teachers and staff finally received the official notice. The principal went to collect the money that day, and the news of the distribution was what everyone cared about almost every day. Day after day, it was finally the day of distribution. Everyone went to the principal's office and took the money out, showing an inexplicable state of joy on their faces. Because even older colleagues who had taught for many years had never received such extra income.

All full-time teachers received a significant amount of money, so everyone was very happy and grateful for the central government's great virtue. Then, they planned how to use the relief funds. Buying rice, paying off debts, redeeming pawned items, and buying new clothes, everyone had their own uses. At the same time, they hoped that the central government could distribute relief funds every semester in the future.

Then, because the teachers had received relief funds, the school workers also began to call for it. Indeed, in the same organization, working on the same line, teachers had received relief funds, but school workers had not. In fact, the lives of school workers are just as painful as teachers, and their request for relief is of course reasonable.

However, this problem is somewhat difficult. First of all, the authorities designated this relief fund to relieve teachers and staff, and school workers were not included. If we appeal to the authorities, the central government will never make a big deal out of a small issue and allocate another sum specifically to relieve school workers. Then what about the teachers who got the money, and what about the school workers? Leaving them aside and letting them watch the teachers get the money? Of course, it would be unbearable!

People who get along together every day and do the same work on the same line are of course sympathetic to each other. The only way is to have a attitude of sharing a boat together, and teachers take some money from the relief fund to relieve school workers. A group of colleagues at our school decided to automatically provide relief to school workers. Whoever got more money would take out more, and whoever got less would take out less.

As a result, some gave ten yuan, some gave five yuan, and some gave three yuan or two yuan. Everyone was very willing to take out the money and collected more than one hundred yuan. It was distributed to seven or eight school workers, and each person also got more than ten yuan.

(8) Tangible Friendship

"Don't mention that, quickly continue!" In fact, this was also Yu Kun's own shortcoming, so he sympathized with Zhao Si.

"As a result, I was made drunk by them, so drunk that I was like a dead pig. I don't know when I woke up on the third day. After waking up, I still didn't know that they had done such a good show. It wasn't until Seventh Master came to tell me that the Third Boss was sick in Tianjin and was going to pack up things at home that I realized that the cash was also lost, the passbook and the acting equipment were gone, and even Rong Jin, the big guy, and two other little bastards had left together! This made me almost die of anxiety—"

Speaking of this, the sweat on Zhao Si's face and head could no longer allow him to rest for a while.

"Rong Kui, Jin the Big Guy, and their gang, don't they have someone behind them?" Yu Kun interrupted as he wiped away his sweat for the second time.

"Yes, they do, but they can't do anything!" Zhao shook his forty or fifty pound head. "Later, Seventh Master came up with the idea. On the one hand, he opened a loss report and taught me to report to the police station. On the other hand, he called the bank to send a letter, asking them not to pay when they saw the deposit slip and to detain the person immediately..." "Then were they detained?" Yu Kun thought this was a very good hope!

"Unfortunately, it was too late. One usable passbook had been emptied by them, and there were two called fixed-term deposits, which were not touched. But the people had already left. They knew they couldn't touch it, so of course they wouldn't go again!"

"In this way, is it all over?" A line from a play unconsciously rushed out of Yu Kun's mouth.

"Don't be impatient, there's more to come! Zhao Si passed a large sunflower fan from his right hand to his left." Seventh Master asked about the situation and knew that the kid Ji Zhaoxiong had been there on the first day. He immediately questioned him when he returned. I don't know how the two sides made a mistake. Seventh Master actually made that kid..." (121)
