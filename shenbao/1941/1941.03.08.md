Chongqing, the 7th - Today was the seventh day of the first General Assembly of the National Council of Participating Governments. In the morning, various committee groups convened meetings to review proposals. At 1:00 PM, the seventh session commenced with 172 participating council members present, including Chen Shiquan. Over 30 heads of various government agencies were in attendance, including Kong Xiangxi and Wang Shijie. Chairman Zhang Boling presided, with Lei Zhen and Gu Xiwu serving as recorders. Following customary procedures, the minutes of the sixth session were read. The secretariat then reported on the work of the Sichuan-Kang Development Preparatory Committee, along with over ten responses from the Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the National Food Administration regarding inquiries. After the reports, the order of discussion proceeded. First, the presidium proposed the establishment of a drafting committee for the General Assembly declaration, along with proposals for the continued establishment of the National Council of Participating Governments' Sichuan-Kang Development Preparatory Committee and various offices. Both proposals were passed by the General Assembly. As for the drafting committee members, in addition to the presidium serving as ex-officio members, Zhang Zhizhang, Hu Jianzhong, Huang Yanpei, and Chen Bosheng were added as members, to be convened by the presidium. Subsequently, the review reports of the various committee groups were discussed. The first item discussed was the deferred deliberation from the previous day regarding the method of paying fees to postpone military service. After a brief report by the convener of the review committee, the General Assembly resolved that the government may collect a small fee for exemption certificates from those legally qualified for exemption or postponement of military service to fund the preferential treatment of families of soldiers on active duty. Next, the foreign affairs report review opinions and several military-related proposals regarding the improvement of military service administration were passed. As it was past 5:00 PM, the chairman announced a ten-minute recess. After resuming the meeting, several proposals were passed, including one to send condolences to overseas Chinese in the name of the General Assembly. Finally, a proposal by Councilor Kong Geng and 23 others was discussed, requesting the adjustment of the health administration structure, emphasizing both Chinese and Western medicine, gradually seeking integration, promoting national health, and benefiting the war effort. After a heated debate, a revised proposal was passed, namely: (1) The current health administration structure will not be changed, but the Committee of Chinese Medicine should be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior. (2) The government should find ways to promote research in Chinese medicine. As it was already 6:30 PM, the meeting was adjourned. All participating council members went to the Jialing Guesthouse to attend a banquet hosted by the heads and deputy heads of the five Yuan (branches of government). It was reported that due to the large number of proposals, the General Assembly had decided to hold an additional session at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. The cases passed by the General Assembly on the 7th are selected as follows: (1) Councilor Shao Cong'en and 26 others proposed to improve the military service administration to benefit the war effort. It was resolved that this case be passed with amendments and sent to the government for earnest attention and improvement, and that the Central Military Service Inspection Group be instructed to conduct a serious investigation. (2) Councilor Huang Fan and 24 others proposed that leaders at all levels of local armed teams participating in frontline combat should be granted official ranks based on their merits to encourage them and benefit the war effort. It was resolved that the original proposal be passed and sent to the government for adoption and implementation. (3) Councilor Li Xiangen, Councilor Huang Fan, Councilor Yu Zengcheng, and Councilor Lu Zongqi and 32 others proposed to express condolences to overseas Chinese in the name of the General Assembly.

The government should find ways to promote research in Chinese medicine. (7th Telegram)

Chongqing - Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui stated during a response to inquiries at the National Council of Participating Governments that the visit of Dr. Crowley and others to China had yielded very satisfactory results.

Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech to the National Council of Participating Governments yesterday, accusing the Chinese Communist Party of repeatedly violating its promises made in 1937 to support the Three People's Principles and the National Government. Chairman Chiang emphasized that all national troops should obey military orders and strictly observe military discipline. The dissolution of the New Fourth Army was due to its violation of this principle. Chairman Chiang reiterated the importance of pacifying the internal situation while resisting foreign aggression, hoping that the military discipline issues of the Communist Party would be discussed and decided by the National Council of Participating Governments. He stated that the government would accept all suggestions offered by the National Council of Participating Governments, but only to the extent that they do not violate military orders, discipline, and the procedures for resisting aggression. The National Council of Participating Governments has decided to invite seven representatives of the Communist Party to attend and discuss how to resolve the disputes between the government and the Communist Party. The Central Daily News reported that Chiang stated in his speech, "Our country has only one army, which is the National Revolutionary Army. The National Revolutionary Army is the army of the state, and no other individual or party may have its own private army." Madame Soong Mei-ling also attended and listened to her husband's speech. This was the first time since the establishment of the National Council of Participating Governments in 1938. The Communist Party headquarters here told a United Press reporter that the Communist Party leaders and liaison officers had telegraphed the Communist Party Central Headquarters in Yan'an for instructions on whether to accept the invitation of the National Council of Participating Governments to attend.

Editorial

### Recent Panic

In the past week, the lives of Shanghai citizens have been deeply and severely affected by the unwillingness of rice hoarders to sell on the market. Not only have the black market premiums for foreign rice emerged one after another and soared uncontrollably, but the prices of other daily necessities, such as flour, have exceeded 30 yuan at retail, and rice has exceeded 120 yuan. Even soap, matches, kerosene, and candles have all increased by 130% to 140%. What is the reason for this? It is not because there are no goods arriving; goods are indeed arriving in a steady stream. One often sees large vehicles speeding through the bustling city streets, heavily laden with rice, flour, oil, candles, firewood, and soap. It is also not due to the impact of currency values, as the exchange rate has remained stable or even slightly appreciated recently, with few devaluations. Therefore, it has no bearing on changes in commodity prices. Furthermore, it is not caused by citizens hoarding, as the current prices are so exorbitant, and living spaces are so cramped and simple that they are barely sufficient for daily life. Where would there be room for hoarding? Moreover, those who struggle to make ends meet, even with a few bushels of savings, are in dire straits. How could they have the extra capacity to hoard more? In essence, the current abnormal price surge is not due to a lack of supply, excessive consumption, or currency fluctuations. Instead, it is caused by the greedy and monopolistic practices of those who operate the businesses. They compete with each other, believing that storing goods is the best strategy, waiting for even better prices before selling. They would rather refuse current transactions to exploit future opportunities. Seeing the difficulty of purchasing goods, people rush to buy, fearing they will miss out. After repeatedly failing to find supplies, they cannot help but look at each other in dismay. Given this situation, those who care about the fate of the entire city of Shanghai should not overlook the panic that market traders have caused in recent days. It is important to understand that the level of panic today far exceeds the commonly heard complaints about rising prices and difficult living conditions.

Wise and experienced gentlemen of the business community, are you paying attention? Those greedy and unscrupulous merchants are beyond reasoning with or arguing with. Why not quietly observe the current market conditions? It is no longer the so-called abnormally developed market situation of the past two or three years. Instead, it is definitely trending towards decline and approaching exhaustion. Not only has the volume of goods actually sold decreased sharply, but the amount of money actually collected after the dramatic price increases has also gradually fallen. This is a serious crisis. How many businesses and families can still boast of a bustling clientele? Those who hesitate at the door must have needs, but when they see the high prices, they turn away. What business is immune to this, and what place is immune to this? Furthermore, consider the internal situation of each industry. Business owners and managers are secretly calculating how to save expenses and reduce staff. They find fault to dismiss employees, and they enforce rules strictly to dismiss them. Those who can no longer maintain their original state due to business decline are making even more drastic cuts. As a result, the number of unemployed people in the city is undoubtedly staggering. Recently, the power company has begun to gradually reduce electricity supply, which will inevitably force factories that rely on electricity to reduce production and lay off workers. Will this lead to a mass unemployment of the city's small-scale businesses? This is indeed a particularly serious crisis. All these crises cannot be averted by the efforts of one or two individuals. However, aware of this crisis, the enlightened business community should not each just stick to their own positions. Should they not seek ways to help each other? Even if they do not help each other, they should at least encourage and warn each other, how can they be different from the market traders and not exacerbate the crisis?

The concession authorities, who have the responsibility of maintaining the entire city, are they paying attention? The crisis is so deep that the concession authorities should not underestimate themselves too much, nor should they excuse themselves too much. The excuses of limited authority and difficult circumstances are not mere shirkings of responsibility. Residents within the concessions have heard them often and know them well. However, over the years, residents have cooperated with the concession authorities to a significant extent despite facing countless difficulties. How will the authorities cooperate with the residents? Chinese residents account for the vast majority of the population, and there are some who are extremely evil. One should not tolerate the actions of the extremely evil, thinking that Chinese people do not care for each other, so it is permissible to indulge them, or that the extremely evil can be active among the vast majority, so cooperation is possible. All these claims, we hope, are unfounded, and we do not wish to imply anything specific. However, the concession authorities must be open to self-examination, must work for the benefit of the vast majority, and must cooperate with the vast majority. This is what we firmly believe should be the iron rule adopted by the authorities. How to achieve welfare and cooperation? Regarding the reduction of electricity supply, there are rumors that "the amount of electricity supplied to the public in the future should be reduced by a smaller percentage than that supplied to commercial enterprises, which is expected to be unanimously agreed upon." This would indeed serve the welfare of the vast majority of residents, and we are willing to praise it in the future. However, the authorities should now take precautions against various covert obstructions and overt sophistries. For example, it may be argued that commercial enterprises are related to tax revenue, the prosperity of the market, the regulation of citizens' lives, and the livelihoods of commercial operators. Are these not all reasons that can be used to argue that there should not be a strict, thorough, and maximum reduction in the supply of electricity to commercial enterprises? Little do they know that every extra bit of frivolous consumption reduces legitimate power. As a result, production is affected, workers are affected, and the unemployment problem becomes more serious, ultimately affecting the entire city of Shanghai. Regarding the rice problem, the authorities have never investigated and publicly announced the actual situation of rice reserves and continuous imports. They have neither confirmed the claim of having over 1.1 million piculs of rice in storage and effectively cracking down on rice weevils, nor corrected this claim to encourage residents to plan together. If the authorities claim to have unspeakable difficulties, residents will have no way to sympathize and will continue to resent them. The public feels that the high prices of all goods are due to the high price of rice, the difficulty of living is due to the high price of rice, unemployment is due to the high price of rice, and everything can be traced back to rice. Meanwhile, the concession authorities are all wise, sincere, and capable, with the power to do everything except deal with rice! Although the situation may not be entirely like this, this is definitely the public's sentiment.

In times of hardship and danger, those who experience hardship and danger will naturally make more and stricter criticisms. This is what is called unavoidable human nature. We are unwilling to further fuel the irresponsible and inaccurate criticisms. However, the enlightened business community should set a good example, and the responsible concession authorities should urgently seek effective actions to reassure the vast majority of residents who are in hardship and danger, stabilize public morale, and reduce panic. This is something that cannot be delayed.

### Soviet Material Aid to China More Active Than Before; China Receives Large Quantities of Military Supplies; Road Transport Also Accelerated

Chongqing - A high-ranking government official told a United Press reporter today that in the past few months, Soviet material aid to China has not only not decreased as rumored abroad, but has actually increased significantly. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, who has visited Moscow several times since the outbreak of the war, told a United Press reporter that the amount of military supplies China ordered in its latest purchase alone was greater than what China had previously received from the United States. President Sun explained that when the Soviet-Finnish War first broke out, Soviet aid to China had decreased slightly, but the reason for this was easily understandable. The Soviet Union had learned lessons in the war against Finland and was manufacturing new types of aircraft and military equipment. Soviet-style aircraft were at a disadvantage against Japanese-style aircraft, so China did not need these Soviet aircraft. However, since November of last year, the situation has changed, and China is now receiving more supplies than before. The transportation of this large quantity of supplies was affected by the inconvenience of road transport during the winter, but it has now been accelerated. President Sun also stated that all Soviet aid is delivered directly to the central government. Only some medical supplies are delivered directly to the Communist Eighth Route Army, which were transported to Yan'an about a year ago. It is very difficult to transport tea to the Soviet Union to repay Soviet loans because it is many times more difficult than usual, but the government is fulfilling its obligations as usual, despite the difficulties.

Sun Ke's Talk with Foreign Reporters

Chongqing - Dr. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, told a United Press reporter today that if the Japanese navy still dominates the East China Sea, then any so-called Sino-Japanese peace is actually "Japan's peace." He explained that China's victory in the war against Japan is linked to the victory of the global anti-aggression war. China's purpose in fighting is to ensure that all aspects of China's national existence are not restricted by Japan, and not just to drive Japanese troops out of China. China's leaders have this responsibility and are determined to fight to achieve this goal. However, if the Japanese navy can still completely control the Asian coast, then this goal can never be achieved. As long as the Japanese navy remains dominant, no peace that is concluded can be maintained for long. Finally, he said that he believed that the annihilation or neutralization of the Japanese navy depended on the United States' participation in the world war. China's true leaders, including Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, thoroughly understand the necessity of the aforementioned purpose of the Chinese war and are fully aware of the great disadvantages of negotiating peace, so they are all determined to continue fighting.

### British Merchants Face Increasing Difficulties Due to Japanese Exclusion

London - Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons yesterday that British merchants wishing to sell imported goods directly to customers in occupied areas of China are facing increasing difficulties. He could not say whether this was happening everywhere. Conservative MP Kerr asked whether the British government had made representations to the Japanese government, given that this move violated the Open Door Policy. Butler replied that representations had been made repeatedly on such matters, and the entire issue was being kept under consideration. Conservative MP Hannah asked whether Britain was handling this matter jointly with the United States. Butler replied, "We are always handling it jointly with the United States." Kerr also asked whether the Foreign Secretary was aware that in occupied areas of China, the expenses of the Japanese army were largely covered by taxes paid by Japanese companies established under the supervision of the army, and that exports from occupied areas must pass through transport routes monopolized by Japanese companies. He asked whether the British government intended to take action to prevent the imposition of heavy taxes on British merchants. Butler replied that he could only reiterate what he told the House of Commons on February 26, namely that the trade and exchange system established by the Japanese favored Japanese merchants, and the British government was paying close attention to the impact this was having on British trade.

### Thai-Vietnamese Compromise Diplomatic Procedures to be Completed Soon: French Side Fully Accepts Japanese Compromise Plan, New Boundaries to be Demarcated by Border Committee

Tokyo - According to semi-official Japanese sources, the conference to mediate the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, which began a month ago, is expected to conclude smoothly today. Well-informed sources said that diplomatic procedures to achieve a complete compromise between the two sides this afternoon are expected to be completed this morning. As a result of three urgent meetings between Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and the French ambassador to Japan, Henri, the French side fully agreed to the Japanese compromise proposal on Thursday, thus laying the foundation for signing an agreement to resolve the border dispute that has been ongoing since May. It is reported that the second extension of the Franco-Thai ceasefire, which expires at noon today, will not be "formally extended" again. Japan obtained assurances from both the Thai and French armies on Thursday that they would no longer engage in aggressive actions. On that day, Japanese representative Matsumiya and French representative Robin (former Governor of Vietnam), as well as Saito, Director of the South Seas Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and Thai representative Phisetsuratham (Thai Minister to Japan), held separate meetings and obtained the aforementioned assurances. The Hochi Shimbun reported that if France adopts a "lukewarm attitude" when discussing the remaining points regarding the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute, in an attempt to delay the conclusion of the Tokyo talks, Japan will have no choice but to take a "tough stance and abandon its friendly attitude of respecting France's reputation" during the mediation. France should make every effort to expedite the conclusion of the Tokyo Conference before the ceasefire expires to show sincerity and avoid the resurgence of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute. Although both sides have reached an agreement on the key points of Japan's proposal, the Japanese government still cannot be overly optimistic about the future of the Tokyo Conference. The Miyako Shimbun stated that the Tokyo Conference has passed a critical juncture, and Thailand and France have achieved their goals through mutual concessions, which is beneficial to both countries. France should appreciate Japan's fair attitude in the mediation, as this is the wise course of action. France should also cooperate with Japan to establish a new order and stabilize the situation in East Asia. (Reuters, 7th)

### Chinese Seamen Strike Over Unfair Treatment, Subjected to Scrutiny

London - Twenty-one Chinese seamen were convicted by the London Police Court for disobeying orders. The seamen appealed to the London Appeals Committee, which heard the case yesterday. The appeal was accepted for ten Chinese seamen who were sentenced to six months of hard labor, while the appeals of the remaining eleven, who were sentenced to one year of recognizance, were rejected. The plaintiffs' lawyer stated that when the seamen arrived in Hong Kong, they refused to work because they did not receive the £5 monthly allowance given to white seamen navigating dangerous waters, which they considered unfair. They were dissatisfied with their monthly pay of £3, which caused delays in the ship's schedule and disrupted the entire escort system. The defendant's lawyer, Hutchinson, stated that he was appearing on behalf of the Chinese Embassy. He said that the Chinese people are not only a civilized nation but also exceptionally brave and lively, and it is regrettable that they receive less compensation than white people. The matter has been raised in Parliament. (Reuters, 7th)

### Rumors of Matsuoka's European Visit Cannot be Confirmed

Tokyo - Deputy Spokesman Ishii of the Information Bureau of the Japanese Cabinet today refused to confirm or deny reports that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka would travel to Moscow and Berlin on a diplomatic mission. Ishii also stated that he had no information about reports that German Ambassador to Japan, Ott, would return to Berlin. (Associated Press, 7th)

### Germany Lures Anti-German Youth in the Netherlands to Their Deaths

London - Street brawls, strikes, sabotage, and organized insults against German troops have repeatedly occurred in the Netherlands, causing great distress to the German secret police. They have used the lure of "assistance to England" to entice out organizers of anti-German activities and arrest them. The Dutch government radio station in England has warned patriotic Dutch people not to fall for the tricks of the German secret police. The Free Netherlands newspaper, published in London, revealed the methods of the German police today. It is said that the German police have recently deliberately spread a message claiming that young people who wish to join the Dutch army in England can report to a certain rural area. There is a large lake in the area, and British seaplanes will land there to transport qualified volunteers to England. However, the German police have secretly set up ambushes, and any young people who appear are arrested and imprisoned in the Scheveningen prison. (Reuters, 7th)

### The Times on Soviet-Japanese Relations in the Far East: Soviet and Japanese Positions Have Reversed in Recent Years; Japan's Attempts to Appease the Soviets Are Unsuccessful

London - The Times published a lengthy article on Soviet-Japanese relations in the Far East, stating that the current state of Soviet-Japanese relations began in the autumn of 1931, when Japan seized Manchuria in northeastern China. The Soviet Union was suspicious of Japan because Japan was willing to occupy eastern Siberia and northern Sakhalin Island, while Tokyo was concerned about the communist program and was also suspicious of the Soviet Union. However, before 1931, the two countries had no conflicts and were able to coexist peacefully. After the establishment of the Manchukuo puppet state, Japan wanted to secure the common border with the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, and the relations between the two countries were no longer as calm as before. Over six years, a total of 180 recognized incidents occurred. The most famous incident was the conflict on the Amur River in the early summer of 1937. The Soviet Union suffered a military defeat in this battle and had no diplomatic response. This weakness was probably due to the Soviet purges, and Japan saw this as an excellent opportunity to begin its major speculative actions in China. At that time, the Soviet Union repeatedly proposed concluding a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact, but Japan repeatedly refused. The Soviet Union even handed over the Chinese Eastern Railway under Japanese pressure. In addition to the repeated border disputes, fishing rights in Soviet territorial waters, which were ceded to Japan by the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905, were also a source of friction between the Soviet Union and Japan. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Soviet Union was not to be outdone and strengthened the defense of the Amur border, laid a double track on the Siberian Railway, strengthened its forces in the Far East, and built strong air force bases on Arctic islands. Since 1937, Japan has been engaged in China, and the military forces of the United States on the border have gradually become stronger than before. Although Japan wanted to prevent Soviet aid to China, it was ultimately unsuccessful. In the summer of 1939, the most intense and bloody battle of the Soviet-Japanese border war in ten years took place in Nomonhan. The Soviet Union won a great victory, which Japan also admitted. In these two months, the casualties in the small-scale war were no less than 18,000. In September of that year, a ceasefire agreement was reached, at which time the Soviet Union and Germany had already signed a pact, and the European war had broken out. From then on, Germany made great efforts to court Japan, hoping that the Soviet Union and Japan would become friendly. At this time, the Soviet and Japanese positions had already reversed, unlike a few years ago. It was the Soviet Union that had requested to conclude a non-aggression treaty, but now it was Japan. Japan agreed to reconsider the issue of fishing rights and was prepared to acknowledge the condition that it would not oppose Soviet aid to China, but the Moscow government held its head high and did not listen. The fundamental antagonism between the two powers in the Far East still exists today. Both sides have their strengths and weaknesses. Siberia is sparsely populated, especially in the east. It is not easy for the Soviet Union to defend, but the area is vast, and it is difficult for Japan to effectively occupy it. Japan certainly has the advantage in terms of its active and concentrated military strength, but it lacks the raw materials needed for war and is vulnerable to external resistance, and its famous cities are also vulnerable to air attacks. The Soviet Union cannot fight on both the eastern and western fronts at the same time. Although its pact with Germany is only a worthless guarantee in itself, its effectiveness as a source of supply for Germany is certainly its current shield in the West. As for the Soviet Union in the East, its strategic position is not enviable. Manchuria's terrain juts into Soviet territory like an ax head, forming a 2,000-mile border. The Soviet Union's coastal provinces are also quite far apart and have no ice-free ports. Japan has abandoned its old friendship with Britain and is pursuing a policy of open hostility to British commerce and interests in China. It has also created poor relations with the United States. If it were to start a war with the United States, it would inevitably use Korea, Manchuria, and North China as its bases. However, the conquered people living in the aforementioned places have never forgotten the opportunity to take revenge and make trouble for Japan. From a global perspective, the Soviet Union cannot seek peace with Japan, whose policy is based on the Tanaka Memorial. The Soviet Union's hope for commercial expansion lies in China, and for its commercial expansion, China must be free, friendly, and prosperous. The Japanese authorities have not lost their fear and dislike of communism. The existence of the Soviet Union will always be an obstacle to Japan's hegemony in China. Is this true fundamental antagonism between the two Asian powers not allowing them to approach each other? Will Stalin pursue a policy of appeasement towards Japan in exchange for temporary security and some tangible benefits in Asia, which is worth trying? This is an open question. As for the Soviet Union preventing Japan from advancing south, it is not possible to say. The Soviet Union has no motivation to encourage Japan to advance south and may even see the friction between Japan and the United States and Britain over the southern advance policy as beneficial to itself.

### Soviet and Turkish Attitudes Determine the Safety of the Balkans: Turkish Troops Massed on Western Border, Ready to Repel German Attack

Budapest - The government newspaper "Magyar Hirlap" here stated that the entire Balkan situation depends on the attitudes of Turkey and the Soviet Union. German troops could pressure Greece from Bulgaria after cutting off Albania and then deliver a fatal blow. (Associated Press, 7th)

Budapest - It is reported that Turkey diverted thousands of troops from its border with the Soviet Union last night to the western border facing Greece and German-occupied Bulgaria. "The number of Turkish soldiers deployed in the Balkans is estimated to exceed 1,000,000." Turkey's new military actions are followed by a large fleet concentrated in the Dardanelles. Diplomatic circles here believe that this proves Turkey has taken a tough stance against German threats to Turkey and Greece, and may have obtained the consent of the Soviet Union. Sources in diplomatic circles indicate that Turkey will never allow German troops to freely pass through European Turkey or occupy the Bosphorus Strait. (Associated Press, 7th)

Berlin - According to the German military authorities, the entry of German troops into Bulgaria is not affected by heavy snow and rugged mountain roads. All troops have arrived at their designated locations according to the original plan. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)

London - The Turkish radio station in Ankara announced last night that after German troops entered Bulgaria, they have now assembled a large army, using trains, trucks, and buses, to move towards the Bulgarian-Greek border. Germany wants to engage Britain in a place where it can fight Britain, so it is now looking for the weakest point in Britain's defense chain. (Reuters, 7th)

Sofia - General Lieutenant Rickert, commander-in-chief of the German forces in Bulgaria, arrived here yesterday and will stay for a short time. He was accompanied by German Minister Richthofen to meet with King Boris and Prime Minister Filov. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)

Rumor: Germany Proposes a Non-Aggression Pact to Turkey

Bern, Switzerland - The "Basler Nachrichten" recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Ankara stating that diplomats from neutral countries in Ankara believe that German leader Hitler's letter to Turkish President Ismet, in addition to providing assurances that Germany fully respects Turkey's territorial integrity, may have included a proposal for Germany and Turkey to conclude a non-aggression pact. As for the reply that Turkey should submit, it was discussed at a cabinet meeting yesterday, and it is likely to be sent to the German government today. Once it is delivered to Berlin, the Turkish government will issue a statement clarifying the situation. The Turkish government's intentions will then be seen in this reply. (Havas, 6th)

Ankara - While political circles here await the start of the German spring offensive, they believe that the Soviet Union's attitude is now quite inclined towards Britain. Last night, Moscow Radio reiterated for the third time the Soviet Union's anger at Bulgaria's joining the Axis alliance. Well-informed sources believe that Hitler's recent letter to the Turkish President contains four points. The most important point is that Germany states that it urgently hopes that Turkey will send senior officials to Berlin, and Germany will also send senior officials to Ankara. The remaining points are (1) we recognize that Germany has designs on the Dardanelles Strait, (2) guaranteeing that Germany has no intention of invading Turkey, (3) a lengthy review of history since the Treaty of Versailles, criticizing Britain for luring and coercing small countries such as Turkey. (Associated Press, 7th)

Ankara - It was announced today that the Turkish Cabinet will hold a meeting on Sunday, and Prime Minister Saydam will deliver a speech on Wednesday. It is reported that the above-mentioned authorities still hold a dismissive attitude towards Hitler's letter to the Turkish President, and all believe that the Turkish Ambassador to Berlin will soon deliver the Turkish government's reply to the German side. Currently, Berlin and Rome are jointly using sweet words with the aim of guaranteeing Turkey that it need not fear Germany's occupation of Bulgaria. A Turkish member of parliament published an article in a newspaper detailing the rapid entry of German troops into Bulgaria, saying that Germany has now become Turkey's neighbor, so Turkey must pay unprecedented attention, as Turkey has long been familiar with Nazi tactics. (Reuters, 7th)

London - There is currently no reason to believe that Yugoslavia will sign a convention with the Axis powers in the near future. Germany has issued some unconfirmed rumors from the capital of Yugoslavia as part of a psychological war. One rumor claims that Britain has sent or intends to send an ultimatum to Yugoslavia. Regarding the recent diplomatic activities in Nanjing, although reports from British Minister to Yugoslavia, Sir Campbell, have not been obtained here, the claim of an ultimatum is definitely unreliable. According to a radio message from the capital of Yugoslavia, Deputy Cabinet Coordinator Dr. Martic told reporters from various newspapers that the government is constantly considering the country's highest interests and its independence. Regent Prince Paul met with Martic yesterday and had long talks with the Prime Minister and military leaders. (Reuters, 7th)

Belgrade - People here now believe that the Yugoslav government and newspapers' strong claims that German-Yugoslav relations are good are a reliable indication that the country is about to announce increased cooperation with Germany. Reliable Yugoslav sources said yesterday that the government may announce a policy of greater cooperation with Germany within 48 hours. Reliable Yugoslav sources said that Germany may not force Yugoslavia to accept the same policy as Bulgaria, but they may adopt a middle ground, similar to the current relationship between Sweden and Germany. Under these conditions, Yugoslavia would not only allow Germany to transport military supplies, but also allow German vehicles carrying wounded soldiers to pass through Yugoslav territory. (Associated Press, 7th)

Capital of Yugoslavia - It is rumored that Yugoslavia has been invited to mediate the Italo-Greek War. Officials here have solemnly denied this. It is also widely rumored that the Axis powers have demanded that if Yugoslavia does not want to formally join the Axis, it must at least issue a statement declaring its support for the Axis powers' policies and expressing its willingness to participate in the construction of a new European order. If this were to happen, the Axis powers would respect its territorial integrity, and Hungary and Bulgaria would also abandon their territorial demands on the country. This statement has neither been confirmed nor denied by officials. (Havas, 6th)

Rumor: Soviet Union Makes Demands on Romania; Germany Says It Knows Nothing About It

Berlin - Well-informed German sources said yesterday that they had no knowledge of overseas reports that the Soviet Union had demanded that Romania cede Constanta, Galati, and the naval base of Tulcea. (Associated Press, 7th)

New York - Yesterday, newspapers published a touching report stating that the Soviet Union had issued an ultimatum to Romania, demanding a naval base in the Black Sea. However, the capitals of the countries involved in Europe, Romania, England, and Germany, all denied this yesterday. Therefore, this matter has likely been misreported. In the current situation, it is not expected that the Soviet Union will take a tough stance on the Balkans. Whether Germany's further intrusion into the Soviet Union's "sphere of influence" will cause Stalin to fight remains a mystery. (International Telegraph, 7th)

### Greece is United Nationally, Vows to Fight to the End: Soldiers on the Front Lines Advance Without Retreat, Always Maintaining an Active Position

Athens - Officials have recently declared that Greece will not sign any peace treaty or accept any armistice agreement until the enemy has been completely defeated and begs for peace. Rumors that the Greek cabinet and King George II have different opinions, with George II advocating fighting to the end, even if it means retreating to Crete to continue fighting, while Prime Minister Koryzis advocates making peace with Italy, are completely untrue. The Greek government and people are united on the policy of resistance. (Havas, 7th)

Athens - A Greek Information Department bulletin broadcast last night stated that the morale of the Greek soldiers is high and they remain in an active position. The Greek soldiers are determined to deal with all unforeseen events and will not flinch. The bulletin also stated that the Greek army continued to make progress on the Albanian front yesterday. Greek army patrols were successful, and artillery fire on Italian army positions was quite effective. A local encounter occurred in the central sector, resulting in the Greek army capturing some strong Italian army positions. (Reuters, 7th)

### General Weygand Returns to France to Report

Vichy - General Weygand recently arrived here by plane from Algiers and met with Marshal Pétain. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Darlan returned from Paris approximately last night and will also meet with Weygand. (Reuters, 7th)

### The United States Demands Italy Close Two Consulates: Italy Had Taken Similar Action; The United States Retaliates

Washington - Dispatches received here indicate that the German occupation of Italy is even more complete than the German occupation of Bulgaria. It is reported that all Italian seaports are now under German control, and the Italian secret police are now commanded by senior German police officers. Therefore, Italy can be regarded as a province of Germany. After German troops occupied most of Italy, such as Sicily, the Italian government asked the United States to close the two US consulates in Naples and Palermo. Therefore, the US State Department yesterday notified the Italian Embassy in the United States to close the two Italian consulates in Detroit and Newark and transfer the personnel of the two consulates to other locations. Another important point in this note is that apart from the diplomatic personnel of the Italian Embassy in Washington, the movements of Italian consulate personnel must be limited to their office area. In addition, if the military attachés of the Italian Embassy in Washington act outside of Washington, they must notify the US State Department at any time. Secretary of State Hull did not explain the reasons for this extraordinary move in this note, but the tone expressed dissatisfaction with the closure of the two US consulates in Naples and Palermo. There are many Italian immigrants in Detroit and Newark, and the Fascist Party is also very active. (Reuters, 7th)

### US Government Reports to the Senate: Pacific Defense Spending, Most Used for Hawaii

Washington - When the Army and Navy budget bill was reported to the Senate yesterday, Hawaii ranked first among the Army and Navy bases in the Pacific islands that the US government designated to strengthen its defenses. The funds allocated to Hawaii in the bill exceeded US$130 million. Other funds were allocated to Samoa for US$8.1 million, to Wake Island for US$2,954,500, to Guam for US$4.7 million, to a submarine base for US$6.115 million, and to a naval airfield on Midway Island for US$5,592,000. Within the Hawaiian expenditure, US$68,270,000 was allocated to construct housing, storage rooms, and bomb shelters for the Pearl Harbor Navy, US$125,000 was allocated to construct a submarine base in Pearl Harbor, US$1,014,500 was allocated to construct the Kaneohe Bay Naval Air Station, US$26,000,000 was allocated to construct a naval hospital in Pearl Harbor, and US$23,000,000 was allocated to construct bomb shelters in the 14th Naval District. In addition, US$35,000,000 was allocated to construct four marine barracks, one of which will be in Pearl Harbor. (Associated Press, 7th)

### The United States Allocates Huge Funds to Build New Ships

New York - The New Republic magazine stated that the US Congress has allocated $6.5 billion to expand naval construction. As of September 9, 1940, the US government had already ordered 200 warships, totaling $4 billion. At the same time, in order to increase shipyard capacity, the Navy Department has loaned $76 million to private shipbuilding companies. Currently, the US Navy's shipbuilding plan includes seven battleships, 115 destroyers, 43 submarines, eight aircraft carriers, and 27 cruisers. (TASS, 7th)

### Dr. Currie Arrives in Honolulu, Believes Japan's Blockade of China Cannot Succeed

Honolulu - Dr. Currie, President Roosevelt's special envoy to Chongqing, arrived here last night by clipper from Manila and will return to Washington to make a confidential report to President Roosevelt. Dr. Currie declined to comment on Japan's recent movements, but he said that China has many supply routes, which are extremely difficult to completely block. Currie meant that Japan's blockade of China, so far, has only been partially effective. Dr. Desbury, a government economic expert who accompanied Currie to Chongqing, was also traveling with him. (Associated Press, 7th)

### Polish Ambassador to the US Presents Credentials

Washington - The new Polish Ambassador to the United States, Krzyzanowski, presented his credentials to President Roosevelt today. He is the first ambassador to the United States since the Polish government went into exile in London. (Havas, 6th)

Commercial News

### Foodstuffs: The Price of Japonica Rice Rises Daily; Imported Rice Premiums Increase Subtly and Steadily

The rice market, which once shifted from a tight to a slack situation in the previous days, saw the opposite happen yesterday. For both thick and thin japonica and domestic rice, the market opened with buyers generally taking a cautious view due to the previous day's pullback, fearing a sudden drop from the high plateau. They were hesitant to move forward, but sellers, with limited supplies, remained firm on prices. However, with trading activity muted, a standoff ensued. Unexpectedly, the off-market trading of imported rice suddenly tightened again, prompting renewed confidence among buyers who rushed to secure supplies. Seizing the opportunity, sellers raised prices, increasing gradually. Although the frenzy was not as intense as in the previous two days, it was nonetheless significant. As a result, Kunshan rice was priced at $120 per dan (unit of dry measure) for white japonica, $118 for the next grade, $123 for regular japonica, and Qingjiao rice was at $118 per dan for thin rice, $117.50 for the next grade, and $122 for original packages, an increase of more than two dollars from the previous day. Much of this rice was mixed with imported rice. Supply and demand for glutinous rice remained similar, lacking any changes. Hong Kong special grade was priced at $97-98, and the next grade at $95-96.

The off-market trading of imported rice, although initially softened by the arrival of large quantities of spot goods the day before, saw renewed tightening yesterday due to rumors of hoarding for both speculative and actual sales. Manipulators were demanding high prices, and the black market thrived. The premium for 100 bags of Xiaojiao rice reached $1,800, while Saigon Siam No. 1 was at $1,700-1,800, the next grade at $1,300, and broken rice at $1,000, an increase of $1-2. Amidst this chaotic and unpredictable market, one thing brought relief: Qinren Trading Co. offered 500 bags of Siam No. 1 rice at $85 per bag, with a limit of 20 bags per buyer. Although the quantity was limited, if everyone were as mindful as Qinren Trading Co., the public's food supply would not be as dire as it is now.

### Clock Tower Brand Flour: Over 30,000 More Bags Arrive

Flour: The imported flour market remained stable yesterday. In terms of supply, in addition to the recent arrival of over 200,000 bags of Kemp flour, shipments from Hong Kong continued to arrive. Yesterday, over 30,000 bags of Clock Tower brand flour arrived via the Qingyuan ship from Hong Kong and have already been stored in warehouses. Other settled orders are also expected to arrive soon. As a result, public sentiment is not as excited as it was in the previous two days. However, with the temporary suspension of cheap flour sales by Chinese factories, actual sales in the market remain active. Holders are attempting to maintain prices. Unified market prices for Australia's Open Flower Bird brand flour were $29.05, and China's Golden Dragon brand Kemp flour was $28.05, a difference of one dollar. The market is in a state of build up, with total transactions of over 5,000 bags.

Wheat: The market situation remained stagnant yesterday. Stocks of domestic wheat have been depleted for a long time. While there have been some shipments of imported wheat, they are all pre-ordered by factories. The amount circulating in the market is practically nonexistent. There are only asking prices, but no actual transactions.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Quiet

Foreign Exchange: The foreign exchange market was quiet yesterday. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The black market for British and American currency offered nothing remarkable. Throughout the day, the market saw alternating periods of tightness and looseness, but nothing that attracted much attention. Speculators engaged in minor transactions, both buying and selling. The market saw a brief period of tightness in the morning when the Japanese bank came in to buy, but it eased again as the American bank supplied ample funds. The transaction price for American currency for this month was mostly at $5.50. Although there were some later transactions, the price remained the same. The closing spot price for American currency was still $5.50, and for British currency, it was 3/59375 shillings, a decrease of 0.015625 from the previous day. American currency saw no significant gains or losses, with a slight divergence between futures and spot prices.

The Japanese Bank Made Purchases

In the early morning, both near and far term London exchange rates were level, the New York silver price remained level, and the London gold price remained fixed. Exchange rates against American and Shanghai currencies were unchanged. The American exchange rate against the British exchange rate shrunk by 25, but remained unchanged against the Shanghai currency. There was no market for the French exchange rate. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The bank opened the morning with a spot selling price of 3/59375 shillings for British gold and $5.46875 for American currency, which was 0.015625 tighter and 0.03125 weaker respectively than the previous day's closing price. However, the market hardened after opening because speculators were looking to sell, but foreign banks were not interested in buying. As a result, the Chinese banks in Shanghai absorbed the speculators' American currency for April at $5.50. At 9:30 AM, HSBC announced that their listed rates would remain unchanged. Later, when the Japanese bank came in to make purchases again, the market suddenly tightened. Foreign banks sold American currency for this month at $5.46875. Soon after, an American bank agreed to supply, and the Japanese and Chinese banks bought spot American currency from them at a stable price of $5.50. Speculators also had needs and re-entered Chase Bank, still buying American currency for this month at $5.50. There were few changes at noon. The spot price for American currency was reported at $5.50, and the price for British currency was 3/59375 shillings.

Supply and Demand Stabilized in the Afternoon

The market was quiet in the afternoon, with little trading and stable supply and demand. It was reported that Dutch merchants from Anta sold American currency for this month at $5.50 to brokers, who then resold it to small money shops for the same month at the same price. There was little fluctuation until the close of trading. As a result, the spot and this month's price for British currency was 3/59375 shillings, and the price for next month was 3/34375 shillings. The spot price for American currency was $5.50, the price for this month was $5.46875, and the price for next month was $5.4375. Compared to the previous day's price, British currency was 0.015625 tighter for both spot and this month's delivery, American currency was stable for spot delivery, and 0.03125 weaker for this month's delivery.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Unchanged

Hong Kong, 7th (Friday) dispatch: The exchange market opened calmly this morning. The British, American, and Japanese exchange rates were all unchanged. (The spot price of American currency closed at $24.50 yesterday.) The spot price of Shanghai currency rose by one dollar to $445. At 11:30 AM, the market was reported as calm. The spot price of Shanghai currency fell back one dollar to $444, with no other gains or losses. At 2:30 PM, the market was reported as calm, with no changes in any exchange rates.

Tianjin Also Unchanged

Tianjin, 7th (Friday) dispatch: The exchange market opened slightly looser this morning. The London and New York telegraphic transfer rates remained unchanged. The Shanghai currency fell by 7.5 cents to $87.25. The "Joint Note" (联钞) black market rate rose by one dollar to $73. (The telegraph code may contain errors.)

### Gold Market: Major Players Watch and Wait, Mostly Scalping Transactions

The fluctuations in the black market spot price of gold yesterday appeared narrower compared to the previous few days, but the underlying trend remained firm. The price consistently hovered above $6,300. In the early morning, it briefly fell from a high of $6,360 to $6,310 due to selling by Hesheng and Dafeng, among others. The market recovered and stabilized by noon. There were no significant events later in the day, and trading volume decreased. This was largely due to the uncertain trend in foreign exchange, leading operators to mostly engage in scalping. Major players watched and waited. The closing price was $6,331, a decrease of one dollar from the previous day. Total transaction volume was approximately 15,000 taels. The spot price saw a gradual decline. Yongfeng Yu issued 20 taels of Joint Notes, at a premium of $470 over the forward price. Silver shops engaged in 20 tael transactions, at a premium of $460. In the afternoon, Chengji issued 50 taels, and Fengxiang and Heji issued 30 taels, which were bought by Shunyuan, at a premium of $440. Jewelry gold was down $10, to $690.

Fluctuations Without Major Ups and Downs

In the early morning, there was significant buying activity in the off-market after the previous day's closing, leading to firm prices. The market opened with a strong push, reaching $6,350, an increase of about $30. After opening, the price rose another $10 amid the enthusiasm, reaching $6,360. However, the upward momentum could not be sustained, and sellers poured in, including Hesheng, Dafeng, Xinfengyong, and Yida, flooding the market. The price gradually fell, but did not breach the $6,300 mark, stopping at $6,310. Subsequently, the market recovered slightly due to buying by Rencheng Yonggonghe, combined with the re-entry of Xinfengyong, hovering around $6,345. Although the exchange market did not undergo major changes, the underlying trend showed weakness, and market sentiment followed suit. By the noon close, Yida, Chengda, and Xinfengyong were inclined to sell, resulting in a price of $6,318. The market opened quietly in the afternoon, and the price remained unchanged at $6,318. After opening, the price rose due to exclusive buying by Chengji, but trading volume was low, reaching $6,333. Ultimately, Tongkangyong and Xinfengyong ran out of support, leading to a small decline to $6,315. Leading up to the close of trading, scattered retail buying pushed the price to $6,331, a decrease of one dollar from the previous day. Based on the settlement price of $5.6875 for March American currency, the price was $6,368, a reduction of $37. The total fluctuation for the day was only $50. After the close of trading, Tongkangyong re-entered the market, pushing the price to $6,335. The selling price of spot gold at cash shops was $460 higher than the spot price of gold futures and the purchase price was $80 lower. There were no transactions involving current and future margin calls.

Ornamental Gold Down Ten Dollars

The selling price of gold ornaments per tael in silver shops was reduced by ten dollars, with Da Tong Hang quoting $690. The prices at Xin Tong Hang were similar to previous prices, and the purchase price was reduced by forty dollars.

### Securities: Public Bonds Show a Depressed Trend

Public Bonds: Yesterday's market conditions for public bonds were once again characterized by consolidation and weakness. The repeated consolidation of market prices resulted in a lack of trading activity, and market sentiment remained extremely sluggish, leading to a rather depressed trend. It is difficult to break through this stalemate in the short term. Yesterday's market prices saw slight weakness in the morning. Tongkang provided some support, while Renchang and Renfeng continued to buy, and Lianyi also had some needs. Hongda and Lianhe sold relatively more of Category B bonds. Xie Kang and Jiufeng sold 350,000 of Category C bonds and also sold Category D bonds, which caused a slight weakness in market prices. Trading volume was already sparse in the afternoon. Renchang and Renfeng continued to absorb bonds, and Lianhe made up for previous sales. Sanka was slightly receptive. Changtai, Xieda, Lianyi, and Xinchang sold bonds, resulting in a uniform decline of one to two and a half jiao (1/10 of a dollar). Total trading volume was estimated to be a little over one million dollars. A concise summary is provided below.

Stock Trading: 30 shares of Family Industrial Cooperative were traded at a price of $90 each.

London, 6th (Thursday) dispatch: The listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat and sluggish today. Only the price of Mercantile Bank shares continued to rise by seven shillings and sixpence, to a price of eight and a half pounds. There were no other changes.

### Lever Brothers to Distribute Dividends

Lever Brothers (China) Limited plans to distribute a final dividend of $2 per share for 1940. The annual general meeting of shareholders is scheduled to be held on March 19.

### Yarn and Thread: Mixed Yarn Sales Stagnate; Double Horse Brand's Position Weakens Daily

The yarn market continued to weaken, and its position was quite precarious. This was due to the narrow sales channels and the significant disruptions to transportation, which dampened market sentiment. Despite various efforts to rally, short selling remained active, keeping the yarn market in a slump. The current market situation is characterized by considerable strength on both the long and short sides. The high price for Double Horse brand 20-count yarn was $1,375, and the low price was $1,337. The initial price in the afternoon was $1,363, which then fell to $1,346. The final price was $1,351. Today's exports included 1,260 bales of cotton yarn to Hong Kong.

Double Horse brand opened with a high price because the off-market trading had rebounded on the previous day, which helped to support market sentiment. The initial price was $1,375, but it gradually declined as buyers were not enthusiastic. At the same time, sales to customers were as stagnant as ever, causing the price to fall to $1,360. However, the slightly weaker exchange rate and the stable margin deposit temporarily improved market sentiment. Unexpectedly, the mixed yarn market stalled, causing a significant weakening, which prompted some to liquidate their Double Horse brand holdings. The market price gradually declined to $1,337. Afterwards, profit-takers covered their short positions, causing the price to recover to $1,358 at the close of trading. The total trading volume for half a day was 10,065 bales. The amount traded by each group is listed below:

Ningbo 10 bales
Same Trade 10 bales

Inland 10 bales
Statistics 10,065

Hong Kong 45

### Cotton Market is Stagnant and Difficult

The current cotton situation is increasingly unfavorable. This is due to the prevailing view that yarn sales are weak and that factory demand is stagnant, which makes the market extremely sluggish.

The New York cotton market was quiet but firm due to buying by fellow traders and good cotton fabric trading conditions. As a result, the closing price was approximately one or two points higher than the previous day.

Indian cotton was flat and weak. It initially rose due to speculative buying and then fell back due to long profit-taking. Yesterday, projections were about one rupee lower.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading remains in a hesitant and stagnant state. There are only occasional sporadic transactions, providing little activity.

### Piece Goods: Fine Cloth is Searched for Cash and Arbitraged

Factory Cloth: The market trend was stable yesterday, and market prices fluctuated. This was because the Guangdong merchants were less enthusiastic and resold some of their purchased goods. However, fellow traders and hoarders mostly maintained their positions, so the decline has slowed. The market even showed a slight rebound later. Fugui fine cloth opened with a decline of 2.5 jiao (25 cents), selling at $42. It continued to fall another 2.5 jiao at noon, but then rebounded 2.5 cents later. The price of coarse cloth and twill also softened slightly. The price of bleached and dyed cloth remained unchanged. Approximately 200 pieces of various cloths were traded in the market. The Zhejiang and Wen-Yong merchants handled 70-80 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, and fine cloth. The Fujian merchants handled nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The Northern merchants (from Yantai and Tianjin) handled 50-60 pieces of poplin, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. Today, 320 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: The market initially declined and then rebounded. As a result, the spot price of fine cloth continued to fall by 5 to 7.5 jiao per piece, while the closing price for this month's Lung Tou (龙 头) futures on the exchange remained at $46 jiao (角), the same as the previous day. The minimum price for Lung Tou warehouse receipts in the market fell to $44.3 jiao. In the afternoon, market sentiment improved, and speculators searched for spot goods for arbitrage, gradually raising the price to $45.65 jiao. Four Gentlemen serge remained relatively firm, falling to a small amount of $1.275, with more buying than selling. It rebounded to close at $1.295.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Raw Oil Rises Another Three Dollars; All Miscellaneous Grains Rise

Yesterday's market for miscellaneous grains, oil, and soybean cake, except for soybean cake, which saw a solitary decline of two to three jiao, continued to see rampant price increases due to hoarding and buying by hoarders. The market was like a bouncing ball, with fierce competition between buyers and sellers. As a result, corn became more active, red sorghum rose by three jiao, soybeans frequently rose by half a dollar, raw oil rose another three dollars, and soybean oil rose by about one dollar.

### Coal: Kailuan Bituminous Coal is in High Demand

### Potatoes
— Gao Chuang Nong

Among the several plants that spread from the New World to the whole world - we have already discussed tobacco and cinchona - the potato is the most beneficial to humans. Its native land is Chile and Peru in South America, and it originally included more than forty species. Today, people can still encounter its wild companions in its homeland. When Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish explorer, led a group of crude and ignorant soldiers and merchants to land in the ancient Inca Empire - now Peru - in 1531 AD, they encountered this sweet-tasting tuberous plant everywhere, which is the potato, and also the sweet potato. However, sweet potatoes grew everywhere in the hot plains and fertile fields, while potatoes only thrived in the cold-temperate mountainous areas. Those uneducated Spaniards wantonly ravaged and destroyed the civilization of the ancient Inca Empire, but when they saw the nutrient-rich tuberous plants, they couldn't help but soften their hearts and "spare them". A man named POiega de Leon, who served under Pizarro, lived in Peru for seventeen years, and also wrote the chronicle of Peru, first recorded the traces of potatoes in 1550, calling its name Papas, and many people later used this name. As for its Latin scientific name, Solanum tuberosum, and its French name "Pomme de terre" (earth apple), it was only in 1716 that an ordinary engineer named Prezier traveled to South America and wrote a travelogue of Chile and Peru that he first used to call it by these names. Unexpectedly, it has become widely used in France. Our country calls it potato, of course because its shape resembles a horse bell, and there are also names such as foreign yam and yam, which are local dialects. (To be continued)

### Today is International Women's Day: Women's Day Encourages Loyalty; Declaration Issued Clarifying Great Significance; Continue Promoting Savings Donation Campaign

Today is "March 8" International Women's Day. The women of Shanghai, recognizing the great responsibilities of women in the era of resistance and nation-building, are unanimously focusing on military spirit and encouraging diligent work in their respective positions. Ideologically, they are adhering to the spirit of the New Life Movement's principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor. In action, they are fulfilling the national oath stipulated in the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, working hard, and persevering to strive for the freedom and equality of the entire nation and to achieve the goal of women's liberation. They will continue to promote savings donations, which will be submitted to the authorities for distribution to various comfort stations. Today, in addition to holding simple gatherings to celebrate, women's groups have decided to jointly send a telegram to the highest leader and the front lines, representing two million women in the city, to express their sincere respect. It is also heard that a certain women's group here is launching preparations for a women's library today to commemorate this year's victorious "March 8" Women's Day, which is of great significance. The declaration issued by the women of this city is recorded below, with particular attention to its essential points.

Spiritual Commemoration: Great Festival

Dear sisters, the glorious "March 8" anniversary of the world has arrived again today. We are on an isolated island shrouded in the forces of darkness. For this personal and great anniversary, we cannot shout a slogan, post a banner, hold a parade, or hold a grand meeting. This is not because we have forgotten this anniversary with great practical significance, but because we are being suppressed and are temporarily suspending it in form. However, our spirit is always connected and commemorated with the national policy of resistance and nation-building.

Women's Movement Work: Heavy Responsibilities

In the prelude to "March 8," the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang instructed in a broadcast address that "promoting the women's movement" is one of the main tasks of this year. Due to the emphasis on women's work by wise leaders, we feel the weight of our responsibilities even more. Because of the harshness of the environment, we cannot take action today, but we should be more vigilant in spirit.

Maintain Purity: Eliminate Extravagance

This year is the year of victory. We see that the great cause of resistance and nation-building is about to be completed. However, in the dark period before dawn, we must vigorously implement the following five principles: (1) Develop a pure character. No matter how harsh the environment, we must always adhere to the ambition of "not being corrupted by wealth and honor, not being moved by poverty and meanness, and not being subdued by force," and maintain our pure character of "emerging from the mud without being stained." (2) Eliminate extravagant customs. We should cancel unnecessary gifts, unnecessary banquets, and all expenses exceeding the necessities of life, and use them for various donations and to help refugees.

Improve Knowledge: Strive for Production

(3) Improve the level of knowledge. Students should certainly do this, but housewives and working women should also collect spiritual food in various ways in addition to housework and business to improve their level of knowledge. (4) Cultivate self-reliant habits. We should not be greedy for comfort and avoid work or give up work. We must become a working woman in society and a responsible member of the family.

Strive for the Future: Glorious Position

(5) Strive for a glorious position. Since the beginning of the war, women across the country have directly and indirectly endured many sacrifices and participated in many jobs in the front and rear. On this "March 8" festival, which welcomes victory, we must work harder and strive for a permanent and glorious position in the future with our achievements.

The Nation First, the People First

In short, we feel that this year's "March 8" festival has a particularly great significance, because we already see the dawn of hope shining before our eyes. However, we must recognize that the "March 8" International Women's Day is a festival to strive for women's liberation. To strive for women's liberation, we must first strive for the liberation of the nation and the country. Therefore, we should unite under the goal of putting the nation and the country first, and work hard to strive for victory in the war of resistance and national liberation.

Destroying Unity: Strike Hard

Moreover, we must also recognize that today, when the final victory is about to come, there are still some degenerates who are willing to destroy unity at all costs. Relying on international background, they directly and indirectly aid evildoers, or betray the resistance in the middle. We women should give these national sinners the most powerful blows, uphold the government's wise policy on rectifying military discipline, and eliminate the international supreme doctrine and peaceful fallacies of riding-the-fence nationals. In this way, we can achieve the great cause of resistance and gain women's liberation.

### Salvation Army Donations to Reach 200,000

The Salvation Army’s commander, Mr. Ma Lishi (马立师), stated that up until yesterday donations had reached around 182,000 National Currency (国币). It is estimated to reach 200,000 soon. It has been reported that an enthusiastic Chinese Merchant donated 10,000 alone. Those who wish to donate may send their donation of any amount to The Salvation Army Headquarters at 40 Nanjing Road, Sassoon House (沙逊大楼). All donations of any amount are welcome.

### Replacement of Second High Court President After Kidnapping, Guo Yun-guan Temporarily Assumes Position.

Xu Weizhen (徐维震), President of the Second Jiangsu High Court, was kidnapped on the afternoon of the fourth of this month after finishing court business. He and his wife were riding in the same car to return to their residence in the Yang family’s public housing on Hualong Road (华龙路), when they were ambushed by thugs hiding in front of their residence. There has been no news since. After this incident, the court has continued to operate normally and has requested instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration (司法行政部). The Court has now received a ministry order to temporarily appoint Guo Yun-guan (郭云观), President of the First Special District (第一特区) District Court, as the acting Court President. Security around the court has been tightened. Security around the First Special District (第一特区) Court has also not been loosened.

### Anglo-American-Australian-Dutch Concentration of Forces to Defend the Entire South Seas: Breaking Political Barriers to Unite Naval and Air Power; Joint Defense by the Four Countries Sufficient to Resist Any Aggression

Tension is mounting in the Pacific, and the evolution of the situation is noteworthy. However, those who play with fire will eventually burn themselves. As aggressors desperately attempt to advance southward, a new group of nations comprising the United States, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands has formed. If Japan attempts to advance southward, it will not encounter the Dutch East Indies, Australia, or the United States individually, but rather a strong, integrated group of these four countries. Foreign observers here have conducted thorough research on the Pacific situation.

America Actually Occupies a Leading Position

It is generally said that after the capitulation of France, the main Pacific powers are only Britain, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands. Britain, due to its involvement in the European war, is unable to dedicate its main forces to the Far East. However, Australia and Britain are essentially one entity, and Australia, in terms of both economy and military, remains an important factor in the current Pacific situation. The Netherlands is willing to fully cooperate with Britain. However, the United States takes the lead, for both spiritual and material reasons, the fate of the United States is inextricably linked to the Pacific.

Moral Rights and Interests Must Be Safeguarded

In short, the United States, in material terms, needs tin, rubber, and other minerals produced in Asia. In commercial terms, the United States has over $500 million in annual trade and tens of millions of dollars in investments in South Asia. Politically, the United States still bears the obligation to protect the interests of its Far Eastern nationals and the 16 million people of the Philippines. Spiritually, it cannot abandon its moral responsibilities under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. At present, America's first line of defense is the British Navy in Europe, and in the Far East, it is China's war effort. Therefore, assistance to Britain and China will be provided with full force. Once the Lend-Lease Act is passed, America's assistance to China and Britain will become even more earnest. The notion that the United States will retreat if something happens in the Pacific is impossible.

Britain, America, Australia, and the Netherlands: One Group

Now, the pressure from aggressive forces in the Pacific is intensifying, and the situation is becoming more critical, leading Britain, America, Australia, and the Netherlands to converge into a group, forming an unbreakable fortress. This eliminates the entire political region of the South Seas. Strategically, the South Seas stretch from Hong Kong in the north to Australia and New Zealand in the south, from Cavite in Manila in the east to Singapore in the west, including Surabaya in Java, Tanjung Priok in Batavia, and other ports. This vast area will support each other and form a mutually reinforcing defense.

Naval Strength Is Exceptionally Strong

The United States is now consulting on the use of naval bases in the Americas and New Zealand, and it is possible that Singapore will be further utilized in the future. The United States recently reorganized its navy, and the Far East Fleet stands alone, with the potential for expansion. The dispatch of ships from Hawaii to the Philippines by the United States is also a precautionary measure. The Dutch East Indies currently has three cruisers, eight destroyers, a squadron of submarines, and eight mine-laying and mine-sweeping vessels each, as well as 1,000 aircraft. If the situation in the Mediterranean improves, Britain may well transfer part of its fleet to the east.

Air Power Is Not to Be Ignored

As for the importance of air power, the Philippines alone has over a hundred airfields, and the Dutch East Indies has at least ten or twenty, similar to Malaya. The Philippines also has well-equipped military airfields. The United States Air Force in the Philippines is growing rapidly. Australian air forces have successively flown to Singapore, making Singapore an important air fortress. It is noteworthy that the British Far East Commander-in-Chief, Air Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham, is himself an air force marshal. The combined air power of Britain, America, Australia, and the Netherlands is, in terms of quality and quantity, no less than that of Japan. Even the air power of the Dutch East Indies alone, currently concentrated in Surabaya, purchased 300 aircraft from the United States from 1933 to 1936, imported 318 in 1938, and has nearly 1,200 new aircraft. The Dutch East Indies is only a four-hour sea journey from Singapore, and aircraft can reach it in forty minutes.

If Japan Advances Southward, the Future Is Foreseeable

From this, we can see that joint defense by Britain, America, Australia, and the Netherlands is highly likely. Looking at the overall situation, it can be determined that if the southward advance does not involve armed conflict, that is one thing. But if it rashly resorts to force, it will encounter a new group of countries integrated as one entity: Britain, America, Australia, and the Netherlands. Its clay feet will not withstand a second stumble. Therefore, the so-called southward advance is a matter of committing ritual suicide.

### Czech Expatriates Celebrate the Birthday of the Late Czech President

Three hundred and fifty Czech expatriates in Shanghai held an informal gathering at the YMCA at 214 Avenue Albert last night (the 7th) to commemorate the late President Masaryk of the Czechoslovak Republic. Major Stephen, honorary secretary of the Czech Association, will deliver a speech.

Doctors Strive to Benefit the Country

President Masaryk was born in 1850. Born of humble origins, he embraced a spirit of relentless struggle and eventually became the most beloved figure in the Czech Republic. He served as president from 1918 to 1935 and passed away on September 14, 1937, one year before Germany began its invasion of Czechoslovakia. During the World War, Masaryk traveled extensively to the Allied countries. In the spring of 1918, he also visited China and Japan, staying for several weeks.

### New Pu Yu Tang Continues to Receive Donations

Since the New Pu Yu Tang appealed for relief, people from all walks of life have shown great sympathy and generously donated. Some have made long-term monthly donations and others have helped solicit large donations. Their enthusiasm and perseverance are truly admirable. However, the goal is still far from being reached, and we hope for continued assistance. The donations received yesterday are listed below: Chen Jichen, 300 yuan; Tang Shiyi Pharmacy, Lu Shigeng, 200 yuan each; Xingliu Dinner Party, Cungutang Cao, 100 yuan each; Zhou Shuyi, Hua Yi, Wei Yi, jointly 100 yuan; Lu Renjian, 50 yuan; anonymous, 20 yuan; anonymous, 10 yuan; Gong Shaoping, 6 yuan; Zhang Junhe, San Sheng Tang, 5 yuan each; Fan Qinliang, Fan Qinbin, Fan Qinming, Lu Fanping, Chen Shanxing, Tao Miaofa, 1 yuan each; Zhang Songmin, a set of old cotton-padded clothes. On behalf of the orphans of the hall, we express our gratitude. Donation locations: Catholic Church, Rue du Père Robert, French Concession; Donation collection points: (1) Trust Department of the Silk Industry Bank, 460 Hankou Road; (2) Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, Sassoon House, the Bund; (3) Jihua Hall, 47 Yunnan Road; (4) Huamei Pharmacy, 156 Fuzhou Road; (5) Catholic Church, Rue du Père Robert, French Concession.

### Rice Snatching in the Downtown Area Yesterday Morning: A Large Group of Poor People Snatched Four Bags on Route Doumer

At 8:30 yesterday morning, a certain meter vehicle was transporting eight bags of white rice to a certain location. When the vehicle passed the intersection of Route de Sikawei and Route Doumer, a large group of poor people suddenly blocked the way, cut open the rice bags with small knives, and seized the white rice. The order in the middle of the road was chaotic for a time. The driver was helpless and called for the police. By the time the nearby patrol officers arrived, four bags of white rice had been snatched, and the poor people had scattered. Afterwards, the driver of the vehicle reported the incident to a certain rice shop, which in turn reported it to the police station for investigation.

Improvement of the Rice Market: Bill Yesterday

In order to discuss the stabilization of food for the people, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Food Committee held a full committee meeting at 2:30 yesterday afternoon in the conference room on the first floor of the Shanghai Municipal Council. All members of the committee were present, chaired by Mr. Marshall, and adjourned at 4:00. After the meeting, the reporter from Dazhong News Agency inquired about the details from the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office. Because the bill was still being processed, it could not be released. However, according to general speculation, the committee has made a resolution on various measures to improve the rice market.

Flour Sold at Reduced Prices: To Be Continued Next Week

Regarding the sale of flour at reduced prices, the supply had been suspended since February 18 due to the suspension of work at the Fuxin Factory, resulting in the temporary suspension of the sale of flour at reduced prices. It is now known that after repeated negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Fuxin Factory, the factory has agreed to continue to supply 5.873 bags daily from today (the 8th), with each bag sold at 25 yuan, plus a handling fee of 3 jiao for the flour shop, until 250,000 bags are sold. Although the above-mentioned selling price is slightly higher than before, it is several yuan lower per bag than the current market price. The factory is commended for its enthusiasm for public welfare in order to regulate the flour market by generously agreeing to continue to supply. It is also known that the Fufeng Factory is unable to produce flour due to a shortage of raw materials, so the supply of flour at reduced prices has been temporarily suspended. As for the sale of flour at reduced prices, it can still be resumed starting next week. That is, users can collect flour from their original flour shops on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday each week, according to the amount they should receive (a total of 8.318 bags per day) (no flour will be issued on Wednesday and Sunday). If there is a shortage in the future, it will be supplemented with the amount obtained from the levy on foreign flour. According to the new factory price of 25 yuan per bag for the sale of foreign flour at reduced prices, the price has also been changed to 25 yuan per bag.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Board Approves the Economic Committee Report; Whether or Not to Keep the Orchestra to Be Decided by Taxpayers; Agents in London and New York Temporarily Retained; Expanding Tax Revenue Should Prevent License Holders from Evading Taxes

The final report of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Economic Committee was approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council Board at its meeting on March 5. This report includes an investigation into the expenditures of the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra and the expenditures of agents in London and New York, as well as the activities of the Tax Revenue Subcommittee. The content is as follows:

Whether to Retain the Orchestra

The Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra is one of the cultural undertakings supported by a small amount of municipal funds. After considering the accounts of the orchestra and its budget of 378,540 yuan for the year 1941, we believe that the organization of the orchestra is very economical. If this entertainment is to be continued, this budget cannot be reduced. However, the question of whether this organization is needed is in the hands of the taxpayers. Therefore, we believe that the policy that the Shanghai Municipal Council should adopt is to seek the consent of the taxpayers as to whether the orchestra should be maintained.

Agents' Remuneration

The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently paid close attention to the expenditure of the London agent. Since January 1, 1940, the expenditure of the London agent has been greatly reduced. As things stand, if these agents are not summarily dismissed, their remuneration cannot be further reduced. Because the Shanghai Municipal Council currently has a number of British nationals receiving pensions and a number of British staff, these agents are essential. If the situation changes in the future, the Shanghai Municipal Council may terminate the positions of these London and New York agents.

Expanding Tax Revenue

The activities of the Tax Revenue Subcommittee have been fully outlined in the second short report. This report focuses on the issue of increasing the Shanghai Municipal Council's license fees. We believe that from the fiscal year of 1941, the Shanghai Municipal Council must obtain additional funds. At present, the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax revenue consists of land tax, property tax, advertising tax, license fees, and wharf dues. According to the Subcommittee's investigation, the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax revenue under the Land Regulations is very limited, only the above-mentioned taxes. The Subcommittee will fully review the Shanghai Municipal Council's license fee revenue to ensure that places subject to license fees cannot evade taxes. The cost of the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax collection has been reduced from 3.26% in 1931 to 2.55% in 1940. The Subcommittee has examined the situation of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax Bureau and is satisfied with its effective and economical work.

### Reducing Electricity Supply: Users Should Cooperate; Large Users Should Not Use It as an Excuse to Raise Prices; The Reduction in Electricity Consumption Is Aimed at Preventing Common Losses

Regarding the temporary electricity reduction measures approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council, all parties have praised them. However, the concern is that major factories will use the increase in electricity costs as an excuse to raise prices. Yesterday, the English-language 大美晚报 commented on this matter, issuing a warning to large electricity users. The original text reads:

Small Users: No Increase in Electricity Costs

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, users of the Shanghai Power Company who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month will be required to reduce their electricity consumption by 30% in the future. Any excess will be charged a fee equal to three times the normal rate. This measure is worthy of our approval because it is specifically targeted at large users who can afford the loss and does not intend to place any further burden on small users who are already heavily burdened. Although this measure will cause some inconvenience, if measures are not taken to correct it now, the losses suffered by large users will be greater than what they are currently suffering. However, if large users take advantage of this and shift the blame onto others, raising prices and causing losses to the final consumer, the purpose of the Shanghai Municipal Council's move will be defeated. For the above reasons, we hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council is confident that the residents of the International Settlement will be able to cooperate with it. At the same time, if anyone dares to disregard the overall welfare of the Settlement and refuses to cooperate with this initiative aimed at the welfare of all residents, we will all abandon them.

The Impact After the Electricity Reduction

According to industrial sources, after the Shanghai Municipal Council implemented the electricity reduction measures, most industries in the city, with the exception of a very few, were greatly affected. Among those most affected were the Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai. According to past surveys, Japanese factories consume approximately 250 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, accounting for about half of the total electricity supply of the Shanghai Power Company. Although the Japanese side has complained about the significant impact of this measure on Japanese industries, it is generally believed that the Japanese side will not make strong protests. Industrial sources in the city firmly believe that the implementation of this new measure will inevitably lead to some adjustments in the production procedures and labor relations of various factories.

### The 謀福 Steamer Was Detained

The 謀福 steamer of the German firm 禮和洋行 had been suspended for a long time due to the interruption of the Shanghai-Zhejiang route. It recently departed from Shanghai on the 日 of this month and set sail for Fuqing. Unexpectedly, it was stopped by Japanese warships in the waters of the estuary, prohibiting entry. According to the shipping department of the 謀福 steamer, the ship was detained on the 5th of this month and has not been released for three days. It has now been reported to the German Consulate to make representations. It is also understood that the ship was carrying only cargo and no passengers.

### Wu Xiaoan Was Kidnapped in Front of the Eve Ball Room; Two Kidnappers Threatened with Handguns; The Police Are Investigating, but Have Not Yet Found Any Trace

Yesterday morning at around 4:00, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred in front of the Eve Ball Room on Route Ghisi, Shanghai. The kidnapped person was Wu Xiaoan. Two kidnappers forced Wu into a car and drove west.

The Kidnapping Circumstances

Wu Xiaoan lives in Room A-12, Washington Apartments, 233 Avenue Pétain, French Concession, with his wife and sister. He owns a private car with a French Concession license number of 11150. Recently, his original driver was ill and on leave, so Wu drove the car himself. The night before, it was his friend's birthday, so he and his sister and friends took his private car to the Eve Nightclub at 1238 Rue du Consulat to celebrate with a banquet and dance. At around 4:00 yesterday morning, they were returning after the festivities. Just as he opened the car door and stepped into the car, two kidnappers who had been lying in wait beside the car suddenly pulled out handguns and threatened Wu's friend and sister, ordering them to get out of the car. They forced Wu into the car and the kidnappers drove it west.

No Trace Yet

Afterwards, his sister and his friends witnessed the situation and were helpless. They went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report the incident. The police immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives in police cars to the scene to investigate and ordered street police to pay attention to the whereabouts of the car. However, as of last night, Wu's residence had not received any news from Wu, and the car had not been found. The police are making every effort to investigate this kidnapping case.

### Japanese Military Vehicle Speeding: Another Life Lost

At around 2:00 yesterday afternoon, several Japanese military trucks were speeding back and forth along North Szechuen Road and the Suzhou Creek area, patrolling. At that time, a peddler selling oranges was carrying a load of fresh oranges on his shoulder, just coming south from North Szechuen Road. At that time, the trucks were driving at extremely high speed. The peddler, due to the heavy load, was unable to avoid them in time and was knocked down by the speeding Japanese military truck. His brains splattered on the spot. Before he could be sent to the hospital for treatment, he died. The vehicle that caused the accident drove away at full speed towards Hongkou.

### British Far East Information Officer Scott Arrives in Shanghai: British Embassy Hosts a Welcome Dinner

Mr. Scott, the Far East Information Officer of the British Ministry of Information, arrived in Shanghai by ship from Singapore a few days ago. A reporter from 平明社 learned from the British Embassy office here yesterday that Alexander, the information officer at the British Embassy, hosted a welcome dinner for Mr. Scott at his residence on Haig Road the night before. It is understood that Mr. Scott came to Shanghai to inspect the British wartime information work in various parts of the Far East and to provide instructions on information matters in Shanghai. He will stay for a few days before leaving Shanghai for other places.

### Rong Wu Society to Lecture on Sutras Tomorrow

The Rong Wu Sutra Lecture Society will hold a sutra lecture at the Pudong Daming on Route Edward VII at 4:00 tomorrow afternoon, the 9th of this month. Listeners are requested to arrive on time.

### Coal Briquette Industry Association Meeting: No Increase in Selling Prices

According to sources, the rumour yesterday that the coal briquette industry had decided to increase selling prices is incorrect. The Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association did not convene a meeting to increase coal briquette selling prices. This was a decision made privately by coal merchants who were blinded by greed, which is illegal.

### National Physician Chen Susheng to Lecture on Stroke Experience

The 漢未 Public Announcement at 190 Beijing Road in this city has invited the famous Shanghai national physician Chen Susheng to lecture on stroke experience at the Xinsheng Radio Station on Nanjing Road at 7:20 this afternoon. Those suffering from high blood pressure who lack knowledge of health preservation can tune in at that time. Dr. Chen's knowledge and experience are extremely rich, and since the start of the lectures, the audience has been enthusiastic.

### Flying Eagle Car Exhibition

The Williams Flying Eagle car has a wheelbase of 104 inches and a body length of 181 inches. It is beautiful, comfortable, and drives and operates like a large car, but its operating costs are as economical as a small car. Since its launch, it has been recognized as the latest contribution of the American automobile industry in 1941. It has now been brought to Shanghai by the local distributor, Maddie Motors Company, and will be on display today at the company's showroom at 640 Avenue Foch, open to the public for viewing.

### Lost Child Picked Up

A boy named Li Asan, six years old, from Ningbo, was playing on the street the other day and got lost. The patrol officer found that the child has large eyes and thick eyebrows and is wearing a red cloth jacket. He is now being held in the Children's Welfare Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Room 605, waiting to be claimed. Those who recognize him can go to contact them at 9:00 every morning.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 yesterday afternoon stated that Shandong is quite cold, with fog and north-west to northerly winds. This area and the coastal area south of Ma'an Island are cloudy, quite cold, with fog and north-west to north-east winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 yesterday afternoon, the temperature in this city was 59.4 degrees at its highest and 45.1 degrees at its lowest. On the same day last year, the highest was 59.2 degrees and the lowest was 41.9 degrees.

### Another Chinese Constable's Gun Robbed: Will Be Severely Punished; Four Robbers Intercepted a Pedestrian and Robbed a Constable's Gun Yesterday Morning; The Constable Will Be Severely Reprimanded for Not Resisting the Robbers

According to the English-language 大美晚报, at 9:00 this morning (the 7th), a pedestrian named 甲 was suddenly intercepted by four armed robbers at the intersection of Hankou Road and Hubei Road. Unable to resist, he was robbed of 866 yuan in cash. 甲 then reported the incident to a certain Chinese constable on duty nearby. Unexpectedly, the four robbers followed and, seeing 甲 talking to the Chinese constable, rushed forward and surrounded the Chinese constable, robbing him of his service handgun before fleeing. It is reported that, according to the order issued last year by the Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, the Chinese constable will be suspended from duty and pay for not resisting the robbers and allowing his handgun to be robbed. According to the police chief's order, issued last year due to repeated incidents of Chinese constables in the Western District having their service handguns robbed, all Chinese constables who lose their guns will be suspended from duty until the handgun is recovered and must be interrogated, detailing the circumstances under which the handgun was robbed.

### The Impact of Pain on Society

Pain sometimes gives us a lot of trouble. When we have a little pain, we may have to make difficult decisions, suffer serious losses in our business, and be unable to express our opinions at meetings. As for social circles, it is even more damaging. When making appointments, we have to cancel them at the last minute.

It is also difficult to stay at home in the end. If a patient suffers from menstrual pain, then family life is full of pain. The children are unruly, and when the husband comes home, he sees his wife lying in bed, showing annoyance on her face. Therefore, pain is enough to affect our physical health, and indirectly it also affects the safety of the entire society.

However, we do not have to endure pain, because as long as we take one or two 快剃痛 tablets, the pain will stop within ten minutes. It is safe, and no matter which individual has which pain, 快剃痛 powder is the best choice.

### The Deaf Father

— Xie Yilong

To support a family of over ten people as someone who didn't graduate from middle school and became deaf early in life – that's my father.

We have eight siblings, eight hungry mouths, drinking my father's lifeblood every day. My father became deaf at the age of twenty, supposedly because he worked too hard. Indeed, at that time, he was an apprentice at a bank during the day and had to attend night school and write manuscripts in the evening, accumulating over time and exchanging his hearing for knowledge and livelihood. He heard my strong cries when I was born, but he couldn't hear my soft babbling as I learned to speak.

My father became deaf, but he never lost heart. He is an optimistic person with a strong will. Deafness further determined his future; he was able to focus on his career and pursuit of knowledge by cutting off external disturbances. With his usual character and reputation, he not only didn't lose his job because of his deafness, but also gained people's trust through caution and care.

He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, and he doesn't go to theaters or dance halls (deafness significantly affected his entertainment). On holidays, he likes to take Mom and us to restaurants for dim sum, and libraries and parks are his only recreational places.

For thirty years, from when I was the only child to becoming the eldest brother of eight siblings, I don't need to tell you about my father's hard work. When people praised us in front of my father, his smile warmed the hearts of us brothers. Five of us brothers are studying, and the youngest is still breastfeeding, all expenses borne by my father alone. But when he saw our report cards, he always forgot about the huge tuition fees he paid with joy.

My father always has bright expectations and happy ideals. He's only forty years old, although he looks a little older. But he is already the father of eight children who only know how to enjoy.

The wrinkles on my father's face are the marks of our siblings' lives. We grow every year, and my father's wrinkles increase every year. But he doesn't think of himself as old; his forward-looking and upward-striving heart is more eager than that of young people.

My father doesn't like to talk much, nor does he often scold us. But we don't have spoiled siblings. Each person is a role model for another, each person is another's sibling, so the atmosphere in the family is always so harmonious.

My father is very kind to others. All the neighbors praise him, and his colleagues are also happy to help him. He tells us, "Humility will never harm us."

My father often tells us that if he didn't have so many children, his wealth would be considerable. He could have cars and villas. This is his lament. He values us more than wealth. He often strokes the heads of the younger siblings and says, "Children, you are my only wealth, my only hope."

My father is very frugal with himself, but he rarely refuses our requests. He often says to Mom, "Don't constantly discourage the children's desires."

I am twenty years old, and when I think about how my father was already supporting Mom and me by his own efforts twenty years ago, I feel too ashamed. Besides the tears of self-blame, I silently wish my father good health here.

Education

### In Defense of Education

— San

The track and field teacher felt that "this so-called education should go to the grave to rest" because the students in his school didn't maintain order in the library. Many people who read this article are worried about education—especially the old men who can never see the truth. My uncle said to me like this: "Humph, this kind of education is really worthless!"

Actually, should education "go to the grave to rest"? I think this kind of lament is superfluous.

Yes, nine out of ten libraries in Shanghai universities are no less noisy than tea rooms. But this cannot be said to be the failure of education itself; this is the failure of educators! Look, isn't the hardworking spirit of students in Free China a good proof for us? Many newspapers and magazines publish articles about the living conditions of students in Free China, which clearly tell us that education has not failed, just like science itself is not guilty; the only thing that has failed is the educator.

The track and field teacher also gave a counter-example, saying, "Some public libraries—where the readers are mostly small clerks who haven't even entered middle school—are very quiet." This inevitably makes people feel that the track and field teacher's thinking is too simple. Can it be said that small clerks who haven't even entered middle school haven't received an education? Does "receiving education" necessarily have to be signaled by a bell, in a classroom, taught chapter by chapter by a professor? Isn't their quiet reading itself receiving education? Doesn't the track and field teacher know that society is also a university? It must be known that anything that only emphasizes form and not substance is most undesirable, especially education. It's no wonder that the track and field teacher laments "this so-called education" when he emphasizes form so much.

The value of education cannot be measured. Unfavorable phenomena produced under special circumstances cannot bury the entire education, just as we cannot conclude that humans are barbaric animals because of the killing and arson of invaders.

Life

### Life's Great Discount

— Fang

I occasionally flipped through my old diary—this is a painful record, an account of life's payments—and saw the words written on the last page:

"Life is like a榨床 (oil press), and like a stone mill, pressing my life into渣滓 (dregs), grinding my health into 奮粉 (powder). The painful endurance has reached a saturation point! But how many times have I said the old tune that pain has reached its peak and can no longer be endured? However, the result is like a great discount in a store, saying that it will not be extended, but the result is still an extension. But store discounts are mostly false, while my life's discount is a real sacrifice of capital. Closing the store is only a matter of time! In the repeatedly extended great discount period before closing the store, flowing the remaining capital is really too miserable! I also know that it's not worth it to close the door only after the capital is exhausted. Since the door is going to close sooner or later, why not close the door of life as soon as possible? But my original desire to survive is struggling, it tremblingly shelters the broken and remnant life, refusing to submit. So I have to continue my life's great discount, letting it flow out the last drop of blood!"

Crimson blood seemed to be flowing before my eyes, and my numb heart suddenly felt a shock! This is the lament of my life! How cruel and ashamed I am! I can't protect my own life, and I still want to be my own executioner! Animals have an innate instinct for self-defense, and humans are even more intelligent animals: although you have lost your health, and therefore cannot take the more convenient path of self-defense, you can use your wisdom, exert your spiritual power, tortuously and arduously to achieve your purpose of self-defense. You have to fight, you can't let your blood continue to flow away, you should protect your own life, this is your great duty, and it is also for the sake of humanity!

"Humanity is to be earned, cultivated, and maintained by each person's efforts, not given or donated by others." Remember! This is the dying words of the cultural warrior Lu Xun. (Royalties donated to Xin Puyu Hall)

(4) An Unexpected Encounter

"Very well, would you please wait for me for four or five minutes, Madam?" Qiu Haitang immediately took an active pencil from the hem of his gray gown, tore off two pages of white paper from his diary, and immediately leaned over a round table and began to write.

In no more than six or seven minutes, a very clear and concise record was in Xiangqi's hands; but it took her more than ten minutes to read it. She read it several times, trying to find some errors in the writing or calligraphy, but the result was exactly the opposite. She just felt that the sentence structure was good, the calligraphy was good, and everything was simply good!

"This opera singer is really strange!" She thought to herself. She couldn't help but glance at him, but unfortunately, Qiu Haitang, who had always been the most self-controlled, was also a little abnormal today, and just happened to be sneaking a sidelong glance at her; as soon as their eyes met, an electrical-like reaction occurred, and both heads involuntarily lowered.

"..." Qiu Haitang wanted to say a few more polite words, but he couldn't say anything at all.

"Okay, let's do it this way!" Xiangqi maintained a very dignified attitude throughout, slowly getting up from the chair, indicating that the conversation was over.

"Then, Madam, may I ask when we can come to hear your reply?" Zhao Si asked without delay.

"Tomorrow afternoon," Xiangqi looked only at Haitang and said, "Please come here again, and I believe I can give you a satisfactory answer."

When Qiu Haitang walked out of the Yuan's house with Zhao Si, he felt very confused, even more confused than before he came. He didn't say a word to Zhao on the way.

"Now we don't have to worry anymore!" Zhao Si couldn't figure out why he was more worried than before the others agreed to help him, so he tried to comfort him. "Listening to Madam Yuan, we will definitely not suffer any more losses. At most, we will give Shen Maazi a few dollars for medical expenses. Don't be afraid of him being fierce!"

Qiu Haitang crossed down from the rickshaw silently, as if he hadn't heard, and walked into the hotel; the shadow of a woman had unprecedentedly occupied his entire brain. (49)

### Lamarr Determined to Abandon Saloons

— Qinghui

"The Pain Bestowed on Her by the Queen of the Beast Kingdom"

Dorothy Lamour was indignant, but she didn't throw anything away. Like a lioness, she glared angrily. At first, it was slow, her eyes shone, and she inhaled her cigarette in succession, one puff, two puffs, three puffs. Finally, in the hazy smoke, she poured out:

"When I stepped into Hollywood, wanting to act in gentle and elegant dramas, in my mind I only imagined the decadent night parties, heated rooms, and a pleasant mood in the corner of the film set. But what did I get? I got the horns of the 'Queen of the Beast Kingdom', sitting on the ground in a tent shared by many people, for eight consecutive days in the icy mountain stream. This is the hospitality Hollywood gave me! Every day, I was covered in paint, giving me that beautiful sun-kissed skin. When I returned to the tent at night, all the other extras had arrived before me, so I couldn't get any hot water all day, and I got oil paint poisoning, suffering from alternating chills and fever, and lying in the hospital for a long time.

"Due to the audience's request, I was again arranged to play in 'Moku Lovebirds', even though my body temperature was as high as 103 degrees, I still had to swim. Finally, I fainted. But I still suffered continuous pain, and I didn't know I was injured until the doctor examined me! According to the doctor's report: my injuries were terrible, most of them were sunburns, five places were bitten by orangutans, and there were scratches from lions, tigers, and leopards on my back, three cases of colds, three sprains, twenty-one chills and fevers, and many minor injuries.

"When filming 'Water and Fire Island', it was the most terrible scene of my life." Lamour took a puff of her cigarette and continued, "I was standing there concentrating, and the orangutan I was working with suddenly got angry. It jumped down from a branch thirty feet above the ground and landed on my back, as if struck by lightning. I fell to the ground, and it kicked my waist and raised its giant palm, starting to pound on my chest. Even today, every time I take a deep breath, I feel a slight pain!"

"In the film 'Storm Robbery', I was the target of millions of gallons of water, fanned by wind machines, and washed down from a sixty-foot-high waterfall. Of course, I got a very bad chill. Not only that, but they also turned twenty-five wind machines towards me, which was indescribably embarrassing. I almost lost consciousness. 'Burmese Romance' also gave me many unprecedented hardships. The most terrible thing was that I had to kill a poisonous snake. According to the script, I had to wrap the snake in my dress and then press it to death, like wringing clothes when washing them."

Miss Lamour said wearily and sighed to the sky: "Ah! The fact that I can still live in this world today is all thanks to God's blessing!"

(Translator's Note: According to Hollywood news, after acting in "Burmese Romance", Lamour requested to abandon saloons forever and refused to act in beast movies. However, Paramount recently gave Lamour a new script in which Lamour is still a wild girl who has to fight with beasts. Upon hearing the news, Lamour even burst into tears. She discussed it with her legal counsel, Bauer, and although Bauer spoke softly and kindly, Lamour's determination to refuse the role was firm. What will happen in the future? Let's listen to the next episode.)

### Ginger Rogers Wins Golden Statue Award; Shanghai Radio Film Corporation Hosts Celebration Banquet

— Li Baolin

The night before yesterday (the 3rd), there was a lively gathering of Shanghai film industry personnel at the Yihong Restaurant on Nanjing Road. It was a special dinner hosted by Mr. Crowter, the person in charge of the Hollywood Radio Pictures Corporation's Shanghai office, to celebrate Ginger Rogers' receipt of last year's Golden Statue Award.

Crowter invited well-known figures from the Shanghai press and film industries. According to him, Rogers' new film, *Kitty Foyle*, has arrived in Shanghai and will be released in Shanghai next month. The film's story is adapted from Christopher Morley's original work. Before filming, Radio Pictures Corporation treated it with a very solemn attitude, and they hesitated and considered for several months before deciding on the leading actress. But in the end, they decided to cast Ginger Rogers because she had changed her style and achieved great success after splitting with Fred Astaire. Taking last year's *Bachelor Mother* as an example, she received very high praise.

After receiving the news that Ginger Rogers had won the Golden Statue Award, the Shanghai Radio Pictures Corporation held a celebration. During the celebration, they also screened the company's recent productions and cartoon shorts. It is said that Li Diyun and Mr. Pan, managers of the Grand Theatre, and senior personnel such as Mr. Butler of the Asia Theatre Company, all attended the meeting.

### Blood Rain in the Qiong Garden

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter One: Where in Life Do We Not Meet

The villager said it was in the small river ahead, so I asked him to guide me to have a look. Thus, I lit a lantern and walked towards the riverbank ahead. When I got there, there was only the gurgling of the river and the sound of the wild wind blowing through the trees. The villager pointed his hand towards the river water about ten steps ahead and said, "Do you see that white light shining from there?" I followed his hand and looked, and indeed there was a faint white light rising from the surface of the water into the sky, even brighter, and constantly appearing to be about to leap. The villager and I stood by the water, watching for a long time, and the white light gradually faded, as faint as a wisp of silk, almost invisible. So we returned to the house. The villager said to me, "I'm afraid this is the spirit of gold and silver, which is why such a white light appeared." I laughed and asked, "Since there is gold and silver in the river, why don't you dredge it?" He said that they were afraid. I smiled and went to sleep. But I thought there must be treasure in the river, and this opportunity should not be missed. So the next day, I asked him to find a few villagers to come with digging tools and we went to the riverbank together. The river water was not very deep, so I taught them to scoop out the water first, dam the upstream, and then start digging. They also thought that there was gold and silver to be obtained, and happily obeyed. After digging for a short time, a villager suddenly felt something in his hand and quickly jumped up to show me. It turned out to be the treasured sword. I then thought of the story of the sword spirit of Fengcheng in ancient times. Although I am not Lei Huan, I am fortunate to have obtained the Frost Blade. Then the white light I saw at night was probably this object. When the villagers dug down again, they found nothing else, and walked up dejectedly saying, "Where is there any gold or silver? There's only this ancient sword. What good is it?" I was secretly delighted in my heart, so I rewarded them with a few taels of silver, took the sword home, fitted it with a scabbard, and practiced with it in my spare time. It was very handy. Wasn't this a matter of chance?" Zhang Cangqiu said, "A treasured sword is hard to come by, and you obtained it so easily. Although it was by chance, it is to be congratulated. Since I have seen your treasured sword, how about I show you mine?" As he spoke, he returned the Scarlet Wind Sword to Xu Jing's hand. He also drew the treasured sword he was wearing, its light shining like frost, its aura like a clear breeze, and held it with both hands for Xu Jing to see, saying, "This sword is named Lingbao. It was made by Cao Pi of Wei and has a considerable history. I got it from a wandering monk." Xu Jing looked at it and also said, "Good sword, good sword." One held a treasured sword, the other held a treasured blade, their light shining brightly on the four walls. As they were admiring them, at the same time, there were two sharp gazes from outside the bamboo fence, shooting towards the window, but neither of them noticed. (End of Chapter One)

### The Philosophy of a Striving Life

— Zong Yu

Don't blame the current environment for being ruthless to you; only blame your striving power for being too insufficient. If you can constantly strive and constantly increase your strength, you will one day achieve your desire to create a new environment. Why complain to heaven and blame others!
