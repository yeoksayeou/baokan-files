### Nazi Eastern Invasion Encounters Strong Enemy - Soviet Army Counter-Offensive Achieves Victory - 300 German Tanks Destroyed by Artillery Fire - Brest and Three Other Cities Occupied by Germans

TASS, Moscow, 23rd - A public announcement made today by the Red Army General Headquarters on June 23rd is as follows:

"During the day, the enemy army attempted to invade the entire defense line from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, concentrating its main force to attack in the directions of Shanalai, Kaunas, Gordnovelkovysk, Kobri, Vladimir-Volynsk, Ravarusska, and Broany. However, they did not succeed. The enemy forces attacking in the Vladimir-Volynsk and Broany directions have been repelled with heavy losses. The enemy forces in the Shalai and Ravarusska directions briefly broke into our territory in the morning, but were defeated and driven out of the defense line by our counter-attack in the afternoon. In the Shalai area, 300 enemy tanks were destroyed by our artillery fire. After fierce fighting in the areas of Bialystok and Brest, the enemy forced our smoke units to retreat and occupied Kolo, Lomsha, and Brest. Our air defense forces successfully protected troops, densely populated areas, and military targets from enemy air raids, and assisted our land army in counter-attacks. During the day, our aircraft and anti-aircraft guns shot down 51 enemy aircraft within our territory and forced another one to land at the Minsk airfield. From June 22nd to 23rd, Soviet troops captured 5,000 German officers and soldiers. The Red Army General Headquarters stated that 65 enemy aircraft were shot down on June 22nd, but a more accurate count shows that the actual number was 76."

Reuters, London, 24th - Although the main forces of the Soviet Union have not yet joined the battle, it is reported that bloody battles have occurred in many places along the 2,000-mile front line stretching from the Black Sea to Finland. What we have learned with certainty from the scarce and contradictory battle reports is that: (1) the Soviet Union has lost Brest-Litovsk (on the east bank of the Bug River), Lomsha (20 miles south of the East Prussian border and 10 miles from the Sasa River, which is the boundary of the Polish territory occupied by the Nazis and the Soviet Union), Kolo (5 miles south of East Prussia), and Kunlian; (2) the German army has not yet encountered the main force of the Red Army; (3) the German air force has encountered fierce resistance. A Berlin radio broadcast reported that the German army's attack on Brest-Litovsk was completely unexpected by the Soviet army, and they did not have time to destroy the main bridge over the city's river before it was occupied by the German army.

Reuters, New York, 24th - According to a Moscow dispatch published by the National Broadcasting Company, the Soviet government has acknowledged the fall of the town of Brest-Litovsk.

Reuters, New York, 24th - A dispatch from Ankara by the National Broadcasting Company states that Romanian military sources claim that Romanian troops in the far south, departing from Galatz, have penetrated 50 miles into Russian-held Bessarabia. However, Russian resistance is extremely fierce, and casualties on both sides are heavy. The Russian army has now changed from defense to offense, launching counter-attacks on Romania and East Prussia. It is reported that the German air force is very active behind the Russian army's lines.

Havas, Rome, 22nd - The Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" reports that German and Romanian electrical companies have already estimated the Bukovina region (which has been ceded by Romania to the Soviet Union) and the city of Cernăuţi (also known as Chernivtsi). The Red Army seems to intend to completely abandon the Romanian territories occupied last year in order to lure the Iron Army deep into the country and then engage in battle with them.

International News Service, Berlin, 24th - A Soviet submarine base in the Black Sea was subjected to a fierce air raid yesterday. The base is believed to be Odessa. Although resistance was strong, the Soviet navy was heavily bombed by German aircraft.

### Hungary Declares Severance of Relations with Soviet Union - No Military Action Planned for Now

United Press, Budapest, 24th - It was officially announced yesterday that Hungary has severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

United Press, Budapest, 24th - Authoritative sources declared today that the Hungarian government's attitude towards the war has changed, and it is not considering military action. The severance of relations with the Soviet Union is merely an act of solidarity, similar to Slovakia's actions, and will have no immediate military effect.

Berlin Claims Breakthrough of Red Army Strongholds

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 24th - A Haitong News Agency reporter learned last night from military officials here that German infantry broke through several strongholds in the Red Army's defense line yesterday. A German infantry company, after two hours of fierce fighting, attacked five enemy obstacles and then occupied an important strategic stronghold on the Red Army's defense line.

United Press, Berlin, 24th - The German and Soviet armies, which constitute the world's largest land forces, began a decisive battle this morning on a 1,500-mile long front. "The German News Agency" stated that the German High Command anticipates an unprecedented large-scale war soon, as the German army has broken through several points in the Soviet army's defense line and will engage the main force of the Soviet army. However, the German High Command is keeping the development of the war strictly secret. To date, it is unknown where the German army broke through the Soviet army's lines or where the main forces of the German and Soviet armies will clash. German radio reported last night that a large number of Soviet troops intended for offensive operations are concentrated near the border, which is sufficient to indicate that the Soviet Union may now be feeling the pressure of the German infantry's attack. German aircraft attacked Soviet army traffic today, causing extensive damage. Railways, highways, stations, bridges, and moving convoys were all bombed. German aircraft also bombed a point behind the Soviet lines, destroying twelve tanks and armored vehicles moving towards the border, and destroyed two bridges in another location.

Germany Attempts to Cross the Black Sea to Seize Soviet Oil Fields

United Press, Ankara, 24th - Well-informed military sources believe today that one of the most important routes of the German offensive may be across the Black Sea to Batumi. The purpose of this move is to immediately cut off the Soviet Union's oil supply. The German army will likely use barges accumulated at the mouth of the Danube River, as well as all ships owned by Germany, Italy, and Romania, and possibly ships from Bulgaria and Greece. According to sources here, the largest concentration of German troops is in Slovakia and southern Poland. The German army hopes to launch an offensive north from there into Ukraine, then directly to the Caucasus. Once the German army occupies the area, the fighting is not expected to last more than six weeks, which will trigger a revolution and establish puppet governments in White Russia and Ukraine. The leader of these governments may be Prince Ferdinand, who served as the leader of the Ukrainian government under German administration during the last World War.

Soviet Factories Move Inland in Preparation for Scorched Earth Warfare

Reuters, Tokyo, 24th - Observers here say that the German plan for the Soviet Union is to implement a swift war, occupy Ukraine and the Caucasus in a short period of time, establish a puppet Russian king, and instigate revolution in other parts of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the German army will advance towards the Persian Gulf. Hitler's offensive in the east is intended to bomb major Soviet industrial cities such as Kharkov, Odessa, Dnipropetrovsk, and Leningrad. The German strategy hopes to thereby render the Soviet Union unable to fight. Although Soviet citizens have been receiving air defense training for several years, it is believed that there are not many air raid shelters in Soviet cities. For example, reports of air raid shelters in the Kremlin have only recently emerged. Therefore, it is expected that the Nazis may use bombing to intimidate civilians. Another city that may be heavily bombed by the Germans is Veshenskaya on the Don River, which is a key point on the Caucasus Railway and also one of the oil pipeline distribution points. However, Stalin has long been aware of the excessive industrial danger in the southwest and northwest, so he has moved some heavy industry to the Urals. Therefore, Magnitogorsk and other places are now important in the Soviet Union. Aircraft factories have also been moved to areas that are not easily attacked. In fact, outside of the Moscow area, the largest aircraft factories are now located in the east. The German offensive seems to have several routes: (1) Attacking Ukraine and Crimea from Black Sea bases, with a combined land, sea, and air assault, or even dropping paratroopers at key points such as Rostov, while also using shallow-draft boats to transport troops to attempt landings in Crimea and Batumi; (2) A large number of German troops are concentrated in the Czech Republic and are expected to launch an offensive from there. The Soviets must prepare for pressure from the Baltic Sea and from Finland. Regarding the southern front, the Soviets have built a large number of airfields in Ukraine and Bessarabia. Along the Black Sea coast, the Soviets have erected powerful coastal batteries since 1939. These coastal guns can be moved if necessary. In addition, the Soviets have coastal patrol boats, submarines, and other warships in the Black Sea. It is reported that the effectiveness of these submarines is quite high. There are also large Soviet troops in Ukraine, and the Pripet Marshes there are also helpful to the Soviets. The Soviets have built a line of fortresses in the Karelian Isthmus and used the batteries of the Mannerheim Line for defense.

### The Entire Soviet Union United Against the Enemy - Moscow Calm and Collected - Brave Men Abandon Wives and Children to Rush to the Battlefield - People in the Rear Each Fulfills Their Patriotic Duty

Reuters, Moscow, 24th - Soviet radio broadcasted last night in Russian, with no war reports, only patriotic speeches and news of workers' meetings. The station also stated that when Moscow received news of the German attack, the people were quite calm. The situation on the streets, in factories, and at train stations was normal. Movie theaters and theaters were still full of audiences. Thousands of men and women have joined the air defense forces. A blackout was implemented in Moscow last night. "Pravda" commented that the Soviet Union is fully equipped spiritually and materially to defeat and destroy the enemy. In 1918, we had just begun to create the Red Army and its strength was weak, but today a strong Soviet Union stands tall, holding the firm belief that our people will be victorious. The Soviet Union will understand that this war is an unjust war.

Reuters, Moscow, 24th - The Soviet General Staff's first war report stated that the enemy has only penetrated a maximum of five miles. Encouraged by this, the residents of Moscow were in high spirits at work yesterday. The mobilization order issued on Sunday night was effective yesterday. Train stations were crowded with parents seeing off their children and women seeing off their husbands to join the army. The men joining the army were mostly tank drivers, machine gunners, and aircraft pilots. Their parents were mostly farmers working in the fields of Moscow. There were many touching scenes at the train station, as Russians are easily moved by emotion. However, the people's trust in the strength of the Red Army and the Air Force is beyond doubt. Churchill's broadcast message spread quickly, allowing the Soviet people to not be under the impression that this was a continued attack on communist countries.

TASS, Moscow, 23rd - Stalin and Molotov continue to receive letters of enlistment from the people. In the letters and telegrams, the people unanimously requested to join the Red Army and go to the front line to fight the German fascist bandits to the death. At the same time, families are requesting the government to mobilize them to serve in the army. In Magnitogorsk, a father and son named Glieriev requested to join the volunteer army to fight against the invaders. Also, the Zhuplov brothers and their wives both requested to join the Red Army. Many women have requested to join the service this time.

Editorial

### An Epoch-Making War

Germany's sudden attack on the Soviet Union was not only beyond the general expectations of the world, but also violated ordinary reason and common sense. Relying on the essence of its so-called "blitzkrieg," the Nazis often took advantage of moments of inattention and slackness to suddenly strike the enemy, concentrating their strength and betting everything on a single throw. Therefore, the key to their gambling victory lies in only one or two of the most fatal points. This German-Soviet war is of course no exception. Hitler's illusory hope of winning probably rests on the following two points: first, the temporary observation of the situation by Britain and the United States, so that he can break through Britain and the Soviet Union one by one; second, the rapid defeat of the Soviet military. Regarding the former, British Prime Minister Churchill's speech the day before yesterday, and the reaction of Britain and the United States in the past two days, have shattered his delusions; regarding the latter, regardless of the quality of the battle, the numerical superiority of the Soviet army in terms of manpower and materials is an objective fact, and the vastness of Soviet territory is a fatal blow to any aggressor. According to yesterday's telegrams, it seems that the German side hopes that a domestic revolution will break out in the Soviet Union to help its own victory. This is even more absurd and unrealistic fantasy. Historically, we have only seen external wars used to alleviate domestic revolutionary crises, and rarely has a revolution broken out before a final military defeat in a large-scale war. The brilliant achievements created by Germany's "blitzkrieg" in the past two years have actually increased its own illusion of invincibility, but this misstep and adventure has undoubtedly pushed it into an unprecedentedly dangerous situation.

From the Soviet perspective, it has indeed reached a point where it cannot accept Germany's demands, agree to Germany's request for passage, and further "economic cooperation." If Germany and Italy were to rush to the Middle East and India in one fell swoop, they would inevitably propose a crusade to attack the Soviet Union. At that time, after completely losing its land-based base for fighting Italy, even if Britain and the United States did not accept the deception of Germany and Italy, in fact, they would at most have to remain neutral. Then, the danger of the Soviet Union's position under the combined attack of eastern and western violence is of course not difficult to imagine. Therefore, the Soviet Union's resolute action this time is indeed a very wise decision.

As for Britain, the stability of its position in the Middle East and Africa since the Balkan campaign is largely due to the firm opposition of Turkey and the Soviet Union to "passage" and compromise with Germany. This is a major issue related to Britain's most vital interests. During the process of Hess's flight to England and the atmosphere of German-Italian compromise reaching its peak, Britain still firmly refused any proposals to negotiate with Germany, ultimately enabling the Soviet Union to persist to the end and forming today's situation. Therefore, from Britain's perspective, now that the situation has absolutely improved, it will never stand idly by for its own sake, allowing Hitler to achieve his most ideal goal, namely, after slightly defeating the Soviet army, turning around and sweeping to India in one fell swoop. Therefore, the expression of active aid to the Soviet Union by Britain and the United States is a natural conclusion of reason.

What we must pay the most attention to is the epoch-making significance that this German-Soviet war has given to the entire international situation. After the last European war, the greatest ideal of Wilson and others in advocating the League of Nations was to abolish war forever. In order to achieve this goal, they believed that they had to start by abolishing the secret diplomacy of scheming and manipulation. However, the ideal is exactly the opposite of the reality. Before the outbreak of this European war, the reason why the forces of violence advanced step by step, and the reason why international justice and fairness gradually declined, was precisely the increasingly active resurgence of secret diplomacy: and "power politics" became the highest guiding principle in diplomacy. There is no so-called international principle or common stand outside of this. In this German-Soviet war, if viewed from a purely selfish and short-sighted perspective, the Soviet Union may have a fantasy of trying to let Germany pass through Turkey, forcing the United States to get involved in the war, and reaping the benefits; Britain may attempt to temporarily secure peace, letting Germany and the Soviet Union fight, and then make plans for the future; the United States may be happy to see the Soviet Union join the war, thereby relaxing its determination to aid Britain. If that were the case, then Hitler's "blitzkrieg" would of course succeed. Therefore, we can say that the wise actions of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union this time are due to their foresight, but the most important thing is that they can abandon the petty jealousies and calculations of their own small interests, adhere to the common stand of defeating violent ideologies, unite on this basis, and fight together. This is a rare event in recent international affairs! In recent years, what those who love international justice have always hoped for is precisely this great situation, and now it has finally appeared. Developing along this path, closer cooperation or formal alliances between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are of course a given; and in order to further strengthen the world's justice forces and consolidate their alliance, they will inevitably concentrate all the world's justice forces. They will consider the establishment of the entire post-war international order on a larger scale and explore a program of the most basic common war objectives. What Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have revealed and expressed so far is only the first step, but the dawn of this great movement has already shone on the entire earth.

Chongqing - According to reports from the Yichang front line, last night the Chinese artillery unit bombarded the Yichang Japanese airfield, destroying 13 Japanese aircraft. The Japanese army had recently transferred a large number of fighter planes and bombers to the Yichang airfield for bombing Sichuan Province. Yesterday afternoon, after the Japanese aircraft attacked various counties in Sichuan Province, they flew back to Yichang shortly after 6:00 PM and landed at the airfield. The Chinese artillery unit in the mountains on the south bank of the Yangtze River suddenly opened fire, fiercely bombarding the airfield. At that time, there were 19 Japanese aircraft parked in the airfield, and 13 of them, including several bombers, were hit by shells and caught fire. The remaining six aircraft suddenly took off and escaped from the thick smoke. Then, the Japanese artillery unit also returned fire, and the two sides fiercely bombarded each other for a long time before stopping.

### Welles Harshly Condemns Germany's Unprovoked Invasion of the Soviet Union; The United States Recognizes Germany as the Main Danger to the Americas; Will Seek Ways to Provide Assistance to the Soviet Union

Reuters, Washington, 24th: Undersecretary of State Welles formally declared the United States policy yesterday at a press conference, condemning Germany's unprovoked attack on Russia, saying that the current problem for the American people is Hitler's plan to conquer the world, which should be contained and broken. The United States has not yet received any documents from Russia, so the government has not yet made any decisions regarding the issue of providing assistance to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act. However, he feels that this case allows President Roosevelt to provide assistance to any country resisting aggression. The United States can now know without a doubt the intentions of the current German government in negotiating non-aggression pacts. Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky has discussed with the U.S. government the unfreezing of Soviet funds in the United States, but no decision has been made. Hitler's army is the main danger to the United States today. According to the U.S. government, any collection of forces to resist Hitlerism, no matter where this force comes from, can contribute to the overthrow of the current German leaders and benefit the national defense and security of the United States. If further proof is needed of the current German leaders' true intent to conquer the world, this evidence can be obtained from Germany's treacherous attack on the Soviet Union. Solemn oaths not to attack each other are, in the view of the current German leaders, merely a symbol of deception. The current German government has never known the meaning of the word "honor." Welles also stated that neither the Nazi nor the Soviet government allows its people religious freedom. In the view of the American people, the various principles and doctrines of communist dictatorship cannot be tolerated by the American people and are contrary to the beliefs of the American people, just like the principles and doctrines of Nazi dictatorship. Neither of these two dictatorships can obtain any support in the American people's way of life or administrative system. However, the problem that the American people are currently facing and must be solved immediately is to effectively contain and defeat the plan to conquer the world in order to enslave the people of all countries and destroy the free and democratic system, as Hitler is now desperately trying to implement. This is a problem faced by realistic Americans, and it is also a problem that has the most direct relationship with our national defense and the security of the Western Hemisphere at this time.

Reuters, Washington, 24th: Everyone who heard the remarks made by Assistant Secretary of State Welles condemning Germany's attack on the Soviet Union knows that the policies of Britain and the United States are now proceeding along parallel lines in this new stage of the world war. Washington officials rarely use such profound words to criticize foreign countries as Welles did. Welles made these remarks after meeting with President Roosevelt, so his remarks naturally obtained the president's consent and were no different from being spoken by the president himself. The remarks of Welles and Churchill have clearly indicated that Hitler has failed to cause any differences of opinion on the part of the British or American governments. Up to now, American newspaper commentary has mostly praised Churchill's position, and there has been very little mention of the policy that the United States should adopt towards the Soviet Union. If newspapers are waiting for guidance from officialdom, then Welles has now announced and guided American policy. It is expected that this announcement can arouse a great deal of support for the government's position and eliminate the division of public opinion on the path that the United States should follow. Those who previously opposed President Roosevelt are now indeed gradually supporting him, and left-leaning organizations and leaders who previously felt that American aid to Britain was useless will now adopt a clearly different tone.

### Halifax Visits Roosevelt

Reuters, Washington, 24th: British Ambassador to the United States Halifax went to the White House yesterday to meet with President Roosevelt. This conversation is part of the meetings currently being held by the President, the State Department, and British officials to analyze how the recent developments in the war situation will affect the United States. There is still no indication of whether the President has made any decisions. After President Roosevelt had a telephone conversation with Secretary of State Hull, who is temporarily not working due to a slight illness, he had two more telephone calls with Welles. Welles then went to the White House in person.

### Britain Sends a Military Delegation to the Soviet Union; Has Obtained Soviet Agreement; The Two Countries Help Each Other and Jointly Deal with Germany; British Ambassador to the Soviet Union is About to Return to His Post

Associated Press, London, 24th: An official confirmed today that the Soviet government has accepted Britain's proposal to send a military and economic delegation to the Soviet Union to coordinate the common task of defeating Germany. Officials emphasized that Britain's assistance to the Soviet Union will be on a reciprocal basis. Before the official confirmation, reliable sources declared that Moscow had accepted British assistance and was willing to provide military and economic assistance to Britain in return.

Reuters, London, 24th: According to reliable sources this morning, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Stafford Cripps will return to Moscow to take up his post.

Associated Press, London, 24th: Reliable sources here said yesterday that Moscow had accepted Britain's offer of assistance and would provide Britain with military and economic assistance from the Soviet side. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky visited the Foreign Office to discuss the status of the Soviet Union with British Foreign Secretary Eden. It is reported that Maisky submitted Moscow's reply to Britain's offer of assistance, which was in response to Eden's inquiry to the Soviet Ambassador on Sunday about the Soviet Union's true needs.

Reuters, London, 24th: New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser announced in London last night that after discussing with the New Zealand government, he can now state that New Zealand fully agrees with the policy regarding the German attack on the Soviet Union described in the American Prime Minister's broadcast on Sunday night and is happy to act in concert with the British government on this matter. New Zealand is the first British dominion to formally endorse the British policy of aid to the Soviet Union.

### British Troops in Syria Occupy Palmyra; The British Army Launches Another Fierce Attack on Merjayoun; French Warships in the Port of Beirut Sunk by the British

Associated Press, Cairo, 24th: Yesterday afternoon, reliable non-official sources here reported that British troops had occupied Palmyra, an important desert field for controlling eastern Syria.

Reuters, London, 24th: According to a communiqué published today, British troops have reached the ancient city of Palmyra (150 miles northeast of Damascus) in the Syrian desert steppe and are encountering resistance from Vichy forces. Allied forces are also in contact with Vichy forces west of Damascus, but the situation there is quiet. The Vichy communiqué stated that French forces and air forces in the Lebanon region and the Syrian desert are closely cooperating and are currently firmly resisting British forces. On Monday morning, British forces launched another fierce attack on Merjayoun, and fighting is ongoing. Vichy forces in the Damascus region are in contact with enemy forces and are strengthening their new positions, blocking the attack routes of Indian and New Zealand troops occupying Damascus. The British mechanized column entering Syria from Iraq continues to be attacked by the French air force.

### German Giant Cruise Ship "Bremen" Burned Down; Result of Communist Sabotage

### Japan's Policy Towards Germany and the Soviet Union Difficult to Decide for the Time Being; Japanese Spokesman Refuses to Comment; Article 5 of the Tripartite Pact; Interruption of the Route to Europe Requires the Adoption of a New Trade Policy

Reuters, Tokyo, 24th: The cabinet was originally scheduled to issue a statement this morning clarifying Japan's position on the Soviet-German war, but this has now been postponed indefinitely. According to sources close to the government, Japan's continued silence is not a sign that Japan has no firm policy, but in fact, the authorities have long had a plan, but do not want to announce it in haste. At a time when it is most appropriate for Japan to adopt a policy that makes the major powers uncertain. When the spokesman of the Information Bureau, Ishii, met with foreign reporters this morning, the number of questions asked by the reporters was indeed rare in recent weeks. The reporters asked him to announce Japan's attitude towards the Soviet-German war. Ishii replied, "I am not in a position to speak at this time. Japan's policy will be announced by the government in the near future." When asked if there would be surprising news, Ishii said, "Please wait and see." Ishii refused to criticize Article 5 of the Tripartite Pact (i.e., Japan, Germany, and Italy confirmed that the above articles would not affect the political position of any of the three contracting countries towards the Soviet Union), saying that the article had already explained itself. He said at the end that Japan would faithfully abide by its treaty obligations to both belligerent countries. The fishery talks in Moscow are still in progress. Although there is war now, it is expected that the trade between Japan and the Soviet Union will still be carried out. As for the transportation via Siberia, "we have already stopped." He did not receive the news that the route has stopped selling passenger tickets, and it is only a precautionary plan.

Reuters, Tokyo, 24th: All newspapers here today carried short articles stating that since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, Japan's only trade route with Europe has been blocked, so Japan urgently needs to adopt a more vigorous foreign trade policy. The Nichinichi Shimbun said that the impact of the Soviet-German war on our country is multifaceted and complex. The government should urgently re-examine its foreign policy, and it is permissible for Japan to no longer be able to trade with Europe. We cannot expect the United States and other markets to improve. Although trade with the Near East via the Mediterranean Sea, as well as the Indian Ocean and the South Seas, is not expected to deteriorate further at present, it is also a cause for concern. It is now urgent to implement the Commercial Control Law to expand wartime trade, so as to establish self-sufficiency within the yen bloc and build a new order in East Asia. The Yomiuri Shimbun said that since it is no longer possible to transport goods from the Siberian Railway, Japan's trade with Europe has been completely blocked. Not only that, but the United States' determination to participate in the war is growing stronger, so it has strengthened commercial controls and is trying its best to obstruct trade between the Axis powers and the countries of Central and South America. Japan must now abandon its free trade policy and effectively implement controlled foreign trade.

### British Aircraft Bomb Northern France

Reuters, London, 24th: Within hours of British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast promising to bomb Germany day and night, the Royal Air Force took swift action to fulfill the Prime Minister's promise. Yesterday, British bombers, escorted by a large number of fighter planes, flew over northern France at least twice to bomb an important factory and other targets near Beussent. The escorting fighter planes shot down 19 German fighter planes. The targets of the second attack in the evening have not yet been disclosed. However, British residents on the coast, who are accustomed to hearing the sound of explosions, have learned from experience that the aircraft were launching a fierce attack on German advanced airfields last night. Three British bombers did not return, and twelve German fighter planes were shot down. There was fog over the English Channel at the time, and the people on the coast of Kent could not see the situation on the other side of the Channel, only hearing fierce explosions from the French coast, and it could not be determined where they came from. On Sunday night, the cities of Bremen and Wilhelmshaven in northwestern Germany were heavily bombed. In the past three days, the German air force has lost 75 fighter planes in the skies over northern France and the English Channel. In the past eight days of continuous combat, German aircraft have lost a total of 117 planes, while British aircraft have lost 30 planes, a ratio of four to one.

### Japanese Representative Sawada Makes a Statement

Reuters, Batavia, 24th: Japanese Chief Representative Sawada told a reporter from the Guaba Port Newspaper today that the Netherlands now has no reason to worry that the products of the Dutch East Indies may be handed over to Germany via Japan. However, there is no chance to continue the negotiations, because both sides are quite satisfied with the understanding they have reached and will maintain the policies announced in the final joint declaration. Sawada regarded the new developments in the war as a new turning point in the European war. If Germany wins, it will be able to continue the war in a more satisfactory state. If the Soviet Union wins, the European war may come to an end.

Reuters, Tokyo, 24th: Ishii, a spokesman for the Information Bureau, said this morning when meeting with foreign reporters that the Dutch East Indies authorities had previously refused to supply Japan with rubber and tin, using the excuse that Japan would transport these items to Germany via Siberia. Now that the Soviet Union and Germany are at war, they will have no excuse to use. Therefore, Japan's position on this issue has been greatly enhanced. He said that after Sawada returns to his country, the negotiations will continue with the Dutch side by the Japanese Consul General in Batavia.

### Finland Adopts a Defensive Stance; Declares Neutrality; Still Fulfills Treaty Obligations to the Soviet Union; British Relations with Finland Remain Unchanged

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 24th: As of this month, Finnish troops and German troops within Finland have not commenced any military operations. Finland not only remains neutral in law, but in fact, its treaty obligations to the Soviet Union are also strictly fulfilled. For example, yesterday, Soviet military trains were still allowed to travel from the country's border to the Soviet military base on the Hanko Peninsula in Finland, in accordance with the treaty provisions.

Havas News Agency, Switzerland, 23rd: The Finnish Embassy in Stockholm recently issued a statement saying that Finland is taking a purely defensive attitude in this German-Soviet war. Diplomatic relations between Finland and the Soviet Union have not been severed, and there is even less talk of a declaration of war. Even if Soviet aircraft carry out bombings of Finnish cities, Finland has not taken any retaliatory action. However, if Finnish territory is attacked, it will naturally come out to defend itself.

Havas News Agency, Switzerland, 22nd: The Basel Evening News recently published a special dispatch from the Finnish capital stating that although German leader Hitler had announced a declaration of war against the Soviet Union in conjunction with Finland and Romania, according to official sources here, Finland has not yet formally declared war on the Soviet Union. Soviet Ambassador Volnov is still stationed in the Finnish capital, and he has announced that there is no reason for him to leave, which is clear evidence. The armies commanded by Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim are currently stationed on the border. Although German troops have advanced towards the Soviet Union north of Lake Ladoga, Finnish troops have not participated. Soviet aircraft flew in to bomb yesterday, showing that the country has decided not to allow German troops to use Finland as a base for attack.

Associated Press, London, 24th: An authoritative source here said yesterday that Britain's relationship with Finland remains unchanged because Finland is not allied with Germany.

Reuters, Stockholm, 24th: The Swedish newspaper Finnish Capital Telegraph stated that the situation in Finland is calm. Another telegram stated that the evacuation of women and children in the Finnish capital is proceeding smoothly, and the Finnish capital has not yet issued a lighting control order. The Finnish Capital Radio Station stated that the Finnish military headquarters has ordered all cities and densely populated areas to take air defense protection measures. More than a thousand Finnish children have arrived in Sweden. Last night, an air raid alarm was issued in southern Finland. A Finnish fishing boat sailed out of Petsamo Bay and was bombarded by Soviet short-range artillery. The Finnish President issued an order to severely punish those who disseminate military information. The Finnish side has imposed strict checks on telephone calls to Sweden.

### Soviet Aircraft Attack Finland; Finland Lodges a Protest

Haitong News Agency, Finnish Capital, 24th: Finnish Foreign Minister Professor Wuiding lodged an oral protest with the Soviet Minister on Sunday night, protesting against the Soviet Air Force bombing Finnish cities.

### United States Cancels Loan to Finland

Havas News Agency, Washington, 23rd: President Byason of the U.S. Export-Import Bank recently stated that the U.S. had proposed to lend 35 million U.S. dollars to Finland, but this has now been cancelled.

### Turkish Statement: Strictly Maintaining Neutrality, Unwavering in Commitment to Treaty with Britain

Havas News Agency, June 23rd, Istanbul Dispatch: Well-informed sources here revealed that the Turkish government's declaration of neutrality regarding the German-Soviet war is merely a strict adherence to international obligations and should not be seen as unusual. Regarding the Dardanelles Strait, continued precautionary measures will be taken. It seems neither Germany nor the Soviet Union intends to utilize Turkish straits. Furthermore, the German ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, visited Foreign Minister Saracoğlu today, personally presenting a copy of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's declaration of war against the Soviet Union. Additionally, British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, returned last night after spending the weekend in the countryside and was also received by Foreign Minister Saracoğlu today for discussions.

Havas World News Agency, June 24th, London Dispatch: It has been learned that the Turkish government has notified Britain that the Anglo-Turkish mutual assistance treaty not only remains in effect but also holds the highest priority in Turkey's international obligations.

### Spain: Anti-Soviet Stance, May Dispatch Volunteers to Aid Axis Powers in Combat

Reuters, June 24th, Madrid Dispatch: The Spanish cabinet began discussing the situation arising from the Soviet-German conflict yesterday and continued today.

Reuters, June 24th, Madrid Dispatch: The Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday afternoon first issued a statement to the press regarding the official evaluation of the Soviet-German war, stating, "I can assure you that the Spanish government, as the final interpreter of public sentiment, is pleased to hear that Germany is at war with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is a common enemy of all nations, and Spain's war of liberation was one of the most resolute and heroic struggles against this common enemy." Regarding rumors of dispatching Spanish volunteers to fight against the Soviet Union, the spokesman said, "While I have no authority, I can say that this is undoubtedly the wish of thousands of Spaniards." German Ambassador to Spain, Eberhard von Stohrer, informed Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano Súñer of Germany's actions against the Soviet Union and had a lengthy discussion with Franco. Subsequently, Súñer received the Italian and Japanese ambassadors, and today he will meet with the Turkish envoy.

### Lithuania: Declares Independence, Kaunas Under German Control

United Press, June 24th, Berlin Dispatch: Lithuanian sources reported that Kaunas Radio announced this afternoon that Lithuania has declared itself a free and independent nation and will support Germany's principles of a new European order.

United Press, June 24th, Berlin Dispatch: The German News Agency reported that German forces penetrated deep into Lithuanian territory just four hours after the start of hostilities.

Baltic Republics Support Soviet Union in War

TASS, June 23rd, Tallinn Dispatch: The Estonian people have expressed unanimous indignation at the attack on Soviet territory by German fascist bandits. They are determined to unite with other Soviet nationalities to eliminate this arrogant enemy. At a meeting of workers at the Tallinn power plant, worker Mansdi said, "The Estonian people have long suffered under German oppression. Our country was once occupied by Germany, but this kind of fact will never be repeated. For our country, for Stalin, we are determined to eliminate the enemy!" At the same time, personnel on several ships in Estonia and Latvia have passed resolutions expressing their determination to serve their country.

A dispatch from the Lithuanian capital also reported that the German bombing of the Lithuanian capital has aroused the indignation of the local people. The government has received countless petitions, with the people unanimously expressing their willingness to take up arms to defend their country. Thousands of women have requested to be sent to the front lines to care for the wounded.

### US Believes Japan's Policy is Purely Opportunistic; Although Temporarily Placed in a Difficult Position by the Axis Powers, If the Soviets Suffer Setbacks, Japan May Again Consider Advancing North

Reuters, June 24th, Washington Dispatch: The United States' greatest attention is, of course, focused on the Russian situation as it develops in the European theater. However, Japan's position in the situation created by this unexpected development is also particularly noteworthy. Japan has repeatedly been placed in a dilemma by its Axis allies. The Anti-Comintern Pact had just been signed in Berlin when Germany shook hands with Red Russia, whom Japan considered its greatest enemy. This caused Japan to hesitate at a crossroads for almost two years, eventually establishing a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union, sealed with a kiss, like a soldier kissing a love letter. Now, this treaty has just been concluded when Berlin suddenly shocked Tokyo with the news of an attack on Japan's newly established friend. Reports from Tokyo that Japanese authorities remained silent after hearing the news did not surprise people here. Japan has always valued "face" as a matter of national importance. Now, having been repeatedly embarrassed in public, how will it conclude this matter with the spirit of Bushido? This is what people here are speculating about. Japanese policy has changed repeatedly. If it changes again at the direction of Germany, observers of Far Eastern events will feel that Japan's focus is not on tying its political forces to any Axis power, but on tying itself to any force that can create conditions conducive to the realization of Japan's expansionist ambitions. In other words, according to Washington observers, Japan has no policy other than an opportunistic one. Its goal is hegemony in Asia. If Japan senses that the Soviet Union is about to be defeated by Germany and that a new opportunity has arisen to take Siberia or seize the Dutch East Indies, then Japan will at least begin its opportunistic policy. Japan may regret its recent treaty with the Soviet Union, but it may not have forgotten the moral support that Britain and the United States have given to the Soviet Union, and this support may even come in the form of material aid. In summary, people here will watch Japan's actions in the coming period with great interest. Japan's ambitions are well known. Japan has long openly coveted the Siberian coast in order to control Vladivostok, not only because planes can fly from there to Japan to bomb its important cities, but also because Japan can seize fishing rights without having to beg the Soviet Union. However, before advancing north, Japan should remember the futility of its attempt to conquer the Maritime Provinces of Siberia twenty years ago. Whether the situation in the Soviet Union will allow Japan to withdraw its large army stationed in Manchuria for use elsewhere remains to be seen. However, regardless of developments in European Russia, the Soviet Far Eastern Army may still engage Japan in a fierce battle in case of emergency. Reports from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun state that the Japanese government is now comprehensively considering various possibilities in order to cope with the new situation. There is certainly more than one aspect to these so-called possibilities. One can imagine that those who are impatient for action and those who advocate national development must be very busy.

United Press, June 24th, Washington Dispatch: Well-informed analysts of Far Eastern and diplomatic affairs announced today that the most significant impact of the Soviet Union's entry into the war is to shift the center of the "Pacific War" from the South Seas to the Sea of Japan. They said that from now on, movements in the Pacific will be centered on Japan and the Soviet Union, rather than on Japan and the Netherlands or Japan and the United States. They emphasized that this situation will continue until the Soviet Union's military fate is determined. The effect of this is of course to give the United States more time to prepare its outposts in the Far East, such as the Philippines, Guam, Wake Island, and the Samoan Islands, and it can also give the Dutch East Indies, Australia, Britain, and the United States a longer period to establish their cooperative scope in the South Pacific. Japan's current rational course of action is to focus on the situation in China and seek a solution, because the Soviet Union's participation in the war will inevitably reduce Soviet aid to China. However, the Chinese side is very pleased with the developments in the Soviet Union, as it has eliminated a major contradiction in China's foreign relations and united all forces sympathetic to China and opposed to Japan into a single group. Well-informed analysts stated that a Soviet victory may be a turning point in Far Eastern history, as it will isolate Japan and very likely force Japan to immediately reconsider its foreign policy. The Philippines is particularly concerned that the United States may relax restrictions on the shipment of coconut meat, coconut oil, jute, and other products to the Soviet Union, which the Soviet Union has been seeking to purchase in large quantities from the Philippines in recent months.

US Senator Believes Japan's Policy is Wrong

United Press, June 24th, Washington Dispatch: Senator Thomas, a Democratic foreign policy expert in the Senate who is widely regarded as a spokesman for the government, told United Press reporters yesterday that the main question raised by the Soviet-German war is how Japan will react. He said, "Today's Japan really needs the best political insights to make the smartest choice. I believe Japan should feel that it has associated with the wrong country and therefore feel confused." Senator Thomas added that he used to be a friend of Japan and lived in Japan for a long time. He also said, "I believe Japan has now discovered the mistake of associating with Germany, even though its Foreign Minister Matsuoka had received a warning from Hitler before going to Moscow." The senator added that he doubted whether Japan would still be close to the Axis powers today. "If Japan attacks the Soviet Union, then its supplies, due to the expansion of transportation, will become even more insufficient. If Japan takes this action, then the hope of advancing south will be suspended for a long time, and the Chinese guerrillas will also have an opportunity to become active." Thomas also said that what the United States needs most at present is national unity. He said, "The people of the country should allow President Roosevelt to be the spokesman for a united nation. Germans and anyone else should not be allowed to have the opportunity to alienate people's confidence in the government. In 1917, the Germans believed that President Wilson did not have the support of the people of the country. This must not be repeated today. We must allow the President to obtain the highest leadership during this dangerous period, so that everything the President does can receive unanimous national support." United Press also elicited opinions on the impact of the Soviet-German war from other senators. Senator Pepper, a Democrat from Florida who is also regarded as a government spokesman, said, "If the Soviet Union does not receive foreign aid, causing Germany to win, then the United States and other American republics will be surrounded. At that time, Hitler can attack the New World from both east and west. Siberia is only a few miles away from the American territory of Alaska. If Japan wages war against the Soviet Union, then our position will become more direct." Other senators believe that the United States and other American republics will indirectly benefit from the Soviet-German war, because the Americas will have ample time to consolidate the defense of the Western Hemisphere and step up aid to Britain. It was also said in this regard that it is very difficult for Germany to conquer the Soviet Union.

### Soviet Ambassador Meets with Matsuoka

Reuters, June 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: Soviet Ambassador Smetanin visited Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka at 3:30 PM today for a meeting lasting about half an hour, mainly to discuss the Soviet-German war. Italian Ambassador to Japan Indelli also visited Matsuoka at 2:30 PM for a 30-minute meeting.

### World Situation Outlook on the Soviet-German War: Japan's Situation Becomes Increasingly Difficult, Has Treaty Obligations to Both the Soviet Union and Germany, Does Not Know What to Do and Feels Anxious and Hesitant

Since Germany declared war on the Soviet Union, Japan, according to the Tripartite Pact, is obligated to aid Germany. However, Japan also concluded a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union this year. Therefore, according to this treaty, Japan must strictly maintain neutrality in the war between the two countries. Therefore, Japan is now in a difficult position, not knowing what to do and feeling very hesitant. Given that the two countries are evenly matched, the outcome is still uncertain. Moreover, since the Soviet Union was forced to join the war, it will likely form an alliance with Britain and the United States to fight together. Then, Britain and the United States will have ample military strength to station in the Far East to prevent Japan from launching aggressive actions in the Pacific. Japan should feel uneasy. Regarding Japan's difficult situation, the English-language China Evening News published an article yesterday commenting on it. The translation is as follows:

Japan's Situation is Extremely Difficult

The English-language China Evening News published an editorial yesterday entitled "What Does Matsuoka Think?" It stated that after Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Japan is in greater danger than any other country in the world, as it not only risks defeat in the war with China but also risks being reduced to a third-rate country. This is a fact, regardless of whether Japan knows it or not. If the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States press Japan at this time (which is quite possible), Japan will be cramped in a corner and barely able to breathe. If the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States keep pressing forward, then Japan will no longer be able to barely survive. Now, everyone believes that if Britain and France had resolutely urged Mussolini to clarify his position before suffering defeat, Italy would have been forced to either abandon its alliance with the Nazis or place itself in a war it could not win. Japan will now also find itself in this situation.

What to Do Must Be Decided

The Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States could jointly say to Japan, "You must quickly make the most definitive decision, abandon your dependence on the Axis powers, and come to our side to fight against Germany. Otherwise, we will consider you to be against us. If so, Soviet bombers will fly over the skies of Tokyo and Osaka, American warships will mass in Singapore, and your trade with all democratic countries will immediately cease. In short, in addition to China, you will face three major powers with well-equipped armies and firm determination, alone and without support. Decide quickly within twenty-four hours."

China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Unite

Of course, this question may not be posed so bluntly, but it is far better than not posing any kind of question at all and simply listening to Japan calmly observe and then take action. This is exactly what Japan wants. If we allow Japan to wait and see and then act, it would be a huge mistake. China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are in the same situation and can form a united front against Japan to influence Japan. This is the first time in many years. Whether the four countries will seize this good opportunity remains to be seen. However, one hundred million Japanese people will be covered in cold sweat after considering this.

Continental Daily News Comments that Germany is Fighting for Oil Fields

The Continental Daily News published yesterday continued to comment on the Soviet-German war, entitled "Fighting for Oil Fields." The translation is as follows: "Although the real reason for Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union cannot be known, there is no doubt that he has violated his promise to the people that Germany does not want to fight on two fronts."

Germany Lacks Food and Oil

Judging from Germany's current situation, it can be seen that Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union is nothing more than to obtain two kinds of resources: food and oil. Hitler may have solved the difficulty of food, as he has long done everything possible to plunder the food of the people of all of Europe. However, the supply of oil is still a problem. Modern warfare is motorized, and motors need oil. It can be seen that oil is important in war.

Existing Production is Greatly Insufficient

At the end of World War I, Lord Curzon declared that Germany's failure was not due to a lack of blood, but to a lack of oil. Friedrich Flick, a first-class German economic expert, also declared in 1937 that a modern army without oil is as dangerous as lacking food or weapons and cannot win. According to his estimation, Germany needs 15 million to 20 million tons of oil annually during wartime. According to the estimation of another economic expert, Paulssen, it is even greater. According to him, a belligerent country needs 25 million to 37 million tons of oil in the front and the same amount in the rear. However, Germany only produces 550,000 tons of natural oil. In 1937, Germany had eleven factories that refined oil from coal, and their production only accounted for 35.9% of the 5.15 million tons of oil needed. Now, adding the oil production of the countries it has occupied, including 100,000 tons from Austria, 19,000 tons from Czechoslovakia, and 6.35 million tons from Romania (Romania's production in 1936 was 8.70 million 0.35 thousand tons), it is still not enough for its consumption.

Difficult to Quickly Resolve Conflicts with Many Enemies

Therefore, from one perspective, it is believed that Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union indicates that his attack on the Anglo-Soviet front has failed due to a lack of oil. At the same time, a lack of food is also a major reason. Hitler now needs to occupy the Soviet Union's vast oil fields in order to obtain a large supply of oil. However, unfortunately for Hitler, he has added a new enemy. Therefore, Hitler must fight quickly."

### Soviet Nationals in This City Support the Government in War, Send Telegrams to Stalin and Participate in Battles, A Large Number of White Russians Register and Request to Enlist

Soviet nationals in this city expressed enthusiastic joy yesterday after reading the extra edition of the Russian-language newspaper, which published news of the Red Army's victory in the resistance war. Throughout the city, Soviet nationals purchased national flags and hung them on their roofs to show their respect for their country. The Soviet General Association also sent another telegram to Stalin yesterday, expressing their unwavering support. The original telegram read, "We, at the special meeting of the Soviet General Association, decided that due to the invasion of our beloved country by fascist bandits, we hereby sincerely declare to the Soviet Federal Republic that we are now ready and willing to immediately mobilize under the leadership of the government and the party."

Soviet Women Knit War Garments

Soviet women are also making their homes a part of the fight against the Nazi attack. Soviet women in this city have begun to knit shirts and prepare comfort items to send to the Red Army soldiers. At the same time, many White Russians in Shanghai have also expressed their willingness to help the Soviet Union resist Germany. A large number of White Russians have registered their names with the authorities so that they can go to the Soviet Union and participate in the war.

### Chinese Troops in Eastern Zhejiang Advance, Counterattack Ningbo and Shaoxing

In the Eastern Zhejiang war, the Chinese army has only had minor engagements in various places in the week since the recovery of Zhuji. It is now heard that the Third War Area, seeing that Eastern Zhejiang is located in a vital area, has mobilized elite troops to launch a major counterattack on Ningbo and Shaoxing. Fierce fighting has broken out again in the area around Yuyao, and the Chinese army has occupied several important strongholds and is advancing forward.

### Foreign Firms Continue to Supply Rice at Normal Prices, Hoarders Suffer Another Blow

Rice Shops Secretly Move Weights on Scales and Deduct Quantities

After the authorities definitively clarified the news that the suspension of sales of foreign rice was completely untrue the day before yesterday, the general domestic households in the market were greatly disappointed yesterday. Although they reduced the price of their hoarded goods to seek sales, no one asked about them. Those speculators who are accustomed to spreading rumors also felt at a loss, and the number of transactions decreased greatly. The price of rice at each stall fell by several yuan per picul.

Permits for Selling Rice at Shops Still Approved

According to news from the Liki Foreign Firm, requests from various rice shops to issue permits for selling rice at shops at affordable prices are still approved as usual, and there are no restrictions on the quantity requested. Therefore, the rice shops are all convinced that the sale of foreign rice by the Municipal Council will not be interrupted. Yesterday, the quantity of foreign rice requested by each rice shop from the firm was reduced to more than 8,000 bags. According to another estimate, the Municipal Council's foreign rice stored in the rice shops is about 50,000 bags, and the amount stored in the grain shops is more than 60,000 bags. There are also 50,000 bags that can arrive in this port by the end of this month. As for the first batch of 5,000 bags of Minling rice from the Municipal Council shipped to Shanghai, the Liki Foreign Firm sent samples to the parties concerned yesterday for inspection, and everyone was satisfied. The sale will begin as soon as the Hong Kong telegram arrives.

Retail Rules Were Revised Yesterday

The regulations on the application for retail rice shops selling affordable foreign rice by the Municipal Council have been slightly changed since yesterday. The rules that each retail rice shop should follow have also increased from six to nine: (1) This kind of foreign rice is retailed to the public at a price not exceeding the highest price set by the Municipal Council when selling the rice. The retailer must display the retail price of the rice in a conspicuous place in the store at all times. (2) This rice can only be sold to households for consumption and cannot be resold. (3) The retailer must not sell the Municipal Council's foreign rice to households outside the boundaries of the store. (4) The retailer must sell this rice during normal business hours and when the public needs it, and must be subject to the restrictions issued by the Municipal Council at any time. Before further notice, each retailer must not sell more than one month's supply of food to any person or any party in any one month. (5) The retailer must sell the rice in its original form and must not mix it with other kinds of rice. (6) The retailer should always have enough (as much as the Municipal Council can supply) foreign rice to meet the needs of customers. (7) The retailer must fill in the quantity of foreign rice sold by the Municipal Council every day in the sales form prepared by the Municipal Council and send it to the nearby police station. (8) When a retailer sells one or more bags of this foreign rice to any buyer, he should issue an invoice stating the price, quantity, and the name and address of the buyer, and should send a copy of each invoice and the form mentioned above to the nearby police station. (9) If any of the above regulations is violated, the retailer's business license will be revoked and he will be prosecuted according to law.

Another Rice Shop Deducts Quantities

Lu Deshen (age 41), the owner of Deshun Rice Shop at No. 40 Zhao Jiaqiao Road, Hart Road, a native of Jiading, used special fraudulent means to remove the spring from the weight on the scale and mixed it with two copper coins to reduce the quantity, calculating that each picul of rice was short by two and a half catties. The matter was discovered by Cao Zhigang, the Chinese Deputy Captain, Zhang Yuanjing, the Chinese Deputy Inspector, and Xia Yeshan, an agent from the Jing'an Temple Police Station. They went to investigate and confirmed that it was true, so they arrested the shop owner Lu Deshen and took him and the scale to the police station for detention. They were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him for fraud and presented the case, requesting strict punishment. After a clear hearing by Judge Shen, Lu Deshen, the owner of Deshun Rice Shop, was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for fraud and was not allowed to commute the sentence by paying a fine. The scale was confiscated.

### Shanghai's Postal Lines with Germany and Italy Have Been Changed Since Yesterday

After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Shanghai Post Office has taken appropriate measures for mail to Europe via Siberia. According to reporters from the Datong News Agency, (1) Mail to Germany, Italy, Romania, and Finland from Shanghai has been changed since today and is now sent by Pacific mail ships. (2) Mail to other Central European countries must wait for notification from the Soviet Post Office or be dealt with after the mail in transit is returned. (3) At present, mail from Shanghai to Europe via Siberia, except for Germany, Italy, Romania, and Finland, is still accepted as usual.

### Soviet Ship Kovda Hastily Leaves Shanghai, Received News of Soviet-German Conflict in Advance, Fully Loaded with Huge Amounts of Oil and Raw Materials

The Soviet ship Kovda, with a deadweight of 1,255 tons, arrived in Shanghai from Vladivostok on April 3 of this year and has been docked for nearly three months. It is now learned that the ship set sail and left Shanghai at 6:00 AM the day before yesterday (June 23), fully loaded with huge amounts of oil, tires, tea, and rubber raw materials. It is reported that before leaving port, the captain received a telegram from Moscow about the outbreak of war on the Soviet-German border and decided to leave Shanghai as soon as possible and return to Vladivostok. In addition, there are only three Soviet ships remaining in Shanghai, namely the Soviet, the Komiles, and the Gorky, all of which are cargo ships. The date of their departure from Shanghai has not yet been determined.

### The Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation Artery: Only Two Routes Available, Both Requiring Crossing Hangzhou Bay

The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route, currently unable to offer direct passage, has historically seen travelers transit via Zhoushan. Those traveling from Shanghai to Ningbo would take a steamer to Zhoushan, then a sailboat to Chuanshan Dashu or Xinqi Pier, passing through Zhenhai to reach Ningbo. Those coming to Shanghai would take the same route in reverse. Since the beginning of this month, however, the Japanese navy has suddenly blockaded the areas from Zhoushan to Chuanshan Daxie Xinqi Pier, preventing the sailing of sailboats. Those attempting to cross illicitly have repeatedly been shelled by Japanese warships. This route has now been cut off. Those transferring via Zhoushan no longer pass through Chuanshan Xinqi Pier, but instead take sailboats to Xiepu for transfer. Those coming to Shanghai from Ningbo Xiepu take a sailboat to Wusong, then a steamer to Shanghai, or they take a boat from Xiepu to Zhangjiasha, then take a car to Shanghai. Alternatively, one could take a small Shanghai-Shengzhou steamer to Minhang, then a car from Minhang to Zhangjiasha, then a sailboat to Sanbei Songpu Town in Zhenhai, and then transfer to Ningbo. Those coming to Shanghai from Ningbo can follow the reverse route. Currently, only these two routes are available for Shanghai-Ningbo transportation, and they barely manage to function. Due to the many detours, it takes four or five days to reach Shanghai or Ningbo.

### Yu Qiaqing Initiates the Organization of an Enterprise Company, Hoping to Utilize Idle Capital from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Develop Resources in the Northwest Interior

Mr. Yu Qiaqing previously went to Chongqing to meet with central authorities and inspect resources in the Northwest interior. Mr. Yu has already flown back to Hong Kong. According to him, "At the end of April, I went to Chongqing to meet Chairman Lin Sen and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang were both in good spirits and health, which is something we can all be happy about."

The morale of the people in the interior is extremely high.

"The spirit and will to fight of all sectors in the provisional capital are extremely strong. Generally, everyone is able to bury themselves in their work." Mr. Yu continued, "My stay in Chongqing was very short. I then went to the Northwest for on-the-ground inspections and surveys of resources, which lasted for half a month. The results of this trip were very satisfactory. The Northwest is one of our wartime interiors. The morale of the people I saw was extremely high. The conditions in various places also left a very good impression."

The richness of the Northwest has long been known.

"We have long heard of the richness of resources in the Northwest, but it is regrettable that they have not been developed due to various circumstances. The main resources in the Northwest are coal, iron, cotton, and wool. These are also the famous products of our Northwest and are urgently needed for our current war efforts." He also said, "When I returned to Chongqing from the Northwest this time, I originally planned to go to the southwest provinces, but wanting the people of the country to quickly initiate the organization and development of Northwest resources, I had to temporarily abandon my trip to the Southwest and return to Hong Kong first to report to all sectors. I will formally convene leaders of industry and commerce in Hong Kong within days to discuss the project. I hope to use the idle capital from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places, together with the industrialists and business people of Shaanxi, to jointly organize a large-scale enterprise company to actively develop the vast resources of the Northwest." It is also known that after Mr. Yu returned to Hong Kong, he has been discussing with relevant industrial and economic leaders in recent days. All parties have expressed extreme interest in the opinions put forward by Mr. Yu. Mr. Yu plans to go to the Southwest again in two months to continue his inspections.

### Chicago Daily News Reporter: Importance of the Yunnan-Burma Road; Considers Plans to Improve Transportation Capacity; Holds Optimistic Beliefs About China's Future

The Shanghai American University Alumni Association held its annual meeting yesterday afternoon at the American Club on Fuzhou Road. Chairman Yan Deqing presided over the meeting, presented the work report and accounts from the previous session, and elected the next session's officers. They also invited Mr. A.T. Steele, a Far East correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, to speak on "The Yunnan-Burma Road." Mr. Steele had just traveled from the southwest provinces via the Yunnan-Burma Road to Shanghai. He had also traveled in and out of Free China via this road before, so his impressions were very deep. Yesterday's speech eloquently expressed his observations and feelings. The main points are recorded below:

Important nature of the transportation artery

The importance of the Yunnan-Burma Road is well known to us. From Rangoon on the Burmese coast to Kunming, and then from Kunming connecting to Chongqing, the entire journey from Rangoon to Chongqing is two thousand miles. This is one of China's important international transportation lines during the war. Military supplies and raw materials are continuously transported inland, strengthening China's wartime material and economic power. It is believed that since the sudden outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the situation has changed dramatically, and the importance of this road will be even greater than before. We must attach extreme importance to it. From Rangoon, maritime transport reaches New York and other places, so calling it China's lifeline is hardly an exaggeration.

Bombing does not affect transportation

In April of this year, foreign raw materials and other necessities imported into China via the Yunnan-Burma Road reached 600,000 tons, including large quantities of gasoline. Mr. Steele saw 50,000 tons of goods piled up like mountains in Lashio a few weeks ago, waiting to be transported. Trucks on the Yunnan-Burma Road run continuously day and night, fulfilling their wartime transportation mission. Although Japanese bombing can damage the road, it is not enough to stop its active function. Often, after the bombing, a large number of workers are immediately ordered to repair it, repairing as quickly as it is destroyed. The flow of goods has not been severely affected. Even the bombing of the Mekong River Bridge cannot destroy the function of this road even slightly. The Yunnan-Burma Road, with its endless stream of traffic, thrives amidst bombing.

Burke increases transportation efficiency. The administrative organization of the Yunnan-Burma Road has been strengthening since Dr. Burke, former director of the China Relief Department of the American Red Cross, took office as Director-General of Transportation. Mr. Steele met with Mr. Burke before leaving Chongqing. According to Mr. Burke, there are five plans to improve the Yunnan-Burma Road: (1) The lack of vehicles reduces efficiency, so new vehicles should be purchased to increase the inland transportation of goods. (2) Private vehicles transport more goods through the road than public vehicles, which affects national wartime transportation and should be improved. (3) The road surface and roadside auxiliary equipment need to be improved. (4) Vehicles often return empty after unloading goods in Lashio or Kunming. Chinese tung oil, tungsten, tin, and other minerals should be transported outward by the original vehicles. (5) Personnel training, especially for drivers, is necessary to increase administrative efficiency.

Construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway begins.

Dr. Burke has always had experience in transportation, and shouldering such a heavy responsibility will surely bring great contributions. The plans he has set are also being gradually promoted and implemented. In order to strengthen the Yunnan-Burma connection and promote trade and transportation between the two places, the Yunnan-Burma Railway, which is being built from Lashio to the Chinese border, is 100 miles long. It is currently under construction. The section in Yunnan has now been completed for twelve miles and can be used for train travel. This railway runs parallel to the Yunnan-Burma Road, and its importance is self-evident. Once completed, the connection between China and foreign countries will become closer, and the inland transportation of goods and other necessities will surely increase rapidly. This road is being built jointly by the two countries, and the date of completion is not far away. Mr. Steele has traveled extensively in the southwestern provinces of China and has seen the development of transportation, the high morale of the people, and the progress of industry. He holds an optimistic belief in China's future.

### Retiring County Magistrate Commits Suicide Out of Pessimism

Dai Yuanming, 36 years old from Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, who once served as the magistrate of a certain county, and currently resides at No. 150 Jingan Villa, Jingan Temple Road, recently suffered a shock and was often unhappy. He suddenly swallowed a large amount of morphine in secret the day before yesterday.

### Shopkeeper of a Southern Goods Store Smeared with Feces; Perpetrator Apprehended on the Spot

Song Zhuozai, 40 years old, a native of Zhejiang and the owner of the Wang Wantai Southern Goods Store at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and North Hai Road, is an executive member of the trade association. Recently, due to a labor dispute, the labor side was dissatisfied with Song. At 1:00 PM on the 21st, Song was sitting in a chartered car passing the mouth of Caishen Lane, Yanghang Street, outside Xiaodongmen, when he was suddenly smeared with feces by the rascal Hu Asheng, a local.

### Bloodshed on Baoshan Road, Zhabei; Hu Changying Shot; Seriously Wounded by Two Bullets; Japanese Soldiers Search, Assailant Escapes

In recent years, assassinations and bloodshed have been frequent in the two concessions and the Hongkou and southwestern areas of Shanghai. However, no bloodshed had occurred in Zhabei. Unexpectedly, a shooting occurred on Baoshan Road, Xinmin Road yesterday morning, breaking the taboo of no bloodshed in the Zhabei area. The details of the bloodshed are recorded below:

Shot twice

Hu Changying, a native of Haining, Zhejiang, is 55 years old. He was a team leader and lived at No. 55 Lai'an Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. Yesterday morning at 8:15 AM, Hu finished breakfast and left home. Unexpectedly, when he reached the entrance of the lane, a man suddenly jumped out from the roadside and shot him. Hu was caught off guard and was shot in the chest and right shoulder, falling into a pool of blood.

Seriously wounded

After the Japanese and police received the news, they rushed to search the area. However, the man who fired the gun had achieved his purpose and disappeared. The Japanese then sent him to Fumin Hospital on Beisichuan Road for medical treatment. It is said that the injury is serious and his life may be in danger. The Japanese immediately conducted a strict search of pedestrians, residents, and vehicles in the area where the incident occurred and blockaded the bridges over the Suzhou River, increasing the number of marines stationed there. It was not until around 11:00 AM that the traffic was opened.

Strict search

According to foreign sources, after a Chinese man was shot and killed on Xingmin Road, the Japanese tightened security. The shooting occurred near the railway tracks of the North Station. The shooter was probably only one person. After the incident, the Japanese sent troops to the scene to set up a cordon and search every household, but it was not reported that the shooter was captured. The Japanese authorities said that the shooter was still hiding near the scene, so the search will continue. After the incident, the number of Japanese sentries on the three bridges over the Suzhou River and in Hongkou increased significantly. The Japanese sentries on the bridges checked bags, including bags carried by foreign women and even schoolbags of students. Japanese officials claimed yesterday morning that the Japanese had received reliable information that a large number of terrorists had secretly come to Shanghai, so these security measures were implemented.

### Letter

To whom it may concern: According to Mr. Zeng Heling, his mother, Zeng Liangshi, was unfortunately murdered and dismembered by thugs. The police have arrested four suspects, including Wang Zhaodi. The main culprit, Sun Wangshi, is still at large and is being pursued. However, I read a news item in the Shanghai News on the eighth page of the twenty-fourth of this month entitled "White Road" "Headless Female Corpse" which included the title "Formerly a Famous Prostitute in the Brothels." It was surprising to read. My mother was born into a famous family and always upheld the virtues of a married woman. My father was a businessman on the mainland and never set foot in brothels. The details reported in the newspaper do not match the facts and are an insult to the deceased. My mother was not only murdered for no reason but was also subjected to defamatory publication. The misfortune she suffered was extremely tragic. The lawyer should be asked to give a special request to your esteemed office to inform this misinformation to be amended. It is hoped that your esteemed newspaper will publish the letter, to correct the facts. Both the deceased and the living will be most grateful. Please send to the Shanghai News, lawyer Pan Zhensheng, June 14.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory issued the following weather forecast at 4:20 PM yesterday: The weather around Shandong is clear, with some cloudy areas, and gentle southeast to southwest winds. The coastal areas south of Ma'anshan Island are cloudy, hot, and foggy, with gentle southeast winds. A hurricane in the Pacific Ocean will move northwest. The center of the hurricane was at 2:00 PM at 12 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude, within 120 miles. The wind direction is northwest, and the wind force is unknown. Also, within 24 hours before 2:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in Shanghai was 85.3 degrees at the highest and 68.7 degrees at the lowest. On the same day last year, the highest was 83.5 degrees and the lowest was 75.2 degrees.

Commercial News

### Food: Southern Advance Unrealized; Rice Merchants Disappointed and Rice Prices Decline Again

Yesterday's morning rice market opened with Japan taking a neutral position on the current European war. The southern advance that rice merchants had been hoping for for months was still difficult to realize, which was very disappointing. The Public Works Department's rice continued to arrive daily, and they guaranteed that Hong Kong rice would continue to be shipped to Shanghai for sale without interruption. They also said that there were still 100,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice waiting to be sold. People's hearts were inevitably turning downwards, and the market was tired and lacking energy. Profitable bulls were even more eager to sell. Although foreign merchants refused to buy due to an increase of five yuan in shipping costs, Shantou, Ningbo, and the inland countryside also inquired about the price. However, the market remained soft, and both spot and futures rice fell by three to four yuan. Broken rice spot price was 119 yuan from Yinghua Company, while July Shang rice fell from 115 yuan to 113.5 yuan. Xiaojiao futures fell to 150 yuan, opening at six and closing at seven, with a high of 148 and 9 yuan, and a current price of 152 yuan. Second-grade Siam fell from 141 yuan to 140 yuan, with more than 1,000 tons traded. At closing, first-grade Saigon was sold at 128 yuan, second-grade at 123 yuan, decided at 121 yuan, first-grade Siam at 132 yuan, Xiaowen at 124 and 5 yuan, Mindang at 130 yuan, Jiafo rice at 128 yuan, Tokyo Zhongguan Jian rice at 114 yuan, 113.5 yuan, and broken Jian rice at 101 yuan to 99.5 yuan.

The Public Works Department's foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Jinan ship arrived in port yesterday afternoon, carrying 10,128 bags of Public Works Department's affordable foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the Wood Merchant's Wharf on the Bund of the French Concession (Zu).

Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica rice has become scarcer than before, the decline in foreign rice has dampened people's spirits. Sales in local stores have been sluggish, and sellers are reluctant to sell and have loosened their prices. Prices have fallen by two yuan. Early Nan rice opened at 137 yuan to 135.5 yuan, original package at 135 yuan, overnight decision at 131 yuan and 130 yuan. Wuxi original package overnight japonica rice was at 131 yuan to 118 yuan.

In this environment, glutinous rice is also difficult to stand firm, and all prices have fallen by about two yuan. Hong Kong Gaobai opened at 122 and 3 yuan, and was decided at 120 yuan. The opening price of the glutinous tea water and local glutinous rice was 126 and 7 yuan, and was decided at 124 and 5 yuan.

### Flour Market Suddenly Turns Downstream

45,200 bags of foreign flour arrive

Yesterday's spot foreign flour market turned sharply downstream. This was because the continuous rise in prices had been too fierce, all due to hoarding merchants manipulating the market. Actual sales had not been strong, and it was reported that 45,200 bags of foreign flour had newly arrived from Hong Kong at the Taikoo Wharf. In addition, amidst the changing international news, rice prices have declined, and people's spirits have softened. General floating groups have successively emerged, so the market rose sharply and retreated quickly. Jinlong brand Australian flour opened at 32 yuan and 4 jiao to 1 jiao, Cannon Brand flour at 33 yuan and 1 jiao to 33 yuan, and Huawu flour at 33 yuan and 3 jiao, each down three to five jiao from before. Nearly 20,000 bags were traded, and the market is still brewing.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Cakes Fall Sharply

Yesterday's miscellaneous grains and oil cakes market was as calm as usual. People's spirits were temporarily unaffected by strict influences, and the rice market has also leveled off. Therefore, all kinds of prices continued to decline, and the decline in bean cakes was even more severe. In short, actual sales were sluggish, and there was no interest at all. The overall situation was exhausted and could not be revived. Two vehicles of Yuanlong Feizi overnight colored cakes were priced at 16 yuan and 2 jiao. Qingzhong cake 300 pieces at 16 yuan and 9 jiao. Shengji cake May's lower warehouse order one thousand pieces, 17 yuan, and June's upper warehouse number June's lower delivery more than ten thousand pieces, priced at 17 yuan and 4 jiao to 17 yuan. June's lower warehouse order July's upper delivery more than two million pieces, the price dropped from 17 yuan and 8 jiao to 17 yuan and 3 jiao.

### Finance Exchange Rates Stable, Showing Slight Tightening

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw exchange rates mostly unchanged. The exchange rates listed by HSBC were unchanged. The informal exchange market for British and American currencies showed a slight tightening due to importers needing to settle payments for foreign rice, resulting in a stable but slightly tight situation. Foreign firms aggressively bought US dollars immediately after the morning opening, making it difficult to settle at 5.4375 yuan. The rate tightened to 5.40625 yuan. The British pound was at 3 shillings and 3225 pence. Soon after, Japanese banks continuously released US dollars, and speculators shorted, easing the tightening, so it rebounded slightly. The afternoon trend stabilized, with few transactions. Only forward-month US dollars remained unchanged, while near-term US dollars and British pounds slightly tightened, and trading became scarce.

Importers Settling US Dollars

Since the morning opening of the foreign exchange market, British, American, and Indian rates remained unchanged. The exchange rates of various countries against the US dollar rose by 25 against the British pound, and by 7 and a half points against Shanghai, and the rest were halved. The central government's listed exchange rates were all stable. At the opening of the domestic market, the bank selling prices were: spot British pounds at 3 shillings and 328125 pence, US dollars at 5.4375 yuan. Importing foreign firms aggressively bought June US dollars at 5.4375 yuan, which quickly softened to the point of being difficult to settle. The exchange rates listed by HSBC were unchanged. The silver equalization tax was still levied at 24.25%. The British pound also tightened to 3 shillings and 3125 pence, making it profitable to absorb spot goods at 5.4375 yuan, settling at 5.406625 yuan. Later, Japanese banks continuously sold, which stabilized the situation. Speculators shorted July at 5.4375 yuan, and at noon, it hardened back to the point of being difficult to sell and settle. At noon closing, US dollars for July were at 5.4375 yuan, near-term were at 5.40625 yuan, and British pounds were at 3 shillings and 3125 pence.

Afternoon Market Conditions Stabilize

No trading was heard in the afternoon, and market conditions stabilized significantly. It was rumored that speculators had shorted, but the price was unclear. At the 3:30 PM closing, spot to July British pounds were at 3 shillings and 325 pence, tightening by 0.015625. US dollars for spot and June were at 5.40625 yuan, tightening by 0.03125.

### Securities Type C, D, and E Shares See New Highs Again. The Rise of Type C is Too Pronounced. New Highs are a Strategic Retreat

The informal market for public bonds yesterday morning continued the previous day's rising momentum, with the bullish side continuing to aggressively push upwards. Type C shares again saw new highs, and Type D and E shares also broke through the highest record of January 22nd. However, some of the long positions were taking advantage of the opportunity to find a way to exit, and the market immediately saw a slight correction, equal to the market of the previous day. The long position line of defense gradually became unstable. At the opening of the afternoon session, the 3-yuan market was immediately broken, seeing a low price of 1.3 yuan. The small market was really because the price of Type C shares was too high, exceeding the reasonable price compared to other types. Therefore, under natural conditions, a slow adjustment was made. For example, the reasonable price ratio between Type A and Type C shares is that Type A is higher than Type C by 10 yuan. Today, the difference is only 7.8 yuan, which means that the price of Type A shares is 2.2 yuan at a disadvantage. The reasonable price ratio between Type C and Type E shares is that Type C is higher than Type E by as much as 1 yuan, but today it is actually higher by as much as 1.9 yuan, which means that Type E shares are at a disadvantage of more than 1 yuan. Even the price ratio between Type B and Type D shares is not on the right track, and there is still a tendency for adjustment in the future. Yesterday morning, Xie Xing Yuan's buying appetite was stronger, and Xinfu also had a buying appetite. Lianhe and Tongkang sold very strongly. Type C, D, and E shares hit new highs, and then immediately corrected slightly. In the afternoon, Xie Xing Yuan still had a buying appetite, and Xinhua Xinfu also continued to buy, while Tongkang Lianhe continued to exit. Dahua and Dazhong also couldn't hold on and sold more. Dingkang and Hengkang also exited immediately when the price rose, and cracks gradually appeared in the defensive line. Therefore, the opening price in the afternoon immediately broke the 3-yuan mark and saw a low price of 2.3 yuan. As a result, the price was slightly lower by 0.1 jiao to 0.45 jiao across the board. However, Type A shares plummeted by 0.7 jiao, which was uniquely high. The transaction volume was 1.67 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Stock transaction, 100 shares of China Merchants Cement Factory shares were traded at a price of 65 yuan.

The Public Utility Stock Exchange opened strongly and the trend became vigorous throughout the day, but high prices were not easy to maintain, and the closing price started to rebound slightly. Asian shares still accounted for the first place in transaction volume. The opening price was as high as 15.1 yuan, and then it gradually dropped to 14 yuan, and the closing price was 14.5 yuan. The transaction volume of rubber shares increased slightly, and the price fluctuated with the industrial shares.

Tan Shi Pang Foreign Company Manager's China International Trust Investment Co., Ltd. and Yangzi Silver Company have both set July 17th to pay an interim dividend for the year ending March 1942. International Trust will pay 1.25 yuan in national currency per share, and Yangzi shares will pay 7.5 jiao per share.

London, 23rd (Monday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British merchant companies' stocks were flat and sluggish, and the situation of the mushroom industry remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cloth Large Players Exit, Double Horse Rising Momentum Slightly Reduced, Hong Kong Traders Also Find Prices Expensive and Wait and See

The yarn market started to rise and then weakened. Real sales to Hong Kong traders saw reduced buying interest due to the price being too expensive compared to the previous day, but overseas cotton prices are rising step by step, and the psychology of a small number of people is still hoping for further increases. As for the short side, rumors of Soviet-Russian military disadvantages resurfaced, leading to selling. The market price first rose and then softened, but the warehouse receipts were still tight, totaling over 20,000 bales, so the time to collect warehouse receipts was delayed until 12 o'clock before it could be completed. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1559 yuan, and the low price was 1537 yuan. The initial trade in the afternoon was at 1544 yuan. It was said that the international situation was not good, and more sellers and floating longs closed positions, falling to 1532 yuan. The final price was 1534 yuan. Currently, the yarn market has the possibility of returning to the 1500 yuan level because large profit-taking players are selling. However, the cost of raw materials has already trended upward. Today, 3270 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened firm in the morning due to the bullish sentiment after the closing of the previous day. The opening price was 1555 yuan, immediately rising to 1559 yuan, fluctuating between 55 and 56 yuan for a long time. Subsequently, rumors of Soviet-Russian military disadvantages spread, and selling pressure suddenly increased, falling to 1537 yuan. However, a group of buyers, due to rising factory costs from rising US and Indian cotton prices, tended to buy, returning to close at 1542 yuan. A half-day trading statistic showed 10,000 bales were traded. Hong Kong traders bought 1000 bales, and domestic traders made 9000 bales of transactions.

The market for Jin Double Horse marked yarn was generally firm in the morning, but gradually declined as profitable players sold. The market continued to loosen in the afternoon. As a result, the July contract fell by 6 yuan, and the August contract fell by 7 yuan. 4490 bales were traded in the morning session, and 1770 bales were traded in the afternoon session, totaling 6260 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are recorded on the left:

Morning Session Afternoon Session

July Opening 1420.0 1410.0

July Closing 1412.5 1407.0

Daily High 1412.0 1407.0

August Opening 1426.0 1415.0

August Closing 1418.0 1415.0

Daily High 1426.0 1413.0

### Cotton is Deeply Hoarded, Yarn Factories are Actively Booking Brazilian Cotton

The current cotton situation is as firm as ever, because American cotton is rising steadily, causing those with spot goods to hoard them and not sell. The price of fine lint cotton can be imagined to be high. As for coarse lint cotton, there is also a significant increase in price, but the transaction volume feels flat and unremarkable. This is because those holding the goods are raising prices too high, and the factories are not in urgent need of raw materials, so they are temporarily watching and waiting. Each firm also has few large movements, and trading feels scarce. Only 650 pieces and 300 bales were traded in a single day, with prices rising by two or three yuan.

Middling 48.5 De Factory 50 pieces Delivered to the Factory

Peng Jia Po 242.5 Firm 100 pieces Machine Delivery

Also 241.5 Also 10 pieces Also

Also 344.0 Also 100 pieces Also

Lan Hua 215.0 Also 100 pieces Also

Also 116.5 Also 100 pieces Also

Also Special Grade 127.0 Also 100 pieces Also

Fire Grass Bale 197.5 Also 200 Bales Also

Also 199.0 Also 100 Bales Also

Another report: Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai is firm and prices are rising. Sentiment is bullish, and some industry colleagues are unwilling to purchase too much due to the high prices. However, because American and Indian cotton are repeatedly skyrocketing, and the German-Soviet war does not affect the Far East's position, yesterday, regardless of Chinese and foreign yarn factories, a large number of Brazilian cotton was still traded.

New York cotton market: First, the price was firm and rising due to speculative aggressive buying, and at the same time, it rose sharply due to Western firms' buying and strong Wall Street stocks. As a result, the closing price rose by 37 to 38 basis points compared to the previous day.

Indian cotton market: The price also rose due to the German-Soviet war's impact, speculative enthusiasm, and active short covering. Yesterday's closing price rose by 6 to 11 rupees.

It is also predicted that today's opening market will be 6 rupees higher.

### Piece Goods German Dyes Used to Dye Cloth, Hoarding and Refusal to Sell

Factory Cloth: The market fluctuated yesterday. The selling prices of each cloth varied, with both increases and decreases, mainly because real sales were still lacking, and the market psychology was shifting. Therefore, it became more erratic. White goods were few and far between. Thin cloth and twill cloth were loose and cheap, each piece falling by 2.5 to 5 jiao. Coarse cloth fell by 2.5 jiao. Bleached cloth and colored twill cloth were average. Unique Indian indigo and other high-quality colored cloths mostly used German dyes. Each factory and firm's inventory was hoarding and refusing to sell. Most did not quote prices for the time being. Some manual goods were priced higher by 1 to 2 yuan per piece, and prices were very chaotic. More than 100 pieces of each cloth were traded on this street. Ningbo traders from Eastern Zhejiang handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and coarse cloth, etc., and Guangdong traders handled more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill cloth, etc. On the 25th, 1300 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: Prices first rose and then weakened, then slightly rose again. White goods' leading fine cloth warehouse receipts opened at 46.89 yuan in the morning, and then dropped to 46.1 jiao at noon. In the afternoon, the market sentiment improved due to the rise in futures, and scattered hoarding and collection, rising back to 46.55 jiao, down 5 points from the previous day. Colored goods' Four Gentlemen serge saw a high of 1.5825 yuan in the morning session, and a low of 1.5575 yuan, and the afternoon closing was 1.5675 yuan, also falling slightly by 5 points.

### During the Plum Rain Season, Raincoat Cloth Sales are Strong, Domestic Products are Most Active

Raincoat cloth sales are naturally active during the plum rain season, because there is more rain than usual, causing men's and women's raincoats to be needed more often. Each firm on Wooden Street has a strong volume of raincoat cloth trading. The purchasing of out-of-town traders is also booming now. Western raincoat fabrics have become more famous and widely sold in recent days due to single-sided waterproof rice and solid-colored wool surfaces. Ballyleen is also selling well. Single-sided waterproof rice was sold in batches for 30 yuan per yard, solid-colored wool surfaces were 25 to 26 yuan, and Ballyleen was 27 to 28 yuan. Among Eastern raincoat fabrics, only double-sided gauze is recently available, and most of the rest have been eliminated and are not selling. The number one is selling for 5.70 yuan, and the number two is selling for 5.30 to 5.40 yuan. Domestic raincoat fabrics have increased in recent years, like bamboo shoots after rain. Most of what is commonly held on the market now are domestic goods, with rainproof cloth being the most active and best-selling. Yarn rain cloth ranks second. Western-style raincoats and work clothes are completely exported from these two goods to Southeast Asian ports. The market price of yarn rain cloth is similar to that of Eastern rain cloth. Rainproof cloth has replaced the position of Eastern Ballyleen from before, because there are few weavers, resulting in You Sheng Jin Xiong brand monopolizing the market. Yesterday, Jin Xiong brand rainproof cloth for women was sold in batches for 5.25 yuan per yard, and for men and women, it was sold for 4.70 yuan. It is heard that the factory is busy rushing to deliver orders, so the spot goods are not enough to meet demand.

### Sugar Market Sugar Prices Stable

Yesterday's sugar market trend was stable, with little fluctuation. The association's dividing price: Spot goods, 24 coarse white, foreign warehouse new goods, quoted at 91 yuan, 2 jiao, 1 yuan, April import 89 yuan 1 jiao, March import 88 yuan 5 jiao, 3 jiao. Dutch red is tighter, KD Mark 72 yuan 5 jiao, NT Mark 68 yuan 7 jiao. Taikoo Car White B Mark 106 yuan, Road goods 106 yuan 2 jiao, 4 jiao. DY Mark West Warehouse 95 yuan, HX Mark 89 yuan 5 jiao to 89 yuan, HM Mark 76 yuan, H Mark Car also 67 yuan 1 jiao. This Number One ice is 120 yuan, Jingming ice is 122 yuan. Also, 3156 bags of sugar were delivered from Hong Kong.

### Medicinal Materials Radish Seeds Tight

Radish seeds have been arriving in small quantities recently, and the market is short on inventory, while the demand side is quite keen to acquire them, so the market situation is very tight. Yesterday, the market price was 120 yuan, and some were even calling for 130 to 140 yuan. The trend is very hot.

### Ministry of Education Rectifies the Problem of Student Transfers in Secondary Schools Transfer Certificates Must Specify Grades

(Chongqing Aviation News) The Ministry of Education believes that in recent years, students in various secondary schools have been transferring schools arbitrarily. There are no restrictions at the original school, and the receiving school does not investigate the reason for the transfer, and proceeds to grade students, causing students to arbitrarily transfer schools and affecting the academic atmosphere to a great extent. Strict restrictions must be imposed to rectify the situation. Special regulations are as follows: (1) Transfers are not allowed in the middle of the semester; (2) The transfer certificate must include the grades or a transcript to facilitate verification by the school admitting the transfer student to avoid confusion; (3) Students who are expelled from school shall not be issued a transfer certificate; (4) The school admitting the transfer student shall, within one month after grading, compile a roster of transfer students with detailed notes, from the school, the reason for the transfer, the original school's grades in each subject, and the grading test results, and submit the transfer certificate and transcript to the competent educational administrative authority for approval.

Lecture on Learning

### How to Study English (6)

— Ye Jingfeng

3.  Essays and Exam Papers

The key to composition class is this: don't use words and idioms you're not sure of. Don't write sentences without a solid basis. Never gamble and take chances. If the teacher catches your mistakes, they will correct them. But if they miss them, and we think we've gotten away with it, we're only hurting ourselves. Another key is to write concisely and to the point. Avoid being long-winded and rambling, like "Grandma Wang's bound feet" – you'll only stink yourself. When writing an essay, students should first imagine the expression on their teacher's face while grading papers. Regarding school exams and application essays, I have a "trade secret": incorporate "secret stash" sentences, even whole paragraphs, as long as they're slightly relevant. Quote them artfully, using both direct and indirect quotations, but not too many. This won't guarantee a passing grade, but it increases your chances. The examiner might say you're just regurgitating, but they'll at least acknowledge that you're a diligent student.

Speaking

1.  Ear Training

Many people blame their clumsy tongues for their inability to speak English. But they should blame their ears. If your eardrums don't pick up sounds, how can your mouth pronounce them accurately? Take a record player, for example. It plays back exactly what it records. In spoken English, many sentences are only half-pronounced. Also, many everyday phrases can't be found in books. Therefore, the only solution is to train our ears to distinguish right from wrong and collect as much as we can. If we don't have many foreign friends, how can we collect? On the street, at gatherings, in vehicles, and at talking movies – these are all sources. But even after we've collected these materials, we must carefully screen them to remove the dross and retain the essence.

2.  Face Training

If you refuse to use the materials you've collected, you can't blame your mouth. You have to blame your thin skin. If you're shy and hesitant, your nerves will get in the way, and your newly acquired knowledge will evaporate. The first secret to speaking fluent English is to be bold and thick-skinned. Realize that no one will execute you for making mistakes. If they laugh at you, it's their lack of manners and cultivation that's to blame. However, it's terribly boring to loudly shout a few foreign phrases in public to show off. Also, sometimes we're afraid to speak because we're afraid of making mistakes. This is unnecessary. Foreigners make mistakes too. How many sentences do we speak in Chinese that are grammatically perfect? Besides, overly polished speech sounds like reciting lines. Since we're not acting, why bother memorizing lines?

3.  Tongue Training

Don't only blame your mouth. Blame your tongue too. If you can't speak fluently, it's probably your tongue's fault. The organs of pronunciation – the tongue, teeth, lips, and throat – all make opening and closing movements. But the tongue has the most movements and variations, so it requires a lot of practice.

### An Upstart Family: A "Lay Buddhist" in a Rice Shop

— Zhuma

Old Face, Fake Scholar

One day, I went to the rice shop to pay my three-month rice bill. I carried a stack of legal tender with me, and I also wanted to see Old Fan's annoying face. Speaking of the owner, because I had been a customer for a long time, I had been eating "his" rice ever since I lived in Shanghai. After seven or eight years, we were naturally familiar. But "Dear relatives and friends, small business, no credit, cash only." When it came to money matters, it was best to be straightforward. Although these words were posted on the wall, he was still flexible enough to allow "old customers" to run a tab for a few months. This rice shop started as a "small wooden business," but now it was no longer the same. In the store, five-cent nickel coins were embedded in the floor seams, looking like planted clear and bright minerals, dark and shiny. Outside the store, the gold-lettered signboard was quite impressive. Although, that humble slip of paper was still posted.

When I arrived at the store, the owner's melon-shaped cap was waving in front of my eyes again. We both knew what was going on, but because we were familiar, we understood each other without speaking. We started by asking about business. The owner frowned:

"Losing money, losing money!" Losing what "money"? The Hong Kong rice sold at the door had been removed because the newspaper had reported that this "Bao Hao" was mixing in miscellaneous rice.

But the owner didn't talk much about this. He invited me to sit in that small parlor. Two more sofas had been added to that small parlor, matching the rosewood furniture. "Chinese" and "Western" were not harmonious. The owner pointed to the wall. I looked up and saw that another central painting had been changed. Two wine boats floated in the lotus leaves, with a scholar embracing a beauty in the middle. Earlier, it was just a "Fisherman Gains Profit Picture," but the owner's old-style paintings had improved with the money in his pocket. Now, listen to him say with the eyes of a "connoisseur":

"Uh, look, this piece is so good, it's the handwriting of Shen, uh, the lotus leaves are so fine, uh, it's the real thing, two hundred yuan, I bought it to hang in the summer!"

The owner also took out a piece of jade as big as a goose egg, carefully playing with and stroking it: "You might as well take a look at this thing. This is from the Han Dynasty. This place is...uh!" I quickly nodded and praised it. The owner's "artistic interest" was really high. In recent years, I don't know why, he has been messing around with antiques. According to him, he runs to the "Luying Hall" painting and calligraphy exhibition two or three times every time. People think he is a collector. He also has another nickname: "Snail Hut Layman."

I don't understand. Why does a rice shop owner become so "refined" after having some money? Perhaps, a merchant wants to pretend to be a scholar to embellish his nouveau riche expression…

However, the owner's "son" could not understand his father's heart. Last time, a certain vase fell and broke in half.

The owner complained to me, sighing about the vase. I just smiled.

The owner also asked me to find a few copies of Tang poetry. Of course, he wanted to hum it, but the most important thing was the "Song Edition."

I was too lazy to talk about those elegant things. I hurriedly took out the money I owed the owner and said goodbye: "This time I am returning what I owed before. I have something to do. Goodbye."

The owner was very polite and hurriedly smiled and said, "What's the rush? This little bit is only enough for me to buy that album of figures!"

I had to accompany the "Snail Hut Layman" with a burst of laughter. He felt that this statement was extremely elegant, but I was a little angry, and my hairs stood up like electricity. How terrible the arrogant tone of the merchant.

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(9) A Strange Farmer

"Old Third, shall we go for a walk on the street? It's still early to sleep." After eating, he suggested this.

Autumn Begonia's response was only a shake of his head.

"Third brother, listen to me. You're sure to get sick if you sit here all day feeling depressed!" Wu Da put his right leg on a wooden bench, leaned down, and looked at Autumn Begonia sitting at the head of the table and said, "Are you sad about your sister-in-law again? Actually, the dead are already dead. You are a young man in his thirties, and you should marry another one; if there is a woman in the family, you will be much happier! Is not it?"

As he spoke, he also reached out and patted Autumn Begonia on the shoulder, his face full of smiles, but Autumn Begonia still shook his head silently with no energy.

Wu Da looked at him in contemplation for several minutes.

"Wait a minute, second brother, I'll be back after I go out for a while." He suddenly said this.

Autumn Begonia didn't seem to hear what he said. He still sat at the table in a daze, propping his chin with one hand; after more than a quarter of an hour, Wu Da still didn't return to the room. He seemed to feel that several people were sneaking around at the door, but when he turned around to look, they quickly slipped away.

"These people are simply treating me like a circus!" He felt angry again in his heart, so he immediately jumped up from the orange and wanted to cover the fan

Room door.

But he used too much force, and the building of this small inn was too old. The wooden door was pulled off the tenon at once, forcing him to squat down and try to push the door shaft back to its original position.

"...You want it yourself, old man, how can it not work? That is to pick our money-making things! We--" (141)

### Random Thoughts

— Xin Juan

Obstacles are the only things that make life valuable. Without obstacles, life loses the true joy of victory and success.

A person can only gain true happiness when he or she expresses himself or herself to the fullest in the work he or she is most suitable for and loves the most.

Only the busiest people have time to do things.

Hide your enthusiasm in your heart, accumulate it into a deep reservoir, and that power will give you enough confidence to develop your plans.

### Reservation Fee

— Sun Yifan

My little brother came back with a sad face and said, "Dad, the teacher said that if the reservation fee (ten yuan) is not paid tomorrow, I will not be allowed to continue studying next semester."

Dad really had a headache from the noise, so he promised to pay it tomorrow.

I seem to remember that there was no reservation fee in elementary school before, or if there was, it was at most two yuan, no more than four yuan, but now? As rice and coal rise, so does the reservation fee. Look at the reservation fee notice sent from their school. It is written like this:

"...Our school has complete facilities and serious teaching management, so applicants will definitely be enthusiastic... In order to reserve the places for your children next semester, please come to our school to pay the reservation fee of ten yuan before Monday, otherwise..."

"School store", it really lives up to its name, it is not ironic. Like buying rice and coal, afraid of missing out, you have to pay a deposit in advance.

"What a sin, another one starved to death... Go buy some paper ingots."

### Coercion

— Qishui

——A hungry child's confession

The rice was gone long ago, and I hadn't eaten for two meals. Mom looked at Dad blankly: "We have to think of a way--" Dad shook his head: "There is rice--"

Alas, now I regret it, I shouldn't have said: "Dad, I'm hungry..." Suddenly Dad looked at me..., clenched his fist, and he stood up and left.

Mom was in tears, my sister cried, and my stomach growled.

I also wanted to cry, but I finally "understood" something, and I had to bear the hunger in my stomach! Third Dad didn't turn black and said:

"When you grow up, you have to understand the 'rules'!"

Two dou of rice was delivered by a clerk. …

…I stared at the thing for a long time, and it felt more and more like a pearl. Seeing Mom pour the rice back and forth, I was even more convinced. She moved the rice bowl by bowl..., moved it back and forth several times, but it was still just a few bowls! Really, Mom had better count the rice grain by grain, or weigh it grain by grain, I thought to myself... Mom's eyebrows furrowed again, this time even more severely: "Alas! This kind of rice shop, it's five bowls less again...!" Alas! This kind of rice shop... I read it several times.

Mom always loved us, she cooked thin rice porridge as quickly as possible. …My sister finally had a trace of a smile...

But suddenly, my sister cried with a wow, complaining about the pain in her mouth..., it turned out that the stone hurt her little teeth! I also understood something, I didn't make a sound; let the small stones go round and round in the gaps of my teeth.

My sister is only four years old, I'm afraid she can't accept the "rules" yet! Suddenly, she spat the bowl of thin porridge into Mom's bowl, and it smelled moldy again! ...I wanted to say long ago that this rice had a stale smell, but I wanted to follow the "rules" and was afraid of Third Dad's black face, how could I make a sound?

In the evening, Dad came back, dragging squeaky broken leather shoes, and fell into the chair as soon as he pushed the door open.

I mumbled: "Dad, why do you always order rice from that rice shop? Every time there is always a day's food shortage, today is the same as always...

Dad frowned... but I couldn't help saying:

"...And there are many stones mixed in, and the stale smell is strong, and..." Dad suddenly shook his hand, he seemed to be in pain, and said in a long voice: "Alas!..."

"Dad, rice is cheaper now, didn't you say that the price of rice at this rice shop is always three points higher than others? Huh, if you spend the same money, wouldn't it be better to get rice from another shop?..." Dad just shook his head and sighed, he patted his conscience; he said everything:

"Alas, this rice shop, they are clearly asking me a few yuan more per load, they are selling me more stale rice with more stones, because, because I, I can buy on credit, I owe money! ...They treat me like an old friend? It's been several decisions since I haven't paid the debt, and this time they are still willing to sell on credit, isn't that too polite? No matter good or bad.

Dad stroked his conscience.

### "Scented Movies" Successfully Created

— Xinfang

Since the successful experimentation of "scented movies," it has indeed opened a new era for the film industry. However, although "scented movies" have been publicized for a long time, nothing concrete has been heard about their actual implementation.

In Detroit, USA, there is a cinema called Vogue, which has been equipped with "scented movie" facilities for more than seventeen days. It can be said to be the first cinema in the world to show this kind of film. The results obtained by the cinema are extremely astonishing. Now, let me briefly describe the situation. All movie fans must be happy to know it.

It is said that the rich aroma of coffee when brewing can also be transmitted through the screen to the nostrils of the audience. This kind of film not only directly increases our enjoyment of the film, but also indirectly increases our "oral happiness"! When "Sea Hero" was shown, the crude ropes on the warships used in the film, with the bad smell of tung oil, could actually be distinguished by the audience's sense of smell. "Knightly Hero" used "scented movies" even more: the smell of Clark Gable's cigarette smoking in the film, and the different makeup of Hedy Lamarr and Claudette Colbert were all clearly distinguished. The miracle of "scented movies" is really beyond our expectations!

"Scented movies" were originally invented by a Swiss chemist. The method he used was to chemically compress several easily evaporated substances in certain utensils in advance. When the film is shown, the air conditioning equipment in the cinema can distribute "scents" that match the screen.

Regarding the responses from all walks of life after the cinema showed "scented movies," here are a few excerpts: Once, the cinema used a voting method to collect the audience's opinions on "scented movies." The results showed that 60% felt very satisfied. In addition, 20% thought that the effectiveness of "scented movies" was not strong enough. As for the views expressed by general film merchants, they believe that "scented movies" are not suitable for valuable films.

### Recent Events in the Art World

— Yuanshen

The China Experimental Drama Troupe has been established after a year of planning. The inaugural meeting will be held on the 29th of this month. The troupe is organized by Zhou Yifeng, Xu Zhenglu, Dao Zhuqun, etc. The premiere work "Ransheng Yuan" written by Zhou Yifeng is an anti-feudal social drama. The cast is quite neat, and rehearsals are in full swing, and it will be available to the audience soon.

Cao Yu has had no new works staged in Shanghai for a long time. "Transformation" cannot be staged due to environmental constraints, and "Beijing Man" is still in Hong Kong. Now the Shanghai Drama Troupe has obtained Cao Yu's newly revised work "Gilding" and decided to stage it after "Ode to Righteousness." "Gilding" is a famous comedy, which is adapted from the well-known "Blurred Eyes" in the theater world.

Zhang Min's new work "Bitter Love" has been sent to Hong Kong and sent to Shanghai in batches by Yu Ling.

"Ode to Righteousness" will hold a popular public performance, with the lowest price set. The date is undetermined, but it will be in the morning. This move is purely for the audience who are generally "willing but unable." It is said that the initiator is Shi Hui, who plays "Wen Tianxiang".

Cai Bingbai, the author of Shanghai's Song, recently wrote a comedy for the film, called "Between People", which will be staged with "Flower Girl" at the Russian Art Theatre on July 4. It is said that Mr. Cai's comedy writing is his first work.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 11: Heroic Appearance to Start a Fierce Battle

When they arrived at the Yamen, they laid Wang Yongtai down on the couch and asked a military doctor to treat his arrow wounds. Zhou Yuji and Xu Jing stood by watching, their brows furrowed and unhappy. When the doctor pulled out the two arrows, Wang Yongtai screamed and fainted again. The doctor applied the best golden sore medicine to the wound, but Wang Yongtai was still in a coma, with faint groans in his mouth. Zhou Yuji said to Xu Jing: "Old General Wang's injuries are not light, and I am very worried about him. The bandits are really powerful. They have crossed the Xiaolong River after all. I am afraid they will come to attack the city. If Old General Wang has any misfortune, we..." Before Zhou Yuji could finish speaking, a school officer entered the Yamen and reported that the bandits had advanced to the west gate and were setting up cloud ladders to attack the city. Zhou Yuji hurriedly told Xu Jing to accompany Wang Yongtai here. He immediately left the government office, mounted his war horse, and went to the city to defend it. Xu Jing sat beside Wang Yongtai's sickbed. It was quiet all around, and only the sound of shouting in the distance could be heard. He knew that the bandits were attacking the city very urgently, and he couldn't help feeling a little apprehensive. Suddenly, Wang Yongtai gradually woke up and cried out, "It hurts me to death!" He opened his eyes and saw Xu Jing beside him, so he called out his wise nephew. Xu Jing hurriedly asked: "How is uncle's arrow wound?" Wang Yongtai gasped and said: "I can't do it anymore! The wound is extremely painful. This person of mine is vaguely as if he is in a fog. Alas! From now on, I am afraid I will not be able to hold a spear to defend the country! I am very sorry to General Zhou. After I die, I will have to trouble my wise nephew to collect this stinky skin. I also hope that my wise nephew will work hard for the country and kill the thieves to avenge me. If you can repel the bandits, I will close my eyes even in the underworld." As he spoke, he couldn't stop gasping, and his complexion changed miserably. Xu Jing couldn't help but burst into tears when he heard what he said, and said in a sad voice: Uncle, don't say that. My nephew will never forget Uncle's instructions. I hope that Uncle will eventually be able to turn bad luck into good luck, and after he recovers, he will go to kill the thieves again." Wang Yongtai opened his eyes again and sighed: "Where can I kill the thieves? Alas! I hate it so much, where is General Zhou?" Xu Jing said: General Zhou is defending on the city. What does Uncle have to say? My nephew can convey it for you." (98)

### Green Treasure Ballroom to be Rebuilt into a Theater

— Baiding

The Green Treasure Ballroom at the intersection of Aidoa Road and Gelo Road closed down not long after it opened due to poor business. During that time, someone prepared to buy it and build a theater, but the conditions on both sides were not suitable and the negotiations failed.

Recently, film tycoon Zhang Weitao decided to buy the Green Treasure Ballroom, also with the goal of rebuilding it into a theater.

The Green Treasure Ballroom being rebuilt into a theater has become a reality. After the autumn cools down, it can face the Xuan Palace Theater from afar on the east and west sides of Aidoa Road. Since "China Travel" withdrew from the Xuan Palace, it currently has no permanent base. If the two parties prepare to cooperate, then they can take this opportunity to perform regularly. "China Travel's" "Hong Xuanjiao" will perform "Night Luminous Cup" adapted into "Grape Wine". If the negotiations are successful, it can be performed at the Green Treasure Ballroom.

Brief News (1) Since the five-act historical drama "Yue Fei" has been performed at the Lyceum Theatre, the box office has been very good. The plot of the play is tense, tragic and moving, coupled with the brand-new scenery and the dedicated performance of the actors, which has greatly improved the play. (2) For the purpose of helping educational loans, the "China 7 Drama Troupe" will hold the second public performance of "At the Beginning of Human Life" at the Russian Art Theatre on the 27th of this month. Its wonderful performance is sure to be expected.

### Zhou Xuan's Way Out

— Xing

Zhou Xuan's sudden departure and proposal for a divorce after her breakup with Yan Hua has become a major event in the art world. Yesterday, many people from the cultural world discussed this issue, and the results are as follows: Zhou Xuan's departure after feeling unreasonably oppressed by Yan Hua and her request for a divorce should indeed be sympathized with, but after leaving, she should devote herself to a bright path, such as going to the mainland to work in film, etc. It is a pity that she will always be in a dark environment!

### Brief Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden

— Written by Someone Who Knows Both Southern and Northern Styles, Illustrated by Zhang Yuwozhang

(Sixteenth) Shang Xiaoyun

Shang Xiaoyun, courtesy name Qixia, also known as Master of Fangxin Studio, is originally from Beiping. He studied acting at the Zheng Le She training school from a young age. After completing his training and debuting on stage, his fellow townsman Sun Juxian supported him wholeheartedly, personally arranging various plays such as "San Niang Teaches Her Son." His fame arrived earlier than that of Xun Huisheng. When he initially decided to come south, Xiaoyun was a leading Qingyi actress, while Huisheng was a second-tier Dan actress. Gradually, he and Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, and Xun Huisheng were praised as the four great Dan actresses. Among the four, Xiaoyun's reputation is considered the most substantial. As for his private humility, amiability, generosity, and liberality, Xiaoyun stands out. If someone in the Pear Garden is struggling financially and seeks help from Shang, he gives generously without any stinginess. Whenever someone wants to invite him to perform, he doesn't calculate how much his own fee is, but only cares that the supporting actors in the troupe can be adequately provided for. Therefore, people in the industry all appreciate him. He has a younger brother, Fuxia, who was a Dan actress in the third class of the Fu Lian Cheng training school, but later switched to playing young male roles. He now performs with Xiaoyun.
