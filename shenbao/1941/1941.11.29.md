### Economic Conference Carefully Discusses, Strictly Implements Price Control Measures, Strengthens Inspection Efforts to Thoroughly Stabilize Prices, Uses Political Power in Addition to Economic Power

Chongqing. Yesterday's economic conference decided to accelerate the implementation of price control measures by relevant authorities, strengthen investigation and inspection work, in order to achieve the goal of thoroughly stabilizing prices as soon as possible. The conference also announced the original work implementation outline, which includes four parts: Division of powers, stipulating that the Economic Conference is the highest national price control and monopoly agency, under which the Ministry of Food is responsible for food, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for industrial and mining products, and daily necessities, the Ministry of Social Affairs is responsible for wages, and the Ministry of Transportation and the Transportation Control Bureau are responsible for freight rates. In addition, the Four Banks Joint Office is responsible for planning price stabilization funds. Price investigation: The conference will first investigate the market price of clothing, food, fuel, daily necessities and industrial raw materials in Chongqing, as well as the supply in Chongqing, and then investigate the prices in the production and assembly areas of these goods to determine the parity price. This work must also be extended to other important cities. Implementation of management: According to the above investigation, if the Economic Conference predicts that a certain item will rise in price, it will immediately notify the competent authority to take preventive measures. If it has already risen, it will propose urgent and effective methods to curb it. The method is mainly to use economic power, and if it is not enough, political power can be used. Business adjustment: Price control agencies should coordinate the source of materials, widely set up supply stations, and assist cooperatives to universally supply parity goods, and should entrust stores to act as purchasing and sales agents to expand the circulation circle.

Chongqing. Many proposals regarding prices were raised at this National Political Council meeting. Although no specific measures were proposed, many illegal situations were exposed. What is more noteworthy is the people's mentality reflected in the discussion. When the Economic Conference held a plenary meeting in the Executive Yuan today, Chairman Chiang himself presided over the meeting. The results of the discussion have not yet been announced, but it is said that a decision was made to strictly implement various price control measures and prohibitions on hoarding and speculation. Among them, special attention will be paid to strictly prohibiting banks from buying and selling goods or engaging in such activities in the name of commercial firms. If civil servants are found to have such behavior, they will be severely punished. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)

### Points for Attention Regarding Government Ministries' Work Reports Raised by the National Political Council, Paying Tribute to the Commander-in-Chief and All Officers and Soldiers on Behalf of the People

Chongqing. The various ministries of the government submitted detailed reports to this National Political Council. In addition to written reports, the heads of the various ministries also gave oral reports to the conference. After accepting the reports, the National Political Council submitted them to various groups for review and attached detailed opinions to the conference for approval before submitting them to the government for adoption in order to improve. The points of attention raised by the conference on the work of the various ministries of the government are recorded as follows:

Military Affairs: After listening to the government's military report, the Council is greatly comforted. Over the past eight months, the various battlefields in Jiangnan have been able to adhere to the Commander-in-Chief's intentions, strive for initiative in various battles, and achieve considerable results. Other war zones without battles have also been able to secure the battlefield and continue to implement our goal of depleting the Japanese. Although the Japanese have increased their troops, our army has still been able to recover Fuzhou and Zhengzhou, crush the Japanese offensives in Shanggao, and stabilize the war zones in various places. All of this is clear evidence that our army is becoming increasingly superior. In terms of military reorganization, it has been able to proceed on schedule according to the planned plan, which is even more progress. Regarding political training, military management and political training have been coordinated. Regarding supplies, the rules for distribution have been revised according to local conditions, and the replenishment of soldiers has also been carried out according to plan. Transportation, hygiene, communications, and air defense equipment have been further strengthened, making our army's maneuverability increasingly enhanced. All of this is clear evidence that our army's strength is increasing. Under the command of the Supreme Commander, our entire army is becoming increasingly favorable in terms of momentum and strength. We cannot but represent the people of the whole country and pay our respects to our Commander-in-Chief and all officers and soldiers. The Council summarizes the public opinion and expresses its expectations to the military authorities in four points: Ensuring the source of troops: The conscription of recruits should comply with the three-year principle. Grain, clothing, and blankets should be provided in a timely manner during the conscription process, and the publicity and promotion of military service should also be carried out effectively. Improving supplies: Attention should be paid to the nutritional requirements of soldiers, and clothing, shoes, and military blankets should be sufficient for distribution. The facilities for medical care in field positions should be further improved. The government is expected to pay close attention to all of this. Strengthening training: Military reorganization is proceeding on schedule, and spiritual education is the main factor in reorganization. Strict military discipline: Please refer to the Council's past resolutions on strictly enforcing military discipline and unifying military orders, clarifying rewards and punishments, consolidating military morale, so that our entire army can become a whole fighting body to strive for the final victory and complete the great cause of fighting.

Foreign Affairs: The report on foreign affairs work shows that the government has been able to continue its efforts to strengthen its ties and cooperation with friendly countries such as the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in accordance with its established national policy. It is also in the process of promoting and establishing diplomatic relations with other friendly countries. The foreign affairs authorities have also paid attention to matters such as adjusting and strengthening embassies and consulates abroad, improving intelligence, cultivating talent, and safeguarding the safety and welfare of overseas Chinese. The Council deeply hopes that the foreign affairs authorities will implement the above-mentioned work guidelines and strive to achieve them as soon as possible. Regarding the adjustment of embassies and consulates and the cultivation of talent, the Council believes that the following matters should be brought to the attention of the foreign affairs authorities and handled effectively: The purpose of the training class should be to ensure that there are specialists in foreign affairs for any country in the future. The cultivation of foreign affairs talent should also pay attention to enriching their knowledge of the country's culture and history. Foreign affairs agencies should establish links with education and examination agencies to ensure that students in the political and foreign affairs departments of universities and those who are admitted through foreign affairs examinations receive sufficient specialized and general knowledge to facilitate their future performance of duties.

### Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Japan Enter an Extremely Delicate Stage, Will Gradually Deteriorate Under Economic Sanctions, Roosevelt's Trip to Warm Springs for Negotiations Has Been Shelved

United Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th: President Roosevelt met with Kurusu and Nomura for 45 minutes yesterday. It is now rumored that Tokyo's response to the United States' strong policy statement on Pacific peace may be an attack on Thailand within a few days. Whether Japan originally intended to continue negotiations is not indicated. The shelving of this negotiation is obviously due to the sudden hardening of the United States' attitude and the announcement of its policy. When Kurusu walked out of the White House, reporters asked questions one after another. He shook his head and showed a slight anger. He said that he knew nothing about the rumored Japanese attack on Thailand. Sources in the diplomatic circle said that the United States' strong statement actually ended the hope of resolving the Far East issue. After several meetings, Hull changed from his conciliatory tone to a strong reaffirmation of the principles of the United States' basic foreign policy. Most people believe that this deterioration will be prolonged without a sharp or sudden break. It is generally believed that US-Japan relations will gradually deteriorate under continued economic sanctions.

Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 28th: Kurusu and Nomura told reporters after the meeting at the White House yesterday afternoon that they had a very friendly conversation with President Roosevelt. When asked whether the negotiations to resolve the US-Japan issue would be reopened, Kurusu replied that he had not received orders to return home, but did not say whether he would meet with Secretary of State Hull again in the next few days. Reporters also asked whether the US proposal received on Wednesday provided a basis for continued negotiations. Nomura replied that he had not received instructions from Tokyo and could not answer. Well-informed sources here believe that yesterday's meeting was of particular importance in the current stage of discussions. Hull remained at the White House for a quarter of an hour after the Japanese ambassadors left to talk to the President. When asked whether he intended to meet with the Japanese representatives again, Hull replied that he had no appointment with the Japanese representatives.

Reuters dispatch from New York on the 28th: Although the Japanese envoys are still in Washington, President Roosevelt has scheduled to go to Warm Springs for vacation today and return to Washington around Wednesday. The New York Times pointed out in an editorial today that the US-Japan talks have not broken down, but said that the basic positions of the two governments are far apart. For its own security interests, the United States vows to provide assistance to all countries resisting aggression and will continue to aid China. The newspaper finally warned Japan not to assume that the United States, because it has greater obligations in the Atlantic, is powerless to act in the Pacific. New York, dispatch on the 27th: Well-informed and qualified people in Washington mostly believe that the US-Japan talks, which have lasted for twelve days, may be declared to have broken down at any time. From the perspective of the situation in the Pacific, this has gradually had a good impact on the future of the general democratic countries, especially on the future of China. The worries and pessimism held by some parties have also gradually been dispelled. The US government has decided to firmly adhere to the basic principles clarified by Secretary of State Hull in the past, believing that all issues in the Pacific should be based on this principle in order to seek a final solution. Most US newspapers today published the news that Hull presented Kurusu with a document in a prominent position. The headlines used mostly said "The United States Has Refused to Accept a Munich on the Pacific." Kurusu's visit to the US President today failed to improve the tense relations between the US and Japan. Although Kurusu denied the claim that he intended to return to Japan in a short period of time, it is generally believed that Kurusu may intend to return home soon. Observers said that Hull's presentation of the document to Kurusu was the final step taken by the US side, and the second step should be taken by the Japanese side.

United Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th: The US-Japan talks, which are related to the Pacific war and peace, are said to be on the verge of collapse. Observers said that the answer can be obtained when Tokyo replies to the US proposal on Wednesday night. Their pessimistic mood was heightened by the rumor that Tokyo's strong policy statement to the United States may be an attack on Thailand within a few days. President Roosevelt is understood to have reiterated the US position to the Japanese envoys in clear terms. It is learned that President Roosevelt emphasized that the United States will not retreat from its basic policy in the Far East.

Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 28th: Although general opinion here believes that the situation in Japan is extremely serious, some observers still believe that Japan is currently using its intimidation tactics. Two senators held this view today, one being Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a Democrat, who said that although the situation has reached boiling point, it will not boil over. The other is Senator George, former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a Democrat, who said that the movement of Japanese troops towards the Thai border is mostly for intimidation.

United Press dispatch from Gary on the 28th: The Japanese ambassador to Peru, Sakamoto, flew to Washington yesterday to consult with Kurusu and Nomura.

Japan Uses Period of Quiet to Deploy New Offensive Positions

Reuters dispatch from Singapore on the 28th: The news that the US-Japan talks have stalled has put the entire Far East in a state of anticipation. Although officials here have refused to make any speculation about future developments, they all believe that various events may occur. According to some people, although the Japanese army in China and other places has shown little activity in recent weeks, it should be known that this does not mean that the Japanese army is not preparing for action, and there is various evidence that the Japanese army is using this period of quiet to deploy new positions, so that once Tokyo sends a signal, it can launch a rapid attack.

Reuters dispatch from London on the 28th: The US-Japan talks in Washington are now apparently approaching the final stage. British newspapers have published contradictory news that a limited agreement will be concluded momentarily and that the negotiations have now failed. However, according to well-informed sources, the news received so far from the Washington talks is purely speculative, and no sign of progress in the talks has been obtained, nor has the hope of a quick result been estimated. The scope of the talks cannot be estimated either. However, any proposal made by the Japanese envoys must first be studied with extreme caution by the United States before it can consider easing the economic pressure currently being applied.

United Press dispatch from London on the 18th: Here yesterday, the reports from Washington said that the United States had decided to abandon the attempt to reconcile with Japan, and all expressed skeptical welcome. Although there is this pessimistic report from Washington, there is still a hope for reconciliation in the establishment of a three-month agreement to maintain the status quo in the Pacific, while the basic points of disagreement between the US and Japan remain to be explored. Observers believe that the requests of Chinese Ambassador Hu Shi and Economic Representative Song Ziwen in Washington to President Roosevelt will not cause the government's attitude to change suddenly. As for the rumored willingness of the United States to lift part of the economic sanctions against Japan, non-official critics are taking two distinct attitudes: to make reasonable concessions after obtaining an agreement from the Japanese side; to fear that after Japan breaks through the principle of establishing economic sanctions, it will further expand its original intention to achieve countermeasures.

### Japanese Cabinet Held Regular Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Contents of US Note

Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 28th: In the regular Cabinet meeting this morning, Foreign Minister Togo reported to government officials on the contents of Hull's note to the Japanese special envoy. The Cabinet then discussed the US-Japan talks. Before the meeting, the Prime Minister met with the Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, the Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, and the Vice Minister of the Army.

Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 28th: The US-Japan dispute apparently hinges on whether Hull's note to the Japanese envoy is a counter-proposal from the United States that requires a Japanese response, or whether the US Secretary of State has given a final answer to the talks that have been going on since April. This morning, Information Bureau spokesman Kiishi Kazuoichi stated that the US-Japan talks in Washington are still in progress. Tokyo received Hull's note to the Japanese special envoy last night and is currently conducting close research. The spokesman refused to criticize the contents of the note and refused to state whether or when Japan would respond. The spokesman mentioned the meeting held by Hull with the representatives of China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands, saying that the United States is conducting this talk as a matter of caution, because the US-Japan negotiations naturally involve the interests of other powers in the Far East, so this action has to be taken. Today, the editorial of the news agency that sells newspapers reiterated Japan's determination to implement the principles listed by Prime Minister Tojo, and continued, "If the United States still insists on absolute principles and disregards Japan's conditions for a peaceful solution to the Pacific issue, there is little or no room for the current US-Japan talks to have a successful outcome. The success or failure of the talks will depend on the talks that continue based on Japan's reply." Kiishi Kazuoichi also told news reporters about the newspapers' claim that any temporary agreement will be rejected, saying that this is the voice of the Japanese people, and the government must pay attention to it.

US Adopts Tough Stance, Japanese Side Says Situation is Critical

United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 28th: The Allied News Agency issued a serious warning today, saying that the Pacific situation is critical because the US attitude towards Japan has become tougher. It also said that Hull's note to the Japanese ambassador indicates that the US negotiations have been decided, and judging from the situation in all aspects, hope is minimal, and the hope for the continuation of the negotiations is also minimal. The Allied News Agency indicated that Japan may also take a tough stance, and said that because of Hull's note, there is no opportunity for the US-Japan situation. It concluded by saying that the reason why Britain is very optimistic about the results of the US-Japan negotiations is because Britain still hopes to maintain the status quo in the Pacific. The Asahi Shimbun said that the success or failure of the negotiations depends entirely on whether the US note can uphold Japan's national position. It also said that Hull's note is believed to be the US's final word on the negotiations. If the United States recognizes Japan's views, US-Japan relations may be adjusted again, and the situation in the Pacific may be maintained in its tranquil state, as the name "Pacific" expresses it. Otherwise, if Japan's existence, rights, and interests are threatened, Japan will proceed with its firm determination. It also said, "We are prepared to deal with any situation."

United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 28th: The Japanese newspaper explained today that Hull's note to the Japanese ambassador yesterday was the US's final demand and predicted that the negotiations were nearing collapse. The Asahi Shimbun said that if Japan cannot accept the US's final demand, Japan will reject it with an unwavering determination. The current situation has decided, we are watching the actions of fate and preparing to deal with any future events. The Chugai Commercial News said that senior Japanese government officials will discuss the details of Hull's note today. The newspaper, which has always represented the government's views, is said to have said that Japan's instructions on the note will determine the fate of the negotiations in Washington, and also pointed out that the document has a disrespectful attitude.

### Army in Hawaii On Alert

United Press dispatch from Honolulu on the 28th: The entire army in Hawaii was ordered to be on alert today. Armed soldiers are patrolling military centers, bridges, and highways everywhere. Authorities refused to declare whether the order for this sudden alert was related to the Pacific crisis. It is recalled that the same order was issued several months ago when Japanese funds were frozen. It is learned that the army has been on alert in various parts of the island for several weeks.

### Kaya's Speech

Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 28th: Minister of Finance Kaya gave a speech, saying that if Japan fails in China, the future will be unimaginable. Not only will North China lose its current form, but Manchuria may also be spared. If Japan makes a slight mistake at the moment, it will return to the position of 1895, with its hands and feet bound, unable to move beyond the islands.

The Thai Prime Minister reiterated Thailand's independence, urged the people to remain united and avoid conflicts with outsiders, and said that if we can find a way to avoid war, the future will be very bright. According to Singapore Radio, Sangar also asked his countrymen not to view Vietnamese or Malay soldiers as troops about to invade Thailand, as he had received assurances from Britain, the United States, and others to respect Thailand's independence, and Japan had also stated that it would do its best to promote friendly relations and guaranteed that the Japanese troops in Vietnam had no intention of invading Thailand.

Editorial

### Problems Urgently Awaiting Resolution

No threat to life is as serious as housing, just as is the case with food. This problem has arisen with the occurrence of war. Although there is hope that prices will be stabilized, the heavy exactions of rent, tips, key money, search fees, and security deposits continue unabated. New tenants are faced with the severe conditions for renting houses that are what they are, "Take it or leave it." This is the proud response from landlords and rental agents. Old tenants are suffering more and more from rent increases. Some landlords use foreign merchants as intermediaries to increase rents and evict tenants. Some use hooligans to force tenants to accept rent increases. Others hire vagrants with special backgrounds to abuse good tenants, who can only swallow their anger and comply with their extravagant demands. Some falsely claim that the entire building is being sold, selling each unit separately, taking it back for their own use, and forcing tenants to move out. Others disregard everything, demolish old houses, drive out old tenants, and rebuild new houses in order to demand high rents and other extraordinary gratuities. Some even cut off water and electricity when rent increases are not agreed upon, making it difficult for tenants to cook or see in the dark, regardless of the risk of fire and theft. Do these people not realize that what they do to others today may be done to them tomorrow? Do they not think that the mills of God grind slowly but surely? The retribution for hoarders and speculators is often unimaginable. It is understandable to demand high rents for magnificent buildings. However, the residents of alley houses and small to medium-sized buildings are mostly ordinary laborers and wage earners. Landlords should be able to make a reasonable profit, but to compete with speculators and hoarders is to treat real estate as a commodity for speculation and to manipulate rents. This is as harmful to public life as hoarding, but it is not treated the same as controlling essential goods. This not only fails to deter hoarders but also leaves the public unconvinced. There are precedents for curbing rent increases, and essential goods are not limited to food. Therefore, it is essential to eliminate the threats and exactions imposed by landlords and to alleviate the endless suffering of tenants.

However, unscrupulous sub-landlords who oppress sub-tenants are even more guilty than the main landlords. In addition to excessive rent increases, they also demand security deposits and extra fees. A living room on a floor may be rented for eighty or ninety yuan, with extra fees of one or two thousand yuan. In other cases, a single wing room may be rented for one hundred and sixty yuan per month, with a three thousand yuan gratuity and a four thousand four hundred yuan security deposit. Such black-hearted sub-landlords are rare, but there are many similar cases. As a result, some people use renting as a form of speculation, using every possible means to find houses and then subletting them for huge profits. In addition, sub-landlords impose restrictions on sub-tenants regarding water usage, electricity usage, the number of people in a family, the number of children, the frequency of visitors, the location of cooking, and the restrictions on daily life. All these harsh rules are designed to restrict subtenants. They rent out every possible space in the house, front and back, up and down, the drying platform, and the stove shed. They do not care about the number of people living in the house, whether it is light or dark, whether the air is bad, whether diseases can spread, or whether access is obstructed. They do not think about how to cope with disasters. They only seek huge profits and still enjoy the maximum right to use the property. This directly attacks sub-tenants, increases rents excessively, and indirectly damages public health and endangers local safety. They are vermin of the people and parasites of society. If they are not severely punished, even if the main landlords consider the plight of the tenants and do not go too far, there is still no hope of solving the general housing problem.

Housing has become so speculative that there are still buyers for newly built houses and apartments for rent or sale, no matter how many are built. Sub-rents are extortionate and extraordinarily high, yet there is no shortage of tenants. This means that people are willing to accept harsh conditions, and one cannot simply blame the insatiable demands of landlords. It is important to understand that supply creates demand, and there are great disparities in suffering and pleasure, which cannot be generalized. Sub-renting is popular despite the high rents and gratuities because tenants are often evicted for no reason and must find a place to live, moving frequently and reluctantly accepting the situation, regardless of the exorbitant rents and gratuities. Secondly, anyone who has traveled in the interior knows the hardships and inconveniences, which makes the hope of dispersing the population of Shanghai unrealistic, and the housing problem remains difficult to solve. Thirdly, the prevalence of speculation in Shanghai attracts people from the interior to concentrate in Shanghai, which further increases the difficulty of the housing problem. As for the sale of real estate, regardless of how high prices rise, there are still buyers because: (1) Wealthy people from the interior who are avoiding Shanghai have suffered greatly from the oppression of large and sub-landlords and are willing to pay a high price to find a new home to relieve their anger and enjoy a peaceful life. (2) The exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai is so different that buying Shanghai property with Hong Kong dollars is still the best deal, and real estate is both an investment and a speculative target. (3) Jewish people who have been driven to Shanghai are contacting old friends in Shanghai and using their familiar skills in buying and selling real estate and stocks to pursue huge profits. (4) People who generally consider legal tender to be worthless are hoarding goods and also collecting real estate, not only in Shanghai but also in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuchang. (5) There are too many newly rich people in the past one or two years who are spending their windfall on real estate, regardless of the high prices, as a way to preserve their wealth and enjoy a comfortable life, so they flock to it like ducks to water. From this perspective, the general public is nothing more than meat on the landlord's chopping block. The special circumstances cannot be used as a benchmark for rents, and are unique to the newly rich phenomenon. It is lamentable to be meat on a chopping block, and unless there is improvement, how can we face the public?

How can we improve the general rental situation? It is very difficult! The appeals of the people and the expressions of public opinion have gone unanswered. The focus is not only on the fact that real estate owners have long sleeves and are good at dancing, and that their voices are widely heard, but also on the fact that so-called taxpayers are real estate taxpayers! Can the representatives produced in this way truly prioritize the welfare of the public, or can they forget the interests of the class they represent? Furthermore, the increase in real estate rents can indirectly increase public revenue, which can be used to supplement the frequent increases in salaries. Therefore, it is difficult to suppress real estate rents and reduce public revenue. As a result, the main landlords can be allowed to do as they please, but why should the sub-landlords be singled out for suppression? However, this is not to say that public servants should not be impartial, as once they are in public service, they should forget their personal interests and think about the welfare of the public. The housing problem cannot be ignored. Improving the rental situation will not infringe on the legitimate interests of the landlords. The public hopes to eliminate exorbitant demands and curb insatiable exactions! Can the authorities in the two concessions rely on the Import Association to control retail prices, but not use the Real Estate Association to suppress real estate prices? The majority of real estate in Shanghai today is: (1) owned by foreign merchants; (2) owned by Chinese merchants, but mostly registered and managed by foreign merchants; (3) owned by bank trusts and real estate management offices. Gathering representatives from these three groups to solve the rent problem should be easily resolved. If there are solutions for the rents of the main landlords, it should not be difficult to strictly suppress the greed of the sub-landlords. The key to suppression is: (1) Rent should be standardized based on a certain period, and should not be increased thereafter. By standardizing rent based on a certain period, the landlord's existing interests will not be damaged. However, there may be discrepancies in determining the period, either using the average of the past few years or the rent for a certain period this year. The principle should be fairness. (2) All gratuities and miscellaneous fees other than security deposits (limited to a maximum of three months) should be prohibited. Violators will have the fees confiscated and returned to the person who paid them, and will also be fined the same amount. (3) Key money should be limited to the actual cost of renovation and the deposit for furniture. (4) Sub-landlords should publicly disclose rent receipts to tenants. The method of dividing rent should be based on the rent, taxes, electricity bill (or water bill), and the necessary repair costs, or the profits that can be made, and should be distributed proportionally based on the location, size, and quality of the rented room. If the total rent exceeds a certain percentage, the tenant may report the matter for investigation, even if they have already rented the property. (5) Leases should not be terminated unless the tenant is in arrears with rent, the landlord needs to take back the property for their own use, or the tenant has other illegal or improper behavior. (6) Rent should not be increased without a legitimate reason; even if rent is increased, the concession authorities must be notified and an investigation must be conducted with the tenants before approval is granted. (7) If the adjustment or restriction of general rent does cause a loss of tax revenue to the concession, the amount of the shortfall may be compensated by increasing the property tax. (8) Those who use housing as a tool for speculation and profit should be punished.

All of the above is not intended to promote the decline of the real estate industry, but to maintain the mutual interests of landlords, tenants, and sub-tenants in order to safeguard the people's livelihood. This is an urgent measure that should not be seen as a long-term plan.

### German Forces Concentrate Strength, Fiercely Attack Moscow's Flanks, Both Sides Have Begun a "War of Destruction," British and American Fighters Deployed to the Front Lines

TASS, Central Front, 28th – A Pravda correspondent reports that the enemy has concentrated its forces to fiercely attack Moscow's flanks in the past few days. The enemy has made progress, but its tank and infantry supplies are becoming more difficult. Our army's resistance is extremely fierce, and the German losses are very heavy. From November 15th to 26th, the Germans lost 330 tanks on the Moscow front. Such heavy losses will make it impossible for the Germans to last. Although the threat to Moscow has increased, every defender of Moscow must fight the advancing enemy with greater courage and determination.

TASS, Central Front, 28th – A Pravda correspondent reports that in the past 24 hours, the fighting on the central front has been most intense in the Klin (50 kilometers from Moscow) and Volokolamsk areas. In the Klin area, the enemy's attempt to advance southwards failed, so they advanced northeastwards with three divisions and made some progress eastward. In the Volokolamsk area, the enemy also made slight progress and occupied point X, which had been fought over for several days. In the Tula area, the enemy also attempted to advance, but was severely damaged during the attack. On the Stalinogorsk line, our army held its ground and repulsed the enemy's offensive. In the past 24 hours, our air force destroyed 19 tanks and 160 trucks on the central front, and annihilated one enemy infantry battalion and one cavalry squadron.

TASS, Central Front, 28th – The German offensive on Moscow has lasted for 11 days. Although the battlefield is littered with German corpses, the German commanders are still threatening their soldiers, ordering them to advance, and declaring that the German army will fail completely if it does not occupy Moscow. The situation in the Volokolamsk area is the most tense, with the Germans attacking with six tank divisions and five infantry divisions in an attempt to encircle our army, but they have not succeeded. In the past 24 hours, the situation has become even more serious. Our army is still resisting calmly. The German army has discovered that it is attacking at a great cost, and the results are not very significant.

United Press, Kubyshev, 28th – British and American fighters were deployed on the Moscow front yesterday, while German armored units fiercely attacked the stubbornly resistant Soviet positions in a major battle to capture the Soviet capital. According to the latest news, a "war of destruction" has broken out on all fronts, with the Germans and Soviets refusing to give way. The fighting on all lines is extremely tense.

TASS, Kalinin, 28th – In the past few days, German forces have repeatedly attempted to break through our army's positions in the Kalinin area, but have been repulsed by our army. Yesterday, our army launched a counteroffensive, breaking into the enemy's positions and retaking seven villages. Our air force assisted the infantry in the counteroffensive, killing more than 700 enemy soldiers and destroying many enemy tanks and military vehicles. Our army is continuing its counteroffensive.

Soviet Union Uses New Aircraft to Destroy Steel-Clad Locusts

TASS, Moscow, 28th – Aircraft designer Ilyushin has been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor of the Soviet Union. Pravda wrote that Bakhmutov and Ilyushin were pioneers in military aviation. The aircraft they designed set records and became famous throughout the world. They not only worked hard on aircraft technology, but also invented a new type of anti-tank attack aircraft. This type of aircraft is equipped with machine guns and cannons that can counter enemy mechanized units. The value of anti-tank aircraft has been proven in battle. Soviet anti-tank aircraft are now destroying the fascist steel-clad locusts.

TASS, Moscow, 28th – On the 27th, our army fought the enemy on all fronts. On the 26th, 19 German aircraft were shot down, while we lost four. On the 27th, 15 German aircraft were shot down near Moscow. Also, on the 26th, our air force destroyed a total of 105 enemy tanks, 600 trucks carrying enemy infantry, 190 ammunition trucks, and annihilated one enemy infantry regiment.

TASS, Moscow, 28th – A correspondent for Izvestia reports from Sevastopol that the Germans are paying a heavy price for their offensive on Crimea. The Romanian troops, who are helping the Germans, originally planned to rest after the Battle of Odessa, but are now still being used by the Germans to fight. According to reliable statistics, the German losses in Crimea have exceeded 100,000 men. The German losses in the Sevastopol area are particularly heavy. At present, the Red Army and the Black Sea Fleet are still inflicting heavy damage on the enemy every day.

TASS, Northern Front, 28th – A Pravda correspondent reports that there were local battles of importance at various points on the northern front yesterday. Our army held its ground and launched counterattacks. Strong enemy defenses were retaken by our army. The German 32nd Division's 96th Regiment suffered heavy losses, with 400 men killed in action. Our air force bombed the enemy's headquarters and artillery positions with great success. The fighting is still continuing.

TASS, Stockholm, 28th – The Germans are currently conducting a purge of the Sturmabteilung (Storm Troopers). It is claimed that 100 Sturmabteilung leaders were arrested in the first half of November because they were dissatisfied with the heavy losses on the Eastern Front. According to reliable sources, more than 250,000 German Sturmabteilung soldiers have been killed in action on the Eastern Front.

### Allied Forces Meet Southeast of Tobruk, British Army Increases Armor Car Strength, Can Control Entire Battlefield in Future

Reuters, London, 28th – A Middle East British Army communiqué states that British and New Zealand troops who met southeast of Tobruk yesterday are now advancing westward under fierce resistance from Axis forces, while enemy columns attempting to cross into Egypt have now begun to turn back westward to join the main German and Italian forces west of El Agheila, which were severely defeated by the British Eighth Army. British armored units heavily damaged this enemy force that had crossed the border. After two hours of fierce fighting, it was defeated, and a large number of tanks retreated northwest to Gambut. Reliable sources here say that the British army in the Western Desert is still fighting to strengthen its connection with the garrison in Tobruk. The meeting of the New Zealand vanguard with the garrison there will allow the British army to use it as a supply base, which the German army is doing everything possible to prevent. Both sides have been constantly repairing tanks damaged in recent battles in the past two days, foreshadowing a major battle that is about to break out.

Reuters, Libya, 28th – The main force of the British armored vehicles is now busy reorganizing and strengthening its strength in preparation for the next armored battle. Judging from the current situation, the next battle will be able to control the entire battlefield, and there is hope for a great victory. During the lull in last week's tank battle, German General Rommel broke through the left flank of the British army on Sunday night with a mobile column in an attempt to contain the British forces south and southwest of Tobruk. Twelve hours later, a small squadron of tanks arrived, and the two forces met and charged to a point on the southern border of Sidi Omar, which was occupied by the British Indian troops last week, but was attacked by British tanks and South African armored vehicles. As a result, part of the enemy column headed south towards the Halfaya Pass, and part attempted to turn back to its own positions, while the remainder resisted our army's frontal attack near the border.

### Gondar's Italian Garrison Surrenders to British

### Complete Withdrawal of American Troops Yesterday Morning: Enthusiastic Farewell, Two Patrol Ships to Follow, US Authorities Urge American Nationals to Return Home Quickly, Difficulties with Pacific Shipping, Further Delay May Make Ship Allocation Impossible

The Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, ordered to withdraw from Shanghai, its Second Battalion having already departed on the Madison轮 a few days ago for Manila, the remaining First Battalion and headquarters personnel, a total of 335 soldiers and 69 officers, personally led by Commander Colonel Howard, left Shanghai on the Harrison President 轮 at 1 pm yesterday, ending their 14-year history in China. Chinese and foreign personages, considering the team's time in Shanghai and its considerable contributions to maintaining local security and protecting the lives and property of the people, flocked to the Customs Wharf to see them off, admiring their demeanor with even greater enthusiasm than the previous morning. Another 57 expatriates accompanied the ship to the Philippines.

Parade in Formation

The First Battalion and headquarters officers and soldiers, more than 400 in total, departed from their barracks at 196 Xiaoshadu Road at 9 am yesterday. Despite the cold wind and the sadness of parting, the spirit of the entire unit was very high. The procession was led by the Police Department's patrol car team, followed by the team's military band, conducted by Captain Jiffin, then more than 300 American soldiers, with Commander Colonel Howard and his staff bringing up the rear. The procession included the Commissioner of Police, British and American expatriates, and the soldiers' wives and close friends. This last group of American troops withdrawing from Shanghai embarked on their journey to bid farewell to the people of Shanghai, accompanied by the majestic military music. Universal Pictures also sent a film car to follow the procession and capture the scenes along the way.

Chinese and Foreign Farewell

The unit proceeded along Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road to the Customs Wharf. All along the way, one could hear military music and cheers from the crowds. As the unit turned east from Jing'an Temple Road, the well-wishers and participants became even more crowded, with Nanjing Road packed with people and traffic blocked. Expatriates overlooking from the Huizhong Hotel scattered colored confetti and streamers as the procession passed, making for a spectacular sight. At 9:30 am, they arrived at the Customs Wharf, where more than 10,000 Chinese and foreign well-wishers had gathered. In addition to the Customs Wharf, numbers 11 and 9 on the Bund were also packed, with no room to set foot. The Shanghai Municipal Police dispatched two red police vehicles and more than 20 Chinese and foreign detectives to form a large circle on both sides of the wharf to maintain order and control traffic.

Distinguished Guests at the Wharf to See Them Off

Among those who went to the wharf to see them off yesterday were diplomatic envoys and military representatives from various countries, including Captain Atteg of the French Defense Forces, Staff Officer Frolin, Hasegawa, Commander of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, Colonel Sakato, Captain Kawaii, representing the Japanese Navy, and representatives from the British Navy. Diplomatic representatives included British Consul-General George, American Acting Consul-General Stanton, Dutch Consul-General Bowen, Polish Chargé d'Affaires Rosset, Czech Chargé d'Affaires Stefan, Chilean Chargé d'Affaires Marin, Mexican Chargé d'Affaires Panrado, Belgian Consul-General Gassim, and Brazilian Consul-General Mia Gu. Others included Li Derer, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, American Director Minsid, Commissioner of Police Bowen (Smith Deputy), Commander of the Volunteer Corps Mann, President of the American Chamber of Commerce Henderson, President of the British Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Allied Nations Association Keller. Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol, arrived by naval launch from the Luzon舰, accompanied by Commander Brock of the Luzon舰 and other naval officers, including Captain Jeff. It is also noteworthy that representatives of the Free German Movement shook hands with Howard at the wharf and solemnly told him, "Germans inside and outside Germany are now officially at war with Hitler and unanimously express their deep sympathy for the free and democratic stance taken by the United States." As soon as he finished speaking, cheers erupted. The Orphans' Home also presented the unit with a camp flag with the words "Wishing the Fourth Regiment a safe journey" written in black ink, which fluttered in the wind, increasing the sense of emotion. The chefs and waiters of the Qimei Restaurant in the Central Market at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, to thank the American soldiers for their patronage, temporarily formed a band and followed the regiment, playing music as they went, which was quite amusing.

Howard's Address: Gratitude to the Citizens

At 9:45 am, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze Patrol, delivered a farewell speech, and Colonel Howard gave an address in reply, expressing his gratitude for the cooperation and enthusiasm shown by the citizens and various countries in the past. He also commissioned Hamilton to present a silver shield from the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury as a memento. The ceremony was simple and solemn. At this time, many Shanghai ladies stepped forward to shake hands with the unit, and in small groups, farewells and best wishes could be heard everywhere. At 9:55 am, the unit, accompanied by music and applause, marched into the designated Manley & Muller small steamer. At 10:10 am, the steamer slowly set sail, with music playing loudly on board and ashore, including "God Bless America" and the song of farewell. The officers and soldiers and the well-wishers waved their hats and handkerchiefs, responding to each other. The Harrison President 轮 set sail for Manila at 1 pm.

Police Receive the Vacated Barracks

The U.S. Navy barracks, located at 243 Gordon Road, were already guarded by two Indian constables dispatched by the Gordon Road Police the day before, after the officers and soldiers of the Second Battalion withdrew the previous morning. The barracks at 196 and 155-6 Xiaoshadu Road and the barracks on Seymour Road, vacated by the First Battalion yesterday morning, were taken over by the Gordon Road Police at 6 am yesterday and guarded by Indian constables. According to sources from the Dazhong News Agency, they will not be used for other purposes for the time being. It has not yet been decided when the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will move into the premises. Yesterday afternoon, when passing by the premises, only a few workers were seen dismantling telephone lines.

U.S. Authorities Urge American Nationals to Evacuate Quickly

After the Fourth Marine Regiment of the U.S. Navy battle fleet departed in two batches, the Yangtze Patrol flagship Luzon号 and the gunboat Wake 号 (recently arrived from the upper reaches of the Yangtze) will also set sail for Manila in the coming days. The U.S. consulates in Hong Kong, Japan, and North China yesterday reiterated their call for all American nationals to evacuate immediately. There are currently 613 male and 416 female expatriates in North China and Inner Mongolia who are about to arrive in Shanghai. Due to the perilous state of Pacific shipping, it may not be possible to allocate ships to evacuate American nationals in the short term. It was confirmed here yesterday that a Jardine Matheson ship, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in December, has now been requisitioned by the Dutch East Indies government and will not sail to Shanghai. Public opinion believes that this is a sign of the Dutch determination to quickly strengthen the defense of the Dutch East Indies. It is not yet certain whether Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol, will accompany the Luzon号 and Wake 号 or remain in Shanghai. If the Luzon号 and Wake 号 sail to Manila soon, it will be their first time sailing in the open sea, as the two ships were originally shipped from the United States and assembled in Shanghai.

Wake Gunboat to Remain in Shanghai for Standby

It is generally believed that after the Luzon号 and Wake 号 leave Shanghai, the American gunboat Wake 号, which belongs to the same team, will remain in this port. The Wake entered the port yesterday afternoon to carry U.S. consular officials and American civilians who are unable to evacuate in case of emergency. Since the outbreak of the war in 1937 and the sinking of the gunboat Panay 号 in December of that year, the strength of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol has gradually declined. In 1937, the fleet consisted of six ships: Luzon 号 (flagship), Guam 号, Monocacy 号, Tutuila 号, Panay 号, and Wake 号. Later, the Panay 号 sank and the Monocacy 号 was dismantled in Shanghai, leaving four ships. Then the Wake 号 arrived, but soon the Guam 号 left again, leaving four ships until now. A notice for rent has been posted on the door of the purchasing office of the construction building at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road, also indicating that the Wake 号 and Luzon 号 will soon depart.

### Price Ceiling Set for White Coal Shipped from Vietnam to Shanghai

Yesterday, the French Municipal Council announced that the selling price of white coal shipped from Vietnam to Shanghai shall not exceed 600 yuan per ton. The French police have been ordered to pay close attention to this matter, and those who do not comply with this order will be severely punished.

### Storage of Dangerous Goods: Site Plans Required

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that, effective November 1, a new rule has been added to the licensing regulations for the storage of explosives, gunpowder, petroleum, and other dangerous materials, as follows: "The licensee shall, when deemed necessary by the Council, draw a plan of each floor of the site, indicating the approximate location and quantity of the stored materials. This plan shall be kept on the site and shall be readily available for inspection by the Council's Fire Department at any time, day or night."

### Priority Given to Industrial Organizations for Coal Usage

The Shanghai Municipal Council's plan to allocate coal to Shanghai at the official exchange rate provided by the Stabilization Fund is now underway, and there is hope that the coal situation in the city will improve. It is reported that the Council is giving priority to industrial organizations in this plan, and is currently inquiring with various factories about their monthly coal needs and studying the replies received. Once the allocation process is implemented, large quantities of coal will begin to arrive in Shanghai. According to a Council official, it has not yet been decided whether this coal will be shipped to Shanghai by commercial firms on behalf of the Council, as in the case of flour, or whether the Council will import the coal itself.

### Retailers Profiteering, Citizens Report Violations, Municipal Council to Impose Penalties in One or Two Days, Similar to French Concession

A spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that the Council will take action to penalize retailers who sell goods above the price ceiling within one or two days. Since the announcement was issued, the Council has received letters from citizens reporting retailers profiteering. Those who report violations to the Council should attach the receipt and the name of the reporter as evidence.

Seventy-Seven Cases Penalized

Tan Gutii, Chairman of the French Concession Municipal Council, stated that in the two weeks from November 1 to 15, the French police, under strict orders, arrested a total of 770 merchants who disregarded official orders and sought only to profiteer. Among these cases, 38 were for retailers failing to display a complete list of price-controlled goods, 24 were for selling goods above the price ceiling, 12 were for selling goods underweight, 2 were for selling rice to individuals exceeding the limit, and 1 was for hoarding flour. All were penalized.

Efforts to Expand Price Controls

The French authorities are fully cooperating with the Shanghai Municipal Council to shoulder the responsibility of eliminating hoarding and profiteering. However, formal actions that are currently under consideration cannot be disclosed in detail, as cracking down on hoarding and profiteering requires lightning speed and surprise. Tan also stated that the French authorities and the Council are in constant contact to jointly expand the scope of the control plan. Relevant officials are constantly studying market conditions to include more items in the price control list to be issued at any time. It is reported that some hoarders have hoarded goods and are unwilling to sell them at the price ceiling to avoid losses, and are still storing them in warehouses. However, these goods cannot be stored for a long time, so some have begun to rot. Tan concluded by noting the importance of the Council's price control task, stating that it is illegal for users to purchase goods at the price ceiling that is more than what they need and resell the excess portion at a high price.

Three Catering Establishments Closed for Eight Days

The French police recently discovered that three catering establishments, Jiang Mingxuan at 153 i on rue Sainte-Marie, Ling Buyun at 153 D on the same street, and G. Skepichenko at 235 on the same street, were charging more than the price ceiling for certain foods (selling at 4 yuan or 4.2 yuan for items with a price ceiling of 2.4 yuan) in violation of the French Consulate's order of November 16, 1941. These offending shops have been closed for eight days, and their business licenses have been confiscated during this period.

### Council Rice Arrives

Large quantities of Council foreign rice have arrived. Yesterday, the Taikoo Shipping Company's Hanyang轮 arrived from Hong Kong with 10,200 bags, and the Anhui 轮 also arrived from Hong Kong on the same day with 5,100 bags, for a total of 15,300 bags. The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that, effective December 2 (Tuesday), no transportation permits will be issued to those who have not registered rice or flour with the Council.

### Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Encourages Police to Work Harder, Special Inspection Held After US Troops Depart, Increased Responsibilities

Li Derer, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Fei Pu, Director-General, inspected the Shanghai Municipal Police at the Shanghai Volunteer Corps parade ground yesterday afternoon, under the command of Acting Commissioner of Police Smith. Medals were awarded to 54 police officers for their meritorious service and 94 officers for their longest service. In his address, Li stated that, with the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment now withdrawn from Shanghai, the responsibility of protecting the lives and property of the citizens has increased, and everyone must work harder to live up to expectations. At that time, a Chinese woman, whose husband had died in the line of duty, requested an award from Li, and Li also awarded her a First Class Special Service Medal.

### The Grandeur of the US Military's Departure from Shanghai Yesterday Morning

The Second Battalion of the US military departed the previous day, and the First Battalion boarded ships early yesterday morning. On Nanjing Road, citizens bid farewell, creating an unprecedented scene. The left picture (top) shows the Qimei Bar band playing music to bid farewell, and (bottom) shows the procession arriving at the New Customs Wharf (Dahua Photo).

### Shanghai Municipal Council Publishes Statistics on Family Accounting, About 80% of Over One Thousand Account Books Issued Last Month Were Eligible for Selection

The Industrial and Social Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently published the following statistics on the accounting of Chinese staff families: In October, 1,020 account books were issued, and 881 families kept records. 139 families either applied to stop keeping records or failed to keep records. After reviewing the account books, nearly 80% of them were eligible for selection, and over 65% had excellent results. The December account books were sent out on November 24. The families that received the October account books are requested to pay attention to the following points: All items such as salary, various subsidies, and income tax should be listed separately. Pay attention to omissions in the expenditure section. Those who have not filled in the housing form (Form 2) must fill in the dimensions, number of windows, and other items. As of the end of the accounting period on December 31, all purchased but unused items should be entered in Form 4. Each monthly account book should be handed over to the staff in the nearby post office counter on the first day of the following month to avoid errors. The strong cooperation of various families in this accounting effort has made a great contribution to the general public. With only one month left until the end, it is hoped that you will remain consistent and strive to complete it.

### Savings from Birthday Noodles Used to Support Student Aid, Retired Elder Benefits the Needy

Our newspaper's Student Aid Fund received 200 yuan from Retired Elder, savings from birthday noodles, in a gesture that is deeply appreciated. On the Elder's 60th birthday, he lamented the country's tribulations and the people's hardships, and declined birthday celebrations from relatives and friends. He donated the savings from the noodles to the Student Aid Fund. It is hoped that elders from all walks of life will emulate the Elder's initiative and benefit needy students. At the same time, Mr. Shao Shanshi donated 50 yuan to the Student Aid Fund on his 30th birthday. His benevolence is admirable and worthy of emulation. The list of donors yesterday is as follows:

Total Donations Exceed 40,000

Retired Elder 200 yuan, members of the Tongmao Yarn Company 100 yuan, Mr. Wang Jiantang 100 yuan, Mr. Shao Shanshi, well-wishers from No. 10 Qian Shan Li on his birthday, 50 yuan, anonymous (receipt number 950) 50 yuan, Mr. Ying Yongyu, Mr. Shen Zhaopeng (donated 4 yuan each as a funeral gift for Mr. Sheng Mujie's father and designated for our newspaper's Student Aid Fund), totaling 508 yuan.

Previously, the balance was 39,922 yuan and 82 cents, for a total of 40,430 yuan and 82 cents.

Correction: The 100 yuan donated by Mr. Ye Qiyu, which was published yesterday, was a gift for Sir Ho Tung's diamond wedding anniversary and designated for our newspaper's Student Aid Fund. This should be corrected.

### Five Robbers Arrested

At 6:20 pm yesterday, five robbers suddenly broke into No. 13, Lane 36, North Henan Road. Two robbers brandished guns and threatened to rob. The victim shouted for help, and the robbers, realizing that the situation was not good, did not steal anything and tried to escape. However, the police had received a report and dispatched a large number of detectives to arrest them. The five robbers were arrested on the spot, and five guns and more than ten bullets were seized. They were all taken to the police station for investigation. At the time, the police fired one shot, but no one was injured.

It is reported that the women's group's handicraft class, led by Mrs. Guo Shun and Mrs. Rong Qizhao, has been producing excellent items for many years.

### Collecting Discarded Tickets to Help Ticket Sellers Skim Profits: Dismissed Ticket Seller Arrested and Detained

The evil habit of ticket sellers of the British-owned tram company in the Public Concession skimming profits has persisted for a long time. Although the company authorities have tried to prevent it, it has been difficult to achieve results due to the tricks and methods used by the ticket sellers. The methods used by the ticket sellers include colluding with dismissed ticket sellers and deploying them at different stations. If there are ticket inspectors at the front station, they will

Rush to Communicate

before the tram reaches the station, so that the ticket seller is alerted and has already distributed the tickets to the passengers before arriving at the station. They also collude with the tram drivers. If they see ticket inspectors at the front station, they will suddenly stop the tram several times as a signal, and then reduce the speed so that the ticket seller can calmly issue tickets to the passengers. Therefore, although the company has increased ticket inspections, it has not been effective. The company has already found out about the communication methods, but because it has not been able to obtain concrete evidence, it is

Difficult to Crack Down

They have only notified the ticket inspectors to adopt a surveillance policy on the actions of dismissed ticket sellers. At 10:30 pm yesterday, a Western ticket inspector discovered Wang A'si, a dismissed ticket seller from Haimen, wandering around the trolley bus station on Yuqiaqing Road near the New World. He was chased away, but Wang suddenly threw a paper bag to the ground as he fled. The ticket inspector apprehended Wang and opened the paper bag, which contained about 200 discarded tram tickets that had been thrown away by passengers. He was handed over to the police and taken to the Old Gate police station. Under investigation, Wang confessed that the discarded tickets were collected and resold to ticket sellers on the tram for mixed use, and he could earn about two yuan a day. He was detained and sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him for fraud. After questioning by Judge Zhan Liangce, he was ordered to be detained for further investigation.

As a result, the buildings, machinery, and property of the China Canvas Weaving Factory, Yifeng Textile Factory, and Shuntong Foundry were all destroyed by fire.

### Counterfeit Money Traffickers Arrested: Headquarters Located in Zhabei

Two customers came to a cigarette and paper shop on Rue du Père Huc in the French Concession at about 4 pm the day before yesterday, carrying five yuan in counterfeit banknotes from the Bank of China and trying to use them. The shop discovered the counterfeit money and summoned the police, who arrested the two customers and took them to the police station. They confessed that the counterfeit money gang was run by Yang Gengsheng (34 years old, from Jiangbei), and that their headquarters was located at a certain address in the North China Apartments at the intersection of Rue du Père Huc and Avenue Lafayette. The detectives immediately went to the address and arrested Yang Gengsheng on the spot. They seized 5,000 yuan in counterfeit banknotes from the Bank of China, in five-yuan and ten-yuan denominations. After strict interrogation, they also confessed that the sales headquarters was located at No. 68 Rue Galle, run by Ma A'mei, and that there was a large-scale counterfeit money manufacturing factory located in Zhabei, run by Tang Jinyuan and Shandong Laohei. However, Ma received wind of the arrest and quickly fled. At the same time, after arresting Yang Gengsheng, the French police continued to watch the room and arrested Wang Liansheng, a member of Yang's gang. They seized 1,000 yuan in counterfeit Bank of China banknotes on his person and took him to the police station for further investigation.

### Guard Post Overreach: Teasing a Woman Leads to Trouble; Rifle Discharges, Injuring Woman's Arm

A local woman, Zhang Linmei, 19 years old, residing at No. 77, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, along the street, has been working as a factory worker at Jinrong Wood Factory at the intersection of Beiler Road and Father Du Road. Yesterday afternoon, after finishing work, Zhang Linmei returned home. After dinner, around 8:30 PM, Linmei was doing laundry in the main room downstairs. At that time, the main door of her residence was not closed. A Vietnamese constable (No. 422) passed by the door and, seeing Linmei alone inside, stood outside the door and began teasing her. However, Linmei ignored him. The constable continued to make wanton jokes repeatedly. Linmei, unable to bear it any longer, began to close the main door. The Vietnamese constable became enraged out of humiliation and raised the rifle he was carrying to knock on the door. Somehow, it suddenly discharged. With a shattering sound, the bullet flew out, piercing a hole in the door and entering the main room, severely injuring Zhang Linmei's left arm. Her family reported to the police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. Simultaneously, a car was called to send Zhang Linmei to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

### Mr. Li Shao and Wife's Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting

— Shi Chong

Mr. Li Yongsen of Yushan, along with his wife, Ms. Shao Jingyun, held an exhibition of Chinese and Western arts at the Daxin Exhibition Hall for seven days. Yesterday was the first day of the opening, and despite the drizzling rain, visitors flocked to the exhibition. It was a display of elegant arts, a perfect combination, and a delightful story in the art world, not to be outdone by the exclusive beauty of Zhao and Guan. Mr. Li's Western paintings, mostly watercolors, have a faithful style and possess a lively and transformative spirit. The colors are bright and pleasing to the eye, setting them apart from the heavy, turbid, and crude works of today, as different as being on the floor and on the bed. Among the landscapes, "Zhaofeng Park," "Hou Alley," and "Slum Alley" are the best. Among the still lifes, "Dahlia" and "Peony" are the best. Among the figures, "Girl" and "Leisure" are the best. The meticulous composition, fluent brushwork, and harmonious tones all reach a mature and refined level. Ms. Shao's works, inspired by the Song and Yuan dynasties, exhibit both classical refinement and individuality. The two pieces, "Joy Overflowing the Eyebrows" after Bian Luan and "Reeds and Geese" after Li Di, are exquisite and possess a rich charm. The four pieces of silk bands depict white plum blossoms, red bamboo, crimson maple leaves, and camellias as background, respectively. The colors are beautiful, the brushwork is vigorous, and there is no trace of the delicate, feminine air. Other pieces, such as "Okra," "Hyacinth Bean Flowers," and "Lotus," are fresh and elegant, all excellent compositions. The two landscapes, imitating Xia Gui and Ma Yuan, have such vigorous brushwork that it is hard to believe they are the work of a woman. This is truly admirable. I believe that Chinese painting reached its peak in the Jin and Tang dynasties, ascended to its summit in the Five Dynasties, and flourished in the two Song dynasties. The style was rigorous, the skill was exquisite, and the masters were truly worthy of reverence. From the Yuan and Ming dynasties, it was still possible to inherit the ancient constitution. After the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, various schools emerged, with the exception of the Dongshan landscapes and the Kunling flower-and-bird paintings. Countless schools arose for a time in one place or another. In recent painting styles, there is a general tendency towards innovation and novelty, and many unorthodox paths have emerged, making it impossible to rectify the situation. Now, observing Ms. Shao's works, which adhere to strict orthodoxy and revive the traditional style, it is almost like hearing a welcome sound in a desolate valley.

### Spot Yarn Eagerly Seeks to Unload, but Few Receive Deliveries

The yarn market, which rose in the afternoon of the previous day, declined again yesterday. This is because spot yarn transactions have been cut off, and prices are falling steadily, with a lack of buyers. As the end of the year approaches in an instant, the financial situation is becoming increasingly tight, so some floating goods are eager to unload and seek cash. As a result, they have to change their strategy and sell on the exchange market, so the chips are becoming more loose. However, under this environment, the bulls are still fighting. However, there are very few buyers, so there is no other way than to post heavy discounts. The discounts posted by various parties today are even higher than the previous day. The highest price for 20-count variable horse yarn was 2,520 yuan, and the low price was 2,406 yuan.

The exchange market opened in the morning with the remaining momentum from the previous day, with the opening price at 2,520 yuan. Shortly thereafter, it fell straight to 2,475 yuan. However, the bulls still did not let up and rose again to 2,500 yuan. Unexpectedly, gold then fell, and spot yarn was sold at a discount, but there were no buyers. In addition, Japanese yarn and thread fell across the board. At the same time, large bull speculators spit out their positions, and the market gradually fell to 2,410 yuan. The closing price was 2,415 yuan. It has been observed that the total volume of transactions in half a day was approximately 1,850 bales. In the afternoon, the market was extremely depressed and entered a state of stagnation. The opening price was 2,410 yuan, falling to 2,400 yuan, and the closing price was 2,406 yuan. Futures delivery was suspended.

Spot cotton transactions were quiet, and prices fell by 30-40 yuan, but there were few buyers. The power of the past has now been diminished.

### Cash Plunge Comes Terribly: Returns to the 14,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the cash market plunged again in the grey market, and prices have retreated into the 14,000 yuan range. This is because foreign news widely reported that the new negotiations between the US and Japan were still difficult to approach, and the tension in Vietnam and Thailand made the parties look again towards decline. Although the overall transaction volume of the day was auspicious, with Xianghe buying 520 taels, Tianyuan buying 310 taels, and Yongcheng, Shengji, Shihe, exchange dealers, and securities firms each buying 200-some taels, Mingfeng alone sold 820 taels, Tongkangyong sold 400-some taels, and Xiangxingyong and Decheng each sold 330-350 taels. The selling pressure was strong, causing the price to rise at one point to 14,800 yuan, but it immediately fell. Before the evening close, it reached a low price of 13,470 yuan, and finally rebounded by a small 950 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 17,560 taels. Ornaments rebounded by a small 70 yuan, and silver was average.

Cash Falls Nearly 1,000

From the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 14,600 yuan at 9:00, which was 150 yuan higher. Xianghe, Xiangyu, Yong, Hesheng, and Tianlu helped to sell, and the price immediately fell by 400 yuan, sharply declining to 14,200 yuan. Suddenly, securities firms, exchange dealers, Chengji, and Tianyuan came with force to buy, and the price immediately rose by 600 yuan, rising to 14,800 yuan. Negative rumors arose again, and sellers gathered. Xiangyu, Yong, Mingfeng, and Gonghe came with force to sell, and many short positions were quickly cut, and the price collapsed by 1,300 yuan, falling to 13,500 yuan. Xianghe, Shihe, Tianyuan, and Yongcheng bought in at noon, raising the price to 13,900 yuan. Xiangxingyong sold again, and the price fell again, closing at 13,650 yuan at noon. The price opened at 13,600 yuan at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, which was 50 yuan lower. Xiangxingyong covered short positions, and Xianghe and Chengji competed to buy, raising the price by 150 yuan, rising to 13,750 yuan. Mingfeng, Shunyuan, and securities firms sold with force, and the price fell again, retreating to 13,470 yuan. The price closed at 13,500 yuan at 4:00 PM, a further decrease of 950 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a high-low of 1,330 yuan on the day. The retail price of gold from the cash shop was 13,700 yuan, and the buying price was 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.

Ornaments Follow Suit

The selling price of silver ornaments per tael in pawnshops, Datonghang and Xintonghang, both rose to 1,500 yuan in the morning, then rose another 100 yuan. From noon, the price was listed at 1,400 yuan, and the buying price was reduced by 150 yuan, rebounding by a small 70 yuan. Silver was still listed at 22 yuan, and the black market was 16 yuan.

### Black Market Exchange Buyers Wait and See; A Japanese Military Ticket Market is Established

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: the central bank and exchange banks both had flat exchange rates, and the exchange rates of small banks also did not fluctuate. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies first tightened and then tended to flatten. The US dollar was at 3.75 yuan, and it was once difficult to obtain a settlement for a certain import foreign firm. However, a certain Chinese speculator sold 1,000 US dollars, and there was a continued supply. Buyers waited and watched, and the trend appeared to stabilize. The afternoon was even more dull and flat, and no further transactions were concluded. At the 4:00 PM closing, the US exchange rate was 2.4375, and the US dollar was 3.75 yuan, which was the same as the closing rate on the previous day.

Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions: British and American gold pounds fell by 20 yuan along with the cash price. British gold tickets, however, rose by one yuan. US gold tickets retreated to 27 yuan and 20 cents, falling by 1.6 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong tickets rose by one cent. The trend of Japanese gold tickets was stable, and the market price was flat. Korean tickets, however, tended to fall, and the evening market retreated to 2.6 yuan. The trend of military tickets was bullish, and the evening market rose to 3.27 yuan. It is rumored that a military ticket market will be established on the first of next month, and the address will be the former site of the American ticket market.

### Coarse White Rice First Strong, Then Weak

Yesterday's Public Association Price Setting: It was seen rising at first, but ultimately, due to the lack of trading, it gradually fell back. For example, the spot price of 24 coarse white rice for the current month opened at 210 yuan, then fell to 203 yuan, and then to 202 yuan in the afternoon. The closing price was 200 yuan, a small decrease of 4.5 yuan compared to the previous market. For October, the morning price was 206 yuan to 202 yuan, and then 198 yuan in the afternoon, a small decrease of 6.5 yuan. For September, the morning price was 205 yuan to 200 yuan, and then it closed at 195 yuan in the afternoon, falling by 9 yuan. The futures price for November 30 opened at 199 yuan in the morning and closed at 197 yuan. The off-market price was 192.5 yuan, and then 193 yuan to 193.5 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 95 yuan, a small decrease of only 5 cents. For December 10, the morning price was 208 yuan to 4.5 yuan, and the closing price was 199.5 yuan. The afternoon opened at 198 yuan to 200 yuan and 5 cents, and the closing price was 201 yuan, a small decrease of 5 yuan. Hong Kong coarse rice was 178 yuan in the morning and 175 yuan in the afternoon, a small decrease of one yuan. Taikoo White B Mark was 195 yuan, and Dutch Red was 173 yuan to 69.5 yuan in the morning, and 72 yuan to 65 yuan in the afternoon. The closing price was 67 yuan, resulting in a small decrease of 3 yuan. The total volume of transactions for the day was over 4,000 bags of spot goods and over 8,000 bags of futures.

Sugar continued to arrive in port. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. In addition to transporting the Public Works Department's foreign rice, it also brought 6,000 bags of sugar, which were unloaded at the company's dock in the French Concession.

### Domestic Debt Short Positions Feel Impatient; Large Speculators Remain Unmoved; Weak Foreign Stocks Cause Environment

The over-the-counter market for public bonds was weak yesterday, and sentiment was depressed. Selling pressure was strong in the trading floor, mainly because people were still waiting for the official disclosure of the US-Japan negotiations. Large speculators remained unmoved, and general short positions gradually became impatient and left the market, resulting in a continued decline. However, Type E was relatively firm, because it was about to be drawn, and there were more short positions to cover. Type D required 60,000-70,000 units, and there were very few sellers, so they had to raise prices to buy in. Yesterday morning's market price hovered within 9 yuan. It once broke through 9 yuan before noon, but still retreated. Buyers were mostly Jiufeng and Hongda, and sellers were mostly Tongsheng, Runde, Dazhong, Xiexing, and Yuan. In the afternoon, Xiexing continued to sell, and Tongkang and Houda also came out. Jiufeng continued to buy, and Zhongfu slightly covered back. The trend continued to weaken. As a result, except for Types D and E, which were slightly better by 2 to 4 cents, the rest continued to decrease by 3 to 8 cents. The total transaction volume was approximately 2.12 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory's new stock were traded at 10 yuan.

The Public Industry Exchange Stock Market: The decline was very strong, forced by the environment. The US-Japan negotiations may have collapsed, and the selling pressure was very strong. Although there was some low-level short covering later, the rebound was small, and the decline was still quite large. There was no market in the afternoon.

The British company Zheng Guanghe Limited will pay an interim dividend of 3 yuan per share of national currency on its 140,000 ordinary shares for the year 1941 on December 12.

### After All, Price Limits Can Be Effective: Japonica Rice is Sold as Soon as it Arrives; Flour Market Briefly Pauses: 15,000 Bags of Rice Arrive

Yesterday, foreign rice was still at a standstill, while new northern and southern japonica rice and jian yuan rice arrived by land and water, totaling more than 200 bags. The actual demand from local food stores and shops also increased slightly. In addition to direct distribution by trading companies, there were also 100-some bags of northern and southern japonica rice and 30-40 bags of shady yuan and a dozen bags of du jian rice on the market. However, the owners, afraid of the 150 yuan price limit, were willing to sell as soon as the rice arrived and did not dare to adhere to the asking price. As a result, the selling prices of each grade fell by 3-4 yuan again. Northern Kunshan new japonica rice was 186 yuan, 183-4 yuan, and then 176 yuan. Bo Dao was 173 yuan to 170 yuan. New high shady yuan was 185-6 yuan, and original duzi jian was 170 yuan. Although the selling prices were similar to the previous market, the quality has gradually declined.

The flour market was in a soft state. As for wheat, small factories bought several hundred bags of Jiangbei wheat on the market at 73 yuan. The Dayuehua factory, however, was reluctant to inquire at the original price, as the flour market was falling.

The Public Works Department's foreign rice also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang Wheel arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying 10,200 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the company's dock in the French Concession. In addition, the Anhui Wheel also arrived in Shanghai in the morning, also carrying 5,100 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The ship is currently berthed at the company's pontoon, and will be unloaded at the dock in the coming days. (Ancestor)

### Soybeans Rise Again

Yesterday's miscellaneous grains market: there was no trading in the afternoon due to a misunderstanding regarding the entry permits, so there was only half a day of trading in the morning. The price of cooking oil rose by 6-7 yuan to more than 10 yuan due to the rise in Japanese military tickets, and sentiment was bullish. Yellow soybeans also rose slightly, and corn rose by 1-2 yuan. A total of 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 60 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 600 dan of Dayou factory clear oil, 30 dan of Lide factory vegetable oil, 300 bags of Tianjin Xin Jinyuan, 200 bags of green soybeans, and 700 bags of spot corn were sold. There were also more than 200 tons of futures.

400 bags of soybeans were exported to Singapore on the 29th, and 1,410 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Japanese-Owned Tea Factory: All Tea Sold to Chinese Merchants - Feeling Despair About Foreign Trade

Due to the urgent crisis in the Pacific, the lack of shipping, and the halt in foreign trade, the foreign companies' black and green tea trade has been limited to inter-company transactions, with no direct foreign trade. The black and green rough tea stored in the Japanese-owned tea factories has been sold to Chinese merchants, as the Japanese merchants feel despair about foreign exports. The market was only for store tea yesterday. Merchants from Tianjin bought 120 dan of Longjing baking green tea, with Longjing selling for 730 yuan and baking green selling for 350 yuan. There were no other transactions. On the 29th, 175 boxes of tea leaves were shipped to Hong Kong, 107 boxes were shipped to Singapore, and 33 boxes of silk were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Cloth Market Sluggish

Factory-made cloth initially mirrored the upward momentum of the previous day, with opening prices uniformly rising. However, due to weak actual demand, the trend reversed, turning sluggish. "Double Elephant" coarse cloth opened at 94.25 yuan, a 1 yuan increase from the previous day, but the market faltered, dropping to 92 yuan. Other types followed a similar pattern of rising initially and then falling. As a result, white cloth prices fell by 0.5 to 1.5 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. Customer sales were stagnant, with very few transactions in the local market, totaling just over 200 pieces, mostly flannel and coarse cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, the market lacked the strength to rise. Prices for all types of cloth uniformly declined. Futures trading on the exchange was inactive due to a lack of settlements, and the spot market was also unusually quiet. "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at 89 yuan but steadily declined to 86.5 yuan by noon. The market then stabilized with no major fluctuations, closing at 87.5 yuan, a decrease of 3.5 yuan. "Jiao Junzi" (a type of cloth) serge started at 3.3112 yuan and fell to 3.2 yuan. Market sentiment was weak, primarily due to sluggish actual sales.

### Overcoat Fabric囤戶神氣

Due to the cold weather, actual sales of overcoat fabrics have increased, and those hoarding inventory are demanding high prices, showing no intention of selling. However, those who need the fabric have no choice but to negotiate with them to make a deal. Yesterday, top-tier fabrics such as "Kaysman," "Head" cloth, "Kao Hua," and herringbone patterns were mostly priced around 400 yuan per yard. "Pearl Head" and "Silver Gun" fabrics were generally priced around 300 yuan. Plain-colored overcoat fabrics were priced at 160 yuan for "Asia-Pacific," 120 yuan for "Mei Feng," and 100 yuan for "Rong Tai." Pure wool Polish overcoat fabric was priced at 130-140 yuan.

### Willow Stripe Suan Wei Fabric Sells Widely

Sales of gray plain Suan Wei fabric have slowed somewhat due to the weather, but wholesale and囤積transactions remain numerous. Black and dark blue colors are selling briskly. Wide and narrow, thick and thin willow stripe Suan Wei fabrics are especially popular, with high demand from Western tailors. Top-tier Western fabrics are selling for 150-160 yuan per yard, second-tier for 110-120 yuan. Top-tier Eastern fabrics are selling for 100 yuan, second-tier for 70-80 yuan. Top-tier fabrics from local factories are selling for 85-86 yuan, second-tier for around 70 yuan.

### Cutch Extremely Expensive

Recently, due to a prolonged lack of new arrivals, the market supply of cutch is exceptionally tight. Prices have been as high as 450 yuan per package, but the trend remains firm. Recently, the market price has been called at 500 yuan, another increase of 50 yuan, and remains robust.

### Metal Market Remains Firm and Stable

Metal trading has been affected by firm and high purchase prices, making it difficult to expand sales channels. Both local and foreign business is scarce. Traders are reluctant to lower prices due to limited inventory and weak bottom lines. As a result, actual sales are sluggish.

### Overseas Chinese Peddlers in the Dutch East Indies

— Wu Jian San

In the villages of the Dutch East Indies, one often sees Chinese people pushing a cart full of miscellaneous goods, their faces covered in sweat, hawking their wares in all directions. The Malays call them "Kolontong" or "Tjina Mindering" – these are the so-called "Overseas Chinese Peddlers."

These overseas Chinese peddlers mostly hawk sarongs, embroidery, antiques, leather goods, threads, and various food items at bargain prices. They load their merchandise onto a wheeled cart and push it from village to village. This is very convenient for Malay housewives who live far from the market and are unable to leave their homes. No wonder that when the overseas Chinese peddlers arrive, they are greeted with the same excitement as if meeting a lover, enthusiastically waving from afar and shouting loudly:

"Baba (Note 1)! Mali sini (Note 2) ya!"

Even when paying in cash, the prices are much higher than in the market; and if buying on credit, the interest rates are frighteningly high (four cents per guilder per day, which amounts to 14.4 guilders per year). But they often just grab at the air.” Therefore, these overseas Chinese peddlers make considerable profits; for example, if they sell goods worth 1,800 guilders at cost price in a year, they can earn 6,000-7,000 guilders including profits and interest on credit. Most of them also run "small money houses" to provide loans to the locals, with interest rates of two cents per guilder per day, which amounts to six cents per month. Because they are willing to work hard and endure hardship, and are also "good at making money," they live a decent life overseas; at least much happier than the "Qingtian peddlers" who roam around Europe.

However, this type of peddling is also difficult. The locals often refuse to pay their debts, and if pressed for payment, they resort to violence. As a result, although they can earn 4,000-5,000 guilders a year, they often have 2,000-3,000 guilders of debt that they can't collect. And because these are remote and lawless areas, thieves often commit robberies; overseas Chinese peddlers often encounter such disasters, losing all their belongings and becoming penniless. They are even sometimes stabbed or shot to death.

These peddlers are mostly from the Min and Yue regions. There are also some Shandong people who sell "Shandong silk" and other fabrics, and some Shaoxing people who sell so-called "Shanghai sundries." Because the Dutch East Indies' entry tax (150 guilders per person upon arrival) is forfeited after six months, they usually sell in the Dutch East Indies for four or five months before going to British territory for a while and then returning. For the sake of food and clothing, they travel the world like migrant birds; coming in the spring and leaving in the autumn. Every time I see their faces, tanned black by the tropical sun, and hear their heavy breathing like oxen, I can't help but think of an old poem:

"To steal a living in this world is also bitter and hard!"

(Note 1) Malays call people "Baba," which means "elder brother."

(Note 2) Malay: "Mali" means "come," "sini" means "here."

Science

### Scientists Who Risk Their Lives

— Shen Xiong

Even today, many people still think that scientists are people who spend their lives in laboratories, constantly analyzing substances in test tubes and creating foul-smelling chemical mixtures. But modern scientists are not like that. They also risk their lives, just like soldiers on the front lines.

Take Professor Paul Flory, a toxicology expert, for example. In a poisoning case, he suspected cheese, but after repeated chemical tests, he couldn't prove that the cheese was poisonous. So he started eating various kinds of cheese himself. As a result, he finally ate a poisonous cheese. Naturally, he became very ill, but he didn't care because he had already proven his case.

Not only tasting poison, but there are also people who let a kind of African tsetse fly bite themselves. This tsetse fly transmits a terrible sleeping sickness. Sufferers have headaches, are sleepy, look haggard, and eventually die. This was done by a doctor in Africa, his assistant, and a native. None of them had sleeping sickness, so the doctor first injected a guinea pig vaccine and then let the tsetse fly bite himself. Because he wanted to test the effectiveness of his new treatment, a drug called Germanin. Fortunately, his drug was very effective, and he recovered. But what a great risk he took!

Have you ever wondered if a person who freezes to death in a blizzard suffers? There is someone who can answer that question, who can tell you what it feels like to freeze to death in extreme cold. He is Sir Frederick Banting, a scientist at Cambridge. In the specially prepared cold room of his laboratory, he conducted a self-freezing experiment.

At first, he felt very painful. But at a certain moment, the feeling of cold disappeared, followed by a lovely warm feeling. He was not exposed to sunlight, he was exposed to cold. His nerve center had stopped fighting, his blood had returned to his skin, ... his temperature had dropped rapidly, and he was already hovering on the edge of death. What a heroic experiment!

Some geologists, in order to study volcanoes, even risked going deep into the crater to observe them. The volcanoes they observed were active volcanoes, with the constant danger of death. But for the sake of science, they disregarded life and death.

Inventions

### Flight Training Vehicle

— Zhang Qiao

Thousands of aviation trainees in the United States Air Force can now practice flying on land during flight testing without having to soar into the clouds. This land-based flight vehicle was invented at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and is now being tested at Buck Field. The seat, control stick, rudder pedals, and other components in the vehicle are similar to those in an aircraft. There is a .22 caliber gun in the front. The seat in the vehicle is suspended, so its tilting, upward and downward movement is completely similar to that of an aircraft in flight. Therefore, the same training effect can be obtained in the land-based flight training vehicle.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fifteen Dad, go out and sing!

This person really had a quick and impatient temper. As soon as he said this, he immediately stood up, holding the cup of tea that Mei Bao handed him, and immediately unwrapped the package of wound medicine, intending to personally pour it down Qiu Haitang's throat. Fortunately, Mei Shi was quick and agile, and quickly stepped forward to take it, while smiling apologetically:

"Is it wound medicine? Mr. Zhang, taking wound medicine requires wine, otherwise, I'm afraid it won't be effective, right?"

"Ah! That's right, I'm confused!" Zhang Yincai's half-statue-like body then retracted back. "Then wait a moment and let this young lady serve you to take it!"

With this, Qiu Haitang's heart calmed down a little.

"Old Wu, I have twenty yuan here, it's nothing, just take it as money for you to buy some food, so that your body can recover easily!" As he said this, he stuffed four very old banknotes into the corner of Qiu Haitang's pillow.

"Ah! Boss Zhang, — can't let you… spend money……".

"What's 'can't'? No matter how unreasonable I, Zhang, am, I will never ask you to return half a cent in the future, so feel free to accept it!" He casually picked up the cup of tea and took a big gulp, then stood up from the square stool, making as if to leave immediately.

"Mei Shi, quickly kowtow… to Boss… Zhang…!" Qiu Haitang tried her best to raise her voice.

Mei Bao bowed deeply to Zhang Yincai and thanked him sincerely a few times. (275)

### Queen's Theatre to Be Completed Soon Decides to Cooperate with MGM Officially Opens Around Christmas

Today there is news that should be reported to millions of movie fans, that is, the magnificent Queen's Theatre has been completed and is about to open. The Queen's Theatre is located at the intersection of Chaqing Road and Sanma Road, next to Yipinxiang, facing the racecourse, with the most convenient transportation. At the corner, light stands are installed, and in the evening, if you look from the International Hotel, the light will be so bright that the racecourse will be illuminated as if it were daytime.

It is said that the Queen's started construction last year. After construction began, it was first noticed by Western film companies, and behind the scenes, they competed to cooperate with the theatre. Therefore, the theatre authorities decided to increase investment in construction, striving to give the people of Shanghai a completely new feeling at the time of the opening. In two years. The capital was increased from 1.5 million yuan to 4 million yuan.

According to the person in charge of the theatre yesterday, the theatre has decided to show first-run Western films and has decided on new MGM authoritative films. As for the opening film and whether there is a contract with other Western film companies, it is not yet time to announce. Before the opening of the Majestic Theatre, it was rumored that the theatre would show MGM productions, but this news was later proven to be inaccurate. Unexpectedly, MGM films belong to the Queen's. It is said that the Queen's and Dahua's have decided to cooperate with MGM, and it is obvious that the Queen's has other companies' blockbuster films in addition to MGM.

Latest news. The Queen's Theatre has decided to open around Christmas.

### I Secretly Tell You Some Movie-Making Magic (Part 2)

— Qian Ben

When a gang of thieves robs someone and gags them, the actor playing the victim doesn't have to suffer in agony. On the contrary, he has something good to eat. I'm not kidding you, these things are all made of gummy candy. Candy is used to make many strange things on the screen. Whenever an actor bites a book or a ball, it's made of candy! Animals are especially fond of candy, so if you see dogs, cats, monkeys, or bears biting curtains, belts, shoelaces, and other things, you can be sure they're biting things made of candy!

Jam and chocolate are often used as blood flowing from wounds, and pickled pork is used to replace human flesh. When someone is to be branded with fire on the screen, a piece of pickled pork is placed on asbestos, and the asbestos is attached to the flesh. In this way, the red-hot iron can really brand the "flesh", resulting in a squeaking sound that is extremely realistic, but in fact, the person's flesh is not damaged at all. Only the pickled pork is branded.

The funniest thing is the substitutes for food. The most obvious example is ice cream, because ice cream melts quickly under the heat of the photographic lights, so potato flour is used instead. These secrets are not noticeable at all on the screen, but once they are revealed, they are not so rare.

### After Seeing "Professional Woman"

— Yang Jun

After watching the "Professional Woman" performed by Zhonglv at Tiangong, I feel that it can truly reflect the inner pain of professional women in today's society. I think this play will definitely give the audience a great inspiration. At present, general professional women are struggling with the corrupt forces of society. In order to fight for the independent, free, and equal status of women, they are willing to sacrifice their own happiness and prepare to open up a bright path for future female compatriots. We can see their hard work from this play, and Zhang Fenglai is one of the representatives. She has suffered all kinds of bullying from Fang Weide, the director of the unified tax bureau. He tried every means to achieve his goal of pursuing her, but she resolutely rejected him. With a strong will and correct belief, she stood on her own position and worked hard for the oppressed professional women.

Other characters in the play can portray special personalities. The story is well-interwoven, and the performance skills are needless to say. From the beginning to the end, it can tightly grab the audience's hearts and control the audience's emotions. The whole play can be said to be impeccable. Zheng Naili, who plays the flower girl, is innocent and lively. Zhao Nu is the director of Zhonglv. He plays Wang Daoben, with a serious attitude and humor, which is very appropriate for his identity. Shao Hua, who plays Zhang Jinzhong, can also be said to have reached a mature level. He can also show his personality from small movements. Wu Chunzhen's Mrs. Fang reveals a brave woman and is quite commendable. Liao Fan's Director Fang's performance is quite moving. His stubborn thinking and the預of his behavior are performed fluently. He issued an order that all married women should be suspended from employment. Many female employees in the bureau lost their jobs. Zhang Fenglai concealed the fact that she was married and was able to keep her position. She is young and beautiful and is favored by the director. In order to maintain his hypocritical mask of a gentleman and moralist, the director also prohibits his daughter's free love. On the other hand, he shamelessly does many despicable deeds. All kinds of ugly acts are finally revealed. Later, he even used public funds to do speculative business, and the truth was discovered by Li Zhuan. The hypocrite who claims to maintain benevolence, justice, and morality, at this time, is bound to suffer the責of conscience. This活地 depicts the treacherousness and shamelessness of目投機shang. This is not a play, this is simply a縮影of the ugly society.

Miss Liang Liqian, a famous Peking opera amateur from Fudan University (see the picture above), is a famous荀派花旦amateur. She has a charming appearance, a natural golden voice, and delicate inner expressions. Today, she will perform her famous work "花田错" at Tianchan Stage for the benefit of the Zhengyanbao Education Fund. The performance is set to be perfect.

### Blood Rain and Jade Blossoms

Chapter Nineteen The Dusk When the Hu Cavalry Filled the City with Dust

Xu Jing also spurred his horse to catch up, shouting, "Liu brother, don't chase the desperate enemy, we should meet the main army crossing the river." Liu Yin's eyebrows furrowed, and he said to Xu Jing, "Little brother was careless and took an arrow in the leg." Xu Jing was startled and said, "Does it matter?" Liu Yin said, "It's generally not a serious injury." Xu Jing then dismounted from his saddle first, helped him down, and sat him down on the grass. The soldiers on the left and right held torches to illuminate the scene. Xu Jing lowered his head, only to see a feather-shafted arrow stuck in Liu Yin's left leg. Fortunately, it was shallow and had deviated, so it had not penetrated deeply. Xu Jing said to Liu Yin, "Brother Liu, quickly pull the arrow out and then we'll talk." Liu Yin nodded. Xu Jing bent down to lift up his battle robe, and Liu Yin untied his belt. He reached out and felt the arrow, gritted his teeth, pulled it out with a tug, and threw it on the ground. Fresh blood flowed out. Liu Yin then slowly rolled up his trousers, revealing snowy white and delicate flesh. Xu Jing looked at this fair leg, which looked just like a woman's, and his heart couldn't help but stir. He said, "Where is the wound?" Liu Yin rolled the trousers over the wound, only to see a very small wound that was constantly bleeding. Xu Jing then used his sword to cut a piece of cloth from his own lapel and wrapped it around the创痕for Liu Yin. He said to him, "I heard that General Bai Xianzong has excellent 金创良药. I will ask him for it tomorrow and apply it for you, and you will recover completely." Liu Yin said, "Thank you for Jing brother's kindness. Fortunately, the bones were not damaged, which is a great blessing in misfortune. I also gave that bastard a dart and knocked him off his horse. If it wasn't for little brother being injured, I would have rushed forward to tie that bastard up." (231)
