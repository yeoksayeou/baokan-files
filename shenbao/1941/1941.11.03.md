### Reports of U.S. Aid Arriving Before Japan Launches Military Action Against Yunnan; China Has Thorough Preparations at Yunnan-Vietnam Border, Attempt to Cut Off Burma Road Transport Doomed to Fail

Chongqing, 2nd (Havas) – The issue of Japan increasing its troops in Vietnam has become the most concerning issue for both government officials and private individuals here. According to reliable sources, "Government officials deeply believe that Japan intends to launch military action against Yunnan before the massive amount of U.S. aid arrives, in order to cut off transport along the Burma Road. However, China has made full preparations for this." This point was recently confirmed by Jiang Jieshi's political advisor, Lattimore. Lattimore returned from Kunming the day before yesterday, stating that although he did not go to the Yunnan-Vietnam border, he learned that Japan is indeed preparing for action in Vietnam, while China has made thorough preparations. Chairman Long and the people of Yunnan are also determined to resist strongly. As for Japan's propaganda of the so-called Greater Asianism to the people of Yunnan, it will definitely be ineffective. Furthermore, according to the observations of a certain foreign diplomat, Japan would need to use a large number of troops to attack Yunnan, and it would definitely require a large number of aircraft. However, the troops currently across the border are far from sufficient for this, and there are even fewer aircraft. Therefore, there is no possibility of launching an attack at present. If we add the treacherous terrain, deadly miasma, and the fact that Japan has not yet abandoned negotiations with the United States, it is doubtful whether we can launch this offensive.

London, 2nd (Reuters) – A special Reuters dispatch states that attention has been drawn here to the news spread by the German news agency Manira that Japan may be preparing to launch a serious attack on Thailand. It is believed that the denial by the Japanese authorities in Shanghai is deliberate and that the intention of this move seems to be to divert attention to cover up the possibility that Japan will launch an offensive against Yunnan Province in China. It is said that although the main supply line for Burma passes through Yunnan cities, there is another route that bypasses that area and goes through Chengdu to Jiading. This route has been under preparation for some time, and even if it is not yet open to traffic, it must be nearing completion. Therefore, there is no need to worry too much about the future of Chinese military supplies.

Negotiations All Fail; Tensions Rise Between U.S. and Japan

Washington, 1st (Havas) – A Columbia Broadcasting System announcer, when reporting on the current situation yesterday, strongly stated that political and diplomatic figures in Washington generally believe that tensions between the U.S. and Japan have become increasingly serious. It was also said that the recent rumors that the U.S. was negotiating with China and Britain to hand over Hong Kong and Singapore in Britain and four Chinese bases to the U.S. for use had aroused serious opposition from Japan. At the same time, various newspapers also portrayed the situation as serious, even predicting that U.S.-Japan relations would become acute in two weeks. The Minsheng Forum newspaper stated that the Japanese ambassador Nomura, in view of the ineffectiveness of all past efforts to promote U.S.-Japan friendship, is quite inclined to return to his country for a visit. The Times stated that since the U.S. should not make concessions to Japan, it is expected that Japan will soon take desperate measures. This pessimistic tone has been confirmed by frequent reports from Shanghai of Japanese troops concentrating in South China and North Vietnam.

The United Press, Washington, 2nd – Nazi Germany's accusation that the United States has attacked German submarines and begun a shooting war against Germany appears to be an attempt to invoke the Tripartite Pact. Diplomatic observers here believe that Japan, since joining the Axis Powers, is now undergoing the most serious test of its relationship with the Axis and democratic countries. Japan's international relations will become even more strained after the United States amends the Neutrality Act to allow American ships to enter war zones, as this move will enable a powerful American fleet to immediately join forces with the British fleet in the Atlantic and elsewhere, confronting Hitler with the most powerful enemy he has faced on the high seas since the start of the war. It is believed that Hitler wants to divert American attention to the Pacific and will try his best to get Japan to strike at the United States, thereby causing a U.S.-Japan crisis or conflict to weaken American intervention in the Atlantic. It is believed that the U.S. Navy will, to the extent possible, redeploy its forces in the Pacific, but will still maintain its main striking force in the Pacific in preparation for any Japanese action. At the same time, State Department officials, in commenting on Germany's accusation that the United States has begun a shooting war, declared that President Roosevelt's statement has clearly clarified the attitude of the United States. They stated that the German propagandists are clearly attempting to make countries that believe they are at risk of being attacked believe that they have the right to self-defense.

Germany Woos Japan to Launch War Against the U.S.

Washington, 2nd (United Press) – Unofficial sources here said yesterday that Nazi Germany's formal accusation that the United States has already begun an elbow-striking war against Germany by directly shooting at German submarines is actually a prelude to Germany's attempt to invoke the Tripartite Pact to drag Japan and Italy into an active war. The German claim that the U.S. destroyer "Kearny" first attacked a German submarine is tantamount to saying "the U.S. has attacked Germany" and indicates that Nazi officials are referring to Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact. It is widely believed that neither Italy nor Japan will react immediately, and it is believed that Italy is more likely to react than Japan, as Japan will carefully study who the aggressor is. According to the provisions of the Tripartite Pact, if any signatory is attacked by a third country that was not at war when the pact was signed, the other signatories shall come to the aid of the signatory under attack. However, each country has the right to determine which country initiated the aggression.

Chongqing, 2nd (Havas) – The diplomatic reporter of the Central Daily News, in the "International Weekly Review" column today, commented on the sinking of the Robin Moor incident, saying that in terms of the European situation, Germany currently has no need to attack the United States, nor is it necessary to retaliate because the United States has abolished the Neutrality Act. Therefore, the reason why it took this provocative action to drag the United States into the war is solely to reduce the threat of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific to Japan, so that it can feel at ease in taking action in the Far East. For a year, Germany has consistently failed to woo Japan, considering it a difficult task. Now, with the greatest determination, it has taken this last resort. However, Japan is still trying to gain without war, so it constantly threatens the U.S. and the Soviet Union to break up the U.S.-Soviet alliance in the Pacific, force the Soviet Union to resolve the so-called outstanding issues, and hope that the U.S. will allow it to obtain oil in the Dutch East Indies.

U.S. Destroyer Sunk; Many Believe the U.S. Will Join the War

Manila, 2nd (Reuters) – The U.S. Army and Navy are greatly angered by the news of the sinking of the Robin Moor, and the Navy is eager to try. This has become an open secret. The American military and civilians in the Philippines now believe that the U.S. participation in the war is inevitable, only asking when the U.S. will join the war. The news of the sinking of the Robin Moor arrived too late, so most newspapers did not have time to publish criticisms this morning. However, all newspapers published this news as a major event. The Philippine Mabuhay, the only Filipino newspaper, said that Hitler has clearly declared war on the U.S., but unfortunately, the feelings and opinions of the American people are still not unified at this critical moment. Americans are only talking, while Germany is already shooting.

Washington, 2nd (Reuters) – According to general opinion, the sinking of the U.S. destroyer Reuben James will cause some doubtful votes in the struggle for the amendment to the Neutrality Act to vote for the government side, because if they vote against it, it would seem to appease Hitler, who has now sunk an American ship. The diplomatic reporter of the Scripps newspapers holds this view and says that foreign envoys in Washington believe that after the Reuben James, there will inevitably be other ships that will suffer the same fate, forcing Congress to declare war. The U.S. and Germany are currently at war, just like China and Japan.

International News Agency, Berlin, 2nd – Yesterday, Chief Hitler strongly refuted President Roosevelt's Navy Day speech and pointed out that the U.S. wanted to use the destroyer's attack on German submarines to make the U.S. and Germany fall into a "real shooting war." According to Hitler, the documents mentioned by Roosevelt, which were used to show that Germany was trying to divide South America and abolish world religions, "are all forgeries." Hitler said, "The U.S. destroyers Greer and Kearny attacked German submarines before being hit by torpedoes. At this time, the shooting war had already begun. As for the map of South America and the German plan to abolish religion mentioned in President Roosevelt's speech, they were planned by countries other than Germany. The German government has notified all neutral countries, including those in Central and South America, that these documents are all forged." Hitler's remarks were made yesterday at the Eastern Front headquarters, and foreign journalists were also briefed at a special meeting for journalists in Berlin.

Japan Temporarily Refuses to Criticize Germany's Declaration

Tokyo, 2nd (United Press) – The Cabinet Information Bureau today refused to criticize Germany's declaration that the United States has begun a shooting war against Germany because its destroyers attacked German submarines, saying that it would not make any criticism until it received an official report. The Information Bureau said, "We must carefully study the entire text," because this matter is very important. Therefore, "it is too early to rush to a criticism, especially regarding Japan's obligations under the Tripartite Pact." Observers say the Japanese people seem prepared to accept Germany's declaration, as Navy Secretary Knox and other U.S. officials have publicly stated that the destroyer "Kearny" dropped depth charges before being attacked by a Nazi submarine. The Japanese people will consider this an American aggression against Germany, but they also say Japan's obligations to Germany under the Tripartite Pact remain unaffected.

Tokyo, 2nd (Reuters) – The Japanese News Agency published an article expressing Japan's thoughts on the international situation and declaring that Japan is prepared to deal with any situation. According to reliable observers, the increase in taxes and the rise in prices are the forces behind Tojo's completion of Japan's wartime preparations. Tojo does not rely on the U.S. to resolve the current difficulties, so he wants to seek the understanding of the public from the Diet. If the situation is allowed to change naturally, it will inevitably become worse. The solution depends entirely on the removal of the U.S. economic pressure on Japan. Foreign Minister Togo originally planned to leave Tokyo at the end of the week to visit the imperial tomb and shrines to report on his duties, but now he has postponed the trip, which is quite significant.

Japanese Newspapers Unanimously Criticize the U.S.

Tokyo, 2nd (United Press) – Tokyo Japanese newspapers today generally joined the Mainichi Shimbun and the Domei News Agency in attacking the U.S., saying that U.S.-Japan relations have now reached their worst point. The newspapers said that Japan can no longer allow the negotiations in Washington to continue to stall. The newspapers said that the only way to break the deadlock in U.S.-Japan relations is for the U.S. to stop its pressure on Japan, especially its economic pressure. The Chugai Commercial Shimbun said that although Japan has done its best to maintain peace in the Pacific, it cannot abandon its right to survive for the sake of peace in the Pacific and the world. The time to take action to protect this survival is gradually approaching. The Asahi Shimbun said that the U.S. underestimates Japan's strength and that the U.S.'s selfish policy in Tokyo is the greatest danger in the Pacific crisis.

British Opinion Generally Advocates Helping the U.S. Fight Japan

London – The British reaction to Prime Minister Tojo's speech is now one of firm, sarcastic, and angry attitudes. The Daily Telegraph's editorial is the sharpest rebuttal to Tojo's speech. Tojo said that Japan's mission to resolve the "China Incident" and establish the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is its greatest honor. The newspaper refuted this by saying, "Who authorized Japan to undertake the mission of slaughtering and robbing? Neither God nor mankind would authorize Japan to do so." Regarding Tojo's threat that the U.S. must make concessions to Japan by November 15, otherwise Japan will reaffirm its commitment to the Tripartite Pact and the Anti-Comintern Pact, qualified observers in Britain said that the U.S.'s condition is that Japan completely abandon its aggressive and expansionist behavior; otherwise, a conflict between the two sides cannot be avoided. Navy Secretary Knox has also issued this warning. If a shooting war does break out in the Pacific, Britain will not hesitate to help the U.S. fight. The British and American navies will form a two-ocean fleet. Observers also said that American public opinion supports going to war against Japan, and British public opinion also hates Japan's repeated threats and extortion. Therefore, British newspapers are currently maintaining a firm and consistent stance in resisting further Japanese aggression. (1st)

### Japanese Ship Taiyo Maru Arrives in Honolulu to Evacuate Nationals; War Between Japan and the U.S. Unlikely to Happen Soon

Honolulu, 2nd (United Press) – The Japanese ship "Taiyo Maru" arrived here yesterday from Japan, carrying 345 evacuating nationals. This move leads authorities here to believe that although anti-American movements are intense in Japan, it seems unlikely for the time being that any action that would involve the country in a war with the U.S. will be launched. The "Taiyo Maru" is scheduled to return to Tokyo after November 4, while the "Tatuta Maru" will leave the U.S. today. It is widely believed that Japan is unlikely to take any action while these two Japanese ships are within the range of U.S. air power. Among the passengers on the "Taiyo Maru," 15 were Americans, one was British, and the rest were Japanese. Most of the Americans on the "Taiyo Maru" were missionaries who had lived in Japan for a long time. According to Mr. Yamaguchi, a Japanese-American who was born in Honolulu and is a deputy prosecutor, "The Japanese people are tired of the war with China and do not want to continue it. However, they believe that land reclamation is the only way out due to economic pressure." According to Mr. Yamaguchi, he worked for a certain insurance company in Japan last year.

### Demarcation of Manchuria and Mongolia Completed

Kuybyshev, 2nd (Reuters) – Soviet spokesman Lozovsky announced here today previously unreleased news that the Mixed Committee for the Demarcation of Manchuria and Mongolia has completed its work and signed an agreement. The committee has left Harbin. It is said that the border between the two sides has now been clearly demarcated in an area 16 miles long between Buinor and Kalkin Gol. Kuybyshev, 2nd (Reuters) – Soviet government spokesman Lozovsky declined to criticize the formation of the new Japanese government, saying he would wait and see how it acted. Lozovsky also said the Soviet government hopes that the recent Soviet-Japanese incident on the Amur River was solely an action by local troops and that Tokyo would punish them.

### It is Rumored That the U.S. Ship That Was Torpedoed Had Sunk German Ships

Danville, U.S., 2nd (Reuters) – According to a letter sent by sailor Dickinson to his friends here last week, the U.S. destroyer Reuben James, which was torpedoed and sunk west of Iceland on the night of October 30, had sunk two German submarines and may have sunk other submarines.

### Actively Building Chongqing; New Buildings Increase; City Situation More Prosperous Than in Summer; However, Housing Problems Remain Serious

Chongqing – Chongqing has not been attacked for many days since being attacked in the summer. Contractors, carpenters, masons, and thatch roofers are all very busy repairing or building houses in preparation for the winter. Many shops have opened during the summer, and merchants have moved goods back into the city that were stored in safe places in the countryside during the summer. The city situation has been hindered by the rapid rise in prices. In areas that were targeted during the bombing season, such as the British Embassy, the Press Association, and many commercial streets, new buildings have now appeared. What is strange is that there are now more thatched roofs than tiled roofs, and even some well-built brick houses also have thatched roofs. Housing problems are still serious because new and old residents are arriving one after another, and there are also many foreigners coming, especially Americans (including military and economic delegations and foreign reporters). Therefore, the housing problems of foreigners are also very tense. (2nd United Press dispatch)

### Xi'an Eastern Suburbs: Discovery of Hidden Gold – Totaling 640 Taels –

Xi'an. Guangxu in Changlefang, outside the eastern gate of Xi'an, was originally the site of the Tang Dynasty ruins. Over the years, it has become a public burial ground, with countless coffins buried there. On the 27th of last month, around noon, citizens Guo Yonglu and others carried a coffin to the site for burial. While digging five feet deep, they discovered an iron box covered in rust, containing gold dust of varying sizes. The local police took the iron box and its contents to the station for examination. It was found to contain a total of 640 taels of gold, seven taels of rust, and the iron box weighed over ninety market catties. The police station has already reported this to the provincial government, intending to offer it to the central government. According to experts familiar with Chang'an's ancient sites, the location where the gold was discovered is the former site of the Tang Dynasty's Xingqing Palace.

Editorial

### The Cancer of the Pacific

Even after the change of the Japanese cabinet, the exploratory talks between the United States and Japan have not been interrupted. Until recently, the contact between the two sides has continued to be maintained. Those who regard the establishment of the Tojo Cabinet as Japan's continued adherence to a prudent route seem to have obtained a factual proof in this regard. However, even if the talks have not been interrupted, hope has become increasingly weak. To this day, there is no room for opinions appeasing Japan, and no one dares to be optimistic about the future of this talk. Therefore, public opinion in Japan has turned to another extreme of pessimism. After the establishment of the Tojo Cabinet, it was decided to convene a special Diet in mid-month. It is said that the Japanese spokesman in Washington once stated that a dangerous situation may occur after the Japanese Diet convenes on the 15th of this month, and Japanese newspapers have also stated that US-Japan relations will become acute in two weeks. This cancer of the Pacific, truly, has reached the stage of festering, and it is a problem that should be given serious attention.

Examining the main cause of the formation of this cancer is Japan's attempt to establish a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and what has contributed to the development of this cancer is the advantage created by the Axis countries in the European war. Therefore, even though the idea of "New Order" and "Co-Prosperity Sphere" was put forward by Konoe three years ago, its actual threat was created after the defeat of Britain and France last summer. Recently, as the Nazis made a desperate effort to make progress in the battles around Moscow and the Don River basin, the situation in the Pacific has suddenly become tense. If the Nazis' military strength and power had not always been a major threat to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the Far East issue would not have been so difficult. The US authorities have always regarded the annihilation of the Nazis as the first priority, and from this point of view, there is considerable reason for this. However, the outbreak of the Far East Incident was far earlier than the Nazis' seizure of power. The Axis's aggressive actions undoubtedly learned a model from the Far East. Therefore, even if the threat of the Nazis is lifted, it will certainly help the future of the Far East situation, but the crisis in the Pacific cannot be fundamentally eliminated because of this. The ambiguous attitude of the Tripartite Pact and the fact that the US-Japan talks can continue to this day are all based on this reason. The response to the crisis in the Far East must be made with effective considerations in addition to the development of the European war.

The first thing that needs to be confirmed is the basis of Japan's expansionist attempt. Everyone knows that Japan is still waiting—waiting for a more favorable opportunity. If the Nazis defeat the Soviet Union and the attention of Britain and the United States is drawn to the dangerous waves of the Atlantic, then in the eyes of some people, the overall situation in the Far East will naturally be isolated, and the southward and northward advances will be suitable for everything. However, the convenience that opportunity can provide is only half the effort, and it is by no means an absolute gain without labor. In any case, it will still be necessary to pay the lowest possible capital and price. Unless this capital has been completely exhausted, the delusion of expansion will not be subdued. Four years of hard fighting have certainly caused considerable fatigue, but it is also because of being in war for a long time that the whole country can gradually conform to the wartime system. The formation of a combat mechanism allows it to strengthen and intensify a high degree of wartime system in the past year, and it is not an empty word. The peaceful industry has shrunk unprecedentedly, but it has greatly increased military production. Although it cannot get a sufficient supply of resources under economic sanctions, its efforts to search for it are not without success. The strength after a long war, even if others think it is vulnerable, it may not be self-confident that it can still try. What's more, in recent years, the results of its naval and air force expansion have always been kept secret. Even if it may not have amazing miracles, focusing on building the military is by no means without results. Therefore, the so-called completion of the combat mechanism, whether we still want to discount it, it should be confirmed that this is the root cause of the Far East crisis. The arms race among the great powers a few years ago proved that they would inevitably be involved in the war sooner or later. If a person is indeed tightening his belt to exchange for cannons, no one will believe that he will only use weapons as a means of showing off his power in hunger.

The repeated delays in the Far East crisis do not mean that it will not eventually erupt, but only that one side is delaying waiting for an opportunity to seek greater strength, and the other side is conducting tests to see if those who uphold justice can be deceived by their side. The US-Japan negotiations in the past two months have been time-consuming and harmful, and have been criticized by the world, but they are not without gain. At least they have proved that the United States strictly adheres to its consistent position and does not allow interference. Whether it is to use sweet words or intimidation, it is not enough to change its determined attitude. This situation is not enough to eliminate the Pacific crisis, at least it has made those who want to be lucky understand the seriousness of the situation. If they must seek the satisfaction of greed, they must pay the little remaining capital. This situation naturally does not allow negligence, and this is the reason why a seemingly gentle and prudent regime can be produced. As for what is hidden inside this gentle cloak, it is to enrich the wartime system to the maximum extent. The convocation of the Provisional Diet is probably of greater significance internally than externally. The so-called dangerous situation that may occur after the 15th is still mostly intimidation, and naturally things like attacking the Yunnan-Burma Road may happen at any time.

Today's South Pacific is naturally not as exposed as it was before, but in terms of response, it is undeniable that it is not strong enough. Therefore, it is still not enough to contain the outbreak of unexpected chaos. There is naturally no doubt about the future outcome, but we should seek to reduce the scope of the disaster and increase efficiency. Now that it is full of gunpowder everywhere, if a spark is found, it must be extinguished immediately. Once it spreads, everything will be very troublesome.

### Thailand Desperately Wants to Maintain Neutrality Under Japanese Overt Threats to Avoid Provoking Japanese Hostile Actions Against Thailand. Thailand's Only Guarantee is British and American Aid.

Reuters, Bangkok, 2nd. Sheehan, a New York correspondent, broadcast from Yangon, saying that Thailand's current position is that Thailand is currently under overt threat from Japanese military action. Thailand is extremely unwilling to give the Japanese side an excuse for hostile actions, so it maintains extremely strict neutrality, like Belgium and the Netherlands in the past. Now, there is only one shelter to defend against aggressors, that is, the British government's war efforts are supported by the United States. A spokesman for the Thai government praised this broadcast last night, saying that it was very fair and objectively and sympathetically disclosed the feelings in Thailand. This is a good contribution that a foreign journalist can make in his position. He was unwilling to criticize Sheehan's expectation that Japan might advance into Thailand, but felt that Sheehan had explained the spirit of Thailand to neighboring countries.

Reuters, Bangkok, 2nd. The Thai Minister of Economy yesterday submitted two bills to the National Assembly to increase the national tax on tin and tungsten production in Thailand. These two cases have been passed at the first reading. The national tax on tin sand will increase from three baht to five baht per load (approximately half a pound in British gold). The national tax on tungsten sand will increase from 10% to between 11% and 12% based on the Bangkok market price. The Minister of Economy said that the tungsten sand business is still good, and that Thai tungsten sand is priced higher than that in the Straits Settlements. Mr. Dole, a British financial advisor to the Thai government, reviewed Thailand's budget and general financial situation over the past two years, saying that the scope of Thailand's finances is indeed not very large, but its position today is no worse than other countries. The budget is balanced, and the balance of international debt is favorable to the Thai currency. Thailand's reserves reach 110%, of which gold accounts for more than 42%. What Thailand lacks is national capital, but the cooperative movement is now gradually taking effect.

### Japanese Veterans Association Holds Parade

### The Beginning and End of Roosevelt and Churchill's Meeting in the Atlantic (1)

US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill held a historic meeting somewhere in the North Atlantic in mid-August. The details of the meeting are described below with reference to British and American newspapers and magazines.

On the afternoon of August 16, 1941, in the damp and old dock reception room in Oakland Harbor, Maine, USA, there were fifty anxious and frustrated people, either sitting or standing. They were all news reporters, photographers, and wireless radio reporters. They had been waiting for a long time—two weeks in Swinscott, Massachusetts, and two days in Rockland.

The heavy fog that had enveloped the distance of Benos Scott Bay all day had gradually dissipated. At about 3 o'clock, the people on the dock glimpsed the President's yacht "Potomac," with its large head and comfortable body, appearing near the breakwater, and saw the naval patrol ship "California" guarding it back and forth.

At this time, the broadcasters used a series of excited tones to talk endlessly into the loudspeaker, and the police were also fully focused. The blue-gray "Potomac" slowly approached the dock, returning safely from the mysterious realm of the Atlantic.

President Roosevelt's departure from the White House this time, making a tour of more than tens of thousands of miles, lasted exactly thirteen days, most of which were not made public. People generally only knew that he was holding a mysterious meeting at sea.

When the yacht docked, the first thing the President did was announce that he would meet with reporters on the yacht. Beforehand, he had received a wireless report that the reporter group was waiting on the dock, so he sat quietly in the cabin, calm and happy. President's confidant Hopkins sat aside. The president lit a Camel cigarette and told the fat ones that there was no news to tell, only that Mr. Churchill had established a complete understanding in all aspects of the war. He also said that the Soviet Union could support the entire winter, and would continue to resist after receiving full assistance from the United States next spring, but the United States did not get closer to the war because of his trip.

When a New York Times reporter asked about the situation of the meeting at sea, the President said that he was very willing to talk about the impressions of this trip. The first was a grand service held on the quarterdeck of the British's newest battleship "Prince of Wales" on Sunday morning, with all the officers and men of the ship participating together. Two or three hundred sailors from the American cruiser "Augusta" sat with them, and their spirits were very harmonious. The service was led by pastors from the United States and Britain, but the sermon was given by the British captain to conform to naval customs.

Because the President was unable to walk, he and Prime Minister Churchill decided to hold the meeting alternately. In addition to holding a meeting on the British ship, the rest were held on the "Augusta." The President said that he had been with Churchill for more than a day, talking about the situation in all continents of the world. Every part of every level was talked about.

The President said that this meeting was jointly initiated by him and Churchill, and the motivation was in February of this year, but the scheduled meeting was postponed by three months due to the wars in Greece and Crete.

A reporter asked the President that the eight points of peace policy jointly announced by the President and Churchill did not mention how to destroy the "Nazi tyranny." The President replied that this view was too narrow. The main purpose of this meeting was to exchange various views on the present and the future.

Another reporter asked if he and Churchill had established a complete understanding in all aspects of the war. He replied: Yes, I think it is so.

Someone else asked: "Has the United States become closer to the war because of this?" The President said no. But reporters were not allowed to add quotation marks to this sentence as the President's own statement.

As for how the meeting between him and Churchill was completed, the President said that the two sides would further exchange opinions.

"Does the Soviet Union have to fulfill these eight principles?" a reporter asked. The President replied that no one had thought of this before the reporter asked, but it was mentioned in the meeting that the needs of the Soviet Union should be taken into account in the plan to build up arms.

This need is divided into two categories: one is various urgent military supplies to be transported to the Soviet Union before this winter, and the other is various military supplies for fighting next spring.

Someone asked the President if he had any doubts about the Soviet Union's determination to fight to the end. The President replied that he believed that the Soviet Union could fight to the end, based on what he had just said.

Finally, the President also said that he was slightly isolated from the recent situation in France and the Far East, but he would discuss it at length with Secretary of State Hull after returning to Washington tomorrow.

The yacht entered the port at 3 o'clock, and at 4 o'clock, the President and his party disembarked, took a car to the station, and took the 4:10 train back to the capital.

The cruiser "Augusta" of 9,050 tons, which President Roosevelt took to the meeting, was the warship of the original US Asian Fleet, and the people of Shanghai had seen it in the Huangpu River. Churchill took the newest battleship "Prince of Wales" of 35,000 tons. Both sides also had multiple escort ships, and their combined strength was enough to cope with any large-scale naval battle.

The gathering place for the ships was mostly Newfoundland in the North Atlantic, or in Plaza Saintia Bay, not far from the new large-scale US naval base under construction. The coastline there is rugged and the meeting period is in the fog season.

The meeting date was August 9th and 10th. First, Churchill, with a long cigar in his mouth, strode onto the "Augusta." He was wearing a dark blue naval uniform, and the eight copper buttons on his chest had been darkened by the ashes falling from his mouth. The ankle-length boots on his feet were originally making a clicking sound, but now they were only half audible. He first handed a letter to President Roosevelt and said hello: "Mr. President, it is an honor to greet you on behalf of His Majesty."

Roosevelt smiled and thanked him. The British Prime Minister was short and fat, with a curved back and a red face. He had a dog-like jaw, and a hat with a brim covered his sparse yellow hair. He stood with a charming smile, like a shy little angel, making people love him. The American head of state was tall and generous, with a stubborn jaw and thick shoulders leaning back. His head and neck were to one side, and he always did this when he came to new and important things.

This was just the situation of their first meeting on August 9th. They were already on a deeper level of friendship before they parted. The next day, Sunday, the "Augusta" approached the "Prince of Wales," and the President crossed the gangway to participate in the service. After that, the meeting was held on the "Augusta."

Regarding the situation of a certain meeting, the London Daily Mail recorded the conversation of an American official, which is as follows:

It is difficult to say who was more happy than the other between the President and Prime Minister Churchill during the various meetings. They had been talking on the Atlantic long-distance telephone for several months, and they knew each other deeply. So when they met, it was like old friends meeting again. After greeting each other, they started talking about various issues enthusiastically.

### Wu Tiecheng Calls on All Countries to Strengthen Unity, Prevent Cancer in the Pacific, and Resist Aggressors Together

United Press, Chongqing, 2nd. General Wu Tiecheng urged the ABCD front to be consolidated when broadcasting on International Peace Movement Anniversary. He said, "We must not make this front a front like a blank piece of paper, but we must make it a concrete and solid front. We can learn a lesson from the forgotten small European countries, and we want to prevent cancer in the Pacific." He also said, "If Vietnam and Thailand become the second Bulgaria, we should all rise up to take joint action for the safety of the masses." Wu recalled his tour of Nanyang last winter, and the people there were extremely grateful for Wu's preferential treatment. He said, "I am deeply moved by the fact that the people of your country and other places, for the reason that China itself has suffered, regardless of what methods the aggressors take, can sympathize with our country regardless of race." Wu continued, China has done its responsibility to strengthen the ABCD money. "But we still need assistance, and not only spiritual assistance, but also practical assistance, and effective assistance and close cooperation."

### Japanese Ship Will Make Singapore to Evacuate Overseas Chinese

United Press, Singapore, 2nd. Reliable sources claim that the Japanese ship "Asama Maru" will arrive here on November 15 to evacuate the remaining Japanese living here.

### American Isolationists Attack Neutrality Amendments

Havas, New York, 1st. Navy Secretary Knox delivered a speech at the Marine Corps banquet today, stating that the United States will participate in this war to the end. United Press, Washington, 2nd. Isolationist leaders continued to attack the government's diplomatic policy yesterday, allowing the amendment of the Neutrality Act so that the government could arm merchant ships. However, the amendment is currently being considered by the Senate, and they have little hope of blocking it. Missouri Democratic Senator Clark said that once the Neutrality Act is amended, it will cause the world to suffer "unlimited" war. He opposed "sacrificing the blood of American youth" to participate in the war. He also denounced Navy Secretary Colonel Knox, saying that he "seems to have been bitten by a mad dog and arbitrarily announced a century-long alliance with Britain without the permission of the Constitution." He also said that if President Roosevelt believes that it is necessary to fight to protect the security of the United States, he can send a message to Congress to request a declaration of war. However, Minnesota Republican Senator Bauer said that if the proposal to amend the Neutrality Act is rejected, the United States may be at war alone on both oceans with the victorious Germany and Japan at the same time.

### Sir Wavell Arrives in Singapore

Reuters, Singapore, 2nd. Sir Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, arrived here this morning with his staff.

### Rumor that Xinjiang Lacks Gasoline

Reuters, North Xia Hua, 2nd. It is rumored that China's Xinjiang Province is feeling a great shortage of gasoline. It is reported that the Indian government, in response to a request from the Chinese Commissioner in Kashgar, has expressed its willingness to provide a limited amount of gasoline, but the province's difficulty in oil shortage may not be greatly reduced as a result. The province has now severely restricted the sale of gasoline to the public.

### Canadian Prime Minister Goes to the United States to Meet Roosevelt

Reuters, New York, 2nd. Canadian Prime Minister King arrived here yesterday by special train from Ottawa. He told news reporters in the car that he came here to have a two-day meeting with President Roosevelt. It is also expected that the conversation will involve all events in the current situation related to the two countries. He thought that the two sides would talk about everything. When asked by a reporter if he expected to return to Canada with a complete understanding, King replied that a complete understanding already existed. At the same time, Princess Juliana of the Netherlands and her two children also arrived here by another special train.

United Press, Hyde Park, 2nd President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King began important talks on the continent and the Western Hemisphere yesterday, and later admitted that the two would review every issue in the international situation. According to some information, the two will also study economic and military events to make the wartime relationship between the United States and Canada closer. The public believes that this decision conference can be seen in the fact that the Canadian National Assembly will listen to the speech of Lord Attlee, the British Lord Privy Seal, when it is convened on Monday. King refused to comment on the US Navy, which is stationed in the North Atlantic, to guarantee the safety of Halifax Harbor, an important Canadian base, so that the British Navy can concentrate its attention on the Atlantic east of Iceland.

### Turkish President's Report on the International Situation

Reuters, Ankara, 2nd - Turkish President İsmet İnönü, in a report on the political situation during the Turkish parliament's reopening yesterday, stated that there is a risk of war spreading. Turkey's relations with belligerent nations are now restricted by new and old agreements since Turkey declared neutrality. All of these agreements are fully effective. Turkey's relationship with Germany was most difficult during the Balkan campaign. At that time, Hitler was deeply aware of our interests and concerns and personally sent a cordial letter to me expressing Germany's friendship towards our country. The Turkish government approved and I responded to Germany's reply, creating an atmosphere of trust, forming the basis for the German-Turkish agreement of June 18th. Since then, the development of Turkish-German relations has been very satisfactory.

Associated Press, Ankara, 2nd - Although Turkey is surrounded by belligerent nations, there is still hope for peace. Therefore, Turkish President General İsmet İnönü expressed yesterday his willingness to act as a mediator for belligerent countries. However, he also warned all nations that Turkey will still fight to protect its independence. General İnönü stated during the Turkish parliament session, "We will not succumb to military action under any circumstances." The president pointed out that Turkey will not allow any country, whether Britain or Germany, to occupy the country by military force. He also stated that Turkey's relationship with Germany is based on friendly relations, while its relationship with allied Britain is based on the Anglo-Turkish alliance.

### Large Quantities of American Military Supplies Arrive in Turkey

International News Service, Washington, 1st - Authoritative sources revealed yesterday that Britain has shipped "large quantities" of American military supplies to Turkey under the Lend-Lease program and has notified the US government. This news was initially revealed by the Turkish capital's radio station. It is claimed that American-made howitzers and other weapons were visible during a major review of the Turkish army. In response to inquiries, US authorities stated that large quantities of American vehicles have been shipped to Turkey. This move may indicate that if Turkey supports Britain and breaks with Germany, Turkey can rely on American assistance. Washington officials did not disclose the types and quantities of weapons shipped to Turkey due to military relations. However, it is understood that the administrator of the Lend-Lease program is currently compiling a detailed report on this matter. It is rumored that the first batch of American supply ships sailed to Turkey shortly after the fall of Greece. However, it is also rumored that Turkey already possesses sufficient British and French aircraft for use, so even if war breaks out in the Near East, there is no need for American aircraft assistance. At the same time, observers stated, "Large-scale military preparations are currently underway in the Near East." It is rumored that British forces are concentrating on preparing to establish a southern front against Germany in the spring. In addition, the railway lines in Iraq and Egypt are being repaired and improved to ensure sufficient supply lines when the war begins.

### Red Army Counterattacks in Central Sector, Recaptures Northern Part of Kalinin. Fierce Battles Rage Around Moscow. Germany Announces Capture of Simferopol.

Havas, London, 2nd - A radio station here has just broadcast the news that as a result of the Red Army's counterattack in the central sector, it has recovered half of the city of Kalinin, northwest of Moscow.

Reuters, German Führer Headquarters, 2nd - The German High Command announced this afternoon that German and Romanian troops captured Simferopol, the capital of Crimea, yesterday. They are now advancing towards Sevastopol.

Reuters, Moscow, 2nd - A military commentator on the local radio station stated that the battle for Kalinin, 100 miles northwest of Moscow, is now intensifying. German troops are resisting the Soviet counterattack. At night, German troops are burning suburban houses to illuminate the area for their defense against Soviet advances under the cover of darkness. Although German artillery fire is extremely fierce, Soviet troops have still recaptured a stronghold in the northern part of the city and are continuing to attack. Soviet motor torpedo boats sank three enemy ships and damaged another in the Baltic Sea.

Reuters, London, 2nd - A special German communiqué announced that Simferopol, the capital of Crimea, has been captured. The Soviets also admitted that the situation on the peninsula is very serious. It is reported that the German-Romanian allied forces are now advancing towards Sevastopol, 40 miles southwest of the city. It is believed that this important Black Sea naval base is under continuous air raids. German troops are still being held back outside the outer defenses of Moscow. The Soviets anticipate that the fighting may intensify again at any time. In the Donets River basin, the Soviets are currently resisting the Nazi advance towards Rostov and have reportedly made some progress. German propaganda claims to have occupied some industrial areas, but German troops are encountering great difficulties in the waterlogged areas north of the mouth of the Don River. Today's German communiqué did not mention the fighting on the Moscow front. However, Moscow radio stated that the calm atmosphere in that area over the past few days will soon be broken. It is reported that large numbers of German reserves are concentrated in the Volokolamsk and Kalinin areas. The Soviet army is vigorously resisting the Nazi attacks on Tula. According to a reporter from Red Star, the most dangerous point in the Moscow war at present is in the Tula and Kalinin areas. The fighting in the Tula area continued day and night on Saturday and Sunday. Although the Germans suffered heavy losses, their offensive has not weakened. The Soviets have been forced to retreat after repelling the main German force. In other areas of the Moscow front, such as Mozhaisk and Volokolamsk, the Soviet positions have been strengthened, and repeated local counterattacks have also been successful. German troops around Leningrad are very anxious about the issue of supplies. The Soviet Union has obtained the truth from prisoners of war, knowing that German soldiers lack clothing. The German trenches are wet and cold, and the soldiers are terrified of the approaching winter. According to a supplementary communiqué released by the Soviet side, a Soviet regiment annihilated a German infantry company in yesterday's fighting, destroyed multiple flat-trajectory guns, and captured a large number of machine guns and bullets. In addition, the Soviet air force, active on the southern front, bombed and destroyed 16 German tanks and 100 trucks, and killed 700 infantrymen.

Havas, Stockholm, 2nd - The fighting on the outer lines of Moscow continues, with the three regions of Tula, Kalinin, and Volokolamsk being the most intense. The two armies are advancing and retreating against each other. The fate of Moscow depends entirely on the outcome of this battle. German troops are actively reinforcing, attempting to take the city in one fell swoop.

Associated Press, London, 2nd - Reports from yesterday morning indicate that German troops are reinforcing their attacks on Kalinin to the north of Moscow and Tula, 120 miles south of Moscow. It is expected that the German army will launch a larger new attack, as they are strengthening their reinforcements, hoping to capture the city before winter arrives.

TASS, Northern Front, 2nd - A TASS correspondent stated that Soviet border troops achieved great success in fighting at a certain point. They penetrated deep into the enemy lines, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Our army was very successful in its night attacks. The night before last, Suikov's troops penetrated deep behind enemy lines and fought with the enemy for three hours. As a result, the German side suffered 200 casualties. Our army also destroyed five enemy aircraft, two anti-aircraft guns, and one radio station.

The Soviet Union Has Abundant Production. There Is No Need To Worry About A Protracted War.

Reuters, London, 2nd - Moscow Radio relayed yesterday's discussion in the Red Star newspaper, stating that Hitler now wants to end the war as soon as possible, but we are the ones who have the ability to end the war. The further the German army advances, the more resistance centers it will encounter. This resistance has new sources of supply constantly replenished, and this replenishment is as inexhaustible as Soviet manpower. We will achieve the complete collapse of the enemy at any cost. We have just begun to develop domestic resources. Siberia has unlimited prospects. The Urals have become a prosperous and powerful industrial center, with several of Europe's largest arsenals. Siberia produces huge amounts of coal, Gagar Kekantan produces various metals, and Altai is also preparing to develop its vast resources with newly arrived workers. The loss of industry in the western regions of the Soviet Union only means that work is intensified tenfold in areas that the enemy cannot reach. Although the Germans have gained something, their position is not as stable as before, because what the Germans have seized are not industrial towns, but scorched earth and flooded land. Soviet factories that have been moved to the east have now begun their new production, and in many cases, the quantities are even greater than before. Germany is worried about the prolongation of the war, so the German authorities have to make statements that the German army has completely occupied the fertile areas of the Soviet Union and that the Soviet Union is poor outside of Moscow to comfort their people.

After Retreating From Various Cities, The Soviets Scorched The Earth, And The Germans Gained Nothing.

Havas, Rome, 1st - "The People of Rome" recently published a dispatch from a German-Soviet war correspondent stating that all the Soviet towns occupied by the German army have been set ablaze by the Red Army before retreating. For example, Lviv, Berdichev, Nikolaev, and Kyiv have all become scorched earth and there is nothing left. "The Fascist Political System News" also carried a dispatch from a special reporter stating that five days before the German army occupied the city of Kyiv, ordinary people could not have imagined that the city would soon fall. But on September 22nd, the sound of destruction and explosions began to be heard incessantly. Three hours later, all types of buildings and important streets were destroyed by explosions, and the fire spread throughout the entire city.

Truth Daily Urges Soviet Citizens To Intensify Activities To Strike At The Nazis.

TASS, Moscow, 2nd - Yesterday, Truth Daily wrote, "The war has entered its fifth month, and the enemy has lost confidence in victory. The date for settling accounts with the dead Soviet patriots is near. Compatriots in Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Galicia, and all occupied areas, quickly organize guerrilla units and destroy the fascist villains. A temporary victory will not help Hitler. Fascism will be destroyed. The front has received all necessary assistance. Mechanics, working men and women, and technicians, quickly manufacture more aircraft, tanks, artillery, and small cannons. Collective farmers, the fascists want to seize your assets and enslave you, quickly harvest more food to help the front. We will quickly help the front with everything."

TASS, Battlefield Report, 2nd - Recently, the German fascist troops have intensified their offensive towards Crimea. Our army, in addition to resisting bravely, has also launched counterattacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The fighting at the bridgehead is very fierce. Our army has recaptured the bridgehead and two high grounds, and three villages, annihilating two battalions of enemy infantry.

### Iranian King Reiterates Compliance With Anglo-Iranian Treaty

Reuters, 2nd, Badreh - During yesterday's meeting of the Iranian parliament, the King's representative gave a speech reiterating the promise to fulfill the Anglo-Iranian treaty, stating that this policy has the unanimous support of the Iranian people and has always been followed by the various Iranian cabinets, and is supported by the most progressive Arab nations. Britain's explicit promise to assist the Arab nations who have not yet gained their independence shows its goodwill, and the King expresses his gratitude to this allied country. He expressed his gratitude to Britain, America, Egypt, Hejaz, and Outer Jordan for their friendly and noble attitude towards Iran when Iran faced difficulties. He then spoke of the troubles of the upper classes, saying that fortunately, they were quelled before causing great harm to the country. The government will adopt a strict attitude towards those who violate the constitution and national discipline. The government now aims to strengthen the army in terms of equipment and discipline, and wants to eliminate various reasons that use the army as a tool, making it unable to fulfill its duties in defending the country. According to the provisions of the Anglo-Iranian treaty, Iran should assist Britain in all important aspects during wartime.

### Italian Military Industry Increases Capital

Associated Press, Rome, 2nd - The cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini, decided yesterday to increase the capital of the military industry in order to cope with Italy's increased war work and various issues. The cabinet meeting, convened at the Venice residence, authorized a tenfold increase in loans to the military industry, including the Breda factory, which manufactures aircraft, tanks, and vehicles, the Pirelli rubber factory, the Montecatini chemical factory, and the Ilva steel factory. At the same time, food auditor and Minister of Agriculture Dassinari ordered all Italian pastures to be used for wheat planting in order to increase wheat supply to meet wartime needs. The government also intends to issue another order at the same time, increasing the price of salt used in industry and agriculture by 50% from November 1st. Salt is a state monopoly.

### Rumor of Imminent British Cabinet Reshuffle

Associated Press, London, 2nd - Member of Parliament Granville stated in a luncheon speech that he expects a reshuffle of the British cabinet, which will include Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook and Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax. He said that a cabinet reshuffle is currently considered inevitable, but what is surprising is that this reshuffle will include Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Halifax, and personnel from the Foreign Office. Prime Minister Churchill will make his cabinet a cabinet to win the war. Lord Beaverbrook and Labor Minister Bevin must reduce various other responsibilities in order to devote all their efforts to the war cabinet.

### British Labor Minister Urges The People To Work Hard And Prepare In Order To Assist The Soviet Union And Overthrow Hitler

Reuters, London, 2nd - British Labor Minister Bevin, a member of the War Cabinet, spoke last night in Swansea, saying that if the British people spend their money and energy this winter to prepare for Hitler's attack on England next spring, they will have the opportunity to witness Hitler's funeral in the summer. Britain is responsible for equipping and supplying the Soviet Union, so we must have a large number of soldiers for their use. The British government wants the whole country to be prepared. Prime Minister Churchill has absolute trust in all British men and women.

### British Fund for the Relief of China Donates Sewing Machines

Since Madam Kong, the standing committee member of the Chongqing New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee's production business group, arrived in Chongqing, the group's work has made great progress. Madam Kong once borrowed credit loans worth over one million yuan on behalf of the group for silkworm and cotton production in Sichuan Province. Recently, the group urgently needed sewing machines to sew winter clothes for wounded soldiers and orphans. Madam Kong entrusted Madam Selwyn-Clarke, honorary secretary of the Overseas Auxiliary Committee of the Chinese Red Cross, to purchase 40 machines and donate them to the group. It is reported that Madam Selwyn-Clarke wrote to Madam Kong, saying that the sewing machines would be donated by the British Fund for the Relief of China in Hong Kong and the Overseas Auxiliary Committee of the Red Cross. She also said that if she could be of slight service in the future, such as supplying tools and goods, she would be happy to comply and would be honored to do so. (1st dispatch)

### Three Principles For Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices, Respectfully Submitted

High prices have become commonplace in Shanghai in recent years, but the current surge and plunge, like the rapid ascent and dive of an airplane, is unprecedented. The daily rise of gold prices by thousands seems to indicate that the legal tender has become like the German mark/ruble in the last European war; however, the simultaneous daily plunge of yarn prices by thousands clearly shows that it is not a crisis of the legal tender itself. Social consensus has long recognized that hoarding and speculation are the main reasons for today's high prices. Except in lawless areas, such rampant behavior should not be allowed to continue. If Shanghai has entered an era of lawlessness, then the fact that there are police every five steps and soldiers every ten steps, with strict laws and decrees, would also negate the efforts of the authorities. The problem, then, is not a lack of human effort, but a lack of effective methods. How to suppress and stabilize prices? Nothing is better than cracking down on hoarding and speculation! This has long been the consensus. However, how to crack down on hoarding and speculation? The efforts of all parties are still needed.

In its editorial on the first, this newspaper proposed three points: (1) Crack down on existing hoarding and prevent hoarding after the supply is remitted for import. (2) End existing bank loans for goods and crack down on banks continuing to make loans in the future. (3) Crack down on gold trading and eliminate the clues for general commodity speculation. These three points are the basic principles for suppressing and stabilizing prices in this city. Without them, market stability cannot be achieved in the future.

Although the supply of legal tender is limited, the unlimited rise in prices still requires an equivalent amount of currency to match it. How can the limited supply of legal tender adapt to today's unlimited rise in prices? Obviously, the expansion of bank currency is fueling it. Goods stored in warehouses mean that currency is circulating outside; banks making loans for goods are both increasing speculation and hoarding and increasing the supply of currency in the market. Therefore, cracking down on hoarding and prohibiting loans can directly restrain commodity speculation and indirectly contract the currency in the market. Preventing the hoarding and speculation of commodities will naturally balance the supply and demand of goods. The expansion of bank currency will also lose its basis. Stopping bank loans will deprive hoarding and speculation of its backing, and the supply of currency in the market can be greatly reduced. Therefore, both must be advanced simultaneously to be effective.

Hoarding and speculation have only two purposes: one is to take the opportunity to profit, and the other is to disguise capital flight. Both are caused by the sharp rise in gold prices. In theory, commodity prices under the legal tender system should no longer be linked to gold prices; however, the monetary thinking of metal standards is still deeply rooted in people's hearts. When gold prices rise sharply, people generally believe that it is a devaluation of the legal tender and that it is the level of general price increases. In today's world, all countries have banned gold exports; therefore, when the demand exceeds the supply in the gold market of a certain place, there is no possibility of natural adjustment. Therefore, scarcity is valued, and it is bound to increase without decreasing. It is not initially a devaluation of the currency, but the result is to promote the devaluation of the currency. Although the basis of the currency system is not harmed, the level of commodity prices is inevitably greatly affected. In this case, there are only two paths to take: if you do not correct people's minds, you should fundamentally eliminate its transactions. Correcting people's minds is, in fact, impossible; therefore, banning free gold trading is the only countermeasure adopted by countries in the world today. Our country has already adopted this system, but Shanghai alone remains free. Therefore, in order to cut off the adverse effects of gold prices on commodity prices, the authority of the concession authorities must be used as a backing. Otherwise: although the concession authorities can focus on cracking down on hoarding and banks stopping loans, if they still allow speculation in the gold market, it will still cause hoarding and speculation to revive and loan transactions to re-emerge. Because the rise in gold prices is calling for huge profits in hoarding and speculation, and loan transactions cannot be completely eradicated.

This publication once had a suggestion from Mr. Da Ke: (1) The Exchange Equalization Fund should give priority to supplying rice and coal, and should not treat other applicants in the same way. Because the stability of the rice and coal market can reduce the general public's panic about the decline in currency value. (2) The Exchange Equalization Fund should designate several commercial firms to handle the import of essential goods and be responsible for guaranteeing that the foreign exchange they apply for is actually used for the purpose of the application; and use the foreign exchange obtained from the application as the standard for determining the price of imported goods. (3) The British and American governments should declare that all import drafts within Chinese territory are invalid unless they have been stamped and approved by the Exchange Equalization Fund. In addition to the third point, which still requires the assistance of the British and American governments, the first point has already been clearly announced by the Exchange Equalization Fund that the continued supply of foreign exchange for rice and coal is seamless, and the second point is being supported by the concession authorities to organize an import merchants association, which is generally expected to have the same effect. However, this is still limited to adjusting the source, and the adjustment of the circulation process still depends on the realization of the above three principles.

### How to Stop Prices from Rising Sharply

— Chen Huazhang

Over the past twenty days, prices have risen sharply. Apart from speculators, all citizens are heartbroken. In theory, the Price Stabilization Committee has already notified relevant banks to increase the foreign exchange for importing food and coal in November (see Reuters Hong Kong dispatch on the 30th). Subsequently, Mr. Liddell, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Mr. Minds, the American Chairman, will go to Hong Kong to consult with the Price Stabilization Committee to request more foreign exchange for essential goods. Prices should have fallen. However, they have not. From the first of this month, we have heard that food prices are rising again. If this continues, how will the vast majority of citizens survive? The authorities in the concessions have indeed put a lot of effort into dealing with prices this time; unfortunately, they are still a bit slow. Therefore, we hope that effective measures will be taken quickly and thoroughly implemented. The author also offers some humble opinions here.

Proactive Solutions

It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession convened a meeting of representatives from 35 import firms to plan the establishment of an importers' association to promote the effective implementation of the Council's special price management plan. The detailed rules have not yet been announced, so the details are unknown. Presumably, after the establishment of this association, import prices can be suppressed, and at the same time, it can at least assist the authorities in the concessions to manage prices. Therefore, we hope that it can be successfully established, and we also implore the authorities in the concessions to stand in a supervisory position and not be swayed by emotions, so that the association can fulfill the function of a price-stabilizing business. Regarding the establishment of this type of business, the "Shen Bao" economic supplement on September 22 had an article discussing it. The main points are as follows: "The establishment of a price-stabilizing business can refer to the principles of the Price Stabilization Committee, that is, when prices are raised by speculation, it should come out to buy goods to ensure that prices are at a certain level, so that there is no phenomenon of excessive profits or losses for businesses in the city."

A few days ago, the English-language "China Press" published an article suggesting the organization of a consumer association to assist the authorities in managing prices; the association should have broad powers, and if necessary, it can organize consumer cooperative enterprises, selling goods to members with only the lowest profit. This is indeed a well-intentioned method. Originally, the effect of consumer cooperation is to avoid the price increases and exploitation of merchants, and it can also regulate supply and stabilize prices. As for the success of consumer cooperation, the prerequisite is the ability to complete the consumer cooperative organization network. In other words, it must make consumer cooperatives universally distributed before it can have a great effect. Therefore, if this consumer association is established, it must be made universal. Therefore, the success of this matter depends on the leaders of the concession authorities and various public organizations, and taking more planned steps.

The above two methods can be called the most ideal and have active characteristics; but they cannot be achieved in one step. At present, prices have risen to such an extent that distant water cannot put out a fire. Urgent measures are needed.

Emergency Measures

The October price surge did not abate even in the last few days of the month, and it is still rising even higher now at the beginning of November. According to the usual reasons for price fluctuations, it is nothing more than the relationship between supply and demand and currency value. The degree of rise and fall also has a certain limit. But now it is completely different. In the past ten days or so, the black market price of gold has more than doubled, reaching 22,000 to 23,000 yuan per tael (ten taels). The prices of various goods follow gold's lead. When the price of gold rises, the prices of everything else rise with it. Logically speaking, prices and gold are unrelated, but under artificial manipulation, they insist on following it. Therefore, the authorities in the concessions should prohibit the illegal trading of gold on the black market, as has long been suggested by knowledgeable people. It is rumored that the current prohibition of cash transactions is what the Municipal Council has been discouraging. If this is true, it is a wise measure; but there are still over-the-counter cash private transactions. It is hoped that further measures will be taken to deal with this, and that personnel will be sent to monitor the yarn and flower markets. This is also an indispensable method to stop the wild rise in prices.

Secondly, the unprecedented surge in prices this time can be summed up in one word: hoarding. For example, the Price Stabilization Committee has now notified relevant banks to increase the supply of foreign exchange for food and coal. At the same time, the source of rice and coal should gradually drop its price sharply; but the price of rice is still rising, and the price of coal is jumping in the black market. Therefore, only by targeting hoarding can a severe countermeasure be taken. Hoarders can be divided into three types of people: First, the so-called unscrupulous merchants. The hoarding of unscrupulous merchants is mostly wholesalers with strong capital; at present, the hoarding of retail merchants is also very obvious. To put it another way, even if retail merchants do not hoard, it is undeniable that they are speculating. Second, people who are not merchants but see that hoarding can obtain huge profits also follow suit and purchase goods in bulk, waiting for a good price to sell. Their behavior is no different from that of unscrupulous merchants, but their capital is often above that of general retail merchants. Third, consumers with some savings, seeing that prices are soaring, have purchased and stored daily necessities in advance. This kind of behavior, although not hoarding, is still hoarding. In order to thoroughly investigate these three types of people, the authorities in the concessions may wish to select excellent patrol officers to form economic police, distribute them to various places, and investigate at any time; at the same time, citizens should cooperate with them and report any violations. If any of the above three types of people are found, they should be ordered to sell at a reasonable price and be punished according to the severity of their circumstances. Regarding this detailed handling, a police law can be formulated and promulgated.

A Powerful Backing

Again, speaking of the Price Stabilization Fund, its strength is enough to influence the Shanghai market. In the past and present, it has always provided foreign exchange for the import of essential goods. What is regrettable is that it has not been clearly stated. It was not until the end of last month that two telegrams from Hong Kong were seen; but this is not concrete. We hope that it will announce the amount of foreign exchange needed for the import of essential goods on a monthly basis, thereby dispelling the suspicions of speculators and eradicating all kinds of unfounded rumors. As for the position that the Price Stabilization Committee itself should have on prices, it is as Western economic expert An Hanneng said: "The Price Stabilization Committee has excellent reasons to insist on the following two principles: (1) The goods imported through the Price Stabilization Committee's foreign exchange settlement are not allowed to be manipulated or hoarded. These goods must be sold at the usual legitimate merchant's profit and must not be excessive; the price of new goods must be calculated according to the exchange rate stipulated by the Price Stabilization Committee, and the local inventory must be sold at the value of the new goods. (2) The goods imported through the Price Stabilization Committee's foreign exchange settlement are not allowed to be hoarded and must be sold when the market needs them. If demand exceeds supply, importers must use a sharing method to distribute the supply, taking into account the actual consumption of buyers, rather than their storage. (3) The local authorities in Shanghai should cooperate with the Price Stabilization Committee and assist in the implementation of the above two principles. In this way, the Price Stabilization Committee will be happy to provide a steady supply of foreign exchange for the import of essential goods."

Finally, if we want Shanghai's current prosperity to continue so that everyone can enjoy it, then the Chinese and foreign citizens of Shanghai should take responsibility and cooperate closely with the authorities in the concessions. It is incomprehensible that speculators want to drive prices up endlessly, so that the majority of citizens have no way out, causing Shanghai to tend towards a bad situation. If it really gets to this point, what is the use of their hoarding goods? Can they still enjoy it as they do now? We solemnly warn those who speculate and manipulate: they should look further ahead. Their situation is like a mantis seeing a cicada, with a joyful expression; how do they know that there is a bird behind the mantis! In addition, the general public should remain calm in the face of rising prices and should not easily believe rumors or rush to buy goods, creating opportunities for speculators. They should know that the current phenomenon is temporary, and the authorities will never allow prices to rise unreasonably!

### Economic History and the History of Economics

— Shen Qiyu

China's economy has always been known as backward. In recent years, many ambitious young people have gone to Europe and the United States to study economics in order to further their studies. Mr. Tang Junshu, the son of the contemporary national scholar Mr. Tang Weizhi, has a profound family background and is worthy of being the son of a general. He majored in economics in the United States and is a rare talent among China's economic experts and famous professors. He has served as a professor in various universities in China and has long been respected by the Chinese people. He is studious and thoughtful, and he is humble and amiable. He is particularly interested in the history of Chinese economic thought and has many insights. His recently compiled "Chinese Economic Thought" is the result of ten years of careful research. The first volume details the ancient Chinese economic thought and was published before the war, listed as one of the university books of the Commercial Press, a magnificent work, extremely valuable. This journal once published Mr. Zhu Tongjiu's introduction to the great work of Mr. Liu Dajun (Jitao), a famous Chinese statistical expert. Now, it is planned to introduce Mr. Tang's research conclusions on the history of Chinese economic thought to readers in succession to help domestic researchers of economics understand the changes in Chinese economic thought. ——Author's Note

People often cannot distinguish between the nature of economic history and the history of economics. Economic history is the study of the history of various systems in a certain economic society, including the origin and development of industrial, commercial, agricultural, and financial systems. The history of economics studies the development of economic science, which is different from the former. For example, British economist L. L. Price wrote "A History of Political Economy in England," and Professor W. J. Ashley wrote "Economic History of England." If readers compare the names and contents of the two books in detail, they should be able to understand the difference between economic history and the history of economics.

The importance of economic history research is now universally recognized. However, a hundred years ago, economics was still immature and not valued by scholars. In 1805, German scholars came out to oppose the classical school and created the historical school, advocating the use of historical methods to explain the principles of economics. They worked hard to study the economic history of European countries and advocated that relativism is different from absolutism. This concept is a great convenience for economic researchers and a great progress in economics. According to relativism, which includes three factors: (1) time, (2) place, and (3) environment, it is advocated that the application of economic principles must be subject to three restrictions for review. To know whether an economic theory can be applied to a certain time, place, and environment, it is necessary to study economic history. There are many famous people in this school, such as W. Roscher, G. Schmoller in Germany, and Ashley and W. Cunningham in England, who are particularly famous. Since the prevalence of the historical school's theory, people have begun to pay attention to the importance of economic history, and scholars also attach importance to the research of economic history.

All research must first collect accurate data before engaging in research. The sources of economic history data are nothing more than the following six types: (1) economic history books, (2) economic thought history books, (3) economic journals, (4) economic laws, (5) government economic reports, and (6) biographies of politicians and economists. Economic history also has close relationships with social sciences such as politics, law, society, and ethics, and those who study economic history must study them.

### Does the Price of Gold Affect Legal Tender?

— Yi Pu

The main factor for the soaring prices in Shanghai is hoarding. However, in addition to this, there are many factors that make prices expensive. One of them is the current gold gambling. This kind of gold gambling is actually a kind of "nonsense." The "chih-hsia" market is purely an artificial transaction. In fact, only 1,000 to 1,500 gold bars are in circulation, which is a very small number. Since the number of spot goods is very limited, speculators can use trading methods to cause huge fluctuations in the "chih-hsia" market price. Since the number of spot goods is limited, raising prices is not difficult. At the same time, they enter other markets to purchase goods, stocks, and bonds; as a result, prices also rise. Ordinary people on the street, seeing the "chih-hsia" soaring, think that the legal tender is falling and go to the market to buy the same goods, stocks, and bonds. These items are originally absorbed by speculators, and at this point, they spit them out, making a big profit.

This kind of cyclical situation is common, and prices are getting higher and higher. The irrationality of this matter can be seen in the following facts. The U.S. government is currently buying gold at a price of US$35 per ounce (official exchange rate), but the price in Shanghai has reached US$57 per ounce, or even more. We should solemnly point out here: this false value is purely caused by the lack of spot gold bars and the insatiable speculators doing their best to exploit the public. If the public rashly believes that this phenomenon is the result of the devaluation of the legal tender and ignores the threat of speculative nonsense, it is very unwise. We can never take the market price of "chih-hsia" in this city as the standard for the price of legal tender. Because the price of legal tender is not falling compared to the true value of gold. The "untrue" value of gold here is purely due to artificial reasons.

The public should pay attention to the manipulators rampant in various markets and should not be fooled by them. Because speculators deliberately stir up trouble, creating a chaotic situation; those who suffer are ultimately the public. The more people pay attention to the price of gold in Shanghai, the deeper they fall into the trap of speculators. Just by reviewing what has happened in the past few weeks, it is not difficult to see that speculators have created the most serious situation, harming the public and thereby enriching themselves. To seek remedy, there is only closure, and the entire society, in order to defend itself against the rampant activities of such people, should also have some potential plans. It is inconceivable that the price of legal tender in Shanghai should be greatly affected by a very small number of "chih-hsia" transactions every day.

### Marketing ABC - Pigments

— Fan Xuehui

The Darling of the European War

Foreign Merchants in Shanghai Before the outbreak of the war, Shanghai's pigment imports were around 6 million customs gold units; Germany ranked first, accounting for about 70%; followed by the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and Switzerland. The representatives they established in Shanghai:

Name in Their Own Country Representative Trading Company in Shanghai

German Daede Pigment Factory Defu Foreign Firm Manager

American Hengxin Pigment Factory Self-established Branch

American Nanxing Pigment Factory Self-established Branch

British Great Britain Pigment Factory Bunneme Foreign Firm Manager

Swiss Ciba Pigment Factory Self-established Branch

French Siemens Pigment Factory Yongxing Foreign Firm Manager

Japanese Zhaohua Pigment Factory Self-established Branch

Pigments from European countries were sold in China very early. Japan initially only had sulfide metacin. Because the manufacturing process of sulfide metacin is relatively simple. However, in the years 1926-1927, various colored dyes had come to China. It can be seen that the Japanese pigment industry was only beginning to sprout at that time.

Around 1931, Huashang Dazhong Pigment Factory was established, specializing in the manufacture of sulfide metacin. The factory was located in Longhua Town. After the outbreak of the war, Shanghai fell, and the factory was affected by the war and closed down, and it has not produced any products to this day.

Classification by Use Although there are many types of pigments, with more than a thousand brands, they can be divided into two main categories. Although there are many uses, the main ones are dyeing wool, dyeing cotton cloth, and dyeing silk. The following is an analysis according to their nature and use.

(1) Aniline (Artificial Dyes)

A Direct Dyes Direct dyes include scarlet, lake blue, black, rose red, indigo, yellow, golden yellow, brown, purple sauce, dark green, snow blue, and Tibetan blue. Their uses include dyeing cotton fabrics, hemp fabrics. Vegetable fabrics can be used. Before the arrival of non-fading pigments in China, most of China's cloth factories used this pigment. Even today, smaller cloth factories or dyeing factories in the mainland and Shanghai still use it.

B Basic Dyes Basic dyes include rose, magenta, yellow, green, golden yellow, light purple, etc. Their uses are diverse, such as dyeing rayon, paper, wood, bone, cosmetics, food coloring, and raw materials in other industries.

C Acid Dyes Acid dyes include light purple, green, yellow, Tibetan blue, rose red, red, golden yellow, pin blue, meta blue, brown, etc. Their uses include dyeing wool, silk, etc., as well as other animal and insect fabrics.

D Vat Dyes

(1) Indanthrene Made by Daede Pigment Factory

(2) Cledon Made by Great Britain Pigment Factory

(3) Cibanon Made by Ciba Pigment Factory

(4) Ponsol Made by Hengxin Pigment Factory

Vat dyes, also known as reduction dyes, have various uses that are largely the same. They are mostly used by large-scale weaving factories or dyeing factories in China and are suitable for machine dyeing. They come in various colors.

E Printing Pigments

(1) Indigosol (2) Rapidazol

These two printing pigments are produced by Daede and are divided into scarlet, purple sauce, eggplant flower, blue, green, and rose red. They are specially used for printing, such as today's cotton fabrics, bed blankets, bed sheets, and other cotton fabrics are printed with this pigment.

F Naphthol Pigments Naphthol pigments are produced by Daede: divided into scarlet, golden yellow, purple sauce, light purple, blue, rose red, yellow, etc.; in addition to dyeing, they can also be used for printing.

G Sulfurized Pigments Sulfurized pigments include meta blue, military uniform yellow, brown, and Tibetan blue. However, there are no bright colors. They are used exclusively for dyeing cotton cloth.

(2) Indigo

Indigo is a blue color and is a vat dye, with 20%, 50%, 60%, and 80% concentrations. It is sold exclusively to rural towns in China; China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and there are many farmers, so indigo has a very large market.

The selling price of indigo is calculated according to its concentration; the higher the concentration, the more expensive the selling price.

Packaging and Valuation Pigment packaging is divided into many types: such as barrels and cans. There are also large and small sizes. The following is a list of the packaging volume, the corresponding number of heavenly scales and kilograms, and the number of cans in a box during transactions:

The pigment packaging and usage are roughly like this, but there are exceptions, which cannot be fully described.

Market Center There are about forty or fifty pigment companies in Shanghai, and more than a dozen new organizations have been formed during the war. The purchasing center for pigment merchants is mostly Defu Foreign Firm; although Hengxin, Nanxing, Bunneme, etc. also have transactions, they only account for 20-30%. In the wartime Shanghai pigment market, all market price changes followed Defu's prices, so Defu Foreign Firm invisibly became the main body of Shanghai pigment transactions.

Every morning, during Defu's office hours, the street runners and managers in the pigment industry gather there; therefore, market price changes and the thickness of market inventory spread quickly throughout the market.

Local Brands and Package Brands Some pigment imports are barrel-packed, and some are can-packed. After pigment companies import barrel pigments in bulk, they repack them into small cans, label them with trademarks, and they become the so-called "local brands" in the pigment industry.

There is a type called "package brand" in the pigment industry. The method of package brand is that companies agree with the foreign firm on a certain brand of pigment and obtain the exclusive sales right due to the agreed nature; the obligation of package sales is to promote and sell the agreed amount as much as possible. If the sales volume is insufficient in one year, the package seller must pay in advance to ship the goods.

### Implementing Measures to Suppress and Stabilize Prices: Meeting to Be Held in Hong Kong; Kirkland Accompanied Industry Leaders Southbound Yesterday; Delegation's Demands to the Authorities Will Be Responded To; Industry Leaders Carry Proposals Awaiting Careful Discussion by the Stabilization Board

Kirkland, the representative of the U.S. Treasury Department who came to Shanghai on the 25th of last month to investigate the foreign exchange situation in the Shanghai market, took the Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship back to Hong Kong at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Leader, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Ming Sider, an American member of the board, also went to Hong Kong to request the Stabilization Fund to provide the foreign exchange needed for imports. Thus, they traveled on the same ship with Kirkland. The three, Kirk, Leader, and Ming, were assigned cabins No. 3, 5, and 43 in the main dining area of the ship, living next to each other, showing their close relationship. When the reporter inquired about the price issue to Dr. Ming Sider, he gave the following remarks,

The Three Have High Hopes for This Trip

(Reporter asked) Are you going to Hong Kong to present specific suggestions to the Stabilization Fund Committee? (Ming replied) There are many suggestions to be presented to the Stabilization Fund, but what the results will be and what the effect will be can only be known after careful discussion by the committee. (Asked) Can you foresee the results of the consultation with the Stabilization Fund authorities? (Answer) The hope is great. The decision to go to Hong Kong with the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Leader, to meet with the Stabilization authorities is solely for the purpose of obtaining the Stabilization Fund's sympathy for the Shanghai situation. We will explain to the Stabilization Fund the current difficulties involved. If the Stabilization Fund's sympathy can be obtained, then the future situation will naturally be optimistic. (Question) Will the Shanghai price panic be greatly improved after you and the Stabilization Fund consult? (Answer) This matter depends on public cooperation. We believe that the success of the price management plan depends on the cooperation of the people of the city. If the people are willing to pay a higher price to buy goods whose prices have been raised by speculative merchants, instead of buying goods managed and controlled by the Municipal Council, then there is little hope for improvement in the price situation. Conversely, if the public can give enthusiastic cooperation and refuse to buy goods controlled by unscrupulous merchants, then prices can obviously fall back. (Question) What kind of necessities will this trip request foreign exchange for import? (Answer) All kinds of necessities are included. (Question) How long will you stay in Hong Kong? (Answer) Undecided, roughly from one to two weeks.

Kirkland May Participate in the Meeting

According to well-informed sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council's decision to send these two senior officials to Hong Kong to meet with the Stabilization authorities in person is clearly the result of a meeting between General Manager Fei Lipu and Kirkland. As for Kirkland, after arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the Mingsheng ship on the 25th of last month, he stayed in rooms 707 and 708 of the Ducheng Hotel. During his week in Shanghai, in addition to holding talks with responsible persons from Chinese and foreign banks in this port, he also exchanged views with U.S. Consul General Lockehead and U.S. Commercial Counselor Groves, collecting various related information and materials. Then, with the completion of his public affairs, he traveled to Hong Kong yesterday with Leader, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Ming Sider, an American member of the board. He may participate in the Stabilization Meeting to be held in Hong Kong this month.

Stabilizing Prices: Both Sides Working Together

It was learned from banking circles close to Kirkland during his stay in Shanghai that Kirkland had met with responsible persons from the four major Chinese banks and representatives from foreign banks, including Mr. Hawkins of the Mercantile Bank and Mr. McCain of the Citibank. He only met them two days before his departure. It is said that Kirkland's decision to come to Shanghai was in the name of a representative of the U.S. Treasury Department, so his authority was only to solicit some opinions from relevant parties. It is reported that Kirkland's decision to return to Hong Kong will be to write a report based on the results of his investigation in Shanghai for reference by the Stabilization Fund. It is also learned that the Stabilization Fund will hold a plenary meeting in Hong Kong this month, at which Kirkland and his financial expert, Ni Meiya, will be invited to participate. It is further learned that Leader and Ming Sider, specially sent to Hong Kong by the Municipal Council, will meet with Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Stabilization Committee, Hua Dong Xi Mao Beisong Sun, and British Fei Wei Huoer Basu and Fox. As for the problem of foreign exchange and prices in Shanghai, the Stabilization Committee may have a new decision at the meeting this month because of the departure of Leader and Ming. It is also revealed by banking circles that the method that the Stabilization Fund may take to improve prices in Shanghai is to increase the supply quota for imports of necessities. However, the actual distribution must be managed by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Stabilization Fund has the right to stabilize the foreign exchange market, and the Municipal Council has the right to control prices. If the two cooperate, the problems of foreign exchange and prices in Shanghai can be solved at the same time.

The Delegation's Reply Will Be Issued Soon

According to an official of the consular corps, the consular reply to the Municipal Council's request for power to manage prices is expected to be issued on Monday. According to authoritative sources, the consular corps will undoubtedly approve the Municipal Council's request, adding that the consuls of various countries have already received the approval of their respective governments, so the formal reply can be issued on Monday or Tuesday. The general public has great hopes for the issue of Leader and Ming Sider's trip to Hong Kong and the supply of foreign exchange after negotiations with the Stabilization Fund. According to well-informed sources, the two will definitely be able to obtain more foreign exchange to supply to import merchants in this city. The Municipal Council held a special meeting the day before yesterday (31st), which lasted for two hours to discuss price management measures, but no document was issued. It is believed that a meeting will be held with import merchants next week to discuss price management measures.

### Cake and Steamed Bun Association Notice: Enduring Pain to Maintain Original Prices; Maintaining Food for the People and Fulfilling National Duty; Quietly Waiting for the Implementation of Price Management Plan

The Shanghai Cake and Steamed Bun Industry Association, because of the illegal increase in flour prices, yesterday issued another notice to its members, saying, "It has been found that in the past two weeks, flour prices have been rising sharply. After our association notified all members on the 23rd of last month that they must not increase prices without authorization, it has won the praise of all sectors. However, in the past two days, a group of hoarding flour merchants, ignoring that flour is a staple food relied upon by the common people, still hope to obtain unexpected huge profits, losing their conscience, and raising flour prices sharply to about 60 yuan per bag. Our cake and steamed bun industry, at a time when the prices of various raw materials have risen sharply, has, according to the requirements of most members, should have the need to revise prices. However, after the association has repeatedly considered the situation, it is actually different from other industries. We believe that if prices are increased, it will make life more difficult for the poor. Therefore, another notice is issued that under the current situation, we can only maintain the original prices to reduce the burden on customers, benefit the public, endure the pain of operating, uphold the principle of maintaining the people's livelihood, and fulfill our national duty. At the same time, we quietly wait for the Municipal Council's preparations for affordable flour to be supplied as soon as possible, and all the measures planned by the authorities will be implemented soon. Then, the suffering we are currently suffering will be easily solved. To sum up the above situation, we hope that all members will do their best to comply."

### Yugoslav Ship Seized; Britain Urges Japan to Pay Attention; Harbor Authorities Still Consider the Yugoslav Ship to Be

Anchored in the Huangpu River, the Yugoslav ship Tomic was forcibly occupied by the Italian marines stationed in Shanghai last Friday. Most of the crew members and sailors on the ship were forced to go ashore because they were unwilling to submit. After this case occurred, all parties paid close attention to it.

The Ship Captain Has Filed a Protest

Although the Italian side claimed that the ship had been purchased by the Italian shipping company, the fact has proven that this is a complete lie. And the fact that Italian soldiers forcibly occupied the ship is a well-known fact. It is heard that the ship's captain has filed a protest with the responsible authorities. It is learned that the British authorities in this port have also notified the Japanese naval authorities of this matter and urged them to pay attention to this kind of incident that violates Shanghai's neutral status.

There Was Another Shocking Development Yesterday

It is heard that there was another shocking development in this case yesterday. It is learned that because the Italian soldiers arbitrarily consumed almost all the stored alcohol on the ship, they asked the first mate for the key without success. They then invaded the engine room from the skylight, arbitrarily added gasoline, and attempted to start the ship, but failed. It is also reported by a crew member of the ship to the captain on shore that the Italian soldiers on the ship have left, and only a soldier of the No. Kang Tuo Fan Di and a "new captain" are still on the ship. It is learned that the ship has at least 800 tons of coal stored in its cabins. It is heard that the ship was previously leased by the Australian Wheat Company, and the stored coal belongs to the company. The ship is now in a state where it can sail at any time. According to the first mate, the Italian soldiers once asked him for the key to the engine room, but he refused. The Italian soldiers then climbed in through the skylight. The ship is now berthed in a neutral port. The customs and the authorities managing harbor affairs are the responsible authorities. Since they do not recognize the sale of the ship, the port officials still consider it to be a Yugoslav ship.

### Public Concession Police Department Annual Inspection; A Large Number of Police Officers Receive Medals

The Public Concession Police Department is scheduled to hold its annual inspection ceremony on the 5th of this month. A large number of police officers will receive medals at that time. Their names are as follows:

Chief Inspector Shi Sijian will be awarded a first-class medal. Sergeants Chen Youfang, Chinese Constables Zhao Fengjun, and Liu Baoshan will each be awarded a first-class medal. The late Chinese Constables Zhang Aifa and Yang Haibo will each be posthumously awarded a first-class medal.

### 200,000 Bags of Foreign Rice on the Way to Shanghai

According to rice industry sources yesterday, (1) A large amount of foreign rice is on the way to Shanghai, amounting to about 200,000 bags. Most of this foreign rice is Rangoon special small rice. Other rice is relatively scarce. This kind of foreign rice was commissioned by various rice merchants in the city to foreign firms a month ago, and the production price per bag is still less than 130 yuan in national currency. The cost is obviously very low. If it is transported to Shanghai and sold at the current time, a very generous additional profit can be obtained. (2) Recently, due to the repeated rise in the price of domestic and foreign rice, rice merchants are very active in handling rice, trying to transport it to the port in a short period of time and sell it on the market at the current market price. Therefore, in recent days, various foreign firms have received twice as many orders from rice merchants to purchase foreign rice as in the past. They have now telegraphed overseas one after another to negotiate purchases.

### National Father's Birthday Anniversary Approaching; Preparing for Enthusiastic Celebration; Commemorating the Great Achievements of Creating the Republic of China; Continuing to Promote Various Donation Campaigns

November 12th is the anniversary of the birth of the National Father Sun Yat-sen. Various circles in the city, because of the extraordinary times, do not intend to overdo the celebration ceremony. However, in order to commemorate the great revolutionary spirit of the Premier and the great achievements of creating the Republic of China, it was decided to follow the central government's regulations and the flag-hanging methods agreed upon by the concession authorities, and all will fly the Qing Tian Bai Ri Man Di Hong national flag for one day on that day to celebrate.

Citywide Holiday; Promoting Responsibilities

All agencies in the city

All agencies in the city, such as the two high courts, the Jianghai Customs, the post office, and various groups, schools, factories, businesses, and various industries and markets, in addition to flying flags to celebrate, will also have a holiday for the day. The post office will collect and deliver mail in accordance with the holiday methods on Sundays. Postal money orders and packages will be stopped. Other institutions such as banks and money shops will postpone the collection and settlement of silver and money until the next day. Various schools will also hold individual meetings to elaborate on the deeds and commemorative significance of the National Father. People from all walks of life have decided to continue to promote campaigns such as winter clothing money and donations for disaster relief to show their patriotism.

Concession Authorities Preparing for Alert

The police authorities of the two concessions, considering that the 12th is the National Father's birthday, are sincerely afraid that bad elements will take advantage of this opportunity to engage in illegal activities and endanger the security of the concessions. Therefore, they decided to prohibit all illegal gatherings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities from the 7th. From the 10th, they began to jointly prepare for alert, and sent additional detectives to conduct district searches and strictly enforce curfew laws. As for road bridges and traffic, it is not intended to impose a blockade.

### Impact of Factories' Ban on Transportation; Coal Consumption Gradually Decreasing; Dozens of Coal Transportation Vessels Every Month; Actual Sales in the Market Steadily Declining

Half a month ago, due to slight changes in the international situation, general speculators attempted to move again, worshiping the market by hoarding and speculating on goods. The price of smoke and white coal rose sharply in unison. Now that the international situation has gradually become clear, speculation has obviously no excuse. At the same time, various factories have also reduced production due to the impact of the ban on transportation, and the demand for coal has gradually decreased. There is a lack of interest in the spot goods in the market. Today, the coal market is showing a phenomenon of a slump. According to news from various coal industry groups, the price of smoke and white coal will soon begin to fall back.

Coal Vessel Statistics

The city's coal reserves are unusually sufficient. In addition, coal consumption has not increased during the electricity saving period. The source of supply is very smooth, and there is no fear of interruption. According to reliable sources in the shipping industry yesterday, the amount of coal transported to Shanghai last month was particularly strong. On the 3rd, the Malilyse Moller carried 1,000 tons. On the 6th, the Josephine Moller carried 1,370 tons. On the 14th, the Laos carried 1,800 tons. On the 15th, the Arianne Moller carried 650 tons. On the 17th, the Pei An carried 4,500 tons. On the 11th, the Beina Ting carried 3,000 tons. On the 13th, the Ramona carried 5,000 tons. On the 15th, the Fu Husing carried 100 tons. On the same day, the Copella carried 3,000 tons and the Tikugr Moller carried 750 tons. On the 24th, the Ariadn Moller carried 800 tons, and other ships such as the Tianlong Chuan Maru also carried no less than 4,000 tons of coal. The total is more than 25,970 tons, and other scattered amounts are not included.

### Goods Exported from Hong Kong Must Be Opened for Inspection; Executed by the Supervisor of Customs Anti-Smuggling Office

According to sources in the business community in this city yesterday, goods exported from Hong Kong, in addition to obtaining certificates, are also required to be opened for inspection, which is a very complicated procedure. The inspection methods are as follows: (1) For goods packed for export, the measurement office and the Customs Supervision Office must be notified 24 hours in advance to carry out inspection before export is allowed. (2) The loading paper must be submitted to the Customs Supervision Anti-Smuggling Office for inspection before the goods are unloaded, and stamps must be affixed. It can be released only after obtaining the following approval: (A) Exempt from inspection; (B) Released after inspection. (3) The loading paper must be submitted to the import and export office together with a statement of consent. The statement of consent must be signed by the responsible person of the exporter, proving what kind and what type of goods they are, and then approved by the tax inspector. (4) The back of the loading paper must be officially approved by the authorities and have words such as "Exempt from Inspection" or "Released after Inspection" before unloading is allowed. The procedure for inspecting goods: the inspection of export goods is carried out at the same time as the measurement official. When the measurement official is measuring the goods at the designated location, the import and export office will send a specialist to arrive and select the goods that are considered necessary to be inspected. The boxes and bags will be opened, and the owner or transporter of the goods must cooperate to assist in the work. The inspectors must pack the goods in person and affix the seal by the tax collector. All supporting documents of the exporter must be submitted to the anti-smuggling office for inspection before approval is given for release.

### Elaborating on the Theory of Education for All in the 23rd Lecture of the Five Societies

(Continued) It was also pointed out that Guan Gong was a devout believer. The Chaldean history states, "The Gospel was first spread in China by the power of St. Thomas." According to the history of missionaries in China, "Achaeus of the Majun Sect in the 5th century, Nestorian Silas in the 6th century, and Salila-Zacha in the 8th century had already established Chinese dioceses." "In the 7th century, the revised Syriac breviary mentioned China, and the Chinese people could speak Syriac, so it must be one of the twelve apostles. At the beginning of the 10th century, Nestorian Patriarch Ebedjesus, in accordance with the will of Yahballaha III, who grew up in China, associated with the Thomas sect." Therefore, the book "Chinese Christians in the 16th Century" refutes the above theories as late fabrications. In the 17th century, during the fifth year of the reign of Emperor Xizong of the Ming Dynasty (Tianqi), a stele of the popular Nestorianism written by Yijingjing during the second year of the reign of Emperor Dezong of the Tang Dynasty (Jianzhong) was unearthed in Xi'an. It was also written in Syriac and referred to "Emperor Taizong's decree to welcome the virtuous Alopen from Great Qin in the twelfth year of his reign," as seen by the Italian priest Giuleo Aleni. In the appendix of Western Studies, Li Zhizao used the Nestorian stele to prove the doctrines of Christianity. Wang Pu's "Tang Huiyao" said, "The Persian monk Alopen." The Zhenyuan Buddhist Records stated, "The Persian monk Jingjing from the Great Qin Temple should preach the Mishihe (Messiah) religion." The Tang Dynasty Book Wuzong Ji mentioned "Da Qin Mu Hu Ao." The History of Religious Thought pointed out that these were all Christians. Yao Kuan's "Xixi Conghua" and Qian Qianyi's "Jingjiao Kao" considered the Persian Da Qin Manichaean religion as one source. Hang Shijun's "Jingjiao Xu Kao" quoted ancient Arabian history to prove that it was Islam. Qian Daxin's "Jinshiwen Ba" and Wang Chang's "Jinshi Cuibian" also mentioned it. Someone said, "The inscription says 'Shizi Yongzhuang' and 'Lv Xiuyan wrote it', implying Xuanzang and Lv Yan, suspecting that it must be a Ming Dynasty forgery."

During the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, the World-Honored One's Discourse on Charity and Praise of the Three Majesties, and other texts were discovered in the Dunhuang Stone Chamber. Japan's Haneda Toru collected the Listening Mystery Poem Sutra, and Li Shengduo obtained the Zhiyuan Anle Sutra. The Xuanyuan Zhiben Sutra states that missionary history says Alopen was a Nestorian disciple. During the European Crusades in the 13th century, the Roman Pope obtained the support of the Yuan Dynasty. When Emperor Shizu ascended the throne, Christianity was spread to China along with it. Marco Polo's Travels mentioned that Zhaizhao sent envoys to the Pope to recruit highly knowledgeable priests and obtain lamp oil from Jesus' tomb, etc. Qing Hongjun's "Translation and Supplement to the Yuan History" proves that "Yelike Weng was a Catholic," which is also mentioned in Dosang Xuliegu's biography, "The Mongols called Catholicism Aleke Weng," which was under the jurisdiction of the Chongfu Si, along with the Buddhist Xuanzheng Yuan, and the Daoist Ji Shen Yuan. Liang Xiangji mentioned, "The commander-in-chief of Zhenjiang built seven temples." Yu Yue's preface to Yang Wenjie's "Dongcheng Ji Yu" states, "The Dapuxing Temple enshrines the Yelike Weng religion," which is the same as the Nestorianism stele's saying of "judging the four directions with the cross." The missionary records and canons of the 16th century state, "The Buddhist temples in Jiangnan were transformed from the Fanghui Seminary." The magazine states, "Tibetan Lamaism and Nestorianism have the same origin," as evidence of the submergence of ancient Christianity in China. During the reign of Emperor Chengzong of the Yuan Dynasty, the Holy See sent the Italian Franciscan Giovanni Montecorvion to Shangdu. At the beginning of the 14th century, he was appointed Archbishop and founded the Chinese missionary district. In a letter to Europe, he said, "The apostles or their descendants came to China from He."

According to missionary records, the first person to be approved for missionary work was the Portuguese Jesuit Melichior Nuncz Barrato in the 16th century. Saint Francis Xavier died on Shangchuan Island before he could come to China. Three years later, he finally arrived in Macau. His diary also states, "China has never heard of the Gospel or the descent of God into the world." Later, Martino de Her Rada of the Augustinian order stayed in Fujian for more than a month, collecting hundreds of books to study the internal affairs of China and created Chinese linguistics. Don Phlippe of the Bandxiong Association sent a letter to the Chinese Emperor, offering precious tributes, as seen in the missionary records. Alexandre Valiguani, an Italian Jesuit priest, knew that missionary work in China was not easy and must have a planned approach to adapt to China, reformed the old methods of missionary work, selected capable people, first studied Chinese etiquette, language, and writing, and used them for preaching. Michele Ruggieri was kind and good at socializing. Western scholars were completely sinicized. He first built the Church of the Holy Mother, provided a statue of the Holy Mother, and used Chinese to describe the precious records of God. It was printed and published in the twelfth year of Wanli. Chen Rui, the governor of Guangdong, inspected Macau. Bishop Don Leonardo de Sao of Rodesa Chen said that foreign residents sought refuge and were originally obedient subjects of the Chinese court. He also wrote in a letter, "Risking the heavy seas, admiring the Celestial Dynasty, willing to be listed as subjects, and changing to monastic garb." Four monks detailed their diaries. His assistant Matteo Ricci followed Fan's instructions, wore Confucian robes, and used Chinese classics to prove religious doctrines. He used lectures to associate with scholars and officials. Those who were baptized included Xu Guangqi, whose baptismal name was Dalv, Qu Ruji, whose baptismal name was Najue, and Li Zhizao, whose baptismal name was Liang, laying the foundation for missionary work in China. He died and was buried by Emperor Shenzong. At the beginning of the 17th century, Western Jesuit scholars all followed the correct calendar. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the German Joannes Adam Schall Von Bell was given the title of Tongwei Teacher. During the Kangxi period, this person, Ferdinandus Raux, and the Portuguese Joesph Riberio and Verissimo Monterio de Serra, were all astronomical officials from the West. It was not until the seventeenth year of Daoguang and the twenty-fourth year of Kangzhao that Luo Wenzao of the Dominican Order became the first Chinese bishop. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Archbishop Mgr. Ceiso Costantinl Archbishop of Theodosia came to China. He examined the four fourth year thirty-first year, three times Ephesus meetings, re-emphasizing Jesus' divinity as orthodox, and considering the Nestorianism of the human nature as heresy, which later became the Persian sect. In 1054, those who separated from the Roman Church in the West became the Greek sect. In 1517, the German Luther reformed the old Catholic Church and created the new religion, which became the Lutheran Church. In the twelfth year of Jiaqing, the Englishman Morrison came to China to preach the new religion. According to the Chinese translation of the Bible by the London Society, by the twenty-fourth year, the Chinese-English dictionary was compiled by the China Christian Church, the Sheng Gong Hui, the Congregational Church, and the Baptist Church. To this day, the various denominations of Protestantism, such as the China Christian Church, the Sheng Gong Hui, the Congregational Church, the Baptist Church, the Lutheran Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Inland Mission, and the Methodist Episcopal Church, are all over China.

### Shanghai Prostitutes (4)

— Translated by Kequn

The high-class foreign brothels in Shanghai are all registered with the Public Works Bureau as "boarders." There are only five or six such demon dens in Shanghai. The average price of women in these places is around 50 yuan. If a customer wants to drink in such a brothel, he must also buy wine to give to all the other women in the brothel. In this way, one drink usually costs 50 yuan. In reality, these women don't really drink, but only drink some ginger ale.

According to a foreign teacher who told the reporter: The women here all have a good understanding of hygiene. If they have a disease, they usually take a break from work until they are cured by a doctor. Although in a few cases, they are forced to continue working by the brothel owner even if they are already ill, but even if they are ill, because they have a good knowledge of hygiene, the chance of being infected with the disease by having a relationship with them is rare.

The brothel owners treat the women in these brothels very well. Many old foreign women can use this to become a little rich and accumulate a small amount of wealth immediately. These prostitutes only receive a few customers per night. Some of them are already addicted to drugs. The nationalities of these prostitutes are mostly Russian. There are also British, American, and Scandinavian women mixed in. There are also a few prostitutes who are German Jews.

The process by which these prostitutes fall into this business is generally that they initially stay in Shanghai for various other reasons and work as waitresses in bars. The working hours in the bars are very long, and their work is erotic. Therefore, when a representative from a high-class brothel lures them with benefits and tells them, "If you want to go there, you can get more money, and the method is very easy." Under these circumstances, after listening to the sweet words, how can they not yearn for it, and finally fall into their trap. After they fall into the brothel, they feel that life is easier, so they settle down and start this new life. When they feel tired at night, someone will offer them strong opium to relieve their fatigue. After this stimulant, their spirits are revived and they return to happiness. Later, if they feel tired again, they still have strong opium to relieve them. After a few weeks, they become addicted. This is the general life situation of prostitutes in the foreign gold-digging dens in Shanghai. However, there are also many people who live a slightly more serious life, so there are still a few women whose living conditions are better, not as decadent as described above. They save a small amount of money to prepare to leave Shanghai or to start other normal businesses.

There are more than a dozen brothels in Shanghai where the cost is slightly cheaper than the high-class brothels described above. These brothels all have very eye-catching and appropriate names marked at their entrances. The women in these brothels are all Russian and Korean. Their prices range from 30 to 50 yuan.

There is also a type of noble prostitute in Shanghai who seems to be a woman from a good family and privately engages in this business. Their purpose is nothing more than to earn money for personal enjoyment. Those who visit this type of brothel must have a guide who knows the way to introduce them before they can enter. Upon entering, a solemn middle-aged woman comes out to greet them, serving tea to the guests. After she asks about the visitor's identity, status, and economic situation, if she is satisfied, she will immediately ask the guest what type of woman they like, tall or small? Fat or thin? Let the guest decide. After the guest chooses the type of woman they want, she will contact them and summon them. As a rule, the women do not immediately enter the guest room after being summoned. They first look into the room through a small window on the door to see if they know the customer in the room. If the person is someone they know, they will not enter the room. The women here usually only allow one meeting, and the price for one night ranges from 200 to 1,000 yuan. In addition, customers often have expensive clothes made for them.

According to a Chinese venereologist, many wealthy Chinese men have contracted serious diseases from these women. Similarly, many women have also been infected with serious diseases through the solicitation of these places, under the principle of having fun and earning pocket money in one fell swoop.

There are also hundreds of "Western private prostitutes" in Shanghai who engage in prostitution. They often publish advertisements in the newspapers for "manicure girls" or "massage girls." Although the police authorities have repeatedly tried to ban their activities and have asked the local English newspapers to investigate the authenticity of such advertisements before they are published, otherwise they will not be published, they are still very active in the market. They are mostly Russian women. Their friends encourage each other and say that they can go to visit at a certain time and achieve certain goals. Their fees range from 10 to 100 yuan. These prostitutes certainly cannot stay clean for a long time, because one customer often visits them for a day and night before leaving, and another customer comes right after. As a result, they spread venereal diseases among the male Caucasians in Shanghai, making the doctors in Shanghai forever busy diagnosing and treating diseases.

### Extortion by Intimidation, Convicted and Punished, Hand-Pulled Grenade and Letters Confiscated

Yu Youqing, a wealthy gentry from Songjiang, residing at No. 5, Lane 688, Tonghe Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, received five consecutive threatening letters from September 14th to the 17th of last month, along with a grenade, extorting 5,000 yuan in legal tender from him, otherwise the lives of his entire family would be in their hands. After receiving the grenade, he was terrified and reported it to the Xinza Gate Patrol Station in charge, which sent detectives disguised as tea attendants and requested assistance from the French patrol station to follow the designated location to Room 215 of the Gongping Hotel at No. 291 Edward Road and No. 150 Caishi Street to arrest the extortionists Gu Caifa and Yin Guilin, and seized the 5,000 yuan in stolen money that the defendants had already accepted, and sent them to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court for prosecution according to law. The defendants confessed that the initiator of the crime was Wang Bingyi, who was at large, because Wang's mother worked as a maid in the victim's home and was very clear about the victim's economic situation, and that the two of them were in a passive position. The court ordered them to be returned to custody. The sentence was pronounced the day before yesterday by Judge Shi presiding over the Second Criminal Court, Gu Caifa was sentenced to one year for attempted extortion by intimidation, Yin Guilin was sentenced to five months imprisonment, and five threatening letters and a hand-pulled grenade were confiscated.

Exchanging Ball Bases

Jia Youliang and Qu Xilin dismounted with majesty, and Wang Nan of Blue and White made contributions again, becoming 19 to 18. Qu Xilin's ball luck was good, and all three remote shots were in the net. Blue and White began to pull back two points by Zhang Jinshuan. Wang Jinhu of Paramount fouled, and Nan took the initiative, scoring a hit with one throw, tying the score at 24 each, evenly matched. It can be imagined that it was difficult for each other to separate, and the situation was tense. Both sides were careful. With five minutes to go, Zhang Shaoqing of Paramount got the pass from Jia Youliang and shot next to him. Chen Bangzhen of Blue and White fouled the ball, and Shaoqing scored with one throw, taking the lead with 25 to 24. With seconds to go until the end, Wang Nan had a great opportunity. Qu Jinlin of Paramount desperately blocked the ball, tripping Li Zude of Blue and White, and was ruled a foul. Time ran out, Zude took the penalty, but unfortunately, the ball luck was not good, and the one ball of life and death failed to hit, and Paramount won the championship with 25 to 24 over Blue and White.

### Daylight Saving Time Canceled

— Yi

Starting from midnight on November 1st, daylight saving time is canceled. This morning, many families are hoping to sleep an extra hour because husbands or working women can leave for the office an hour later.

In fact, getting up early is very important in the family. If you can get up early every day, many household chores can be done more smoothly, allowing the housewife to be calm and organized.

Some housewives (we hope this number is not large) do not pay attention to time at all. They sleep very late and get up very late. Buying groceries and cooking are all done by the maid. These people's families will definitely not be healthy.

Many husbands also do not keep time. They cannot come home for dinner on time, causing the children to fall asleep while waiting. Many family quarrels are caused by husbands not keeping time.

I believe that if we can fully utilize all the time we have in our lives, and every minute we spend doing something meaningful, and every minute that passes brings us joy, then life will be more meaningful and more beautiful.

My Family Problems

### I Fear Marriage

— Zhenzi

Because of physiological needs and years of wandering, I need marriage to comfort me.

Marriage is sweet, but every time I think about marriage and the situation after marriage, a gloomy atmosphere drives away the sweetness; thus, it has become my fear of marriage.

Am I not satisfied with my partner? No, although she is not an outstanding woman, she is very suitable for me. She is two years younger than me and has a junior high school education. She is not a member of the progressive professional women's circle; on the contrary, she is a skilled cook in the kitchen! Although she cannot be economically independent, I cannot say that she is my appendage. Even if she goes to work in society, the gains and losses may not be commensurate, so I don't resent her being backward.

Marriage expenses, living expenses, children's education expenses... a series of them hit my heart. In this unreasonable and abnormally developing society, economic problems have almost become the greatest hardship for every salaried class and an important factor in the general fear of marriage. Why should I elaborate further? Some people say, isn't a poor and humble couple more meaningful than a marriage under consumerism! This may be an ideal that can become a reality, I pray for it.

However, in any case, it cannot eliminate my fear of marriage. The reason is that my career is simply not suitable for marriage. It will shatter a happy marriage into pieces, not to mention that our marriage does not have a significant advantage in other conditions, how can it withstand this ruthless palm blow?

I am a factory worker in a yarn factory. The machinery in the yarn factory runs day and night. People are not machines after all and must work in two shifts. The day shift is from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., and the night shift is from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. the next morning. Adding in meals, walking, bowel movements, and other private matters, it takes a full 15 hours. There is not enough time left for sleep. Even if there is infinite happiness in the family, how can I enjoy it? Moreover, the day and night shifts rotate every week. When working the day shift, I have to go to the factory at four or five o'clock in the morning, "letting down the fragrant quilt," as the predecessors have done. I dare not say more. But when I am constantly working the night shift, "resting at sunrise," am I supposed to ask my wife to live this upside-down life with me?

Love is like the seed of a plant. It can grow in a suitable environment and can also be destroyed by storms.

I fear the arrival of this unfortunate fact. I fear marriage! (Payment of ten yuan for family monthly publications)

Editor's Note: Regarding Mr. Zhen's reasons for fearing marriage, I think the economic problem is more important. Because changing shifts and "working at sunrise" and "resting at sunset" is not a very serious problem. Are all the families of newspaper reporters unhappy? Marriage is an art, it all depends on how the parties involved handle it. The reversal of time will not affect the feelings of the couple.

I believe that a person with a job should engage in self-cultivation and enrich themselves, because economic problems can only be solved reasonably through hard work. Please don't say you don't have time. Even if you spend 15 minutes a day reading a book, you can have considerable results after a year.

If Mr. Zhenzi is under thirty years old, then it is okay to wait for some time.

### Safety First

— Jing

Many accidents in the home can be avoided. Here are twenty incidents that can be easily prevented. Prevent accidents from happening

Don't use boxes or boxes as ladders, it is very dangerous to stand on them.

Don't put toys or other things randomly on the stairs.

Don't put carpets on floors that are too slippery.

If the windows are too low, they should be protected with wire or railings.

Don't put matches where children can reach them.

Don't leave the pot handles facing outward when putting pots on the stove.

Don't use kerosene or other flammable substances as cleaning products.

Protective equipment should be installed next to the stove.

Don't smoke in bed.

Don't touch electrical objects with wet hands.

Don't leave children in the bathtub alone while you go outside the room.

Don't allow children to touch knives or other sharp objects.

Don't let children run around with sharp objects on them.

Don't leave used medicine casually.

Don't put disinfectant or insecticide where children can reach them.

Don't leave waste paper scattered around, it should be organized.

### How to Treat a Cold?

— Li

In this weather that is constantly changing, it is easiest to catch a cold, so the prevention and treatment of colds are really urgent. If you have already been attacked by a cold, then the first thing to do is to keep your throat and chest warm. A light and soft scarf is a good idea. Rinse your mouth with cold water once or twice a day, adding half a teaspoon of salt to a glass of cold water, because cold water can increase the resistance of the mucous membrane, and salt has antibacterial and disinfectant effects.

Sunlight is also an element that helps increase resistance, so you should breathe a lot of fresh air and enjoy a lot of sunlight every day. On average, we drink too little water every day. Drinking eight glasses of boiled water a day is very appropriate and can help the body eliminate toxins.

According to medical research, worries and overwork are one of the causes of colds, so to prevent colds, you must not overwork every day and need to have eight hours of adequate sleep. But if there is a fever or sore throat, then you should see a doctor.

### One Experience in Housework

— Zhu Xun

When polishing leather shoes, adding one or two drops of vinegar or acetic acid to the shoe polish can make the shoes shine more brightly and last longer. Lemon juice contains bone-dissolving oxygen, so when eating fish, if a fish bone gets stuck in your throat, swallowing lemon juice will dissolve it. If you don't have lemons, you can buy citric acid from the drugstore and dissolve it.

If you bury eggs in a wooden box containing salt, with several holes at the bottom of the box covered with thick paper, they can be preserved for a long time. If you rub lemon juice on your face before applying face powder, it can make your skin more tender, cleaner, and softer. If you use milk instead, it has the same effect. If you mix a small spoonful of glycerin into ten times the amount of water and pour it into the bathtub when bathing, you will feel exceptionally comfortable when bathing and can relieve fatigue and hardship.

If the skin is burned or the hands, feet, or face are cracked, you can apply glycerin to the cracked areas to heal quickly.

Pomelo pits should not be discarded. If you soak them in boiling water, they can replace hair cream, and they are rich in viscosity and have a smooth and moisturizing texture. Frequent use on hair can make the hair black and shiny.

### One Week of Everyday Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

For the past month, the so-called crab of the "intestine-less gentleman" has been the most talked-about thing in Shanghai. Almost every important street has one or two crab stalls. Even though each crab the size of a bowl costs as much as four or five yuan, wealthy gentlemen and ladies come to buy them. However, we salaried people do not have the luck to eat them. Personally, I don't have much fondness for the so-called big hairy crab. Instead of peeling the crab meat and dipping it in vinegar and ginger, stir-fried crab roe is more flavorful and also more economical. For example, eating a big hairy crab costs at least two or three yuan per crab. Small ones are not worth eating. But eating stir-fried crab roe, two small crabs for one yuan can also be peeled. If you spend one yuan to buy two small crabs, peel them to get a shallow bowl of crab roe, and then add some egg flowers and chives, you can divide it into two bowls for the needs of two meals, day and night. Therefore, from an economic standpoint, I advocate eating stir-fried crab roe and do not advocate eating big steamed crabs.

Monday: Celery stir-fried with shredded pork, sweet and sour pan-fried ribbonfish, spinach and sweet potato soup, braised radish slices

Tuesday: Onion stir-fried with shredded beef, stir-fried small shrimp, green vegetables stir-fried with glass noodles, vegetarian tofu soup

Wednesday: Preserved mustard greens stir-fried with diced pork belly, meatloaf stewed with turtles, raw golden flower vegetables, green onion fermented soybean paste

Thursday: Tomato beef soup, fish head with bean curd sheets, spinach braised with tofu, celery mixed with sesame sauce

Friday: Green flower braised meat balls, vinegar-glazed yellow croaker fillets, preserved mustard greens with soybean sprouts, vegetarian dishes with fried fermented soybeans

Saturday: Silver sprouts stir-fried with shredded chicken, tomato braised crucian carp, braised cabbage, jellyfish and radish shreds

Sunday: Curry meat, stir-fried crab roe, vegetarian ten-treasure dish, mixed artemisia

Tianchu Recipe (79)

### (143) Crab Meat Lion Head Meatballs

— Draft by Sun Mingjing

Ingredients: Crab, fresh meat, cooking wine, soy sauce, salt, sugar, green onion, lard, cooking oil, ginger, MSG, green vegetables, refined white water chestnut flour. Preparation: First, cook the crab thoroughly, remove the shell, take the meat, chop it together with the fresh meat, add a little water chestnut flour, mix with an appropriate amount of chopped green onion, minced ginger, MSG, cooking wine, fine salt, white sugar, etc., make it into a ball shape, put it into a pot of boiling lard and fry it repeatedly until it turns golden brown, then take it out. Then, stir-fry the washed green vegetables with cooking oil, then put the fried crab meat balls on top of the vegetables and braise them until the vegetables are tender and cooked. Answering Ms. Lu Liqing's question about "Long-term crab storage method":

"Round navel in September, pointed in October," the current time is the best season for eating crabs. But if you store the crabs until the cold winter and cook them, then "holding them while appreciating the snow" also feels like a different kind of enjoyment. The method is to select plump crabs in September and October, store them in jars, use mud to build some embankments inside the jars, and then spread loose mud on the bottom, filling it with water to about half, so that the crabs are in the middle, as if living in a cave. Wait until three days before eating, remove all the water in the container, grind black sesame seeds into a fine powder, mix them into the mud, and separate them from the crab layer. Cover the mouth of the jar with a board so that the crabs cannot move. Take them out and steam them three days later, the flavor and robustness are comparable, but feeding them should not be done too early, otherwise, there is a risk of death.

Everyone: If you want to buy "MSG", "Tianchu Soy Sauce Extract", and oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, please dial 144594, a special messenger will deliver it immediately, without charging delivery fees.

Spring and Autumn

### Willing to Go Backwards

— Wuwei

What an unambitious statement – willing to go backwards! As the saying goes: When people are poor, their spirits are low, and low means shrinking. Generally speaking, when individuals have no other options, their ambitions may "shrink."

Shanghai people also have a local saying called: "Living alive and shrinking back," meaning that although a person's age increases, all thoughts and actions are only moving backward, out of date, and without any progress.

Who wants to "go backwards"? Who wants to "retreat"? But in this era of skyrocketing prices and extremely difficult living conditions, we look back to the past and reminisce about the past, feeling that we want to "go backwards" but cannot!

The day before yesterday at midnight, everyone turned back the clock by one hour, and summer time bid farewell from then on. If we could extend this further, with everyone going backwards from this one hour, one day, one week, one month, and honestly "living alive and shrinking back," wouldn't that be wonderful?

Saturday (1st): Kunshan new indica rice was 198 yuan per picul; going backwards one day, Friday, it was 191 yuan per picul; going backwards one week (October 26th), it was 179 yuan per picul; going backwards one month (October 10th), it was only 150 yuan per picul.

I ask, in terms of living, who among the citizens of Shanghai is unwilling to go backwards!

We are speaking out for the salaried class, hoping that those self-proclaimed "progressive people," quick-witted, hoarding, and speculating gentlemen, will consider the many "backward" small citizens of Shanghai and temporarily become "outdated people"!

In the Circle of Life

### Rescuing the People from Fire and Water at the Cost of Sacrifice: The Work of Firefighters

— Gengyun

"Neither like a copyist, nor like a firefighter," the status of a "fire ghost" in the minds of most people can be imagined in these two idioms! The fire department is also known as the fire brigade. People who work here should be called firefighters or firemen. However, people just don't call them that, but instead bestow the epithet "ghost." "Ghost" means a spirit, something isolated from mankind.

The work of a "fire ghost" is not as simple as people imagine, just putting out fires. They are also considered a batch of coolies on standby in the fire department. The fire truck is equipped with no less than hundreds of fire extinguishing equipment, large and small parts. Every day, these equipment and parts must be disassembled one by one and wiped clean with gasoline and yellow sand, making them shine brightly. Washing cars, washing floors, washing doors and windows, washing belts, all the sporadic and heavy work, there is nothing that the "fire ghosts" do not do. From morning to night, they work hard and rarely have free time. If you want to touch their hands, look! They are so rough and dry that they are simply like tree bark.

When the fire alarm bell rings clang clang, no matter in the daytime, at night, in the sweltering heat, or in the severe winter, dropping everything, they don't have time to run up the stairs, so they slide down the evacuation pillar (a vertical copper pillar that runs from the top floor to the bottom floor. To act quickly in case of fire, every firefighter holds onto this pillar and slides down), and climb onto the fire truck as if flying. The truck must leave the gate within five minutes of receiving the fire alarm report. Can it be done without being quick and agile?

Fighting a fire is like fighting against the enemy, charging into battle. Holding fire hooks and axes, and with the nozzle, they rush into the thick smoke and flames, into the fire pit. Who knows if flying bricks will crack open their heads or broken walls will break their legs, but they are not afraid to sacrifice! For the sake of protecting people's property and lives!

The word "freedom" seems to have lost its meaning in the fire department. Except for one day a week for "reporting for duty" (going out), they are not allowed to leave the fire station even one step from day to night. No matter how big the matter is, you are not allowed to go out until this day. If you "poke a hole in the skin" (go out privately), once discovered, you will be treated to a merciless "big meal" (severe punishment), alienated from relatives and friends, and rarely meet with your beloved wife.

For some reason, it is becoming more and more difficult to make money in Shanghai, the harder you work. "Fire ghosts" are certainly no exception. But their work is ultimately great in the social sense. "Rescuing the people from fire and water," don't underestimate them! (Payment)

### Incurable by Famous Doctors

— Qian

Patient: Merciful doctor! For years, I have had dizziness and headaches, weak limbs, and lack of energy. Is there any special medicine to cure my illness?

Famous Doctor: (Pressing the pulse, observing the complexion) The five internal organs are not diseased, just a little lack of nutrition.

Patient: (Eagerly) Doctor! What should I do?

Famous Doctor: Not difficult! Not difficult! (Picking up the pen and writing a prescription, in one fell swoop:)

"Family Fortune Pot One

Vegetable Heart Meat Slice Pot One

Vinegar Glazed Yellow Croaker One

Three Fresh Soup Bowl One

Take two doses a day, guaranteed to be cured after ten days."

Patient: (Amazed) Ah! The monthly salary of one hundred and ten yuan is not enough to cover the food expenses of two adults and three children. How can I afford these twenty doses of expensive medicine! Famous Doctor: Hmm! This, this…………

### One Cent?

— Ye Jiale

Eldest Brother: Father left a total of 100,000 yuan in cash. Let's divide it equally!

Second Brother: Good! Each person can get 33,333 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen. Then what about the remaining one cent? Third Brother: I think this one cent should be donated to a charity.

### The Boundary Between Boss and Employee

— Shan Xiao

The night before last, a relative who works as a small clerk in a ×× company came to see me. As soon as he sat down, he talked about how the cost of living is so high, how can ordinary salaried people survive? It is especially difficult for him with his forty or fifty yuan salary: clothing, pocket money... and his wife at home often writes letters to urge him for money. Every month, he always runs a deficit. But if he had some capital, he wouldn't be in such a difficult situation now. This spring, he had persuaded a wealthy friend of his to buy a share of his company's stock. However, that friend calculated it and said: It's not worthwhile, because depositing in the bank also has a four or five percent interest rate, and it's also safe. But he was willing to subsidize his friend up to one and a half points, because the stock was in my relative's name, and at the end of the year, he could get a larger bonus because of this. However, that wealthy friend said: His company specializes in selling foreign goods. In the future, if the shipping routes are completely cut off, there will be nothing to sell. If there is nothing to sell, is the stock still worth anything? Besides, you can make money on anything now, why buy this dull stock?

My relative continued in frustration: If his friend had listened to him at the time, the stock that was previously worth 2,000 yuan would now be worth more than 3,000 yuan, and he would have received a few thousand yuan less in dividends at the end of the year. But he didn't listen to him, so he complained about his bad luck.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

The Life of Beating Out a Hero

"Of course, it's all very disheartening. Although Xiao Jiqing is a theater owner, he's actually quite kind-hearted. Knowing that telling Begonia directly would be very embarrassing, he deliberately beat around the bush. "However, as the saying goes, a great man can bend and stretch. If Boss Wu can understand the current situation, then I can honestly tell you.""

Hearing these words, Qian Ruomo knew that things were not good, but Begonia still tried his best to be patient.

"Mr. Xiao is right, as long as you are willing to give me food, I will do anything!"

"Let me talk about the stage first. In the official orchestra, the people are already complete! But if you force to add someone to beat the large gong or small gong, it is possible, but the salary is very low, only two to four yuan per month." Xiao Jiqing's words here made Begonia and Qian Ruomo's hearts grow cold simultaneously. "But according to that martial arts leader, a subordinate recently left the martial arts troupe; Boss Wu is also from a professional opera school, so he probably still knows how to do some tumbling and fighting. Their share will be larger than the stage. With my and Mr. Qian's connections, of course, we can offer better treatment than others; if you can be a subordinate, you can get forty-two yuan a month. If you can only be a superior, then thirty-four yuan is guaranteed, but…." (252)
