### US Lend-Lease Bill Passes Senate: Part Used to Expand China's Air Force; Some Chinese Recall Arriving in US for Flight Training; Hu Shih Expresses Willingness to Prioritize US Aircraft for Soviet Aid

United International News, Washington, 24th: The new Lend-Lease appropriation bill passed the Senate yesterday evening after less than a day of debate. The bill allocates $5,985,000,000 worth of military supplies to aid China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The bill has now been returned to the House for final revisions and will soon be signed by President Roosevelt. China's share totals $133,000,000, which will be used to purchase warplanes to strengthen China's air force.

United Press, Washington, 24th: Army Chief of Staff Colonel Stimson announced yesterday that six Royal Air Force pilots, experienced in combat, will join the US Air Force to exchange technical knowledge with American pilots. He also announced that a group of Chinese has arrived to receive training in the US Army as pilots and mechanics. This training is possibly funded by Lend-Lease.

United Press, Washington, 24th: Army Chief of Staff Stimson stated that he has not heard of any Anglo-American agreement guaranteeing the status quo in the Far East against aggression.

International News, Melbourne, 24th: British Eastern Army Commander-in-Chief Sir Thomas Blamey stated here today that the position of democratic countries in the Far East is quite solid. Blamey told visitors that Allied defenses are much stronger than several months ago. Mr. Blamey made this statement based on the recent Malaya-Dutch East Indies-Philippines conference. During the past week, Mr. Blamey attended meetings of the Australian War Cabinet to discuss joint defense strategies in the event of war in the Pacific.

International News, Pittsburgh, 24th: Chinese Ambassador to the US Dr. Hu Shih stated here yesterday in a speech, "The United States can prioritize sending bombers to the Soviet Union's urgent front lines. China can wait. China can still fight Japan with its existing weapons. The Soviet Union needs them more urgently, so China should temporarily yield." However, Hu quickly emphasized that this does not mean China does not need American bombers, only that after years of resolute resistance against Japan, the war situation is gradually turning in China's favor.

This is a Natural Result of the War; German and Japanese Rumors are Not Accurate

Chongqing: Official sources here announced today that they are not aware of any notification from the Soviet Union stating that they cannot continue to supply goods to the Chinese government. (The news of the Soviet notification came from Tokyo and Berlin). Officials stated that this news is not true. They stated that since the start of the German-Soviet war, supplies from the Soviet Union have decreased, but this decrease should be considered a natural result of the German-Soviet war.

### Japanese Retreating Towards Zhengzhou; Chinese Forces Recapture Guangwu City; Fierce Fighting in Hao Xue Area; Japanese Retreating South on Yuehan Railway; Chinese Forces Preparing to Attack Guangzhou

Luoyang: At 2 PM on the 23rd, Chinese forces recaptured Guangwu City. The Japanese are retreating towards Zhengzhou and the old Xingze Dingwangdian and other places. (23rd dispatch)

Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesperson stated that the Japanese are currently deploying fresh troops to the junction of the Pinghan Railway and the Longhai Railway, seemingly planning a new offensive in the Zhengzhou area. The fighting is currently taking place northeast of Rongyang on the Longhai Railway on the south bank of the Yellow River. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Changde: Chinese forces on the north bank engaged in intense hand-to-hand combat with the invading Japanese from Hao Xue Sheqiao to Baimasi line throughout the 22nd. The Chinese and Japanese are still fighting fiercely in the vicinity of these locations. In addition, Japanese planes have been constantly flying to various riverside locations on the north bank to conduct reconnaissance in the past three days. (23rd dispatch)

Hong Kong: According to news received here from Shaoguan, after the Japanese army retreated south along the Yuehan Railway and the North River, 20,000 Japanese soldiers are now concentrated in the Guangzhou area for a short period of rest. Japanese Southern China Army Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Imamura has also returned to Guangzhou to convene a military conference to decide on future actions. It is reported that many wounded Japanese soldiers from the Conghua Huaxian area have been transported to Guangzhou. It is estimated that the number of Japanese casualties from September 20 to 30 was approximately 750. It is also reported that the Japanese army is currently engaged in mopping-up operations near Guangzhou. However, according to the Chinese side, Chinese forces are now preparing to take action against Guangzhou. The news that the Chinese army is about to take action can be seen from Chiang Kuang-nai's arrival at a certain location in the West River Delta. Chiang was formerly the commander-in-chief of the 19th Route Army and drafted the defense plans for the two repulsions of the Japanese invasion of Shaoguan. After the Japanese army retreated south, the threat to Shaoguan has been removed. Their only concern is the Japanese paratroopers. The Shaoguan Command has offered a large reward; anyone who captures a Japanese paratrooper will be rewarded with 200 to 2,000 yuan. (24th International News dispatch)

### Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Officially Announces Government Moved to Samara City; Defense of Capital Intensified; Moscow Subjected to Heavy Bombing by German Aircraft

TASS, Kuybyshev, 24th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Deputy Director of the Information Bureau Lozovsky stated, "The Soviet government and several People's Committees have temporarily moved to Kuybyshev (formerly Samara) to resume work. The Soviet Defense Committee, led by Stalin, will remain in Moscow to carry out its tasks. The transfer of some government agencies is by no means a sign that the defense of Moscow has weakened. On the contrary, defensive work will continue with even greater courage and determination. In other words, the Soviet government and people will continue to resist until Hitler's Germany is completely defeated. At a time when the enemy has broken through a certain point near Mozhaisk, Moscow is carrying out a partial evacuation so that diplomatic corps and some government agencies can continue their work in a safe environment."

Reuters, London, 24th: News received here today indicates that the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, and members of the British mission have established an office in Kuybyshev (Samara). The Soviet Union has clearly declared that Moscow remains the Soviet capital. Soviet government leaders, including Stalin, are currently stationed there. However, some government departments and foreign diplomatic missions have temporarily moved to Kuybyshev.

TASS, Moscow, 24th: Last night, a large number of German aircraft attempted to attack Moscow. Most were dispersed by anti-aircraft fire and our aircraft formations. Only a few aircraft penetrated and dropped bombs. Several civilian houses caught fire, resulting in some casualties. No military targets were damaged.

Fresh Soviet Troops Deployed to Central Front; Timoshenko Reassigned to Southern Front

Reuters, London, 24th: Fresh Soviet reserve troops have joined the fighting on the central front. German forces are also concentrating their main forces again to attack Moscow. At the same time, the Germans are still trying to break through the Perekop Isthmus to enter Crimea and seize the industrial area of the Donets Basin. According to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and government spokesman Lozovsky, former Central Front Commander General Timoshenko has taken over command of the Southern Front. Generals Budyonny and Voroshilov have both completed the preparation of new troops and will soon join the front. German losses in the new offensive over the past 20 days have reached 300,000 men. The new Central Front Commander, General Zhukov, is currently leading his troops in fierce fighting with the German army near Kalinin, 100 miles northwest of Moscow. The city is currently in the hands of the Soviet army.

Reuters, London, 24th: A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph reports that according to responsible sources, General Zhukov's appointment as Commander of the Soviet Central Front does not imply any criticism of General Timoshenko. Stalin has selected Timoshenko for a very important new task. The public can only speculate on this appointment. However, in the eyes of a far-sighted military strategist like Stalin, organizing well-prepared resistance in the North Caucasus region, behind General Budyonny's troops and the entire Don and Volga River front, will be the second key step in the future. People here are very familiar with Zhukov's military knowledge and believe that he will be able to handle the new task. Zhukov has served as Deputy Commissar of Defense and Chief of the Soviet General Staff and has had close contact with Stalin, who serves as the Defense Commissar.

Germany Exerting All Efforts to Assault Soviet Capital; Hoping to End War Against Soviet Union Soon

Central News Agency, London, 24th: British military experts recently stated that all the forces of the German war machine have simultaneously rushed towards the snowy area near Moscow, the wetlands of the Crimean Isthmus, and the muddy areas of the Donets Basin, in an attempt to begin the task of ending their conquest of western Russia. They also stated that the German army has reached the limit of its offensive power and must achieve the goal of ending the war in order to prepare for the second phase of the winter war, an attack on the Near East. British military experts stated that if the German army wins a complete victory in these three theaters in the next few weeks, it can complete the hopes listed in its timetable, pacify the central and northern Soviet front lines, and at the same time, the Nazis also hope to invade southern Ukraine to probe into the Caucasus or Turkey, or even advance on both places simultaneously, so that they can realize their hope of attacking the Suez Canal and re-launch a Libyan war. They also stated that various unpleasant news from Moscow has shown that Hitler is desperately deploying troops in an attempt to capture the Soviet capital and expects that the Soviet Union's acknowledgment of fierce fighting north and south of Moscow will reveal that the Germans are launching fierce attacks on the Soviet capital by means of flanking maneuvers or encirclements.

Reuters, Moscow, 24th: The Soviet newspaper Izvestia reports that on the ninth day of the battle for Moscow, the Germans invaded Kalinin (an important city 100 miles northwest of Moscow). Street fighting is currently underway. The enemy is using large numbers of tanks in dense attacks, but the Red Army is resolutely resisting. Not only have they repelled the enemy's attacks, but they have also launched successful counterattacks. The Soviet army is determined to defend the city at all costs and has built anti-tank obstacles in the streets. The city is full of trenches, like a honeycomb.

Reuters, London, 24th: The battle for Moscow has entered its third week. The Soviets announced that they had repelled multiple fierce attacks by Nazi forces in the Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets areas. Soviet forces behind the German front lines in several areas of the Moscow front are operating quite successfully, and guerrillas near Smolensk and Kalinin are particularly active. The Germans claim that in the past few days, the German army has broken through a wide front near Mozhaisk, and the vanguard has reached a location within 40 miles of Moscow. On the southern front, the German army has launched a renewed offensive towards Crimea. Intense land and air battles are reported at Perekop. Although German casualties are heavy, they are constantly reinforced with fresh troops. Heavy snowstorms are currently occurring around Leningrad at the northern end of the front. News from Moscow reports intense street fighting is still taking place south of the city of Kalinin, northwest of Moscow. On the southwestern front, the German army is being firmly blocked in the Orel region. The recent Soviet communique stated that 37 German aircraft were destroyed on Wednesday, and 11 Soviet aircraft were also lost. It is now known that a total of 35 German aircraft were shot down near the Soviet capital on Wednesday, not the previously reported 16. In addition, a Soviet aircraft formation attacked a German-held airfield and destroyed 100 German fighter planes.

The Soviet newspaper Izvestia reports that the Soviet forces on the northern front, about two months ago, were forced to abandon Novgorod after six days of fierce fighting due to being outnumbered. However, the German attempt to continue advancing across the Volkhov River and Lake Ilmen has failed. After the Soviet army evacuated Novgorod, they defended their positions along the lake and river. All German advances were repelled by Soviet artillery fire and infantry counterattacks. Although the German army repeatedly changed its tactics, it has not gained an inch to this day. The German army once sent two companies of infantry across the river, hoping to launch a fierce attack on the Soviet lines. In addition to ordinary infantry weapons, the two German companies were equipped with direct-fire guns, small steel guns, and mortars, but they were eventually completely annihilated by the Soviet army, and all special equipment was abandoned on the battlefield. The Soviet army used these steel guns and mortars to bombard enemy positions. In addition, the German army has repeatedly made attempts to advance, but also encountered the same tragic results. At the same time, the Soviet garrison has formed "suppression" battalions, which operate behind enemy lines to destroy German fortifications and transportation, and hold the highways and railways between Xingke and Novgorod amidst constant artillery fire to block enemy movements. The Red Army artillery in this area has destroyed 60 German cannons and 35 mortar teams.

Germany, Leveraging its Superiority in Troop Strength, Launches Large-Scale Invasion of Crimea

Reuters, London, 24th: A Reuters military commentator states that according to recent communiques, intense fighting has broken out along the entire Eastern Front. The German High Command communique first mentions the battle for Moscow, stating that German forces have advanced to within 38 miles of Moscow in some locations, and that the Soviet front lines in a vast area west and southwest of Moscow have been broken. However, the German side also acknowledges that Soviet resistance is very strong. The Soviet communique only states that there is fierce fighting on the front lines, but judging from news reports and broadcasts from Moscow radio, the German army has deployed fresh troops and has only made slight progress by relying on numerical superiority. The impact of the weather on the war is gradually increasing, and the German army must already be experiencing inconvenience. Recent news reports that it rains and snows during the day and freezes at night, but it cannot yet be said that severe winter has begun. Regarding the battle situation on the southern front, the Soviets stated that they have contained the German forces advancing east from Taganrog, and the Soviets have not admitted that Stalino has been lost. German advances towards Rostov and Kharkov may not have made any progress. However, the German army has launched a renewed large-scale attack on Crimea. Its vanguard has made slight progress on the Perekop Isthmus and has reached Yushun at the southeastern end of the isthmus. The Soviet garrison will apparently concentrate its firepower on this narrow isthmus and put up the strongest resistance. The German side may use paratroopers or air-transported troops for this, but the Soviet army is prepared and controls the sea, making it easy to transport military supplies and fresh troops to reinforce the Crimean garrison.

Reuters, Kuybyshev, 24th: The German Southern Front army, led by General von Rundstedt, launched an offensive towards Taganrog, making a second attempt to capture the city. Previously, the German army advanced eastward across Ukraine and, after capturing Mariupol, attacked the small city of Taganrog, hoping to capture it in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, it encountered strong Soviet resistance and could not advance. Rundstedt urgently deployed reserve troops and carried out flanking maneuvers, but also failed. He then changed his tactics, continued to deploy fresh troops as reinforcements, and knowing that he could not advance along the coast, attacked the right flank of the Soviet army to the north. Both sides gathered large armies to fight. The German army suffered heavy losses. Although the Soviet army recovered some areas, the Rundstedt's troops were very strong and launched a second attack. The Soviet army was outnumbered and has now been forced to retreat to new positions.

### Eden Reaffirms Guarantee Not to Negotiate with Germany; Will Provide Maximum Aid to the Soviet Union to Secure Victory; British House of Commons Holds Free Debate on War Situation

Reuters, London, 24th: Foreign Secretary Eden assured the House of Commons yesterday that the British government will not negotiate any matters with Hitler or others. Eden revealed that there was a time, in the summer of 1940, when there was not a single division of troops in Britain that was well-trained and well-equipped, so that Britain had no defense in reality, and the Middle East forces at that time also lacked all modern equipment. The Foreign Secretary also stated that the term "aid to the Soviet Union" was incorrect and should be "aid to common victory." The whole purpose is one purpose. The British side holds this view, so it is transporting urgently needed supplies to the Soviet Union and opening up a route through Iran. At a time like the present, the government's responsibility is to use judgment to determine its plans and maintain its policy. If we do not do everything we can to help the Soviet Union, it will at least be of no benefit to us. The British government has studied the opportunity presented by the German attack on the Soviet Union, but the results cannot be disclosed now, otherwise it will fall into the enemy's trap. Eden concluded by stating that he can issue a guarantee that the government will provide the Soviet Union with all possible assistance within its capabilities, and he asks the members of the House of Commons to trust those who are carrying out this policy. Uniting the strength of the country is the best way to help the Soviet Union.

Reuters, London, 24th: A Reuters political correspondent reports that the debate in the House of Commons on the war situation retains its original character, that is, many members of Parliament freely discuss various issues without any reservations. Foreign Secretary Eden's reply, "We are determined to give the Soviet Union all the assistance we can in every way, and the British government does not want to negotiate any matters with Hitler or others," did not cause any reaction, because the government always takes this courteous action towards the House of Commons after the House of Commons discusses major events. At the same time, members of Parliament also focus on other issues such as the organization of supplies and manpower, because this is related to the entire war effort. As a whole, the country and members of Parliament are determined to actively assist the Soviet Union and to inflict a severe blow on the enemy as soon as possible, so the Parliament will continue to urge the government to continue to adopt necessary plans as permitted by the environment. Therefore, criticism of the government by members of Parliament will continue, but this is constructive criticism and should not be regarded as any political inconvenience to the government at present.

Young British Women Sell Kisses to Raise Funds; One Kiss for One Shilling; £6 Million Already Raised

Reuters, London, 24th: A team of beautiful, unmarried women from a Birmingham armaments factory is currently selling kisses to raise funds for the city's warships. The price is set at one shilling per kiss, but most customers are offering up to two shillings and sixpence. 42 pounds have been sold in the last three days. According to an official, only female employees initially launched the initiative, but female workers soon followed suit, and there is currently a lot of competition between the two sides. Birmingham has raised £6,770,000 towards its target of £10 million for this weekend.

Editorial

### Ever-Rising Prices

Over the past week, the turmoil and commotion in the Shanghai market have remained unchanged from previous days, with prices soaring and speculation rampant. The cost of living continues to decline, with prices rising by hundreds or thousands of yuan within the city and fluctuating by more than ten resolutions in a single day. We only see prices going up, never down, only advancing, never retreating, as if the legal tender is worthless. This has led to this abnormal state, which cannot be judged by ordinary logic!

Although Shanghai is far from the theater of war, it has not escaped the wartime atmosphere, so it is still constrained by the movements of the war. It is difficult to achieve fairness in small transactions, and even more difficult to achieve accuracy. Moreover, in the absence of regulation, all kinds of evil forces are acting together, with both buying and selling short intermingled. Biased words are easily listened to, and great profits are easily motivated. Manipulation and hoarding are connected, which is inevitable in reality. However, to maintain social stability, it is essential to maintain the stability of life. Today, the instability of general life has reached its extreme. What is earned in the morning is not enough to ensure a full meal in the evening. Goods are abundant but stubbornly refuse to be sold, because the price of goods is rising too fast, only going up and not down. Although hoarding may have twists and turns, as long as it is given a little time, it will be as good as one wishes, which is why more and more is hoarded, and the price of goods is difficult to stabilize.

To stabilize prices, one must rely on strength; strength refers to administrative strength and economic strength! Administrative strength means having the actual power to regulate the market, but the methods must not allow for exceptions, and the handling must not allow for differences. Those who go against this must be corrected and punished. However, administrative strength is sometimes exhausted; moreover, market regulation cannot be entirely achieved by power. Even the exercise of power may lead to the ineffectiveness of regulation, with loopholes emerging and being coerced. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement it with economic strength, just as the initial restriction of rice prices by the Shanghai Municipal Council was ineffective, but public sales could achieve some success in maintaining the people's food supply.

If it is said that regulating prices only requires focusing on retail, and not questioning wholesale, then it is as if hoarding and speculating are not being addressed. Is it that we will exercise administrative power to interfere? Otherwise, it is no different from making a small piece of wood taller than a towering building. It must be understood that the reason why prices are so high today is not entirely due to the hoarding of retailers, but to the collusion of speculative merchants, large households hoarding, and intermediaries. If there is a plan to get to the root of the problem, then effective steps should be taken for the futures and spot markets. For example, the buying and selling of gold itself has nothing to do with daily necessities; and its rise is not due to any changes in foreign exchange. It is simply that a few people suddenly suffer from gold poisoning, taking advantage of the fact that more than half of the gold bars are in cellars and the lack of circulating chips in the market to collect them in a big way, not minding the price, not considering it too much. Those who hold goods naturally regard themselves as rare commodities. A transaction volume of four or five hundred bars often rises by thousands of yuan. Yesterday, it even saw a high price of 18,900 yuan. Another example is Shuangma cotton yarn, where actual sales are not moving, and many weaving factories are reducing work, but the price of yarn is galloping, with no day without a limit-up and no day without a new high price. All industries are delighted at the sight of profit, regardless of sales, the amount of inventory, or the strength of the source, and they are able to raise prices. In this way, it directly threatens the lives of the masses; the rise in rice, flour, oil, and beans, the expensiveness of clothing and miscellaneous items, the high price of candles, soap, cigarettes, and paper, and the exorbitant rent are all clearly caused by a few people affecting the overall situation.

The fact that we supply foreign exchange, and that the black market exchange rate is still allowed to be rampant, is also a major reason why prices are not easy to stabilize. If foreign exchange is supplied as usual, then how it is supplied should be clearly stated; if it is no longer supplied, then it should be announced as soon as possible, so what is there to worry about. The most heartbreaking thing is indecision, hesitation, and rumors abound. The heart is empty and panicked, as if leaving this loophole is not only creating opportunities for speculative merchants, but also creating room for those with capital to escape. If normal necessities are still supplied with foreign exchange as usual, then the goods supplied should be announced weekly so that the public has the necessary knowledge and does not allow buying and selling merchants to embezzle them. The price should be fairly determined by the importer and the industry in accordance with their reasonable profits, and this should be followed as the retail price, without any increase or decrease. The goods should be directly distributed to retailers by wholesalers or agents, and should not be circulated and traded on the market under the names of warehouse receipts or futures, for the purpose of manipulation and hoarding. Wholesalers should try to deal directly with consumers as much as possible, but it may be possible to slightly limit the sales volume. That is, practitioners should also distribute goods to wholesalers or brokerage firms according to the actual sales volume of their street, and should not allow them to monopolize sales, just like the recent actions of various industries. Publicly sold goods, whether publicly or privately owned, should be sold under the same evaluation and sales organization so that the quality and price are unified, and expensive goods are not mixed with inferior goods, so as not to cause obstacles in procurement and lose credibility with consumers. It is also necessary to have a proper method of popularizing to direct consumers, not targeting traders and manufacturers. The last sale of flat-rate flour only benefited intermediaries and peddlers who lived by trading, and genuine consumers had no way to buy it.

British and American merchants, because of the advice of their governments, sacrificed temporary small profits and sought cooperation with the Chinese Stabilization Board, and cooperation requires sincere cooperation, not superficial agreement and internal discord. All unnecessary commodities, even if the profits are generous, should not be underwritten; the foreign exchange of exported goods should still be settled with the Stabilization Board; the elimination of the black market exchange rate should be done with the greatest effort; the difficulties currently facing us should be overcome together. Moreover, Shanghai's essential necessities of life, such as rice and flour, and other foreign goods, are now mostly supplied by Hong Kong. Today, the price of goods in Hong Kong has not changed much, but the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai is frequently tightening in the black market, with a wide disparity. If the original relationship can be maintained and today's exchange rate can be improved, it may slightly alleviate the difficulties of Shanghai's life and form an economic and popular front to cope with the present and plan for the future, which is a crucial plan.

European War Anecdotes

### The Anguish of the French

This article was written by the famous French reporter He Sales, originally published in the American "Atlantic Monthly". I have copied it below, from which we can see the anguish of the French after the defeat:

What does it mean to be French? Until a year ago, I never thought about this question, just as I would not ask myself why I was born with two hands and two feet.

I was born in France and educated in France. I have lived in France for most of my life. I have traveled everywhere and know the situation in France very well. I love the richness and diversity of France, the different situations in each province, and the different climates. When I returned from a long trip, I really felt like I had seen an old friend. Whether it was the air, the light, the fields, the trees, the cities, or the villages, they all gave me a very familiar impression, just like looking in the mirror and seeing my own face. At that time, I did not say to myself: "This is France, I am a Frenchman." Such obvious things do not need to be mentioned, of course. But when I saw the spire of a church, or a road lined with poplars, or tasted the flavor of bread, the infinite complexity of this intimate feeling once again proved that I have been unconsciously connected with this special place on earth since I was born.

I also know that the French who were born in the same era as me, and the millions of French who have been born here, grown here, worked here, and died here throughout the ages, have done many great things in the past and produced many great people. In the future, they will certainly be able to continue to rise up and fulfill their part of the responsibility for building civilization.

I also know our faults and am troubled and uneasy about them. I like to read the writings of Stendhal (the pen name of the French writer Beyle). He sincerely believes that he does not like the French, saying that they are flashy and impractical, but in fact, is he not extremely so himself?

I don't know if I am a patriot. I don't even know if I am a good Frenchman. I have never asked myself. In the first thirty years of my life, I paid more attention to literature, art, and music, and not much attention to politics. When politics (this is politics in a broad sense) became my main career, I did not think that those who agreed with me were good Frenchmen, and those who disagreed with me were not as good as them. In my opinion, it seems that one of the best advantages of being French is the freedom to disagree with others.

In short, my feelings about this question a few months ago, as far as I can remember, I feel that there has never been any conflict between my awareness of being born a human being and my accidental birth as a Frenchman. France seems to have a certain value for me, and this value is so universal, so broad, and so empathetic that it makes people patiently experience many wars, many revolutions, and many disputes among many talented French people.

I never thought that France could be destroyed. I don't believe it now, but I have to add a note when I say this today. First, I don't know what method France will use, or what kind of reincarnation it must go through, to be able to re-express her lively spirit. Second, I don't know if France's rebirth will be something I will see in my lifetime, or if I will have to wait thirty, fifty, or a hundred years. Finally, if this matter can be realized in the near future, I don't know if I can recognize or understand the signs of rebirth. There may be many vain attempts to rebuild France, and I don't know if I can avoid falling into this trap or going astray.

If this is something that only I or a few people encounter, it is of course irrelevant except to ourselves. But this suffering is almost what we all have to encounter, what 40 million French people who are now struggling in the shadows of disappointment, sorrow, and hardship have to encounter together.

France has lost everything. In this defeat, every Frenchman and France itself has suffered a deadly blow. Those who want to prove to themselves and others for various reasons that this is not an absolute failure are deceiving themselves with a bad conscience. When I say that France has lost everything or suffered a fatal blow, I am speaking for the current generation. I know very well that young people have new lives ahead of them. They may be able to rebuild from the rubble, but today, there is only a pile of rubble. This is the reality.

I often see new maps of France in the newspapers, divided by the boundaries of the occupied and unoccupied zones, and I feel deeply hurt and heartbroken. A map is originally abstract, but this boundary is a transcendent reality, because it represents the country's dismemberment. This is not our defined national border, but the arbitrary disposal of the victors. It is like this today, and it can be changed tomorrow. This boundary passes through rivers, roads, and railways. Because of this boundary, France's blood cannot circulate in the body. Moreover, the result of dismemberment not only affects the material life of the people, but also affects their moral and psychological relations. Families are dispersed because of this. Even if France has the possibility of reunifying, it will be blocked by this boundary. Those who live in the south and those who live in the north are isolated from each other, as if there is a high-voltage power line between them. This is a special form of Nazi brutality, often with a sadomasochistic color. This boundary is tantamount to dividing France into two concentration camps, the only difference being that one is directly ruled by the Germans, and the other is under the illusion of the French that they are still under their own protection.

It is not necessary to spend too much time talking about the chaos of French life. Newspaper reports and travelers' talks have already given detailed descriptions. What is strange is that a country that has always been characterized by abundance, comfort, and elegance has fallen so quickly. I know that there is a school of thought in France that believes that the tragedy suffered today is also due to the weakness cultivated by the people's comfortable life. Marshal Pétain seems to belong to this school. It is inevitable that taking butter instead of guns lacks foresight, but I still believe that this is not a sin. France has always wanted to allow everyone to obtain a perfect life as much as possible, and her attempt has achieved no small success. If measured by statistics, the living standard in France is still not as high as that in the United States, but as far as its pervasive nature is concerned, it seems to be unmatched by any country. At least that's what the outside world thinks. France is also known to the world for this.

This particularity of French life has now become a historical relic. The hardships of today may give rise to a new kind of spirit. This assumption may be correct. But many French people think that the sins we are suffering now are well-deserved. In my opinion, it is a mistake of judgment, due to too much disappointment. It is tantamount to saying that the French are too civilized, so they are now being punished. If so, it is tantamount to admitting the Nazi doctrine. In the world, there is no other law besides strength. Brutality is a healthy behavior. There is no other purpose than to maintain efficiency for the sake of efficiency and to organize a mechanical country.

Unfortunately, many French people, even the best French people, cannot help but be shocked by the power of the German war machine, and dare not think of anything other than material efficiency. There is no question about the superiority of German war materials and their skillful use. As a result, most French people want to rationalize their failure, according to the Q-style, as if calculating a general one. If this kind of French ethics is applied with effort, it is indeed the most dangerous thing in intellectual activity. With this ability, the French have established a series of realistic formulas to explain the inevitability of the paths they have taken in the past and to plan their future actions.

### After the Completion of the Hong Kong Economic Conference, Shanghai's Legal Tender Situation Can Be Improved

The Stabilization Fund Committee Established a Kunming Branch to Be Responsible for Reviewing Merchants' Requests for Foreign Exchange

Chongqing According to the news released here today, the Chinese Fu Bureau is confident that after the completion of the meeting of Chinese, British and American economic representatives in Hong Kong, the situation of Shanghai's legal tender can be improved. The Hong Kong meeting should discuss the plan to deal with the situation in Shanghai. At the same time, the Kunming news said that Kunming has set up an office representing the Chinese Stabilization Board to review foreign exchange applications. The Kunming office will be held by the American representative Dai Le and the Chinese representative Tu Weiying (transliteration). (Reuters, 24th)

Chongqing Kunming News The Stabilization Fund Committee has established a branch here, responsible for reviewing commercial exchange, which was established on the 21st, presided over by Dai Lai and Du Weiying. Those merchants who need foreign exchange submit an application to one of the four banks of China, China, Transportation, and Agriculture. If the bank believes it is justified, it will transfer it to the branch for application on its behalf. Therefore, the right to approve or disapprove commercial exchange is still in the hands of the Niuzhun Association. In addition to commercial exchange, travel expenses, insurance fees, and living expenses can also be given in cash within a certain limit. Those who apply for foreign exchange mostly use Hong Kong dollars. (Havas, 24th)

### One Week of War Situation October 16th to 22nd

Chongqing The military committee spokesman said that since the Japanese defeat in northern Hunan and their failures in western Hubei, northern Hubei, and Henan, their vitality has been greatly damaged, and they have begun to believe that the more the Chinese army fights, the stronger it becomes, which is not an empty word. Therefore, they have some concerns and dare not act rashly. Therefore, this week has entered a state of truce, but they are still rushing to build fortifications in Zhengzhou in order to consolidate its periphery, erect pontoon bridges to facilitate its rear, and continue to increase their troops. We judge that the Japanese not only have the intention of occupying it for a long time, but may also be planning something. As for the general war situation, the larger ones are described as follows:

South Bank of the Yellow River

The various troops counterattacking in central Henan have made considerable gains in recent days. In addition to capturing Zhangzhuang Street in Zhongmu and recovering Dahu Village in Rongze, they have also captured the Wulipu stronghold on the outskirts of Zhengzhou, and the Japanese have been retreating towards Zhengzhou city. In order to reverse the decline, the Japanese are still gathering more than 4,000 troops and more than a dozen cannons and seven tanks from south of the Yellow River Railway Bridge. At dawn on the 21st, they advanced in three groups towards Guangwu. At 11 o'clock, they invaded the city. The Chinese army is currently fiercely resisting in the Tangdong, Tanggang, and Wanglou areas.

Suiyuan Area

The ten-way troops of Huaihua attacking Anbei, Guyang, and Lianxian have encountered the Japanese for days, destroying many Japanese cannons and tanks, and killing many Japanese. They also killed three Japanese captains and a number of soldiers under them behind Kundulun. At the same time, the Chinese attacked the Japanese who were entrenched in Dashiwan, Xiaowei, and Zhaojun Tomb, and the gains were even greater. In addition to killing hundreds of Japanese, they also captured personnel, war horses, and many other supplies. They also completely destroyed the Japanese communication facilities from Zhaojun Tomb to Youyi Village.

Western Hubei Area

The Japanese have increased to more than 1,000 in Changmuyuan, Maolaodian, Lujiaodian and other places south of Shayang, and are invading south in several directions. The Chinese are resisting. The Japanese who invaded south from Jiangling Cenhekou were defeated by the Chinese. More than 4,000 Japanese were reinforced from Shashi and attacked Zifusi, Panzhangqiao, Wujiaqiao and other places in several directions. Their vanguard continued to advance towards Zhuhekou and has been strongly resisted by the Chinese. The battle is extremely fierce.

Northern Jiangxi Area

The Japanese who were entrenched in Zhonghengjinkou, Boyouhe and other places east of Wuning were completely defeated by the Chinese and fled towards Zhu. (23rd telegram)

### The United States Changes the Route for Aiding the Soviet Union, Not Related to the Pacific Situation The Official Explanation is that This Move is Not Appeasement of Japan, and it is Most Convenient to Transport Soviet Military Supplies via the White Sea

Reuters Washington, 24th The State Department has strongly denied the claim that the news that the US Shipping Commission will ship all goods to the Soviet Union from the port of Boston is related to the Japanese situation in the Pacific. Earlier this week, there was a rumor that the new Japanese government had notified the United States that items destined for the Soviet Union passing through Vladivostok would be intercepted. Well-informed sources said that the fastest route to supply the Soviet army is from Boston via the North Atlantic and the White Sea to Arkangelsk.

Havas Washington, 22nd After the US Shipping Commission decided to designate the port of Boston as the only port for shipping military equipment to the Soviet Union, there were rumors that this matter was related to the situation in the Pacific. The State Department has recently denied this claim. O'Leary, the private secretary of President Roosevelt, told reporters that the United States' material assistance to the Soviet Union will be delivered on time, and the quantity will be equal to the promise made by the US delegation in Moscow. President Roosevelt has already stated this. As for when the goods must arrive and where they will be shipped from, there is no need to explain. It is reported that US newspapers carried news from Japan that the Japanese government intends to obstruct US ships carrying military equipment to the port of Vladivostok. Therefore, in order to avoid unexpected incidents between the United States and Japan, the United States has decided to temporarily not use the port of Vladivostok to transport military equipment to the Soviet Union. In view of the above statement of the State Department, it can be seen that this conclusion is obviously wrong. The responsible parties also said that the US Shipping Commission's decision was actually for another reason. In other words, it is to speed up the shipment of goods to Moscow. If it takes ten days to ship from the port of Vladivostok, it will only take 48 hours to arrive from the port of Archangelsk. However, according to Article 2 of the current Neutrality Act, US merchant ships cannot sail to the White Sea and the port of Archangelsk. Therefore, before this clause is repealed, US merchant ships must still fly foreign flags.

Reuters London, 27th This news, that the US Shipping Commission should announce that goods destined for the USSR are now to take the Arkhangelsk route, is viewed here as rather odd, and indeed there was a lot of curiosity expressed yesterday. Official sources here are reserving comment until the receipt of information from the British embassy in the US, however the diplomatic correspondent for the Times claims that the Commission will have many reasons for making that decision, that Tokyo thinks it already understands the reasons, when in fact it does not. Indeed in recent months, there have been many answers to the question of why the US was forced to abandon the original route, for example, in August, when Japan issued a communique to the US and Soviet Union on the matter, both nations responded that they would continue to use the route to Vladivostok, being just one such example. The US, although not wishing to provoke Japan in any way, has indicated in private and public, that it will not sacrifice the Soviet Union to concede to Japan. That respondent also states that on the other hand, if that Commission's announcement contains any implication that it is abandoning Vladivostok as a route open to US vessels, then it will have some impact on the US-Japan talks, but the US Department of State has strenuously denied this.

### US and Japan Seek Understanding Negotiations Continue

Japanese Spokesman Ishii Declares That Established National Policy Will Not Be Abandoned

Reuters Tokyo, 14th Japanese Information Bureau spokesman Ishii, in his usual routine with foreign reporters this morning, stated that Japan could not terminate the establishment of the "New Order in East Asia." When reporters questioned other aspects of Japan's policy, Ishii would not provide a definitive answer, but said that US-Japan talks are currently ongoing in Washington. As for the content of any messages received on this matter following the cabinet reshuffle, Ishii would not disclose. Ishii told reporters that the United States' decision to stop transporting military supplies from Vladivostok to the Soviet Union was a very good thing related to all countries. He believed that this move could ease the relationship between the United States and Japan. However, as a member of the Axis powers, Japan could not completely ignore the transportation of war equipment to the Soviet Union. Ishii then referred to an editorial in the Japanese newspaper Guangzhi Shiyuan, which stated that Japan was the only appropriate country to mediate world peace, saying that this was the opinion of the newspaper and not the government, but it was very good, and no one could object to world peace.

### American Liner Refuses to Carry Japanese Passengers; President Line Denies the Rumor; Tatsuta Maru Arrives at Honolulu

Reuters, Manila, 24th - The local office of the American President Lines today denied the report in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun that President Lines would refuse to allow Japanese people to travel on their ships. The company stated that it had refunded fares to three Japanese individuals because the next ship going eastward would not stop at Shanghai, and these three individuals did not wish to disembark in Hong Kong. At the same time, the Philippine High Commissioner's Office stated that it was unaware of any reported restrictions on transportation regulations. However, the office acknowledged that licensing procedures had been tightened. The office also admitted that it had recently revoked several permits for Japanese transfers of iron ore, because Japanese ships were no longer calling at Philippine ports, and the cancellations were requested by the Japanese themselves.

Reuters, Honolulu, 24th - The "Tatsuta Maru" arrived here yesterday from Japan, carrying 606 passengers, of whom 273 disembarked here. The remainder will proceed to San Francisco today.

It is said that the so-called bills refer to increasing the military budget, increasing taxes, and increasing rice production measures. This extraordinary session, lasting only five days, could easily be extended indefinitely.

### Wild Rise, Sharp Fall, Sudden Reaction: Gold Market Up and Down 3,200 Yuan: Highest Price 18,900 Yuan

Yesterday, the gold market experienced amazing storms and became increasingly treacherous. It started with a fall, followed by a wild rise, and then a sharp fall. There were often fluctuations of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Each continued bid from the supply and demand sides raised the price by at least 50 to 100 yuan, and sometimes the buyer's request to purchase would raise the price by 500 yuan. The opposite was also true for sellers. The chaotic situation can be seen in general. The morning started with the money shops releasing their holdings, resulting in a low opening price of 15,700 yuan.

In the afternoon, it soared to an unprecedented high price of 18,900 yuan, due to the release of holdings by gold shops and the Chaozhou and Tianjin gangs. There were even rumors of negative news, and those who released their holdings gathered together, causing a 2,000 yuan drop. It retreated to 16,800 yuan. In the end, a certain bank rushed in again to purchase 700 to 800 taels, and the price rose again. The market closed up 820 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 6,000 taels.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: the Central Bank and HSBC exchange rates did not change. The prices at the small counters of HSBC and others were also flat. The black market for British and American exchange rates was still in a chaotic state and continued to become tight. The unprecedented new expensive price of having prices but no market was seen again. Many people were seeking to settle US exchange rates at 3.125 yuan, but no transactions were heard being made, even though there were some sellers at less than 3 yuan.

### Silk Market Waves Soaring: Two Situations in One Day: Morning Limit Up... Afternoon Limit Down

The situation in the silk market is still fierce, and the market is in constant turmoil, making people feel uneasy all day long. It is completely terrified by the price of gold. People generally ignore everything. When the price of gold jumps, they drag it in, and when it falls, they release it. Therefore, the market is full of soaring waves. The morning opened with 20-count Double Horse. Today, there are large investors coming out to maintain the market, which can stabilize the market and prevent it from hitting the limit up. The first market price was 2,475 yuan. At this time, the situation was soft, gradually falling back to 2,370 yuan, falling by 100 yuan from the opening. However, the market tightened, and at the same time, the price of gold rose, and the price of the transaction jumped, and the rising wind suddenly rose. Although a certain party tried its best to sell at 2,490 yuan, the buyers kept calling for higher prices to buy in. As a result, it was still the limit up of 2,490 yuan, and the after-hours market had reached 2,520 yuan, creating a terrifying situation. The market could not be done in the afternoon. In the afternoon, the prices of yarn and cloth in the transaction all fell miserably, because the rumor said that there was a rumor of settlement, and at the same time, there was negative news. Gold Double Horse also hit the limit down. Some people also said that gold fell sharply, and more long positions were released. In short, the silk market was in a chaotic state. According to the statistics of transactions in half a day, there were 15,000 packages. Today, there were 100 pieces of Japanese yarn shipped to Yantai.

The price of Gold Double Horse futures fluctuated sharply, rising and falling by more than 200 yuan. Since this sharp rise in the yarn market, the limit up has been reached more than five times in a row. Although the old long investors did not move, there were still many short investors entering and leaving one after another, licking blood from the knife's edge. The pursuit of margin for futures yarn was postponed to 10:00 a.m. The trend in November was soft at first, opening at a low price of 2,290 yuan. After entering, the price gradually rose to 2,360 yuan. The opening price in December was 2,370 yuan, and it rose to 2,430 yuan. The opening price in January hit the limit up. Suddenly, it rose by as much as 100 yuan. The second market was open, and the markets in November and December also hit the limit up. In the afternoon, rumors spread, and the factory orders could not be delivered, and the people in the futures yarn market became more and more panicked. More short positions were added, and the market price turned sharply downward. The prices of near-term and long-term futures all hit the limit down. The difference between one rise and one fall reached as much as 200 yuan. Such a volatile market is chaotic, and its trend is even more difficult to predict. A list is provided below.

### Cotton Prices Differ in the Morning and Evening

The current situation of cotton: the price rose in the morning following the silk market, but in the afternoon, the momentum was weak due to negative news and the fall in gold prices.

US-grown Pengjiabore 100 pieces 778.0 No. home

Langgonghua 100 pieces 58.02 again

Another 200 pieces 577.0 again

Another 100 pieces 81.0 again

Another 100 pieces 580.0 again

Fire Machine Grass Bag 500 pieces 500.0 again

The New York cotton market rose because of Washington political news reports that the Senate had passed the 100% 1942 and 1943 New Loan Cotton Act. Speculators and Southern gangs bought in, or short positions were covered, all of which were active and fierce. As a result, the closing price rose by about 27 to 50 pounds more than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market was closed yesterday due to a bank holiday. It is also predicted that the opening price today will rise by 4 rupees compared to the previous day.

### Rice Prices Expected to Weaken Further

Foreign rice prices rose in the morning but fell in the afternoon, with a further decline in the evening. The morning market continued the previous day's upward trend, with some blindly absorbing supplies and sellers raising prices. Speculators, seeing gold prices rising again, became even more active, causing both small and No. 2 Saigon rice to rise to $157-158, and No. 1 Saigon to $173.50. However, after the market price reached its peak, it was reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) was selling small quantities of rice at a flat price, with confirmed continued transactions. Furthermore, there were rumors of favorable exchange rates for supplying goods and flour, and even more bearish rumors. Consequently, those with profits were the first to sell, and large traders also took the opportunity to sell at high prices. In addition, speculative traders followed the trend, causing the market to suddenly decline. Small grain rice plummeted by $8-9, with the afternoon price falling to $149, and continuing to weaken, hovering between $148-149. The overall sentiment was still bearish. Total transactions were less than 20,000 bags. The British firm Inges opened at $181.50 to $180.05 for small grain rice, with an estimated 300-400 tons traded. Currently, the total inventory in various warehouses is 987,771 bags, a decrease of 66,855 bags compared to the previous period.

The supply of thick and thin new polished Japonica rice continues to be scarce, with normal retail sales. Prices continue to increase by $2-3. Early-harvested Southern Harbor rice is quoted at $183-180, Kunshan new Japonica at $181-180, and Qingjiao kiln rice and Fengjing rice are all at $180. Wild rice and Du Jian rice are scarce and there is no market. Glutinous rice remains in short supply, with Hong Kong white glutinous rice priced at $185-186, Zhongguan at $183-180, and Glutinous Lu at $173.50-173, an increase of $1-2 or so.

### Incessant Shipments of Foreign Flour to Tianjin

The foreign flour market was still stable in the morning, as the public sale was inevitable and rumors were bearish. The market gradually weakened. In the afternoon, due to the sharp fall in rice prices and low gold prices, coupled with warnings, those with profits were eager to sell. Large traders and speculators also rushed to sell, causing the market to immediately reverse and decline. Fort Brand opened at $45.50-45.60 in the morning, but the closing price in the afternoon fell to $44.50. Golden Dragon was $44.70-44.50 in the morning, but fell to $43.30 in the afternoon, a sharp drop of $1.40-1.50 compared to the previous market. At the same time, there were speculators selling wheat bran, but there were few buyers. The previous night's off-market price of $46 had already been reduced by $2 in an attempt to sell.

The Jardine Matheson's ship "Fosheng" is sailing from Shanghai to Tianjin today. In addition to 2,900 bags of foreign flour transported from Hong Kong and transshipped to Tianjin, another 9,600 bags of flour were loaded in this city and transported to Tianjin. (Reported by Zu)

### Sharp Advance and Rapid Retreat in the Oil Market

Yesterday, the edible oil market first rose and then fell. Initially, due to the continued rise in cotton yarn and gold, oil speculators continued to absorb supplies and raise prices, pushing the price up by another $3-5. Subsequently, the rise in Japanese military scrip suddenly stopped and reversed, and there were unfavorable rumors, causing a sudden decline in confidence, resulting in a sharp fall. As a result, prices fell by $7-8 compared to the previous day. The total market sales included 200 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 60 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, another 40 barrels of soybean oil, 100 cans of Yantai soybean oil, 200 cans of Jiangbei raw oil, nearly 1,000 loads of Qing oil from the Dayou factory, and 2,500 loads of vegetable oil from various factories.

### Sudden Rise in Domestic Bonds - Mixed Fluctuations in Foreign Bonds

The off-market trading of public bonds was extremely chaotic yesterday. Rumors of a certain kind of "atmosphere" boosted public bonds, and at the same time, there was a rumor that the Sino-British economic agreement had been signed in Hong Kong. For a time, demand exceeded supply. Class C bonds opened at $7.30, an improvement of 20 cents compared to the previous day. At the close, it was raised to over $8, a sudden increase of nearly $1.

As a result, market prices all rose sharply by $1 to $1.80. The prices of Class C and E bonds were originally equal, but now there is a difference of $1.

### Resumption of Sugar Futures Trading - Wild Rise and Sharp Fall

Sugar futures trading has resumed, with prices initially rising and then falling, with significant fluctuations, reaching as much as $20 or more. The sugar industry has always had the reputation of being a "gentleman," but since speculators have become involved, the gentlemanly status has disappeared. The opening price for Company Futures 24 coarse white sugar for late October was $250, the closing price was $62, the highest was $67, and the lowest was $50. Off-exchange trading was at $62. In the afternoon, it was $254. The opening price was $42, the closing price was the highest at $54, and the lowest was $42.50. Off-exchange trading was at $40.

HHX mark was $251, $253, in the afternoon $240, down $1-2 or so. It is said that the reason for the reversal was also due to a certain "atmosphere," which is why the changes were so drastic.

The northward transport of granulated sugar is incessant. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's "Liangzhou" ship transported more than 20,000 bags from this city, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Today, the Jardine Matheson's "Fosheng" ship, sailing from Shanghai to Tianjin, also loaded 3,500 bags of granulated sugar in this city.

### Increased Prices for Assorted Dried Lychees

### French Tram and Electricity Company Announces Electricity Fee Reduction - Setting an Example Amidst Soaring Prices - A Small Amount, But Worthy of Emulation by All Industries - The Price Control Plan May Be Approved Next Week

Regarding the matter of controlling prices in this city, the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), based on the resolution of a special meeting, requested the Consular Body to approve a new clause to the Land Regulations, authorizing the SMC to formulate regulations regarding the management of retail prices of essential goods, in order to control speculation and profiteering. According to information obtained by a reporter from the Dachung News Agency, the leading consul, Hill, is currently soliciting opinions from consuls of various countries. The Japanese consul, Horinouchi Kansei, has already expressed his agreement. At the same time, the SMC has also begun preparations to organize a legitimate management agency, so that after obtaining the approval of the Consular Body, it can announce the measures for managing prices next week and put them into practice.

New Regulations on Electricity Fees in the French Concession

The French Tram and Electricity Company in the French Concession of this port had modestly increased the fees for trams and other vehicles within the concession since the first of this month. However, yesterday the company officially announced that, starting from November 1st, it will reduce electricity fees for lighting and power in the French Concession by 7% to 10%, so that its prices are the same as those used between August 1st and September 30th. However, the prices of water, trams, trolleybuses, and public bus tickets will remain unchanged. The prices that took effect on the first of this month will continue to be valid. The new electricity prices are listed below: (1) Lighting fees will be reduced from 60 cents to 56 cents per kilowatt-hour (KWH). (2) Electric heating will be reduced from 37 cents to 34 cents per KWH. (3) Power installations above 10 horsepower will be reduced from 39 cents to 36 cents per KWH. (4) Power installations below 10 horsepower will be reduced from 38 cents to 35 cents per KWH. The water fee will remain at 34 cents per cubic meter. Public transport fares will remain as they are. Amidst the current soaring prices, the French water company can still modestly reduce prices. Although the amount is very small, the spirit of its implementation is worthy of emulation by other industries. It is hoped that other industries will not be blinded by greed, disregard the public interest, and frequently raise prices. According to reliable sources, the content of the new clause submitted by the SMC to the Consular Body is roughly divided into three or four items, focusing on essential goods designated by the authorities (such as rice and imported wheat), and setting the maximum retail price to prevent speculation and profiteering. If the violator is Chinese, the SMC will exercise its authority to implement investigations, transfer the case to the First Special District Court for punishment, and revoke their business license. If the violator is a foreigner enjoying extraterritorial rights, the SMC, in accordance with the Land Regulations, may entrust the consular office of the violator's country to impose penalties, in addition to revoking the business license. The SMC will also formulate penalty rules based on the new clause of the Land Regulations, imposing severe punishments on anyone who deliberately raises prices, in order to effectively suppress and stabilize prices.

Separate Implementation of Flour Control

According to information obtained by a reporter from the Dachung News Agency, the SMC has now adopted a new measure to manage prices, in order to control flour prices. It is said that it will be implemented within a few days. Yesterday, a spokesman for the SMC refused to comment on the flour market situation, but stated that the SMC has considered a plan to control the transportation and sale of flour, and stated that it is different from the plan to manage rice prices. It is said that this plan was suggested a month ago and was decided to be implemented this week. The SMC hopes that this move will completely control flour prices within the concession. However, this plan will be implemented separately and will not be included in the management of other prices.

The Bureau's Request Will Eventually Be Approved

The Continental Daily reported that authoritative sources recently stated that the Consular Body is carefully considering and studying the price control proposal submitted by the SMC at the beginning of this week. Although it has not been confirmed by all parties, the Bureau believes that the members of the Consular Body are all considering how much authority should be granted to the SMC in this situation. Initially, it was rumored that the proposal could be approved within a few days, but in the current situation, it is expected to be approved in a week. In any case, the Consular Body will eventually grant the SMC special powers to manage prices. However, the technical procedures for accepting this proposal are extremely complicated. The Consular Body may hold a special meeting to make a final decision on this matter. The question of whether the SMC will establish an agency to implement the new price management policy, or whether the SMC will directly manage it, will also be decided at the same time.

Consular Court Still Needs to Study It

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that responsible individuals recently told reporters that the SMC's request to the Consular Body for authorization to manage prices in the International Settlement will have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, all members of the Consular Body must thoroughly study this matter. Some consuls may need to report to their embassies or national governments before they can reply. In any case, the clause drafted by the SMC and submitted to the Consular Body for approval must be studied by the consular court here in order to determine whether it will affect treaty rights in China.

Retailers Actually Restricting Sales

Since the speculative markets for various daily necessities, such as cloth, gold, and cotton yarn, have soared, the threat to the lives of citizens has become increasingly serious. In addition to the sharp increase in selling prices, there is also a situation of restricting purchases. Yesterday, a reporter witnessed a sauce shop limiting each person to a maximum purchase of one catty of cooking oil, refusing to sell more. Also, a cigarette paper shop only allowed the purchase of four bars of soap. In fact, the supply of these items is not lacking, and it is purely a matter of these stores hoarding goods in order to achieve their manipulative aims. The citizens are unaware of this and are becoming alarmed. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that the concession authorities will severely punish them.

### Argentine Merchant Ship Arrives with 30,000 Bales of Cotton

The Argentine merchant ship S.S. Norte, after being delayed in coming to Shanghai, is now expected to arrive at this port from Saitu Port on the morning of the 25th (today). After entering the port, it will berth at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. The ship is carrying 30,000 bales of cotton, all of which will be unloaded in Shanghai.

### British Residents Donate to the Soviet Red Cross

After a meeting of the executive committee of the Shanghai British Central War Fund, a check for 75,000 yuan in Chinese currency was delivered to the manager of the Shanghai Moscow National Bank for remittance to the General Association of the Soviet Red Cross. The bank manager accepted the check and expressed his deep gratitude to the British residents in Shanghai and their friends for their donations.

### Most Rice Shops in the French Concession Refuse to Sell Flat-Priced Rice

Some Rice Shops Only Sell a Maximum of Five Dou, Raising Prices and Hoarding in the Market to Wait for Higher Prices

The flat-priced foreign rice procured by the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) and distributed by various rice shops in this city has benefited the common people. However, some rice merchants who are blinded by profit have either mixed it with other rice for sale or sold it in short measures, deceiving the citizens. The police authorities have discovered and punished them according to law. Until recently, as rice prices have risen frequently, these rice merchants have been whimsical and dared to violate the law, selling the flat-priced foreign rice at high prices in the market in an attempt to obtain illegal profits. This has now been confirmed in various cases. A reporter also learned from various sources that most rice shops in the French Concession refused to sell the flat-priced rice to residents, claiming that it had already been sold out. Yesterday (the 23rd), a certain resident prepared funds to buy flat-priced rice, but was refused a supply. Some rice shops agreed to sell, but limited the sale to five dou. The authorities' distribution of flat-priced rice is intended to relieve the hardship of ordinary people, and will not allow any illegal merchants to monopolize and hide the rice, harming people's livelihoods. It is hoped that the French authorities will pay attention to this.

### The Originally Scheduled President Ship to Sail to Shanghai is Temporarily Recalled - This Suspension is Not Permanent

According to the situation yesterday (the 24th), it seems uncertain whether the ships of the American President Lines will arrive in Shanghai in the future. It is said that at least five President ships were expected to arrive in Shanghai between now and November 15, but they will not arrive at this port according to the usual schedule.

The General Ship Will Not Come to Shanghai

These five ships are the President Tyler, President Van Buren, and President Madison, as well as the General Pershing and General Holbrook. These two General ships were formerly the President Cleveland and President Taft and have now been converted into U.S. Army transport ships. It is said that this time they are only sailing to Manila, and the remaining three ships, which were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai, will not come.

Three President Ships Have Been Recalled

Among them, the President Tyler, on its return journey from Singapore, originally intended to come to Shanghai to return to the United States. It is now learned that after arriving in Hong Kong, it will return to the United States. The whereabouts of President Van Buren and President Madison are currently unknown. An employee of the President Lines here said that they had telegraphed the President Lines in Manila to inquire about the details of the two President ships being recalled. However, Manila replied that the information was also unknown. It was learned that President Madison was recalled after sailing 1,400 miles into the sea from Honolulu. The ship was carrying 100 overseas Chinese who had been expelled from Panama before the recent coup, and all intended to come to Shanghai. It is also said that President Van Buren and President Madison were originally scheduled to carry a large number of passengers, cargo, and mail to Shanghai, but have now also been recalled by the authorities. Also, the President Harrison has sailed from San Francisco to the Far East, but it is unknown whether it will sail to Shanghai. According to official sources this morning,

The Suspension is Only Temporary

The current suspension of American ships to Shanghai is only temporary and will last until November 15. It is impossible to say whether it will resume after that. It is also said that the U.S. government has designated Shanghai as part of the occupied area, and all American goods shipped to Shanghai must obtain a special license. However, the inventory of American goods in Shanghai is extremely abundant, and the goods are still being shipped in an endless stream, even though special licenses are required. When shipping is unblocked, there will be continued supply.

### This Year's Overseas Remittances Have Exceeded 800 Million

In order to encourage overseas Chinese to invest heavily in national construction, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Overseas Department of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission have jointly organized the Overseas Chinese Investment Guidance Committee. Overseas Chinese remittances should be handled centrally by the Central Bank. Overseas Chinese remittances handled by various banks should be resold to the Central Bank to facilitate remittance policy. The funds invested by overseas Chinese in national construction will be guaranteed by the government for the safety of their principal and interest, and will be rewarded, such as exemption from donations and taxes. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the National Bank yesterday that overseas Chinese remittances to Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Guangzhou, Fujian and other places from overseas Chinese to invest in industries and open factories have exceeded 800 million yuan this year. It is expected that it will exceed 1 billion yuan by the end of this year. Moreover, all donations, etc., are not included, which is a great contribution to the country.

### Export Licenses Required for Goods Shipped to Burma - Apply to the British Consulate

The British Embassy in China recently issued a statement stating that commercial goods shipped from Shanghai to Burma will be subject to new regulations starting from November 1st. Exported to Burma of goods, all vessels, loading of dyed cotton fabrics, dyeing raw materials, chemicals, pigments, Western medicine and medicinal materials, as well as belonging to medicinal village items, paints and colors, must obtain a license. This license can be applied for from the British Consul General in Shanghai. However, the new regulations do not apply before November 1st and goods can still be freely shipped.

### YMCA Appeals for Donations of Winter Clothing for the Poor - Target of 30,000 Yuan

In recent years, due to the impact of rising prices, the number of poor people starving and freezing to death in winter has increased year by year. Since the YMCA organized a campaign to solicit winter clothing for the poor last year, it has decided to continue to hold a fundraising campaign for winter clothing for the poor due to the above reasons, with a target of 30,000 yuan. Yesterday, the YMCA sent letters to all sectors stating that winter is approaching, and the suffering of the poor women and children who are suffering from hunger and cold is deeply regrettable. The YMCA is soliciting winter clothing donations of 30,000 yuan, as well as a large number of clothes and bedding. It is hoped that benevolent men and women from all walks of life will donate generously, and the merits will be immeasurable. (No external fundraising, and a formal receipt will be issued for each item received.) The receiving address is the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge.

Ningbo Provides Congee

After the fall of Ningbo, the Buddhist Benevolent Society, believing that the starving and cold were lamentable, decided to raise funds and provide congee after a meeting. It entrusted the Jin Cheng Bank, Si Ming Bank, and Guonen Temple at Eight Immortals Bridge to collect donations. Once a certain amount has been collected, personnel will be sent to Ningbo to start the process.

Help the Salvation Army

Someone recently visited the Salvation Army and learned that it has no fixed assets in Shanghai, so they donated 10,000 yuan in foreign currency. They deeply hope that wealthy Chinese can provide practical assistance and make contributions. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency quoted Major Hawke, the leader of the army, as saying yesterday that they do not intend to promote a donation movement. If anyone is willing to donate land, property, or money, they will plan to build a house so that all Salvation Army affairs can be promoted.

### The Asia Oil Depot in Changsha Was Bombed and Destroyed - There Was No Oil Stored in the Depot

The Zi Lin Bao reported yesterday (the 23rd) that according to visitors from Changsha, the Asia Oil Company's oil depot in Changsha was bombed by Japanese aircraft. When they left Changsha at the end of September, Japanese troops had not yet invaded the city, but had launched a fierce air raid. They witnessed Japanese aircraft dive-bombing the Asia Oil Depot. The oil depot was in a remote location across the river. Because there was no oil stored in it, it had not been used for a long time. The Japanese aircraft dropped a large bomb that landed between the oil tanks. One oil tank was destroyed, and three were heavily damaged. Four bombs hit the warehouse and burned it down. The oil depot's power supply was also destroyed, and several other buildings and equipment of the Asia Company were also slightly damaged.

### French Tram Workers Demand a Wage Increase

It is learned that the French Tram Workers' Union requested the company on the 23rd of this month to increase wages by $50 across the board, with $20 for housing and $30 for living allowances. The monthly salary of the company's coolies has already exceeded $135. Moreover, wage increases often stimulate price increases. The best solution is for the concession authorities to suppress general prices, which can reduce all labor disputes.

### Rampant Pirates at the Mouth of the Song River: Victims Rescued by Foreign Ship Captain Arrive in Shanghai; Twelve Ships Have Been Affected in the Past Few Months

Pirates are rampant near Wusong, specializing in robbing fishing boats and merchant ships, making it their source of livelihood. In the past month, more than twelve ships have been affected. Recently, similar incidents have occurred again. According to a foreign ship captain, he rescued dozens of merchants and passengers who had been subjected to the pirates' violence on his way from the mouth of the Song River to Shanghai. He said that when his ship reached sixty nautical miles from the mouth of the Song River, he heard cries for help. Although he did not understand Chinese, he knew that the passengers were in danger based on the situation. At that time, a group of pirates were threatening a small merchant ship not far from Wusong. The affected passengers cried for help to his ship, asking it to stop moving forward. Dozens of passengers, half-naked, jumped from the small boat, shouting loudly. The captain, disregarding the consequences, and seeing that the ship was damaged and without oars, threw ropes, allowing them to climb aboard. Then he brought them to Shanghai, and tied the small boat to the foreign ship. According to the captain, he wanted to cut the ropes and not bring the small boat, but after the passengers' cries, he carried some passengers on the small boat, and the sailors also came along. When they arrived in Wusong, many thanked the captain for his chivalry. Because of the captain's rescue, none of the passengers on the small boat were killed, only silver, money, and goods were lost, and the small boat was slightly damaged.

### The Owner of Yuchang Cotton Shop Arrested for Privately Hiding a Handgun

Confiscated from a Patrolman of the Public Concession. Shop owner Ye Bingsheng has been arrested pending investigation.

Yuchang Cotton Shop, Room 529, 5th Floor, Central Bank Building, Edward Road, is owned by Ye Bingsheng (44 years old this year) from Jiangyin. On the surface, it operates a legitimate cotton business, but in reality, it specializes in buying stolen goods of various kinds. Yesterday at 1:00 AM, the French police received a tip-off that the shop was hiding firearms. They immediately dispatched detectives to search the premises and found a handgun in the writing desk drawer. They immediately took the gun and the shop owner Ye Bingsheng into custody for questioning. It was later found that the handgun privately hidden by Ye was the official handgun of a patrolman in the Public Concession who had been robbed. Because Ye was suspected and the case was serious and the inside situation was complicated, the French police informed the Public Concession Police Department at 10:00 AM, and detectives from the Old Zha police station brought Ye and the handgun back.

### Extortion of 50,000 Yuan: Arrest and Trial Concluded

Huang Taisheng, who resides at No. 300, Shanhai Pass Road, has been studying in Hong Kong. Only his sister, Huang Suzhen, remains at home in Shanghai. From the 23rd of last month to the 9th of this month, Huang successively received six extortion letters, impersonating the name of a certain troop, signed by Zhao Hanming, stating that due to lack of funds, he specially requested a loan of 50,000 yuan. A bullet was attached to the letter, instructing him to make contact next to the Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower on Ximen Road in the South City. The person making contact would be carrying a beer bottle. Huang immediately reported the situation to the News Police Station, and dispatched Chinese Detective Wang Runhe and Detective Chen Baozhong. On the 9th of this month, they, together with local military police, went to wait and caught Xu Ziming (also known as He De) from Suzhou. They took him to the command headquarters and transferred him to the police station the day before yesterday. They searched Xu Ziming's home and found two bottles of ink and an inkpad, and ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that the defendant confessed in the police station that the case was initiated by Zhang Haiming, who is at large, and that the six extortion letters were written by the defendant alone. When Xu Ziming was questioned, he confessed everything. Judge Zhong verified the confession and ordered him to be detained until the 29th, when the verdict would be announced at a later date.

### Ministry of Finance Issues High-Denomination Revenue Stamps

The various revenue stamps previously issued by the Ministry of Finance had low face values.

### Letter

To the Editor: According to the statement of the person concerned, Weng Yuquan, I have read the news item "Pawnshop Owner Embezzles Pledgor's Jewelry" in the local news column of the Shenbao on the 23rd of this month. The details recorded therein are completely inconsistent with the facts. According to Zeng Kefu, the gold ring in dispute had a small amount of the outer layer of the joint cut off, and it was mentioned that it had been sold to a jewelry store. The news item stated that Yuquan "actually cut off a small amount of the inner layer of the joint (old style) of the gold ring and sold it to a jewelry store." This record is obviously unfounded. As the case has already been litigated, the right and wrong can originally be quietly awaited the court's decision. However, for fear of confusing the public, I should entrust you to forward it to the newspaper for correction. Accordingly, I am forwarding it on behalf of the person concerned, and I hope you will investigate and correct it. Sincerely, To the Editor of Shenbao, Lawyer Shen E, October 24.

### Thefts in Shanghai (Part 2)

— Bai Min

Criminals occasionally carry large quantities of stolen goods to the interior for sale. If the police receive news of the sale of stolen goods in the interior, they immediately send a detective to cooperate with local police officers to arrest the criminals and those who receive the stolen goods. Before the war, criminals often gathered in Hongkou. After a robbery, they would cross the bridge to Hongkou or Zhabei to sell the stolen goods. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, pawnshops and receivers of stolen goods moved to the south of the Suzhou Creek, and the center for selling stolen goods also moved south.

The police often use the method of detectives posing as receivers of stolen goods to catch the criminals who sell the stolen goods on the spot. When a detective posing as a receiver of stolen goods is working, he first sets a date with a third party who is close to the criminals' activities. If the criminal arrives on time, he will be arrested by other detectives disguised as workers and lurking nearby. When the trial begins, the criminal has no way to deny it and has to confess, suffering the taste of prison. However, clever criminals often guard against falling into this trap, so they first send a representative, without carrying the stolen goods, to the scene alone. The detective has no way to start and can only pretend to negotiate, while quietly waiting for the opportunity to mature. Only when the criminal believes that it is safe and shows the stolen goods will the detectives act to wipe out the gang of criminals.

Some criminals' activities are quite similar to those of Western criminal gangs. They often belong to a criminal gang and use third parties to sell stolen goods, giving them a commission after the transaction is completed. Sometimes criminals hide the stolen goods for many months, thinking that the police investigation has slackened, before contacting the receivers of stolen goods or pawnshops to sell the stolen goods. However, most of them are still solved, because when a detective is assigned to investigate a case, he always pays attention. Even after many months or even years, he can still arrest the criminals and bring them to justice.

The rampant theft in Shanghai is also related to the carelessness of most citizens. Few citizens remember the correct value and detailed characteristics of the stolen property to help the police conduct investigations. Failure to report a robbery is also an important reason for the frequent occurrence of robberies. The close cooperation between the Public Concession Police Department and the French Concession Police Department in investigating and arresting criminals has achieved good results. Whenever a robbery occurs, as long as there are sufficient clues, it is not difficult to solve it in a short period of time.

### Two More Bombs Were Thrown at the Grain Exchange Yesterday; Did Not Explode and Were Removed by the Police

The Grain and Oil Cake Exchange at No. 15 Edward Road, French Concession, had a young man pretend to bend down to tie his shoelaces in front of the gate on the 4th of this month, then placed two paper-wrapped hand grenades and walked away. There was also a letter attached. Fortunately, it was discovered early and did not explode. Unexpectedly, not long after, at about 4:30 PM yesterday, another man in his thirties, wearing a black long gown, carried two rectangular paper packages. When passing in front of the gate, he suddenly threw the two paper packages into the iron gate. They did not explode. The janitors and guards of the exchange saw it and knew that something was wrong. They expected that there must be dangerous items inside and did not dare to go forward to inspect them. At that time, the exchange inside the building was still noisy with buying and selling, disturbing the ears. Upon hearing the news, they immediately ceased operations and quickly called the French police. A large number of detectives rushed to the scene and immediately dispersed the crowd in the area, trying to open the two paper packages. It turned out that they were two hand grenades, and another letter was attached. They were all taken back to the police station for investigation.

### Assassin of White Russian Society Chairman Arrested

The English-language North China Daily News reports that the Japanese have arrested a Chinese in the South City and confiscated a handgun, the model of which is the same as the gun used to assassinate Ivanoff, the former chairman of the White Russian Committee in this city, and to assassinate Japanese soldiers in Hongkou in recent months. The case is currently being handled jointly by Major Hayashi of the Japanese Military Police and the Public Concession Police Department. It is reported that the arrested Chinese was caught by nearby Japanese sentries in the South City two days ago when he tried to assassinate someone. The confiscated handgun and bullets are the same as those found in the assassination of Ivanoff on September 25 and the assassination of Japanese sentry Nishida in July. It is widely believed that the arrested Chinese has confessed to terrorist activities. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese and the Public Concession authorities will soon carry out a large-scale arrest.

### Two Women Detained in Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre

At about 2:30 AM yesterday, the Japanese sent a plainclothes team to the French police station, requesting to cooperate in dispatching additional personnel to arrest two Guangdong women, Ms. Guo and Ms. Cui, at No. 68 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre, one in her fifties and the other in her thirties. They searched their room for more than an hour, and a large number of photos and letters were taken away. It is reported that Ms. Cui does not live here and only lodged at Ms. Guo's place two days ago. The cause of this incident may be related to the arrest of a Cantonese man surnamed Wang at No. 19 Dunhe Lane, Route Tenant de la Tour, by the Japanese and French police at about 8:30 PM the day before yesterday.

### Yuchengtaili Rice Shop Arrests Four or Five People for Altering the Public Works Department’s Low-Priced Rice and Selling it at High Prices to Defraud Money

The price of rice in this city's rice market has soared due to the manipulation and monopoly of rice merchants and hoarders, putting an unbearable burden on the common people. Fortunately, the Public Works Department has taken appropriate measures to severely punish rice weevils and directly purchase foreign rice for sale at low prices. The price of rice was once stabilized. However, the rice weevils only know how to enrich themselves and disregard the hardships of the people. They do not hesitate to use various methods to undermine the authorities' good policies. Recently, some people have been hiding the low-priced foreign rice they obtained from the Public Works Department without selling it, and privately altering it to sell at high prices, while making false reports to the Public Works Department, falsely claiming that the rice they obtained has been completely sold. This kind of behavior that eats people without spitting out their bones is truly outrageous. The Old Zha police station recently discovered that Yuchengtaili Rice Shop at No. 8 Fujian Road (Zhengjia Wood Bridge), has been altering the appearance of the Public Works Department's low-priced rice and selling it at high prices. Therefore, Chinese Detective Ji Peijin went to search the premises the day before yesterday morning and took the person in charge, Mr. Lu, and four or five others into custody for questioning. However, they were not sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. It is reported that the police authorities are currently conducting a thorough and detailed investigation into the case. Once the evidence is collected, they will file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court according to the law.

### Unveiling of the Free Talk Essay Contest, Part 6: One Knows the Difficulty Only After Experiencing It - Lin - A Lesson I Learned -

In these days of rice as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, we barely managed to hire a nanny. Besides buying groceries and cooking, she also had to wash the clothes of five people. These tasks were already enough to overwhelm her, so there was no time for her to tidy up the rooms. As a result, dust accumulated more and more in our rooms. Spiderwebs covered the ceiling, the glass windows were so dirty that almost no light could pass through, and the walls were covered with patches. I really couldn't stand it anymore and asked myself, "Are these things only for the nanny to do? I also have two hands, why don't I do it myself?" Fortunately, it's summer vacation now, and I have a lot of time to work. Good! I decided to do it myself.

My first step was to prepare to whitewash the ceiling. So, I went to the street to buy a package of "Lao Fen" (a type of whitewash powder) and mixed it with water. Who knew that after a while, the "Lao Fen" would quickly settle, and the water and powder would separate clearly. I knew that it wouldn't be that simple to succeed. So I went to a "whitewashing workshop" to inquire and learned that it wouldn't work without adding glue. I bought some glue there. I tried it at home, and it was indeed effective. The water and powder mixed evenly, and I couldn't see any more settling. At that time, I was very happy, thinking that I would be able to proceed smoothly. Who knew that the first stroke with the powder would cause a problem. Not only did it not whiten, but it even became darker with each stroke. It turned out that I had forgotten to wipe off the dust first. The white powder, of course, wouldn't whiten when it encountered dust. Helpless, I had to go to the street again to buy a new broom to brush off the dust and cobwebs. This time, I wasn't fooled. If I used an old broom, wouldn't I just be adding another layer of dirt? With great difficulty, the ceiling was whitewashed, but I was covered in sweat. My face and body seemed to have been whitewashed as well. I couldn't help but laugh when I looked in the mirror. It turned out I looked like a "little painted face" on the stage. This success, although it suffered some setbacks, aroused my interest and courage in future work.

The second step was to prepare to wipe the glass windows and walls. It seemed easy, but the glass that hadn't been wiped for a long time made me work hard. Climbing up and down the ladder with a wiping cloth, carrying a lead bucket to change the water again and again, using a dry cloth for a while and a wet cloth for a while, I was having a great time. It took a lot of effort to wipe all fifty-eight panes of glass clean in one go.

The third step was to prepare to paint the floor. I ran to the "paint shop" to ask how to paint it well. How is paint made? Of course, when asking, you can't look arrogant, you have to be humble. Very smoothly, the painter very politely told me everything and taught me to buy some shellac (solid) in the paint shop, then soak it in alcohol until it dissolves. I thanked him and went to buy four jiao worth of shellac for experimentation. When I got home, I poured some kerosene and put the shellac inside. Who knew that after waiting for a long time, the kerosene was still kerosene, and the shellac was still shellac. The hateful shellac showed no sign of dissolving at all. Just when I was puzzled, my father came over and scolded me slightly. "What a mess you've made on the floor." Uncle Xiang also came over and said, "You can't paint the floor yourself, you'll only make a mess." I had nothing to say because what I was doing wasn't working! At that time, I didn't want to stop my work. I believed that the amiable painter would never deceive me. So I went to the paint shop for the second time to ask the reason for not dissolving. After the painter's instructions, I suddenly realized that I had mistaken kerosene for alcohol. No wonder it wouldn't dissolve. What a waste. This time, I reorganized my troops, with the determination to succeed, I bought enough raw materials, and finally whitewashed my old room, making it look brand new. My father and Uncle Xiang also came to see it. At this time, they had nothing to say.

From this experience, I learned three lessons:

(1) Don't be ashamed to ask questions - Things that I didn't understand at all, I was able to do myself after asking people. One person's knowledge is limited, and one must not be arrogant. You must humbly ask for advice in order to make up for your own shortcomings with the strengths of others.

(2) The spirit of perseverance - The success of a thing is not achieved at once, it often goes through many setbacks. For example, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's leadership of the revolution succeeded only on the tenth attempt. If he had stopped after the first or third failure and resigned himself to failure, where would we be today? Therefore, the spirit of perseverance is a major factor in success.

(3) One knows the difficulty only after experiencing it - Often many things seem easy, but after you do them yourself, you realize that they are difficult. I believe in the saying "One knows the difficulty only after experiencing it."

Natural Natural World's Offense and Defense - Sun Hong -

Many offensive and defensive methods in modern warfare are not surprising, because Mother Nature has already come up with those methods for various animals.

Artillery - A kind of beetle carries a cannon with it, a special scent gland inside its abdomen. When they fire the cannon, they emit a terrible stench and a rumbling sound. It is enough to scare their enemies - reptiles and birds that live by preying - into abandoning their armor and fleeing.

Air Defense Network - According to recent reports, Britain has invented a shell that can shoot out metal filaments after it explodes, hooking onto the propellers of enemy aircraft. A primitive animal in ponds uses the same method to protect itself. When they escape, they release "hook glands," making it impossible for enemies to move.

Smoke Bomb - When cuttlefish are foraging on the ocean surface, if they find an enemy lurking in the dark, they shoot out a black liquid as a smokescreen to cover their retreat. Under the cover of that smokescreen, they escape home and come out again when there is no danger.

Camouflage - There are countless animals in nature that can use camouflage. The tactics of spider crabs are the most ingenious. They collect seaweed, chew it to make it easier to grow, and then attach it to the curved short hairs on their backs. The seaweed then takes root there, effectively concealing the cunning crab.

Parachute - Spiders in our forests or grasslands climb onto a tree and spit out a long, wandering thread. When a breeze blows the thread, it leaves the tree and climbs onto the thread, drifting with the thread. After drifting to the distance it desires, it folds up its parachute and slowly lands.

Air Combat - Fighter planes can repel bombers because of their high speed and ease of use. Hummingbirds, which are native to tropical America, can also use the same method to repel enemies. When giant eagles or other plunderers come to seize their nests, they aim their spear-like beaks at the eyes of the opponent and swoop down to drive away the enemy.

Inventing Eye Masks and Paper Slippers - Yong Yun -

To increase passenger comfort, Northwest Airlines in the United States has recently provided an eye mask. Because after wearing the eye mask, it can avoid bright light stimulating the eyes. This way, you can take a nap, while another passenger sitting next to you can still read, which is convenient for both.

There is also a kind of paper slippers. These slippers are made of a very soft paper, which is cool and light to wear on the feet, which is really a great benefit to passengers.

Fourteen: The Life of a Fallen Hero

"Originally, there was war and chaos at this time, and many shops in Shanghai were closed. Where could you go to a foreign firm to find a job?" The landlady of the small inn, knowing about this, came into Qiu Haitang's room that night and launched into a long speech. "But there are also places where girls can easily find a good match, as long as you open your minds a little and don't take the old sayings that people used to say too seriously. You have to know what kind of world it is now?"

Mei Bao lowered her head, sitting on a fake mahogany chair that had lost its bamboo shoots, silently not saying a word.

"Thank you for your kindness, Madam. We are outsiders in this world, and we must ask you to guide us in everything!" Qiu Haitang replied in a diplomatic tone, but in his heart, he was planning how to go again tomorrow to find a few more acquaintances.

This time, his vision was finally correct. He found Mr. Qian, who worked as an editor in a newspaper. Although this Mr. Qian didn't have such a deep friendship with Qiu Haitang before, he was very generous and always willing to help others. After listening to Qiu Haitang say three or four sentences, he immediately jumped up from his seat, took down the old Qiu Pai cigar that he was holding in his mouth, and said with great excitement:

"Then what else is there to say? Of course, we have to quickly find a way to get a class!"

Qiu Haitang was about to interject, but the old Mr. Qian hurriedly waved his hand to stop him. (245)

Movie Stars Teach Tirelessly - Li Yi -

Some people think that the big stars in Hollywood probably have very big egos! This idea is actually wrong. Many big stars not only humbly accept other people's guidance, but also sincerely teach people. Many of these big stars are actually teachers! No wonder they have the spirit of teaching tirelessly!

Ms. Ann Sheridan, now a first-class star, taught English, mathematics and Spanish at a school in the north for six years before entering the film city. Students deeply loved her. Madeleine Carroll and the red-haired girl Greer Garson were both teachers in England before going to Hollywood in the United States. Their spirit of patient guidance was undoubtedly very popular with students. Rita Hayworth, this brilliant star from Columbia, used to be a dance teacher at a technical school in Hollywood. Her dance skills were already appreciated! Myrna Loy originally ran a dance night school in Culver City for a long time. Many people became famous under her tutelage! Paramount has a star, Louise Campbell, who is a very serious teacher! She said that teaching is the most interesting, and she still wants to be a teacher if she has the opportunity. If a person is lucky enough to have such a beautiful star as their teacher, what an honor it would be! Then the rapid progress of learning is naturally also to be expected!

(6) Wang Yurong

Wang Yurong, people say that she started as a song girl in Qinhuai, which is not true. Before she went to Nanjing, she had already used the stage name "Wang Yanfang" and sang in the Shanghai stage for a while, but before she went north to worship Wang Yaoqing, she once showed her beauty in the Qunfang Club in Moling. Yurong's voice is very good - unlike other female roles, who have a thin, sharp, and shrill "ghost voice" - and can be called an excellent choice in today's Kun Ling team. She can also persevere and encourage herself, so she has received a lot of guidance from Wang Yaoqing. In a few years, her art has improved rapidly. However, her Beijing dialect is still not as pure as Zhang Eyun's, which is a shortcoming, but when compared to singing skills, Zhang is slightly inferior to her. - Wang Yaoqing once said to me personally: Although his female disciples are all over the north and south, most of them became famous and then joined his school, so many singing styles, because of the preconceived notions, are difficult to erase, and sometimes they cannot be forced to conform in order to fully conform to Yaoqing's style. Only Wang Yurong learned opera from him, and she has not yet achieved much success, so she can be dedicated and unremitting, and not pursue other things. Compared with other Kun Ling, Wang Yurong can be said to still have one or two points of Yaoqing's true face. From Wang Yaoqing's words, it can also be inferred that Wang Yurong has gained from Yaoqing.

Shanghai's Newest Type of Bookstore - Jian Fan -

The arrangement of bookstores in the Shanghai concessions, such as Huiquanlou, Nanyuan, Huyuan, Yalu, Fuchun, Longquan, Yuminglou, and Fengmingtai, is as simple as the old-fashioned bookstores in the Yemiao area in Nanshi City. For more than ten years, bookstores attached to hotels have sprung up one after another. Only the Oriental Bookstore, which still stands tall, has relatively complete facilities. Nowadays, the Oriental's night show specializes in drama and has been rebuilt into a small theater. Secondly, such as Da Luotian, Nanjing Bookstore, and Baihuating Night Bookstore, which is attached to the new type of teahouse, the seating arrangement in the venue is also very good. Since the Cangzhou Hotel's hall was opened as a bookstore this summer, all the facilities are magnificent and luxurious. The listener feels refreshed when they are in it. However, the Zhangyuan Bookstore, which recently opened, is located in the Coral Hall upstairs, which is beautiful and more complete than Cangzhou. The front and rear glass windows have sufficient light. And like a broadcasting station, there is a cloth cover under the roof to concentrate the sound waves, and a sound amplifier is installed on the desk, so that even the listeners sitting in the last row can hear clearly. It can be said that it fully meets the new type of bookstore in our dreams.

All the storytelling and ballad singing hired by the newly opened bookstores are called "Qinglong Dang" by people in this industry. Zhangyuan's "Qinglong Dang", such as Shen Jian'an and Li Nian'an's Pearl Tower, and Wu Zi'an's Dangerous Tang, I have already talked about in this journal's "Autumn Dang Warriors of Each Bookstore". As for the younger ballad singers Pang Xueting and Xie Hanting's Fallen Golden Fan, both of them are disciples of Jiang Ruting and have considerable accomplishments, as well as Run Yu She's Zhang Jianting and Jianbang's Ten Beauties, are all worth listening to. In the night show, such as Hou Jiuxia and Shen Huiren's Pearl Tower, their singing voice is round and jade-like, and their storytelling is affectionate and reasonable. Liu Tianyun and Xie Yuqing's master and apprentice's Three Smiles, their explanations are delicate and appropriate. Yun Feng's commentary on the Golden Spear Legend is concise and old-fashioned. The last show to send off guests, Lu Fengxiang and Xiao Xiang's father and son's Yu Qiting, is humorous and funny. Isn't it comfortable and interesting to sit in such an elegant and exquisite bookstore for a low price?

Chapter 18: Vow to Sweep Away the Huns Regardless of Oneself

So Bai Twelve, on orders, went to Jiukoumen and invited Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei, and also invited Xu Jingliu and Ying, to a secret place, which Bai Twelve had specially arranged, and set up a very rich banquet with the best wine, inviting the four to drink happily. Zhang Cangqiu was a little puzzled to see that Bai Twelve was receiving them so sincerely today. After three rounds of wine, Bai Twelve told the four of Wu Sangui's urgent desire to invite Zhang and others to Beijing to rescue Yuan Yuan, and asked Zhang Cangqiu and others on behalf of Sangui. Xu Jing listened and couldn't help laughing: "Heroes are helpless with affection! When King Chu Shuang was surrounded at Gaixia, he still had to abandon the country, but couldn't let go of Consort Yu. The Gaixia song brought tears to the ages, which cannot be explained. I heard that Chen Yuanyuan is indeed the number one beauty in Jiangnan. General Wu got her, and naturally they are a loving couple, enjoying exclusive favor. Unfortunately, she was taken away by the rebel thief, no wonder the general deeply regrets and hates it, and is reluctant to let go. Returning the pearl to Hepu and the sword leaping in Yanjin, of course, this is what General Wu deeply hopes for. However, it is known that the king has just died, the Divine Land has been lost, and the Ming Dynasty is in a precarious and critical autumn. What should a soldier do to be ready for battle and save the country? When national affairs and private feelings are compared, someone must be able to distinguish the weight and urgency. Now General Wu doesn't hurry to rectify the three armies to fight the bandits, but instead keeps thinking about a woman, isn't it too trivial?" Liu Yinying smiled and said nothing, Zhang Cangqiu shouted: "Brother Bai, it's not that I'm unwilling to comply with your request, but I can't agree to do it in the first place. (201)
