### Roosevelt Delivers Important Speech: US May Be Drawn into War; Pacific Fleet Completes Combat Readiness; Britain and America Closely Monitor German Enticement of Japan to Advance South

Washington – President Roosevelt declared yesterday in an executive press conference that if the United States were to engage in war in the Pacific, the return of Wilkie, who had been transporting American military supplies to Britain, would not be affected. When a reporter asked the President when he would accept the credentials of the new Japanese Ambassador to the United States, the President replied that Ambassador Nomura would visit the White House on Wednesday or Thursday. A reporter asked, "Does the President also believe that there is a risk of war in the Pacific?" The President replied, "No," but declined to elaborate further. (United Press International dispatch, 12th)

Washington – Wilkie began a conversation with President Roosevelt after 10:00 PM last night, lasting ninety minutes. Afterwards, he told reporters, "We discussed many things, and we also discussed national defense production." When a reporter asked about rumors that Wilkie might decline a position in defense production, he replied, "Absolutely not." He further stated that his conversation with Roosevelt was very sincere and smooth. (United Press International dispatch, 12th)

Washington – President Roosevelt, in an executive press conference yesterday, answered a question that many people have had in their minds for a long time with a very thoughtful attitude, stating that even if the United States were forced to join the war in the Far East, the supply of war materials to Britain would not be affected in the slightest. The President continued with a firm attitude, unwilling to answer speculative follow-up questions in detail, but judging from his answers to these follow-up questions, the United States Navy in the Pacific has the full ability to defend itself and engage in naval battles. American industry is also able to continue to produce goods. Regarding the Japanese Ambassador Nomura, when a reporter asked when Nomura would present his credentials, the President replied that he believed that he could present his credentials today (i.e., Wednesday) and said, "He is an old friend of mine, as you all know." Although official circles have not expressed anything, the general public believes that the President may intend to explain the position of the United States to his old friend in a clear and resolute manner. Coupled with the failure of the Axis powers in Europe and the psychological and strategic progress of Britain's position in the war, this clear explanation from the President should influence even the most frivolous and arrogant elements in Tokyo. At the same time, the fact that British bombers are flying from Singapore to northern Malaya is also a matter of great concern to Washington. The Japanese side points out that this is a kind of nervous reaction by the British authorities to defend Singapore in preparation for future disasters. However, many people believe that this statement by the Japanese side appropriately expresses the nervous anxiety that Tokyo already has. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

Washington – Roosevelt's speech yesterday regarding the possibility of the United States being drawn into war in the Far East is considered by diplomatic observers here to be the most important statement he has made in recent weeks. Although the President warned reporters not to speculate wildly, general observers acknowledge that the President's words have their own importance. In answering inquiries, the President stated that if the United States were to engage in war in the Pacific, the export of American military supplies to Britain would still not be affected. Observers consider this statement noteworthy for the following reasons: (1) American factories and shipyards will still be able to continue working hard to produce military supplies for Britain when the United States participates in the war in the Far East. (2) Based on the above reasons, many believe that the United States will believe that it can conduct the war in the Far East entirely through the use of the Navy. (3) If the Navy is the main instrument of war in the Far East, then this war will undoubtedly be an economic war of blockade. (4) Many believe that President Roosevelt does not want the United States to be the leader in the war in the Far East unless Japan excessively infringes upon American interests in that area, and then he will take this step. Many believe that the President made this firm statement for two reasons: first, the question came from a reporter from a newspaper affiliated with Secretary of the Navy Knox; second, he wanted the newspaper to publish this statement to reach the ears of the leaders of the Japanese government, because the leaders of Japan are the ones who will decide whether Japan will attack Singapore or the Dutch East Indies at the same time that Germany attacks Britain. (United Press International dispatch, 12th)

London – Hitler is now trying hard to drag Japan into the war in order to relieve the pressure on the German side caused by the collapse of the United States. People in London are closely watching this. What the German side is plotting is a sudden invasion of Britain in the spring, while Japan invades the Dutch East Indies and Malaya, so as to contain the British fleet and resources. Many believe that Hitler, in order to induce Japan to pull chestnuts out of the fire for him, has promised Tokyo that he can persuade Moscow to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan, so that Japan can avoid worries about its rear when it begins operations in the South Seas. A small number of extremely pro-Axis elements in Japan will undoubtedly support Hitler, but people here believe that the sentiment among knowledgeable Japanese people against Japan continuing to take adventurous actions for the sake of the Nazis is becoming increasingly strong, because once the German side's own goals are achieved, it will disregard Japan's situation.

### Australian Bomber Squadron Increases Defense of Malaya

Singapore – It was officially announced today that several squadrons of Australian Air Force bombers have left Singapore for the northern part of Malaya to increase the defense of that area.

### Wilkie Asks All of America to Unite, Rapidly Implement the Lend-Lease Act, Testifies Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Isolation Will Destroy Freedom and Cause Economic Panic, Agrees That Aid Should Be Limited to Britain, China, and Greece

Washington – Former Republican presidential candidate Wilkie stated his views to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that Britain needs both immediate and long-term aid. The only way the United States can aid Britain is to implement the Lend-Lease Act with amendments. What he calls immediate aid is, for example, that the United States should supply Britain with five to ten destroyers per month. We should be able to handle this in a direct and rapid manner and should not engage in dubious lawyerly interpretations. If we want to provide Britain with more destroyers, we should equip them in our own shipyards. I advocate that the aid proposed by the United States should be limited to Britain, China, and Greece. I am certain that an isolationist policy will eventually destroy America's civil liberties and cause economic panic. Even if Britain obtains American aircraft, it will still take some time to gain air superiority. If American aid is insufficient, then Britain may fail. I also agree with the time limit added to the President's power by the House amendment. I believe that the amendment should aim to limit the unnecessary powers granted by this bill. I want to see the American people united before the world as enemies of those who strive to destroy democracy. For the sake of national unity, I urge those who oppose this bill to support it. If so, the agreement of the millions of people they represent will surely give the nation a united strength. This strength is greater than the strength of arms and warships. Although Britain has already obtained fifty American destroyers, it still needs more destroyers. British merchant ships now travel the high seas without adequate protection. Sometimes, only two destroyers protect thirty or forty merchant ships. Aiding Britain is not a solution to Britain's problems. If Britain wins, the enslaved democratic countries can still be revived. As for the long-term aid that Britain needs, it is aircraft and munitions, etc., which are currently being ordered in large quantities in the United States. We are speeding up production, but it will be many months before our efforts show significant results. Taking the aircraft program as an example, this program will not be able to immediately give Britain air superiority until 1942. Britain's greatest danger is the destruction of its merchant ships. When I toured England, I saw the destruction in the northern industrial areas, which was shocking, but the convenience of production was not greatly damaged. If the United States is content to remain isolated, then Britain's survival may be extremely difficult. At this time, no one can say whether Britain can win without the aid of American ships, armaments, and supplies. However, we know for certain that if Britain fails, the totalitarian powers will rule the world. They will not only dominate Europe but will also encompass a large part of Africa and will dominate the Atlantic. After that, Germany may extend its power economically or militarily to the Latin American nations, and Japan will also advance south to covet the Dutch East Indies. Thus, the United States and Canada will be under the pressure of the totalitarian powers. Friction will continue, and the United States will be forced to fight. At that time, we will be alone in the same battle that Britain is in today, but in a different situation. A member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked, "If Britain fails tomorrow and Germany obtains the British Navy, will the United States not be at war in one or two months?" Wilkie replied, "I believe that Germany will not succeed in invading Britain. British Prime Minister Churchill has said that Britain's greatest needs are destroyers, large bombers, and merchant ships." (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### US Army Families Evacuate the Philippines, Return to Country by Ship Within the Week

Manila – US military authorities announced today that approximately 400 family members of US military officers stationed in the Philippines will return to the United States by transport ships "Etolin" and "Grant" within a week, due to Washington's advocacy of evacuating overseas citizens. At the same time, the Philippine military announced that reserve officers have been called up to begin two weeks of rigorous training starting on February 17. At the same time, close attention is being paid to supervising the training of the Philippine military. Therefore, US military officers stationed here must be increased. The Army Air Corps here is also rapidly expanding. 5,000 specially selected Philippine reservists will participate in a year of training with the indigenous troops in the US military. In addition to the "Grant" and "Etolin," there are six other US transport ships currently en route to the Philippines. According to reliable sources, these ships may bring continuous supplies. When these six ships return to the United States, they will transport the evacuated US military families here. The officers whose families are returning to the United States in the first batch are those whose terms of service in the Philippines will end within the next six months. However, it is understood that subordinates have received orders to remain in the Philippines after their terms of service expire. The families of the US Navy have already evacuated the Philippines. Those who are evacuating this time are the first batch of Army families. In the past, Army authorities had declared that in the event of a crisis, Army families would remain on the Philippine Islands. (United Press International dispatch, 12th)

### The Issue of Full American Aid to Britain Has Reached a Critical Juncture: Decision on Whether US Ships Will Escort Merchant Vessels Is Imminent

New York – (Dispatch from News Editor Holster) The US government has today approached the most difficult point in the issue of full American aid to Britain. Within a few weeks, it must decide whether to use American warships to escort merchant vessels sailing on the dangerous seas. Britain has reached a point where it clearly needs the United States to decide quickly and give a direct answer. However, the US President cannot make any promises, and his advisors all believe that the use of American warships for escort is fundamentally unavoidable. These advisors report to the President that ships are more important than aircraft. If Britain does not have ships, it will be doomed. However, ships must have naval protection, and Britain does not have enough warships. What is urgently needed at present is at least 300 cargo ships, destroyers, and long-range surface aircraft. Government officials admit that the addition of warships to the service may inevitably trigger a German-American war. If German submarines sink US destroyers or German aircraft sink US cruisers, what other option does the United States have? Therefore, the question of how the US naval escort can be implemented has become a problem. The government authorities have proposed two methods: 1. The United States resumes its former policy of openly patrolling the coast to reduce the threat of attacks on neutral ships, thereby reducing the burden on British ships. 2. Utilize the US-Canada joint defense agreement to withdraw from Newfoundland into the Atlantic, 600 miles out, and have British ships take over. This move can avoid the threat of German aircraft. There are many obstacles to implementing the first method, such as a lack of bases and the inability of Central and South America to cooperate. The disadvantage of the second method is that although the escort distance can be shortened and accelerated, the actual number of ships needed by Britain cannot be reduced. Therefore, an alternative method is not as good as directly transferring destroyers to Britain. However, Secretary of the Navy Knox has stated that the United States can no longer transfer destroyers, otherwise it will weaken its own strength. Senior naval officials agree. In addition to warships, the lack of transport ships is even more important, because without these ships, the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of American armaments for aid to Britain cannot be sent to Britain. The current situation is unstable, approximately as follows: * The current American aid to Britain issue is focused on the fear that Britain will be "defeated" in March. The United States believes that at this time, one aircraft, one ship, or one warship is worth one hundred aircraft and one hundred warships in the future. * The United States is currently building 260 new ships, but none will be completed within a year. * Since June, Germany has sunk 100,000 tons of British ships every week. Even if the 260 American ships are completed overnight, their total of 1 million tons is only enough for Britain for five months. Therefore, the US government must overcome the difficulties of the public enemy escort issue before it can deliver the large quantities of armaments produced next year to Britain. The United States itself only has a slight surplus of armaments for training soldiers. Once this large-scale armament manufacturing is on track, it can be produced in large quantities, reaching hundreds of millions of American dollars per month, and Britain will receive most of it. (United Press International dispatch, 12th)

### Japanese Confiscate All Private Gold

Tokyo – "Hochi Shimbun" reported that the Tokyo Municipal Spiritual Mobilization Bureau recently decided to designate four days in March to persuade Tokyo residents to sell all their gold to the government. Gold buying stations will be set up in elementary schools and other places, and 300 women will be dispatched to the streets to collect gold. It is hoped that this method can collect all the remaining gold in Tokyo. Speakers said that it is most difficult to persuade wealthy households and government officials who wear gold-rimmed glasses and gold buttons to sell their gold. Civilians who have sold all their gold should be awarded medals. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Japan Establishes National Federation Yesterday

### Soviet Union Adopts New Methods to Improve Tea Cultivation

Moscow – The Soviet Union has a total tea cultivation area of 56,000 hectares, mostly in Georgia, but in recent years it has expanded to the Caspian Sea area and the subtropics. Each hectare can yield an average of 2,300 kilograms of tea leaves, but there are also records of yields of 11,000 kilograms per hectare. In 1940, the 38 Soviet tea factories produced a total of 13,000 tons of black tea, green tea, and tea bricks. Currently, the Tea Research Institute is conducting investigations to improve the tea industry. The machines invented by the institute can reduce the tea leaf ripening time from 20 hours to 6 hours. At the same time, it is also planned to improve the tea drying method to ensure that the tea leaves do not lose their fragrance. As for tea cultivation in the north, the institute has also invented new methods. (TASS dispatch, 11th)

Editorial

### Mr. Roosevelt's Important Statement

President Roosevelt of the United States, in answering reporters' questions at a press conference the day before yesterday, stated that even if the United States were forced to join the war in the Far East, the supply of war materials to Britain would not be affected in the slightest. Although this is a semi-official statement, its content is full of new significance. Not long ago, when Roosevelt called on Americans to aid democratic countries, his appealing argument was only that aiding China and Britain could enable the United States to avoid war. Now, he no longer shies away from the possibility that the United States may be forced to be drawn into the war. The so-called war clearly refers to the war in the Far East. This not only shows that the international situation in the past month or so has developed to another new stage, but also that the US authorities' determination to deal with the situation is no longer restricted by the fearful mentality of avoiding the spread of war at all costs.

As of the time of writing, the full text of Roosevelt's speech has not yet been transmitted to Shanghai, but the few words that have been transmitted have the force of a thunderbolt, enough to change the situation. First, the United States' fearlessness of challenges from aggressors, since the beginning of October last autumn, has not only been repeatedly expressed, but also seen in actual responses. The public mention of the possibility of joining the war actually began with Roosevelt's speech the day before yesterday. As Reuters explained, this clearly shows that "the United States Navy in the Pacific has the full ability to defend itself and engage in naval battles in the Pacific Ocean." Therefore, if the development of the situation in the Far East proves that peaceful means are not enough to stop aggression, it is expected that the United States will stand up and fight without hesitation. Second, due to its geographical location, dealing with attacks from both oceans at the same time has always been a difficult issue for US national defense. However, in the past half year, because of the recovery of Britain's combat position and the serious defeat of the Italian army in the Middle East and North Africa, the threat to the United States in the Atlantic has been greatly reduced. The US obligation to support Britain was originally only to fully supply war materials. The recent adjustments to and improvements in the US defense industry have enabled the fulfillment of this task to be unaffected by dealing with any crises in the Far East. On the other hand, this is a clear indication that even if the United States expands aid to Britain, it will not hinder the independent and firm implementation of its Far East policy. Although the completion of the US two-ocean navy is still far away, it is now able to fully and freely deal with the threats from both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and is prepared to deal with the worst-case scenario. The two magic weapons used by aggressor nations to achieve their desires, namely, intimidation through false declarations and piecemeal destruction, have long been seen through by various countries. Roosevelt's firm statement this time further proves that the magic weapons have already been broken.

The conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, no matter how its participants conceal and explain it, cannot deny its main intention of dealing with the United States. Targeting the United States' geographical weakness of spanning two oceans, it attempts to use the corresponding actions of allied countries to restrain it, so that the United States cannot take care of both Asia and Europe. If the three countries had been able to take rapid steps to jointly launch an offensive at the beginning of the alliance, then the United States, lacking sufficient preparation beforehand and facing the critical juncture of the election, would have felt it difficult to cope. Perhaps the aggression front would have had a chance to succeed. However, due to the inherent weaknesses of the allied countries and their intention to exploit each other, they are watching and procrastinating, and none of them is willing to risk major sacrifices to complete the task of pulling chestnuts out of the fire for their allies first. This situation was particularly evident in the Japanese authorities' repeated expressions last winter. However, the strong reaction aroused by this issue in the United States did not hesitate or waver due to Matsuoka's rhetoric or Nomura's friendship, but continued to actively implement its spirit of prompt action. When the allied countries saw that all other attempts had been ineffective and tried again to appeal to the terms of the alliance to restrain the United States, the situation had changed. Roosevelt's speech was telling them that this attempt to restrain them had lost its final effectiveness. Even if the war truly expanded to the Pacific due to the instigation of the allied countries, the United States would not hesitate to raise its sword, and the aid to Britain plan would not be hindered in any way. The only slight fortunate result would be, at most, the South Pacific encountering war and Japan bringing suffering upon itself.

This situation seems not to be completely ignored by the Japanese authorities. Therefore, sometimes they express that they do not hesitate to fight, and sometimes they are unwilling to risk war. This flickering and confusing attitude, which makes it impossible to determine the truth, is indeed a kind of external posture, but it cannot completely conceal their inner worries and contradictions. In terms of the traditional policies of the Japanese side and their current situation, they naturally only seek to gain without effort and are unlikely to rescue people from danger. The right-wing military men and politicians who loudly advocate colluding with Germany and Italy to oppose Britain and the United States are all based on superficial utilitarian views and take Germany and Italy's victory as their main premise. If they must fight a hard battle and take great risks, with the future being full of unknowns, then it can be asserted that their calls for advancing south would not be so loud and reach the clouds. Nomura's mission to the United States certainly has the intention of delaying the US's steps. On the other hand, it is not without the intention of using Nomura's personal friendships among American people and his naval officer status to determine the true intentions and military strength of the US. This is exactly why the other army officer, Kawatake, was simultaneously sent to the Soviet Union, which was also not accidental. It is said that Roosevelt, immediately after this speech, will further explain the US position in a clear and firm manner to an old friend who has just arrived in the United States. It is expected that unless the other party has completely lost their senses, they will not completely regard these warnings as trivial matters.

### Bai Chongxi Reports on the Victory in Southern Henan, Japanese Plan to Open the Pinghan Railway Fails Completely, Insufficient Supplies a Major Reason for Failure

Chongqing, During the Central Joint Memorial Week on the 10th, Committee Member Bai Chongxi reported on recent military affairs. The full text is as follows: Chairman, esteemed sirs, comrades, in the past two weeks, Japanese troops have been蠢moving in the ×th and ×th war zones, launching offensives separately. The ×th war zone saw greater troop usage, while the ×th war zone saw only small-scale battles. The Headquarters wants to summarize the operational process and report it. (A) In the ×th war zone: (1) The situation of Japanese and Chinese troops before the war and the Japanese military's war preparations. I. The pre-war situation of the Japanese and Chinese troops. The Japanese troops facing the war zone are the 18th Independent Brigade, the 30th Division, the 4th Division, the 3rd Division, the 40th Division, the 236th Regiment, the 14th Independent Brigade, the 64th Battalion, the 116th Division, the 109th Regiment, the 13th Independent Brigade, the 17th Division, the 53rd Regiment, and the 67th Regiment of the 15th Division, totaling approximately three and a half divisions, with approximately 80,000 infantry, approximately 8,000 cavalry, over 550 cannons, over 300 tanks, and over 200 armored vehicles. From mid-January, they first launched a feigned attack from Yuan'an near the west bank of the Xiang River in western Hubei, intending to draw Chinese troops to fight on the west bank of the Xiang River. The front line extended from ××× via ××××× to ××××, a total front of ××× kilometers. In addition to the guard units, the Chinese troops responsible for the first line of defense had only ×× divisions. To consolidate the occupied territories and fearing Chinese attacks, the Japanese took preemptive action to break the Chinese offensive and launched a major offensive against China in southern Henan on January 24th, taking advantage of Chinese troop movements. (II) Japanese war preparations. The Japanese 17th and 15th Divisions, which participated in the Xiangxi Campaign, secretly concentrated in the southern Henan and northern Hubei area in December of last year. Another part of the 40th Division was transferred from southern Hubei to the vicinity of Xinyang. They also stockpiled food and ammunition in the area and built railways and roads. By mid-January, intelligence obtained by the Chinese side indicated that the Japanese had concentrated approximately 30,000 troops, forty or fifty aircraft, and dozens of tanks near Xinyang, and transported many railway materials. In mid-January, they began guerrilla sweeps north along both sides of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. On the 23rd, they attacked Chinese positions on the west bank of the Xiang River, attempting to contain the Chinese troops in that area. The units concentrated in southern Henan included the entire 3rd Division, attached with the 8th Regiment of the 4th Division, and the Mizuno Tank Unit, under the command of Division Commander Toyoshima of the 3rd Division, forming the left-wing corps. The 17th Division and the 53rd Regiment, attached with the 67th Regiment of the 15th Division and the Yoshimatsu Seto and other tank units, under the command of Division Commander Hirabayashi of the 17th Division, formed the central corps. The 234th, 235th, and 236th Regiments of the 40th Division, as well as the division's cavalry regiment, under the command of Division Commander Amagai of the 40th Division, formed the right-wing corps. Starting on January 21st, they advanced towards Chinese positions in separate routes. The Japanese commander was Kazuo Sonobe, commander of the 11th Army. (II) A summary of the operational process. 1. On the Japanese side. After the Japanese troops advancing in the above three routes broke through the Chinese ×× army's positions on January 25th, their left-wing corps advanced west of the Pinghan Railway, repeatedly attempting to surround the Chinese ×× army between Maoji and Gaoyi. After several days of fierce fighting, on the 27th, they detected the concentration of Chinese troops in the southwestern area of Wuyang and turned north, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese ×× division on the Xiaoshidian Weidian line. On the 30th, they advanced to attack Bao'anzhai and Wuyang. The central corps advanced along the front of the Pinghan Railway. After breaking through the positions near Minggang on the 25th, they engaged in fierce fighting with a part of the ××th Division in Queshan on the 26th. On the 27th, a part attacked Zhugou to the west, with the main force advancing north to Zhumadian. On the 28th, another part attacked Runan to the east, with the main force advancing north to Suiping. On the 29th, a part attacked Shangcai and Xiping, with the main force splitting into two routes and attacking Fangcheng to the west. Three days later, they occupied Wuyang. On the evening of February 2nd, they began to retreat south. The right-wing corps retreated in part to Zhengyang, with the main force retreating to Runan on the 28th, merging with the Japanese army that attacked east from Zhumadian. On the 29th, they attacked Shangcai, merging with the Japanese army that attacked east from Suiping. A part attacked Xiangcheng to the east, while another unit, a motorized force of two to three thousand, attacked Xihua to the north on the 31st, then retreated to Runan to merge with the main force. As for the main force of the corps, on the evening of February 2nd, they also attacked south from Shangcai. The Japanese army that attacked Bao'anzhai in Wuyang to the north attacked Fangcheng to the west on February 1st. With a part attacking Tanghe to the south, the main force, approximately five thousand (belonging to the 3rd Division), split into four routes and advanced to attack Nanyang. After fierce fighting with the Chinese ××××× army in Zhaohe Town, they arrived at Nanyang on the evening of the 4th. After being defeated by a certain Chinese unit at dawn on the 6th, on the same day, a portion of the Japanese army, its main force, retreated towards Xinyang after being heavily attacked by Chinese troops. Currently, there are no Japanese troops in the area west of Tongbai, south of Tanghe, and north of Biyang, Zhumadian, and Zhengyang. Five to six hundred Japanese troops in Tongbai have been surrounded and annihilated by a certain Chinese unit. On the Chinese side. Chinese military operational guidance. Recently, Commander-in-Chief × came to Chongqing on official business. Chairman Chiang personally instructed him, giving him face-to-face instructions. At the same time, the Ministry of Military Affairs followed the instructions and issued operational guidance guidelines. This is based on our strategy of attrition warfare and protracted warfare. The use of military force must be suitable for the requirements of the strategy. Based on this strategy, the supreme guiding principle is to determine the operational plan. The key decision at that time was "secrecy." Therefore, after the Japanese advanced north to the line of Shangshui, Luohe, and Nanyang, they only struck empty air, unable to find the main force of the Chinese army. Their flanks, such as Xinyang, Queshan, Zhengyang, and Biyang, were instead subjected to serious attacks by Chinese troops. Furthermore, the rear lines of communication were repeatedly intercepted, and the supply of food and ammunition was cut off. Therefore, the Japanese made a large swing to the left, retreating towards Fangcheng, Nanyang, and Dianhe. The original intention of the Japanese was to eliminate the Chinese field army, open up the Pinghan Railway, and cut off Chinese transportation, so that our army west of the Pinghan Railway would lose contact. The result was striking at empty air everywhere, gaining nothing. Not finding the main force of the Chinese army, they suffered heavy attacks from the Chinese. At this point, the Japanese plan was completely shattered by China. This campaign yielded great results. The number of Japanese casualties was very large. When retreating from Nanyang, they automatically burned over three hundred cars. We seized approximately three hundred long and short rifles and countless other military supplies. A certain army has been continuously attacking the flanks of the Japanese army in Biyang, and has also obtained many spoils of war. In addition, many Japanese soldiers were captured. Commander-in-Chief Wei Guan Chen reported that, according to the report of a certain commander-in-chief, an educated soldier among the prisoners confessed that the Japanese army advanced rapidly in this invasion with a week of forced marching without rest. At the same time, there was insufficient supplies, and some even had not eaten for three days. They also had no woolen or cotton uniforms, all wearing only單uniforms, which could not withstand the cold. Therefore, their combat effectiveness was weakened. The prisoner also stated that the Japanese troops participating in this battle were transported from Hankou by柴轮to Guangzhou. This shows that the Japanese are indeed eager to advance south. I have previously reported this matter. The most gratifying thing about this campaign is the brave fighting of the soldiers and the appropriate guidance of the officers. The commanders at all levels of the ×th war zone, from the commander-in-chief down, were able to thoroughly carry out orders. This proves that the thinking of Chinese military tactics has become completely consistent. The theories of attrition warfare and mobile warfare that have been advocated in recent years are very correct. (B) In the ×th war zone. The Japanese landed east of Dapeng Bay, Duntou Bay, and Aotou, advancing towards Danshui and Pinghu, attempting to cut off our transportation between Hong Kong and Huizhou. These are currently only small-scale battles. According to a telegram from Commander-in-Chief ××, and a report from Commander Yuan of ××, who is advancing towards Doumen, on the fifth of this month, a large plane was destroyed with machine gun fire in Dachikan, District 8, Zhongshan County. Naval Admiral Baron Osamu Osami and several naval officers also died. Various forces have proven that Osamu intended to go to Hainan Island from Guangzhou to preside over the southward advance plan. Here, we can also see his active pursuit of a risky southward advance, which coincides with the confession of the prisoners interrogated in the ×th war zone. After receiving the report, the central government ordered Commander Wei Guan of × to transport the body of Admiral Osamu to Kunlun Pass to be buried with the Japanese officers and soldiers who died in the previous Battle of Kunlun Pass, in order to show preferential treatment to the fallen Japanese soldiers. The above is a summary of the war in the ×× two war zones. Currently, we are indeed confident in military affairs, and the foundation for final victory has been laid. The most important issue in the future is not military affairs, but to promote our political and economic construction with all our spirits, hoping to complete the great cause of nation-building at the same time as winning the war.

### Longhua Manufacturing Plant Partially Opens

Chongqing, The Longhua Paper Mill has already started operating in the rear. As reported previously, a reporter recently visited and found its scale to be unprecedented. The factory site is located on a mountain by the river with beautiful scenery. According to the factory's manager, Pang Zanchen, due to electricity issues, only a part of the factory is currently operating, producing 5,000 pounds of paper per day. After full operation, it is expected to produce 20,000 pounds of paper per day. Because culture is closely related to paper, despite extreme difficulties, it is starting operation as soon as possible to manufacture newspapers and supply the needs of various cultural institutions and organizations, with prices lower than cost, to show the significance of promoting culture.

### European War to Spread to the Balkans, German Giant Planes Continuously Transporting Troops, Intending to Use Bulgaria as a Base to Invade Greece

London, Today, all Europeans are worried that Germany will take surprising action against Britain and Greece early. The London "Daily Mail" stated this morning that most people expect Germany to issue an ultimatum to Bulgaria at any time, demanding the right to send troops to the Greek border. (12th International News Agency Dispatch)

London, News from the capital of Yugoslavia said that -1,000 German aircraft have landed in Bulgaria. This morning, the newspapers here said that this is further proof that the European war has spread to the Balkans. The news especially warned British Prime Minister Churchill, saying that the German Air Force will use Bulgaria as an operational base. According to news from the Hungarian capital, about one hundred aircraft have flown over the Hungarian capital in the past forty-eight hours. News from other sources said that each of these aircraft can carry one hundred people, bringing the number of German troops in Bulgaria to 100,000. (16th United Press Dispatch)

Yugoslav Capital, According to news received here today, "A small team of German Air Force instructors has arrived in Bulgaria and is now stationed at various air stations." This matter has been confirmed today by a Bulgarian semi-official newspaper, but it denies diplomatic reports that a large number of German troops are now entering Bulgaria. (12th International News Agency Dispatch)

Later, the British also believed that Germany would exert pressure on Turkey. (12th International News Agency Dispatch)

### Four Major Powers of Italy, Germany, France Meeting; Italian Newspaper Hints at No Room for Compromise with England; Says Axis Military Procedures Will Soon Be Completed

Bern, Switzerland - It is reported that Hitler, Pétain, Mussolini, and Franco will meet at 11:00 AM today on the French Riviera coast to discuss the collapse of Italian forces in Africa. General Franco's special car entered French territory from the Barcelona area at 8:00 AM this morning. (United Press dispatch, 12th)

Vichy - French Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Darlan, and Interior Minister Béraud, left Vichy by car this morning to attend the Franco-German talks to be held tomorrow afternoon on the French Riviera. The two will likely meet with Marshal Pétain, Franco, and Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer at Pétain's villa. At the same time, French officials stated that they had not heard of any Anglo-Italian peace negotiations being held on the French Riviera. It is said that this rumor may have arisen from a misunderstanding regarding Franco's visit to Italy. Officials stated that General Franco was not in the Riviera today; he crossed the border into Italy last night and will return to France on Thursday. It is said that Pétain and Franco will largely not be involved in Anglo-Italian peace talks, as Pétain has no qualifications to speak on behalf of either England or Italy. Well-informed sources expressed doubt as to whether England and Italy would send representatives to France without notifying their governments. However, observers said that Darlan's departure today to join Pétain for talks was quite important. Previously, it was believed that the meeting between Pétain and Franco was merely a ceremonial contact between the heads of two states, but a Spanish source indicated that the talks would have deeper and broader significance. It is reported that Marshal Pétain arrived at the villa in Villeneuve-Loubet on the Riviera at 8:45 AM this morning. (United Press dispatch, 12th)

Rome - As rumors circulate that Spanish dictator General Franco has arrived in San Remo to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, yesterday Italian newspapers hinted that the Axis powers would take significant actions involving Spain. A reporter for the "Italian Daily" reported from the current location that "the Axis powers' precise and unchanging military procedures will soon be completed." The newspaper also warned that if the United States arrived in time to rescue Britain from destruction, "America will see that all of Europe will fight against its armed forces." Rumors that General Franco came to Italy to mediate the Italian-Greek war have been denied by officials here. Officials said that the Italian-Greek war cannot be mediated. They hinted that General Franco's visit was related to a major Axis action involving Spain, but the nature of this action was not disclosed. Whether Franco's visit is related to Spain joining the Axis powers or an attack on Gibraltar has aroused much speculation. It is said that General Franco appears to sympathize with the Axis powers on the one hand, but is also forced to comply with American foreign policy on the other. Mr. Franco's situation is truly a mystery. (International News Service dispatch, 12th)

England Denies Intention to Make Peace with Italy; Downplays Italian-Spanish Talks

London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that a responsible spokesperson in London solemnly denied rumors that Britain is preparing to negotiate a separate peace with Italy, saying that the war against Italy will continue with increased force. Informed sources also believe that Mussolini has no intention of seeking peace. The true intention of this meeting with Franco is to seek new assistance to resist Britain. However, the general opinion in London is that Franco has already announced a policy of "peace, tranquility, and food," and may not be willing to get involved in the war. People here do not attach much importance to the meeting between the leaders of Italy and Spain, considering it merely a ceremonial visit by Franco to his old friend. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

Spain Evolves from Neutral Status to Non-Belligerent Status

Vichy - Reliable sources here recently confirmed that Spanish head of state Franco, accompanied by Foreign Minister Suñer, has traveled through France to Italy to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini. German leader Hitler may also travel to Italy to meet with them. On his return journey, General Franco will also meet with Marshal Pétain in southern France. There are many rumors about the purpose of Franco's trip. One says that Spain, on the one hand, has close relations with Italy, and on the other hand, maintains friendly relations with Britain, so it is an ideal mediator for the current war between Britain and Italy. But other sources say that the dictators of Italy and Spain have the possibility of meeting with German leader Hitler at the same time, which shows that this is a sign of the Axis powers consulting with each other before launching a large-scale offensive against England. The French government has remained silent on this matter, neither denying nor confirming what has been published in the newspapers in semi-official statements, only reiterating Spain's position since the outbreak of the European war. It is generally said that General Franco first issued a statement on September 4, 1939, declaring that "Spain's interests in the Mediterranean and Africa will be strictly neutral with respect to the European war as long as they are not directly hindered." This position has been repeatedly stated in editorials published by the country's newspapers. It was not until after Italy declared war on England last June that Spain evolved from a neutral country to a "non-belligerent country." Subsequently, semi-official statements repeatedly stated that "non-belligerent country" did not mean that the country sided with one of the belligerents, but only meant that the country was in a "state of alert." Until October last year, the authorities of Germany, Italy, and Spain again held direct talks. Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer visited Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Berlin, and then traveled to Rome to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano. Before Marshal Pétain and Hitler met in Montoire, France, on October 23 last year, Franco personally crossed the border between France and Spain and met with Hitler in Hendaye. This is a general overview of the changes in Spain's position over the past year and a half. However, in recent weeks, the situation in the Mediterranean has entered another stage. Franco must meet with the leaders of Germany and Italy again, and take the opportunity to meet with Marshal Pétain, because since the end of the Spanish Civil War, General Pétain has served as the first French ambassador to Spain, and the leaders of France and Spain know each other very well.

### South African Troops Fight Bravely; Penetrate 50 Miles into Abyssinian Territory; Indian Infantry Shows Great Skill on Eritrean Front

Cairo - The British army's battle to capture Keren in Eritrea is still underway. According to the latest news received in Cairo last night, British South African troops have penetrated 50 miles into Abyssinia, posing a new threat to Addis Ababa (the Abyssinian capital). South African troops have penetrated enemy-occupied territory southeast of Lake Rudolf and are advancing along the ring road connecting the Abyssinian capital with the Red Sea to the northeast, threatening two important routes traversing Abyssinia from east to west, linking southern Abyssinia with Italian Somaliland. It is reported that this military operation is progressing smoothly. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

London - London has just received a detailed battle report stating that British South African troops made great contributions in the British army's capture of Hobok, a southern Abyssinian town. South African troops met with a British unit from Turkana, camped on the border, and then advanced through 18 miles of dense jungle towards their target. A brigade commander described the march, saying that the rapid advance of the British motorized troops through this extremely difficult jungle was an unprecedented achievement for motorized troops. In the western desert, Indian infantry, engineers, and mechanized cavalry also achieved great successes in operations in Eritrea. The terrain in this area is similar to the northwestern border of India, so Indian troops found it easy to operate. In bayonet fighting, they repeatedly captured heights held by Italian troops and immediately attacked down the slopes. In the Battle of Barentu, Indian troops fought for many days before capturing the area. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Free French Forces; Achieve Repeated Successes

A motorized French column led by Colonel Leclerc has occupied several meadows in the Koufra area. On February 7, French aircraft bombed an Italian air force base, destroying important targets and many enemy aircraft on the ground. The French air force's fierce attack on the base caused significant losses to the enemy's manpower and material resources. The battle is still progressing satisfactorily. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Shoes Made of Pigskin; Socks Woven from Wood Fiber; Japan Feels a Great Shortage of Raw Materials; Substitute Industries Flourish

Tokyo - According to the "Asahi Shimbun", the Japanese people have never paid much attention to substitutes. Now, the substitute manufacturing industry is progressing very rapidly. For example, Bakelite safety razors and items made of synthetic rubber are now very useful, and long and short socks woven from wood fiber, if washed properly, are quite durable. Shoes made of pigskin and shark skin are not only strong, but also very beautiful in color. Therefore, the general public is increasingly happy to use them. In addition, hard rubber is widely used and can replace metals such as lead, tin, and antimony in the manufacture of various daily necessities. Waterworks in Tokyo and Osaka will use this material to manufacture water taps. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

He praised Chairman Chiang's leadership in China's resistance and reconstruction efforts. He said that Chairman Chiang, who is admired by the people of the whole country, is a sincere, talented, and virtuous leader, worthy of the people's support. The most profound impression the reporter had during this trip to China was the unity and solidarity of the whole country in resisting and building the country. The development of Chinese industry is also worthy of praise. As for China's foreign trade, the reporter dared to say that there is great potential for trade between China and Burma. The Yunnan-Burma Highway has been completed, and the Yunnan-Burma Railway has also begun construction. This highway and this railway will increasingly promote trade between China and Burma. China needs many goods from Burma, just as Burma needs goods from China. How to seize the current opportunity to develop trade with China depends on the efforts of the Burmese people. U Ba Khin then discussed China's achievements in eliminating illiteracy. It is said that the efforts of Chinese scholars and teachers have made a deep impression on individuals. The spirit of the Chinese people in enduring and overcoming all obstacles and difficulties is admirable. Before the war, there were only 33 colleges in inland China, but now there are 101. This is enough to prove the progress of the Chinese people in the war. The reporter saw Chinese students studying in temporary venues without being deterred by repeated Japanese bombings, which was admirable. The simplicity of life is also touching. (Dispatch, 12th)

### European War Talks (XXXIII) Secret Stories of American Diplomacy

At this time, important developments also occurred in the Far East. In the spring of 1939, when Japan blockaded the British Concession in Tianjin, both Britain and France had intentions of compromising with Japan. President Roosevelt and Hull had already considered abolishing the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty to counteract Japanese trade, threatening the Japanese military with the cutoff of military supplies. Hull immediately consulted secretly with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and decided to have Senator Vandenberg propose a motion to abolish the treaty. This move came from a leading figure of the isolationist faction, which was exactly what President Roosevelt and Hull were seeking. The treaty was declared abolished at the end of July.

In August 1939, Hitler concentrated a large army to prepare for an attack on Poland. Britain and France had provided guarantees to Poland, Romania, and Turkey, willing to provide assistance. Negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union were on the verge of collapse. On the American side, due to the arms embargo not yet being lifted, their words lacked weight. However, after discussions between the President and Welles, it was decided to make one last appeal for peace, planning to send a telegram to King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, asking him to mediate peace.

Around August 1st to 5th, German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg hinted to Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov that Hitler was preparing to negotiate a German-Soviet treaty. When this news reached the State Department, the President had already left Washington for a vacation in Hyde Park, New York.

Other countries were greatly astonished by this news. However, since 1934, the United States had already received warnings, issued by U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt. Although Britain and France had also received similar warnings, they never believed it would actually happen. In fact, after the purge in the Soviet Union, Stalin had already suggested to Hitler that they jointly attack Western European countries. At that time, Hitler refused because he feared Britain and had not yet abandoned his plan to advance eastward. However, negotiations between the two countries on this matter never ceased, with frequent contact through special diplomatic channels and between business delegations and military authorities of both sides.

As early as the beginning of 1939, Hitler, influenced by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's urging and the weakness of British policy, greatly changed his attitude towards Britain. Secret German-Soviet negotiations then entered a new stage. In May, the Soviet Union replaced Litvinov with Molotov as Foreign Affairs Commissar. When Britain and Poland formed a temporary agreement, Hitler instructed Ambassador Schulenburg to inform Molotov that the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by Germany, Japan, and Italy had no real meaning, that Britain was the common enemy of the Soviet Union and Germany, and that the two countries should increase relations in trade and other areas. Hitler's original intention was only to keep the Soviet Union out of the united front of Britain, France, and Poland. Unexpectedly, Molotov's reply advocated not only increasing trade relations but also enhancing political relations. Schulenburg was surprised to hear this.

Germany and the Soviet Union then began negotiations on a commercial agreement, but Hitler still hoped that Poland would yield on the Danzig issue, so as to use the "Polish Corridor" to attack Soviet Ukraine. Molotov's suggestion did not receive a concrete response for a while. While urging Schulenburg to reply, Stalin ordered Defense Commissar Voroshilov to discuss an anti-German front with Britain and France. Later, the Danzig issue reached a stalemate, and Hitler, knowing that Poland could not be subdued, abruptly changed the course of negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Britain and France, like the U.S. State Department, received the same intelligence. However, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds and French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Payart did not believe a German-Soviet alliance was possible. They deeply believed in Voroshilov's resounding and sincere proposals (Voroshilov was also completely unaware of the tricks that Stalin and Molotov were secretly playing). At that time, only China, after receiving the news, acted accordingly. Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the Chinese Executive Yuan, sent a personal representative who flew to Paris on August 8th to meet with U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt. After obtaining confidential information, he immediately telegraphed Chongqing. After receiving this telegram, Chiang Kai-shek, after consulting with several ministers of the Executive Yuan, politely refused a certain grain treaty that the Soviet Union had requested to be concluded. On August 16th, Voroshilov hinted to the British and French representatives that as long as Poland allowed a portion of Soviet troops to enter its territory, the Soviet Union could join their front to resist Germany. He did not know that on that very day, Schulenburg and Molotov had already finalized the text of the German-Soviet treaty.

At dawn on September 1, 1939, the President was awakened by a wireless telephone from Paris reporting the German invasion of Poland. He turned on the light, propped himself up on the pillow, lit a cigarette, and then made separate phone calls to Hull, Welles, Secretary of War Woodring, and Secretary of the Navy Edison, notifying them of the warning. Woodring and Edison also notified Army Chief of Staff Marshall and Chief of Naval Operations Stark, immediately ordering the fleets in the Pacific and Atlantic and the army units from Samoa in the South Pacific to Fort Devens in Massachusetts via wireless telegraph.

Hull and Welles quickly got up and rushed to the State Department. Shortly after, Under Secretary of State Welles, Chief of the European Division Moffat, and others also arrived one after another. In reality, they had nothing to do at this time except wait for telegrams. Most of the time, they sat around Hull's desk, discussing the war aimlessly, like people at a funeral mourning the deceased. Only Welles sighed with emotion, "We have waited for Europe to die, and it can be said that we have finally seen it happen."

The President, however, was very at ease. After completing the notifications, he fell back asleep until 6:30 AM, when a second wireless telephone call from U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt woke him up again. In a short period of time, Bullitt had met with French Premier Daladier, who said fatalistically that he had already declared that Britain and France must aid Poland, otherwise they would not be able to establish themselves and would lose the last chance to resist the spread of National Socialist forces. Bullitt also reported to the President that Britain and France would definitely join the war. Such news would naturally throw others into confusion, but the President remained calm and unhurried, sleeping for another forty-five minutes until a telephone call from British Ambassador Kennedy in London woke him up for the third time. Kennedy reported on his meeting with British Prime Minister Chamberlain, the nature of which was no different from what Bullitt and Daladier had discussed, but Kennedy's tone was extremely pessimistic. At this point, the President no longer intended to sleep. He called his servants to prepare breakfast and spent an hour planning the overall situation in bed.

Before the President's plans were finalized, Welles barged into the bedroom and held a bedside meeting with the President. It was immediately decided that as soon as Britain and France declared war on Germany, a special Pan-American conference would be convened. The President advocated drawing a safety zone in the territorial waters and contiguous waters of the American countries, and implementing a "neutrality patrol" by the U.S. fleet, so that the entire Western Hemisphere would not be affected by naval warfare. After Welles left, the President ordered Edison to draft a plan.

At this time, the President got out of bed, put on his robe, and walked into the office to meet with reporters. Shortly after, Hull also arrived. They then made separate wireless telephone calls to the ambassadors in Britain and France, the minister to Poland, and the chargé d'affaires in Germany. They felt that since the war had already broken out and people were terrified, amending the Neutrality Act to abolish the provisions prohibiting the shipment of military supplies to belligerent countries in order to aid democratic countries would surely gain the support of the majority of people, but a special session of Congress could only be convened after public opinion had matured.

At around 4:00 AM on Sunday, September 3rd, the telephone by the President's bedside rang again. Ambassador Kennedy reported the gist of Chamberlain's declaration of war speech to the President, which was given to Kennedy two hours before its release. Ambassador Kennedy was extremely emotional and at this time was extremely sad, constantly saying, "The world is over, everything is over."

However, the President did not react with the same emotionalism as Kennedy, and tried his best to comfort him over the phone. Then, the President again called each of the cabinet members to notify them of the new developments in the war. The President slept for a while, got up early, and prepared his broadcast address. Welles had already sent out notices in the morning to convene a special Pan-American conference. At around 11:00 AM, he went to the White House to present the agenda of the Pan-American conference and the scope of the safety zone for the President's review. The plan designated a safety zone of one hundred leagues around the sea surrounding the Western Hemisphere, but the President did not agree. He personally used a ruler to redraw the boundaries, expanding the safety zone to an average of three hundred miles and straightening the boundaries.

At 2:30 PM, the President read his broadcast address in the Lincoln Study of the White House, with Hull, Welles, Welles, and others sitting around the President. The main points of the President's speech were that the United States should remain neutral, that the Neutrality Act would remain in effect until amended, that foreign propaganda should be prevented, and that the countries of North and South America must be urged to unite. He also solemnly said, "I hope that the United States will not be drawn into the vortex of this war, and I believe we can definitely do it."

The chaotic situation of early September came to an end. After this, the President and Hull and others continued to work hard to amend the Neutrality Act, first abolishing the arms embargo, and then finding ways to help democratic countries resist aggression. (The End)

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Office Searched Yesterday Morning Important Documents of the Association Had Been Transported to Hong Kong Only National Loan Domestic Sales Certificates Are Now Being Issued The Police Department Has Sent a Large Number of Detectives to Protect It

The address of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was originally located at the north end of Tianhougong Bridge on North Henan Road. After the National Army withdrew westward, it was forcibly occupied by a certain party. The association, in addition to moving most of its important documents to Hong Kong with Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Standing Committee Member Du Yuesheng, Jin Runyang, and others to establish an office, set up an office in Shanghai at Room 305, 3rd Floor, No. 59 Hong Kong Road. This has been nearly three years. Yesterday morning, at Huashi, it was suddenly invaded and some documents were seized. Later, after the detectives and the American Team of the Chamber of Commerce arrived, the invaders left one after another. The Chamber of Commerce is now preparing for the aftermath and continuing to work. The details are as follows:

A Large Number of People Invaded and Searched

At 9:30 yesterday morning, more than 50 people, in two trucks, accompanied by several foreigners, went to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce office at No. 59 Hong Kong Road, intending to seize all the documents. At that time, more than a dozen staff members of the association were busy working, and after being forced to search, they were driven out one by one, and some of the documents were wrapped up and taken away.

Detectives and Chamber of Commerce Team Rushed to Protect

The association reported the above situation to the Public Concession Police Department, which dispatched a large number of detectives from the smoking room and dispatched the American Team of the Chamber of Commerce to protect and stop the seizure of items. When these people saw this situation, they left one after another. Yesterday afternoon, the office was guarded by detectives, and the American Chamber of Commerce team was stationed in front of No. 59 Hong Kong Road and the east and west ends of Hong Kong Road to provide protection.

Continuing to Issue National Product Certificates

It is reported that the documents seized from the association's office were not important. The most important task of the association is to issue national product certificates, because goods from Shanghai merchants transported to the mainland cannot be sold without the association's certificates. Since the Shanghai business community has this need, the association is preparing for the aftermath so that it can continue to work as usual.

Newspaper Report on What Happened

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that today (the 12th), the Japanese attempted to take over the documents of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. It is reported that at 10:00 in the morning, 12 Japanese men in plain clothes, accompanied by several Chinese, went to the Chamber of Commerce office in the Bank Club at No. 59 Hong Kong Road and "requested" the surrender of the records and documents of the Chamber of Commerce. However, people in the Chamber of Commerce reported to the General Patrol Room. Before long, many senior police officers arrived and negotiated for a long time before resolving the matter and preventing the Japanese from moving a single item. It is reported that these Japanese did not carry any formal proof papers. At that time, the Japanese also drove several trucks to the side of Hong Kong Road, apparently intending to transport all the documents of the Chamber of Commerce. However, after the Public Concession police arrived at the scene, the Japanese did not obtain any documents from the Chamber of Commerce and left.

### Authorities Strengthen Cooperation to Supervise Prices and Inspect Weights and Measures at Any Time

The authorities of the two concessions continue to implement price supervision policies within the concessions. The Price Control Committee of the French Concession Public Works Department and the Price Investigation Office of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau cooperated closely last year to crack down on high prices and improper habits of merchants, which was quite effective. Last year, the Price Investigation Office of the Public Concession filed 187 lawsuits against unscrupulous merchants in some months of the second half of the year. Most of them were fined for charging prices exceeding the label or for selling items with insufficient weight, which made these people know how to restrain themselves. The authorities of the two concessions, in view of the fact that prices are still high since the new year, have decided to continue to maintain close contact and strengthen cooperation in some aspects in order to stabilize people's livelihoods. In addition to effectively monitoring the wholesale and retail prices of major items, the weights and measures used by merchants will be inspected at any time, and the evil practice of monopoly and hoarding will be strictly cracked down on. In order to fundamentally suppress the prices in Shanghai, the restrictions on the shipment of some major items to Shanghai will be resolved step by step with the assistance of relevant parties.

### Navigation Between Waibaidu Bridge and Mughan Road Can Be Done

According to the Japanese-language "Continental News," the section of the Suzhou River from Waibaidu Bridge to Mughan Road, which has been closed for nearly three years, was opened to navigation on Tuesday by the "Central China Railway Company."

### Famous American Reporter Talks About Coming to Shanghai The United States Cannot Avoid a War The People Have Abandoned Fatalistic Ideas Unite and Work Hard to Rebuild Armaments

Du Ting, a well-known Far East reporter and current Shanghai correspondent for the "New York Times," returned to Shanghai on the SS President Coolidge yesterday, the 11th, after vacationing in the United States. According to him, the United States itself does not know whether it will join the European war. The world is now asking about the psychology of the American people. In fact, the American people have abandoned their fatalistic ideas and mostly believe that the United States' participation in the war is inevitable. Du Ting has been in the Far East for ten years. It was not until October of last year that he and his wife left Shanghai for the first time for a vacation. When staying at his residence in Pecos City, Texas, he witnessed the presidential election. According to Du Ting, Roosevelt's election as the third president is the clear will of the people. Du Ting also criticized the national defense program that the United States has been carrying out for six months, saying that the entire United States has only now begun to devote itself to the national defense program. Isolationists and advocates of compromise are still active under the leadership of Senator Wheeler. However, on the whole, the United States has united and is determined to work hard to rebuild its armaments. According to reports, Du Ting was stationed in Chongqing as the representative of the "New York Times" before his vacation last year. This time, he came to China as the Shanghai correspondent for the newspaper.

### This Year's Engineering Bureau Election Decided to Be Handled According to the Chen Method The Qualifications of Electors are Strictly Regulated The Japanese Proposal is Not Allowed by Legal Facts

The Engineering Bureau issued a bulletin yesterday, announcing the regulations regarding the qualifications of electors and the method of compiling the electoral roll. It is reported that these provisions have been approved by the Engineering Bureau and will be implemented in the election of the directors and land committee members of the Engineering Bureau for the 1941-42 fiscal year in April. Several of the provisions issued by the Engineering Bureau adopted the recommendations of the Special Election Committee. However, the issue of the "scattered voting method" was not mentioned. It is reported that the Engineering Bureau will use last year's method for the election this year and will not change the "scattered voting method." At the meeting of the Special Election Committee, the members failed to reach a resolution on the issue of the "scattered voting method." Representatives of Japan, Germany, and Italy requested that "extraordinary" measures be taken for the "scattered voting method" and demanded that it be abolished. However, the three members from Britain, the United States, and France believed that the Engineering Bureau did not have the legal right to require landowners to prove that they were genuine owners.

Election Qualifications Strictly Limited

The provisions on the qualifications of electors issued by the Engineering Bureau stipulate that any individual or business firm who wishes to apply to be added to the final electoral roll must submit the application at least one month before the date of election of the directors. After this deadline, all applications will not be accepted. The Secretary-General of the Engineering Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of the Land Charter, will publish a preliminary list of individuals or business firms eligible to participate in the election on or around December 20. The final electoral roll, which has been revised, will be published as soon as possible one month before the election date. Landowners who have been registered, if they fail to pay the land rent for the year prior to the Engineering Bureau election and the annual meeting of taxpayers one month before the election, their names will not be added to the final electoral roll. The names of registered landowners whose land ownership was acquired between January 1 and the date the Engineering Bureau publishes the final electoral roll will not be added to the final electoral roll. However, this registered landowner will be listed as an exception if he pays the land rent for the first half of the year one month before the date of the directors' election. The regulations on the qualifications of electors and the method of compiling the electoral roll issued by the H-Bureau are mostly the same as those issued last year.

Japanese Proposals Cannot Be Adopted

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Engineering Bureau officials today refused to comment on the interim report released yesterday by the Bureau's Special Election Committee, saying only, "The public must be able to draw their own conclusions." The opinions of the Special Election Committee on the election issue are now divided into two equally powerful units, namely, the German member Grede, the Italian member Fumagalli, and the Japanese member Yasui Gengo, who support Yasui Gengo's proposal. Others, such as the American member Kana, the British member Mitchell, and the French member Chavret, unanimously opposed this proposal. According to An's proposal, a special committee of five people should be organized to investigate the qualifications of voters and land transferors in the Public Concession. The reason for this is that no business firm or individual should have more than one vote. However, another member of the committee claimed that this was beyond the powers of the Engineering Bureau. An also made a suggestion to the committee, saying, "According to the established procedure, the transfer of land ownership should not be used as a reason for joining the electoral roll before the transfer is made at the Chinese Land Office. However, at present, the Chinese Land Office has stopped working. Therefore, to prove that they are landowners, they should submit all files and other relevant documents to the Engineering Bureau." At that time, some members raised opinions, saying that the Engineering Bureau did not have the power to require others to prove that they were landowners. Another member said that if the election used the registered method, a large number of current voters would object. If the Engineering Bureau removed their names from the electoral roll, they could sue the Engineering Bureau in the Consular Court and force the Engineering Bureau to re-add their names to the electoral roll.

Mr. Arnhold's Candid Expression

Yesterday, a certain newspaper reported that the American Chinese Association had decided to nominate Arnhold and McMullen as candidates for the Engineering Bureau directors after several meetings, and would no longer resolve the matter by voting among the overseas Chinese. However, some overseas Chinese expressed their opposition. After seeing the report, a reporter from the Great China News Agency visited Mr. Arnhold yesterday afternoon to inquire about his opinion. According to reports, "It seems too early for me to express my attitude at this time." The reporter also asked, "According to what is currently known, the American Chinese Association has already nominated you and McMullen as candidates. With the current situation, it seems that there will be no preliminary election of American directors this year. In the future, will there be any chance for the American Chinese Association to change this issue?" The reply was, "Although the American Chinese Association has already nominated us two as candidates, if there are still some overseas Chinese who advocate adding one or two candidates, then a preliminary election must be held." When Mr. Arnhold made this statement, his attitude was extraordinarily candid, believing that his actions were all based on the will of the public, without any prejudice whatsoever. This is especially admirable.

Five Chinese Directors Decided to Continue

A spokesman for the Chinese Taxpayers Association said yesterday that the current situation is critical, and it is not planned to hold the election of the five Chinese directors this year. It has been decided to respect the unanimous opinions of the taxpayers and ask the five Chinese directors to continue. According to an Engineering Bureau official, the Engineering Bureau has no direct control over the election methods adopted by the Chinese Taxpayers Association. After the Chinese Taxpayers Association decides who will be elected as Chinese directors, it only needs to notify the Engineering Bureau of the decision, and the Engineering Bureau will recognize the directors it has put forward as legal.

### Senior Rice Industry Officials Illegal Transactions Brokers Request the Association to Stop It

The authorities of the two concessions have specially proposed seven measures for the Rice Market Management Committee and instructed the market to earnestly implement them as of today. The association has discussed and revised them one by one in a meeting a few days ago. Yesterday, it was reported to the Bean and Rice Industry Association, requesting a review before implementation. The Bean and Rice Association has scheduled a temporary committee meeting for 3:00 PM tomorrow at No. 15 Edward Road to discuss the matter at length so that a decision can be made. A letter from the Rice Grain Brokerage Association has been sent to the Miscellaneous Grain Association, stating that the association has informed all its members that they must not sneak into the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange under any pretext every afternoon. If they dare to do so deliberately, they will report to the concession authorities for investigation. However, the letter also stated that senior officials in the rice industry are also involved in such illegal transactions, and the association is requested to find a way to stop them.

### Chamber of Commerce Chinese Team Inspected and Rewarded Commander Xiang Pei Gave Farewell Encouragement

Colonel Xiang Pei, the commander of the Shanghai International Chamber of Commerce, will be returning to China in the near future after completing his three-year term. Yesterday evening, he made a farewell inspection of the members of the Chinese Team and the Translation Team of the regiment in the Engineering Bureau drill hall. At 5:30 PM, all the members of the two teams and the newly replenished reserve team arrived on time. Major Chen Shixia, the commander of the Chinese team, served as the general commander and formed three horizontal teams. At 6:30 PM, Colonel Xiang Pei and Deputy Commander Xu Tonghao arrived. First, the entire team raised their guns with both hands in salute, and then the inspection was held. After the inspection, Captain Chen led the officers of the two teams to the officer's room on the fourth floor for a drink. At around 7:00 PM, they returned to the regiment's gym to ask the commander to distribute the awards to the members of the Chinese team from the previous session. Those who received the 12-year Engineering Bureau Long Service Medal included Wang Tingkui, Liu Mingshan, Ye Renqian, Liu Hanzhang, Gao Junzhi, Chen Yueqiu, Shen Guanbao, Ding Guobao, etc. Yu Xian'en received the 25-year Merit Award, Li Yushu and Gu Runsheng received the 20-year Award, Zhang Qixiang, Pan Mingxin, Shen Guanbao, and Jiang Zhongjia received the 15-year Award, and Cao Siqin and Zhang Huaiqing received the 10-year Award. (There were many others who received the 5-year, 3-year, and full award medals and certificates, whose names are omitted.) After the awards were given, Captain Chen used the name of the Chinese team to commemorate something. The commander gave a speech, admonishing everyone. He especially praised the Chinese team members for their neat uniforms, excellent military appearance and discipline, enthusiastic participation in training, and their past enthusiasm for serving public security. After the ceremony, everyone dispersed with cheers.

### Salvation Army Donations Reached More Than 80,000 Packages Yesterday

Brigadier Ma Lishuai, the head of the Salvation Army in the city, said that people from China and abroad have been enthusiastically donating to the Salvation Army's fundraising campaign. Yesterday, more than 84,000 yuan in national currency was received. If you would like to donate, please send it to the Salvation Army Headquarters at No. 40 Sassoon House on Nanjing Road.

### In the Height of Early Spring Chill, Snowflakes Dance at the University

Although it is now spring, the weather is bitterly cold, even more so than last winter. Yesterday, starting from noon, amidst the drizzling rain, snow pellets suddenly fell, and snowflakes fluttered in the air. It was the first snowfall of the year, lasting about two hours before stopping. The snow continued to fall into the evening, accumulating to about an inch. In addition, there was a high tide in the Huangpu River yesterday, causing water to accumulate on the low-lying roads in the two concessions, almost submerging ankles.

### French Police Arrest Kidnappers

The day before yesterday (the 11th), at 8:00 PM, the French police department dispatched detectives, along with Japanese military police, to arrest four people from Jiangbei - Qian Yuebin, Liu Rongcai, Liu Lao Liu, and Tong Sihai - at the Xiaocai market on Haig Road in Xujiahui. Subsequently, they also arrested Ji Genming, a local (owner of the Shizhonglou restaurant on Sze Tze Wai Road). It is said that the above-mentioned criminals are all related to a certain kidnapping case and are currently being detained in the police station pending interrogation.

### Shooting at a Passing Car, Gets Shot Instead

According to news from the agency, the day before yesterday evening, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai, a man opened fire on a passing car but missed. "Police" heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene, shooting and killing the man. It is reported that a black car (number unknown) was traveling east when, near the wire mesh fence of the Paramount Hotel, the man suddenly drew a gun and fired three shots at the car. The driver of the car quickly accelerated and crossed the wire mesh, so he was not hit. The shooter was then shot and injured by the guard "police". One bullet hit a vital spot, and he fell immediately near the Tailai car dealership at the intersection of Yuyuan Road. He died after a while. The deceased was about twenty years old and was wearing a blue long robe.

### Robbery on the Street, One Culprit Killed

Ling Hongxi, a nineteen-year-old youth from Wanlai Youth Association, residing at 344 Ying Shi Road in the French Concession, his father, Ling Yufa, is currently fifty-eight years old and has always been a peddler. Hongxi is unemployed. At around 10:00 PM on the 7th of this month, while passing Lane 131 on Rue Bourgeat, two street robbers dashed out from the lane. He fled forward, with Hongxi running wildly behind him. When he fled to the entrance of No. 189 Route Lafayette, he happened to encounter a patrolman No. 923 who ordered him to stop for inspection. Not only did they not listen, but the three of them continued to rush forward. The patrolman then opened fire to pursue and arrest them. The two robbers in front quickly disappeared, while Ling Hongxi, who was behind, was hit by nine bullets, injured and fell to the ground. When the patrolman approached to check, he found a fake pistol left beside Ling's body, determining that Ling Hongxi was suspected of being a thief. The patrolman took the fake pistol back to the police station, reported to the head, and sent Ling to Guangci Hospital for treatment. He also sent detectives to investigate. According to his family, Ling was still studying at a certain school but could not provide conclusive evidence of innocence. Ling died from his injuries yesterday morning. The hospital notified the police station and the body was taken to the Tongren Funeral Home, awaiting family members to claim the body for burial today.

### Woman Who Murdered Her Husband Gives Birth in Prison

Zhang Er Guniang, a twenty-four-year-old woman from Jiangbei residing in a non-numbered bungalow in Hangzhou, on the night of February 21st of the 28th year of the Republic of China, colluded with her lover Pang Kaishi and, while her husband Bao Youqing was sound asleep, used an axe to shatter Bao's head and moved the body to a nearby pond. They then escaped together. In early March of the same year, Bao's body floated to the surface, and his mother-in-law, Zhang Zhou (i.e., Zhang Er Guniang's mother), identified the body and reported it to the police station, which arrested Pang Kaibao and sentenced him to death by the First Special Court. The appeal was also rejected. Zhang Er Guniang then secretly cohabited with Gao Yuanjia, a fellow townsman, and became pregnant. Recently, she was arrested by the Gordon Road police station, taken to the First Special Court, and prosecuted for murder. The trial was adjourned. The continued trial yesterday morning could not take place because the defendant, Zhang Er Guniang, gave birth in the detention center and could not appear in court. The court ordered an adjournment until the 21st of this month for further questioning.

### Digest of Robberies

At around 3:30 PM yesterday, five robbers came to No. 5, Lane 99, Mu Youming Road. Three of them were armed with guns and used intimidation to rob 1,500 yuan in national currency before fleeing with the loot.

At around 5:45 PM yesterday, three robbers suddenly arrived at a watch shop at No. 1745 Jing'an Temple Road. Each of them drew guns and prevented the shop assistants from making a sound. As a result, they searched the showcase and looted several pocket watches and wristwatches before leaving.

### Weather Report

According to the weather forecast from the Xujiahui Observatory at 3:30 PM yesterday, the weather around Shandong is clear to cloudy and very cold, with strong northwest to north winds. There is snowfall around Korea. Here, the sky is overcast with snowfall or sleet, with strong northeast to north winds. The weather will gradually clear in the afternoon. There is a strong cyclone in the East China Sea with rainfall, followed by strong seasonal winds. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, there were no records of the highest and lowest temperatures in Wuhu. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 58.1 and the lowest was 4.8.

### Remembering Mr. Xiong Deshan (3) - Nanhai

In the years 25 and 26, I traveled to Liangguang from time to time, and had many opportunities to meet with Mr. Xiong. Southwestern political figures such as Mr. Li Zongren and Mr. Li Jishen also had many opportunities to meet with him, but he had no intention of pursuing an official career. However, the Gui province authorities often consulted his opinions on southwestern political issues.

After the "August 13th" incident, he took his family to Gui from Shanghai. I was very worried about his health, but he said, "Now that the Japanese army has penetrated deep into China, every Chinese person should stand at their post, embrace the determination to sacrifice, and actively resist under the leadership of the sole leader, Chairman Jiang. Personal health is really nothing!" He went to Wuzhou and learned that Xida was closed and the Faculty of Arts and Law had been dismissed. At that time, the war had just begun, and he was struggling to find a place to settle his family, so he had to go to Guilin. He did not resume his professorship until Xida restored its old appearance in the 27th year. The North China University in Beiping moved to Chengdu and planned to hire him to be a professor in the Department of Sociology, but he declined due to illness. At that time, information was sparse. I only heard that during the Japanese air raids on Guilin, the house he lived in on Xincang Street was repeatedly bombed, and all his books were destroyed. He had no choice but to move with his illness to Dabuxiang in the countryside near Liangfeng. Medical treatment was inconvenient in the countryside, and his illness turned critical, leading to his death.

Ever since Mr. Xiong edited the Today's Magazine in Beijing, he had resolved to devote himself to scholarship. For many years, he worked hard consistently. His life and scholarship were always strict and arduous, which led to the gradual deterioration of his physical strength and severe neurasthenia. When he was a professor at the Dapuqiao College of Law and Politics, doctors already considered treatment difficult. When he was a professor of history at Xida, he only taught five or six hours a week, but he was very serious about editing his lectures, never being perfunctory. At the same time, he had to spend a lot of energy collecting reference materials and writing lecture notes to prepare for explanations in the classroom. This was how serious he was about being a professor. He studied a wide range of books in his childhood and had a very good foundation in old learning. In his middle age, he embraced socialism and had a deep understanding of methodology. He was also a meticulous person, so his achievements in history in his later years were mostly careful and precise, with few extravagant or rash claims. In this great era of resistance and reconstruction, although he did not directly go to the front line, he remained consistently loyal to scholarship and his own beliefs. From the perspective of a scholar, he fulfilled his greatest task.

Mr. Xiong's childhood name was Xuejun, his courtesy name was Desan. He changed his name to Kangnian when he studied in Japan, and later changed it to Deshan. He was born in Guangxu Ji Chou (1889) in Hao Xue Xiong Gang, Jiangling County, Hubei Province, and died on February 4th in the 28th year of the Republic of China, at the age of fifty. His wife, Ms. Deng Lichang, was from Jingde, Anhui Province. She lived in Jingzhou with her official husband. She was virtuous, diligent, and frugal, and taught her children the right way. She married Mr. Xiong on January 1st in the second year of the Republic of China. They had four sons. The eldest, Yongzhu, is twenty-four years old and is currently studying in the Department of Economics at Guangxi University. He is taciturn, hardworking, and able to carry on his father's legacy. The other three sons are still young. In addition, his wife and mother also lived in Dabuxiang in the countryside of Guilin. Mr. Xiong's funeral was simple, almost without anything for burial. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, the leaders of Guangxi, Huang Xuchu, the chairman of the province, as well as Zhang Huaijiu, Feng Yuxiang, and Yan Lisan, the acting chairman of Hubei Province, all sent generous contributions. Li Renzhong, Gan Jiaju, Li Da, Zhang Yingnan, and Xiong Zimin also acted as agents for his funeral affairs. These are all worthy of our gratitude. Mr. Xiong dedicated his life to the era. All that remains is a body of works and contributions in thought and scholarship.

(February 4th, in Hong Kong)

### Commercial News and Finance: Foreign Exchange Slightly Rebounds

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American exchange saw a slight decline, but speculators continued to sell in the morning, because foreign firms continued to buy, so the underlying trend tightened. Also, there were rumors that a certain bank wanted to forcibly join a certain association, which affected people's sentiment. Speculators suddenly bought American exchange again, so the volume of American exchange traded today was mostly at 5.40625 yuan. The closing result at noon was still flat. The spot British exchange was 3 pence 359375, and the American exchange was 5.40625 yuan, a decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

### Foreign Banks' Inflows Not Weak

At the beginning of the morning, the London large bills were flat in the near term and rose by 0.0625 in the far term. The New York silver price remained flat. The London gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rates between British and American exchange and between Shanghai exchange remained unchanged. The exchange rate between American and British exchange did not change, and it rose by 3 points against Shanghai exchange. The official exchange rates of the central bank remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price of British gold at 3 pence 375 and the American exchange at 5 You 375, which was the same as the closing price of the previous day. After opening, speculators sold again, and Huahank also sold, but Yuyou and other foreign firms had good appetites, so the price of American exchange for this month rose from 5.4375 yuan to 40625 yuan. HSBC's listed exchange rates were announced, and the exchange rates remained unchanged. There was no change in silver tax. Afterwards, because of rumors that a certain bank wanted to forcibly join a certain association, people's sentiment was slightly weak, so speculators re-entered the American exchange price for this month at 5.40625 yuan. It remained stable and unchanged until noon. The closing price for spot and this month's American exchange was 5.40625 yuan, and the British exchange was 3 pence 359375. The American exchange for next month was 5.375 yuan, and the British exchange was 3 pence 34375. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

### Cash Advances

Yesterday, the black market for smelted gold turned into a stalemate, from falling to rising, and finally falling again. Although there were rumors that a certain bank wanted to forcibly join a certain association, the swap from February to March will be held tomorrow (the 14th). The buyers have suffered losses in the previous session, and the sentiment of all parties is not easy to stabilize. After opening in the morning, the selling momentum was strong, and the market fell to 6,445 yuan. Upon hearing favorable rumors, securities firms, draft merchants, Xinyuan, and Hengji, etc., advanced their positions, and the price flew up to more than 6,500 yuan, once reaching 6,525 yuan. Finally, because sellers were active, those who saw high prices came out in droves, falling by 50 yuan, and the price rose by only 3 yuan. Half-day trading totaled 6,700 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The cash price rose again. Initially, it was said that the term price had been 45 yuan higher. Hengji then offered Baokang 50 taels, 50 yuan higher. The cash number offered Xianghe 200 taels 55 yuan higher. Fukangyong sold 50 taels to Xianghe, 55 yuan higher, and then 50 taels 60 yuan higher. Hengji offered another large 20 taels plus 60 yuan. Xiang Xingyong offered Hesheng 3 20 taels, 65 yuan higher. The prices of decorated gold and customs gold remained flat.

### Smelted Gold Rises by Three Yuan

At the beginning of the morning, the market outside the market after the previous day's late closing was still quite active, so the opening price was only 6,470 yuan, 7 yuan smaller than the previous day. After opening, the price rose by 20 yuan thanks to the efforts of retail investors, to 6,490 yuan. When the foreign exchange market opened, it continued to be in a selling mood, causing Ren Chen, Chen Shui, Xinfeng, and Yong to sell vigorously, falling to 6,445 yuan. After a period of hovering, favorable rumors suddenly spread, and foreign exchange also slightly weakened, so the buying wind suddenly rose. China, Tongkangyong, Sui Fu, and Xinyuan all frantically bought, and the price was raised out of the 6,500 yuan mark, reaching 6,510 yuan. However, Yi Shi, Baokang, Xinfeng, and Yong took advantage of the high price and sold again, so it re-entered the 500 yuan mark, falling to 6,485 yuan. Afterwards, relying on Hengji, Dafeng, and others to pull again, it rose to the high peak of 6,525 yuan for the whole day. However, Chengren and the customers of the silver shop wanted to sell again, pressing it down to 6,475 yuan. The noon closing was 6,480 yuan, only 3 yuan higher than the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon. The half-day fluctuation was 80 yuan. Based on the settlement price of 5.40625 yuan for the US dollar, it was about 6,441 yuan, a rise of about 40 yuan. The retail price of the cash number's own brand of gold must be 70 yuan higher than the term price, and the purchase price is 40 yuan lower than the selling price. The current premium for gold is still without a price.

### No Rise or Fall in Decorative Gold

The selling price of silver shop decorative gold per tael has not risen or fallen. Da Tonghang still lists it at 670 yuan, and the new Tonghang is similar to the previous price. The purchase price is 30 yuan lower, it is said.

### No Significant Rise or Fall in Foreign Currencies

In yesterday's foreign currency market, the market price of smelted gold fluctuated, and finally remained the same as the previous day. British and American gold pounds remained stable. British gold notes remained unchanged. The market price stood flat. The American gold note rose from 18.12 to 18.25, but then fell back to 18.18, a slight increase of four points compared to the previous day. There was still a need for Hong Kong notes, and the market price continued to rise. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes were even, and the market price stood flat. The evening market was still 1.725 yuan. There was a slight need for Korean notes, and the market price rose slightly. The evening market was 1.33 yuan.

### Grain: Rice Continues to Arrive, Rice Price Around Half a Yuan

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson & Co.'s vessel, the Yisheng, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the holiday, carrying 4,470 bags from Hong Kong. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf and began unloading yesterday. The Taikoo & Co.'s vessel, the Hunan, arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, also carrying 3,671 bags from Hong Kong. It is scheduled to sail to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession today to unload.

After foreign rice turned weak, although there was no major change, it has been falling continuously for several days. The market situation is weak. Merchants are wary of excessive inventory and are adopting a cautious approach, unwilling to rush into the market. On the other hand, they are also unwilling to lightly sell. Yesterday, in the sales market, only local shops were adding to their purchases. Sellers were unwilling to loosen their prices, so the overall situation from morning to noon remained hovering between three and five jiao. The closing price, compared to the previous market, except for small gains in prices, there was not much change. Other goods fell by about half a yuan. Foreign merchants were still selling in the market. It is said that there are 3,000 tons of broken rice for sale at 73 yuan. The market rose and then fell, and the result was slightly lower than before. However, large futures traders are holding firm, and the market remains stable. No. 1 Saigon February is 93.5 yuan, Xiaojiao is currently 86 yuan, January is 86 to 87 yuan, and February is 86.5 yuan. 6-700 tons were traded, and 8,000 bags of spot were opened.

Domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica rice, was affected by foreign rice, and sales were sluggish. Therefore, sellers were unable to push prices up, and selling prices continued to depreciate by half a yuan. Changbang Yuanbai japonica rice opened at 105 yuan, 105 yuan, and a special appearance was 102.5 yuan, 102 yuan. Kunshan Yuanbai japonica rice was 103.5 yuan, 103 yuan, and a special appearance was 100 yuan, 98.5 yuan. Qingjiao thin indica rice, a special appearance was 94 yuan, 93.5 yuan.

The sales of glutinous rice also turned scarce yesterday, and sellers were eager to sell, so the market was difficult to sustain. The price fell by nearly one yuan. Hong Kong special round grains opened at 81 yuan, 80 yuan, and Zhongguan was 79.5 yuan, 78.5 yuan.

### Fewer Flour Imports

The foreign flour market is showing a weakening trend because a large number of goods are on the way and will arrive soon. The supply of goods transshipped from Hong Kong is also continuous. Merchants' buying appetite is getting weaker, and sentiment is becoming more and more sluggish. In this area, there is still plenty of cheap flour supply, so the demand for foreign flour is even weaker. The entire market only opened with more than 500 bags of Lock Tower brand Australian flour, which has fallen into the 24 yuan mark. The price opened at 23.8 yuan, another decrease of 0.2 jiao compared to the previous day. The Beautiful brand was offered at 24 yuan. I heard that 200 bags of matching goods had been received. The cheap flour from the Yan factory is still 20 yuan for the local street to sell in small quantities.

### Countless Malpractices by Rice Merchants

Since the price of rice has soared tenfold, not only rice merchants and hoarders have profited handsomely, but the malpractices of Chinese and foreign ordering merchants are also very deep. There are no fewer than ten Chinese and foreign trading houses ordering rice. Ordering a ship of rice, from two to three thousand tons to seven or eight thousand tons, can earn a profit of one hundred thousand to two hundred seventy-eight thousand ninety thousand yuan. Each ton is estimated to have a profit of more than forty yuan, which is a huge amount exceeding the legal profit. According to the price in Saigon, the origin is about US$2.9 per 100 kilograms, plus a legal commission of 5%, US$0.145, shipping cost US$0.45, and insurance US$0.2, totaling US$3.695. Why is the Shanghai price 80 yuan outside? The secret of this is to be disclosed to the public.

(1) The hefty commission of Chinese and foreign ordering merchants controls the Shanghai rice market, and they do not do it without hefty profits. At least a 10% commission is charged, and 40% of the deposit is collected before the transaction is made, disregarding the authorities' legal profit of 5% and increasing the burden on citizens.

(2) Taking advantage of tricks. Whenever Shanghai's inventory is low, the market is soaring, and people are panicked, they often disregard credibility. According to the CIF example, they re-ship from the origin and settle the surplus difference, or sell spot goods to a third country, creating a food crisis in this port. Last year's Saigon No. 1 rice has not yet arrived, which is one example. General Chinese merchants are especially shameless. When the market rises, Xiaojiao rice is delivered to Dajiao rice, Hao rice is delivered to No. 1 rice, and No. 3 rice is delivered to Hao rice. The 40% deposit has become a fact, and they take whatever they want, regardless of the pain of others.

(3) Shortage of Weight: The law strictly prohibits unscrupulous merchants from shortchanging and deceiving customers, but it is a strange thing that the ordering merchants, when acting as officials, are shortchanging. Each bag weighs about 100 kilograms (there are large and small bags), and each ton has about 1,000 bags with zero. If you order 100 tons of foreign rice, and pay 80 yuan of legal currency per 100 kilograms, you pay a deposit of 12,000 yuan. When the ship arrives, you pay 1,015 bags and pay 48,000 yuan to be sufficient. However, the foreign firm must demand the remaining 15 bags of 1,200 yuan, pulling the original price of 81.2 yuan per bag. This 1.2 yuan is the unnamed loss of shortage of weight. In fact, what the Shanghai rice merchants ordered is the tonnage of 100 tons, regardless of whether it is 1,000 + tens of bags, and it is included in the tonnage. Therefore, it is calculated that 1,015 bags is 100 tons, without shortage of weight. Calculated with 1,000 bags plus 15 bags, each bag is short of 3 kilograms. In addition, the losses at the Shanghai docks are even more absurd. Chinese merchants actually deliver with 1,000 bags and sell the remaining 15 bags separately.

(4) Exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees. Chinese and foreign ordering merchants charge miscellaneous fees, including insurance, military insurance, special military insurance, additional military insurance, foreign exchange swap losses, and various other fees. In fact, what the Shanghai rice merchants order is delivery at the Shanghai warehouse, Shanghai legal currency, and everything else should be borne by the seller, and they should not demand it on the pretext. They collude with brokers and issue cost notifications indiscriminately.

Since the authorities of the two concessions are determined to eliminate the malpractices of rice merchants, it seems that they should not sit idly by and let the malpractices of ordering merchants reduce costs and alleviate the people's difficulties. They should order Chinese and foreign ordering merchants to submit the original English and Chinese documents of the origin, verify the original weight, submit the origin's insurance policy and military insurance policy and all expense bills, prepare a cost bill, and stipulate legal profits, so that the foundation can be strengthened, the source can be cleaned up, the price can be evaluated and limited, and there will be a real meaning.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Without Special Features, Actual Sales Still Sluggish

The yarn market is unpredictable, but actual transactions remain sluggish. The shorts are still active. As for the longs, because they have fallen back by more than 100 yuan, they think it has reached a considerable level and may as well buy again, so the long and short sides see it differently. At present, most people's psychology is to sell when it rises and buy when it is weak, so the ups and downs of yarn are still huge. The highest price was 1,425 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,396 yuan. In the afternoon, the price started at 1,412 yuan, and the average was 1,406 yuan. On the 13th, 40 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Yangon and 25 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

Shuangma opened in the morning. Because the popularity of the market turned high in the afternoon of the previous day, there were more buyers in the market. The first-board price was 1,410 yuan, a slight increase to 1,415 yuan. Then, because of short selling and settlements, the market suddenly turned downwards, to a low price of 1,396 yuan. At this point, short covering and temporary large amounts of orders resumed their activities, rising by 400 yuan. At the same time, the securities firms and gold firms became stronger, and rumors suddenly rose, all of which were favorable. In an instant, it rose to 1,425 yuan, but actual sales were still sluggish and without special features. Those who profited settled, and then fell back to 1,405 yuan. The closing price was 1,408 yuan. The statistics of the half-day transactions totaled 7,560 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 14 yuan. There were no transactions with the customer firms.

### Japanese Factories Order from Overseas, Local Cotton Difficult to Raise

The current cotton situation is still not improving. This is because the yarn market is sluggish, and Japanese factories have no purchases at all. Most of them order directly from overseas, which is much cheaper, so it is very difficult for the cotton market to rise. On the 13th, 50 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.

In other news, the overseas cotton market, the New York cotton market, rose in the morning due to purchases by speculators and spot merchants. Afterwards, the closing price fell by 3-4 pounds due to some reactive selling. The Indian market was flat. Yesterday, the forecast was for a fall of one rupee.

The transactions of imported cotton in Shanghai have been very quiet recently. Because of the straight fall in cotton yarn, the cotton market has not improved. However, according to the current market situation, the cotton price will not fall as sharply as the yarn price, because the inventory of raw cotton on the market is not as excessive as that of cotton yarn.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Falling Continuously, Industry Players Add to Positions

The factory cloth market turned firm after falling yesterday. This is because the sharp fall in the past few days has caused customers to purchase and industry players to cover their positions. The holders are also raising prices and unwilling to sell cheaply, so the selling pressure has slightly rebounded. White coarse cloth has rebounded by about 0.15 yuan per bolt, and fine cloth and fine twill have risen by about 0.5 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth remains flat. The local street traded more than 300 pieces of various cloths. Zhejiang firms traded more than 100 pieces of Fuchou and Shilin cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong firms traded more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, coarse cloth, and bleached cloth. Today, 365 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong and 11 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin.

Because the yarn price rebounded yesterday, the East cloth market turned firm. The spot market for white goods, cage heads, and fine cloth has been changed to full-day operation, rising and falling sharply, hovering around 47 yuan. The closing price was 47.1 yuan. (Exchange) The closing price for futures in the afternoon was 47.6 yuan for February, 49.11 yuan for March, 50.066 yuan for April, and 51.4 yuan for May.

### Securities: Bond Market Still Weak

The unofficial market for public bonds: yesterday, rumors suddenly arose in the port, and people's sentiment was already unstable. After being hit, it became even weaker. The market was flat and weak in the morning, and a sharp drop occurred in the afternoon, falling by more than one yuan. The market was mostly floating and unreal, and weak. A slight rumor would cause a fall, because many in the financial sector have surrendered in recent days, and the footing is too loose. Also, there are not many powerful people this year, so the formation is easily shaken. Yesterday morning, most of the sellers, such as Nos. 16 Xinhua, 38 Hengkang, and Tiansheng Hongda Zhenkang, were spot outflows. Renchang and Hu bought a lot, but they were afraid that it would be difficult to maintain. The noon closing was quite flat and weak. In the afternoon, there was a matter of the Market Chamber of Commerce, which had nothing to do with the bond market, but one virtuality led to a hundred virtualities, and most people turned pale at the mention of it, which caused an unnecessary fall. The resales of Tongkang, Hengfu, Lianyi, Yuxing, Hengkang, Hongda, and Renchang filled the market with selling pressure, while the buyers, such as Tongxing Lianhe and Juxin, were mostly covering their positions. Some retail investors bought in small quantities, and the market price fell sharply by more than one yuan. As a result, all were less than one yuan. Category D was down by 0.15 jiao in the morning because it was not done in the afternoon. The turnover was about 3.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

In stock trading, 100 shares of China Match Company were traded at a price of 34.25 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Oilseed Cakes Continue to Rise

Yesterday's spot transactions of oilseed cakes were still very few. The futures market was entirely controlled by speculation. The trend of the day, first inheriting the previous day's weak situation, the oil market fell by another yuan, and the bean cakes continued to fall by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao. After entering, the market price rose repeatedly due to the usual style of the four firms. As a result, the futures oil exceeded the previous day's market price, and the futures cake also turned up beyond expectations. 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 2,000 containers of Jiangbei local workshop total raw oil, 200 loads of Dayou factory bean oil, and 30 barrels of current Dalian oil were opened, with 100 barrels ordered for delivery in the lower part of February, 200 barrels in the upper part of March, 150 barrels in the lower part of March, and more than 60,000 pieces of various brands of futures cake.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate Slightly

Yesterday's sugar market was generally flat. The public association's prices for spot: 4 coarse white, 81 yuan for local warehouse, 80.8 yuan for foreign warehouse, lacked ups and downs. The order at the end of February was softer at 81 to 80.9 yuan, and the order for March + 10 days was 81.2 to 81.15 jiao, and a small 2.5 jiao. Dutch cotton white KD brand local warehouse was 80 yuan, and Dutch red was 62.5 yuan, down 0.5 jiao. Tai brand white B brand order in February + 10 days was 80 yuan, DY brand West warehouse was 78.6 jiao, up 0.2 jiao, and East warehouse was 78 yuan. HX brand was 78.3 jiao, up 0.1 jiao. The Benchang cotton white Zhenji No. 4 goods opened at 74.5 yuan, No. 1 ice was 102.5 yuan, and Jingming ice was 103.5 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. Guotang Diaoging rose slightly because it had been in short supply for a long time, but there were no transactions.

### Medicinal Materials: Tangerine Peel Stock Near Exhaustion, New Goods催装未到

Because the source of Qiaohong tangerine peel has been lacking for a long time, the stock on the market is almost exhausted. It is found that only Chen Ju has a little stock. The price has risen by more than ten yuan, but it has not yet been traded. New goods cannot be delivered due to inconvenient transportation. Although telegrams have been sent to urge delivery, they have not yet arrived. The first market is bound to be expensive.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Market Still Quiet

Yesterday, the overseas silk market in Yokohama fell across the board. The spot price fell to 1,360 yuan, the near-term price was 1,363 yuan, and the far-term

### Approval for Increased Gas Price - Investigation into Gas Costs - Temporary Surcharge Increased by 92% - Limited to Three Months with Provisions

The Shanghai Gas Company of the Public Concession has applied to the authorities of the two concessions to increase the temporary surcharge from 158% to 250% from the 15th of this month, limited to three months, due to the soaring price of gas and insufficient operating surplus to maintain shareholder interests. The matter will be re-examined at that time based on the general situation. It is now learned that the authorities of the two concessions have approved the company's request, but with the following provisions:

Revising Rates After Three Months

(1) The rate shall be re-established before April 15, 1941, after investigation according to the provisions of Section 3 below.

(4) The minimum consumption volume on household gas bills shall be increased to 1,500 cubic feet. As for industrial users, their minimum sales volume shall be equal to 20% of the monthly nominal quota per meter.

Separate Office for Concession Appliances

(5) The company may temporarily suspend the rental of appliances, and new users shall purchase them from the company at cost. However, when this method is implemented, if existing users request to move their appliances elsewhere, the company shall not recognize them as new users, and the repair costs of the appliances shall still be borne by the users. The company shall rent the gas meters to the users while retaining ownership of the meters. (6) The current reduced fee method for users who use gas for heating, hot water, and cooking purposes shall be cancelled.

### China Resolves to Block Japan's Southern Advance - Mr. Song Ziwen's Remarks in New York

The North-China Daily News reports: Dr. Song Ziwen delivered a speech at the China Institute in New York on January 23, discussing the difficulties encountered by the Japanese army in the Sino-Japanese War. According to Song, China's vast territory and potential manpower will make it impossible for the invaders to carry out their blitzkrieg tactics. Although the other side initially hoped to devastate all of China within a few months, this plan ultimately failed. The following is a summary of Mr. Song's speech.

About seven years ago, on my way to London to attend the economic conference, I discussed with you the issue of the Japanese army's seizure of Manchuria. At that time, I said that although the Manchurian issue was not considered urgent by some, it was the first international act of plunder in many years. If it is not condemned, its impact will create a precedent for similar illegal acts elsewhere, until the whole world is engulfed in a common conflagration. When I arrived in London, I spoke with the same sentiment to the China Aid Committee of the House of Commons, which was chaired by Foreign Secretary Sir Simon. I quoted a passage from the historical essay by the British writer Macaulay, which described how Frederick the Great seized Silesia from Austria after years of peace in Europe, thus causing the "Seven Years' War," and the war spread almost all over the world. "Blacks fought on the coast of Cameroon, and Indians killed each other on the shores of the Great Lakes in North America." When we see today's world in the midst of war.

Deeply Pleased that China's Leaders are Talented

I am deeply grieved that what I said seven years ago has unfortunately come true. But I am pleased to recall the second point I made at the time, namely that Japan's aggression would become a hammer forging China's unity, and that China would find its national soul at the cost of blood, flesh, and material losses. It is fortunate that China has leaders such as General Chiang Kai-shek to lead everything in the greatest crisis of national life. Under the combination of Hitler, Mussolini, and Konoe, we are fortunate to have outstanding leaders such as Churchill and General Chiang Kai-shek, and great figures such as Roosevelt as their supporters. We often think that General Chiang Kai-shek is only a soldier, but in fact, Chiang is not only a soldier, but also a politician who understands the intricate factors in the war, as well as the various political and material forces within it. We must note that it is better to call Chiang a politician than a soldier. Chiang is very different from the Japanese warlords, because Chiang does not use war as a means to achieve the goals desired by politicians.

Japan's Aggression is Reckless

In 1937, when Japan launched a war against China, it was a reckless act. At that time, Konoe told some of his own people and foreign reporters that he would make China kneel in three months. What he meant was the so-called "blitzkrieg" that is generally called today. But the Japanese only know about themselves and do not know about others. We know that time is on China's side. Time will exhaust Japan's resources, because it is self-evident that the Japanese resources will be exhausted to maintain its world's third largest navy, as well as the supply of millions of troops and thousands of aircraft in a state of war. The Chinese nation must take a considerable amount of time to exert its huge and solid strength, and time can enable the democratic countries to understand that China's combat is not only for its own interests, but also for the common interests of the democratic countries. The democratic countries will be happy to help China when they are aware of this.

Unable to Control Occupied Areas

Today, if you look at the map of China, you will see a huge ugly shape, which is generally called the Japanese-occupied area, but the Japanese occupation of these lands is only a superficial state. Although the major cities are occupied by the Japanese, the land a few miles outside the city is still in the hands of the Chinese government. The Chinese government collects taxes, circulates currency, issues orders, and adjudicates lawsuits. At the same time, although the Japanese occupy railways and some important highways, there are Chinese troops and guerrillas stationed on both sides of the roads, who constantly destroy bridges, demolish rails, and ambush and annihilate the most distant outposts of the Japanese army. The west reaches Yichang, but in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, etc., there are several Chinese regular armies just a few miles away.

Southern Ambitions are Like a Dream

The agreement recently signed by the Axis powers to divide spheres of influence is like the attempt by Spain and Portugal in 1493 to divide the world. The objects that Japan has been assigned are vast in area, including China and various parts of the South Pacific, such as Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Burma, India, Australia and New Zealand. This is truly like a greedy golden dream. But Japan has not even gotten its hands on the fortifications, even Singapore has not been captured. If the port does not have the British main fleet, and only relies on the naval detachments of Australia and the Netherlands for protection, it will naturally not be a match for the enemy with Japan's entire navy and air force and the army as a backup. If Singapore is attacked, the massive and formidable battle fleet of the United States must of course be taken into account, but in Japan's mind, it is attacking Singapore at the same time as its Axis partners are attacking Britain, Gibraltar and Suez, which will aggravate the Atlantic crisis, and the United States may turn a blind eye to Singapore. Although Japan's fleet and air force are still intact, its army is not enough to support and consolidate a huge southern advance plan.

Repeatedly Seeking Peace is a Conspiracy

According to estimates by military experts in neutral countries, the number of Japanese soldiers who have died in battle, died of illness, and been permanently disabled in China is more than 1.1 million. In addition, there are still 1.25 million troops tied down in China, not counting the Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria to defend against the Soviet Union. Therefore, military experts believe that because the soldiers who have gone to war have not returned, there is little encouragement for new adventures in Japan. (To be continued)

### Trade Commission Approves Exchange Rates for US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars - Importers and Exporters Calculate Using the Same Method

Since August 1 last year, the Ministry of Finance has approved the listed exchange rates of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. After changing the exchange rate for British gold to four and a half pence, the listed exchange rates for US dollars and Hong Kong dollars have been approved by the Trade Commission: (1) The listed exchange rate for US dollars is fixed at 7.5 yuan; (2) The listed exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars is fixed at 3.33 yuan. However, both exporters and importers must calculate using the same method to avoid differences.
