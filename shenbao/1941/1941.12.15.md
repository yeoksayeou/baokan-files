Haitong News Agency, Special Dispatch from This Port, 14th: According to a broadcast from Manila, authoritative sources in London claim that Japanese troops in Malaya are only 150 miles from Singapore. The size of the Japanese reinforcements is still unknown, but it is said to be substantial.

Havas News Agency, London, 14th: Regarding the Malayan war, Reuters' Singapore correspondent reports that British troops in Malaya are facing significant difficulties in their fight against the Japanese. While official communiqués remain silent about the frontline battles, it is an undeniable fact that the Jitra area is preparing for a fierce battle. Japanese troops advanced into the area from Thailand two days ago, and the fighting is taking place in dense forests. The Japanese army has overcome difficulties in this mountainous terrain, swimming across rivers in several engagements and appearing behind British lines. Japanese infantry also have lightly motorized units supporting them along the railway lines. As for the British forces, including Indian, English, and Scottish units, they are fighting bravely, determined to resist to the last man and the last bullet. The British air force, originally intended to prevent Japanese landings, is now also assisting infantry operations, but unfortunately, the air force cannot exert its power in the dense jungle areas, so infantry must rely on their own strength in the northern region. In addition, Australian, British, and Dutch fleets are attacking Japanese concentrations in areas without jungle cover, and Japanese motorized units are also being targeted for bombardment. As for other areas on the Malayan front, the situation remains unchanged. 600 women and children have been evacuated from Penang Island and efforts are being made to send them to safer locations.

The Japanese General Headquarters announced this morning that the Japanese army has begun attacking Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong area has been subjected to continuous attacks by Japanese aircraft for the past few days.

### German-Soviet War Stalled; Quiet on Libyan Front

Havas News Agency, Switzerland, 13th: According to a dispatch from the "Basler Nachrichten" correspondent in Berlin, German public opinion is focused on the war in the Pacific. The Eastern Front war has stalled due to the winter and is being viewed with indifference. As for the Libyan war, news is scarce. British Prime Minister Churchill's speech shows that the British acknowledge that their planned military objectives have not been achieved. All parties in Germany have complete confidence in General Rommel, commander of the Axis forces in Libya. Hitler's recent speech only mentioned General Rommel's name. British claims of victory are only of a local nature, and a war of attrition is now taking place.

### Finland's Diplomatic Relations with the U.S.; Finland Claims No Consideration of Severance

Havas News Agency, Helsinki, 13th: A government spokesman stated that neither Finland nor the United States has considered severing diplomatic relations. Commentators believe that Finland is unlikely to change its attitude towards the U.S., as approximately 300,000 Finnish nationals reside in the U.S., accounting for about one-tenth of the country's population, and the two countries have close ties. However, while Finland is at war with the Soviet Union, it maintains close relations with Germany, making it difficult to avoid disputes with the United States. According to some diplomatic circles, future developments will depend on the war between Japan and the Soviet Union. If Britain and the United States request Soviet assistance in the war against Japan, Finland will be forced to take a clear stance, declare war on the United States, or at least sever diplomatic relations with the United States.

### Traditional Education Professor Discusses the Scientific Outlook on Life (Continued from the 8th)

The Joys and Sorrows of Life

"The Process of Life": Based on the results discussed earlier, life still requires stimulation. When encountering stimulation, one must find ways to overcome it. The difference between humans and cats is that stimulation becomes increasingly refined, and the methods of overcoming stimulation become increasingly ingenious, making the new recovery more beautiful and good. "What are joys and sorrows?" Life itself has no joys or sorrows. Joys and sorrows are subjective feelings in human psychology toward the external world. Other animals and humans in the same environment will not have the same feelings of joy or sorrow. Two people cannot have the same subjectivity toward the same event. Joy is the satisfaction of needs, and sorrow can be said to be the failure to achieve satisfaction after considerable effort. Therefore, joys and sorrows cannot be separated. There is no joy without sorrow in the world, and no sorrow without joy. "Is life sorrowful?" The answer is that this world, this life, is the most likely pleasant world. Only in this world can there be joy. We acknowledge that this world is sorrowful. Sakyamuni said that there are eight kinds of sorrows in life: birth, old age, sickness, death, separation from loved ones, meeting with enemies, not getting what one seeks, and the suffering of the five aggregates. But I also feel that there are eight joys in life: the joy of birth, the joy of youth, the joy of peace, the joy of immortality, the joy of meeting loved ones, the joy of separating from enemies, the joy of gaining knowledge, and the joy of the five aggregates being in harmony. In short, reducing desires can reduce sorrow, and developing culture can increase joy. But life is a process of constant struggle. Success in struggle is joy, and failure in struggle is sorrow.

The Purpose of Life

"Stages of Life Development": From a psychological or cultural-historical perspective, the physical world comes first. Material conditions should be fully prepared. Next is the physiological stage, using instinctive behaviors to satisfy the necessary conditions for maintaining life. Then comes the psychological world, accumulating past experiences to solve present difficulties and open up future paths. Finally, there is the spiritual world, seeking higher values beyond maintaining one's own life and continuing the lineage, such as the scientist's pursuit of truth, the artist's pursuit of beauty, and the religious person's pursuit of goodness. "Trends in Life Development": From the absence of self-expression to the unconscious absolute control by the natural world, self-awareness gradually arises, then advancing to self-domination of the outside world but inability to dominate the inner world, and finally progressing to simultaneously dominating the outside world and dominating the self. "The Purpose of Life" is for humanity to prolong our lives by dominating the natural world, and then to control the inner world to seek the highest values of truth, beauty, and goodness. "How to achieve this goal" lies in both expanding the self and destroying the self. This has already touched on the question of how we should act in a play. There are probably three views on this: (1) Why not take off the costume and return to my original self? "This is fundamentally impossible." (2) Why not just act carelessly, finish the play, and be done with it? The result is being scolded by other actors and having teacups thrown by the audience, and there will be no good ending. (3) Although it is acting, it might as well pretend to be real. The actor is happy, and the audience is excited. Why not do it? Moreover, if one acts earnestly on stage, I think one can still be said to be a good person off stage. (End)

After the outbreak of the Pacific War, banks and other financial institutions in Shanghai restricted deposits and withdrawals. This has lasted for a week, and now things are gradually returning to normal. After being ordered to resume business, Chinese and foreign banks complied with the Shanghai Municipal Council's instructions. The Council's restrictions on deposits and withdrawals were originally limited to three days. However, due to the adjustment of finances, it was impossible to complete the preparations in a short time. Therefore, the restrictions were extended for another three days starting from the day before yesterday (the 13th), and all Chinese and foreign banks will lift the restrictions and restore their previous business status tomorrow (the 16th). Withdrawals will be paid using a transfer system. For foreign businesses, the Yokohama Specie Bank will handle check clearing. For Chinese businesses, the Shanghai Check Clearing House will continue to handle it. Various industry trading markets are also holding meetings to discuss resuming operations. It is understood that all markets will resume trading within a day or two.

### Shooting Incident Occurred on Avenue Petain Yesterday Morning

One Japanese person shot in the neck; tight security in the extra-settlement area afterward

Near Yidingpan Road on Avenue Petain in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Area, at around 10:25 AM yesterday, a Japanese person was passing by when he was shot in the neck. He immediately bled profusely, fell to the ground, and was injured. The assailant then fled with the weapon and disappeared without a trace. The injured person was then taken to Fumin No. 2 Hospital on Yuyuan Road for treatment. It is said that the injuries were minor and not life-threatening. After the incident, martial law was imposed in the Shanghai West area, blocking traffic and searching pedestrians. As of dusk, things had not yet returned to normal. It is understood that barbed wire fences were set up at the junctions of Singapore Road, Jiaozhou Road, Connaught Road, and Yanping Road. Traffic on Quanxi Road, Haig Road, and Yuyuan Road within the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple Police Station was also blocked. Pedestrians and vehicles of all kinds were prohibited from passing until midnight, when they were still not opened.

### Four Paper-Wrapped Handguns Were All Fake

At the entrance of Lane 248, opposite No. 351, Avenue Albert, French Concession, at around 2:30 PM yesterday, a paper package was found containing four handguns. Someone reported it to the French Police. When the police arrived to open it, although the four guns had exquisite and novel designs, they were all made of wood and were fake. The police then took them back to the police station for destruction.

### Daylight Lamp Fee Rate

The French Municipal Council's Board of Directors reviewed the report of the Chief of the Technical and Political Office and recognized that daylight lamps have reasons for increasing electricity costs due to technical factors. It was resolved to allow the company to implement the following measures: A. For existing installation users, they may choose one of the following two: Pay an additional 30% of the normal rate due to power reasons; or install a single-coil transformer on all equipment that can indicate the Cos value, the limit of which will be negotiated by the Municipal Council and the company in the future. B. For new equipment, equipment with a Cos value less than the limit must not be connected to the power lines.

### Rental Cars Cease Operations

Xiangsheng, Yunfei, Tailai, and Yinse, the four rental car companies in Shanghai, have had their stored fuel tanks sealed. They were only able to operate on the small amount of fuel stored in the cylinders. As of the 13th, all of it had been used up. Therefore, they had no choice but to announce their closure one after another. The four rental car companies have a total of 400 cars: 125 for Xiangsheng, 120 for Yunfei, 65 for Yinse, and 90 for Tailai. Among them, only Yinse was newly established after the war, while Xiangsheng is a giant in the industry, with nine branches. It is heard that other smaller rental car companies have also mostly closed down due to the depletion of gasoline. Therefore, it is temporarily impossible to use rental cars for transportation in Shanghai.

### Robbery Incidents Recorded

At No. 631, Zhoujiazui Road, Shanghai East, at around 11:00 AM yesterday, seven robbers broke in, four of whom were armed with guns, and prohibited any noise. They robbed cash and clothes estimated to be worth 3,500 yuan.

At a Western clothing store at No. 182, Hubei Road, at 7:20 PM last night, three robbers came, two of whom showed handguns, threatened and intimidated, and robbed nine bolts of woolen fabric, estimated to be worth 18,000 yuan.

### Impoverished Man Hangs Himself

At the iron window of the entrance of Lane 456, Avenue Edward VII, at around 9:30 PM last night, a man wearing blue cloth shirt and trousers, about forty years old, suddenly committed suicide by hanging himself due to poverty and inability to survive. Someone called the detectives from Lao Zha Police Station No. 116 to the scene. They transported the body to Renji Hospital for transfer to the coroner's office for examination.

### Postal Rates Increased Starting Today

Shanghai Postal Administration Announcement No. 1720: From December 15th of the 30th year, the first rate (delivery within the jurisdiction of each bureau), the second rate (mutual mailing between domestic bureaus), the fourth rate (Japan, Korea, Kwantung Leased Territory, and Taiwan), and the fifth rate (Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhouwan Leased Territory) listed in the postage rate table for various types of mail will be increased by 100% of the original rate.

### News from the Hubei Native Place Association

Relief for Disaster-Stricken Compatriots at Ping An Inn: The Ping An Inn on Zhubao San Road in this city was accidentally set on fire by a negligent paper shop next door on November 29th. All the buildings were burned down. The details have been repeatedly reported in various newspapers in this city. All the travelers were awakened from their dreams, scrambling to escape for their lives. All their luggage and clothing could not be taken out. At this time of severe winter, they were hungry and cold, a truly pitiful situation. The Ping An Inn mainly housed refugees from various places who brought their families with them, as well as small-scale merchants and peddlers. Most of them were from Hubei Province. The Hubei Native Place Association in Shanghai has initiated the organization of the Hubei Native Place Association Preparatory Committee for the Relief of Disaster-Stricken Compatriots in the Ping An Inn Fire to provide relief. In recent days, members of the association have been voluntarily donating money. In addition to providing particularly generous condolences to the dead and injured, those who are being sent back to their hometowns are given 160 yuan per female, 150 yuan per male, and 60 yuan per child under eight years old. Over 300 people have already been sent back.

### Fire on Avenue Joffre

At 3:50 AM yesterday, a Russian business on Avenue Joffre, No. 809, French Concession, suddenly caught fire. The fire brigade was notified and rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which took an hour to extinguish. As a result, two rooms were burned down. The cause of the fire is unknown.

### First Special District Court Has Not Resumed Office; Everything Inside Remains the Same and There Are No Changes

The First Special District Court in this city (North Zhejiang Road) was taken over by the Japanese army on the 8th of this month. The remaining inspectors and all staff members, as well as the families of the hospitalized, were still allowed to move freely. Only three soldiers were stationed outside the hospital gate for protection. The temporary office of the First Special District Court in the Zhirenyong Girls' School on Weihaiwei Road and Seymour Road, and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chengdu Road, were only occupied and protected by the Japanese army until the morning of the 10th. However, these courts have not been able to resume court sessions immediately due to various reasons and are still in a state of suspension. It is rumored that court sessions will continue on Monday, the 15th of this month, but the time is probably not enough. Since the court stopped operating on the 8th, all the criminals captured by the police stations have been temporarily detained in the police stations and have not been interrogated. Therefore, once the court resumes operation, the cases handed over by the police stations on the first day will inevitably be extremely crowded.

### West Qing Basketball Tournament Continues Tonight: Two Games in Group B

Shanghai Bank vs. West Qing Monarch Blue and White vs. Chen You; Blue and White Withdraws from Group A Due to Insufficient Players

The 14th West Qing Basketball Tournament, which was suspended for a week last week, is scheduled to continue tonight, but the time has been advanced to start at 6:20 PM. There will still be three games. Tonight, there will be two Group B games. Shanghai Bank will play West Qing Monarch (Kings). Both teams are making their first appearance. The latter has exceptionally strong strength and aspires to win the championship. There is bound to be a bloody battle when they meet. In the second game, Blue and White B will meet Chen You. The former is the incarnation of a strong star and its strength should not be underestimated. Chen You's lineup is weaker, and Blue and White B is expected to win. The finale was originally scheduled to be Group A Blue and White A vs. Lianxing. The meeting of the two giants in the game is no less than the final. It is expected to be exciting. Unfortunately, most of the soldiers under Blue and White are students from various universities. Due to the end of the semester, they have left Shanghai and returned to their hometowns. Now there are only three or four team members left, and they cannot form a team. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the West Qing organizers stating their withdrawal. It is a pity that Blue and White was very confident in winning the championship in Group A. The departure of a strong opponent from the group has increased Lianxing's chances of winning the championship. The order of the two Group B games tonight is as follows:

Monarch - Shanghai Bank Team 6:20 PM

Blue and White B - Chen You Team 7:15 PM

### Situation of Each Group in the Da Zhong School Small Ball Tournament; Games Suspended Due to Rain Yesterday

The Da Zhong School Small Ball League, which has been underway for a month since its opening, originally had six games scheduled for yesterday from 1:00 PM, but due to inclement weather and continuous drizzle, the games could not be played and were all postponed. According to the recent situation announced by the organizers, in the university group, Aurora has taken the lead with three wins in three games, followed closely by Pudong with two wins in two games. In addition, Fanhuang also remains undefeated. The championship seat in the future will probably be among these three teams. In High School A, Aurora A also holds the top spot firmly with three wins in all three games, and the remaining teams cannot match it. In High School B, Guangxia and Aurora B each have five points and are tied for first place. Jinlian is in third place with two wins and one loss. In Junior High A and B groups, Aurora and St. Francis are in the leading position. However, Guangxia and Xuhui in Junior B have not been defeated and are eyeing the top spot, so St. Francis cannot be optimistic. The full situation is explored below:

Business News

### Commercial Activities During a Week of Publication Suspension

Our newspaper has been suspended since the 9th, and it has been a week now. Around 4 a.m. on the 8th, the sounds of gunfire and cannons erupted, startling residents from their sleep. Around 10 a.m., Japanese troops entered the concessions in multiple directions, causing a considerable degree of panic at the time. Many businesses and banks that were already open were forced to close again. However, after the Japanese military issued a proclamation ensuring the security of the concessions and stating that private property of the general public would be absolutely respected with no other intentions, the panic gradually subsided. Recently, the Japanese military police commander also prohibited taking advantage of the public's anxiety to seek personal gain through unscrupulous means, threatening severe punishment. After this proclamation, it is hoped that the spirit of the rule of law will be followed, treating people of all nations with fairness and righteousness, which should further stabilize public sentiment. However, in the past week, the various scenes and rumors in the market seemed to warrant documentation despite the newspaper's suspension, so that readers would not feel a sense of interruption. Therefore, I have gathered some news and observations, though they may be belated, to provide some supplementary information.

Crowds Gathered in Front of Bank Counters

On the morning of the 10th, the Shanghai Municipal Council posted a notice stating that banks would soon reopen. Sure enough, at 9 a.m., various banks opened their doors one after another. However, at 10 a.m., another notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council announced a temporary closure. Starting from the 11th, banks would operate for three hours, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., with a limit of 500 yuan for each household's withdrawal. The frequency of withdrawals was to be determined by each bank based on its own financial situation, with some setting a limit of one withdrawal every three days, others one withdrawal per week, and some stipulating that if a withdrawal was not made in one week, it could not be combined with the next week's allowance. In reality, this was largely a superficial gesture. One bank adopted the third approach for general customers, imposing extremely strict restrictions. However, it was heard that it still secretly accommodated familiar acquaintances, allowing them to withdraw cash every three days. Some with skillful means even managed to withdraw 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in cash and leave. Generally, the counters of all banks were crowded with people. Observing the various banks, although the staff were busy with hardly a moment to rest, many were still able to handle matters calmly, providing patient guidance to customers whose procedures were incomplete, or whose deadlines had not yet arrived, or who had already withdrawn some funds but not the full amount, without becoming impatient. There were also those who habitually put on airs, easily taking out their frustrations on customers, displaying an arrogant and rude attitude that was both infuriating and laughable. The noise level during withdrawals made it difficult for people to hear, so some stood on the counter, shouting out numbers and paying based on tickets to avoid errors. Generally, there were fewer people using Western checks than Chinese checks at each counter. The number of savings account holders and current account holders varied, but at times, savings account holders were more numerous, as they mostly consisted of residents withdrawing cash for daily living expenses. Current account holders were mostly businesses, and the amount of 500 yuan was insufficient for business activities, so some did not even bother to withdraw. Fortunately, the banks were able to open as usual, providing some comfort amidst the panic. There were many rumors circulating in the market, suggesting that if only the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) would open its vaults and allow other banks to withdraw, the market could be restored. If this could not be done immediately, then for large transactions, only transfers should be allowed, while still permitting cash withdrawals within the limited amount, and relaxing the withdrawal methods, so as not to repeat the high discount rates and limited withdrawals seen after August 13th. Discounting only serves to exploit the interests of depositors and creates more opportunities for profiteering for the banking industry. The operating hours should not be further restricted, as placing both cash withdrawal and time restrictions seems to only consider the convenience of the banking industry while neglecting the convenience of the public. Furthermore, limiting the time adds a serious overtone that is also undesirable. Let's see if there will be improved measures in the near future.

Premium on Banknotes Becomes Prevalent

Since banks have limited cash withdrawals, there is a general need for cash to pay employees' salaries and other expenses. Therefore, it has become necessary to discount banknotes from shops. Currently, most banknotes are in the hands of grain merchants, sellers of northern and southern goods, soy sauce shops, distilleries, salted goods stores, oil factories, daily goods stores, and large companies. There is already an unofficial premium of 2% on banknotes, and even higher in some cases. However, recently, the premium has been smaller. Because banks have restricted cash withdrawals, even current account holders with cash dare not deposit it, regarding it as a rare commodity. Banks are disbursing more than they are receiving, making it difficult to cope. As a result, damaged and torn banknotes are being passed on to depositors, regardless of whether they are usable in the market or not. It is considered a great favor by the bank to still provide cash to depositors in the current situation, as long as the banknote is countable, regardless of whether it is usable in the market or whether the depositor suffers a loss. However, if one is familiar with the bank staff, one can directly enter the inner office, whispering and conferring. One is not subjected to crowding, nor does one have to wait long, and one receives intact banknotes. The various conveniences are too numerous to mention. The unequal treatment of bank customers is a sign of the bankruptcy of commercial ethics and the decline of service. In particular, the attitude of counter number 12 at a certain bank on Sima Road is the worst, with employees often making hurtful remarks. Almost everyone who has had contact with that counter agrees on this. However, this is still a matter of the bank's poor employee management. Considering the overall situation, any restriction often easily leads to the opposite effect. Therefore, restrictions should only be used for temporary emergencies. If the market is to return to normal, it is best not to have restrictions. This can reduce the congestion at bank withdrawals and allow some cash to return to bank vaults. However, restrictions can be placed on unnecessary spending and collateral that promotes speculation and hoarding, which is also a way to stabilize the market.

Various Markets Temporarily Stagnate

Since British and American banks such as HSBC suspended trading, the black market exchange rates ceased to exist. American dollars and Hong Kong dollars also came to a standstill due to the declaration of war by Japan against Britain and America. Those holding these currencies were in a state of panic, unable to dispose of them. There was no official market price, and rumors were rampant, leaving people at a loss. Gold shops initially maintained the exchange rates from the previous Saturday (December 6th), at 1,430 yuan per tael. Later, due to the lack of market activity, many small gold shops removed these price listings, while some still listed 1,500 yuan. Most of the overseas stocks belonged to British and American businesses. Due to these changes, the various trade associations suspended trading, so there were no market prices to speak of. In this state of tight credit, no Chinese merchant had the mood to buy or sell stocks. As a result, those who wanted to sell were forced to accept low prices. Many small pawnshops closed their doors because there was no speculation to be done. Speculative markets such as cotton yarn and raw silk were naturally among those that were suspended. These speculative transactions disrupt the market, shake commodity prices, and easily become a medium for manipulation and hoarding. In the current situation, it is fortunate that they have stopped. As for other various markets, there were only a few spot transactions. Most goods were sealed in warehouses. If the market is to revive, it is necessary to revive the financial system. There is no other solution.

Maintaining People's Food Supply Nears Starvation

Since the control of rice and grain, there has not been panic under the orderly process. However, purchasing has been inconvenient. Now, residents are greatly affected. In order to buy rice, they rise before dawn, inquiring everywhere about where it is sold. If it is available, they rush to wait in line regardless of the distance. They wait regardless of how long it takes, enduring rain and wind, ignoring hunger and cold, in order to obtain rice. Two liters of rice is hardly enough to feed a family, so they bring the old and the young, pushing and shoving, with their chests and backs pressed together, hoping to secure their portion. As a result, there are often thousands of people. For example, on December 12th, when the Xie Chang De rice shop at the intersection of Park Road sold rice, the people waiting to buy rice stretched westward from the shop door, then turned north, along Rue Mayet, near Shanhai Pass Road, resembling a long snake. Even at dusk, it was still so crowded. One can only imagine how many people there were that day. At a certain rice shop on Weihaiwei Road, before 8 a.m., people had already reached the middle section of New Dagu Road. The situation was the same in other places. If rice shops did not refuse to sell rice, there would always be a constant stream of people. Those who could not buy rice turned to buy flour. Once the flour was sold out, with nothing to eat, they rushed to buy cut noodles. Cut noodles were expensive, costing 1.5 yuan per catty, but people were still crowded. So, they put up the "closed" sign and traded from the square window. Some went to buy small breads to fill their stomachs, which usually sold for 0.25 yuan but were now selling for 0.35 yuan. The sweet potato market was too strong, and there was nowhere to buy them. Large pancakes were considered too expensive. Although corn flour cakes did not suit their taste, they were also selling very well. On the sidewalks, the cart pullers' rice vendors sold bowls of rice for 0.3 yuan, and those squatting to eat were no longer just cart pullers. In front of the rice shops, most of the signs said "Rice Sold Out." Because there were few places selling rice, and the number of people waiting to cook rice was large, living on porridge was not uncommon these days. It has only been a few days, and many still have rice in storage. However, the difficulty of buying rice is already like this. In the future, if the number of people waiting to buy rice increases, it will put the entire city's population at risk of starvation. The people's food supply is a major prerequisite for social order. It is heard that private rice and grain stored in warehouses are now allowed to be released, but only a few people benefit from this. Shouldn't we consider improving the current situation for public rice and grain to help the majority of people? The following should be done immediately: 
 * Immediately release 100,000 bags of rice stored in warehouses and distribute them to rice shops throughout the city for sale. 
 * Remove the 2-liter limit and change it to 5 liters per unit to reduce possible crowding, reduce the labor of rice shops, and facilitate residents' purchases. 
 * Residents should not be arbitrarily stopped and confiscated when carrying rice across the road. There have been cases where people borrowed rice from relatives and friends, only to have it intercepted on the way, claiming it was contraband. There was even a case where someone carrying something other than rice, thinking it was a cloth bag, was ordered to stop and forcibly searched. Only when they saw it was not rice did they leave angrily. There was also a case where someone brought rice to Shanghai from the mainland and a cyclist searched and took it away, causing them to sit on the ground and cry. It is unthinkable that carrying food rice is not comparable to theft, yet they are subjected to such harsh treatment. Although this comes from hearsay, those responsible for local security must be aware and must prohibit their subordinates from doing so, regardless of whether it is true or false. 
 * Now that foreign rice cannot come in, the rice stored in warehouses in the concessions should be completely placed under control. Negotiations should be held with the Japanese military to dredge up the source of rice in the interior, in order to provide for the food supply of the concession residents and seek the reality of living in peace and working happily. Not only should those transporting rice from outside the concession into the concession not be stopped, but they should also be given permits to facilitate circulation within the concession, increase the food supply, and strictly prohibit harassment. 
 * If rice shops are to be rotated for sale, the areas should be assigned and the rice shops should be rotated daily, so that residents do not have to travel east and west and still have the pain of not being able to buy rice. 
 * The French Concession authorities should use French ships to obtain rice from Annam and other places to provide for the food supply. (To be continued)

### Public Bonds Traded Last Week

Settled in Full, Reopening Still Undecided

Our newspaper has been suspended for a week since its publication on the 8th of this month. The public bond market also suspended trading from the 8th. However, the transactions made on the previous Saturday (the 6th), totaled about 500,000 yuan. The transactions on Monday and Tuesday of last week were not settled. Subsequently, due to the good market order, all industries returned to normal operation, and financial institutions gradually recovered. Therefore, the transactions made on the previous Saturday were fully settled by Wednesday because the banks issued payment orders and the industry followed suit. There were no problems with the long and short positions. Although the market did not officially open for business on Friday and Saturday, there was still some activity in off-market trading, mostly in Classes A and C. According to the writer's knowledge, over 200,000 yuan was traded successively by Lianyi and Lianhe. The transactions made by other firms are not included in this. The highest price for Class C was 64.9 yuan, and the lowest was 64.3 yuan. Class A traded at 70 yuan even. Class C was several jiao higher than the previous minimum price of 64 yuan. Public sentiment is still stable. However, the routine 12th draw for Class E was not held, or may have been temporarily postponed. It has not yet been decided when the public bond market will reopen as usual.

According to Yongchang Firm, stock transactions that have been completed can still be settled in full in the short term. There have been no unexpected events, nor have there been any urgent requests to sell.

### The Gold Market is Quiet

Due to the long-term lack of overseas arrivals of hardware and metals, the inventory is not very abundant. In the past, although daily sales to customers were scarce, the quantity of purchases was still not weak. However, since yesterday and today, sales from the Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao groups have been sluggish, and manufacturers in this street have no appetite at all, so the market has been quite quiet all day. Prices will also be difficult to rise. Yesterday, 200-pound tinplates sold for 1,400 yuan per box, and 200-pound ferrous sheets sold for 1,200 to 1,300 yuan per box (due to the different sizes of the boxes, the thickness and unevenness, and the number of sheets).

### Daylily Costs are High

Recently, daylilies have become more expensive due to the flat drop in Tianjin exchange rates, resulting in fewer sources. Although the Hong Kong group has suspended operations, the base accumulation is already small. However, inland groups such as Shenjiamen in Ningbo are still handling them, mostly taking mid-range goods. The most recent transaction was for Suqian vegetables, priced at 310 yuan.

### Talking About Lao Sheng (Old Male Roles)

— Shu Wu

Lao Sheng, also known as Xu Sheng (Bearded Male Roles), hold one of the most important roles in dramas. Therefore, the restrictions on everything about them are very strict. It doesn't matter if other characters sing a word or two "backwards", but if a Xu Sheng sings a word backwards, that's a major problem. Therefore, the rule for them is "correct pronunciation and round intonation". However, it is not easy to pronounce words correctly and sing intonation roundly. Like today's general Qing Yi (Virtuous Female Roles) and Hua Dan (Vivacious Female Roles), about three or four tenths of the words in each singing line are sung backwards, but they are still known as famous Dan (Female Role) actors. Xu Sheng, however, cannot do that, because everything about him must be particularly emphasized.

Pihuang (Peking Opera) was originally based on Xu Sheng, but due to a lack of talent, Dan roles gradually rose in prominence, and the position of Xu Sheng also declined. This may be because people who generally study drama think that Xu Sheng are easy to learn, resulting in careless work and a lack of outstanding talent. For example, the words of Xiaosheng (Young Male Roles) must be tightly bitten; the words of Qing Yi must be read accurately, but those who study Xu Sheng do not study this, thinking that the rules of Xiaosheng and Qing Yi are also the same, but they do not know that the words of Xu Sheng must be bitten even more tightly and accurately! As such, it is now too rare to find a Xu Sheng with all-round skills.

In addition to "correct pronunciation and round intonation," a Xu Sheng with all-round skills must also be "good at singing, acting, reciting, and fighting; proficient in literary, military, Kunqu, and miscellaneous styles!" When Lao Tan (Tan Xinpei, a famous Peking Opera actor) was alive, he was indeed worthy of the title. After Xinpei's death, commentators all said that "Shuyan (Tan Xiaopei's stage name) got his skills, and Youchen (Yu Shuyan's stage name) got his singing." In fact, Shuyan was more brilliant than Youchen. Only Shuyan can be considered a Xu Sheng with all-round skills. Except that his singing lacked some of the flavor of Lao Tan, he could rival Lao Tan in everything else. "Dingjun Mountain" and "Farewell Mother Amidst Flying Arrows" were all his famous plays. Whether reciting or biting words, he had put in a lot of hard work, such as the shocking white mouth in "Dingjun Mountain," the excellent demeanor in "Farewell Mother Amidst Flying Arrows," the clear and melodious voice in "Burning Cotton Mountain," and the complete voice and appearance in "White Mang Terrace." Moreover, although his voice was small and low, the audience sitting in the last row could hear it very clearly, which was clearer and more pleasant than those loud-voiced actors who just shouted blindly.

Next, we can talk about Gao Qingkui. This old man is known for his acting. Although some people like his loud voice, in fact, his singing, except for a thicker rhythm, is not very good. His martial arts can only cope, which is far worse than Tan Fuying. In particular, his eyes lack spirit and his mouth lacks strength. What is he good at? He can completely dramatize singing and acting. It is common to see some actors who do not care about anything when singing and completely abandon the emotions in the play, and then act after singing. This is the most undesirable thing. When Ma Lianliang sings a tragic original board, it is moving and exciting, which can make people forget the sorrow and forget that he is a dying person in the play; however, this breaks the atmosphere of the tragedy.

When we watch Gao Qingkui's "Crying at the Qin Court," we can make the audience forget that he is singing a play. When he sings a long section of counter-tune, we only see him crying. He sings "Empty City Stratagem" even better. That section of "Er Liu" (a type of Peking Opera aria) is like talking to Sima Yi, which is so natural and harmonious. This kind of performance is what is in line with drama.

### Amusing Facts about Clark Gable

— Wei Zeng

When Clark Gable was still a struggling extra, one night on his way home, he met a beautiful extra actress and offered her a ride home in his old car. In the car, he told her how wealthy his family was and that his acting was purely for entertainment. When they were about a mile from their destination, Clark suddenly changed his mind and casually said to her, "I'm turning here, goodbye!" So the girl had to walk home. After Clark turned the corner, he parked the car on the side of the road and walked home. Three days later, he borrowed money to buy gasoline and then retrieved the car. This girl was Janet Gaynor, and after that, she didn't pay much attention to him. Clark told people, "Maybe it was my pointless vanity, but I never had the chance to explain to her the reason for leaving her to go home alone!"

### Blood Rain and Exquisite Flowers

Chapter 19: Dusk, the Nomad Cavalry, Dust Filling the City

I think you are the most beloved person in Wu Sangui's heart. That kid is unwilling to surrender to me this time, and is bitterly opposing me because of you. He just wants to take you back from my hands, so that his wish can be fulfilled, so..." Li Zicheng said here, biting his upper and lower teeth, his face becoming even more terrible. Raising two fingers, he pointed to Yuanyuan and said, "I just won't let him get his wish, I'll harden my heart and chop you up, and see where that kid goes to find you!" Yuanyuan suddenly heard these words, and was shocked in her heart. Her jade face paled. She barely tried to calm herself and said, "Ah! Does the King really have the heart to kill this humble servant? This humble servant's life is as light as a feather, and death is nothing to regret. But doesn't the King think about himself?" Li Zicheng listened, and a look of doubt appeared on his face again. He asked Yuanyuan, "What do you mean by saying this?" Yuanyuan said, "This humble servant first heard that General Wu had received the King's letter of surrender, and was going to return with his armor rolled up. Only because of this humble servant, he started the war again. Now, if the King kills this humble servant, I am afraid that he will hate the King even more and will definitely seek revenge. Then what benefit is there for the King to kill a humble servant? I hope the King will think again." When Li Zicheng heard these words, he could not help but hesitate again, and the expression on his face gradually softened. He said to Yuanyuan again, "Then I won't kill you. I'll take you with me." When Yuanyuan heard this, she became anxious again. She thought to herself that if she were taken away by Li Chuang, it would be very dangerous again. Once she left, she did not know when she would return. She quickly said, "Now that this humble servant serves the King, how can I not want to follow the King? But I am afraid that General Wu will pursue endlessly because of this humble servant. Wherever the King goes, he will chase there. Please the King think again and then act. If the King's army can defeat General Wu, then this humble servant will ride in ceremonial attire to follow." Li Zicheng listened to Yuanyuan's words, and lowered his head to ponder endlessly. (239)
