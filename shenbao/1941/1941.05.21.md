### Large Shipment of American Military Supplies Arrives in Chongqing; China's Combat Strength Enhanced; US Adopts Armed Joint Defense Plan in the Pacific; Air Power Sufficient to Deter Japanese Ambition to Advance South

Manila. The news from Moscow and New York that Japan will not advance south has not aroused any interest here. American troops and aircraft continue to arrive, which makes the Filipinos firmly believe that Japan will never dare to infringe on the area under the American flag. Insiders believe that the US government's firm intention has been fully understood by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka. His attempts to probe for peace talks are mostly due to the fear of the flight of a large number of Flying Fortresses to Hawaii and the ease with which Consolidated Aircraft bombers can fly to Singapore. The opinions of American people here can be seen in the remarks of the "Bulletin," which is run by Americans. It said, "Japan's promise not to advance south is not as valuable today as it used to be. The United States has adopted a policy contrary to appeasement and has adopted armed joint defense in the Pacific, which can largely prevent the occurrence of war. But if war is inevitable, it will be enough to cope with it." (United Press dispatch on the 20th)

Chongqing. Brigadier General Clagett, Commander of the US Air Force in the Philippines, is scheduled to fly to Chengdu from Chongqing tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)

London. Reuters Far East correspondent, in reviewing the overall situation in the Far East, said that the main features in the overall situation in the Far East in the near future are the increase in British and American aid to China and the firm attitude toward Japan. Last week, when Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a farewell banquet for US Ambassador Johnson in Chongqing, he said in an impromptu speech, "If democratic countries help with military equipment and economy, Japan can be handed over to China without sending naval and land forces to China." Such views are also evident in London and Washington. After US economic expert Currie and Captain James Roosevelt, the eldest son of President Roosevelt, toured Chongqing, Brigadier General Clagett, Commander of the US Air Force in the Philippines, is now also going to Chongqing for a month-long inspection to study China's military needs. According to reliable sources, a considerable amount of supplies, including aircraft that China needs most urgently, have recently arrived in Chongqing from the United States via the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Although the highway has been bombed by Japanese aircraft many times, traffic continues uninterrupted. Foreign journalists who have recently traveled along this road have all firmly stated that this road will never be interrupted. Although the river bridge has been destroyed, the Chinese are resourceful and have built a temporary pontoon bridge, which is well hidden during the day and can be used without hindrance at night. A large number of workers are densely distributed along the way to fill the holes caused by bombs at any time.

### Grew and Matsuoka Hold Talks

Tokyo. Deputy spokesman Ishii of the Cabinet Intelligence Department announced today that the meeting between Foreign Minister Matsuoka and US Ambassador Grew yesterday was "only a social meeting." Ishii told foreign journalists at a routine press conference that Foreign Minister Matsuoka had invited Ambassador Grew to his private residence for tea, and Grew had also presented the Foreign Minister with excellent cold medicine. When someone asked Ishii whether Japan had the right to treat countries at war in the Sino-Japanese war, Ishii replied that this issue had been discussed many times, but the government's attitude toward this matter had not changed.

### British Economic Aid to China Stabilizes the Legal Tender and Has Achieved Results

Last week, British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons that he admired China's firm struggle against Japanese aggression and promised to help China as much as possible. It is said that those who heard it applauded endlessly. Although Britain is in urgent need of military supplies and cannot share them, the recent British loan of £50 million for China's currency stabilization fund has had a stabilizing effect on the exchange rate of legal tender. Another loan of £50 million for China to purchase supplies in the sterling bloc can also be beneficial to China. Eden also stated in his speech that he had clearly informed the Japanese government that if Japan does not earnestly respect its promise to respect British rights in China, then the Japanese side's accusations against Britain for imposing economic restrictions on Japan will not be considered by the British side. The extent to which the Japanese army controls trade in the occupied areas of China is almost incomprehensible to overseas people. The Japanese army blatantly uses the name of control to carry out plundering. No import or export can pass without its permission. Those who are allowed to engage in trade are not distinguished between people from Axis countries and non-Axis countries. Apart from the Japanese, even German and Italian merchants are subject to the same restrictions as other merchants.

### The Rumored Conditions for German-Soviet Compromise Greatly Alarm the Japanese Authorities

The fact that Britain and the United States are not moved by Japan's empty threats will definitely make the Japanese, who embrace realism and only value force and do not know appeasement, feel something. Now there are already various signs of a collective resentment trend in Tokyo. The Japanese-Soviet agreement concluded by Matsuoka is not welcomed by the navy and army. They believe that if the Soviet Union continues to transport military supplies to China, then this agreement is useless. At the same time, Japanese newspapers were greatly alarmed when they heard that Germany intended to exchange new concessions from the Soviet Union for conditions that would allow the Soviet Union a free hand in Asia. "Hochi Shimbun," which is most known for its leaning towards the Axis, said that Japan must consider and pay attention to its steps. Even if Germany wins in Europe, it may not necessarily lead to the realization of Japan's hopes in Asia. In summary, the most obvious thing is that if the Japanese army is bogged down in the protracted war in China for one day, then Japan will not be able to go further and launch another large-scale invasion plan for one day.

### US President Will Announce a National Emergency; Will Send a Special Message to Congress

Washington. Senator Barkley said that President Roosevelt will send a special message to Congress to announce a national emergency. It has not yet been decided, but others believe that the President may soon report the emergency situation to legislators. The news that the President will announce a state of emergency came from Republican Congressman Fish of New York, who said that he might challenge the President's placing the country in a state of undeclared war. (United Press dispatch on the 20th)

Washington. It was learned here yesterday from the highest authorities that President Roosevelt is considering submitting a special message to Congress on the international situation. He may even declare a full-scale emergency in the article. Roosevelt met with many legislative leaders yesterday morning, the first time in three weeks. Leaders learned that the President may send a special message to Congress to make a statement on the impact of the war on the United States, or even advocate taking new congressional actions. It is reported that if the President decides to send this message, it will be implemented in the near future. United Press reporters also learned that President Roosevelt was reading a document on his desk, but it is not known whether it was a conscription order or a special message to Congress. At the same time, the President also summoned eight squadrons of the National Guard Air Force, one battalion of infantry, and multiple battalions of coastal artillery to enlist in the army. (United Press dispatch on the 20th)

Washington. The general opinion is that full cooperation between Britain and the United States is not far away. This opinion is becoming more and more powerful because President Roosevelt has various signs of making a major decision. The President's fireside chat is scheduled for May 27, but Senator Barkley, a Democrat from Kent, pointed out after the White House meeting yesterday that the President may send a military message to Congress this week due to the urgency of the situation. Barkley said that this plan is still unclear and he does not want to discuss it. Knowledgeable people here assert that this step will inevitably involve the United States in the war. It is reported that there are very few people who oppose this new plan. The public believes that the government is now preparing the people for more severe actions by the US Navy. According to Secretary of State Hull and Secretary of the Interior Ickes, who issued statements over the weekend stating that the US must not shrink from providing effective assistance to Britain, the aforementioned confidence is based on the statements of Hull and Ickes. It is generally believed that this decision is not a declaration of war against Germany, because this development must be initiated by Congress, but Congress is not prepared to take this step.

### Penang and Wellesley Announced as National Defense Zones; British-Thai Relations Maintained Friendly; Japanese Rumors Not Worth Believing

Bangkok. The authorities of the Straits Settlements announced yesterday that Penang and Wellesley will be regarded as "national defense zones" and will implement the British National Defense Law. Foreigners who stay in the national defense zone for more than 24 hours must obtain a special permit from the British police authorities. (Haitong dispatch on the 20th)

Bangkok. According to news broadcast by the Tokyo wireless radio station, British commercial operations in Thailand, including tin mines run by agents, will be closed. The British Embassy here today firmly denied this. The Tokyo wireless radio station also broadcast news that the British authorities in Bangkok had protested to the Thai government because they heard that Thailand and the Soviet Union had concluded an agreement to exchange minerals and rubber produced in Thailand for Soviet oil. This statement has been officially denied by the Thai government. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)

Tokyo. "Kokumin Shimbun" said today that no matter what situation Japan encounters, the Japanese army is determined to continue to have powerful operations in order to overwhelm Chongqing's resistance as a shortcut to ending the "China Incident." The newspaper said that some signs indicate the difficulty of resolving the "China Incident," which has caused rumors from the outside world and distorted the recent remarks of Japanese Ambassador Honda stationed in Nanjing. (United Press dispatch on the 20th)

Tokyo. "Yomiuri Shimbun" announced today that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now considering sending separate ships to withdraw more than 50 Japanese residents from Iraq, Iran, Syria, and other places in the Near East for fear of the spread of war. However, the staff of the embassies and consulates stationed in the aforementioned countries will continue to serve and will not be withdrawn. (United Press dispatch on the 20th)

Editorial

### On the Attitude of the Soviet Union

Abstracting and summarizing the recent international expressions and omens, one cannot but be reminded that there are major changes in the international future brewing. Moreover, due to the severity and sharpness of the current situation, its complexity and ambiguity are even greater than in any previous period of brewing.

The most serious problem at present is the attitude of both the Soviet Union and Germany towards the Near East issue. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it is certainly the most important factor in the evolution of the future international situation. The Balkan issue is generally believed that it will never stand idly by, but it finally stood idly by, and the British-Greek-Yugoslav alliance finally failed. Regarding Turkey, it has always been believed that it will not tolerate the sharp advance of German and Italian forces, but the news of the past two days has made people who care about Turkey's future feel very uneasy. Another example is the Soviet Union's signing of an agreement with Japan, although not entirely unexpected, has also deepened the ambiguity of the future. From these arrangements and smoke screens, it is extremely elusive what kind of attitude the Soviet Union will take towards Germany and Italy extending into the Near East.

After thoroughly pondering, one cannot but question the motives behind the Soviet Union's various measures in the past six months? If we say that its only diplomatic principle is to avoid being involved in the vortex of war, then everyone with eyes can see that its long-standing actions have actually brought the war closer and closer to its own territory; and based on the fundamentals of its founding, it is by no means a believer in the principle of "peace at any cost." If we say that the application of its policies lies in fundamentally clarifying the boundary between the imperialist melee and the war for its own survival, then the nature of the South-Nazi resistance and the British-German war is obviously different. Even if we take a step back, the South-Nazi later became one with Britain, forcing the Soviet Union to reluctantly stand idly by, but when Greece was fighting Italy alone, Greece did not collude with Britain; at that time, the Soviet Union did not take any strong steps to prevent the expansion of the war, curb the flames of aggression, to protect small neighboring countries, and to protect its own security. If we say that all the Soviet Union's actions are aimed at breaking the possibility of a united imperialist offensive, this is exactly the bait that Germany and Italy have always used to lure Britain and France, which was endorsed by the Chamberlain faction, but now it has long passed, that is, there is absolutely no possibility of Britain and the United States suddenly joining hands to attack the Soviet Union. To go a step further: geographically, the only countries that originally had the possibility of encircling and attacking the Soviet Union were Germany, Italy, and Japan; and the only countries that coveted the resources of the Soviet Union were also Germany, Italy, and Japan; and certainly not Britain and the United States. Even if it is said that the Soviet Union cannot but be particularly wary of Britain and the United States, the Soviet Union will never seek offset from the aggressive group. If we say that the Soviet Union's only current goal is to disintegrate the British imperial structure and promote the liberation of small nations; but in fact, the Soviet Union has not particularly actively assisted the liberation movements of small nations; moreover, there is absolutely no reason to believe that Germany and Italy will become the saviors of India, Abyssinia, and other countries?

Looking back on the past, the reason why the forces of human justice were unable to unite or cooperate was that the past countries of Britain, France, and the United States were more responsible than the Soviet Union; but in the past six months, the Soviet Union's various measures have made the possibility of unity and cooperation even more distant. Of course, the decision at the time was easier to make mistakes than the review afterwards, and the decision-making errors were often unavoidable by any country. However, now can be said to be a critical moment, and being brave enough to repent and correct mistakes should be at this moment. Therefore, the emergence of individual or joint major actions by the three parties of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union can also be regarded as not impossible. If this is not the case and the situation unfortunately deteriorates further, then unless it is said that "the Soviet Union's goal is to prolong the evil struggle of all capitalist countries, and in the end, it will reap the benefits and launch a so-called world revolution," there is nothing else to explain it.

The right and wrong of the "world revolution" theory are of course not discussed here. What is worth pointing out is that: first, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan once tried their best to exaggerate this claim, trying to mobilize all imperialists to unite and form a crusade to attack the Soviet Union; and they also demanded the right to divide the world from countries such as Britain and France as the price under the conditions of acting as the vanguard. Second, since the outbreak of this European war, people with a relatively strong sense of justice in countries such as Britain, France, and the United States have completely overcome the obstacles of this faction in their countries and have proceeded to engage in a major war against Germany and Italy; they believe in the inevitability of world progress and oppose Germany and Italy turning back the clock. Taking the discussions on the ideal of postwar world reconstruction by all democratic countries since the beginning of the war, the so-called "new order" of the aggressor group, and the degree of tolerance of all democratic countries for freedom of thought and activity, and the destruction and persecution in the aggressor's country, as a general comparison, it is very obvious which side in the opposition is the Soviet Union's future possible companion. Suppose the Soviet Union uses its own actions and gestures to allow those who harbor ill will towards it to gain an excuse to prove the so-called "fisherman," the blow and misfortune suffered by each democratic country will naturally not need to be said. More importantly, the Soviet Union itself must then independently deal with this crisis, which is inevitable and unprecedented! As for the realization of the world revolution, we can only wait until the Soviet Union has dealt with the crisis before talking about it.

He said that since the scale of the Zhongtiao Mountain battle is so great, heavy casualties on both sides are inevitable. After two weeks of fierce fighting, the Japanese army has suffered thousands of casualties, and the current development of the situation is already in favor of us. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)

### Yunnan-Burma Railway Construction Plan: The British Government is Willing to Assist with Funding to Complete the Railway Soon

Lahore, India - The Lahore Military and Civilian Daily News reports that China, having built the 1,400-mile-long Chongqing-Kunming-Burma Highway in just over a year since commencing construction in December 1938, is now demonstrating its ability to build railways in addition to highways. The British government is willing to undertake the expense of laying railway tracks from Lashio to the Burmese border.

### US Congress Passes the Philippine Islands Export Control Act - This Act is Applicable to All US Territories

Washington - A new economic pressure from the United States against Japan, the Soviet Union, and other Axis-affiliated nations, allowing for restrictions on vegetable oils, fats, and hemp, has become possible yesterday. This is because Congress has passed the Philippine Islands Export Control Act and sent it to President Roosevelt for signing. This act also applies to all territories and possessions of the United States. Philippine coconut oil and coconut kernels are well-known raw materials for manufacturing glycerin, gunpowder, and many other essential military supplies. Hemp, a specialty of the Philippines, is the only and irreplaceable raw material for manufacturing ropes, which are essential for ships and many industrial uses. House Speaker Rayburn and Vice President Wallace have signed this resolution to apply the export control regulations to the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, and the Canal Zone, and sent it to the White House for President Roosevelt's approval. It took just ten days from when Secretary of War Stimson submitted the bill to Congress to its passage yesterday. When the bill was passed in the House, Representative Wolcott, the acting Republican leader, raised some questions. These questions indicated the opposition of isolationists to it. However, after explanations from other representatives that the War Department, the State Department, and the Philippines all supported the bill, Wolcott was satisfied and did not oppose it. Thus, the bill was passed like the Senate version and sent to the White House. It is expected that the White House will approve it soon. The Philippines' support seems to be most crucial in the final consideration of the bill, and the fact that the Philippines is willing to endure any sacrifice to support the common defense has clearly made a deep impression on members of Congress and officials who believe that Philippine leaders are inclined towards Japan and the Axis powers. (United Press, 20th)

Manila - The entire Philippines today unanimously supports President Roosevelt's program to restrict the export of essential raw materials from the islands to aid friendly nations and oppose unfriendly nations. The main Philippine exports, such as coconut kernels, coconut oil, hemp, and iron, will be subject to the export licensing system stipulated by the bill passed by the US Congress yesterday, placing US lands and territories under control procedures. Earlier, before Washington managed this matter, the Philippine Congress was also considering a similar procedure. Most Philippine representatives support the procedure, considering it not only a gesture of goodwill towards the United States but also a demonstration that the Philippines is clearly cooperating with the United States to aid democratic nations and resist totalitarian nations. Authoritative observers say that the passage of the bill by the US Congress to control Philippine exports fills a major loophole in the US export licensing system. Although the United States has banned the export of coconut kernels and coconut oil, these Philippine-produced oils have continued to be shipped to Japan, Shanghai, and Vladivostok in the past six months, and the quantities have increased. Informed sources say that most of these goods are shipped to Moscow and then transshipped to Germany. (United Press)

### Following the Surrender of Italian Troops in Abyssinia, the War May Soon End - Small Units of Italian Troops are Still Resisting Fiercely - The Fall of Diredawa Cuts off the Only Retreat Route

London - One of the biggest obstacles to the British army's operations in Abyssinia will be removed this afternoon, as the Italian flag on the Amba Alagi fortress will be lowered at that time to signify surrender to the British army. Duke Aosta, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, is scheduled to surrender this afternoon along with General Gazzera and staff officers, in accordance with the terms of surrender. The Cairo Gazette estimates that the British forces captured 7,000 enemy troops at Amba Alagi, along with many artillery pieces and countless war materials. Rome Radio last night acknowledged Aosta's decision to surrender. The station broadcast a telegram from Aosta to Mussolini, stating: "Since we cannot care for the many wounded soldiers and the battle situation is rapidly deteriorating, making prolonged resistance impossible even at the cost of significant losses, I believe it is appropriate to request an honorable surrender from the enemy. This request has been accepted by the enemy." With the fall of Amba Alagi and the surrender of the Italian commander-in-chief, the Italian resistance in Abyssinia is now limited to the Gondar region and the Gimma region (south of Addis Ababa). British forces are rapidly advancing in both of these regions. According to the Cairo Gazette, the Sudanese Defense Force operating in the Gondar region, with the assistance of patriotic Abyssinian forces, has occupied an important position in the Gondar region and severely damaged the Italian army. At the same time, British forces in the south have occupied the key road junction of Diredawa, capturing 800 enemy troops and seizing many artillery pieces and vehicles. The retreat route for two columns of Italian troops in the Gimma region has been cut off. (Reuters, 20th)

London - Before the surrender of Amba Alagi, Duke Aosta exchanged telegrams with Mussolini. According to a Rome Radio broadcast, Aosta's telegram explained the inevitability of surrender, stating, "I have certainly done everything that humanly possible could do. It is that which can be a solace at this painful time." Mussolini replied, "The Italian people admire your heroic battles with the troops, and are all convinced about the future with you." (Reuters, 20th)

Cairo - Military figures here claim that it is premature to assert that Duke Aosta's surrender will hasten the end of the Abyssinian war. It is now not able to make a judgement. Currently, two divisions of Italian troops each in the Gimma and Gondar regions, aided by the rains, may resist until the end of the rainy season. However, it is also possible that they will decide to surrender after receiving news of Aosta's surrender. The impact of the British forces' capture of Amba Alagi can be assessed in a few days. Military figures also stressed the importance of the British forces occupying the key road junction of Diredawa. It is said that the only retreat route for the two divisions of Italian troops concentrated in the Gimma and Lake regions has been cut off by the fall of Diredawa. Patriotic Abyssinian forces are lying in ambush in the jungle, waiting for an opportunity to strike hard. Therefore, the Italian army does not dare to retreat into the jungle. However, the area is as large as England. Unless the Italian troops in the area follow the example of their governor and abandon their weapons and surrender, it will still take some time for the British forces to defeat the enemy's resistance. Military figures also mentioned the German attack from the Gapsa Fort. The British Air Force has carried out large-scale dive bombings against the German army. The German army's two attempts to attack the "Hellfire" Pass were unsuccessful. The German army has not yet recovered from the losses suffered in the Solum region. (Reuters, 20th)

Rome - Yesterday, Italians here unanimously believed that the fall of Amba Alagi in Abyssinia was due to the British having more soldiers and military equipment than the Italians. The Italian army had neither aircraft nor anti-aircraft guns. They also solemnly stated that the Italian army even felt a lack of hand grenades before being besieged by the British. However, the Italian army resisted for 40 days. Until the last few days, the Italian commander, Count Aosta, only intended to restrain the British army. At the same time, news from Ethiopia stated that the native Ethiopian troops captured by the British army were forced into British tanks as guides for the British army. However, the native troops used hand grenades to destroy the tanks they were riding in and prevent the British army's advance, perishing with the vehicles. (United Press, 20th)

### Nazi Paratroopers Land on Crete - Some Paratroopers Reported Killed - Two Greek Divisions Have Arrived on the Island

London - Prime Minister Churchill announced that 1,500 German soldiers, dressed in New Zealand battle uniforms, landed separately on Crete today via gliders, parachutes, and troop transports. A military hospital between Chania and Maleme, the capital of Crete, was occupied briefly, but was quickly retaken. A considerable force of enemy troops on the Chania to Maleme road has not yet been cleared, but another team has been wiped out. By noon, the situation had been brought under control. The enemy attempted to occupy the Maleme airfield, but failed. (Reuters, 20th)

London - According to unconfirmed reports received here, an enemy paratrooper attack has been discovered on Crete. (Reuters, 20th)

London - According to responsible sources in London, Crete, the seat of the exiled Greek government, was attacked by a large number of paratroopers this morning. According to an official announcement from Cairo, some paratroopers have been killed. There are now British troops stationed in Crete, the number of which is unknown, serving as an obstacle to the Axis powers' advance into the eastern Mediterranean. All Allied troops stationed in Crete are commanded by Major General Freyberg, the former commander of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. Two full Greek divisions reportedly arrived in Crete on May 6th, with more to follow. Recently, there have been air raids on Maleme and Heraklion in Crete. Several German planes were destroyed while bombing the above cities. (Reuters, 20th)

London - The Free French News Agency in Cairo reported that British prisoners passing through Athens were cheered. The Germans have ordered that anyone participating in this activity will be executed, and accomplices will be sentenced to five years in prison. The German authorities in Greece are now requisitioning food and metals. The harvests of grapes and olives have been entirely seized. Vegetables are requisitioned daily and sent to Germany. Articles made of steel and zinc are also being requisitioned. Each housewife is only allowed to keep two cooking pots. It is rumored that Greek officers are now forbidden from appearing in Athens' main streets, as these streets are reserved exclusively for German soldiers. (Reuters, 20th)

### German-Italian Occupation of Sollum Confirmed

Berlin - An official communiqué has been issued confirming that the joint German-Italian forces in North Africa have occupied Sollum and the surrounding forts. (Havas, 20th)

### British Land and Air Forces in Iraq Occupy the Important Euphrates River Pass of Fallujah - An Important Route to Baghdad - Rumors that Iraqi Troops Have Invaded Transjordan

Bania - As a result of a joint British land and air force operation, the important bridgehead of Fallujah on the Euphrates River, connecting Habbaniyah and Baghdad, has been occupied. The bridgehead was held by some Iraqi troops, who retreated after being driven out of the highlands overlooking the Habbaniyah airfield by British forces. A large area between Habbaniyah and Fallujah was flooded by Iraqi forces, but the British flanking strategy was quite successful. At the same time, British troops transported by aircraft landed in the desert east of Fallujah and set up positions on three sides. The British had previously distributed leaflets warning residents that an attack was inevitable if the garrison did not withdraw. After receiving no response, they began the attack. The capture of this important bridgehead has opened the route to Baghdad. The Iraqi resistance was initially insignificant. The heavy bombing before the British land attack made this battle a great success. When the British army attacked, a German Messerschmitt fighter appeared at high altitude but withdrew after being attacked by the Central Air Force. (Reuters, 20th)

London - According to Axis sources, Iraqi troops have invaded Transjordan, but this has not been confirmed in London. (Reuters, 20th)

London - An official announcement today stated that the British Army, assisted by a Royal Air Force squadron, launched a large-scale joint land and air offensive in Iraq on Monday morning and broke through the Iraqi defenses and entered Fallujah at 2 PM on Monday. (United Press, 20th)

Beirut - The Iraqi High Command claimed that Iraqi troops and Arab tribal forces have repelled a British tank detachment in western Iraq. On the southern front, in the Basra region, Iraqi forces attacked the British camps at Maqil and al-Arjiba, inflicting "heavy losses on the enemy." Low-flying Iraqi aircraft also destroyed several British tanks in the desert. On Sunday, British aircraft flew over Baghdad and bombed the Rasheed airfield on the outskirts, but the "losses were minimal." (International News Service, 20th)

### British Aircraft Bomb Syrian Airfields

Beirut - According to reports here yesterday, British aircraft bombed the Palmyra airfield in Syria. British warships and Iraqi artillery exchanged fire near Basra. British aircraft also dropped leaflets in Aleppo and Damascus. (United Press, 20th)

Cairo - The challenge of General Dentz, the French High Commissioner in Syria, was accepted by the British yesterday. Although Dentz warned the British that the French land and air forces under his command would "meet force with force," the British still sent aircraft to bomb Syrian airfields. A public announcement stated that several German aircraft parked on the field were crushed and burned when British aircraft attacked the airfields of Palmyra, Damascus, and Rayak. Iraqi war reports stated that several places caught fire and were heavily damaged at the Ghailani airfield on the outskirts of Baghdad. (German radio claimed yesterday that French aircraft flew high to "defend" Syrian airfields, "and British aircraft turned and fled whenever they encountered French aircraft.") After General Dentz urged Syrians to "resist the criminal British aggression," British and American expatriates in Syria, advised by the British and American consuls, began to evacuate. (Reports from Ankara stated that diplomatic circles in Ankara were concerned that Britain and France would soon go to war in the Near East. The British Ambassador in Ankara warned Turkey in advance about the possibility of allowing Axis military supplies to transit Turkey through Syria to Iraq, which Britain was determined to oppose.) The Free French in London claimed that General Dentz had assisted German and Italian committees by transporting several of the latest French aircraft and mechanized units from Syria to Iraq. (International News Service, 20th)

New York - According to a broadcast from Berlin Radio, French and British aircraft clashed in the skies over Syria yesterday, and French aircraft shot down the first British bomber. (International News Service, 20th)

### Turkish-Syrian Railway Traffic Interrupted - Turkey Welcomes Dentz's Speech

Istanbul - Railway traffic between Turkey and Syria has been interrupted. The Turkish-Syrian border was sealed off on the 16th. (TASS, 19th)

Beirut - General Dentz, the French High Commissioner in Syria, delivered a speech here on the 18th, stating that the military development of Syria was a result of the armistice agreement. France had no intention of attacking Britain, but would resist any attack. Syria and Lebanon were closely united with France, and he had received orders to defend Syria and Lebanon, which he would strictly carry out. (Haitong, 20th)

Istanbul - After the speech delivered by General Dentz, the French High Commissioner in Syria, yesterday, the tense situation in Turkey has eased. Responsible figures here recently stated that Turkey has always wanted to maintain friendly relations with Syria. Judging from General Dentz's speech, it can be seen that Turkey's objective attitude is quite proper. (Havas, 19th)

### De Gaulle's Solemn Declaration Against the Franco-German Agreement - Usurpers of Power Do Not Hesitate to Kowtow to the Enemy - French People Will Never Recognize Treaties of Cession

London - General de Gaulle recently submitted a declaration to the British government and the leaders of the Allied governments in London, expressing complete opposition to the "agreements" signed by the Vichy government and the Germans. The declaration stated that the Vichy "government" has reduced itself to a state of being deprived of independence by the invaders. The Vichy government is entirely dominated by an old man, and this old man's senility has been known for many years. Rulers who usurp power and kowtow to the enemy, France cannot be responsible for their actions taken in the name of France. The French nation is currently continuing to fight with all the troops and areas outside the enemy-occupied territories. Therefore, all countries should regard France as a belligerent and the countries fighting the common enemy should regard France as an ally. (Reuters, 20th)

### Franco-German Negotiations Show Satisfactory Progress - Darlan to Visit Paris - 100,000 Prisoners of War to Be Released

Vichy - It is announced here that Admiral Darlan, Deputy Premier of France, is scheduled to depart for Paris today. (Haitong, 22nd)

London - German news agency says the Vichy government announced that Franco-German negotiations continue to make "satisfactory progress." All French officials and industrial and agricultural owners who need to go to the occupied areas in the northwest for administrative and economic reasons will be allowed to go by the Germans. The plan to repatriate some prisoners of war is under consideration. (Reuters, 20th)

London - A Reuters commentator stated that the Vichy government issued a public announcement yesterday stating that 100,000 French prisoners of war will be released and that Franco-German negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily. It is said that there are no less than 1.8 million French prisoners in German hands. Only 100,000 are being released now, the number is not very large. Thus, in terms of numbers, this is equivalent to giving a hungry person a spoonful of soup. The announcement also stated that a systematic plan to repatriate certain types of prisoners of war is currently under study. In plain language, the Vichy government is now telling the public that everything the government does in its plans for domestic and foreign cooperation with Germany is in return for the repatriation of prisoners of war. Therefore, protests against Franco-German cooperation are directly turned away from the returning countrymen. The average Frenchman is now in a state of helpless laughter. The "Paris Times," representing French heavy industry, is now commenting on the recent developments in Franco-German relations with trust and approval. However, in Britain, there is great dissatisfaction with France, and the broadcast by Syrian Governor Dentz is even more infuriating. London newspapers are ashamed of France. The "Evening Standard" stated that Dentz listened to the German enemy seize Syria, and instead threatened Britain with force. Future Frenchmen will blush when reading this outrageous speech. There have never been more absurd remarks made by a puppet figure than this one. The French people do not approve of this loss, but what Vichy needs to know is that if Vichy transfers its national wealth, resources, and the products of its armaments factories to the enemy, Britain and the United States will not be able to excuse it and must take severe action to deal with this form of cooperation. (Reuters, 20th)

### Dakar Issue Under Discussion by Both Sides

London - Today, while the public's attention is focused on Germany's actions in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey, British diplomats said they had received news that French Deputy Premier Darlan and German Ambassador to Paris Abetz had already discussed the future of Dakar and Casablanca, important locations in West Africa. These said emphatically that Germany's greatest attention, not for Gibraltar, to for Dakar. These were also aware that Hitler's envoys were currently attempting to enlist Spain and France to cooperate with it in order to resist the United States in West Africa. (United Press, 20th)

### Spanish Cabinet Completely Reorganized - Falangist Party Takes Over

Madrid - Former Spanish Republican Minister of War General Asensio said that the cabinet changes announced today mean that the time when Germany rules Spain is approaching. He said, "I am not surprised by this sudden change. I believe this is the Falangist Party's seizure of the government, and Germany's control of Spain has further progressed. This change is a step forward for the Nazi position in Spain." Franco has appointed the following new cabinet members: Treasury Secretary Brin, Agriculture Minister Rivera, Labor Minister Quilon, and Secretary of State and Falangist Party Secretary-General Diaz. (United Press, 20th)

Washington - Marquis of Aquiar, the chief representative of the Spanish Catholic Royalist Party, said that he had reported to the US State Department that all Spanish consulates in the United States actually represent Germany, and that the Nazi Party of Germany, using the name of the Spanish Falangist Party, is extending its reach everywhere, secretly under the command of Berlin. Several ships of arms have already been shipped to Mexico and Chile. Since last November, two German mechanized divisions have passed through Spain to French Tunisia and Italian Libya, waiting for an opportunity to take action against Morocco. This opportunity will come when General Franco agrees to cooperate with Germany. (United Press, 20th)

London - According to non-British envoys from Madrid, the threat of German aggression against Spain has diminished, and most of the German troops stationed on the Franco-Spanish border have been transferred elsewhere. The Spanish ambassador to Germany, who is currently in Madrid, will be recalled because the ambassador opposes Foreign Minister Serrano Suner's completely pro-German policy. Spanish leader Franco carried out a purge of the Falangist Party and major government departments today, causing various speculations here that a restoration may occur in Spain. It has been learned that the Duke of Alba has been appointed as the Chairman of the House of Lords and is working hard to restore the monarchy. It is believed that the majority of British government leaders will support this action. (United Press, 20th)

Madrid - It was officially announced that an agreement had been reached between Spain and the Vatican to resolve various county cases. This agreement does not qualify as a treaty. Its main point is about the Holy See's appointment of western frontier bishops. (United Press, 20th)

### Egyptian Transport Ship Sunk in the South Atlantic; Over a Hundred American Passengers Rescued; American Newspapers Condemn Nazi Pirate Behavior

German sources state that these crew members and passengers are currently residing in a certain location within the occupied territories. They also stated that the ship was sunk in accordance with international blockade regulations due to the contraband it was carrying. (United Press, 20th)

New York: The New York Times, in discussing the sinking of the Egyptian ship "Sansom" carrying American relief personnel to the Middle East, strongly condemned Germany's acts of piracy on the high seas. The newspaper commented, "Nazi pirates plunder everywhere and respect no flag." The US government repeatedly protested the cruel and indiscriminate violation of universally recognized principles of international law during the last Great War. The current German government has neither learned from the experiences of Admiral Tirpitz nor is willing to do so. (United Press, 27th)

### US Congressman Suggests Accepting French Islands in the Western Hemisphere; Washington Pays Close Attention to French Cooperation with Germany; French Ships Under Surveillance, Vichy Protests

Washington: Republican Congressman Case yesterday proposed in the House of Representatives that the United States should accept all French territories and properties in the Western Hemisphere. He stated that Congress should instruct the State Department to negotiate with France for the acquisition of Martinique, Guadeloupe (both in the West Indies), Saint Pierre and Miquelon (both south of Newfoundland), Guiana (north of Brazil), and French ships in American ports. The price could be paid from the $200 million stabilization fund. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday while receiving reporters that the United States has not conducted any discussions with other American nations regarding the occupation of French territories in the Western Hemisphere. While the United States is very concerned about Vichy's cooperation with Germany, it does not forget the need for food and other supplies on Martinique. (Reuters, 20th)

Vichy: According to semi-official sources here, the Vichy government has instructed its ambassador to Washington, Mr. Haye, to protest to the US government regarding the placement of armed guards on French ships moored in American ports. A total of ten French ships in American ports have been stationed with armed personnel, including the large passenger ship "Normandie," currently docked in New York Harbor. (Reuters, 20th)

### One-Third of French Merchant Ships Lost

Vichy: Officials recently announced that French merchant ships totaled 2,483,940 tons when the Franco-German armistice was signed in June last year, but currently, only 1,516,746 tons remain, a loss of one-third. Of these, 190 ships, totaling 450,000 tons, were intercepted by the British; 42,900 tons were intercepted by de Gaulle's forces; 57,000 tons were sunk; and the remaining 417,294 tons are blockaded in foreign ports. (Havas, 19th)

### Soviet Defense Paratroopers Conduct Exercises

Moscow: The Soviet Union, which pioneered paratrooper tactics, is now imitating British defenses by training civilians to defend against modern paratrooper warfare. Soviet radio broadcast yesterday that a counter-paratrooper exercise was held in the important industrial center of Stanilino, with a large number of civilians participating, including 13,000 miners. During the exercise, paratroopers attempted to seize the mine, radio station, and metallurgical plant, but were unsuccessful. Stanilino is located in the Donets Basin region of Ukraine, north of the Black Sea, and is rich in coal, iron, and manganese ore, with a population of 300,000. (Reuters, 20th)

### Over Three Hundred German and Italian Sailors Arrested in the US

Washington: The Department of Justice stated yesterday that nearly 300 nationals of Allied countries have been arrested in the US over the past weekend, mostly sailors, and primarily German and Italian sailors.

### Random Notes on the European War (57): A Scene from the Mediterranean War

The British and Italian navies engaged in a decisive battle in the Mediterranean on March 28th of this year. Regarding the battle, the American Christian Science Monitor published a radiogram from its special correspondent aboard the British Mediterranean Fleet flagship HMS Warspite. Here is the translation:

The British Mediterranean Fleet has long sought a decisive battle with the Italian fleet, but has had no opportunity. Until March 27th of this year, when British intelligence detected that the Italian fleet had departed from Cape Passero in southern Italy, divided into two groups, one in the south, including one battleship, and one in the north, including two battleships, each with multiple cruisers and destroyers. The British fleet immediately set sail from Alexandria on the decisive day, prepared to attack, while dispatching naval aircraft to search for the enemy.

That day, the flagship of the Italian southern fleet, the Littorio (35,000 tons, recently launched), was heavily damaged by an aerial torpedo launched by a British aircraft, reducing its maximum speed from 32 knots to 15 knots. Several other cruisers and destroyers were also hit by British bombers.

In the evening, the British fleet made formal contact with this Italian fleet in the waters west of Crete, Greece. At that time, the British flagship Warspite, Valiant, and Barham simultaneously opened fire with 15-inch guns, hitting and damaging the Italian cruisers Pola, Zara, and Fiume. British destroyers then launched torpedoes, sinking them one by one. At this point, the Italian fleet was in disarray, and another cruiser was hit by a shell and went missing. Several other destroyers were also heavily damaged and are presumed to have sunk.

After the battle, the British Admiralty announced that no British ships were sunk and no sailors were killed or injured. The Italian Navy Department acknowledged that the British Navy sank three cruisers, but claimed that one British cruiser was also sunk.

The detailed circumstances of the battle are described below:

On the upper deck of the British flagship HMS Warspite, a small number of officers were filled with tension. This tension was not the kind that could be felt on an ordinary night, but rather the excitement of the moment before battle.

It was not yet nine o'clock. They were talking to Admiral Cunningham, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, without even smoking. The entire fleet was shrouded in darkness. Admiral Cunningham was dignified, solemn, and unhurried, issuing only brief orders.

Everyone was fully aware of the current situation. British submarines had detected the Italian fleet on the 27th, sailing east from Cape Passero, northeast of Sicily. The British Mediterranean Fleet immediately departed from Alexandria and sailed to Suda Bay on Crete to lie in wait.

On the morning of the 28th, the cruiser HMS Orion detected that the enemy fleet had divided into north and south groups and was advancing through the waves. By evening, the main force of the British fleet was following the flagship HMS Warspite, sailing into the Ionian Sea, close to the predetermined battlefield. Several Greek fast warships also participated.

Italian destroyer in the situation of bomb rupture British Mediterranean Fleet The cause is Kerr Han

As night fell, the British fleet knew that it was now close to the enemy's southern group. The great battle that they had been longing for for months was about to begin in an instant.

The main force of the British fleet, HMS Warspite, the sister ship HMS Valiant (30,600 tons each, armed with 15-inch guns), and HMS Barham (35,100 tons, armed with 15-inch guns), advanced cautiously, with the destroyer fleet protecting them on both sides. Sailors were at their posts, searchlight operators were crouching behind the searchlights, signalmen were ready with their small lanterns, the cannons were ready to fire, auxiliary guns were loaded with illuminating shells, and the commanders were straining their eyes, searching for their targets.

Just after the nine o'clock bell, a dark shadow was glimpsed, but it was difficult to tell what it was. Perhaps it was the flagship of the enemy's southern group, the Vittorio Veneto (35,000 tons, armed with 15-inch guns). Admiral Cunningham gave the order.

By ten o'clock, the fleet was in formation. Twenty minutes later, a dark fleet appeared on the right, and at the same time, an enemy ship challenged from the left. Cunningham decided to abandon the isolated ship on the left and engage the enemy's main force, ordering the entire fleet to turn ninety degrees to the right.

As a result, the two fleets faced each other in a state of high alert. The enemy ships were so close that there was no need to fire illuminating shells.

The British destroyer HMS Greyhound quickly projected a beam of light into the enemy line, illuminating the third cruiser in the enemy line, the HMS Fiume. HMS Warspite saw clearly and suddenly opened fire with a broadside. The shells landed, and flames erupted at both ends of the enemy ship, and the rear observation tower collapsed and fell into the sea. HMS Warspite followed up with another broadside, and the Fiume caught fire and was crippled.

Having succeeded with the Fiume, Admiral Cunningham ordered the guns to be shifted to the second ship in the enemy line, the sister ship of the Fiume, the Zara. That ship was also hit and caught fire. The British ships then attacked their sister ship, the Pola. At one point, the Zara and Pola both hung white flags on both sides, requesting a truce. The enemy destroyers Corazzini and Maestrale then released smoke screens in an attempt to escape, but were also beaten to a pulp by the Barham.

At this moment, British searchlights discovered two other enemy destroyers, taking advantage of their superior position to launch torpedoes at the British ships. The British ships were not prepared, but fortunately, these torpedoes missed the British ships. Cunningham did not want the main force to be damaged, so he ordered the main ships to let the destroyers finish off the wounded enemy ships.

There were at least two squadrons of British destroyers, each with eight ships, each carrying about eight torpedoes, firing together, turning the sea into a world of torpedoes.

The naval battle ended at midnight. The Italian ships suffered heavy damage, and the northern group never entered the battle. Later, eight British reconnaissance planes flew over the battlefield and saw hundreds of Italian sailors sitting in lifeboats, fleeing in panic.

### Prominent Chinese and American Leaders and Merchants in Shanghai to Hold Grand Banquet This Afternoon; US Trade Policy is Reciprocal and Equitable; Relations Between the Two Great Nations Will Become Increasingly Harmonious; Western Newspapers Comment on the Great Significance of Sino-American Trade Week

The main formal social banquet to celebrate the seventh annual Sino-American Trade Week, sponsored by the American community in Shanghai, is scheduled to take place today (the 21st) at noon. Prominent Chinese and American leaders and merchants in Shanghai will gather at the American Club for the customary Sino-American Trade Luncheon. Mr. Nichols, Acting President of the American Chamber of Commerce, American Commercial Counselor Mr. Jared, and many other guests will deliver speeches. In addition to members of the Chamber of Commerce, there will be a total of fifty special guests attending. American Merchant Marine Day is on Thursday. The American Chamber of Commerce will host a banquet at the American Club on that day to celebrate. Furthermore, a banquet to entertain Chinese students who continue to study in the United States will be held at noon on Friday at the American Club to foster camaraderie.

### Special Significance of Trade Policy

The Continental Daily News editorial yesterday, titled "Business as Usual," stated that the annual celebration of Overseas Trade Week in the United States is of special significance to the American people and the people of all countries that have commercial relations with the United States. "This significance lies largely in the vast difference in the concepts of domestic and foreign policies between democratic and dictatorial countries. The three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan seek to increase their strength and wealth through conquest and enslavement of others. The consistent policy already announced by the US government is to use trade as a tool for international engagement."

### Reciprocal and Equitable Benefits to Promote Friendship

"Even as global conflicts rage on three continents today, the United States, both the government and its people, continues to follow the path established many years ago, aimed at increasing trade between nations in order to achieve reciprocal and equitable benefits, and to promote friendly relations through peaceful commercial engagement."

### Over 1,500 Participating Organizations

"The success of Overseas Trade Week in the United States can be evidenced by the dramatic increase in the number of organizations participating in this week. In 1935, only 300 organizations participated in this activity; the following year, it increased to over 600; in 1937, over 1,000; in 1938, over 1,200; in 1939, over 1,500. Within the designated celebration week, there must be Merchant Marine Day on May 22, which is a holiday designated by the American Chamber of Commerce to commemorate the first American steamship, the Savannah, which sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in May 1819, setting sail from Savannah."

### Sino-American Commerce Increasingly Important

"Recent trends in trade between China and the United States clearly demonstrate the importance of their commercial relationship. Although the situation is currently abnormal due to the Sino-Japanese War and the European turmoil, Sino-American trade continues to increase. Figures released by the US Department of Commerce reveal that in the first ten months of 1940, US imports from China increased by 60% compared to the previous year. During the same period, US exports to China were valued at US$62,908,000, compared to US$40,170,000 in the same period of the previous year."

### Shanghai Achieves Prominent Position

"As for Shanghai, according to figures compiled by financial and commercial magazines, in 1940, Shanghai accounted for 21.30% of China's imports to the United States (compared to 15.94% in the previous year), and 28.63% of China's exports to the United States (compared to 21.92% in the previous year)."

### US Exports to Japan Sharply Reduced

"Conversely, US trade with Japan has been forced to decline. In the first ten months of 1940, due to the European war, Japan increased its demand for US goods. However, after the implementation of export licensing controls on certain products, US exports to Japan sharply declined, and the gains made in the first ten months of that year were eliminated."

### Looking Forward to Increasingly Harmonious Relations

"Given the current international situation, these factors will become increasingly important. International trade relies heavily on goodwill and engagement among the various peoples involved. In this regard, the situation is particularly favorable for the continuation and increasing harmony of trade relations between China and the United States. Shanghai's celebration of Trade Week will further enhance the already existing harmonious and mutually beneficial relationship between commercial representatives of the two great nations. All those in a position to do so should do everything in their power to ensure that the special program celebrating Sino-American Trade Week is a complete success, so as to focus greater attention on China's trade relations with the United States."

### Zhengyan Daily Resumes Publication Today

The Zhengyan Daily, located at 289 Jiujiang Road and published by the Chinese-owned Lianbang Publishing Company, previously received a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council to temporarily suspend publication for two weeks starting from May 7. Having reached the end of that period, it will resume publication today. To commemorate the resumption, the newspaper has specially compiled and printed a "Zhengyan Daily Resumption Commemorative Special Edition," which includes sections on forums, special features, news summaries, recent maps of the Sino-Japanese War, news photographs, public discussions, literature, and more, and will be distributed free of charge to readers.

### Overseas Countries Widely Establish National Products Exhibition Halls

After the China Manufacturers Association, the China National Products Industrial Society, and the Production and Construction Association jointly requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to widely establish national products exhibition halls in overseas locations to increase the attention of foreigners and overseas Chinese to national products, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has now replied approving the suggestion and has instructed that the Hong Kong China National Products Exhibition Hall be established first. The location has been selected at 8 Queen's Road Central, and active preparations are underway to solicit exhibits.

### Post Office Resumes Acceptance of Insured Boxes to Switzerland

Post Office Announcement: The Post Office will temporarily resume accepting insured boxes destined for Switzerland, effective immediately. Delivery will be via Siberia, with insurance coverage within China extending to Shanhaiguan. The insurance limit for each item is 1,500 Swiss francs.

### Japan's Advocacy of Peace Proposals Seeks a Chance to Catch Breath; China Feels There is No Room for Consideration

The English-language Da Mei Evening Post commented yesterday on the peace atmosphere being spread abroad, saying that aggressors are seeking opportunities to catch their breath and have recently been talking about peace. Newspapers in France, which are controlled by the Germans, believe that both sides in the European War are evenly matched and cannot claim victory, so they are asking President Roosevelt or the Pope to mediate the European War. At the same time, on the other side of the world, we hear that Tokyo wants to end the Sino-Japanese War, but it is very difficult to predict what kind of conditions it will propose and what attitude the United States will take in mediating. The intention of Tokyo is probably to ask the United States to mediate under the following conditions: (1) the Japanese army will withdraw from the interior of China; (2) the United States recognizes Japan's superior position in China; (3) Japan stops its southward advance; (4) Japan obtains various economic privileges and promises to attach importance to the southern part of Asia, and the United States will help with loans. At the same time, Tokyo's two major pro-Axis newspapers, such as the "Hochi Shimbun" and the "Kokumin Shimbun," advocate that Japan should prioritize its own interests and must not participate in the Axis war vortex, regardless of any actions by the United States.

### China Cannot Accept It

China is a democratic country and must strive forward together with other truly democratic countries. Therefore, today, the Chinese people must clearly recognize that the above-mentioned solution to the Sino-Japanese War can cause China to suffer the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction. This proposal by the Japanese side, and the remarks of Hochi Shimbun and Kokumin Shimbun, are actually Japan's appeasement policy, and its future will suffer the same fate as the appeasement policies implemented elsewhere.

### This Proposal Has Other Ambitions

We all know that what Japan seeks is victory, not peace. Therefore, any work to negotiate peace with Japan that can fulfill Japan's desires is not true peace, but actually Japan's victory, giving it a chance to catch its breath. The democratic countries have all seen the results of the appeasement policy in Europe and Asia, that is, it did not bring peace, and it can be asserted that it will never come with peace. The only way to obtain true peace is definitely not from aggressors, and the current peace proposal is actually another manifestation of the aggressor's ambitions.

### Hong Kong Rice Sufficient to Meet the Needs of the Entire City; Can Be Purchased Without Restriction; Police Stations Have Prepared Sample Rice Bags; Circular Orders Patrol Officers to Compare and Inspect at Any Time

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued another notice yesterday regarding the sale of Hong Kong rice, stating that the Council believes that the Hong Kong rice currently available and that can be shipped in succession is sufficient to meet all the needs of the city. The temporary restrictions on the sale of rice stipulated in Notice No. 5457 should be lifted immediately. From now on, residents of the city may freely purchase this rice at any time for their own use. However, when this rice is sold to any buyer, if the quantity is one bag or more, the rice shop should issue an invoice stating the selling price, quantity, and the buyer's name and address. Each rice shop should also submit a copy of the invoice to the nearest police station for verification no later than the decisive day after the sale. It is hoped that citizens and rice shops can cooperate with the Council to avoid hoarding. It is rumored that the Council now requires all rice shops within the Settlement to sell Hong Kong rice.

Rumors of Rice Weevils Not Worth Paying Attention To

Yesterday, the rice weevils used the excuse of a Ningbo gang buying rice to increase the price of rice by several dollars again. A Datong reporter learned from the Zhejiang leaders in Shanghai yesterday that the so-called Ningbo gang is just a few people who came with 200,000 in cash, preparing to buy more than 1,000 bags of rice. Since the Ningbo retreat from the Four Banks to Longyou, 40 million in roving capital has followed the banks into the interior, so the rice shops with more specifications have insufficient capital turnover and are all insufficient to come. With the abundant rice reserves in Shanghai, the Ningbo gang's purchase of more than a thousand bags is like a drop in the ocean, what impact does it have on the entire rice market in Shanghai? It is actually borrowing the topic to play up, a donkey's trick, not worth laughing at. Therefore, yesterday the rice prices of various shops in the city dropped by four or five dollars.

Each Police Station Will Distribute Rice Samples

According to well-informed sources, the Municipal Council's fair-price Hong Kong rice strictly prohibits retail rice shops from mixing other kinds of rice. It has now started to make hundreds of small bags of Hong Kong rice samples and distribute them to patrol officers in each police station to keep with them so that they can check at any time when the retail rice shops sell them to see if they match the original sample. It is said that these hundreds of bags of rice samples should be all made today and can be distributed to patrol officers immediately. If residents of this city find any rice shops mixing etc., they should also immediately report to the Municipal Council or Jardine Matheson and Ewo, and severely investigate and deal with them. Also, yesterday's Saigon No. 1 was priced at 112 yuan per stone, while the rice shops still sold it at 120 yuan. Attention should be paid to this phenomenon.

### The Commercial Press Implements Layoffs; Mediation Difficult

The Commercial Press's layoff plan has been officially implemented. Yesterday, many people in the museum received dismissal letters and registered with the co-workers' association. The situation is panicked. The labor side has tried to find food personnel for the funding side, but they have not met. The labor side went to the Municipal Council again to petition, but there was no way to do it. Now, the co-workers' association is continuing to negotiate with a positive method, and on the one hand, it is registering all the co-workers who have been cut off and transferred. The cultural circles of Shanghai are hoping that the labor-management dispute in the museum will be resolved as soon as possible, and they are hoping that the transferers will make a final effort.

### Reduce Car Horn Noise; Prohibition Law Promulgated Yesterday; Extra Attention Should Be Paid When Driving Through Residential Areas

Yesterday was the second day of the "Reduce Car Horn Noise Campaign." In addition to ordering all patrol officers in the city to work hard to investigate cars that honk their horns excessively on the streets and give them advice and corrections, the Traffic Office added staff yesterday to distribute leaflets to cars driving on the streets and appealed to all theaters in the city to assist in expanding publicity. Under the guidance of the authorities, more than 20,000 car owners and drivers in the city have gained a deep impression of the significance of this movement, so the noisy atmosphere that filled the city in the past has gradually been eliminated.

### Prohibition Law

In order to effectively implement the ban on cars randomly honking their horns to avoid disturbing the quiet air, the Traffic Office of the Municipal Council has promulgated the following regulations: "(1) Extra attention should be paid in residential areas between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am; (2) Honking the horn when following other vehicles, when the vehicles in front are slowing down or stopping due to obstacles or signals from the traffic police; (3) Using the horn to get the attention of the traffic police, intending to get the right of way first; (4) Using the horn to let people in the house pay attention; It is absolutely forbidden to those who intend to pass unimpeded at corners or intersections of roads or dangerous places; Violators of the above regulations will be severely punished by this office. It is hoped that all sectors will assist the police to facilitate the crackdown."

### US Garrison Officers Host Farewell Dinner for Departing and Incoming Commanders; Baker to Return to the US for Service Imminently

The officers of the Fourth Marine Regiment of the US Naval Forces stationed in Shanghai hosted a banquet at the "Mahjong Room" of the American Club from 6 to 8 PM last night (the 20th) to entertain the outgoing Commander Colonel Baker and his successor, Colonel Howard. Many guests from various circles attended to see off the old and welcome the new. Mr. Howard has already taken over the position of Commander. Mr. Baker's term of service has ended, and he will soon return to Washington, D.C. to take up a new position.

### American Community Gives Joint Farewell Banquet for Baker

The American Community Association held a joint farewell banquet for Mr. Baker at the American Club the night before (the 19th).

### Paradise for Orphans (II) 柳

To the left of the main gate is the Tushanwan Printing House. Following the right hand side, circumventing the corridor, we passed through a bamboo fence gate. Inside was an immense plaza, and within the corridors on either side were rows of buildings. However, this vast courtyard was surprisingly tranquil and silent. Mr. Zhiyao first had to go to the chapel to recite scriptures. Although I am not Catholic, following the host's preference, I also went in and knelt beside him, admiring the solemn decorations within the chapel. Upon exiting, we immediately went to visit the院长 Father Lu Daomao. Father Lu had flowing silver hair and piercing eyes. Amidst his imposing demeanor shone an air of benevolence. After completing the admission procedures, accompanied by Father Lu, we first visited the painting section. Some were painting scenery, some were making drawings, and some were applying color to lantern slide negatives against the sunlight. In addition, the displayed artistic products, stained glass, were resplendent and colorful, too numerous to see all at once. Hanging on the wall were portraits of Matteo Ricci, who first came to China to preach, wearing Ming dynasty attire, and Johann Adam Schall von Bell and Ferdinand Verbiest, in Qing dynasty attire with red-tasseled hats and indigo jackets. These men made great contributions to introducing Western science into China. Going further in, passing through a waist gate, hung a plaque reading "Ciyun Elementary School," which is the school section of the orphanage. This three-story Western-style building was previously the residence where the centenarian Mr. Ma Xiangbo lived and wrote. It will have its commemorative value in the future. Now, the first and second floors have become classrooms for the orphans, and the third floor serves as a dormitory. We first walked through a classroom on the second floor, then went downstairs, and Father Lu introduced us to Principal Father Zhang Mengyu. Father Zhang is from Shandong and comes from a family of Catholics, so many of his relatives are monks and priests, Father Zhang being one of them. Father Zhang was radiant and kind, and although he had suffered from stomach problems and had undergone three surgeries, his health remained as usual. I firmly believe that those who truly practice monasticism must possess a great spirit. The rules of Catholic monasticism are very strict, renouncing beauty, wealth, and laziness. Therefore, when illness strikes, their spirit has its own comfort and reliance, not caring about the pain of the flesh. Not to mention Father Zhang, even my friend Xu Chunrong, who is a devout Buddhist, also had two resections for stomach ulcers, removing two palm-sized pieces, but it did not harm his health afterwards.

Another person joined us to visit. Passing through a large sports field, we entered through a bamboo fence amidst a row of plane trees, and there was a classroom that looked very simple on the outside but very clean inside. This is where the first graders study. Another building is their dormitory, with rows of small iron beds arranged neatly.

We also learned from Father Zhang that this orphanage has a history of eighty-six years. It was founded by Father Xue Kongzhao, back in the fifth year of Xianfeng (1855 AD). It was opened in Caijiawan, Qingpu, and was destroyed in the tenth year of Xianfeng (1860 AD), moving to Dongjiadu, Shanghai. In the second year of Tongzhi (1864 AD), it was finally located at its present site. The entire院 covers an area of sixty-three acres. In addition to classrooms and dormitories, there are sickrooms, bathrooms, covered playgrounds, laundry rooms, music rooms, and a grand auditorium, all fully equipped. In addition, there are three recreation fields with fresh air, needless to say.

All orphans over the age of six are admitted to the院, regardless of whether they are deaf, mute, or disabled. They are assigned to various grades according to their level. Elementary school is divided into six grades, and there is also one grade of junior high school and one grade of apprentice training. Deaf-mute students are in a combined class. Father Zhang also plans to establish a vocational high school for orphans in the near future to expand the orphans' employment prospects. To enter the院, one must fill out a guarantee. Once admitted, all clothing, food, accommodation, books, and all living necessities are provided by the院. There is one rice meal and two porridge meals per day, and meat twice a week, so the nutrition is very adequate. As for health, special attention is paid. In addition to epidemic prevention and vaccination, more serious illnesses are sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Students who perform well after completing six years of elementary school can continue their studies. Those who are less academically inclined are assigned to various self-established workshops to learn skills. After he can support himself, he is allowed to go out to work or stay in the院 to work. With such facilities, it deserves to be called a paradise for orphans!

### Case of Robbery and Kidnapping of a Young Child; A Woman Initiated the Plot; Victim Had an Ambiguous Relationship with the Woman; The Woman Conspired with Accomplices to Kidnap, Intending to Snatch Love; More Than Twenty Suspects Arrested, Interrogated, and Sent Back to Jail

Wang Zhenjiang, who resides at No. 18, No. 11 Yu Qiaqing Road, is engaged in the lighter business. In addition to marrying Ms. Pan as his wife, he also took Hong Qinxin as a concubine. Hong gave birth to a son named Yongsheng, who is now four years old. Because Wang has only this one son, he loves him very much. On the morning of March 24th of this year, at 8:00 AM, several robbers suddenly broke into Wang's home. One of them wore a black muzzle, resembling a Japanese person. They first robbed Wang of 2,000 法幣 and three rings worth hundreds of yuan. Before escaping, they kidnapped his son, Yongsheng.

Ransom of 300,000

After the incident, Wang received a ransom letter from the bandits, demanding 300,000 yuan. While negotiations were underway, Zhang Decai and Xue Youwen, Chinese detectives of the 老閘 Police Station, received a report from an informant. They arrested the suspects Mao Cheng, Shi Binghua, Chen Zhiyuan, Geng Bingzhang, Ma Xiufeng, Zhang Chuanming, Chen Huilin, Wu Tan, Zhang Fugeng, Shen Haiqing, Liu Jianwen, Shen Chen, Wang Youdi, Lu Xingguang, Shen Jinlong, Chen Yuanshou, Chen Yuzhang, Zhu Weizhang, Zhu Chi, Wu Er, Shi Meizhang, Wang Youfang, Zhang Ada, Lin Puqing, and Yu Zaiyu at No. 306 Xiaoyao Inn on Baliaoqiao Road, No. 15 Penglai Road in Nanshi, and No. 12 Tongan Lane in Shipinong, Nanshi. They seized a box cannon, two pistols, and fifteen bullets, and rescued the hostage. They were sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention.

Case Involving Romantic Affair

Yesterday morning, this case was heard in the first criminal court by Judge Xiao Xiefei. The defendants hired lawyers Jiang Baoli, Jiang Pingfan, Fan Gang, and Yu Enliang to defend them. First, the lawyer of the police station, Ru Bao Yi, stated the process of solving the case. Then, he described the investigation of the defendants' involvement in the case, saying, in brief, that the instigator of this case was actually a woman named Tang Jinfeng, who is still at large. It is reported that Ms. Tang and Wang Zhenjiang had a physical relationship, and Wang already had a wife and a concubine. The concubine, Hong Qinxin, even gave birth to a son, so there were bound to be differences in treatment. Tang held a grudge and thought to seize Hong's son, so as to shift Wang's love away from Hong, and also take this opportunity to extort a huge amount of money. Tang then discussed with the defendant Shi Meizhang. Shi invited several defendants on the case. Shi originally had a car with the license number 1406, which he had just sold to someone a few days before the crime, and the license number was also changed to 8966.

Internal Strife Among Accomplices

The car was sent to 同昌 Auto Repair Shop by the current owner for repairs. Since Shi had decided to commit the crime, he asked the current owner to borrow the car for use. The car owner did not suspect anything else and agreed to lend it. After the crime, Tang Jinfeng hid the hostage at her home at No. 282 Penglai Road. However, the accomplices who went to kidnap the person with Shi were afraid that Shi and Tang would benefit alone, so they reunited with Mao Cheng, Shi Bingzhang, Wu San, and Wu's wife, Tan, to devise a way to snatch the hostage and move him to Wu San's house at No. 12 Tongan Lane in Shipinong. Before a day had passed, the police solved the case. Therefore, the police station is now prosecuting the defendants for robbery, kidnapping, and extortion. After Judge Xiao questioned the plaintiff Wang Hongqin and the hostage Wang Yongsheng, he announced that the hearing would be adjourned to another date due to lack of time, and the defendants were sent back to jail.

### Bizarre Kidnapping Case on Avenue Dubail; The Kidnapped Person is Named Li Kaiwen

At around 0:30 AM yesterday, three men armed with weapons broke into No. 485, next to Baoxing Lane on Avenue Dubail in the French Concession, and went straight to the attic on the fourth floor. They seized a resident and took him out of the door, disappearing without a trace. It was later learned that the kidnapped resident was named Li Kaiwen, a native of Beiping, 47 years old, and currently an employee of Yongmao Shenzhuang in Beiping. The store is located on 天主堂 Street. Li often travels back and forth between Beiping and Shanghai, and his monthly salary is only 40 yuan, but his side income is very rich, but it is not enough to qualify for kidnapping, so the case is very bizarre. The French police are currently investigating. It is reported that the men who kidnapped Li were wearing Zhongshan suits, and two wore black and gray long gowns, holding a pistol.

### Wang Yiting's Son Kidnapped Last Night

Wang Yiting's son, Shuxian, a well-known businessman in Shanghai, 41 years old, a native of Wuxing, and the manager of the Jingcheng Paper Mill in this city, resided at a certain number on Yaozhu Road. At about 11:45 PM last night, he had just left the Paramount Ballroom on 静安寺 Road and was returning to his residence in his own car (No. 1317). Unexpectedly, he suddenly encountered four kidnappers. Two of them threatened him with guns and kidnapped him along with his car, disappearing without a trace.

### Zhao Gengfu, Manager of Xinyuan Gold Shop, Shot Dead; Also Held Two Important Positions in the Gold Market; Shot Dead in Front of the Securities Building Yesterday; Doorman Bravely Followed and Cleverly Captured a Suspect

A shooting occurred in front of the entrance of the China Merchants Securities Exchange on Jiujiang Road in the Public Concession at about 1:45 PM yesterday. The victim was Zhao Gengfu, the manager of Xinyuan Gold Shop on the seventh floor of the Securities Exchange. He was shot twice in the right temple and died shortly after. The details are recorded as follows:

Important Gold Industry Official

Xinyuan Gold Shop is located in Room 503 on the seventh floor of the China Merchants Securities Exchange at No. 429 Jiujiang Road. Zhao Gengfu (32 years old) from Ningbo was hired as the manager. Zhao also served as a broker No. 3 in the Gold Exchange and the director of the General Affairs Section of the Gold Industry Association. His family lived on West Yanan Road, Lane 690, No. 3, and owned his own car with license number 823. At about 1:15 PM yesterday afternoon, Zhao walked out of the exchange.

Shooting Each Other

Just as he was about to step into the car, a 麻皮 person lurking nearby, over twenty years old, saw Zhao about to get into the car, and whispered to the assailant, "That's the one." The person quickly pulled out a box gun and fired two shots at Zhao, both hitting the right temple. Blood spurted out like a fountain, and Zhao collapsed, dying. At that time, a doorman in the exchange heard the gunshots and quickly took out his pistol and fired at the shooter. The shooter also fired two more shots to resist arrest, but all missed.

Clever Capture of the Assailant

Fortunately, the doorman was unusually alert and dodged successfully. He crouched next to Zhao's body, and the shooter, thinking that the doorman was also injured and had fallen to the ground, fled west with his weapon. The doorman saw the shooter moving forward and got up and chased after him, until Fujian Road, he had passed the shooter's front, and quickly turned back with a gun, pointing at his chest, forbidding him to move. At this time, the shooter saw the situation and could not resist, so he had to surrender. The street police were called and took him back to the 老閘 Police Station.

Died of Serious Injuries

Zhao Gengfu fell to the ground after being shot. The police on duty immediately called an ambulance to the scene and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, the injuries were critical and the medication was ineffective. He died at about 3:10 PM. After the competent police station received the news, it immediately ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to investigate. As for the reason for the shooting, the police station is currently investigating. When reporters arrived, they saw bloodstains on the sidewalk, and broken glass from the car scattered all over the ground.

### Grain: Can Dead Ashes Rekindle? The Rice Market Reverted to Small Yesterday; What Kind of Rice Is the Publicly Sold Rice?

The 工部局 publicly sold rice currently sold in various rice shops seems to have a lot of broken rice. Is this phenomenon expected, estimated at 40 percent? It is unknown, but as for what kind of rice is the 工部局 publicly sold rice, outsiders only know that the reports are the same as the pure Xiaojiao rice they usually buy. However, without displaying the rice samples, there is no way to compare them. Everyone can eat rice, but everyone except those in the rice industry does not know rice. If the store says, "This is the 工部局 publicly sold rice," the rice buyer does not know, and the rice itself does not speak, so they can "call a deer a horse." The buyer has no choice but to remain silent. Therefore, it is most important to ensure that the rice sold does not deviate from the original, and to be careful to prevent inferior or mixed rice from being sold as 工部局 rice, causing the public to lose trust in 工部局 rice. On the other hand, if you want to buy better rice, you have to pay a high price. In fact, how do you know that this high-priced rice is not the real 工部局 publicly sold rice? It is not yet known whether this situation exists now, but if the 工部局 publicly sold rice does not give the public the opportunity to recognize, compare, and seriously check whether the rice sold by the store is the same as the original rice, it is inevitable that there will be abuses in the future. Don't think it's too early to say that.

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice was once raised due to the stimulus of 客化, but the bottom was full and to the end, the water feet decreased, the price was even lower, and people's hearts were weak, competing to spit it out. The 客帮辦裝 three or five thousand bags, it is difficult to control the market,况甬帮一辦即止,本街納胃更細,兼因市上和平谣諑更不利於貨方, therefore the opening price saw a straight-line plunge after being raised, especially the Xiaojiao was soft, the opening price was one hundred and eleven yuan, small to one hundred and four yuan, and it was suppressed by one or two yuan again in the afternoon, the Yinghua Si in April and May Xiaojiao fell to one hundred and twenty-eight yuan, still no recipient, and the mixed broken front opened at one hundred and five yuan yesterday, then from one hundred and one yuan, small to ninety-six yuan, a difference of up to nine yuan, and other futures were 678 yuan less, No. 1 西　from one hundred and thirty-eight yuan small to one hundred and thirty-five yuan, still lacking smooth changes, the afternoon closing situation was even softer, if there are unexpected events today and tomorrow enough to encourage the buying side, then the market price will inevitably fall sharply again. The turnover of spot rice throughout the day was less than 8,000 bags, and Yinghua Si had more than 1,000 tons.

Foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai, and the 法輪 Albert Sarrant of 華綸 Manager, carrying rice from Saigon to Shanghai, arrived at the port at about 9:00 PM the night before and berthed at Hongkou Huashun Wharf. It carried 24,429 bags of foreign rice, and unloading began yesterday. (祖)

Although the national rice such as 厚薄粳 is not smooth, the貨主 intends to sell without松, and the market has not changed under the hold. It is estimated that Wuxi special rice is 135 yuan, Kunshan special rice is 1323 yuan, the large market is 131 yuan and 130 yuan, and the middle　 is 128 yuan. The early and late rice of Nangang high goods has not yet opened, only the middle关 goods opened at 129 yuan, secondly to 126 yuan and a half, and the original package is 132 yuan and 130 yuan.

Glutinous rice was originally in season, but the market has been falling all the way lately, which has made the 作客 feel chilled and dare not take action, and often feels tired and lifeless. Now that the way to go has suddenly become more lively, the market is slightly挺秀 one or two yuan, and the opening price of Hong Kong white yuan is 1112 yuan, and the local glutinous rice is 124 yuan and 120 yuan.

### Powder Market Plummets

The current foreign powder market is plummeting. Since it rose slightly the day before yesterday, due to the fall in rice prices and the strong peace atmosphere, when the gold exchange rate鬆, people's hearts are eager to go down, and the native guest　 sales, once moved, will be lazy. The residents see the bad situation, and they all strive to get rid of it first. The opening price of Jinlong brand Kanfen still stood at 29 yuan and 5 cents, and then gradually松 to 29 yuan and 1 cent. In the afternoon, it was even more unsustainable. Jinlong powder fell to 28 yuan and 8 cents at the close, only opening at 28 yuan and 6 cents. Meifen 炮轰 brand did not open in the morning, and the market later went from 29 yuan and 8 cents to 29 yuan and 23 cents, each falling by 78 cents compared to the previous day. In the context of abundant stocks and the rice price still looking small, the prospects for the market are still not optimistic.

Wheat market transactions are as quiet as ever. At present, the old wheat has already fallen, and the early　 is short of goods supply. Each factory is waiting for the new wheat to be listed before purchasing again. During this Qing檔 period, its transactions can be said to be unique. It is heard that the selling price of Gaodu wheat is about 456 yuan, and the market is also looking soft.

A total of 1500-1600 bags of spot corn and 50 tons of futures were traded. Prices for Saigon old stock ranged from 25 yuan to 22 yuan, then rose to 23 yuan; new stock was 27.5 yuan; Dutch white corn was 30 yuan, then fell to 27.5 yuan; yellow corn was 30 yuan to 29 yuan; April futures were 59 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Decline, Yarn Prices Plunge

The yarn market has declined again, and the downward trend is particularly intense. In addition, exchange rates are trending higher, margin calls are decreasing, and actual transactions are quite slow. Demand for 20-count yarn is very sluggish, all due to the decline in yarn sales. However, the Hong Kong firms are slightly buying 10-count coarse yarn. As for imitation horse yarn, some of it is still in the form of dry warehouse receipts, and sentiment is stable. However, securities and gold firms, seeing the unfavorable environment and various rumors, are mostly going short and are exhausted. Therefore, the current lineup is characterized by intense contention between the bulls and the bears, but yarn sales are too sluggish, and some quarters expect a further decline to below 400 yuan. However, raw materials are not willing to loosen up significantly because factory costs are higher than before. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1465 yuan, and the low price was 1424 yuan. In early afternoon trading, it was 1417 yuan, but as margin calls recovered, it rose to 1438 yuan, but with bearish selling, it fell again to 1431 yuan. Today, 1350 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The opening of Double Horse yarn was still strong, because the bulls were numerous and unwilling to let go, with the opening price at 1463 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1465 yuan. However, with mediocre gold market opening prices, outside investors had unfavorable sentiments and started selling, causing the market to suddenly reverse and fall to 1452-3 yuan. After lingering there for a long time, news came that exchange rates were trending higher, and there were many rumors. Many scalpers emerged, and everyone sold, with heavy selling pressure, causing a direct plunge to 1428 yuan. According to the market, a certain major player unloaded 2000 bales. After this news spread, sentiment became even more fearful. The closing price was 1424 yuan. It is found that the half-day turnover totaled 11,070 bales. The amount purchased by each firm is listed below:

### Cotton Market Stagnation

The spot cotton situation remains sluggish. Due to the sharp decline in the yarn market, raw material factories have no interest in buying. Although foreign cotton trends are rising, there seems to be a temporary turning point.

200 bales of Indian Brazilian No. 42 warehouse delivery.

100 bales of American Penjamo No. 33

Further news, the foreign cotton trading of foreign firms in Shanghai is quite dull. In recent days, due to certain rumors, and the gradual decline in the yarn market, all parties seem to be taking a wait-and-see attitude and have no intention to purchase. Even the foreign spinning mills that directly purchase goods from overseas have virtually halted operations.

### Piece Goods: Factory Cloth Needed, Both Local and Outside Buyers Scarce

The factory cloth market continued its downward spiral yesterday, with a weak trend. Opening prices varied among different cloths. White cotton fine cloth fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece, coarse cloth and twill fell by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao. The price of bleached and dyed cloth was even more chaotic, falling by about 5 jiao. Transactions among fellow traders were scarce. Customer firms and local wholesale houses had weak purchasing appetite. Speculators tended to sell off their holdings. About 100 pieces of various cloths were traded in the local market. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang firms did not buy, and are temporarily delaying their purchases. Other firms also only made small purchases. On the 21st, 1900 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern cloth fell even more sharply. Futures fine cloth on the exchange fell by as much as 1.5 yuan per piece. In the spot market, Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 47 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen, and Gentleman Serge at 1 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen 8 li. Later, due to the plunge in margin calls and cotton yarn, sentiment became very fearful, and selling pressure increased sharply, causing prices to fall in each round of trading. In the afternoon market, Dragon Head closed at 46 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen, and Serge at 1 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen 5 li.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Plunge Sharply

Yesterday, the sugar market fell sharply due to certain rumors favoring short positions. The association's opening price for spot 24 coarse white sugar, for goods arriving in March and April, was initially 104 yuan 8 jiao, 7 jiao, and 6 jiao, but fell to 103.5 yuan in the afternoon. Futures for the end of this month were 106 yuan 7 jiao, 6 yuan, 5.5 yuan, 5 yuan, and 4.7 jiao in the morning, and 4.2 jiao in the afternoon. The closing price recovered slightly to 4.75 yuan. Small two yuan 5.5 jiao. Taikoo cart white B mark west warehouse 107 yuan, 6 yuan 7 jiao, 7 yuan, 8 yuan, down three yuan, DY mark east warehouse 100 yuan, HX mark west warehouse 97 yuan, east warehouse 96 yuan, small one yuan.

### Coal: Large Quantities of Firewood Arrive

The firewood business has become increasingly smaller since the beginning of summer, and users are also switching to using loose firewood due to the high prices. However, goods continue to arrive in a steady stream. Yesterday, another seven sailboats arrived at the river docks, carrying about 50,000 large bundles of firewood. According to industry estimates, wholesale prices are: large white firewood at 1.5 bundles per yuan, medium-sized Taiwan firewood at 2 bundles per yuan, and small white firewood at 3 bundles per yuan. Docking and trucking costs are added on top, representing a decrease of 10-20% compared to the previous month.

### Metals: Tin Market Quiet

The tin market fluctuates from time to time, but ultimately, due to the lack of purchasing power from merchants in Hangzhou and Shaoxing, and sluggish transactions in the local market, market sentiment has turned quiet again. In addition, the supply of goods is slightly available and has not been interrupted. Furthermore, there is no shortage of spot goods from Hong Kong firms and speculative stockpilers, so the circulating supply has not been insufficient. As a result, industry sentiment has softened, and opening prices have also fallen. Yesterday, 99.75% purity tin was quoted at 4300 yuan, a drop of over 200 yuan compared to the previous days. In addition, prices for copper, lead, large bars of lead, large white lead blocks, TC purple copper ingots, etc., have mostly softened due to slow actual sales.

### Seafood: Squid Soars

Recently, squid stocks have become increasingly scarce, and market prices have repeatedly reached new highs, soaring continuously. Yesterday, the quoted price for the latest batch of Shin Kan squid reached 325 yuan, and the previous batch of old stock was quoted at 290 yuan. It is found that the latest batch of Shin Kan will have to wait until the autumn hot water goods before there is any product, and the sales period is still long, so the price is firm and constantly high.

Study Lecture

### How to Study Pictures (2) Shi Chongpeng

2. Western paintings are divided into still life paintings (including flowers, fruits, models, etc.), figure paintings (including religious Jesus portraits, etc.), landscape paintings (including outdoor landscapes, etc.), and pattern paintings (including architectural models, advertising paintings, etc.).

The focal points of Chinese and Western paintings are completely different. Chinese painting is biased towards idealism and advocates freehand and expressive style. Therefore, there are landscapes with overlapping mountains and ridges, flowers and fruits that do not fall within the margins, and figure paintings with only a few strokes, emphasizing rhythm and expression, and containing poetic meaning. Western painting is different, and must be based on perspective, distance, light, color, and outline, without any deviation. However, the style of the recent post-impressionist school is closer to Chinese painting, and does not pay much attention to this mechanical method. As for tools, Chinese and Western paintings are also completely different. Chinese painting uses a brush and is painted on rice paper. Western painting uses pencils, pens, or brushes, and paints on pound paper, watercolor paper, and cloth. In terms of color, landscape painting in Chinese painting is relatively simple, with only ink, light ochre, cyan, green, and gold green colors. Flower and bird painting must be based on the original colors of various flowers and birds, and combined with them. The main ones are lead white, Prussian blue, stone blue, malachite green, gamboge, hematite, vermilion, carmine, and cinnabar, which are mixed and used at any time. Western painting colors can be divided into western red, scarlet, chrysanthemum yellow, lemon yellow, ultramarine blue, Prussian blue, grass green, dark green, burnt umber, and white powder, and are divided into water-based, oil-based, and powder-based categories, which are also mixed and used at any time. Chinese painting is divided into hall paintings, screen paintings, vertical paintings, album pages, and hand scrolls. The length of a hall painting is twice its width, the length of a screen painting is three times its width, and the length of a vertical painting is two or three times its width. Album pages are mostly one foot square, and hand scrolls are mostly one foot or more in height, and less than one and a half feet, and the width is not fixed. Hall paintings, screen paintings, and vertical paintings are convenient for hanging, and album pages and hand scrolls are convenient for collection. Hand scrolls are the most interesting, and they are viewed and rolled at the same time, giving a sense of being overwhelmed. The format of Western paintings has a length to width ratio of five to three, which is called the "golden ratio," regardless of whether it is horizontal or vertical.

Since the content of the picture is as described above, let's now discuss the method. Because Chinese painting emphasizes artistic conception and style, the brushwork must have variations in rise and fall, speed and slowness, and lightness and heaviness, turning and folding. Whether the shape is like or not is not important. Su Dongpo once said, "Discussing painting in terms of similarity is like living next to children." If the painting is too similar, it will be rigid and tasteless, close to craftsmen, and not suitable for appreciation. Therefore, to study Chinese painting, one must practice calligraphy. To practice calligraphy, one must copy inscriptions. With a foundation in calligraphy, learning to paint is less difficult. The ancients said, "Painting bamboo must also understand the eight methods." Calligraphy has eight methods: side, le, nu, qu, ce, lue, zhuo zhe, etc. These eight methods can often be applied to painting. Su Dongpo, Zhao Ziang, and Dong Qichang were all calligraphers and painters, which is a clear proof.

### Regarding "Marriage Advertisements" -- I am Not Voluntarily Recommending Myself

— Yue Yunzhan

Because I am an unmarried man, I am often drawn to the marriage advertisements of women in the newspapers. However, because of my own shallowness and incompetence, and at the same time, doubting the purpose of the seekers, I have never tried to be a respondent.

The reason is: the seekers despise the men they know around them, and seek unfamiliar men they have never met, so their vision is naturally superior. I know that I am a person without any special talents, and rather than respond and be sure to be rejected, why bother! Moreover, Shanghai is a place where talents gather. Since my wealth and talent are far inferior to others, it is better to hide my clumsiness.

At the same time, many men are seeking girlfriends and companions, and most of them are university graduates; as for their status, they are either in noble occupations or have considerable monthly income. Even such people are publishing advertisements to seek girlfriends and wives, which makes people feel more and more that it is difficult to find a spouse and that it is not easy to get a girlfriend.

Therefore, although there are many marriage advertisements for women, I am even more afraid to respond.

I don’t know whether they or they will have a perfect match and get an ideal spouse as a result of their solicitation.

"Those without sincerity, please do not try." This sentence is in almost every marriage advertisement, and the intention is of course to avoid the teasing of do-gooders, for example, men are afraid of homosexuals impersonating, and women are afraid of married men cheating. In fact, the so-called "please do not try" is fundamentally a contradiction, because the seeker cannot know in advance whether there will be a suitable opposite sex to respond, and the respondent cannot be sure whether he or she will be selected; and it is an extremely important issue whether the seeker meets the expectations of the respondent whom they think is a suitable candidate; you are seeking in an experimental way, and he or she is responding in an experimental way, the original intention of both parties is nothing more than trying, isn't it? The so-called "sincerity" does not seem to be very relevant, does it?

It is said that the second step of the seekers is like this, especially for women: after collecting the letters of the respondents from the mailbox, they will arrange a meeting with the suitable ones, as if to solicit business for tea rooms, parks, or hostels, and ask you to meet at a certain place at a certain time on that day. The address of their own residence is kept secret. However, in order to receive the seeker's reply, the respondent has to write down the real address. In this regard, the respondents are obviously more "sincere" than the seekers.

As for age, origin, resume, occupation, and family status, etc., the respondent cannot but fill in detail even if he or she is falsifying. However, the seeker can calmly "hide in the mailbox" and carefully review, which is really overbearing. Therefore, some people are unwilling to try even if they want to respond. Some, instead of responding, might as well become a seeker, who knows that spending a small amount of advertising fee is much safer.

In fact, I think that a truly sincere seeker should first truthfully publish his or her name, address, and all the details, and the result will definitely be more satisfactory and effective than borrowing a mailbox.

However, this is just saying, if I were a seeker, I'm afraid I couldn't do it either.

### Two Kinds of Fleeting Figures

— Ding Zhu

"Want money, don't want life" and "Recognize tickets, don't recognize people" are the two most popular kinds of people at the moment. — They are actually brothers in adversity.

The former was originally only a humble class, such as rickshaw pullers, hawkers, etc., who did not hesitate to show their spirit of exchanging their lives for it for a minute's dispute. Now, even scholars and officials are taking this as a standard. In order to scrape a few more sinful coins, not to mention ignoring everyone's life and death, they are even willing to sacrifice everything and be martyred for Confucius' brother!

The latter seems to be wearing a pair of glasses with red and green colored paper on them. What he can see is nothing but banknotes. Therefore, in his circle, he will never see friends, acquaintances, colleagues, etc. As long as he puts on a pair of glasses, he will happily go to do anything, such as digging up ancestral graves and stripping corpses!

Alas, hoarders and snobs!

### "Threshold"

— Jue Hui

If someone wants to "live" in Shanghai, they should first understand the "threshold."

"Threshold" is "the art of living": "A refined 'threshold' leads to success in all walks of life; an unrefined 'threshold' always hits nails!"

People with clean sleeves, just climb a few climbs, drill a few drills, or cry a few cries are fine; then "in a blink of an eye," "old rooster" immediately becomes "duck." There is nothing "profound" or "skillful" about this, simply put "threshold"!

Perhaps naturally a "stupid坯," do not understand how to flatter, do not understand how to fawn, and do not understand this and that; then it is not uncommon for bumps to rise on the head, and it is also not "too much" to fall headfirst and break bones to pieces.

Therefore, in a nutshell, one needs to be "enthusiastic" about the "threshold," otherwise, one must "respect it like a Buddha and guard against it like a thief."

(This is also a "threshold"!)

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(8) Tangible Friendship

Only two people remained in the sickroom.

"Just some knife wounds on your face shouldn't make your body so weak!" Yu Kun asked, standing in front of the bed. "Third Brother, did they do something else to you? If you have internal injuries, these foreign doctors won't be able to cure you at all!"

Autumn Begonia weakly shook his head, trying hard to reach out a hand to grasp Yu Kun's, but he had no strength at all.

"I'm not like you; after suffering this humiliation, my heart has been heavy..." He spoke with even greater difficulty, having to pause for breath after every three sentences. "And I keep worrying about her and Meibao, so... in these past few days... I haven't been able to sleep soundly or eat anything..."

Yu Kun forced a smile, seemingly unimpressed.

"In my opinion, you guys worry about such things unnecessarily!" In his worldview, drinking was probably the most important thing in life. "Now you've suffered hardships and can't even rest in the hospital, worrying about others all day long. Well, let me tell you! Meibao's illness was quite serious at first, but in the past few days, she's back to jumping and laughing, like a little white dog."

Autumn Begonia listened attentively, lost in thought, and at the same time, he noticed a miracle on Yu Kun's face... This martial artist, who used to be as nimble as a thief, had never shown any interest in children. Even though he often went with Autumn Begonia to their home and even went alone to take care of the household, he would only smile at Meibao. ——(一一一)

### A Feast Without Rice

— Zhong Zimang

In the ×× Restaurant, in the ×× Grand Hotel, in the ×× Tea House, every day, under the glaring lights, extravagant feasts without rice are laid out.

On round tables with silver-rimmed cups and saucers, ivory chopsticks, beaming faces are reflected.

They crack melon seeds, grab almonds, and sip Yuqian tea.

After a while, when the guests have all arrived, the host orders the feast to begin. After a few dishes, a bowl of "Clear Broth Shark Fin" served in a "Royal Product" from some kiln or another is presented first. The host is the first to raise his silver spoon, followed by a chorus of clinking sounds, but suddenly, it is suppressed by an elderly gentleman in a dark silk jacket with a团花 pattern:

"Ah, Mr. Yuan, I'm so sorry, there's another banquet at the Taozui Restaurant across the street, please excuse my early departure!"

After the shark fin comes stir-fried shrimp, fried salmon, spicy chicken, and other hot dishes, which the host and guests devour with gusto. Inevitably, "singers and dancers" are called for, so slips of paper are passed around "calling for girls," and those who love "modernity" make a phone call to a guide service to summon a "flower guide" to sing "When Will You Return" or perform "Rose Rose I Love You"...

Next are the "Six Big Dishes"—six animal carcasses, mostly chicken and duck, are displayed, but the most interesting is a roasted, reddish-brown pork knuckle.

Of course, I have missed out on three or four types of snacks. "After the Six Big Dishes," some guests are already drinking tea and smoking "Three Bastions." Some, however, only drink a few sips of clear chicken broth, said to cleanse the overly oily and full stomachs.

While eating, they engage in a good deal of conversation, but there's no need to record it. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into two categories: one is spontaneous banter, and the other is "serious" talk about "long" and "short" positions, and "newly issued" deals...

Eating time—three and a half hours.

In the food eaten, there is no main food—rice, rarely seen.

So when discussing the rice problem, these people eating a feast without rice are not included, especially the "renowned people" who eat shark fin as rice.

But some say that many guests who often appear at such banquets have a "relationship" with sacks of rice, but don't wrong "good people." This is "circulation" for "the people's food," as evidenced by the feast without rice. This is precisely the "good intention" of leaving the rice for the poor to eat.

### Elegy for the Late Madam Dao

— Ma Xiexiong

Madam, surnamed Dao, given name Liangying, was from Zhenjiang and was the niece of the renowned educator Mr. Dao Jinzhi. She had little schooling but was naturally kind and sincere. She married into our family in the winter of the 24th year of the Republic (1935). All her relatives and clansmen praised her for her virtue and filial piety. In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), Zhenjiang suffered from the ravages of war. A bomb destroyed our house, and the family all fled. Afterward, only my mother was missing. Madam searched repeatedly among the ruins and collapsed walls, crying out as she looked for her, and eventually found her. People regarded it as an act of filial devotion. The following year, she escorted my mother to Shanghai. Madam became ill and died after three months of illness, on the 19th day of the fourth month. She was only thirty-two years old. Recalling the past, a hundred emotions arise. I compose this elegy to mourn her:

I regret that Heaven's heart is so cruel, bringing misfortune upon my house. I am ashamed that my insignificant self is unworthy, bringing endless harm to the virtuous. Only Madam was virtuous and gentle, continuing the harmonious life of husband and wife. I hear the praise from my parents, saying that her filial piety and virtue are clearly manifested. Her virtuous conduct is worthy of record, and her ability to adapt to circumstances is exceptional. In the year of Dingchou (1937), war brought disaster, burying my loving mother in the ruins of the wall. The filial daughter-in-law cried out, her sincerity moving even Heaven. Sifting through the broken bricks and shattered tiles, she found my kind mother in her sleep. Rejoicing at the old woman's safety, she was overjoyed to the point of tears. The story spread among the clansmen, and her virtue was praised in the neighborhoods. Why does Heaven not bless the good, instead of shortening their lifespan? Remembering the virtuous deeds of my departed one, we once shared joy in simple fare. She was able to endure poverty and remain humble, not admiring outward adornment. Alas, great Heaven is not merciful, afflicting such virtuous people. I hate the destruction brought by the two battles, and I grieve that medicine was ineffective. In the bright beauty of the third month of spring, the wind and sun were tragically darkened. I mourn the death of Madam, her form vanishing with the grass and trees. I believe that Madam is not dead, her name will last forever in the annals of history.

### On Ticket Prices of Shanghai Movie Theaters

— Xin Fang

Shanghai movie theaters, according to their nature, can be divided into three types: one is dedicated to showing domestic films, another is dedicated to showing Western films, and the third shows both Chinese and foreign films. In addition, there are the most common first-run, second-run, and third-run theaters. Most third-run theaters can be included in the category of theaters showing both Chinese and foreign films. Now, based on these two classification methods, let me talk about the ticket prices set by various theaters, which movie fans can use as a guide for watching movies.

Let's start with the theaters that only show Western films. The ticket prices for the first-run theaters, such as Grand Cathay, Cathay, Grand China, Nanjing, and Great Shanghai, are all the same, with the lowest being one dollar and fifty cents, a two-and-a-half-fold increase compared to pre-war prices. The ticket prices are different on weekends and weekdays. There are also slight differences between the two matinee shows and the evening show. These four theaters have no special provisions for children. Nanjing canceled them after the war. The ticket prices at Great Shanghai are between first-run and second-run theaters, but when showing a first-run film, it raises its ticket prices to the same level as Grand Cathay. The second-run theaters include Paris, Golden Gate, Guanglu, Lido, and Ping'an. Except for Lido, which sets separate ticket prices for children, the others generally have three price levels: eighty cents, one dollar and one cent, and one dollar and three cents.

Originally, there were five theaters dedicated to showing first-run domestic films: Jincheng, Guolian, Xinguang, Jindu, and Huguang. Originally, Guolian had the lowest ticket prices. Recently, Guolian has aligned its ticket prices with the other theaters, while Jindu has lowered its prices to be similar to Great Shanghai. They have a feature that first-run Western film theaters do not have: every Sunday morning, they add an early show and lower the ticket prices accordingly, especially Huguang, which gives special discounts to children. However, this discount is only available for the Sunday morning show, which some say is a flaw. There are only two theaters dedicated to showing second-run domestic films: Central and Yameng, with the lowest ticket price being sixty cents.

Currently, the most numerous theaters in Shanghai are the third-run and fourth-run theaters that show both Chinese and foreign films, and the ticket prices set by these theaters are also the most complex. After analysis, most are between forty and fifty cents, but Dumei and Lafayette are more expensive. Dumei sometimes shows first-run Soviet films.

In summary, the lowest ticket price for official movie theaters in Shanghai is forty cents, and the highest is nearly six dollars. However, if the Public Works Department implements an entertainment tax, I believe ticket prices will also increase accordingly.

### Movie Star Life: Recalling the Past of Diao Banhu

— You Ling

When Master Diao lived in Qingyun Lane, Yuyuan Road, I and others were tenants in the same building, so I know a thing or two about his affairs, but they are all trivial matters. Now I will tell them to those who care about Master Diao:

Cleaning Movement Master Diao's real name is Wu, and his family all call him Mingxiang. Because his appearance resembled Hu Die, he was often surrounded by photographers, which he found very annoying. The elegant nickname "Star Photo" also originated from this. When he first moved into Qingyun Lane, Lili Li was his only close friend, and she often visited him, sometimes helping with cleaning. Lili Li was strong and healthy, and she did the heavy work, such as mopping the floor, while he wiped the chairs and brushed the windows, every three or four days.

Tenants Helping Out One night without a show, he talked to me and others about his childhood experiences with ghosts. He said: "When I was young, I went to Longhua with my father in a carriage, and on the way I saw a ghost under the wheels, headless, which terrified me, but my father remained calm." That night, we talked until about twelve o'clock, and he dared not go to his room to sleep alone, insisting that I stay with him until dawn. At that time, because he was so popular, he was also busy with social engagements, so he entrusted all the trivial matters at home to the co-resident tenants or the maid of the landlord, such as not locking the door when going out, and not putting away the swimsuit after drying it, all of which were done by the tenants.

Threatened Engagement After a few months, a Mr. Chen with a pockmarked face pursued him fiercely, but he ignored him. One day, Mr. Chen invited him under a false name. He went, and later learned that it was Chen. Chen insisted on returning, Chen blocked him and used various threats to force him to sign an engagement. Fortunately, he coaxed Chen and returned. Not long after, I heard that he married a certain gentleman (name forgotten) and lived in Model Village. When he was about to leave, he invited me and others to visit, but unfortunately, we never went. One day, three or four female students broke into the house to ask for autographed photos. At that time, there was a shortage of photos, so he politely declined. The female students refused to leave, and some even looked like they were crying and begging bitterly. When we saw it, we couldn't help but laugh.

Post-War Situation When the war started, I heard that a certain gentleman had lost his eyesight. He went to Hong Kong, and it was rumored that he had remarried that gentleman. I don't know what the truth is. Later, he returned to Shanghai and joined Yihua, filming "Yan Xijiao" and "Wang Baochuan," etc., but he was unsuccessful and contracted lung disease and was "suspended from duty." He is still in convalescence. I heard that his recent situation is very miserable. Alas! The end of an artist is like this, and I can't help but sigh for him. I sincerely hope that Master Diao will recover his health soon, continue to work hard, and bury himself in his work, so that his future may still be promising.

### Summary of The Philosophy of Diligent Practice

— Zong Yu

A harmonious collective is bound to be full of vitality. Everyone regards the survival of the collective as supreme and the struggle of the collective as primary. When the supreme is the same and the primary is the same, the centripetal force is very strong, and they can share weal and woe together.

### Blood Rain, Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

(8) Tangible Friendship

The waters on the mountain are very clear. Between the cliffs, there are waterfalls like inverted pearl curtains flowing on the rocks, making sounds like the striking of gold and jade. This is another scenic spot on Mount Weifeng. At sunset, the two returned to the cottage. Liu Yining's aunt had already cooked several dishes to entertain the guest. When it was dark, the little maid brought in a lamp, and the two sat face to face in the study drinking wine. On the table were dishes of chicken and meat. Xu Jing looked at them and said to Liu Yining, "A traveler in a foreign land is fortunate to borrow a thatched roof to shelter from the wind and rain. But to be so hospitably treated by the host, killing a chicken to make millet, is truly too much." Liu Yining said, "There is nothing to entertain you here but mountain delicacies. Please allow me to offer you a few cups of white wine." As he spoke, he poured wine for Xu Jing. Xu Jing held the wine cup, thanked him, and drank the cup in one gulp. He said, "Wine and dishes are rare, but I am troubling you too much as a guest." Seeing that Liu Yining had little wine in his cup, he picked up the blue wine pot and filled it for him, saying, "Please, Brother Liu, also drink a cup." Liu Yining smiled and said, "I can't handle much wine, I have a small capacity, let me drink half a cup." After speaking, he raised his wine cup to his lips, drank half of it, and then picked up the wine pot and filled Xu Jing's cup. Xu Jing drank another cup clean. Xu Jing could drink well, but Liu Yining could not. After being persuaded to drink more than a cup by Xu Jing, his cheeks were flushed, and they looked red like apples under the lamplight, making him even more charming. Xu Jing looked at him, thinking to himself, "Mencius said that those who do not know that Zidu is beautiful are blind." Although Liu Yining is a man, his appearance is as beautiful as a woman. Li Xin and I, in our hometown of Qixian, could be called handsome men, but now, compared to Liu Yining, I can't help but feel inferior in front of such a gem." Liu Yining saw Xu Jing staring at him and smiled, saying, "I am not good at drinking, please drink more, Brother Xu." At this time, Xu Jing's Red Phoenix sword had been removed and placed aside. Liu Yining suddenly caught sight of it and said to Xu Jing, "I see that the sword you use is no ordinary thing. May I have the honor of examining it?" Xu Jing hurriedly picked it up, offered it with both hands, and said, "This thing is very ordinary, please don't laugh." Liu Yining took it, and with a "whoosh," drew it from its sheath. A cold light flashed, illuminating the four walls. The sword light flickered like purple lightning. Liu Yining stroked it and praised, "Good sword, good sword! Is it an heirloom?" Xu Jing then roughly told him how he had discovered the sword aura in the countryside and dug it up in the river. Liu Yining said, "In that case, this is a gift from Heaven to you. I hope you will use it well in the future and not disgrace this sword." Xu Jing said, "I respectfully accept your advice, Brother Liu." Liu Yining then re-sheathed the sword and returned it to Xu Jing. (六八)

(6) Ma Fulu

Because Xiao Changhua rarely performs on stage, Ma Fulu has become the darling of the clowns. Ma first entered the Mingshenghe class to study the old female roles. Before his art was completed, the class was disbanded. He then joined the Fuliangcheng class, learning the old female roles from Xiao Changhua, and later changed to clown roles. His voice is high and clear, and his recitations are clear and bright, making him the crown of the clowns of Fuliangcheng. He repeatedly followed Gou Huisheng and Ma Lianliang to the south, and was extremely popular among the people of the South. He excels in the plays "Examining the Head and Stabbing Tang," "Qingdingzhu," "Losing the Seal and Rescuing the Fire," "Little Shepherd Boy," "Famen Temple," and "Heroes' Gathering," "Ma Siyuan," and "Double Nail Record." In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Tianjin Business Daily launched an election for the "Clown Emperor," and Fulu received the most votes and was elected, and his name became more prominent. He has an older brother who studies acting. Ma Shixiao, the painted-face actor who is currently affiliated with the Carlton, is the son of Fulu's older brother. Ma has no hobbies and is good at managing money. He has accumulated a lot of real estate in the old capital with his artistic income. Ma Fulu is the only clown to wear a diamond ring on stage. (Preview: Ma Yunliang will be published this Saturday.)
