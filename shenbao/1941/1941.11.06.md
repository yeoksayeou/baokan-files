### Generalissimo Chiang Directs Frontline Commanders on Strategies to Thwart Japanese Advance; Japan Plans Major Offensive on Yunnan-Burma and China-Soviet Highways; Chinese Troops Mass in Shaanxi, Henan, and Yunnan Border for Strict Defense

Guilin - According to reliable intelligence received by local military authorities, the Japanese army is planning new offensives towards Kunming, Changsha, and Chongqing. It is said that the Japanese army in Vietnam hopes to invade Kunming to cut off the Burma Road, while simultaneously launching another major offensive in Changsha to avenge their previous defeat. It is also rumored that the Japanese army in Yichang intends to advance westward to threaten Chongqing. It is reported that the highest Chinese military authorities recently convened an important military conference, where Generalissimo Chiang personally instructed the frontline commanders on strategies to deal with the advancing Japanese army. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Chongqing - Well-informed Chinese and foreign sources here predict that Japan will begin attacking China's two lifelines, namely the Burma Road and the route connecting to the Soviet Union, at the end of November or the beginning of December. The Japanese army has already begun preliminary operations to prepare for crossing the Yellow River, currently planning to eliminate the Chinese troops fighting in the Longmen Mountains and other areas east of the Yellow River. After seizing important crossing points on the eastern bank, the Japanese army will cross the river into Shaanxi Province and advance towards Xi'an, aiming to cut off China's supply line from the Northwest to the Soviet Union. However, since the Japanese army occupied Shanxi Province, the highest Chinese military authorities have long anticipated Japanese attempts to seize Xi'an, and have therefore amassed heavy troops on both the southwest banks of the Yellow River in Shaanxi and Henan provinces. These are mostly elite units of the Chinese army, equipped and trained with great precision. Xi'an's terrain is flat, making it difficult to defend, but there are high mountains on its southwest sides, where Chinese troops can hold strategic points to prevent the Japanese army from penetrating deeper into the Northwest.

Tokyo - The Nichinichi Shimbun prominently published a special Shanghai dispatch today, stating that Chongqing, based on American plans, has concentrated 700,000 troops on the Yunnan-Vietnam border and the Yunnan-Burma Road. (United Press dispatch, 5th)

London - People here believe that if Japan makes a move, it will inevitably be to attack the Yunnan-Vietnam Highway. The Japanese army is currently gathered at the northern border of Vietnam, less than 200 miles from the Yunnan-Burma Road that turns south into Kunming. The Japanese army has a railway behind them, passing through Hanoi to the border, directly to Kunming. If Kunming falls, Chongqing's supplies would be almost completely cut off, and the difficulty of exiting the country can be imagined. Although the rainy season and period have now passed, the high mountains and dense forests are extremely difficult to traverse by air. Since the Japanese army entered Vietnam, defense of the Yunnan border has been strengthened. Diplomatic reporters here mostly have no definitive judgment on the possible reaction of the United States. However, the Yorkshire Post stated that Japan's invasion of Yunnan can be regarded as not hostile to Burma or Thailand, so the Japanese government can hope to avoid conflict with Britain and the United States.

Gu concluded by reiterating that the Chinese people, no matter how much suffering they encounter, are determined to continue to fight with blood and tears, at the cost of sacrifice, in order to achieve what they believe will be their final victory.

### German Offensive on Moscow Reaches Climax; Tank Battle Ensues in the Tula Region; Germany Claims to Have Reached Southern Crimea

United Press, Kuibyshev, 5th - It is believed here today that the German formula for Moscow has entered its climax, as the third phase of terrible attacks has already begun. Major front lines surrounding the Soviet capital are under attack, with激战 [fierce battles] in both the north and south of Kalinin and Tula. Soviet observers believe that the current Nazi offensive is at its maximum intensity. As a result of seven days of bloody battles in the Tula area, the Nazis had to launch a new offensive, deploying a huge number of tanks to the battlefield. Soviet military scientists all believe that this front line is crucial to the outcome of the Moscow war. The Soviet artillery隊 [squad] has concentrated on the southern central front line,猛轰 [bombarding fiercely] the German tank隊 [squad] attempting to break through the Soviet陣綫 [lines of defense]. Commander Ulmakov, in charge of military affairs in the Tula area, has策动 [motivated] his troops to launch反攻 [counter-attacks] from time to time to harass the German army. It is heard that the German and Soviet armies are each遣调 [dispatching] huge numbers of reserves to the front lines to consolidate their positions, and that the German army seems to be attempting to defeat the entire left wing of the Soviet army.

Reuters, London, 5th - Moscow Radio announced last night that the Germans are调出 [transferring] reserves to launch new attacks near Cocks (an important transportation and industrial center halfway between Moscow and Tula, which the Germans claim to have occupied) and the Kalinin front line. The German army in Cocks is using tanks to attack, attempting to break through the Soviet阵地 [positions], but has been repelled. The reserves that the enemy rushed to the Kalinin front line are all mobile infantry and artillery隊 [squads].

Haitong News Agency, 5th - This morning, military sources disclosed that the German army in Crimea has crossed the Yela Mountains and reached the southern coast of the peninsula.

TASS, Moscow, 5th - After猛烈 [fierce] bombardment, the Germans have突入 [broken into] Northern Crimea, where the terrain is flat and difficult to defend. All the people are now assisting in the defense. Intense air battles are occurring, and the sound of colliding tanks震动 [shakes] the entire area. The German army attacked several times yesterday but did not succeed.

TASS, Crimean Battlefield Report, 5th - A special correspondent for "Red Star" reported, "The situation in Crimea is very危 [critical]. Several days ago, the Germans突入 [broke into] our defense line and expanded the突入 [breakthrough] point. The enemy has succeeded in this respect. In the past few days, the enemy has迫 [forced] our army to retreat into Crimea, and in the central part of the Crimean peninsula, the enemy first concentrated five divisions to attack Crimea, and now has增援 [reinforced] three more divisions. The Red Army, under a wide disparity in numbers, had no choice but to retreat. According to accurate statistics, the Germans have suffered 90,000 casualties in Crimea. In addition, they have lost 150 aircraft, 100 artillery pieces, and a large number of other military supplies. Although the German army has occupied part of Crimea, the fact that they have paid a huge price is also as solid as iron."

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 5th - Military sources here claim that the Soviet army has built three lines of defense in the Crimean Peninsula, two of which are deeper than the Maginot Line. The Soviets firmly believed that the new defensive line built in the Perekop Isthmus was sufficient to protect the Crimean Peninsula from attack. The line is divided into two parts, one north of the isthmus and one south of the isthmus, with a depth of more than 50 kilometers. The area between them is both a basin and has many obstacles and machine gun nests, making it difficult for any enemy to突入 [break into]. But the Soviet army was not satisfied with this, and rebuilt a third line of defense, from the southeast to the northeast, directly to the Hicaric River, completely closing off the highway to Sevastopol, in order to ensure the首邑 [capital] of Crimea. However, between September 24 and 29, its first line of defense was突破 [broken through] by the German army.

Wavell Flew Back to India Yesterday; British Far East Defenses Continue to Strengthen

Reuters, Singapore, 5th - General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, left Singapore by plane at 7:50 this morning, on his way back to India.

Reuters, Singapore, 5th - General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, told reporters here last night that the Far East is the right wing of India. If the Far East military situation changes slightly, especially affecting Myanmar, it would be directly related to India. India is the樞纽 [pivot] of the British Eastern defense area. He did not want to go into details, but it can be said that the Middle East is part of the entire defense area centered on India, and so is the Far East. Since the situation in the Far East was threatened, troops and equipment have been shipped to the Far East 源源 [continuously], and will continue to be shipped, but he did not want to go into detail. He had toured Myanmar and Malaya to inspect the Far East situation on the ground, and personally discussed everything with Field Marshal Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East. He also took this opportunity to see what he could do for the Indian troops stationed in Malaya. From what he saw, the Indian troops stationed here were very精神饱满 [spirited] and the environment was suitable. Wavell said of the Soviet Union that the Soviet situation was not very clear. If the German army invaded India, it would encounter a strong陣地 [position] on the Northwest border. Recently, the border陣地 [position] has been greatly strengthened, with a considerable number of troops. The Indian Command and the Soviet Army have close contact. The Soviet Union has a chief of staff stationed in India, and Indian officers often go to the Soviet Union for negotiations. A large number of supplies from India have been shipped to the Soviet Union, but no Indian troops have entered Soviet territory, because the Soviet Union has never made such a request.

United Press, El Salvador, 5th - David, a director of London's David Company and a arms dealer, said yesterday that Britain's defense work is extremely solid and is prepared for a five-year war. The宜 [statement] was made when David was on the China Clipper on his way to Singapore.

The exact nature of the Canberra meeting has not been officially disclosed, but Australian Prime Minister Curtin said that the meeting involves matters of the whole world. General Wavell, commander of the British forces in India, who inspected British military defenses in Singapore, suddenly left Malaya by plane to return to India today, after revealing that imperial troops would continue to 源源 [continuously] arrive in Singapore. A Daily Mail correspondent quoted General Wavell as saying that the threatened situation in the Far East can be expected to continue. It has been received that General Wavell originally计划 [planned] Myanmar's defenses, to do a more general inspection, but he has returned to India this morning, this 朱 [red] also points out that his leaving here is 吾 [because] of suddenly changing the plan, General Wavell, the British in the East of the阵綫 [front line], India is the hub, and the British in India's阵地 [position], Myanmar and Singapore's British military defenses as its right面 [side]翼 [wing].

Cooper will see that Australia has this determination more markedly than elsewhere. If Cooper feels that Australia in the Pacific British Empire policy making is 亟欲 [eager] to serve in a more important job than before, then 渠 [he] will see 吾 [that] Australians do not regardless of肩负 [shoulder] therefore the responsibilities of the start.

### America's Strong Stance: Unwavering Support for China, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Declares Policy Unchanged, Kurusu Sent to US to Assist in Talks

Washington, 4th – Japanese newspapers have recently launched fierce attacks on the United States, and Tokyo has frequently issued unofficial warnings and threats. However, the US government has maintained complete silence, and there has been no indication of any change in America's established policy toward the Pacific region. The US has also made all necessary preparations for war with Japan if needed. The rumored crisis of November 15th, the "deadline," and the Japanese claim that US-Japan relations are entering their final stage have failed to deeply impress the American public. Instead, they have strengthened the resolve of the US government and people. Japan is aware that the worst-case scenario is war with the US, but the American people are prepared for such a war. According to well-informed sources, President Roosevelt has assured the Chongqing National Government that the US government will never sacrifice China to appease Japan. Simultaneously, the US government is rapidly completing its joint defense preparations with China, the Netherlands, Britain, and the Soviet Union to prevent the outbreak of war in the Pacific. However, the above information has not been confirmed by the White House or the State Department. While Japanese representatives in Washington have continuously strived to ease US economic sanctions against Japan, the US, Britain, and the Netherlands have shown no signs of easing their economic pressure. This move by Britain, the US, and the Netherlands has troubled Japanese leaders, who reportedly believe that Japan can no longer delay seeking a solution to the problem. Various circles here increasingly believe that America's position is becoming more favorable. Although most people feel that war between the US and Japan is unavoidable, they still believe that Japan is unwilling to risk war while the Soviet Union is still resisting German aggression. In fact, the preliminary exploratory talks between the US and Japan, which were originally suspended, are continuing but have made no progress. There has been no significant progress in the past two weeks, and the situation in the Far East is deteriorating. The United States is now adopting a policy of watchful waiting and preparing to respond to any actions Japan takes. The current issue seems not to be whether war will break out, but rather whether the US is determined to aid China, Britain, the the Netherlands and the Soviet Union in resisting further Japanese aggression.

United Press, Washington, 5th – Representative Smith, a Democratic Congressman from West Virginia, stated yesterday that he has found "no indication in Congress of succumbing to Japan's demands for a new order in Asia." He also said that Congress strongly opposes abandoning America's position in the Far East. Congress advocates maintaining its position in the Far East even more resolutely than it is determined to stop Hitler. He further stated that the US will not abandon its aid to China, which is clearly "the crux of Japan's demands."

United Press, Chongqing, 5th – Chinese official and unofficial circles today expressed satisfaction with Washington's response to Tokyo's reported warnings. Reliable sources said that the American press's reaction and the statements by members of Congress have dispelled concerns among Chinese officials here about Washington's talks. Reliable sources here generally believe that Japan's current anti-American rhetoric is mere bluster. They believe that Japan will not take actions that would warrant American intervention. Instead, Japan will intensify its efforts in areas where the US is unlikely to intervene, namely Siberia and Yunnan Province.

United Press, Tokyo, 5th – Prime Minister Tojo stated today at a regular meeting of the Privy Council the government's "unwavering determination" to implement its established national policy. He said that this policy includes ending the China Incident and establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. He also requested the cooperation of the Privy Council. Privy Council Chairman Dr. Hara responded to Tojo's remarks and encouraged the government.

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th – The Information Bureau announced this afternoon that Japan has dispatched former Ambassador to Germany Saburo Kurusu to Washington to assist Ambassador Nomura in the Japan-US talks. According to the Japanese news agency, a spokesman for the Information Bureau stated that this step was taken in view of the current severe situation to facilitate a successful resolution of the Japan-US talks. Kurusu has departed for Hong Kong and will take a clipper ship to the United States on November 7th. According to the spokesman, the clipper ship's departure was originally scheduled for today but was postponed because US Ambassador Grew had a direct wireless conversation with US Secretary of State Hull last night.

United Press, Tokyo, 5th – Domei News Agency reports that the Japanese government, in an effort to make a final diplomatic push, has decided to send Kurusu to the US. The current situation is very complex, and various issues between the US and Japan will not easily be resolved. However, most people have hopes for Kurusu's trip, believing that he will be able to thoroughly explain Japan's viability, national defense, and national prestige in various ways and facilitate a friendly resolution of the negotiations. It has been over seventy days since the US-Japan talks began. An authoritative Japanese spokesman said that Kurusu's mission is to achieve a speedy resolution of US-Japan issues.

Guang Zhi Times - Seven Suggestions

United Press, Tokyo, 5th – Today's editorial in the "Japan Guang Zhi Times" suggests seven key points for Anglo-Japanese mediation. Observers believe this may be a semi-official disclosure of a letter from Konoe to President Roosevelt. The editorial is titled "Britain's Peace Terms."

United Press, Tokyo, 5th – The "Japan Guang Zhi Times," representing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' views, proposed a mediation process including seven key points in an editorial today, stating that the US should accept them. The upcoming Congress will undoubtedly adopt "air defense procedures." The newspaper stated, "It is time for a drastic change in American policy. Japan now stands for its rights and begins to break through." The newspaper's editorial stated, "Japan should not propose, but the US should initiate the following key points: (1) The US and other powers must stop sending military delegations to Chongqing, as such delegations are intended to 'keep China fighting against Japan.' (2) These powers should grant China complete freedom to negotiate with Japan, thereby ending the war and establishing economic cooperation. (3) The US should persuade China to make peace with Japan and stop the military and economic encirclement under the guise of self-defense. (4) The US should recognize Japan's 'Co-Prosperity Sphere' and Japan's leadership in the Western Pacific, allowing 'Manchukuo,' China, French Indochina, Thailand, the Dutch East Indies, and other countries or protectorates to establish political and economic relations with Japan independently, without interference. (5) The US should recognize 'Manchukuo.' (6) Japanese and Chinese funds in the US, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies, as well as locations where provocative measures are implemented, should be unconditionally and immediately unfrozen. (7) The US should restore the US-Japan trade treaty, remove all restrictions on navigation and commerce, and 'cancel all economic and military misconduct.'"

Japan's Psychological Warfare Against the US

United Press, Chongqing, 5th – Unofficial initial reactions here to the seven-point program for reconciliation with the US advocated in the "Japan Guang Zhi Times" commentary suggest that it is a declaration of all-out psychological warfare against the US. Well-informed sources said that the commentary is tantamount to an unofficial and blunt declaration of war, indicating how desperate Japan's current situation is. Unofficial sources believe that if the proposals listed in the commentary are indeed sent to Washington, they will be rejected. Simultaneously, unofficial sources stated that if Japan chooses to attack the Yunnan-Burma Road as its primary target in breaking through the so-called ABCD encirclement, then China is already prepared to join the war. An official Central Daily News commentary on US-Axis relations stated that a state of war already exists between Germany and the US and predicted that this tense relationship will develop into an undeclared war. The newspaper commentary stated, "The only resolute policy of the US is to use all possible means to aid the democratic countries at war.

### US Urges Finland to Make Peace, Britain May Declare War if Refused, Finland in Dilemma, Berlin Condemns US Interference in European Affairs

International News Service, Washington, 5th – US officials believe Britain will soon declare war on Finland unless the Finnish government quickly accepts Soviet peace proposals and makes a separate peace. According to the peace proposals, which were conveyed to Helsinki by the US government on August 18th, it is reported that Britain implied that it would comply with Soviet demands and declare war on Finland unless Finland immediately ceased its attacks on Soviet territory. It is believed here that Secretary of State Hull's warning to Finland that it would lose US friendship unless it withdrew from the war was a last-ditch effort by Hull to mediate the Soviet-Finnish war before Britain declared war. However, Hull's warning has not been answered. People here generally believe that the Finns are currently in a dilemma because US officials generally believe that Germany will strongly oppose any move toward a separate Soviet-Finnish peace.

Havas, Berlin, Date not provided – German Foreign Ministry spokesman Schmidt, in a statement to reporters regarding the US government's note to Finland demanding a cessation of hostilities against the Soviet Union, said that the US government's attack on Finland was beyond reproach. The US attempt to interfere in European affairs is becoming increasingly clear.

### Northward Advance, Southward Advance, and Westward Advance

In the Far East, the Soviet and Japanese armies are currently facing each other across the border. The democratic front in the South Pacific is also on high alert, and news reports indicate that Japan's future movements will focus on intensifying its invasion of China. Once the emergency military budget is passed by the provisional parliament, new offensives will be launched in the northwest and southwest along different routes. In the past, Japan has faced more than two expansionist options, but one particular route has always been more dominant. Before the July 7th Incident, the focus was on attacking the Soviet Union. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the focus shifted to China. In recent years, there has been a strong desire to advance southward. However, today, it is difficult to determine which route is more important among the northward advance, southward advance, and westward advance. All three are possible, and each has its own difficulties. Therefore, deciding which route to choose is a complex issue.

Looking at the reality of these three routes, the Sino-Japanese War has been going on for four years and four months, and the situation remains deadlocked. Japan wants to end it but cannot. Regarding the northward advance, the Japanese army has invested the most resources and completed preparations. There have been repeated attempts to launch an offensive, but because the Soviet Union has also stationed heavy troops and is on high alert, there has been no exploitable weakness, even recently when the Soviet Union's resistance on the western front has been difficult. As for the southward advance, although it is Japan's greatest desire in recent years, preparations have been initiated latest and are the poorest, and the reaction and resistance it has aroused are the greatest. In terms of Japan's proclaimed "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," it originally included all of China, Siberia east of Lake Baikal, and all of the South Seas. However, it is not possible to encompass such a vast area in one fell swoop. Therefore, for more than a year, Japan's consistent foreign policy has been to seek the easing of one or two of these three fronts in order to concentrate its efforts on an offensive on another front. Examples include peace offensives against China, the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, and the initiation of US-Japan talks. The results have been either unsuccessful, only partially successful, or still unresolved. In short, until recently, the Japanese authorities have had to divert their energy and troops to several fronts. Whether in China, the Northeast, or the South Seas, Japan has not obtained a guarantee that it can safely expand in another direction. Of course, China, in order to recover its lost territories, is naturally constantly brewing a counteroffensive. As for the Soviet Union and the democratic countries, they only seek to defend their territories and avoid invasion, and have no intention of threatening Japan. However, in the eyes of the Japanese, who are eager to expand, it is inevitable that they believe that unless the current situation is changed, it will be difficult to engage in decisive and risky actions. Especially since the formation of the Far East ABCD front, there is a greater sense of unease. In fact, the true meaning of breaking the ABCD encirclement is only to eliminate resistance and obstacles on the path of expansion.

Tojo's succession as Prime Minister indicates that Japan's northward advance is becoming more urgent. However, the Soviet army on the western front, despite being in an extremely unfavorable situation, has not lost its courage and confidence. The Soviet authorities continue to respond to small-scale provocations on the northeastern border with their usual firm attitude. Given these facts, it does not seem to be an appropriate time to implement a plan for a two-front war against China and the Soviet Union. Between the US and Japan, negotiations have made no progress, and Japanese public opinion has recently become extremely arrogant. Anti-American propaganda has almost reached the same level as the anti-British movement of two years ago. However, given the recent active and resolute Far East policies of Britain and the US, Japan may not actually escalate from empty threats to an actual challenge, giving the main British and American fleets, which are feeling that their heroism is going unused, a chance to prove themselves. Moreover, even amidst the extremely noisy anti-American clamor, the attempt to reach a compromise with the US has not been abandoned. From this situation, a decisive action of southward or northward advance seems too early at present. In other words, the timing and preparations are not sufficient, and "resolving the China Incident" is an important part of the preparation process.

Recently, Japan has amassed heavy troops on the Vietnamese border, and the Japanese army in Shanxi has also shown signs of crossing the river to look westward towards Xi'an. The purpose of this large-scale pincer offensive is naturally partly to relieve the constraints of a future northward or southward advance. However, in terms of the Sino-Japanese War itself, it will be the most important battle since the Battle of Wuhan. The target of this pincer offensive is precisely the north and south endpoints of the "ceasefire line" previously mentioned by Itagaki. For the past three years, successive Japanese authorities have only dealt with the Sino-Japanese war situation piecemeal and made political and diplomatic probes. They seem to have lost confidence in the path of military resolution. However, after Tojo took office, he first announced "seeking a victorious resolution to the war against China," and immediately decided to convene parliament to request the passage of additional war funds for China. Militarily, he has again mobilized heavy troops to watch over Shaanxi and Yunnan. Whether he has the strength to carry out this plan and whether he can revitalize the long-fatigued military is yet to be seen. This future battle has very significant implications for the future of the war against China and the safety of the Far East in general. Whether Japan can truly carry out its southward or northward advance depends entirely on how this battle ends.

The so-called southward advance, northward advance, and westward advance are by no means three separate matters, but rather several forms of Japan's expansion policy. Especially since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war and the US increasingly approaching war, the safety of various parts of the Far East has formed a whole problem, and the Sino-Japanese war is the main key. After the recent battles in northern Hunan and northern Henan, the Chinese army's belief in victory has been further enhanced. In addition, with the constant supply of war equipment and manpower from various friendly countries, it is believed that it will be able to demonstrate its new achievements in the future war of defending its territory. However, if Japan truly launches a new offensive, it will definitely be deliberate in its attempts to succeed, and should not be overly ignored. This is something that not only China itself must be greatly vigilant about.

### American Warships in the Atlantic Search for German Submarines According to Participants, Several Have Been Sunk

Reuters, New York, 5th - Since President Roosevelt issued the "shoot on sight" order two months ago, American warships patrolling the Atlantic have been actively searching for German submarines. Today, the "New York Sun" reported that, according to naval sources, ships patrolling the Atlantic have been frequently attacked by German submarines in recent weeks. In several instances, American sailors witnessed submarine parts floating to the surface after being hit by depth charges. Recently, Washington has received numerous reports from officers and sailors who actually participated in the attacks and witnessed the results, sufficient to dispel the impression that, in the U.S.-German struggle for control of the Atlantic, only the United States has suffered casualties. Although the U.S. government has repeatedly remained silent, there are still many signs in Washington that the losses suffered by the German side are far greater than any damage inflicted on U.S. patrol ships by submarines. A large warship of the U.S. Atlantic patrol fleet recently discovered five German submarines in two hours and believes it sank two of them. The report also stated that the submarines currently used by Germany are all new models, less than half the size of the old, large submarines, and are protected by extremely thick steel plates, so depth charges cannot inflict fatal damage unless they hit directly. Washington naval sources estimate that Germany has a total of 300 such submarines, with half (150) operating in the Atlantic at any given time, and the other half refueling and undergoing repairs.

Reuters, Toronto, 5th - Canadian Naval Minister Macdonald stated that German submarines are currently active in the waters off the coast of Newfoundland.

### Czech People in Dire Straits Under Nazi Rule Tens of Thousands of Czechs Killed, 200 Yugoslav Hostages Executed

He also stated that another 1,095 Czechs have been sentenced to imprisonment and hard labor for life. As for the number of civilians executed, it is certainly more than this number. He further stated that the victims include generals, students, doctors, professors, and politicians. He also said that since the German invasion of Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of Czechs have been killed, but a detailed count is not possible because "we can only confirm the deaths of the more prominent Czechs."

United Press, New York, 5th - CBS radio reported yesterday, after the assassination of a German soldier named Jung Lebrubed, that 100 hostages have been executed.

### Afghanistan Maintains Friendship with Soviet Union German and Italian Nationals Expelled

Reuters, London, 5th - Moscow Radio last night broadcast Soviet spokesman Lozovsky's remarks on Soviet-Afghan relations, stating that the Soviet Union has no political or territorial ambitions in Afghanistan and will continue to vigorously maintain political friendship and cooperation with Afghanistan for the benefit of both countries. The activities of Italian and German nationals in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union and Afghanistan have intensified since the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Because of the hostile activities of the German and Italian nationals, the Soviet government urged the Afghan government to pay attention to the treaty signed on June 4, 1931, and requested that the Afghan government order the German and Italian nationals to leave the country immediately. The Afghan government decided to accept the Soviet government's advice and purge German and Italian special agents from the country. This event demonstrates the existence of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.

Reuters, New Delhi, 5th - One hundred and six nationals from Axis countries, including 78 German and 27 Italian nationals, have left North-West Frontier Province for their home countries.

The Japanese Foreign Minister, Togo, has promised to investigate and respond as soon as possible.

### Government Rice Still Scarce on the Market New Regulations Shake the Rice Market Prices Fall Sharply by About Ten Yuan Due to Various Factors Government Rice Supply is Continuous, But Purchase Still Difficult

Yesterday, foreign rice prices suddenly plummeted, something that rice merchants never anticipated. Small-grained rice fell by fourteen or fifteen yuan, while other types of rice fell by twelve, thirteen, or fourteen yuan. The market remained weak, and only now is there a glimmer of hope for the future of the rice market. The reasons for the decline are: (1) a sharp drop in gold prices; (2) the Shanghai Municipal Council's authority to manage the market for daily necessities has been approved by the Consular Body, and merchants dealing in daily necessities such as rice and flour will be required to report the quantity and storage locations of their goods, as well as regulations on sales prices, which caused panic among hoarders, who feared that their rice would be requisitioned and sold at fixed prices, and therefore dared not hoard any more; (3) rumors that the Shanghai Municipal Council has been approved by the Stabilization Fund to provide US$2.2 million for rice purchases; (4) the Shanghai Municipal Council's actions have received sympathy and support from all parties, creating considerable pressure; (5) government rice is arriving daily, and accumulated stocks are increasing, making it easier to meet the needs of the entire city and improve the current sporadic situation, causing rice hoarders to feel apprehensive; (6) stricter market supervision and warnings from the guilds have greatly reduced the activity of scalpers; (7) discussions among insurance companies to stop insuring goods in hoarded warehouses have also dealt a fatal blow to speculators. As a result, market prices have fallen sharply repeatedly. Small-grained English rice fell to 194 yuan. Existing rice fell from 170 yuan to 158 yuan, then to 154 or 155 yuan. No. 1 Saigon rice fell from 198 yuan to 188 yuan. All other types of rice also fell. Transactions totaled less than 10,000 bags.

Although Shanghai Municipal Council rice is arriving in port one after another, it is still rarely seen on the market, so that as soon as word spreads that Shanghai Municipal Council rice has arrived at a store, crowds immediately gather. Yesterday morning, from Xinzha Road, Zhejiang Road, Daxin Street, and Dongxin Bridge, through the French Concession along the Route 21 bus line, directly to Route Ghisi, Father Jin Road, then to Avenue Albert, Henry Road, Route Lauer, Route Picard, Route Seymour, and finally to Route Yu Yuen, only one store near North Hai Road on Route Hupeh was selling Shanghai Municipal Council rice. The people waiting to buy rice, starting from the front of the store, went south and west to the front of the Longtai store, numbered 332 people. However, those who had not been numbered still continued to the middle section of Route Hsinkuang, not far from the beginning. In addition, only one rice store was seen on Route Lauer with a sign saying "Shanghai Municipal Council rice sold out." Nothing else was seen. Around 6 p.m., a rice store at the east end of Avenue Edward VII began selling Shanghai Municipal Council rice, and more than 100 people had gathered to wait. Currently, since rice stores are not selling Shanghai Municipal Council rice, ordinary working families cannot compete with the aggressive hawkers and the fierce Jiangbei mothers for a share of the rice. They can only painfully buy high-priced rice from the rice stores. Some rice stores have even emptied their stores, claiming to have no rice, while others have raised prices to sell. Some went to buy rice in the morning for 182 yuan, but in the afternoon were asked for 186 yuan. However, the overall market fell by 11 or 12 yuan yesterday, showing that rice stores raise prices in line with the overall market, but ignore the overall market when prices fall.

Large quantities of foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai. In recent days, large quantities of foreign rice have arrived in port, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Kwangtung ship arrived in Shanghai, carrying 13,071 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthing at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Among them, 10,200 bags were Shanghai Municipal Council's small-grained rice. It is reported that large quantities are still on their way to Shanghai. (Zu)

Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica rice is still not strong, due to the sharp drop in foreign rice prices, sales in local stores are not smooth, so the resulting selling prices have also softened. The initial high price of Kunshan new japonica rice was 205 or 206 yuan, especially 207 or 208 yuan, then 202 or 203 yuan. Qingjiao Kiln seed was 202.5 yuan or 202 yuan. Lv seed was 205 or 206 yuan. Nangang early paddy was 204 yuan, sub-entire paddy was 200 yuan, and New Dujian was 188 yuan, down about 3 yuan.

Glutinous rice, Hong Kong goods are still selling well due to the shortage of goods on the market, opening high from 218 yuan down to 215 yuan, Glutinous tea 200 yuan, Guoglutinous then due to the source has been opened, and goods are inferior, popular heart quite lax, sold 206 yuan,

### Wheat Flour Also Cannot Hold

Although there was no official market for wheat flour yesterday, affected by the sharp fall in gold and rice prices, secret transactions were rare and prices fell, and sentiment was weak, so prices may fall further. If insurance companies stop insuring warehoused flour, then the future market may have difficulty supporting high prices. Yesterday, Golden Dragon fell from 57.5 yuan to 56 yuan. Fort brand opened at 59.5 yuan and 59 yuan, but there were few takers. However, bran, due to shortages, rose to 59 yuan. Guest bran opened at 57 yuan.

### Gold Prices Should Have Fallen, But Ruthless Buying Prevails

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council will have the actual power to control various daily necessities in Shanghai, the prices of general commodities such as rice, flour, paper, cigarettes, oil, and soap have fluctuated and fallen sharply. Although sugar is under manipulation, it has also fallen to its limit. Although gold prices have fallen, the banks that are causing the trouble are buying at low prices, causing the prices to rebound. If gold prices do not fall, commodity prices will be supported and there will still be times when they fall slightly but rise sharply. It can be seen that the biggest reason for disrupting the lives of the masses is the purchasers of gold who disregard the welfare of the masses.

Spot gold is still being traded in the black market and over the phone. The market price first fell and then rebounded slightly. It once plummeted to below the 20,000 yuan mark, because a certain gold shop and a certain silver shop, on behalf of the Nanjing gang, were selling fiercely. Sentiment was slightly weak and uncertain. In the early morning, it opened 100 yuan lower, at 20,600 yuan. A certain silver shop and a remittance merchant bought some, but the spot gold shop sold hundreds of taels, and the gold shop and another silver shop competed to sell. After 9:55 a.m., a sharp fall began, plummeting 1,300 yuan, breaking into the 20,000 yuan mark, and there were even fewer buyers. At 10:35 a.m., it fell to a low of 19,300 yuan. There were quite a few transactions at this price. The silver shop suddenly came back and bought, and the securities firms also bought when they saw the low price. When they saw that the gold shop was also buying, prices rebounded, rising 1,100 yuan to 20,400 yuan. At noon, prices fell again, to 20,200 yuan at noon. In the early afternoon, prices fell again to around 20,000 yuan. A certain firm was still buying, raising prices to 20,400 or 20,500 yuan, before closing. Due to weak sentiment, prices fell again to 20,200 yuan at around 4 p.m., down another 500 yuan from the previous day. It has fallen for three consecutive days, for a total of 2,400 yuan. There was a high and low of 1,300 yuan that day. Trading was not light. The spot gold shop's own-brand gold was sold for 20,500 yuan, with buying reduced by about 1,000 yuan.

The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops, the Great Harmony and New Harmony shops, first listed a small four-decisive, down a total of 160 yuan, falling to 1,960 yuan. At noon, prices rebounded twice, rising 100 yuan, to 1,060 yuan (buying reduced by 150 yuan). Rolled small 60 yuan, silver without listed prices, black market prices have done small 5 yuan, for 78 yuan cloud,

### Shanghai Municipal Council Manages Prices, Rapid Progress in Progress Control Prices Have Concrete Measures, Urging Firms to Join the Importers Association

A spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated yesterday morning (5th) that the Council has been meeting daily to discuss price management matters for two weeks. Now, with the new bylaws approved by the Consular Body, it has a huge club as a weapon, and price management will be accelerated. Detailed methods for regulating prices are still under discussion and will be decided soon. At the same time, importers in the city welcomed the Municipal Council's authority to punish profiteering retailers. A certain American businessman stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council has now obtained all the powers it has been seeking and only needs to use them well. Other importers reserved their opinions on how effective the Shanghai Municipal Council's actions will be, but all believed that the new bylaws have given the Municipal Council the powers it has long needed. The importers also stated that they will fully cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Council to curb the profiteering behavior of retailers.

About to be implemented Fixed Prices

Since the Consular Body approved the new bylaws of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, the Shanghai Municipal Council can now fix prices for various goods and announce them for implementation at any time, and crack down on speculation and profiteering. As for the specific methods, they are roughly as follows: regardless of whether it is an individual or a partnership, when selling necessities and retail goods designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council, they must make extremely detailed records of (1) the maximum inventory and storage location; (2) the purchase price and date; (3) the sales price, quantity, and sales status, so that the Shanghai Municipal Council can send personnel to investigate and engage in price control. As for the maximum price limit for each retail commodity, it will be determined by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Importers Association. Once this maximum price is announced, it must not be changed arbitrarily. Retail merchants must also issue detailed invoices to customers for the type, quantity, and price of necessities purchased for verification.

Promote Importers to Join the Association

According to a public announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, regarding the Bureau's proposal to establish an Importers and Manufacturers Association, which was previously announced, the Bureau now requests that all firms that agree in principle with the organization of this association, as soon as possible, send a letter to Becker & Co., No. 17 The Bund, indicating the names of the products that each firm operates and can manage in accordance with the measures announced by the Bureau on October 31. As for retail merchants willing to cooperate with this price management plan that benefits the public, please also quickly inform the ocean firm to work together to promote progress.

Bulk Commodities will Arrive in Shanghai Soon

According to several merchants, all foreign merchants in the city expressed their gratitude to the Consular Body for approving the new bylaws, which give the Shanghai Municipal Council actual power, and they hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council will make good use of it to eliminate hoarding and profiteering. They have high hopes for the Stabilization Fund's policies and hope that the Importers Association can improve the allocation of foreign exchange needed by Shanghai's merchants. It is said that a large number of commodities are currently being shipped to China, enough for a year's needs. At the same time, they are also shipping fabrics to Free China, which are in great demand by Free China's hospitals and charities.

Importers will Fully Cooperate

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that major foreign importers are now watching the Shanghai Municipal Council's efforts to suppress prices and are launching their own campaigns against profiteering retailers. If the methods are universally applied, they will certainly eradicate all the ills of hoarding and profiteering of necessities. In summary, the method is to use public assistance to monitor retail stores and ensure that they sell goods at prices stipulated by importers. If they do not follow the stipulated prices and ignore warnings, the supply of goods will be stopped. Finally, importers can also sell goods directly to the public to avoid profiteering by intermediaries.

Jishi Ocean Firm Takes Steps

Many import firms have already decided to handle everything themselves and cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council. One of them is the American firm Jishi Ocean Firm, which sells Klim milk powder, which is also a necessity and can obtain foreign exchange at the official exchange rate. The firm's manager, Mr. Ballentine, recently told reporters that the firm's method of distributing Klim milk powder has already been imitated by importers of other necessities. The two prerequisites for improving the city's price situation are the provision of foreign exchange at the official exchange rate and the adjustment of shipping conditions. Shipping conditions deteriorated last month, so a batch of Klim milk powder that should have arrived in Shanghai last month is now expected to arrive at the end of this month. Klim milk powder currently has enough inventory to meet the city's needs for three months.

Effective Measures to Sanction Profiteering

Jishi Ocean Firm's method of curbing profiteering by retailers is to use wireless radio to inform the public that its stipulated prices are 16 yuan for a one-pound can, 31.5 yuan for a two-and-a-half-pound can, and 70 yuan for a five-pound can. Since the firm has obtained foreign exchange allocated by the Stabilization Fund, it sells goods to retailers at legal tender prices, which have not changed in the past three months. If unscrupulous merchants raise prices, customers will definitely hear the wireless radio broadcast and send letters to inform Jishi Ocean Firm. In order to thank them, the firm will sell milk powder directly to the customer and then send a letter to the accused retail store to warn them.

Discover Hoarding Stop Supplying Goods

If, after a few days, it is found that they ignore this warning, the supply of goods will be stopped immediately. Another problem is that retail stores claim that the goods have been sold out. When Jishi Ocean Firm learns of this, it will send a representative to investigate their accounts and inventory. If hoarding is discovered, a warning will be given. If it is not effective, the supply of goods will also be stopped. Several large stores have therefore been refused supplies by Jishi Ocean Firm, and the firm will set up its own retail department on Route Yu Yuen to sell directly. So far, this method of suppressing the price of Klim milk powder has been quite effective.

Police Authorities Punish Severely

Mr. Ballentine also praised the work of the French Concession Police Department, saying that the French Police Department investigates retail stores on its own and, based on information provided by Jishi Ocean Firm, fines unscrupulous merchants as much as 500 yuan. Now that the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession has also formulated new bylaws and obtained the same powers, it is hoped that the Public Concession Police Department will also take a tough stance. Profiteering by Klim milk powder retailers is far less common in the French Concession than in the Public Concession. One problem is that citizens hoard for their own use due to soaring prices, which directly stimulates prices to soar. Therefore, Jishi Ocean Firm recently stipulated that retail stores must open the cans when selling Klim milk powder, so that it can only be stored for a maximum of two months.

### 工部局積極調劑粉市　籌設麥粉平賣會

The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to regulate the flour market, has applied to the Exchange Equalisation Fund Committee for statutory foreign exchange to directly order foreign flour for sale in Shanghai. The council has scheduled a meeting of wholesale flour merchants from the two concessions at 2:00 PM on the 10th of this month (Monday) in the council's conference room at No. 209 Jiangxi Road to discuss the organization of the "Shanghai Wheat Flour Price Stabilization Committee" and to arrange for advances for ordering foreign flour. Once the ordered foreign flour arrives in Shanghai, it will be sold at a fair price under the strict management of the council. The sale price will also be determined by the council. Wholesale flour merchants from the two concessions who wish to attend the above meeting should notify the General Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council at No. 209 Jiangxi Road before 4:00 PM on the 7th of this month for verification. Details can be found in the council's announcement today.

The Rice Merchants, Tea Houses and Market Management Committee, in order to crack down on illegal transactions in the market and to promote the industry's buying and selling towards a proper path, specifically convened the 92nd committee meeting to discuss good policies. As a result of the discussions, it was decided to strictly prohibit off-the-books transactions in the market. All buying and selling in the market must be limited to actual sales, etc., as recorded in the minutes. Yesterday, a special announcement was made to the market: "Upon investigation, rice prices continue to rise unabated. If this is not stopped, it will have a profound impact on the people's food supply. Therefore, after deliberation at the 92nd meeting of this committee, it was decided that from now on, buying and selling in this market should comply with the market regulations, earnestly follow the order of transactions, and be based on actual sales. Customers with stock are advised to sell it as soon as possible. Brokers should also pay attention and take actual sales as the main goal, so that fair market prices can be based on this. If anyone does not follow the regulations and engages in unauthorized skillful operations, once discovered, they will be reported to the authorities for sanctions and severe punishment. It is hoped that everyone will abide by this and not mislead themselves or others. This is the announcement."

發售平米　擴大範圍
Fair-Priced Rice Distribution Expanded

In order to actively find ways to suppress and stabilize rice prices, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession immediately contacted the Hong Kong government back and forth by telegram to continue shipping large quantities of Rangoon special small polished rice for widespread fair-priced sale in this city. It is reported that since last week, more than 70,000 bags of fair-priced rice have been continuously shipped and have now been distributed by various contracting foreign firms to various rice shops for fair-priced sale at the door according to regulations. It is now known that from 3:00 PM yesterday, most of the rice shops have already taken the fair-priced rice out of the warehouse and sold it at the door. However, the poor people carried broken containers to scramble for Hong Kong rice at the respective rice shops, resulting in the rice shop staff being unable to cope with the large number of people.

禁運米糧　嚴格執行
Strictly Enforce the Prohibition of Rice and Grain Transportation

The Shanghai Municipal Council has issued another announcement stating that rice and grain of any quality or quantity may not be transported out of the Public Concession (except to the French Concession) without first obtaining a special permit from the council's police department. If any rice and grain is carried or transported out of the Public Concession without the council's permit, it will be confiscated on the spot by the patrolmen. The council has repeatedly notified all merchants and people in the city about the prohibition, but there are still some unscrupulous merchants who secretly smuggle it, which has a significant impact on the people's food reserves. Therefore, the council hopes that all residents of the city will work together to curb this smuggling trend, as this matter is of great importance.

昨日米價　直綫下瀉
Yesterday's Rice Prices Plummeted

Since the authorities of the two concessions have taken emergency measures to actively find ways to suppress and stabilize rice prices, speculative rice merchants have been dealt a head-on blow and are unable to be active. At the same time, all rice shops have resumed the distribution of fair-priced Hong Kong rice and have no intention of adding expensive spot goods to the market, resulting in a sharp drop in actual sales in the market. However, major households are trying to sell their hoarded goods for cash at this high price, increasing the supply of spot goods, while the way out is stagnant. People's hearts are wavering and attention is difficult to determine. The rice market began to plummet yesterday. Small polished rice fell by fourteen or fifteen yuan compared to the previous market. The market situation will be more lenient today. It is reported that general non-industry speculative unscrupulous merchants have suffered severe blows.

### 大量米棉　昨今到滬

Large quantities of rice and cotton arrived in Shanghai yesterday and today.

The Shanghai Municipal Council's fair-priced foreign rice, another 10,200 bags arrived in Shanghai yesterday, transported from Hong Kong by the Taikoo Company's Guangdong wheel. In addition, there were 2,871 bags of passenger and freight foreign rice, totaling 13,071 bags. The wheel docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.

The Panamanian wheel "Virginia" managed by the British firm Scharoulsen, transported more than 5,500 pieces of cotton from the South American port of Cebu and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning, docking at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf for unloading. In addition, "Wawa" also transported more than 7,000 pieces of cotton from Cebu and needs to postpone arrival, about next Monday to Shanghai. It is heard that the cotton was purchased by a certain Jewish merchant at No. 190 Beijing Road in this city.

British women and children in Shanghai are rushing to register for evacuation at the British Consulate's evacuation department, following the British authorities' evacuation advice issued a few days ago (4th). This registration procedure will end on November 15th. When the reporter inquired with the British officials in charge of the evacuation plan about this matter, they were all silent. However, people generally believe that due to the tense situation in the Pacific, the British will be able to obtain ships to transport the registered British overseas Chinese from Shanghai.

### 烟兌業公會昨籌商　整頓買賣業規　今日起恢復同業交易　通告嚴禁非會員入場

The Tobacco Exchange Guild discussed yesterday reorganizing the industry rules for buying and selling and will resume industry transactions starting today. A notice strictly prohibits non-members from entering.

The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Guild, in order to crack down on illegal transactions in the market and stabilize the overall market situation, previously stipulated industry trading methods in the market and notified all members of the industry on record. Now, due to the participation of speculative unscrupulous merchants outside the industry in transactions, and the abuse of the market by people in the industry, the selling prices of various daily necessities and cigarettes have changed several times a day, which is extremely harmful to people's livelihoods. The association, in view of its responsibilities, could not bear to sit idly by. In addition to announcing the suspension of market transactions for three days, it also convened a general meeting of industry representatives at the Ningbo Road Club at 3:30 PM yesterday. Chairman Shen Yanting reported the purpose of the meeting and earnestly advised all members of the industry not to hoard goods, not to hoard for profit, and to focus on people's livelihoods and jointly seek to stabilize the market situation. Then, the industry rules for buying and selling in the market were discussed until the meeting ended at 4:15. The discussed methods need time to be organized, and may be announced and implemented today.

嚴禁非會員入市塲
Strictly Prohibit Non-Members from Entering the Market

After the tobacco exchange market was closed from the 3rd, it has now expired and resumed trading. The association issued a special announcement to the market yesterday, "For the matter of notification, it is found that the number of people in this market has suddenly increased, and it is extremely crowded, hindering the market non-fresh. There are not a few non-members mixed in, resulting in chaotic order. In order to maintain the market, this association stipulates that from 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM and from 1:00 PM to 3:30 PM every day, members must follow the rules and bring their access card photos with them to enter the market for business. Those without access cards from this association, and regardless of who they are, will not be allowed to enter within the stipulated time, and it is forbidden to bring non-members in, in order to maintain order. I hope all members of the industry will be aware of this. This announcement."

售價上騰操縱所致
Rising Prices Caused by Manipulation

A reporter from the New Voice Society learned from those familiar with the tobacco exchange market yesterday that the stocks of various daily necessities are not scarce at present. However, this phenomenon (finished products) is mostly manipulated by black-hearted unscrupulous merchants, resulting in a reduction in the number of spot chips in the market, making it difficult for buyers to purchase, and people's hearts are not without panic. The selling prices have been frequently raised, which is unprecedented in history. First, the market prices of soap and matches on the 3rd of this month are copied as follows: (1) Matches: Beauty brand 2,080 yuan per box, Phoenix brand 2,030 yuan per box. (2) Soap: Guben 110 yuan per box, Bai Xiangmao 102 yuan per box, Huang Xiangmao 96 yuan per box. It is reported that the rapid increase in selling prices this time has resulted in extremely rich profits for various tobacco exchange shops.

派貨批發亟宜改良
The Distribution of Goods and Wholesale Should Be Improved

It is found that there are many tobacco and paper shops in Shanghai, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the size. More than half of them can enjoy the factory's right to distribute goods, while the rest cannot enjoy the above-mentioned rights due to capital or other reasons, so they have to wholesale from wholesalers. However, compared with the distribution of goods and wholesale, the price difference is huge. Therefore, the so-called big profit is definitely not something that small tobacco exchange shops can enjoy. What needs to be urgently paid attention to is that the factory's distribution of goods should be fairly distributed according to the amount of sales, and the wholesale prices should also be corrected to be uniform. (The market actually has every 500 or 250 pieces. This wholesaler, the same goods, the price difference is five to seven or eight cents, etc.) The retail prices should also be stipulated to be uniform (except for bars and entertainment venues). Now, try to give one or two ordinary examples for comparison. "Old Knife", the distribution price is 3,180 yuan for 50,000 pieces, "Five Flowers", the distribution price is 10 yuan for 50,000 pieces, the wholesale price is 2,080 yuan for 50,000 pieces, the retail price of Old Knife is 55 cents to 7 cents per small package, and the retail price of Five Flowers is 38 cents to 45 cents per small package. After that, I hope that if the authorities decide to suppress prices, they must judge the method of governance, and it is not a good idea to deliberately stop retail.

German Cargo Ship Renamed: Shipping Circles Surprised, Already Loaded with Cargo and Sailed Back to Japan

Shanghai Times reported that the German cargo ship Guido, now chartered by the Japanese Navy and renamed Tenryu Maru, quietly entered the Huangpu River on the night of October 28. After being loaded with diesel fuel, it left Shanghai at the end of last week. It is heard that it sailed back to Japan. It is found that when the ship arrived in this port flying the Japanese flag, it surprised the shipping industry, all suspecting it to be a supply ship for German raiding ships in the Pacific. Because the ship's name has been painted over and it is painted in gray-green camouflage. Although a Japanese Navy spokesman called this statement "completely unfounded," he did not give a satisfactory answer to the ship's true purpose in coming to Shanghai. Another Japanese official admitted that the crew of the Tenryu Maru included both Japanese and German people, but said that the sailors were mostly Japanese.

The English Great American Evening Post reported that a Japanese military spokesman here disclosed last night (4th) that Japanese Lieutenant Kuroki, the former editor of the Japanese-run Russian Times, was arrested by the Japanese Gendarmerie a week ago.

Xiesheng Rice Shop Sued for Refusing to Sell Fair-Priced Rice: Two Shop Assistants Detained Pending Sentencing, Boss Liu Guoan Arrested in Another Case

In recent times, the prices of all goods have been expensive and endless. The reason for this is nothing more than the manipulation and monopoly of speculators and the hoarding and speculation of the wealthy. Rice is related to the people's food supply. The current highest white rice japonica has exceeded the 200 yuan mark per burden. The Shanghai Municipal Council authorities, who maintain social security, in view of this, run fair-priced rice and distribute it to various rice shops for sale to help the poor people. However, a group of rice shop owners who only seek profit hide the fair-priced rice privately and then sell it at high prices. The government has long been aware of this trick and has promulgated emergency regulations for the management of agriculture, mining, industry and commerce. Courts at all levels will make judgments according to the emergency regulations when they encounter the above-mentioned situations. Xiesheng Rice Shop at No. 171-173 Chongqing Road, opened by Liu Guoan, (It is found that Liu has been arrested and is currently under trial for another case.) The shop deliberately hid four bags of fair-priced rice when selling fair-priced rice the other day,

Refused to Sell: After someone reported it to the Chengdu Road Patrol Room, Chinese Deputy Detective Jiang Mouzheng and Detective Xu Dezhong were dispatched to investigate and verify the truth. The shop assistant Wang Youlin, a native of Zhenjiang, was arrested and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Patrol Room lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted according to Article 12 of the Emergency Regulations (designated enterprises and goods, their producers or operators shall not have speculative monopolies or other manipulative acts) and Article 31 (violating the provisions of Article 12, and having speculative monopolies, or their

Manipulative Acts: those who commit any of the manipulative acts shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years, and shall also be fined one to three times the proceeds). The case was presented and the defendant was questioned. His statement was evasive. Judge Zhong checked the confession and ordered Wang to be detained pending a rescheduled sentencing on the 8th. The request for bail was not allowed. Also, Liu Guoan, the owner of the Xiesheng Rice Shop, and Qin Wentao, the owner of the Guanghua Rice Shop of the same number, both natives of Zhenjiang, ordered 100 bags of tribute rice from Qian Wangsheng, the owner of Wansheng Rice Shop at No. 8, Lane 29, Xinzha Bridge Road, at the Qinglian Pavilion on Fuzhou Road No. 515

Rice Market on the 25th of last month at 11:00 AM, at a price of 169 yuan per bag. By the afternoon, Qian went to collect the deposit from Liu and Qin. It turned out that the rice price had fallen by three or four yuan at that time, so the two discussed with Qian to regret the transaction, so this transaction was cancelled invisibly. Unexpectedly, on the 27th, the market price suddenly rose sharply, rising by about 10 yuan per bag. Unexpectedly, Liu and Qin saw

Profits to be Made: Suddenly demanded the original 100 bags of rice from Qian. Qian refused at the time. Until the morning of the 28th, when Qian arrived at the rice market, dozens of gangsters suddenly surrounded Qian, beat him fiercely, and forced him to deliver the rice, otherwise he would have to compensate for the loss of 1,000 yuan. One of them even showed a pistol to intimidate him. Seeing this, Chinese detective Mao Guodou, who was stationed in the market by the Political Department, immediately reported to the Old Gate Patrol Room by telephone. Chinese detective Zhao Zifeng and Western detectives rushed to the scene, while the gangsters had already

Hearing the news and fled: Only the instigators Liu Guoan and Qin Wentao were detained and sent to the First Special Court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin opened the First Criminal Court for trial. Patrol Room lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted the crime of intimidation and attempted fraud. After the information from Judge Fu, he ordered a rescheduling for further verification.

Husband's Kidney Deficiency and Weakness, Wife's Heart Filled with Unfillable Resentment

Hoping to Marry an Oil Seller * Deep Marital Affection and Profound Love

Unwilling to Falsely Act as a Wealthy Family's Wife * Wasting Youth in Vain

Externally Gold and Jade, Internally Rotten Floss - This is how the ancients ridiculed those who are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. If a man only has a majestic appearance but lacks a healthy physique, what difference is there from an embroidered pillow? If a man with strong essence and energy marries a delicate and beautiful woman, they will surely have deep affection and intimate feelings. Like mandarin ducks playing in the water, how can it not make people envious? Originally, sexual health is the cornerstone of the union of male and female love. Couples with healthy sexual function are like birds flying wing to wing, inseparable in form and shadow. They give birth to sons and daughters, enjoying unparalleled happiness. However, if a woman marries a husband with kidney deficiency and physical weakness, resulting in an unfulfilled sex life, how can she not feel heartbroken and filled with resentment? The wife's youth is wasted, and the husband's heart also cannot bear it. Or, the wife may even file for divorce, and the family's happiness will also be destroyed. How can this not be frightening?

However, how does a man become kidney deficient? This is mostly due to a man's early indulgence in masturbation, leading to nocturnal emission. The vas deferens becomes widened and loose, unable to control seminal fluid, and over time, premature ejaculation develops. At this point, if treatment is still delayed, the corpus cavernosum will be damaged and turn into impotence. By this point, sexual function is almost completely destroyed, the sexual organ is short and small, there is dizziness and headache, neurasthenia, tinnitus and blurred vision, insomnia and nocturnal emission, back pain, memory decline, dull thinking, faltering will, fatigue and tiredness, restless heartbeat, no progress in studies, and no success in career. What is even more tragic is the smallness of the penis, or impotence, premature ejaculation, leading to infertility, marital discord, and no happiness after marriage.

However, due to customs in our country, people suffering from hidden venereal diseases are ashamed to seek medical attention. Therefore, they delay treatment, eventually leading to premature death. But now is an era of scientific advancement, and medical progress is even more astonishing. Even kidney deficiency, which was previously considered an incurable disease, can now be treated with medication. Anyone suffering from the above symptoms only needs to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" (Reproductive Essence), which can eliminate all of them completely. This preparation is extracted from the gonads of strong animals such as orangutans and sea dogs, and then refined using scientific methods, so its quality is pure and noble, and its medicinal properties are mild and kingly. After taking it, it can generate essence and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate blood, revitalize function, enhance development, nourish nerves, eliminate weakness, and exert great efficacy. If you can continue to take it, you can definitely cure all of the above symptoms in a short period of time.

### Untreated Nocturnal Emission Obstructs Happiness

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Our life's happiness is built on the strength of our bodies. And essence and blood are essential for a strong physique. Therefore, if we want to be happy, we must maintain our essence and blood. However, most modern men often ignore this point, thinking that once essence is released, it will never return, and they indulge in pleasure today and get drunk today. As a result, in their youth, they engage in dalliances and unrestrained indulgence. The health of their sexual function is destroyed, leading to nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, sperm leakage, impotence, premature ejaculation, dizziness, headache, back pain, mental distraction, lack of energy, decline in brainpower, directly affecting academic and career success. And because of the depletion of essence and blood, developmental function is also hindered. This results in short stature, light weight, small sexual organs, and inability to reproduce. Such youths not only achieve nothing in academics and career, but also cannot achieve a fulfilling sex life due to impotence and premature ejaculation. The wife is resentful, and there are no offspring. Once old, they cannot avoid feeling old and sad in vain. Indeed, such people cannot enjoy the pleasures of the bedroom and the blessings of family, and although they live, they are as good as dead. How can this not be tragic!

Since nocturnal emission is enough to destroy the happiness of life, it should be treated as soon as possible. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Hemitol Semen-Consolidating Tablets" is the most effective treatment. This agent not only consolidates the gate of essence, but also calms the nerves. Nocturnal emission can be cured naturally. If physical weakness has already been caused by nocturnal emission, it is necessary to also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" (Reproductive Essence) to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. It can be completely cured in a short period of time. If patients can come to our clinic in person for diagnosis by expert physicians, and then use symptomatic therapies such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, cure can be guaranteed.

### Beauty: Women's Tall and Rounded Breasts Sufficient to Add Charm and Beauty

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Peonies Rely Entirely on Green Leaves for Support * Women Especially Need Healthy Breasts

The Book of Songs says: "A graceful lady is a gentleman's good match." This means that if a woman wants to be loved by men, she must not only have a delicate and beautiful face, but also a graceful figure. However, the essential elements of a graceful figure are nothing more than full hips, a slender waist, and a pair of tall and rounded breasts on the chest. We must not underestimate a woman's breasts, for attracting the opposite sex and captivating men depends entirely on this pair of elastic breasts! And all women with tall breasts must have healthy physiques. Due to the healthy function of the ovaries, metabolism must also be vigorous. Therefore, the skin is clean, smooth, and crystal clear, and the complexion is rosy and delicate. How can this kind of woman not make men fall in love and be captivated? On the contrary, if a woman's breasts are withered and flat due to masturbation, chest binding, leucorrhea, and irregular menstruation, even if she wears heavy makeup and bright colors, it is difficult to win the favor of men. As women, why are some fortunate and some unfortunate to such an extent?

However, if a woman's breasts are withered, taking the ovarian preparation "Shengzhisu" (Reproductive Essence) for women can save them. This agent is carefully formulated, and its ingredients are noble. It has been tested by famous doctors in various countries around the world, and it has been proven to have mild medicinal properties and great efficacy. If you can continue to take it, it can not only make withered breasts become taller and rounder in a short period of time, but also adjust menstruation, eliminate leucorrhea, and all uterine diseases. It promotes reproductive function, enhances family happiness, invigorates metabolism, restores a rosy complexion and smooth skin, maintains youth, and strengthens marital love. It is truly the only holy medicine for modern women.

Women

### The Way Out for "Old Maids"

— Liu Xian

"Old maids" are originally an abnormal phenomenon in society, which is prevalent in large and small cities in China.

When a woman walks out of middle school and university, and then concentrates on laying the foundation for her own career, she does not know that her precious youth has quietly slipped away. In Chinese society, which praises "sweet sixteen" and "double ten years of age," she is often crowned with the title of "outdated product." What's more, some people love women who are gentle like "little lambs" and dependent like "little birds," but they mostly respect and stay away from these "women scholars" who "talk and laugh with ease" and are "premature and solemn."

In front of every young woman, there are two paths: marriage and career. Of course, many people say: "Marriage and career are not in conflict"; however, "neglecting business because of marriage" and "a woman's dedication to her career leading to family misfortune" are common facts. In the situation where both cannot be taken care of, some women resolutely embark on the lonely and long road of "career." Because they are neither willing to numb their sensitive and intelligent brains, close their mouths that speak out for justice, and play the role of a "little bird" to be pitied; nor are they willing to sit idly by while "their husbands struggle on the lifeline" and silently follow "living below the standard." They prefer to struggle on the lifeline themselves; they would rather brave the wind and frost, shed blood and tears, and work hard, so that the sparks of joy, sorrow, success, and failure can burst out in their own life journey. Make a contribution to the entire human race.

Because of the above two layers of "external constraint and internal strength" reasons, many women are divorced from "marriage" and become "old maids."

Therefore, "old maids" cannot "play at will" or "sleep comfortably"; on the contrary, the difficulties they encounter are more complicated than those of married women. Because of the unreasonableness of the social system, women's occupations are scarce and inferior, and the treatment is harsh. "Old maids" must have great courage and a spirit of enduring hardship in order to survive.

Whenever there are "good days in spring and autumn" and "flowers blooming in the morning and the moon shining in the evening," people often cast pity and sympathy on "old maids," but they are unmoved, because they also have the comfort of husbands and children: comrades and achievements in their careers.

If you are a woman who is unwilling or unable to marry, quickly wipe off your makeup, take off your high heels, recognize the society, the country, and the world, and do "things" diligently and earnestly. In this way, ten years later, it will not be a group of "old maids" who "write sad songs with tears."

Be careful, this "road to career" is very rugged! Don't be afraid, there are bright moons and shining stars in the sky!

Mr. Editor:

This article of mine does not advocate celibacy, which violates natural and social principles. However, it is undeniable that there are "old maids" who settle down. Looking at themselves, they are often flawless, but they are forced by bad social customs and concepts, such as being old, having unattractive appearances, and lacking abundant makeup, which are all part of the reasons. There is also a major reason: a stubborn personality, unwilling to be attached to be a "little bird" or a "sow." If she wants to be comfortable and enjoy herself, she should be smart enough to tend towards the "path of marriage," which is flatter and warmer than the "path of career." We should extend our deep sympathy to "old maids" and suggest a way out for them.

However, more actively, we should correct society's inaccurate evaluation of women and try to create a new position for married women, neither as a "little bird" nor as a "sow." How about " "?" so that this group of "old maids" can marry out. Mr. Editor, please reveal how? With kind regards, Liu Xian

### The People in Occupied France

— Jun Yi

The people of Annam, Korea, and India have all tasted enough of the bitterness of being slaves in a conquered nation. However, the people in the occupied areas of France today, nominally appear to still be citizens of a complete nation, but in reality, they are not much different from those of a conquered people. Not only do they suffer considerable mental anguish, but they also endure very cruel material abuse. Throughout the occupied areas, one cannot find a well-nourished and mentally happy person. Their faces are filled with fear, timidity, and a weak, vacant look. Truly, their lives are gradually approaching hell. If you don't believe me, listen to what I have to say:

The first problem is the lack of daily necessities. Butter, meat, fat, and the like are limited to about one pound per person per week. All that is available are some vegetables that have lost their freshness, hard, dried-up yellow bread, and sweet potatoes. Not to mention anything else, even soy sauce is restricted, and it tastes like salt water because it is diluted with three-tenths of dye.

As for clothing, after this war, many families have had nineteen out of ten items destroyed by artillery fire. Now, wanting to add one or two pieces of clothing is truly harder than hard. One must register with the control bureau (this bureau is specifically responsible for the control and distribution of the clothing and daily necessities of the French people.) set up by the Nazis in every city a month in advance. By the time they approve and give you a purchase permit, the season may have already changed. (Clothing stores cannot sell anything to you without this permit.)

They cannot get accurate and reliable news from the newspapers. The newspapers either report that the German army has occupied such and such place, or they publish deceptive news about German trains carrying dozens of cars of food to help the French people. A few people who secretly keep radios are inevitably sent to the guillotine within twenty-four hours if they are overheard by the secret police. However, despite the severity of the punishment, there are still quite a few people taking this great risk.

The most distressing thing is the detestable German mobile teams. In the middle of the night, they force open the doors and search your house everywhere, making a complete mess before staggering away. Sometimes, when they see a beautiful girl, they force her to kiss them. These things happen at least once or twice a week, but no one dares to resist. Once, a young woman was stabbed through the throat with a knife for saying something unpleasant.

Living in the occupied areas, one cannot move around casually without a transfer permit issued by the government. Train stations are surrounded by detectives checking passengers. Therefore, they are almost sentenced to life imprisonment, living such a cruel life. How can those French people, who have always been accustomed to enjoying themselves, have any spirit left?

### Prisoners' Hobbies

— Shen Xiong

Dusk falls over a prison on the Pacific coast; then comes the night, all is silent. Suddenly, a melodious trumpet sound rises, over and over again. Gradually, people join in from all directions, and finally, it becomes a grand ensemble of hundreds of people. They play old, familiar songs; with this moving music, all one thousand inmates in the prison get a pleasant rest. They have labored all day in the prison workshops and workrooms. The first person to take up playing the trumpet as a hobby was a prisoner named Sha Kunting.

In a Michigan prison, an inmate uses his free time every night to make violins. His only tools are a knife and a set of sharpeners. After eight months, he finally succeeds. The finished violin is extremely exquisite, not only excellent in craftsmanship but also has a good tone.

In a Wisconsin prison, a group of workers gathers on the farm every Sunday to cut beautiful, colored pieces of wood into diamond shapes, star shapes, crescent shapes, and other various shapes. They use these small pieces to make various boxes. One box requires 13,000 small pieces of wood. This craftsmanship is truly superb. And their only tools are knives and sandpaper.

A few simple tools plus patience can make many things. They also carve many animals and human figures. Each craft is a way for prisoners to relieve loneliness and make use of time.

There is also a prisoner sentenced to seven years who wrote his past experiences into a novel—three novels and many short stories.

These facts are very worthy of our reflection because we seem to rarely pay attention to how to cultivate a hobby. People who are forced by life work all day long, and wealthy people spend their time in sensual pleasures; but no one cares about hobbies that are truly beneficial to body and mind. But from now on, everyone should try as much as possible to cultivate a hobby.

Invention

### Self-Opening Parachute

— Yong Yun

One of the most difficult parts of learning to parachute is pulling the cord to open the parachute at the appropriate time. However, recently, aerial firefighters in the northwestern United States forest area and the United States Army Parachute Team have invented a self-opening parachute. It has a strong, long rope attached to the aircraft. When the paratrooper jumps down to the appropriate time, this long rope can pull the parachute open, and then the paratrooper descends leisurely.

Fourteenth: Living a Hero's Life

Qiuhaitang stood under a street lamp, staring blankly at the sparse figures on the road for a long time.

"This, Mr. Qian, I don't want to!" He replied in a very calm voice after listening to what Qian Ruomo had said. "To serve those rich masters is simply impossible for me. It's better to hang around in the theater."

"Since you are willing to endure some grievances, then you can only hang around for a while!"

Qian Ruomo then moved his feet first and walked across the street; Qiuhaitang silently followed behind him.

"However, I'm always afraid your body won't be able to take it."

"The first few days might be particularly hard, but I'll get used to it slowly!" For Qiuhaitang, today's events are like a scene of "finding no road at the end of the mountain, then a village appearing amidst the willows and flowers." Therefore, he himself felt very satisfied and had absolutely no intention of being picky.

Hearing him say this, Qian Ruomo could only smile without saying a word. (255)

### Tyrone Power's Marital Crisis

— Pei Lin

The name Tyrone Power seems to have been deeply engraved in the hearts of general movie fans. This romantic young man, after filming "Suez," married French actress Annabella, who played a supporting role in the film, in a blitzkrieg-like manner. At that time, the general public worried about his future. But facts speak louder than words. Not only did it not affect his future, but after marriage, he happily told his friends about his and Annabella's happy union. Recently, it was rumored that they were hoping to have a son, which is indeed something to be congratulated on!

However, as the saying goes, "The moon wanes after it is full." According to recent news from Hollywood, Tyrone Power and Annabella had a rift due to differences of opinion, and rumors spread that they were going to go through divorce proceedings. In Hollywood, men and women treat the word "marriage" as a child's play, with the idea of "marrying today and divorcing tomorrow." Annabella had already been married once and had a daughter. Her marriage to Tyrone was a second marriage. If they really divorce, then Hollywood will have one more divorce case. We hope this is just a "rumor" and wish them to reconcile so that both parties can avoid suffering unexpected pain.

The previous rumor that Zhang Cuihong was rehired by Yihua has now been dismissed because Zhang is pregnant again, and her husband, Xu Ting, politely declined.

Wu Shui intends to shoot a war film in Hong Kong. The leading actors who have been invited include Hu Die, Gao Zhanfei, Zhang Yi, and others. It is said that Jin Yan is also being courted.

It is rumored that Guolian is preparing to continue filming Ba Jin's "Spring" and "Autumn."

Because Da Shanghai has a backlog of new films, "Family" has been postponed to Christmas Day. The previously scheduled premiere of "Princess Iron Fan" has been moved to Shanghai Guang and Xinguang theaters for simultaneous screenings.

Han Langen's self-written, self-directed, and self-acted comedy "Congratulations on Getting Rich" is scheduled to be completed this year and can be released during the Lunar New Year.

After being retained by the Yihua authorities, Li Qinian agreed to return to Hong Kong after the filming of "Thief Beauty."

Chen Yunshang's new work after returning to Shanghai will be "Private Love," written by Zhou Yibai, which Guolian has selected.

(Nine) Hou Yulan

Hou Yulan is the number one red role among today's Kun Ling with a famous brand. Although she is listed as the second brand, the roles she gets are perhaps more lucrative than those of the lead actress. Now she has created a significant force in Peiping, and her momentum is very strong! Compared to ordinary Kun Dan with a tacked-on reputation, her sharpness is far superior, which can also be considered a miracle. Yulan's singing and recitation are deliberately modeled after Yanqiu, and there are many similarities. Moreover, she has learned it naturally, without any traces of artificiality, which makes people feel uncomfortable. It is also enough to show her diligence. Her demeanor on stage is even better, showing a dignified and elegant bearing. Her situation is the same as that of Zhang Junqiu among the male actors. Both are Qing Yi who cannot be the lead actress, but Junqiu's "stage presence" does not seem as free and easy as hers. Her success is definitely not accidental, and it is worthy of pride for a second-brand Kun Ling to reach this point.

Announcement from this publication: Mr./Ms. [Name] who won the "Fun Test": please collect the prize from the business department of this hall between 2:00 and 5:00 PM every day within three days, and you must have the receipt stamped. Expired prizes will not be awarded. —Editor

Chapter 18: Vowing to Sweep Away the Huns Regardless of Personal Safety

Then he smiled coldly at Zhang Cangqiu and said, "Commander Zhang, you only know one thing but not the other. I have thought over and over again about this decision to ask the Qing for help. If you worry that the bandits have already broken through and the Qing soldiers will not retreat, that is an overestimation. Although we use the land outside the pass, we can [?] the Qing people's hope. If it doesn't work out, we can gather our troops and fight the Qing soldiers. In short, this is a temporary expedient, and there is no need to worry too much. The letter asking for help has been sent, and the Qing soldiers have already come out. This is not a child's play, how can it be reversed? You don't need to interfere too much, just listen to my orders." Xu Jing was about to open his mouth to speak, but Wu Sangui had already flicked his sleeves and stood up, retreating behind the screen. Seeing Sangui's attitude like this, Zhang Cangqiu and the other three had no choice but to retreat. Returning to their own place, Zhang Cangqiu looked around and, seeing no one, said hatefully to the three: "Wu Sangui has only a false reputation. If this fellow continues like this, he will definitely suffer at the hands of the Qing soldiers, giving them a good opportunity. According to my heart, I wish I could kill that fellow first, and then raise troops to suppress the bandits." Xu Jing said, "Although Sangui is attached to foreigners, his rebellious actions have not yet been revealed. If we kill him, we will only disrupt the morale of the army, which will not help the matter. On the contrary, people will say that we are committing insubordination and rebellion, and have other ambitions." Liu [?]ying said, "The original intention of our coming here to seek refuge with Wu Sangui was because he was a hero, so we were willing to follow him. Now that he has done such an unwise thing, which will cause harm to the country in the future, we all disagree. Since the world is so big and there are so many heroes, good birds choose trees to perch on, and virtuous ministers choose masters to serve. Why don't we leave here happily and go somewhere else?
