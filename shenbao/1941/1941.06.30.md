### Two Sections in the Central Sector of the Soviet-German Front: Fierce Battles Between Armored Units, the Ruks Battle Involves 4,000 Tanks, Other Soviet Troops on the Front Are Now Firmly Defending the Border

Reuters, London, 29th. Fierce battles are currently taking place in the Minsk and Rusk regions of the central Soviet-German front. Both sides are employing large numbers of armored units and infantry in the fighting. The German offensive is divided into two major thrusts, one aimed at Minsk and Rusk, and the other towards Minsk and Baranovichy. The Soviet army has announced that it has stopped the advance of German forces attacking Rusk and inflicted heavy casualties on them. Intense fighting is still ongoing in the Baranovichy area. The Soviet communiqué stated that the leading elements of German tanks attacking Minsk and Rusk have been stopped by Soviet forces and have suffered considerable losses. Fierce fighting is underway in the Minsk and Baranovichy areas. German infantry are attempting to link up with their leading tank units. However, due to the valiant resistance and counter-attacks of the Soviet army, the German advance has been contained and heavy casualties have been inflicted. Large-scale tank warfare is continuing in the Rusk area. The Soviet Air Force has inflicted significant damage on German tanks. The results of the battle are currently under review. The communiqué also mentioned the situation on the northern front, stating that German forces have repeatedly conducted land reconnaissance along the entire Soviet-Finnish border, supported by artillery fire. However, all attempts to penetrate Soviet territory have failed. Other Soviet troops on the front are now firmly defending the border.

Reuters, London, 29th. The largest war between the Soviet Union and Germany, which has lasted for a week, is currently taking place in the Minsk area. It is reported that Soviet and German armored units have engaged in fierce fighting in the area. News from Berlin indicates that German tank formations near Minsk have broken through the Soviet lines. It is also reported that a major battle is about to erupt in the Bilykavichuk area, 150 miles west of Minsk. Yesterday, the German radio station stated that the German army is conducting both offensive and defensive operations. Fierce fighting has broken out in Leck (85 miles northeast of Lviv and 250 miles southwest of Minsk).

TASS, Moscow, 29th. The Soviet Information Bureau released the following latest war report tonight: (1) On the 28th, when our troops withdrew to new positions, the covering forces fought extremely fiercely, inflicting significant defeats on the enemy. In the Shalay area, our troops captured many enemies, most of whom were intoxicated. (2) In the Minsk area, Red Army units continued to successfully fight against enemy tank units, preventing their eastward advance. According to preliminary investigations, 300 enemy tanks of the 39th Tank Regiment were destroyed in that area on the 27th. (3) A large tank battle is underway in the Rusk area, involving more than 4,000 tanks. This type of warfare is still in progress. (4) Fierce fighting is underway in the Lviv area, and our troops inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. (5) Our air force conducted extremely successful air battles and also assisted the army in launching fierce attacks. When our air force bombed the Turcha area, it destroyed two enemy armored ships on the Danube River. (6) In other areas, our troops are firmly holding their positions.

TASS, Moscow, 29th. The Soviet Information Bureau has just released the following latest war report: "Throughout the night of the 28th, our troops continued to fight valiantly. The fighting in the Minsk and Rusk areas was particularly intense. In the Minsk area, our tank units, air force, and artillery used lightning strikes to defeat enemy tank units. The headquarters of the enemy's 39th Tank Regiment was also destroyed. In this battle, our army captured a large number of spoils of war and war documents, and also captured a large number of German officers and soldiers. In the Rusk and Lviv areas, our troops fought against enemy tank units throughout the night. The enemy attempted to flank Lviv, but were repulsed by our troops. Lviv is now in our hands. The results of this battle are under investigation. On the Bessarabian front, our cavalry annihilated the enemy's 6th Infantry Regiment (which was attempting to cross the Prut River). As a result of the fighting along the Danube River, our side captured more than 300 enemy soldiers again. From Bilimiis to the Black Sea, the enemy repeatedly attempted to break through our lines, but were repelled. Our troops are now firmly defending the positions on this line. On the 27th, our air force bombed enemy motorcycle and mechanized units in the Shalay, Vilnius, Minsk, and Rusk areas, inflicting significant losses on enemy tanks."

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 29th. The German authorities responsible stated in a supplementary war report yesterday that the German authorities are still maintaining silence on the situation on the Eastern Front in order to prevent the Soviet authorities from learning about the unfavorable position of the Soviet troops on the front. The Soviet Information Bureau yesterday released news of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the north, which is sufficient to confirm the advantages occupied by the German army. Since Hungary joined the anti-Soviet war, the anti-Bolshevik front in the east has now been unified. The Soviet troops in the Carpathian Mountains region of Hungary have also been pushed back as a result. Currently, the flanks of the Soviet troops have been threatened. It is reported that fighting has broken out in the Lviv area. The German Air Force has an absolute advantage on the Eastern Front, bombing the enemy's air force and army every day. German nighttime air defenses are extremely tight, and a total of 17 enemy aircraft were shot down by German anti-aircraft guns in one night.

### German Troops Advance North Through Finland, Attempting to Attack Murmansk

Reuters, London, 29th. According to news from the Swedish capital yesterday, German troops have launched an attack on Soviet territory in the Arctic. The Swedish newspaper Berlin reported that Nazi forces departing from Norway are currently advancing through northern Finland towards the Kola Peninsula in the northernmost part of the Soviet Union. Their primary target appears to be the Soviet port of Murmansk. In a decisive battle, the Soviet Union has been transporting supplies from the United States through this port. According to reports from Berlin, the German troops advancing east along the only road in the frozen wilderness of northern Finland are Alpine troops and bridge-building engineers. At the same time, German bomber squadrons have taken off to attack Soviet underground aircraft hangars on the Kola Peninsula. Finnish artillery units have begun shelling Soviet defenses around Hanko Port. This port is located at the southern tip of Finland and was leased to the Soviet Union after the Soviet-Finnish War last year. Soviet aircraft based in Hanko are extremely active, bombing the surrounding countryside, especially near Aikanaas Port. Travelers arriving in the Swedish capital said that on Wednesday and Thursday, Soviet aircraft flew over the Aland Islands, but did not drop bombs. These islands were demilitarized last year at the request of Moscow by Finland. However, reports from Berlin stated that Finland has now sent troops to the Aland Islands. According to reports from the Finnish capital in the Swedish capital's newspaper, the eight Soviet consuls and thirty staff members stationed on the Aland Islands have arrived in the Finnish capital. The Soviet Minister to Finland and a portion of the staff were still in the Finnish capital on Friday night. However, some staff members had already left several days ago. The Soviet Legation is now guarded by soldiers.

Reuters, Berlin, 29th. Finnish Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim issued a military order from his headquarters this morning. According to a dispatch from the Finnish capital received by the German official news agency, the military order stated that the results of our army's campaign last winter were a painful peace. However, our country continues to face threats. This peace is only a truce and has now been declared canceled. Finally, he appealed to the entire nation to unite against the enemy.

### Mines Laid in Swedish Waters

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 29th. The Swedish Minister of the Navy announced yesterday that, in order to safeguard Swedish neutrality, mines have been laid in the waters southeast of Åland. Ships sailing in that area should pay attention to the navigational regulations for that area.

Reuters, Stockholm, 29th. Newspapers in Helsinki stated that Sweden's preparations to facilitate the passage of German troops to suppress Communism show that Sweden has expressed its pragmatic policy. The development of the same spirit can be seen from now on. According to the Swedish foreign ministry spokesman's announcement of the concession allowing German troops to pass through, it was solemnly declared that this was a special temporary measure and would not be repeated.

### Close Contact Between Britain and the United States, Discussing the Situation in the Soviet Union, Britain and Public Opinion Advocate Launching an Attack on Germany to Distract German Forces on the Eastern Battlefield

Reuters, London, 29th. British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Ambassador Winant held a long conversation on Saturday afternoon.

Reuters, Washington, 29th. British Ambassador to the United States Halifax visited the State Department twice yesterday. The ambassador and Undersecretary of State Welles discussed the situation in the Soviet Union.

Reuters, Moscow, 29th. British Ambassador Cripps was formally received by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov after arriving in Moscow yesterday with the British military mission. Shortly afterwards, the British Ambassador met with the Soviet Foreign Minister again. British delegation members are now in contact with various Soviet ministers in order to provide the Soviet Union with the most rapid assistance possible.

United Press, London, 29th. Most of the British newspapers and public opinion advocate that the British army and navy should immediately launch a joint attack on the coasts of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway in order to disperse the German forces attacking the Eastern battlefield, to strike at the Nazi preparations for the invasion of Britain, and to give the people in the occupied areas excitement. Some people in Britain often dream of a full-scale offensive landing on the European continent by a large expeditionary force, first gaining a foothold. However, sober military strategists believe that this matter is too large, and the British army is still in the equipping stage, and should not be held until its strength is sufficient to crush German resistance.

Editorial

### Sino-US Cooperation and Diplomacy

Recently, the process of American aid to China is being actively and gradually promoted. According to yesterday's news: Mr. Owen Lattimore, a well-known American scholar of Eastern problems, has been recommended by the American President and appointed as a political advisor to the highest military and political authorities in China; at the same time, Mr. Quo Tai-chi, the new Chinese Foreign Minister who is known internationally for advocating the ABC policy, has also arrived in Chongqing via the Burma Road after returning from London via the United States, and is about to take office as Foreign Minister. China's international environment in the four years of war has been the best recently, and the diplomatic strategy is suitable for this time to be refreshed according to actual needs. The US authorities have recommended to China the scholar who can most deeply understand China, so as to achieve the effect of assistance. This not only symbolizes the increasingly close cooperation between China and the United States and various democratic countries, but also can be imagined that it will be able to promote the completion of the great cause of anti-aggression in the Far East.

China's mobilization of resistance has now lasted for four years. During this extraordinary period, from administration to military affairs, from construction to economy, everything is changing with each passing day. However, the most obvious and visible effect to the world is diplomacy. Recalling the beginning of the war, the sympathy of people from all countries for China was not necessarily less than today, and the international political situation was becoming increasingly bleak. Even in democratic countries, there were often concerns about harming their own interests. Therefore, the international assistance that China received at that time was only partial measures from one or two friendly countries, and the amount was very small. It was not only unable to constitute a part of the important national policy of democratic countries. However, as time changes and the world is in turmoil, those who were unable to effectively support China in stopping aggression have now gradually decided to personally suffer the impact of the war. Therefore, they have truly realized the inseparable connection between China's war and the stability of the world order. In the minds of the most enlightened politicians in democratic countries, the task of aiding China is regarded as being on par with resisting Nazi aggression, and is gradually moving towards active implementation. This profound friendship is very precious. This is indeed due to the objective situation, and it is not just a fluke for China. Compare it with Japan in the past four years: As early as May 1938, when the first Konoe Cabinet was reorganized and General Ugaki was appointed as Foreign Minister, the responsibility for "resolving the incident" and opening up the isolated situation was entrusted to diplomacy. Although the cabinet has been reorganized several times since then, the position of Foreign Minister has been the life of the cabinet, and they all have high hopes for diplomacy. However, even with the high hopes of Ugaki and Nomura, and the talent of Arita and Matsuoka, the policies have been changed repeatedly and many attempts have been made. As a result, not only has nothing been achieved, but the more they struggle, the more difficult it becomes. After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the friendship and estrangement between friends and enemies in the international community has been completely clarified. Japan alone is still lingering in between, unable to make a decision, as pointed out in yesterday's editorial of this newspaper. The distinction between more help and less help is clear. In terms of the success or failure of diplomacy, it is enough to imply the trend of the future for both China and Japan.

However, this does not mean that diplomacy can determine everything, nor does it mean that China's diplomatic achievements can be complacent. The success or failure of war depends on the comparison of the sum of national power, and diplomacy is only its obvious indicator. In history, there are indeed precedents for using external operations to save the country's dangerous situation, such as the lobbyists in the Six Kingdoms, and Talleyrand and Cavour in France and Italy, but they are by no means the general norm. The international status of a country is proportional to its comprehensive achievements in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, and it must also depend on whether its national policy is in line with justice and fairness. Apart from this, if you only expect a miracle in diplomacy, even a powerful country like Japan will end up as described above, let alone others. Furthermore, examining the current international situation in the Far East, the Sino-US-British-Soviet joint resistance to aggression that the world has always yearned for has now gradually emerged with the Soviet-German war, which is truly gratifying. However, in reality, this future only has its possibility in objective terms. Between Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union, their positions and interests in the two major anti-aggression wars in Europe and Asia are roughly the same. However, due to the incomplete maturity of the actual opportunities, not only is there little parallel and unified planning between them, but their measures also have their own different mechanisms. For example, the advocates of the US emphasis on Europe and light on Asia have recently suffered a major setback, while the Soviet Union has not regarded the Far East as being on par with its resistance to the Nazis, so that those who have entrusted their eastern border security to the neutrality agreement and the resolution of commercial border disputes may soon see a repeat of the 1919 Eastern Siberian incident. It goes without saying that two-front warfare is deeply dreaded by any country, and the joint forces of China, the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union are more than enough to suppress aggression throughout the world. The current major regret is that the planning of this alliance is still lacking in the Far East. Britain and the Soviet Union are now focusing all their efforts on the great war on the European continent. Therefore, how to promote the realization of this united anti-aggression front, so as to achieve the effect of reversing the chaos and restoring order in the Far East as soon as possible, the responsibility of China and the United States is very heavy, and it is especially the heavy responsibility of Foreign Minister Guo and Mr. Lattimore after they come to China. Dare to use this idea to question the Chinese and American governments and people.

### Soviet Paratroopers Land in Romania, Fighting Breaks Out on the Hungarian Border

United Press, Bucharest, 29th. The German and Romanian High Commands issued a communiqué last night stating that German and Romanian troops continued to break through Red Army units on the front from Bukovina to the Black Sea and repelled several Soviet counterattacks. It also stated, "German and Romanian troops have completed their missions, and the enemy's attempts to counterattack have been frustrated. Soviet paratroopers landed in several strongholds, but most were captured." "Soviet aircraft bombed the areas of Iasi, Busal, Galati, and Constanta." It also stated that 103 enemy aircraft have been destroyed in recent days, while our army has lost only three. The communiqué also stated that two Soviet destroyers appeared outside the port of Constanta in the Black Sea on June 26. "The Moskva was sunk, and another one may have been injured."

Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 29th. The Soviet torpedo cruiser "Moskva" in the Black Sea has been sunk. The ship has a displacement of 1,895 tons, a speed of 35 knots, five 13 cm guns, two 7.5 cm guns, three anti-aircraft guns, and six torpedo tubes. It was completed in 1937 and is the latest type of Soviet warship.

Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 29th. According to reports from British and Soviet radio stations, the Romanian oil center of Ploiesti was bombed, and its oil refineries caught fire. This has been confirmed here yesterday.

Haitong News Agency, Budapest, 29th. According to the Hungarian military department, Soviet aircraft bombed the two cities of Nagybánya and Darabfarva on the 27th, but there was not much damage. Yesterday, several small battles broke out between the Soviet and Hungarian armies on the border. Hungarian troops have crossed the border in several places to pursue the enemy army.

### British Reporter Discusses German Strategy, Attempts to Launch a Large-Scale Attack on Moscow

Reuters, London, 29th. The Reuters military reporter stated that the Soviet-German war has been going on for a week, and the war situation is quite intense. It is still too early to clearly understand the strategic objectives of the Nazis. However, observing the current developments, several judgments can be made. A week ago, the reporter said that the German army might launch two major attacks, one against Kyiv and one against Vilnius, and then take Smolensk and spy on Moscow. The developments of last week have shown that these two attacks have already been implemented, with a lot of troops and strong attacks. However, it is not until the results of the great war currently underway along the entire broad front are clearly visible that the second step of action in the future can be determined. Regardless of what kind of war results are obtained, and regardless of where the weakness is found, it is bound to tilt its support troops in the direction where progress has already been made, and expand its gains with all its strength. This is the strategy used by the German army. This strategy is applicable to a front that is 20 miles long or 200 miles long or, as it is now, 1,500 miles long. The weakness of the Soviet army's front is clearly in the north and not in the south, because the north has fewer obstacles and is conducive to advancing, unlike the south which has the Ganglilian Mountains of the Carpathian Mountains and the Prut River, the Southern Bug River and the Dniester River running through it, which are obstacles to direct eastward advance. The Soviet Union also seems to have thicker troops in the south than in the north. However, at this time, we cannot make a definite statement on the distribution of Soviet troops. But one thing is now clear: the German army's advance is now blocked on the line from Limburg to the south for 500 miles to the Black Sea. As for the north and northeast, the German army has made some progress. In the Minsk area, the German army has penetrated 200 miles. Germany is still promoting its fresh troops here to replenish the front-line troops. At the same time, for the south, it only wants to involve the Soviet army with the troops it has already arrived at. The purpose of the German staff at this time is probably to point directly at Moscow with heavy troops after finding the weakness, in order to break the center of the Soviet Union and divide the Soviet army into two halves. Moscow is not only the concentration point of the whole country politically, but also in terms of railway transportation and commerce. If this city is lost, it will be a great blow to the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union will definitely do its best to stop it. The German army's trend towards Minsk seems to be only a bold action of a large army fleeing forward, and did not make the Soviet army's front there mess up, because the Soviet army seems to be giving it a heavy blow with a powerful counterattack. In terms of intention, the German side seems to be using the same method to assemble so-called reserve forces and counterattack and cut off the enemy army that has broken through the front line, so as to make a more fierce advance on Moscow in order to obtain a more decisive effect. This is the right track of using new-style war equipment to make new-style warfare, because it is to maintain the gains made in flat and unimpeded places, not to guard the positions with heavy troops, but to use the support troops to use the greatest speed and give a powerful hammer blow to the flanks of the enemy army that has broken through the positions and rushed in. The Soviet army has not only fought very bravely in the past week, but also has been well-regulated, and is now gradually getting the support of its air force, but its air force's bombing behind the German front has not yet reached the point where it can produce an effect worth talking about.

### German Special War Bulletin

Haitong News Agency, 19th, from the German Führer's Headquarters: The German High Command issued the following special war bulletin from the Führer's Headquarters:

Number One: In order to eliminate the threat from the East and West, the German army launched an attack on the enemy at 3:00 AM on the 22nd of this month. The German air force attacked the enemy at dawn. Although the number of Soviet aircraft was large, the German aircraft seized air superiority over the Eastern Front on the 22nd, severely damaging the Soviet air force. A total of 322 Soviet aircraft were shot down in air combat, and the Soviet aircraft destroyed at airfields totaled 1,811 by the evening of the 22nd. On that day, the German aircraft lost only 35 aircraft.

Number Two: On the morning of the 22nd of this month, the German army on the Eastern Front crossed the long German-Soviet border, breaking through the prepared Soviet troops and key Soviet border fortresses. Some were breached on the first day. The Soviet army launched fierce counterattacks, which were all repelled and suffered heavy losses. The German air force assisted in the battle and achieved considerable results.

Number Three: On the 23rd of this month, the enemy launched a fierce counterattack against the German vanguard, resulting in fierce fighting. The German army won, and the Soviet army was defeated in bloody melee combat. After fierce battles, the German army occupied the Grodno fortress. The Soviet air force suffered heavy losses on that day. By the evening of the 23rd, 2,582 Soviet aircraft had been destroyed. Number Four: The Brest-Litovsk fortress, after being heavily bombarded by heavy artillery, fell into the hands of the German army on the 24th of this month. After reaching Vilnius and Kaunas, the German vanguard occupied the two cities on the same day.

Number Five: The Soviet army attacked the German army with a large number of tanks, attempting to stop the German advance. The German tank corps and anti-tank gun units, assisted by aircraft and anti-aircraft gun units, still controlled the battlefield. The new Soviet giant tanks were destroyed due to the bravery of German soldiers and the superiority of weapons. In the four days after the outbreak of the war, the German army destroyed 1,200 Soviet tanks. The German air force also destroyed 97 tanks, it is said.

Number Six: The German army in the Baltic region reached the Daugava River on the 26th of this month and crossed the river in several places. Daugavpils fell into the hands of the German army. The enemy attempted to stop the German advance but ultimately failed.

Number Seven: German warships and submarines repeatedly attacked the Soviet navy. A Soviet destroyer was sunk by a mine in the eastern Baltic Sea. The cruiser "Gorky" was also severely damaged. German submarines destroyed three Soviet submarines. German motor torpedo boats sank two enemy destroyers, one torpedo boat, and one submarine. Two Soviet destroyers attempted to attack the port of Constanța but were repelled by the coastal artillery. One was destroyed, and the other fled in panic.

Number Eight: After two days of fierce fighting, the German tank corps ended the large-scale tank battle north of Kaunas on the 26th of this month, encircling and annihilating several enemy tank divisions, capturing more than 200 Soviet tanks, including 29 heavy tanks, and capturing more than 150 artillery pieces and hundreds of vehicles. Number Nine: South of the Pripyat Marshes, the German army fought fiercely with the elite of the Red Army, persevering and bravely defeating the enemy, occupying the fortress west of Kovel, and is now advancing towards Kovel. In the north, the German tank corps advanced eastward, directly approaching Lusk. The German air force made significant contributions. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and lost many tanks. In the battles around Dubno alone, the enemy lost 200 tanks and many artillery pieces, including 42 of the largest caliber.

Number Ten: Two large Soviet army units were surrounded by the German army east of Bialystok. Although the Soviet army repeatedly attempted to break out of the encirclement, it ultimately failed. The encircling German army became increasingly tight. Within a few days, the Soviet army will either surrender or be annihilated. In any case, the Soviet army attempting to break through the German center is at a loss and cannot escape its fate.

Number Eleven: Our armored forces and mechanized units have bypassed Bialystok and reached the vicinity of Minsk. Great victories are to be expected.

Haitong News Agency, 29th, Berlin: From the 22nd to the 27th of this month, the German army captured 40,000 Soviet soldiers, 600 artillery pieces, and 2,233 armored vehicles, including 46 heavy tanks, each weighing 52 tons. In addition, countless anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, rifles, and motorcycles were captured. The Red Air Force lost a total of 4,107 aircraft. German aircraft lost only 150 aircraft during the same period.

### The Soviet-German War Has Begun. It Will Be Difficult to End in the Short Term. The Red Army Will Do Its Utmost to Defend Leningrad and Give the Aggressors a Painful Lesson.

TASS, 28th, Moscow: The Pravda editorial, headlined "Victory Must Be Achieved, Victory Must Belong to Us," stated, "The national patriotic sentiment is boiling, and everyone has an unwavering determination to destroy the Fascist bandits. The narrow-minded and arrogant German Fascists have failed to understand the strength they have aroused, but they will realize it later. The Red Army is fighting valiantly and courageously at the front. Although the war has only just begun, the era of the petty German imitators of Napoleon's worthless achievements and false victories is over. They will soon be punished for their crimes and evil deeds. Our whole country is calm and confident that we will achieve victory. Although our country has been attacked by treacherous Fascists, we will never flinch and will continue our mission. We must redouble our efforts, increase production, and provide all assistance to our Red Army and Navy. We know that victory will not come on its own but must be won through resolute and bloody battles. Our country knows the price of sacrifice. We understand the difficulties, but we will overcome them. Lenin and Stalin's instructions to all people are to overcome difficulties. The war has begun and cannot be ended in the short term. We must not be flustered or discouraged by temporary achievements and victories. This war, involving millions of people, is a difficult historical struggle, but one thing we know for sure is that victory will belong to us. We will win because the war we are engaged in is a sacred war for the motherland. Our Red Army is full of strength, we have inexhaustible support, and our people and the Stalin government are determined. We must grit our teeth, work hard, and strive for victory until the world's public enemy, German Fascism, is crushed."

TASS, 28th, Moscow: Finnish President Ryti, in his broadcast address, repeated Hitler's claim that "in November 1940, the Soviets asked Germany to allow the Soviet Union to settle and end matters with Finland." Regarding this matter, Pravda commented, "The purpose of this rumor is to deceive and incite the Finnish people against the Soviet Union and to cover up the crimes of the 'Ryti Company' against the Finnish people. The Finnish rulers have violated the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Finland in 1940. They have secretly allied themselves with the German Fascists and turned their country into a base for attacking the Soviet Union, allowing the German Fascists to use it. Under the guidance of German officers, Finland has rapidly fortified its borders, and the German Fascists have even openly gathered 'volunteers' in Finland. Germany and Finland have conducted joint demonstrations on the border. The Soviet Union has tolerated the provocations of the Finnish Fascist government for a long time. It is time for us to teach them a lesson. The Finnish warlords and German mercenaries must already know the painful lessons that the enemies who invaded the Soviet border and Leningrad once encountered. This lesson that we will give to Hitler's lackeys will be a hundred times greater than before. After this decisive lesson, they will never recover. The Red Army will do its utmost to guarantee the safety of Leningrad."

Reuters, 29th, Lisbon: A military commentator for the Lisbon newspaper Voz stated that the Soviet Union, with its strong struggle, should be able to stop the attacking army for as long as three months, at which time the allied countries should be able to come and assist. Britain now certainly has some time to rest, it is said.

### Hitler Plans to Establish a Russian State with a King, People, and Land Designated

Reuters, 29th, Moscow: The well-known Soviet commentator Chavilavsky stated that Hitler intends to have the son of the former Russian crown prince or the youngest brother of Princess Kira as the Russian king. According to the German plan, the Russian state that Germany is preparing to establish will have a population of 60 million, and its territory will include the Moscow province, Ukraine, the Baltic provinces, the Caucasus, Bessarabia, and Poland. As for the Leningrad province, including the city of Leningrad, it has already been given to Finland by Hitler. Hitler does not pay attention to the other parts of the Soviet Union, it is said.

### Rumor: Stalin Arrives in Ukraine to Command Operations Against Germany

### The National Emergency Declared by the United States Will Be Requested to Be Expressed Similarly by Congress So That the President Can Obtain Freedom of Action in the Capacity of Commander-in-Chief and Have the Power to Send Troops to Locations Outside the Western Hemisphere

Reuters, 29th, Washington: According to reliable sources yesterday, the U.S. authorities have decided to request that Congress formally declare the existence of a national emergency so that President Roosevelt, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief, can have a free hand in national defense actions. The War Department advocates making this declaration so that those undergoing selective service training, national guardsmen, and reserve officers can be retained on active duty indefinitely. Officials believe that although the President has already declared a national emergency, without the consent of Congress, if Congress also declares a national emergency, it can remove the restrictions on the President's powers. The President would be able to send troops to locations outside the Western Hemisphere and grant the President other powers.

### U.S. Government Aid to China Includes Establishing Aircraft Factories in China

United Press, 29th, Washington: News yesterday indicated that the U.S. government's aid to China includes consideration of building new airfields and aircraft manufacturing plants in strategically defended areas within China. It is understood that more than one hundred American military pilots have resigned from their positions in the U.S. Army Air Corps in order to serve in China. The government's aid to China approves of such resignations. Haitong News Agency, 29th, Chongqing: According to information received here indirectly, many American pilots and engineers have arrived in Kunming. According to well-informed sources, they will arrive in Chongqing in the near future.

### U.S. Senate Continues to Authorize the Treasury Department to Manage the Sino-U.S. Stabilization Fund

United Press, 29th, Washington: The Senate yesterday passed a bill extending the President's power to devalue the dollar for two years. At the same time, the Treasury Department's authority to maintain a $2,000,000,000 stabilization fund was also extended for two years. The bill was passed by a vote of 40 to 20 and was immediately sent to the White House for signing. After the passage of this bill, the Treasury Department will be able to continue its power to implement the Sino-U.S. exchange stabilization fund method. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau once believed that this method was one of the reasons why Congress should pass it.

### Welles Declares to the Press That There Is No Intention to Send a Representative to the Soviet Union

Havas, 28th, Washington: Under Secretary of State Welles told the press today that the United States has no intention of sending a military delegation to the Soviet Union at this time. Today, I met with British Ambassador Lord Halifax, but I am unable to disclose what was discussed at this time.

### U.S. Senator Pepper Calls for Maximum Aid to Britain and the Soviet Union

United Press, 29th, Washington: Senator Pepper of Florida, in a national radio address last night, said that the United States should assist the Soviet Union, Britain, and all countries resisting Hitler's aggression with every plane, every cannon, and every tank so as to defeat Hitler before he reaches the United States. Pepper said, "If we look at a map on a flat surface, the Soviet Union is separated from our country by a vast Atlantic Ocean, but if we look at the globe on a round surface, the Soviet Union is west of the Bering Strait, only a few miles from the United States. From the U.S. territory of Alaska, one can see the Soviet border across the sea." (Editor's note: On both sides of the Bering Strait, the borders of the U.S. and the Soviet Union are only thirty miles apart at their narrowest point, and the two islands are only one and a half miles apart, which is of great importance to U.S. national defense.)

### U.S. House Military Committee Criticizes Inadequate National Defense Measures

Reuters, 29th, Washington: The House Military Committee last night released a report on its weeks-long study of national defense progress. It made many criticisms of defense, saying that the United States lacked important raw materials, leading to various major oversights and delays. These shortcomings are mostly due to the lack of responsible leaders with authority and the fact that the country has focused on social reform in recent years while neglecting national security. Government officials should have a long-term vision. The authorities only establish special departments to deal with difficult problems when they arise, which only increases the confusion of decentralized powers. The most lacking important raw materials are steel and rubber.

### The Capital Speculates That Japan May Attack the Soviet Union. Germany Is Forcibly Urging Japan to Join the War. Japan Is Also Thinking of Taking This Opportunity to Advance North.

Havas, 28th, Chongqing: Observers here generally believe that Japan will continue to take a wait-and-see attitude towards the German-Soviet war, taking Germany's firm grasp of victory as the key to its fulfillment of the obligations of the Tripartite Pact and the Anti-Comintern Pact. However, some people have gradually decided to revise their opinions and assert that Japan will soon attack the Soviet Union in order to gain Germany's favor and realize its long-cherished desire to annex the area east of Lake Baikal. Their arguments are: (1) Germany is urging them very hard; (2) the active activities of pro-Axis and anti-American factions in Japan; (3) Japan has lost the opportunity to advance south and cannot let go of the opportunity to advance north again; (4) Japan needs Germany's military technology assistance and some sophisticated components and must recognize the need to open up the Eurasian land route. They also believe that when Japan implements an attack on the Soviet Union, Matsuoka will inevitably step down. According to military estimates, Japan's total military strength is 57 divisions, of which 10 divisions are stationed in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Manchuria, and at least 15 divisions are stationed in the occupied areas of North China and some areas along the coast of China. Therefore, the number that can be transferred is about 30 divisions. According to this calculation, in terms of numbers, the Japanese army is slightly superior to the Soviet Far East Army. However, in terms of equipment, the Soviet army is not weak and has solid defensive fortifications to use. Therefore, it is not easy for Japan to quickly achieve victory over the Soviet Union. In addition, once Japan launches an attack, British and Soviet military cooperation will inevitably be strengthened, and the United States will also adopt more active steps against Japan in order to contain it. At the same time, China's counterattack will be a matter of course. Therefore, Japan's attack on the Soviet Union will result in an early settlement in the Far East. In other words, China's final victory can be brought forward, it is said.

The Japanese Newspaper Fantasizes About the Soviet Union Again

United Press, 29th, Tokyo: The "Kokumin Shimbun" today demanded that the government make a clear definition of the geographical area of Japan's co-prosperity sphere, because the possible expansion of Axis hegemony in the Asian part of the Soviet Union will cause Japan to encounter "serious problems." The "Kokumin Shimbun" pointed out that the two "new orders" recognized by the Tripartite Pact lack definite boundaries and said that Germany's war against the Soviet Union must be based on the belief that the Soviet Union should be placed under Axis power. The newspaper said, "If the Axis area should include the Soviet Union, the Near East, and Africa, why do Germany and Italy not recognize Japan's power in India, Australia, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, and in the area east of the Soviet Urals?"

### British Deputy Ambassador to the United States Delivers a Speech Saying That to Achieve Early Victory, We Must Strive for Production

Reuters, 29th, Atlantic City: The new British Deputy Ambassador to the United States, Campbell, said in a speech to the Maryland Bar Association last night, "When we have an unlimited supply of military supplies and can completely control the skies and the land, we can be closer to victory by another year. According to the current plan, the autumn of 1942 will be the period when the production of various supplies gradually reaches its highest level. Therefore, the belief that 1943 will see Germany take a defensive posture is not false optimism. The production competition between the United States and the Nazis has now begun, so democracies must redouble their efforts and strive for speed, working together to produce ships, aircraft, food, shells, and oil and iron," it is said.

### U.S. Aircraft Production Will Be Temporarily Reduced

United Press, 27th, Washington: Defense officials said yesterday that they expect aircraft manufacturing production to decline in the next three days due to a lack of manufacturing materials and machinery, and pointed out that the decline in production began in May, when aircraft production was only 1,334, 57 fewer than in April. This reduction in production will continue until August, as the millions of dollars used for production technology will take effect after August. However, the government has taken several remedial steps to address this production decline: (1) finding ways to reduce automobile manufacturing; (2) the Production Management Department is urging the government's eight aluminum plants to produce 600 million pounds of aluminum annually; (3) prioritizing aircraft for Britain, as the United States will be able to let Britain have 32 percent of its first-line aircraft by mid-August.

### U.S. Maritime Commission Allocates Foreign Ships to Sail on New Routes

### Peru Strengthens Its Neutral Position

United Press, 29th, Capital of Peru: The Peruvian authorities have taken various measures to strengthen their neutral position in the current situation in Europe. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the diplomatic envoys of various countries today that any propaganda that is favorable to one side of the belligerents is in conflict with international law and the resolutions passed by the 1938 Pan-American Conference. Our country cannot ignore this, it is said.

### Lack of Oil Is Germany's Weakness, Observes British Minister for Economic Warfare

Reuters, 29th, London: British Minister for Economic Warfare Dalton said yesterday that oil is Hitler's economic weakness, and Hitler is not happy about the future supply of this commodity. The Nazis' recent actions in the Baltic Sea, the Near East, and the Soviet Union are for this reason. Once the oil supply falls below a certain figure, Germany will not be able to continue fighting. He was pleased to hear the news that the oil port of Constanța had been bombed and caught fire, as the port contained a large amount of oil that had been blockaded by the British and that Germany had been unable to transport out. Germany is currently launching an offensive on a 1,000-mile front in the Soviet Union, consuming a huge amount of gasoline, it is said.

### Nazis Hold Anti-Communist Demonstrations in the Netherlands

Reuters, 29th, Amsterdam: The German Social Democratic Party held anti-communist demonstrations in and around this city, with more than 30,000 residents participating. The German official in charge of the Netherlands, Enquirt, claimed that this action should be regarded as the starting point of the Dutch Nazi organization. It is heard that many communists have been arrested in the past few days. It is noted that before May 10, 1940, one-sixth of the residents of Amsterdam voted and identified themselves as leaning towards the Communist Party.

### The Anti-Comintern Pact Expires This Autumn

Reuters, 29th, London: Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact on November 25, 1936, with a term of five years. Therefore, according to the opinion of qualified observers here, the pact will inevitably expire this autumn. The pact states that all signatory countries agree to notify each other of the activities of the Third International and take strict measures to resist communist propaganda and establish a permanent committee to promote this goal. According to German official news agencies, political circles in Berlin currently do not want to discuss any possibility of extending the pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is said.

### Italian Aircraft Attack Malta, Many Destroyed

Reuters, 29th, London: A recent communiqué from the British Air Force in the Middle East stated that when Italian aircraft attacked Malta on Friday, six Italian fighter aircraft and one bomber were shot down. Other fighter aircraft were also damaged. In Cyrenaica, three enemy aircraft caught fire and crashed to the ground. Yesterday, British aircraft also attacked Benghazi, causing heavy damage. It is now known that when British aircraft flew over the strait to the skies over northern France yesterday morning, they shot down two German aircraft. Therefore, a total of five German aircraft were destroyed yesterday, two of which were shot down by a Polish pilot.

### British Troops at Tobruk Still Hold Firm, Sheltering in Trenches Left by Italians, Bombarding German Troops with Fierce Artillery Fire

United Press, Tobruk, 27th (Delayed) – Tobruk has been under siege by German forces, with heavy artillery fire, for three months. The isolated British troops not only hold firm but also frequently launch fierce attacks on the besieging forces. A reporter accompanying a British warship sailed into the besieged city, witnessing the extraordinary hardship of the soldiers and the impregnable nature of the defenses. The warship navigated through a path cleared in a minefield laid by German aircraft and successfully reached the port. In the pitch-black sky, red and white artillery fire flashed incessantly. The British troops retaliated fiercely, returning fire with two shells for every German shell. The battleground, spanning twenty-five miles, is located in a desolate desert bordering the blue sea. The tactics employed are similar to those used in the old-fashioned warfare of twenty-five years ago, with troops peering at each other through periscopes in trenches. The difference is that the sturdy trenches of Tobruk are built of pure cement and are a legacy of the Italian army. The German troops several miles away do not have this advantage, their earthen trenches being very simple. The trenches are separated by barbed wire. The British artillery fire is very accurate. Beyond the battlefield, the wreckage of Nazi tanks is scattered, destroyed during the attacks in April, mostly half-buried in the sand. The British troops are exceptionally brave and resolute. Even the large formations of German dive bombers cannot overcome them. It is not entirely accurate to say that Tobruk is besieged, as supplies, except for cigarettes and beer, continue to arrive. However, the Italians left behind a countless number of square-shaped cigars, so the Australian soldiers have all switched to smoking cigars. The Italians also left behind a large quantity of chutney, syrup, flour, and yeast, so the Australian soldiers are all learning to bake for themselves.

### British Forces in Syria Continue to Make Progress

Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th – According to a military spokesman here, the British and Free French forces, in the third week of their offensive into Syria, have encountered some resistance from Vichy forces, so progress toward Beirut is not rapid. However, the Allied forces have captured the key town of Nebek, 35 miles northeast of Damascus, which lies midway between Damascus and Homs. Homs is a key point on the railway to Tripoli and Aleppo. Fierce fighting is still taking place along the Ma'chai mountain range, 15 miles northwest of Damascus, with both sides seeking to seize the strategic mountain ridges.

United Press, Cairo, 29th – Last night, an army official stated that British and Free French forces had broken through the French lines yesterday, capturing Yabiel, 15 miles north of Damascus. It is reported that fighting is still ongoing. At the same time, large numbers of Vichy troops are concentrated behind the Turkish and Iraqi borders. British troops advancing toward Homs have not yet encountered fierce resistance.

### German-Soviet War Alters World Situation, China Becomes More United Internally, Soviet Union Joins Anti-Aggression Front, Friction Between the Kuomintang and the Communists Can Be Eliminated, Zhou Enlai Advocates Attacking Japan

Chongqing – Germany's attack on the Soviet Union not only clarifies the international situation but also places China's closest friend on the active anti-aggression front. It also offers hope for easing domestic political tensions in China. Leaders of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party believe that the new front can eliminate friction between the Kuomintang and the Communists and encourage closer and more wholehearted cooperation. The Communist Party's support for Moscow, its hostility toward Britain and the United States, and its subsequent signing of a neutrality pact with Japan have all contributed to the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States' immediate assistance to the Soviet Union, and Japan's growing doubt about the value of the Japanese-Soviet pact have eliminated most of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists. The reason is that Kuomintang leaders often say that the Chinese Communist Party is more loyal to Moscow than to the Chinese government. However, due to the Soviet Union's new international status, the Chinese Communist Party will be more willing to cooperate with the Chinese government. In other words, the Soviet Union's joining the Chinese-British-American front will inevitably lead to the Chinese Communist Party joining as well. The Chinese Communist Party initially suspected that Britain might unite with Hitler to wage an anti-Bolshevik war, but they seem to have been reassured by Britain and the United States' guarantees of assistance to the Soviet Union. In addition, both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have expressed their willingness to disregard the past and show closer understanding. The Ta Kung Pao recently commented that it was pleased to receive formal news of the Eighteenth Group Army cooperating with the central army in Pu. On the day the German army began its attack on the Soviet Union, Zhou Enlai, the Communist Party's representative in Chongqing, published an article in the Communist Party's daily newspaper, seeking peace with the Kuomintang. Zhou's article stated, "In war, China must have a center to maintain the whole country. In the past four years, this center has been Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, the National Government, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the Kuomintang. When this center can lead the country to continue the war, everyone should support it. We, the Communist Party, recognize and support this center and this leader." Zhou also stated that the Communist Party recognizes and praises the Kuomintang's internal progress and development, which are essential elements for victory. Zhou said that the Communist Party's opposition to the Kuomintang is only against the stubborn elements within it. Zhou also denied that the Communist Party wants to establish its own center and overthrow the Kuomintang. In addition to this good phenomenon, it is generally acknowledged that China's comrades in the British-American front all hope that there will not be an open split within China. Due to the current situation, it seems that there is a trend to fully meet this hope. (United Press, 29th)

Chongqing – Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the Communist Party in Chongqing, called on the whole country today to launch a general counter-offensive against Japan when Japan begins its northward attack on the Soviet Union. Zhou urged the country to prepare greater military strength, improve military equipment and political systems, and overcome economic difficulties in preparation for a final blow to Japan in an article published in the Xinhua Daily. Zhou said that Japan is very likely to wage war against the Soviet Union, and Tokyo's hesitation is due to the following four reasons: (1) If Japan advances north, the China Incident cannot be resolved; (2) Siberia's resources are not as rich as those of the Dutch East Indies; (3) If the northward advance cannot be decided quickly, Japan's feet will be deeply mired in the snow; (4) Britain and the United States may attack Japan if it advances north. Zhou refuted the report by the Shanghai Havas Agency that the Chinese Communist Party relies on Soviet aid to survive. He said that Soviet aid is given to the whole of China and to the National Government, not to the Communist Party. (United Press, 29th)

### Japanese Aircraft Attacked Chongqing Twice Yesterday, British Embassy Bombed, Counselor, Secretary, and Two Others Injured, Chinese Anti-Aircraft Guns Fiercely Fired

Chongqing – Britain lodged a protest with Japan about the previous Japanese bombing of the British Embassy in Chongqing, but has not received a reply from Japan. This afternoon, another large bomb fell from a Japanese aircraft, hitting the already heavily damaged British Embassy building and destroying it completely. Four embassy staff members were injured, including Sir Charles Blacker, a Chinese counselor, Alan, a third secretary, Mrs. Alan, and Mr. Borgona. Sir Charles had part of his right ear blown off, and a deep wound on his jaw. The other three had minor injuries. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British ambassador, was not in the building at the time of the bombing and was not injured. An International News Service reporter interviewed the supervisor of the Chongqing Central Hospital, who said that Sir Charles Blacker would require surgery but his injuries were not serious. Sir Charles was immediately operated on after being sent to the hospital, but the operation had to be interrupted because a second wave of Japanese aircraft arrived. The French Embassy, adjacent to the British Embassy, was spared from disaster, although it was severely shaken. More civilians were killed and injured throughout the day. Five people were killed and thirty injured in the embassy area. (International News Service, 29th)

### Condolences to the British Ambassador

Chongqing – Fifty-four Japanese aircraft bombed Consulate Alley (where the British Embassy is located) in Chongqing city today. Three staff members of the British Embassy and the wife of one staff member were also injured. Two of the main buildings of the embassy were also damaged by bombs. The hospital of the British Methodist Church was also directly hit by a bomb, and the hospital was severely damaged and temporarily cannot function. It is reported that there were no casualties inside the hospital. The residence of Sir Charles Blacker, a counselor at the British Embassy, was directly hit by a bomb. Sir Charles's jaw was shattered. Sir Charles and embassy staff members were taking shelter in an air-raid shelter when shrapnel flew into the shelter. Sir Charles's ear was cut. Alan, a third secretary at the British Embassy, was slightly injured, and his wife was also injured in the face. In addition, Secretary Borgona was also injured in the hand. Two Chinese employees of the British Embassy were killed at the entrance to the air-raid shelter, and eleven other Chinese employees were also injured. Sir Charles Blacker's residence was hit by a bomb at 11:20 a.m. Blacker was also taken to a nearby hospital for treatment, but when the second wave of aircraft arrived at 1:20 p.m., Blacker was taken back to the embassy's air-raid shelter, thus delaying treatment. According to his Chinese surgeon, who is a close attendant, Blacker's injuries are not serious, but he may require surgery. Blacker is now in the hospital, while Alan and his wife and Borgona have been discharged from the hospital after treatment. In addition to the direct hit and destruction of Charles Blacker's residence, another large bomb landed in the kitchen of the main building where the ambassador's office is located. The house has not collapsed, but its interior is almost completely destroyed. A large unexploded bomb landed on the lawn fifteen feet in front of the house. The small buildings of the consulate were only slightly damaged. Diplomatic circles have announced that former Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui and new Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi have sent words of condolence to the British Ambassador Archibald Clark Kerr. It is understood that the British Ambassador intends to report today's attack to London. The four Britons were injured because they were standing near the entrance to the air-raid shelter, and fragments of the building flew into the entrance. Sir Charles Blacker was transferred to the west of the so-called safe area on the south bank of the Yangtze River this afternoon. More than a dozen bombs also fell there. It is reported that a small village there was bombed, killing more than twenty people. The house of the American clergyman Macaude was also slightly damaged. Macaude himself left this morning to return home on vacation, but his wife and daughter remained in Chongqing. (United Press, 29th)

Japanese Aircraft Attack Guangdong

Sihui, Guangdong – Maoming, the military and political center of southern Guangdong, is located in a remote area and has always been an undefended city. Japanese aircraft bombed it in March, June, and September of the 28th year of the Republic. On the 24th of this month, nine Japanese aircraft took off from Hainan Island, flew over Shuidong, and swooped down on Maocheng, dropping multiple explosive and incendiary bombs on the city.

However, the newspapers did not comment on it. The Army's newspaper, Saodang Bao, published a headline in four lines saying "Sino-American Cooperation is More United." The Central Daily News commented on why Japan has not yet advanced south, pointing out that the main reason is that most of Japan's fighting forces are being held back by China. The newspaper also said that for the same reason, Japan will be forced to abandon any plans to attack the Soviet Union because Japan's fighting forces are stuck in China. (United Press, 29th)

### Rebuilding the Chinese Air Force is Underway Actively, Goal is to Raise Funds to Purchase 2,000 Aircraft, One Yuan Movement Starts on July 7th

Chongqing – The movement to rebuild the Chinese Air Force seems to have been very quiet recently, but it is actually still in full swing. According to those in charge of the Aviation Association, the goal of rebuilding the air force is 2,000 aircraft. If all sectors at home and abroad work together, it should not be difficult to achieve this goal. It is now scheduled to start a one-yuan movement on July 7th. Given the current high cost of living, it is by no means difficult for people to contribute one yuan. Therefore, domestically, the authorities of various provinces and military departments will lead, with counties, townships, towns, and pao-chia as the backbone, in order to strive for universal application. Overseas, Chen Qingyun will go to preside over it, in order to achieve the goal quickly. According to Chen, he received donations of 5.56 million US dollars when he went to the United States. This decision to go to Southeast Asia, the results must not be weak. Domestically, Sichuan Province has already had a movement to donate 100 aircraft, and Hechuan County has already donated three aircraft alone. Hunan Province is working hard to promote the movement of one aircraft per county. (Havas, 28th)

### European War Musings (65): The Reality of Britain's Arduous Struggle

However, we must not underestimate the German Air Force. Even with the assistance of the United States, the new British Air Force must still exert its full strength to cope with future German offensives. As for the most pressing need of the British Army, it is tanks, and more tanks. Many commanders I have encountered in recent months are eagerly hoping that the rate at which factories manufacture tanks can keep pace with the training of personnel.

One day, I obtained permission from the authorities to witness the new tank manufacturing program that is currently progressing. The speed at which tanks are manufactured in secret factories is far greater than in the past. After production, they are sent to the ordnance depot and then distributed to various battalions for the defense of the British Isles or for use overseas.

Although the allocation of these tanks is currently focused on defending the homeland, a group of army generals certainly hopes that they can be used overseas soon. The elite troops defending the homeland all acknowledge that they can only fulfill their mission of defending the homeland when the time is ripe for Britain to send troops to the European continent to launch a large-scale offensive.

Of course, it is forbidden to publish information regarding the number of tanks manufactured or other details that could provide clues. However, if we understand the complexity of this tank mechanism, we can easily understand the significant difficulties in accelerating its manufacture.

Take the patrol tank as an example. Its appearance is simpler than an ordinary steamroller, but it actually contains 6,200 different parts, with more than 50,000 different mechanical and matching functions. The cost of this type of tank is approximately £1,000 per ton, which is even more expensive than a bomber. Moreover, the engineering involved in manufacturing tanks is extremely precise, with some parts requiring precision to one ten-thousandth of an inch.

In one factory, the reporter saw as many as 500 different types of manufacturing machines, all powered by electricity. A single piece of steel plate can ultimately be made into a complete tank, driving automatically and ready for road or cross-country testing.

If you have never seen a tank, you cannot imagine its agile movement, balanced stability, and flexibility. A heavy tank weighs up to 15 tons and can crash through houses, crawling over rough terrain with exceptional comfort. They can turn around in three seconds, as agile as polo horses, and are actually faster than ordinary cars.

Although machinery as precise as tanks is not suitable for mass production, factories are still working hard on designs to ensure the simultaneous construction of the maximum number of tanks. The reporter saw its assembly mechanism, which was spacious enough to allow a complete tank to be lifted by a 20-ton crane onto another tank.

In the tank manufacturing factories, in addition to men, women are also employed. The machines used come from various countries, even including those purchased from Germany. The reporter saw brand names such as Hamburg, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Montreuil on the machines.

Accompanying me on the inspection were two British officers from Egypt. They both said that the army recognizes the skills of the craftsmen, and General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East, recently stated in a telegram that although many Italian tanks are the latest models, they are no match for British tanks. British desert patrols have traveled no less than 500,000 miles, but not a single tank has been lost due to mechanical failure.

The reporter asked an officer how British tanks compared to German tanks. Based on his experience in the battle of Flanders before the fall of France and Belgium, he replied: "We rarely have the opportunity to judge their merits, but in every battle, British tanks seem to fully fulfill their duties."

This experience, of course, cannot be taken as conclusive, because at that time, Britain only had one armored division fighting in France and never had a chance to prove itself except for defense. After the retreat from Dunkirk, Britain did not even have an armored division left. Those tanks, like other vehicles and artillery, were completely lost in France.

In contrast, the German army had countless tanks, often pushing forward with about 100 tanks simultaneously on a 1,500-yard-wide front. The German army has always had a numerical advantage in tanks, especially light tanks. The British army no longer attaches importance to light tanks, and after the Dunkirk campaign, the German army must have learned a lesson from the heavy tanks used by the British army.

Moreover, Britain today is not only at war, but also undergoing a revolution.

When, where, and how this war will be won remains unknown, but one fact is already clear: the Britain of today is different from the Britain of two years ago, and the Britain after the war will undergo even more drastic changes.

What will Britain become?

In the United States, many questions are often heard: What kind of country are we helping? To what extent has Britain changed now, and what will it become after the war? Will it become socialist? Is there a danger of national socialism?"

In order to obtain answers to these many questions, the reporter has traveled throughout Britain and talked with farmers, workers, Labor Party leaders, Conservatives, Liberals, two Labor Party representatives in the cabinet, social service workers, women's leaders, and other various people.

After extensive investigation, the reporter believes without a doubt that Britain is in the midst of a revolution. But this is a standard British-style revolution, not radical, not extreme, and not sudden, and the people are not even aware of it. However, this revolution has profound significance, not only economically but also socially, and not only socially but also politically, and is not only a temporary effect of the war but actually has permanent qualities.

This revolution has brought about fundamental changes in British society, but it does not contradict tradition, which is a standard British characteristic. This revolution has overturned several long-established special positions, but this transformation is gradual and gentle, and it is still a special British-style revolution.

In social terms, the major reform brewing is an equalizing effect. It would be incorrect to say that the British class system has been abolished. The class system has not been abolished and will not be abolished, at least not in this generation. However, class discrimination has clearly decreased. The class system is very likely to coexist with the war and post-war reforms, but there will undoubtedly be many changes.

In this war, people of all classes are equally sweating and bleeding, which is a major reason, and bombing is the biggest driving force for equalization.

The other day, I had dinner with a noble lady and learned that she sleeps in the basement almost every night. This basement was originally the servants' dining room. Her maid sleeps on a bed close to her. The servants' living room in the basement is occupied by two elderly couples who escaped from the Dunkirk area. The hostess has been getting along with them for several months, and their affection has increased day by day. Before going to bed every night, she must give them a warm hug.

Furthermore, the air raid patrol and the home guard have also greatly increased the idea of equal danger and equal service.

In the home guard, it is common for former officers and gardeners, drivers, and servants to be in the same ranks. Gentlemen and workers often stand together all night, acting as watchmen against paratroopers. Sometimes, plumbers and bankers are also assigned to patrol the same street.

Examples of the complete elimination of "class consciousness" in the sound of bombing are too numerous to mention. There is no doubt that a new friendship, a new fraternity, and enthusiasm have emerged in Britain today. These new products are the most powerful and far-reaching elements of this social revolution.

Economic factors have also accelerated the process of equalization. The war-time taxes on the rich and middle class are the heaviest. Income tax starts at 40 percent, and those with meager incomes can be reduced to 25 percent or less.

But for those with high incomes, the surtax has skyrocketed to 90 percent. In addition, there is an excessive profits tax, which is a severe measure to crack down on hoarding and profiteering. After its implementation, the annual profits of any large company or enterprise cannot exceed the situation in 1937 or 1938.

Britain's methods of cracking down on war profiteering are very strict. After careful investigation by the reporter, it is said that although manufacturers who sign contracts with the government can circumvent the regulations and obtain more profits than before the war, it is generally impossible to profit from the national crisis in Britain.

### French Municipal Council's Affordable Rice: Citywide Sale Next Month, Managed by Various Foreign Firms but Subject to Control, First Batch of Public Warehouse Rice Expected to Arrive in Port Day After Tomorrow

Rice Shops Selling Short Weight, the Guild Has Thoroughly Investigated

The first batch of 27,150 bags of Yangon small-grain rice, handled by the Food Rice Public Warehouse organized by Yu Qiaqing and others, has been loaded onto the "Gray" ship and is coming to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in port on the afternoon of the day after tomorrow (2nd). According to an employee of the Dafoe foreign firm in charge, a total of 80,000 bags of this small-grain rice were ordered at the end of March. Due to delays in the ship schedule, the shipment has been delayed until now. Recently, the firm received a telegram from Yangon stating that the remaining 52,850 bags will be shipped to Shanghai for supply as soon as possible, and the shipment date is set before July 15th.

Retail Rice Shops: Selling Both Types

According to sources in the foreign firm community, since the French Municipal Council's discounted Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 mixed broken rice, managed by 14 foreign firms of the Import Committee, has been sold, the total quantity sold is about 100,000 bags. The 10,000 bags distributed by the Shenji Foreign Firm arrived in Shanghai on the 24th of this month. The 4,500 bags distributed by the Dafoe Foreign Firm are also expected to arrive in port on the 4th of next month. Because the Saigon broken rice is a June futures contract, other foreign firms, such as Heyi, Fujia, and Jinfat, have already shipped their distributed rice from Saigon before the end of this month. According to sources from the Import Committee, in the middle of next month, retail rice shops throughout the city, in addition to selling discounted small-grain rice, can also sell discounted Saigon rice.

Only Half Sold Despite First Batch Arriving in Full

As of the "Yusheng" ship, which arrived in port on the 28th, a total of 120,000 bags of discounted small-grain rice arrived this month. Together with the more than 161,000 bags shipped last month, there were a total of more than 280,000 bags. The first batch of foreign rice ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Council from the Hong Kong government has been fully shipped. According to rice industry statistics, only about half of the ordered quantity has been sold so far. This is because most residents in the area have purchased and stored rice in the past, and larger groups and factories also have large amounts of reserves. It is common to store for one or two months. Hoarders who currently hold large amounts of spot goods are hoping to sell them by purchasing from the local firms, which is very difficult. In addition, discounted foreign rice is constantly pouring in, and rice prices continue to fall. Speculators who hoarded in the past will soon suffer the consequences.

Dingxingtai Shop Selling Short Weight

According to reports from the Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Association, the Dingxingtai Rice Shop at 134 Hart Road in the Public Concession recently sold one dan of Shanghai Municipal Council foreign rice, which was more than ten catties short of weight. The association has already notified member rice shops to comply with the regulations that the Shanghai Municipal Council foreign rice is sold at 160 catties per dan, and short weight is not allowed by law. The association has dispatched officers to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter.

### Telephone Company Employees to Petition Today

Employees and apprentices of the Electrical Department of the Shanghai Telephone Company on Hart Road previously became panicked due to the reduction in subsidies by the company, and once requested that the director, Mr. Fles, rescind the decision. Due to the lack of results, a dispute arose. It is now learned that the labor side has decided to send representatives to petition again today (30th) and will submit eleven conditions.

### French Ambassador Gaussemont Inspects Marines Yesterday

It is also heard that after the inspection, Mr. Gaussemont led a joint oath to pledge allegiance to the Vichy government.

### New Cargo Ship under the Jurisdiction of the US Shipping Council Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Carrying 10,000 Bags of Wheat Donated by the American Red Cross, Maintaining Shipping by Coming East Monthly Thereafter

The new cargo ship "Flyer", designated by the US Shipping Council to sail the Pacific Far East route, with a deadweight of 6,751 tons, arrived in Shanghai at 7:35 a.m. yesterday from Seattle, USA, under the command of Captain Sturland, carrying 3,000 tons of cargo.

Carrying US Wheat to Relieve Refugees

The ship was also entrusted by the American Red Cross to transport 10,000 bags of US wheat to Shanghai for disaster relief to help refugees in the Shanghai area. One part is said to be designated for allocation to the Association of Jewish Refugees Exiled in Shanghai. According to sources from the Shanghai office of the American Red Cross, medical supplies for disaster relief and relief purposes from the American Red Cross will continue to be shipped in the near future.

Another Ship Expected to Arrive Next Month

Although the ship's name has not been announced, it is learned from the "Xinsheng" newspaper that it is the "Flyer"'s sister ship, the "Arriva". The ship was also built by the US Shipping Council to run to the Far East and is expected to arrive here on July 16th carrying cargo. The ship's deadweight is completely the same as that of the "Flyer".

"Flyer" to Sail to Shanghai Monthly

The "Flyer", which arrived here yesterday morning, was built by the Tacoma Shipyard in Washington and is made entirely of copper. It is 418 feet long, 60 feet wide, has a net deadweight of 3,964 tons, a speed of 14 knots per hour, and a capacity of 8,500 tons. It was built a month ago and handed over to the US Shipping Council for control and dispatch to operate on the Pacific Far East route. The ship is berthed at the Gonghexing Wharf and will come to Shanghai once a month thereafter.

Another Cargo Ship Also Arrived in Port Yesterday

The cargo ship "Langin Bay", represented by the American President Lines, also arrived here yesterday morning, delayed by one day from the original date, carrying 2,000 tons of US cargo. It began unloading on the same day and is scheduled to return to San Francisco via Honolulu in two or three days.

### Western Newspaper Comments on the German-Soviet War, German Troops Encounter Strong Enemy, Soviet Union Not Comparable to France and Other Countries, Powerful Strength Will Surely Have Surprising Actions

The English "Great American Weekly" commented on the "Soviet-German War" yesterday: "The Soviet-German War has reached one week today. Although we are far away from the battlefield and cannot obtain real news, there is one thing that can be believed from the conflicting telegrams from all parties: the Red Army's strong resistance is indeed in progress, forcing the Nazi troops to retreat in some areas. Although the Soviet Union was caught off guard by the speed of this war, they have been able to bravely resist and demand a great price from the Germans. It is an undeniable fact that the German side has achieved some victories so far, but the situation is very different from the past. It is currently impossible to predict whether Germany's encounter in the Soviet Union can be the same as in Norway, the Netherlands, France, Greece, and Yugoslavia. The Nazi state is only now facing an enemy several times stronger than other countries for the first time, and it is the first time it has fought against a proletarian state, and its enemy has been preparing for war for several years. Germany should decide quickly, but its enemy has a vast territory, enough for its army to make strategic retreats when necessary. Germany has many difficulties, such as if the Soviet army retreats into the islands and mountains and continues to resist, the Soviet Union will have to station a large army in the Soviet territory west of that mountain range to control it. This area is almost as large as other parts of Europe, so the German army must station a large army in each railway station, important transportation location, town, and other places. Unless the Soviet Union compromises or the German army is unable to retreat after a major defeat, and the German garrison will certainly find that the Soviet Union is neither France nor the various countries currently occupied by Germany. Because the Soviet Union is a laboring country and there are no new facilities in the country, the German army will feel bored if they stay in the Soviet Union for a long time. In the long process of leisure, it can actually cause a major failure of the German military."

### British Overseas Association Establishes Wartime Group, Work Divided into Three Points

The British Overseas Association of Shanghai held its third special meeting at the racecourse the day before yesterday. Chairman Shankela first elected Johnston as Chairman of the Wartime Group Committee, Anderson as Vice Chairman of the Congress, and Sullivan as the representative of the Canadian Association. Then, Chairman Ke reported on various tasks, divided into three points: first, the work of the Wartime Group Committee; second, the establishment of the League of Democratic Group Countries; third, the economic situation of the association. After the chairman's report, Johnston reported on the achievements of the Wartime Group Committee, and Bode reported on the situation of the Shanghai War Savings Association. Then, the British Consul General George gave a speech, and finally, Mayne reported on the wartime work of British women.

### Refugee Relief Association's Funding is Strained, Actively Repatriating Refugees, Currently Still Housing More Than 13,000 People, Rising Prices, Fewer Donations, Difficult to Maintain

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in view of the reduction in donation income and the increase in living expenses, has been carrying out evacuation work since January of this year. However, due to the high cost of living in the city, the general refugees are deeply afraid that they will not be able to make a living once they leave the facility, so most of them are unwilling to leave. Therefore, the association first evacuated a part of the young and strong refugees. It is estimated that since January, the total number of evacuations has accounted for one-fourth. The total number of refugees currently remaining in the facility has been reduced to more than 13,000, with men accounting for three-tenths and women and children accounting for seven-tenths.

Increasing Repatriation Fees to Encourage Leaving the Facility

In order to encourage refugees to leave the facility, the association has further increased the repatriation fee. It is estimated that the repatriation fee for adults has increased from 22 yuan to 33 yuan per person, and the repatriation fee for children has increased from 17 yuan to 25 yuan per person. However, there are still few people who accept this repatriation fee and leave the facility. This is because most of these people are villagers from the suburbs of the city, their houses have been destroyed, and most of their fields have been used for other purposes, making it impossible for them to return to their hometowns. Moreover, because these people in the facility can solve the problem of food and lodging, and can freely go out to work and peddle, etc., if they are suddenly ordered to leave the facility, their personal income will not be able to maintain the livelihood of their families.

Sharp Decline in Donations, Difficult to Maintain

According to a person from the Relief Association, the refugee living problem has also increased due to the sharp increase in rice and coal prices in the city. It is estimated that the monthly living expenses per person were 9 yuan in national currency in March, but have now increased to 13 yuan. Based on the current number of more than 13,000 refugees, the living expenses will require more than 210,000 yuan in national currency per month. However, donations from all parties are less than in the past, so in addition to making every effort to carry out evacuation work, we also hope that all sectors will generously donate.

Newspaper Advertisement, Monthly Income and Expenses

The total amount of income and expenses of the association in May has been settled yesterday and announced to all sectors in the newspaper. It is estimated that the income is 200,080 yuan and 76 cents in national currency, and the expenditure is 176,397 yuan and 44 cents for living expenses, 4,810 yuan and 05 cents for repatriation fees, and 15,214 yuan and 90 cents for medical expenses.

Xiejih Middle School Graduation Ceremony

Zhejiang Road Xiejih Middle School was founded by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. The more than 200 students are all students who have lost their studies due to the impact of the war. Since its establishment, it has been three years. This year is the graduation period for the junior high school class, so a graduation ceremony will be held at 9:00 a.m. today, and the school's directors Wen Lanting and Huang Hanzhi will be invited to participate. It is heard that the school will add a senior high school class in the next semester.

### Tea Shop Employees Quit, Forming a Strike Situation

The more than 500 tea shops in the city have a total of 1,500 to 600 employees. Due to the impact of soaring prices, their monthly income is not enough to cover their expenses. Therefore, they jointly submitted conditions to the shop owners, requesting improved treatment and increased salaries. Because they were not invited to approve, labor disputes such as work slowdowns occurred. It is learned that the company side held a meeting on the evening of the day before yesterday to discuss solutions, but there has been no practical response to the demands raised by the labor side, so the labor side is very angry and has already left the shop individually, forming a strike situation. It is heard that several employees were arrested yesterday, so the future of the industry's dispute is difficult to predict.

### European Postal Route Schedule

The Shanghai Post Office has now compiled a new postal schedule. Due to the reduction in mail, the Siberian Railway line has been changed to two dispatches per week. One batch will be loaded onto the train on the 30th to transfer to Yuguan to connect with the Middle East Road and the Siberian Railway. The packaging will be done at 8:00 p.m. The Pacific route mail is recently scheduled to be transported by ship from Shanghai on July 4th, and the quantity will increase sharply compared to before. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, several batches of mail that were previously transported from Shanghai to Central Europe via Siberia have been unable to be transported after arriving in Moscow due to the war and are still stranded in the Soviet Union, waiting for the war situation to evolve.

### Today is the End of June, Banking and Financial Industries Conduct Final Accounts, Settlement of Interest with Customers by Various Banks and Firms Has Been Completed, Overall Financial Stability, Various Industries Pass Peacefully

Today is the end of June in the 30th year of the Republic of China. Member banks and firms of the Banking and Financial Industry Association have completed the settlement of interest for commercial and savings accounts one after another. Settlement notices have been issued to various accounts, and the final accounts for the first half of the year will be handled from today. As for industry and commerce, they are also handling the semi-annual settlement. Therefore, the various banks and firms are busy with collection and disbursement, and the amount of note exchange has increased sharply. Starting tomorrow, the banking and financial industries and various industry markets will be closed for two days and will resume business on July 3rd. Regarding the entire Shanghai financial situation, thanks to the efforts of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank to adjust, and the maintenance of the joint reserve of the banking and financial industries, it remains stable as ever, with ample funds and no signs of tension, so various industries can pass this June accounting period peacefully. It is heard that the Member Representative Assembly of the Banking Industry Association for the first half of the year has been decided to be suspended due to this extraordinary period, and the Member Representative Assembly of the Financial Industry Association has also been decided to be suspended. The call rate market for June has been changed to be decided by the Executive Committee.

### Street Scene in the Western Suburbs

In summer, everything on the road seems exceptionally bright compared to usual, especially the most deserted roads in the western suburbs. First, because the sunlight is very strong during the day, and there are a few circles of light, cotton-like white clouds dotting the azure sky, the atmosphere of nature is very clear. Second, the trees planted on both sides of the road have lush green leaves in summer, and the branches and leaves reflect each other, which harmonizes well with the clean streets washed by the rain. If we walk alone on this deserted road, we feel that the surrounding scenery evokes our different emotions, especially when we return home from the bustling city and pass through these quiet places, it feels like another world.

### Organizing Northwest Enterprise Company, Capital of 10 Million Yuan, Yu Qiaqing Initiates with 2.5 Million Yuan Subscription, Aiming to Guide Shanghai and Hong Kong Floating Capital Inward

After Mr. Yu Qiaqing left Shanghai for Hong Kong to investigate resources in the Northwest, he recognized the abundance of resources in the Northwest, such as coal, iron, mineral products, cotton, and wool, all of which are essential commodities for China during wartime.

There is an urgent need for development to meet the country's needs. Therefore, he specially collaborated with the banking and industrial sectors of Shanghai and Hong Kong to initiate the organization of the Northwest Enterprise Company, engaging in the development of the vast resources of the Northwest. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the industrial sector yesterday that after Mr. Yu returned to Hong Kong from his investigation, he immediately invited leaders from the banking and industrial sectors of Shanghai and Hong Kong to a meeting. First, Mr. Yu reported on his findings from the investigation, hoping to mobilize and guide the various banks and industrial sectors in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

Leaders expressed their support and willingness to assist him in completing this great plan as soon as possible. It is heard that the name of the company is tentatively set as "Northwest Enterprise Company," with a capital tentatively set at 10 million national currency. Mr. Yu himself is willing to invest 2.5 million yuan first. As soon as the capital is fully subscribed, an announcement will be made to establish the company.

### Rongwu Sutra Lecture Society Conducts Systematic Lectures

The 18th Sutra Lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Lecture Society was given by Mr. Shen Jueling, who said: Starting from this session, we plan to give systematic lectures that cannot be completed in one session. The topic is "We Confucian scholars should embody Confucius's intention of teaching without discrimination and jointly shoulder the responsibility of harmonizing the five religions." The first section is the history of the five religions.

I previously lectured on Confucius's doctrines without limiting them to Confucianism, not daring to belittle Confucianism. Confucius's personality and teachings far exceeded what the world calls Confucianism, and Confucianism was indeed respected because of Confucius's words in the "Confucian Conduct" chapter of the Book of Rites. Confucianism has had a long relationship with our country's history, and the name of Tao was known earlier than it, and it should not be regarded merely as the Tao of Taoism. Confucius even said in the "Li Ren" chapter of the Analects, "If I hear of the Tao in the morning, I can die content in the evening." The "Doctrine of the Mean" in the Book of Rites says, "What Heaven imparts to man is called nature. To follow our nature is called the Tao. The cultivation of the Tao is called instruction. The Tao is that from which we may not stray for an instant. If we can stray from it, it cannot be the Tao." From this, we know that all who speak of instruction cannot stray from the Tao. If we stray from the Tao, it is not instruction. How can the word Tao be monopolized by Taoists? Is it not what the five religions share?

The oldest books of what are now called Taoism are Lao Tzu and Zhuang Tzu. Only the seven inner chapters and the "Tianxia" chapter of Zhuang Tzu can be credibly considered not forgeries; the remaining chapters contain many forgeries. Sima Qian and his son, his father Tan placed Tao before Confucianism, and Qian placed Confucianism before Taoism. This was because during the Western Han Dynasty, Emperor Wen and Emperor Jing revered Huang-Lao, and Emperor Wu honored Confucianism. The atmosphere of the era changed accordingly, and the Sima family's scholarship could not help but be influenced by it. Qian's reverence for Confucius as the supreme sage was truly a unique insight of ancient and modern times.

Buddhism entered China during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Eastern Han Dynasty, according to the Zizhi Tongjian, in the eighth year of Emperor Ming's Yongping reign. The "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" in the Book of Wei says, "When Sakyamuni was born, it was in the ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou, the seventh year of Duke Zhuang of Lu in the Spring and Autumn period, when a constant star was not seen on a bright night." Taoism originated from Lao Tzu. The "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" also records, "In the eighth year of Taichang, on the day of Wuxu in the tenth month, the Master of Pasturing Earth, Li Puwen, came to Mount Song, claiming to be the great-grandson of Lao Tzu. He used to live in Sangqian in the Dai Commandery. During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, he attained the Tao and became the Lord of the Pasturing Earth Palace. He also said that between the two poles there are thirty-six heavens, with thirty palaces in them, each with a lord, the highest being the Ultimate Supreme, deciding on the Great True Venerable to decide on the covering of the heavens and the carrying of the earth! Yin and Yang True Venerable, deciding on the Hongzheng True Venerable." The propagation of the two religions was so miraculous. Today, the Yungang Grottoes west of Datong County, Shanxi Province, are stacked like buildings, with large and small Buddha statues densely distributed in layers, and the carvings are exquisite, making them a unique art in the East, still a relic of the Northern Wei Dynasty.

By the Tang Dynasty, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism were equally valued. Lao Tzu was exclusively honored as Emperor Xuanyuan, simply because he shared the same surname as the imperial family. At the same time, Christianity, called Nestorianism, had already entered China, according to the Nestorian Stele, in the ninth year of Emperor Taizong's Zhenguan reign. Islam also entered China during the Tang Dynasty, with two theories: the second year of Emperor Taizong's Zhenguan reign and the second year of Emperor Gaozong's Yonghui reign. According to the basic annals of Emperor Gaozong in the Old Book of Tang, the Great Food State first sent envoys to pay tribute in the eighth month of the second year of Yonghui. The biographies of the Great Food in both the Old and New Books of Tang all record the year but not the month and day, so the second year of Yonghui is credible. In short, these five religions all have historical relationships in our country, and customs and people's hearts are all subject to a portion of their influence, which is an undeniable fact.

Mr. Shen, being old and having a weak voice, was supplemented by Mr. Yang Zhongyi, and it ended at five o'clock.

### Physician Qu Shaoheng Expresses Opinions on Midwifery Teacher Training: Modern Women Must Understand Midwifery Knowledge; Teachers Should Have Special Training

Childbirth is something that every family experiences, and every woman cannot avoid it. In the old customs of our country, we have always relied on midwives, who have no knowledge and lack reasonable experience. When entrusted with childbirth, they cannot prepare in advance, and often make mistakes afterward. When faced with difficult labor, they are at a loss. At best, they harm the fetus, and at worst, they bring disaster to the pregnant woman. Families who are confused by superstition only seek help from gods and Buddhas, and never make scientific rescues. Throughout the year, countless lives are lost in this way in the city of wrongful death.

Outline of Obstetrics

The highest education administrative authorities of the National Government, in view of this, have recently ordered the addition of an outline of obstetrics to the original physiology courses in girls' middle schools. Shanghai schools are currently discussing its implementation. Shaoheng has been practicing medicine and has devoted his efforts to obstetrics and gynecology. In Beijing and Shanghai, he decided to establish midwifery schools, aiming to popularize the common sense that every family needs and everyone should know into the minds of ordinary female compatriots. He also suggested to the education authorities that middle school girls should be instilled with obstetrical knowledge. Fortunately, the authorities ordered the addition of an outline of obstetrics to the original physiology courses in girls' middle schools. His 30-year-old wish has now been implemented by the wise authorities, and he privately rejoices.

Scientific Midwifery

There are also those in the educational circles of this city who inquire about the issue of teacher training. He once replied, "Adding an outline of obstetrics to girls' middle schools is not to have them perform midwifery duties, nor is it to have them study profound theories. In simple terms, it is to have them understand that obstetrics is related to the rise and fall of the nation. Childbirth is an extremely dangerous event, but if handled properly, it can turn danger into safety and be safe and sound. Therefore, if there is a pregnant person in the family, they must pay attention in advance, entrust the matter to the right person when the time comes, and take reasonable care afterward. Only by understanding the truth can they believe and obey. Therefore, future virtuous wives and good mothers must first be taught the importance of midwifery in schools, so that when they encounter childbirth in their families, it can be scientificized, so that the four words 'scientific childbirth' are deeply imprinted in everyone's minds. In that case, getting one pregnancy and giving birth to one person, the infant is healthy, the mother is safe, the reproduction of the population is the increase of national strength, and the well-being of the pregnant woman will avoid the weakening of the nation."

Teaching Points

From this, talking about the issue of teachers for the general knowledge course of midwifery, will we seek physicians who are proficient in theory? No. Will we seek midwives with accumulated experience? No. We must specially train those who are said to be experts in the theory of obstetrics, who must be able to explain it clearly and thoroughly. Regarding the techniques of midwifery, they must be able to explain it clearly and concisely. Time is limited, and in this short amount of time, they must instill the essential words that contain infinite meaning. They must grasp a central issue and explain all kinds of knowledge in a dazzling array, so that students, after attending this class, feel like they have watched a movie. When listening, they are focused, and when they leave class and go home, they tell their families about it with relish. In this way, they can achieve the purpose of the Ministry of Education's special order to add an outline of obstetrics.

Teacher Training

Next, talking about the issue of teachers, if physicians can refer to obstetrics, they can be competent. If not, midwifery graduates who have been practicing for three or several years can also be prepared to take on the task. However, teachers have teaching methods, especially for this kind of subject. Without special training, it is difficult to be pleasantly competent. Currently, in extraordinary times, Shanghai is a major trading port and a cultural center. Although it is an isolated island, education is concentrated and even surpasses the pre-war period. Taking midwifery schools as an example, there are six schools: Sino-German, Great German, Tongde, Shengsheng, Renhe, and Hygiene. There are also many graduates who practice or work in hospitals. In his humble opinion, each school should jointly set up a teacher training institute, recruit ambitious graduates, and train them, so as to alleviate the teacher shortage. As for the need for teachers in various places, qualified people can also be selected to enter the institute for training. After completing the study period, they will return to their respective services, wouldn't that be extremely convenient and satisfactory?

### Youth and Female Guide Commit Suicide Together, Deeply Poisoned, Lives in Danger

Chen Yun, a 23-year-old from Haiyan, Zhejiang, used to be a clerk in the Haiyan County government and is now unemployed. He lives in his brother's house at a certain number on Dongxin Bridge. Chen met Shen Xueying, a 19-year-old female guide from the West Lake Guide Agency, a native of Wuxi, a month ago. They fell in love at first sight and became deeply in love, privately vowing to be together for life. Unexpectedly, Chen Yun suddenly felt economic pressure recently and could not marry Shen Xueying. He became mentally disturbed and depressed. The day before yesterday afternoon, he went alone to the Daxin Hotel at 442 Guangxi Road in the Public Concession, booked room 322, paid the room fee, and then telephoned Shen Xueying. Shortly after, Shen arrived at the Daxin Hotel and entered the room. Chen Yun got up to greet her, and they talked and laughed as usual. Unexpectedly, at around 7 pm last night, Chen Yun and Shen Xueying both swallowed a large amount of poison and committed suicide. Later, the waiter discovered it and immediately called an ambulance to send the two to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that they were deeply poisoned and their lives were in danger.

### Appreciation of Guo Hua Ying's Calligraphy and Painting: Penmanship, Spirit, and Charm

This painting is from the hand of Lu Shiqian of Haining, imitating Wu Yushan, from which one can glimpse Wu Yushan's imitation of Fei Heshanqiao's technique. Huang He was a Yuan painter. Shiqian once said that since the time of the six masters of the Song Dynasty, Jing, Guan, Ma, Xia, Dong, and Ju, they have been the masters of painting for all ages. Since the Yuan Dynasty, Huang, Wang, Ni, and Wu have all followed Dong and Ju. Later generations called the two masters Dong and Ju the Southern School, and the four masters Jing, Guan, Ma, and Xia the Northern School. However, the principles are the same. The Northern School emphasizes penmanship, and the Southern School emphasizes spirit and charm. Both are excellent. From the Yuan Dynasty to the late Ming Dynasty, Dong Qichang founded the Southern School and rejected the Northern School. Since the Qing Dynasty, those who wrote in the Northern School have been as rare as morning stars. After the four Wangs, Wu, and Yun, no one has ever consulted its principles. Shiqian believes that the Northern and Southern Schools, the Northern is difficult and the Southern is easy, cannot be separated. Separating from the Northern School weakens the bone strength, and separating from the Southern School loses the spirit and charm. Seeking the combination of penmanship, spirit, and charm can be found in the paintings of Lu Shiqian, one can know the origin of the schools and obtain the samadhi of painting Zen.

### Tram Fire Case Adjourned Pending Judgment: Culprit Accused of Manslaughter, Knowing the Danger but Not Being Careful

On May 19, at around 3 pm, an electric tram on Route 16 of the Public Concession, traveling from the McGonagall Road station to the vicinity of the Shanhai Pass Road and Carter Road, suddenly caught fire in the third-class section of the car.

At that time, he was carrying a bag of celluloid green buttons, weighing 20 pounds, intending to send them to Tai'an Zhan Yongyuzhuang on Xiang Street in the French Concession.

### Concubine of Jewelry Merchant Attempts to Seize Inheritance

Liu Yaochang, a 45-year-old Suzhou native, lives at No. 6, Lane 18, Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge. His father, Liu Dongsheng, also known as Liu Dakui, opened the Quanchang Jewelry and Antique Shop on Nanjing Road and accumulated hundreds of thousands of assets. He lived with Tao Zhihao (50 years old this year) in concubinage at No. 106, Xuehua Fang, Xuehuali Road. Liu Dongsheng passed away on August 29, 1940. Tao took the opportunity when Liu's eldest son, Yaochang, went out to do business and sold all of the inheritance, antiques, and clothing. She also treated Dongsheng's biological daughter, Liu Sujun (21 years old), in every way, and neglected the household. She also forced Sujun to leave the family. Recently, she secretly used Dongsheng's wife's name to deceive the Shanghai Salt Industry Bank into opening Dongsheng's rented safety deposit box No. 518, claiming to break the box. Now, Dongsheng's eldest son, Liu Yaochang, has returned to Shanghai and learned of this. He immediately raised an objection to the bank and entrusted lawyer Wang Dazhong to represent him in filing a legal resolution against Tao Zhihao, accusing her of crimes such as seizing the inheritance.

### Daluo Tian Performs Nude Dance, Sentenced to Imprisonment and Fines, Times Theater Also Fined

The Daluo Tian Theater at No. 183 Guangxi Road was organized by Xu Pindan, a local. However, in the plays he performed, there was a scene in which a young girl appeared completely naked in front of 200 spectators, performing obscene acts, which was truly harmful to public morals.

### Reader's Letter: A Plea Regarding Increasing Tuition Fees

— Cao Wenhai

Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Cao Wenhai, a reader of our newspaper, which stated (excerpted above): "Children born in this era can truly be called 'unfortunate.' Why? Because the only happiness is that parents send their children to school. A person who does not study or cannot read is equivalent to being useless. It is pitiful that young children, just as they are happily carrying their schoolbags and diligently attending school, the environment in Shanghai suddenly changed drastically. Schools are relocating, teachers are frequently changing, and students cannot study in peace.

Since Shanghai became an 'isolated island,' prices have soared, and the cost of living has increased daily. It is already difficult to support a family of several people. For the educational expenses of their children, those in the propertied class are better off, but ordinary parents who rely solely on wages for a living are financially strained and cannot make ends meet. To ask them to pay for their children's education expenses is a real struggle.

Amidst the rising cost of living, school tuition fees are also increasing. Recalling the expenses for primary school three or four years ago, fourteen or fifteen yuan per semester, including books, was enough. Some public primary schools even cost less than ten yuan. How cheap that was!

Although tuition fees had already increased last year, primary school tuition was at most twenty-five yuan per semester, including books and all miscellaneous fees. However, even then, parents were already struggling to bear the burden. This year, it's even worse. Tuition for lower primary school has increased to twenty-six yuan, and with books and all miscellaneous fees, the total comes to thirty-four or thirty-five yuan. Upper primary school requires an additional ten yuan. This is for day students. If they are boarding students, they must add boarding fees. As for middle school tuition, the tuition for day students used to be just over twenty yuan per semester. Last year, it rose to forty-five yuan, and this year it has increased by half, reaching eighty or ninety yuan. Books and miscellaneous fees are extra. High school tuition has even exceeded one hundred yuan.

With tuition fees increasing, the prices of books have naturally skyrocketed. The cost of schooling for a child, taking primary school as an example, is almost forty or fifty yuan per semester, including books and miscellaneous fees. With such increases, school authorities may argue that it is due to increased salaries for teachers' union members and various other expenses, but it certainly does not amount to such a large sum. They must also consider the parents of children from wage-earning families. Living in this era, if they cannot afford the enormous tuition fees for their children, they will have to drop out of school. The purpose of running schools is to enthusiastically promote education and enhance national knowledge. Now, running schools as if they were businesses goes against the purpose of running schools. If schools are treated as businesses, know that society will have a few more children who are out of school and can only long for learning and sigh."

### Proposal for the Shanghai Municipal Council to Levy a High Tax on Silver Houses

— Cheng Zhao

Anyone who has paid attention to the advertisements in the past six months will have noticed that too many new silver houses have opened this year, to an alarming extent. Optimistically, this is a phenomenon that should exist in Shanghai's abnormal prosperity and speculative development. But thinking further, no one will forget the credit and exchange frenzy of the early Republic of China. At that time, the opening of trust companies and exchanges was no less than today. As a result, a group of them went bankrupt, causing panic in the entire financial community. Afterwards, the concession authorities and even the Chinese officials regretted that they had not taken measures to ban them beforehand and were too laissez-faire. Originally, even the painting of door frames required the formulation of various regulations and restrictions. How much more so should profit-making institutions related to economic organization and its safety? Such speculative businesses should not be left to their own devices. The reason is clear to everyone. Recently, because of the rise of Shuangma (double horse, referring to stocks), several silver houses have already gone bankrupt. Moreover, the international situation is intensifying day by day, and the future is truly unimaginable. Once there is any disturbance, the credit and exchange frenzy of the early Republic of China will inevitably repeat itself today. At that time, Shanghai's problems will not only be the question of who has the right to rule? It will not only be the problem of the livelihood of the citizens? There will also be the problem of the collapse of the entire economic organization. Leaving aside these issues, let's look at the current financial situation of the concession: all we hear about is increasing fees and taxes, but this speculative tax, which is beneficial to finance and has the effect of social policy, is set aside. Someone had already proposed it at the Western taxpayers' meeting this spring, and someone in this journal had also advocated it in the past. Now Mr. Shen has written an article proposing it again. Now that the old matter is being brought up again, and it is happening amidst the Shuangma frenzy and the silver house bankruptcy frenzy, we hope that the concession authorities will pay more attention to it. (Editor)

Since the outbreak of the war, refugees from all over the country have flocked to Shanghai. The large number of residents in Shanghai naturally increased the concentration of capital. Moreover, because of the establishment of the United Reserve Bank of North China in 1938, various trade policies and monetary policies were changed, and a large amount of capital escaped to Shanghai. Furthermore, because the Tianjin concession was threatened in 1939, even more capital from the north escaped to Shanghai. In the autumn of 1939, when the European war broke out, the British Far East colonies implemented economic controls, and the capital of overseas Chinese in those areas also escaped in large quantities. Although Shanghai experienced some capital flight to Hong Kong due to the establishment of the Huaxing Bank and the Central Reserve Bank, and the disturbances of the concession incident, the amount was small. And it soon flowed back, thus creating a place of excessive capital concentration.

### Poor Consumption of Collateral

After the outbreak of the war, Shanghai's transportation with the rest of the country was blocked. Various agricultural and native products in non-war zones could not be transported to Shanghai due to transportation issues or government bans. Those in war zones or guerrilla zones were mostly subject to strict controls. Furthermore, because the original emerging industries in various war zones were destroyed or occupied, most of the concession's raw materials had to rely on imported goods. However, the manufactured goods could not be sold to various parts of the country, so the most important object of capital flow was almost completely isolated. Here, the proper use or investment of capital became a problem.

### Loopholes in Capital Blockade

Shanghai is an international commercial port, and because the government's power was difficult to reach after the National Army moved west, phenomena such as the black market for exchange rates and the illegal trading of gold appeared. Although the National Government had restrictions on withdrawal orders, prohibitions on exchange rate subsidies, and exchange rate systems to prevent capital flight, they were not effective.

The only investment routes left in the concession were industry and commerce, real estate, and securities, and the scope was narrow. As a result, speculation flourished. Those with short-sightedness did not know that moving to another place was better, but instead used speculative businesses to stir up trouble. They created various schemes to seek quick profits. This is why the war silver industry flourished.

### Organization of Silver Houses After the War

The organizational structure of silver houses is based on the principle of buying and selling on behalf of customers and taking commissions. They are divided into various categories such as raw silk, US dollars, cotton yarn, and government bonds, and rarely engage in deposit and lending matters. For trading on behalf of customers, the margin for ordinary cotton yarn is 200 yuan per bale, and the commission is 80 cents. The margin for raw silk is 200 yuan per tael, and the commission is 1.5 yuan. The margin for US dollars is 50 yuan per hundred, and the commission is 1 yuan. The margin for government bonds is 50 yuan per thousand, and the commission is 50 cents. The silver houses are purely for the purpose of taking commissions, so they are similar to gambling with a cut. It is said that cotton yarn is the most active in trading. From the opening of the market at 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, the average daily trading volume per house is 200 bales. Therefore, the commission income from cotton yarn is also considerable. Most of these silver houses are partnerships with capital ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Some rent office space for business, while others set up shops. The sections of Five Horse Road, Sichuan Road, and Avenue Edward VII are the most prosperous. In total, there are more than 400 houses. Recently, a cotton yarn futures market has been established. Its organizational method is the same as that of the raw silk joint exchange, and it is operated in the manner of an exchange. The trading objects are all futures. Now, the organization of the cotton yarn exchange is described as follows: below the cotton yarn exchange are the large yarn houses or silver houses, which are brokers. Below them are the medium houses, which operate attached to the large houses. The Shanghai Cotton Yarn Exchange is the central location for buying and selling on paper. The large houses are brokers who buy and sell on behalf of customers. The medium houses are intermediaries who buy and sell on behalf of customers attached to the large houses. The large houses pay a margin to the cotton yarn exchange, which is responsible for safekeeping by the chairman of the exchange and the members of the safekeeping committee. The medium houses pay a margin to the large houses, which are kept by the large houses. Speculators trade with the large houses, and the margin is paid to the large houses. When trading with the medium houses, the margin is paid to the medium houses, and trading can be carried out.

### Indirect Impact of Silver Houses on Prices

Since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai's transportation with the rest of the country has been blocked, and transportation is difficult and often subject to controls. Therefore, goods cannot flow freely, resulting in sluggish sales, as mentioned above. However, speculators do not ask about supply and demand, but seek to temporarily create rumors and raise prices. They hoard as much current goods as possible to gain the benefit of scalping. This creates an artificial supply and demand, causing everything else to rise, layer upon layer. And the final outcome is still on the general public, who are unable to bear the burden. Today, anything that can suppress price increases, regardless of its motive, can be said to be beneficial to the public. Unexpectedly, the financial community in this city does not seek this, but instead uses speculative businesses, vigorously establishing gambling-like silver houses, and greatly facilitating and promoting speculation and hoarding. They create various schemes, fearing that prices will not rise.

### Reasons for High Taxation of Silver Houses and Benefits for All Sectors

Public expenditures are expanding, and revenue is insufficient. In order to ensure the safety of the concession's administration, it is reasonable to increase taxes. However, the authorities should take the principle of taking from the people without harming them and using it for the people as a standard. They must be fair and not allow ordinary people to bear too heavy a burden. Especially at this time and place, ordinary people are finding life increasingly difficult, and their burden should be avoided as much as possible. It is now clear to everyone that ordinary people are unable to pay new taxes. We must know that the reason why residents have the ability to pay taxes is purely because they have a corresponding income. Today, the income of ordinary people in Shanghai is decreasing day by day, while consumption is increasing. Therefore, the authorities must consider the ability of ordinary salaried workers and legitimate businesses to bear the burden of taxes. If this can be prepared, then the final burden, the ultimate burden, will not be placed on the general public, who are haggard, groaning, and unable to bear the burden of life, or are struggling to maintain it, or on legitimate businesses and industries. The silver house industry is a speculative business and is harmful to the residents of this city. And it is also a kind of profit-making business. In any case, it is reasonable to increase taxes. In this way, the residents of this city can enjoy complete social and public services.

### Advantages of Collecting Silver House Tax

1. Fairness: Residents pay taxes to be used by the authorities. It is always proportional to the strength within each person's possible range. In other words, taxes must be collected according to each person's ability. Those with greater ability bear more, and those with less ability bear less. Today, the salaries or profits earned by salaried workers or formal businesses each month are not enough to cover their living expenses and maintain their business, while silver houses are accidental income, or can be called unearned income. It is unfair for the authorities to levy taxes equally. Therefore, high taxation of silver houses and transaction taxes are fairer in any way.

2. Elasticity: Silver houses are a new type of enterprise after the war, and can also be called a special speculative business after the war. The Shanghai Municipal Council was able to proceed in an orderly manner during peacetime. There were no major changes in the financial budget. Today, the scope of action of the department has expanded in this extraordinary period. And because of currency and other relationships? The need for funding has greatly expanded. Silver houses have become a special industry during wartime, so they are well suited to meet their urgent needs and are a flexible tax.

3. Abundant Revenue: During the war, there were as many as six or seven hundred silver houses established. Taking cotton yarn alone, the average daily transaction volume per house is over two hundred bales. If calculated at a commission of one yuan per bale, then more than one hundred thousand yuan can be obtained per day. If the Shanghai Municipal Council were to donate a quarter of it, then thirty thousand yuan could be obtained per day. If a month is calculated as twenty-two days (excluding holidays), then six or seven hundred thousand yuan could be obtained. Raw silk, government bonds, US dollars, etc. are not included. If such a donation can be levied, it is estimated that eight or nine million yuan in donations can be obtained in the new budget year, and in fact, it is not just this number.

### Conclusion

The silver house in wartime is actually a tool for speculators. And the silver house is a cut-taking business that uses people's speculative profit-seeking psychology, disregarding everything, and only seeking quick profits. The impact is to increase the burden on ordinary people and make it difficult for industry and commerce to prosper. But if we want to solve the problem of prices and reduce the burden on ordinary people based on the current situation, it is indeed impossible. However, although it cannot be completely resolved, we also hope for a partial solution. Generally speaking, taking compensation from the authorities' assistance, at least part of the effectiveness is that if the authorities can levy high silver house donations at this time, the authorities can obtain reasonable funds to benefit the expansion of public expenditures. At the same time, it can indirectly: 1. Suppress prices. 2. Reduce speculation. 3. Transfer purchasing power. 4. Imply a ban on new silver houses by donation.

Some say that high silver house donations conflict with the National Government's income tax and wartime excess profits tax. But do not know that today's silver house organizations are already illegal, and would they be willing to pay this tax?

Some say that silver houses are a high-risk business, so the profits should also be proportional to it. But those who know the inside story know that there is no risk at all. Instead, it is a commission-receiving agency that enjoys the benefits. Therefore, high taxation of silver houses is indeed a win-win situation at present.

### Germany's Strategy for "Buying Up" French Assets

— Translated by Zhou Shuhua

The complete occupation of most French industries by Germany is undoubtedly the most organized and large-scale seizure in history. But besides its great quantity, what is most astonishing is that it differs from previous seizures of war booty. Because Germany "legally" paid the price for all occupied objects.

In the armistice agreement, France promised to compensate Germany 400 million francs per day. Converted at the official exchange rate, this huge sum is equivalent to just under 10 million US dollars. It is to maintain the German army in the French occupied zone.

But the cost of maintaining the German army in the French occupied zone is only 115 million francs per day. Therefore, after paying all the expenses of the army in the occupied zone, the German authorities have 175 million francs left over. One of its greatest uses is to buy French industries. By the end of this great shame, Germany hopes to legally control all of France's heavy industry, printing industry, and radio.

Outside of France, all French industries throughout Europe have been bought up by Germany. This includes the Skoda arms factory in Czechoslovakia and the largest copper mine in Europe, the Bor copper mine in Yugoslavia. The transfer of the Bor copper mine was agreed upon in Paris last winter by Laval, Ribbentrop, and Abetz before he was ousted in December. When General Petain heard this news, it is said that he said, "Laval is selling France piece by piece."

France's heavy industry (mostly in the south) and publishing industry have also been bought in large quantities. In the French occupied zone, most newspapers are partially or completely controlled by the Germans.

The Germans are doing their best to buy up Havas. Therefore, this French news agency and the nationally exclusive advertising agency had to be reorganized to avoid being completely taken over by the Germans. After this reorganization, Havas transferred all the rights to this wealthy exclusive advertising agency to Germany, but retained the real power of the news agency.

Hachette's, the largest printing and distribution trust, refused the German takeover. The Germans are particularly eager to control this company, because they hope to be able to manage the publication of school textbooks.

Because Hachette's refused the German takeover, it was greatly attacked by the Paris "Evening News" and other papers in Paris controlled by the Germans. They attacked Hachette's in every possible way, and the baseness of the words was simply unimaginable. These attacks were continuous.

This company will inevitably have to give in, although it has great resources. It has no guarantee and if the newspaper attacks are not effective, they will implement "investigations" and other means to force the company to submit.

If possible, the Germans always use milder means to solve all problems. Sometimes, they are willing to pay a higher price than the market price. Sometimes, when the factory owners are unwilling to sell to the Germans, the Germans hire French puppets to buy them. When these methods are not effective, they will release mild hints: "You can sell now or sell as soon as possible, otherwise your property may be confiscated."

Recently, the Paris'Oeuvre published the following notice:

"The board of directors of the French Bor Copper Mine Company hereby informs all shareholders that a German group intends to purchase the company's shares and manage all the company's business. This matter was expressly declared by the Minister of Finance on December 9, 1940. Regardless of the type of stock...the price is 3,500 francs per share. The sale of shares is voluntary...but this board of directors sincerely advises all shareholders to do it as soon as possible." Although there is no strong intention, no one will fail to understand its meaning.

Recently, the Vichy government enacted laws prohibiting French domestic and foreign legal persons from transferring property to people of other countries. If this law can be implemented, it will ease the trend of French industry being seized. But it cannot prevent the sale of private industries, because these types of stocks are not registered in the market. Many French heavy industries have been acquired by the Germans in this way. In the week that the decree was passed, a privately owned yarn factory in Lorraine was sold for 30 million francs.

### Issues Concerning the Reconstruction of County and Township Finance - Continued from Issue 374

— Li Bingyi

In its resolution, the business scope of county and township banks is prescribed as follows: (1) Re-mortgage, re-discount, or guaranteed credit loans. (2) Remittance connections. (3) Accepting deposits. (4) Acting as an agent for collection and disbursement. (5) Acting as an agent for issuing public bonds or corporate bonds. (6) Safekeeping of valuables or securities. (7) Savings business. In addition, they may issue agricultural and industrial bonds, but the total amount shall not exceed five times the paid-up capital, and it must be submitted for approval before implementation, which can be said to be quite cautious.

From the above-prescribed business scope, we can see that the central county and township banks, after handling re-mortgage and re-discount for various counties and townships, can prevent local areas from restricting lending due to capital turnover limitations. The issuance of agricultural and industrial bonds can solidify long-term credit into negotiable instruments, increasing general public confidence in investing in local production enterprises. However, in the initial stages of implementation, the government should provide interest subsidies to facilitate issuance. As for inter-county connections, in addition to remittance connections and acting as agents for collection and disbursement, if there are large-scale local special production enterprises, the central government should directly organize and guide joint lending, which would be much more dynamic and effective.

Furthermore, regarding the general principles of county and township lending business, not only should efforts be made to achieve regional universality, but also attention should be paid to the actual development of local agriculture, industry, and commerce, and the standards for lending ratios should be determined separately. While agriculture is undoubtedly important in local production enterprises, the small-scale industries processing agricultural products or other local specialties, family handicrafts, and local transportation and distribution commercial sectors cannot be ignored. In the current era of exchange economics, agriculture, industry, and commerce are all important links in the production sector and should not be neglected. Efforts should be made to achieve universal and balanced development to prevent goods from being stockpiled in rural areas, merchants from being trapped in cities, and various adverse phenomena caused by the stagnation of distribution mechanisms. In addition, the targets of lending must be accurate, ensuring that every penny of funds lent is indeed used in the production process of producers and is not used by others as a tool for exploiting interest gains. As for the amount of the loan and the duration, the actual needs of the loan's purpose should be the standard. Excessive amounts easily waste the use of funds, and if the duration is too short or the loan is too small, it is feared that despite having the name of a loan, there will ultimately be little practical benefit.

Banking business emphasizes both creditworthiness and lending, and what constitutes the majority of bank funds is not the bank's capital or reserve funds, but external deposits. Therefore, the development of county and township finance must first encourage savings, absorb as much scattered deposits as possible, and strive to utilize local dormant funds and transform private funds into bank deposits for use in production enterprises.

Regarding the management of operations, there are countless details, but I personally believe that two points are very important. First, the habit of using new-style financial institutions should be gradually cultivated among the general public. Procedures must be simple, time should be saved, and employees should be responsible for providing guidance at any time. Second, in addition to lending, there should be obligations to guide, advise, and supervise local industries regarding industrial technology and production processes, so that production technology can have opportunities for gradual improvement. However, employees should have special technical training. At the beginning of establishment, requiring outstanding operating results, the plan for nurturing talents for a century cannot be ignored.

In summary, the issue of county and township financial reconstruction is not only a necessary measure to increase wartime materials, but also the foundation of our national economic construction. The importance of the mission and the arduousness of the tasks undertaken by county and township banks are undeniable. However, the completion of county and township financial reconstruction also requires the joint cooperation of county and township personnel, which is inevitable. (The End)

### Yarn and Cotton: US Cotton Sales Surge, Prices Plummet

The New York cotton market fell due to mass selling and increased pressure from long liquidations and sales. At closing, prices plummeted by 47 to 54 points compared to the previous day. Spot prices for US cotton reached a new high of 15.8 cents yesterday.

The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to purchases by futures traders, then fell slightly due to sales by a few European exporters, then rose again due to active short covering, and finally fell again due to long liquidations. At closing, prices rose by 4 to 8 rupees compared to the previous day.

The forecast price for today's opening is expected to fall by 7.25 rupees.

Also, from September 1st of last year to June 28th of this year, Indian cotton statistics are recorded as follows (per bale of 400 pounds):

Total listed in Bombay: 2,809,000 bales

Remaining: 1,406,000 bales

Total listed in Karachi: 1,130,000 bales

Exported: 1,195,000 bales

Remaining: 245,000 bales

### Miscellaneous: Cigarette Market Regains Popularity

Cigarette purchase prices once fell, but the market has become popular again in recent days. The increase in taxes has stimulated public hoarding behavior and dealers are marking up prices, causing the price to show a strong situation. Yesterday's market price for brands such as Great Britain was 1,580 yuan per case, Old Knife was 1,142 yuan, Five Flowers was 764 yuan, Pine Sea brand was rare, opening at 1,090 yuan, no one sold. Small Fairy brand was 787 yuan, which was also more out of stock. Gold Mouse brand medium case was 510 yuan, Beautiful brand medium case was 770 yuan.

### Visit to You Sheng Waterproof Fabric Weaving Factory (Continued)

— Zhou Zhifeng

All female workers engaged in weaving undergo political training. Since the warp density of the waterproof fabric is high and the weft count is numerous (the work for female workers is much more difficult than for ordinary fabrics), when weaving, thread breaks or uneven yarn are often found, which must be removed with skilled techniques to avoid affecting future dyeing and sizing processes. After weaving, it is inspected and sent to the dyeing factory for dyeing (You Sheng factory's own dyeing department specializes in dyeing yarn and does not dye fabrics). After dyeing, it is sent back to the factory, where specialized technicians apply waterproof sizing. This process is extremely important. The waterproof effect requires: (1) the fabric to be firm and tough; (2) the fabric's structure to be special with correct diagonals; (3) the sizing to be perfect; (4) the chemicals used to be of high quality and properly mixed. Therefore, this work cannot be competently performed by anyone other than the manager and chief engineers. The factory has been researching the sizing process for many years, constantly improving it. Water resistance has been extended from 24 hours to 36 hours and is now achieving 72 hours. After sizing and drying, perfect waterproof fabric is produced. You Sheng Factory was founded by alumni of the Textile Department of Nantong University. Most of the persons in charge have worked in major textile and dyeing factories for many years and each has expertise in chemical dyeing and textile technology. The factory is still carefully researching to make the Golden Bear brand waterproof fabric achieve 100 hours of water resistance. Once the experiment is successful, it can be manufactured in large quantities, expanding from 500 yards to 2,000 yards per day. At that time, it will not only meet domestic demand but also be able to compete in the Southeast Asian market. In places such as Batavia and the East Indies, it rains for five or six days continuously during the rainy season, so raincoats that are not waterproof for dozens of hours cannot sell well in Southeast Asia. Only the products of You Sheng Factory have this long-term hope, which is also the glory of national goods. (The End)

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### The Application of Color in Venues, Pavilions, and Factories

— Wang Yizhi

Dyeing and weaving are related to clothing, cooking is related to food, repelling heat and flies is related to housing, and inspecting machinery is related to transportation...

The latest inventions in the scientific field of color application in Western countries are full of ingenious ideas, which are directly applied to factories and venues, and indirectly benefit clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Here, I have summarized the strengths of various schools and listed the main points as follows.

(1) Colors are divided into warm and cool: If the interior decoration of a house is entirely red, the occupants will feel very hot. If red is not used and the entire room is decorated in blue, people will feel very cool. This perception of cold and heat varies with the color. This is true for humans, and it is also true for flies (mosquitoes like to be near dark colors). Flies are afraid of cold, so in kitchens where cooking is done, blue tiles are used, and flies do not want to stay long and leave quickly.

(2) Color affects work efficiency: In machine rooms with excessive manpower, if the walls are painted blue, the workers will feel slightly cooler inside. Blacksmiths working under blue light achieve better results.

(3) A bright and clean new life: New-style housing has a simple structure and is bright throughout the room, matched with lightly yellow or light green furniture without decoration. Even a little dust is easily noticed, making it easy to develop a habit of cleanliness.

(4) Neutral light for identifying colors: It is not easy to obtain accurate colors under artificial light. However, the colors seen by everyone under sunlight are not entirely accurate either. Dr. Tschermak, a famous physics professor from Prague, Czech Republic, recently invented the "Neutral-Lichtlampe," which makes the color-identifying light pass through many light filters. Using this lamp to identify colors is accurate to the smallest detail, and the colors it uses for determination are even more accurate than daylight. This lamp has a wide range of uses in dyeing, weaving, printing, and other factories.

(5) Hang blue curtains to select yellow pearls: After looking at various colors for a long time, people's eyes become fatigued. Workers in artificial pearl factories are constantly exposed to scarlet (bright red) and coral red (red with a hint of yellow), and often make many mistakes due to eye fatigue. It is best to add a slightly blue light to the room to make the difference between these two red colors more apparent and reduce eye fatigue. If it is a studio where yellow is selected all day long, blue curtains should be hung high on the walls so that everyone feels the atmosphere is tinged with blue light due to the reflection of blue light.

(6) Lamps with shades enhance reflection: Using colored lights at night to identify colorful drawings or items can also make the difference between similar colors stronger, thereby reducing eye fatigue.

(7) Dark corners are beneficial for restoring correct vision: If someone has free time to stay quietly in a dark room, open their eyes, and let them be cleansed by darkness (this is called bathing in darkness, which is the opposite of naked body exposure to sunlight, called "sunbathing"), and then go out into the sunlight, then their vision will be temporarily clear and fresh, and it will be very accurate to use it to identify colors.

(8) Cake shops and restaurants have the beauty of "not having it both ways": When food changes from raw to cooked, cooks often have a habit of silently measuring the depth of cooking and the degree of heat by changing the color. However, if the room lights are too bright, suddenly making the color difference between slightly焦 and un焦 stronger, or even misidentifying the un焦 color as slightly焦, the food is often taken out hurriedly when it is only half-cooked. This is a common dispute encountered by cake shops and restaurants, which is the opposite of the weakness of color difference in artificial pearl factories. However, both the missed opportunity and the misjudgment are the same mistake. Recently, people have tried to find a way to remedy it, saying that the walls next to the stove should be painted in advance to the color of焦 yellow that is just right for the degree of heat.

(9) Color identification can detect weaknesses inside machines: The internal components of machines often cannot be measured in detail with a "thermometer" due to the speed of rotation or the pressure is too strong, resulting in high or low temperatures during operation. A new method is to brush on a paint that easily changes color due to high heat. Take a look at it while the heat is rising, so you can know which parts inside the machine are the hottest and which are too hot, and thereby detect where the weaknesses are in the entire machine. This is also an amazing achievement that the predecessors did not expect.

### Two New Products from Shen Fang Silk Mill

— Junmei

This summer's popular women's clothing material is a wool and linen interwoven color horizontal stripe palicos. At first glance, this fabric is soft and comfortable, as if it is very elegant. But upon closer inspection, its coarseness is actually no less than that of burlap. However, this fabric has a beautiful reputation as an "imported product" and a noble price of seventy or eighty yuan per qipao.

In fact, Shen Fang, a domestic silk mill, also has two new products of summer clothing material: one is a color horizontal stripe raw silk fabric similar to the aforementioned palicos. It is a women's clothing material. Both the warp and weft are made of natural silk. The warp is pure white and the weft is woven with colored silk. The width is one foot five inches, which happens to match the use of qipao. Because it is raw silk fabric, the texture is relatively stiff, but transparent and light, no less than ordinary raw silk or gauze. The material cost of each qipao is only seven or eight yuan, and its low price in domestic silk can be said to be unmatched. Even though its toughness is relatively weak, ordinary women only wear summer qipao for going out, so it is very suitable and economical. Moreover, it is only once a year, right?

The other product is a completely factory silk electric weaving spun silk, with a width of two feet two inches. The warp and weft are woven with high-quality factory silk, so the silk surface is smooth and clean, and the body is relatively heavy, each foot weighs more than seven or eight cents, which is very suitable for tailoring men's long gowns or shirts. The advantage of this factory silk spun silk is that it is washable and durable, the color becomes brighter and cleaner after washing, and the body becomes tighter after washing. Compared with the earlier bright silk and imported Indian silk and other fabrics, it is not the same. Moreover, the price is also very cheap. Silk shops sell it for about four yuan per foot, but buying it directly from Shen Zhou Zhuang is only 120-130 yuan per piece of 4.6 zhang, which is only 2.7-2.8 yuan per foot, which is still relatively cheap compared to other silk fabrics.

### Preventing Soy Sauce from Molding and Its Use

— Qiu Lang

This publication has published many articles on the discussion of soy sauce and stomach diseases. The author is ashamed of not having this experience and dare not talk about it. The following is a brief description of several points on preventing soy sauce from molding and its use, to contribute to readers.

Although soy sauce is an important ingredient for cooking, its usage should be determined by the dishes being cooked. Generally, red-braised fish and meat should be used more, but clear stewed and cured dishes should not be added with soy sauce. For dishes such as toon mixed with tofu, it is better not to add soy sauce. However, recently the weather has entered the moldy season, and soy sauce is prone to mold (i.e., white flowers appear). To avoid this, the soy sauce can be boiled in a pot first, and after it cools down, pour it into a bottle. The bottle stopper should be tightened, but the bottle must be wiped clean first and no water droplets should be left, so it will not mold even after long storage.

In addition to seasoning, soy sauce can relieve drunkenness and relieve pain. For those who are drunk, brew strong soy sauce soup and drink it to relieve it. Also, when the skin is scalded by boiling water or fire and has not ruptured, apply soy sauce to the affected area to relieve the pain. However, if the face has recently recovered from sores, you cannot dip food in raw soy sauce, otherwise black spots will appear and damage the appearance. These are small common sense tips for eating soy sauce.

### A Week's Simple Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

There are two types of beans that have been on the market recently, one is edamame, and the other is cowpea. Edamame is four or five cents per two, and cowpea is three or four cents per two. Of course, these prices are not cheap. However, whether it is meat or vegetarian dishes, what is cheap these days? Beans are rich in vitamins, and eating some every day is very beneficial. Edamame can be used as a supplement to various meat and vegetarian dishes. In addition, for meat dishes, it can be braised with pork or beef. For vegetarian dishes, you can coat the shells with batter and red-braise them. Both are great dishes to serve with rice. For cowpea meat dishes, you can stir-fry them with shredded meat or sliced meat. For vegetarian dishes, you only need to add some fried dough sticks and dried shredded tofu and stir-fry them.

### Books and Housing

— Qing

Books are records of human knowledge. Old historical sites and new inventions all require systematic descriptions to be found in books. However, books themselves are not only the main food of knowledge, but also a kind of pastime to regulate the spirit. Isn't it possible to get endless fun by holding a volume in hand in leisure?

Therefore, I deeply feel that every family must have a considerable number of books, prepared for the whole family to use for leisure time, and to increase knowledge and wisdom invisibly. In our daily progress, we should spend some on books - a daily newspaper, several magazines and pictorials. In addition to this, reference books such as dictionaries, daily encyclopedias, medicine and health, cooking, sewing, etc. are also indispensable. As for families with children, it is even more necessary to add several children's books to develop children's habits of reading books.

Each purchase of books does not need to buy too much, you should estimate the amount of leisure time to determine the number to buy. Otherwise, if there are more books and less leisure time, and the reading is not finished, it will often cause boredom or even give up on them. But if there are fewer books and more leisure time, then improper entertainment will take advantage of this gap and seduce us. This point naturally requires a reading ability test before you can buy the appropriate amount of books in the bookstore.

The placement of books is also an important issue. If they are displayed properly, it will of course help the decoration of the house. Otherwise, if they are scattered in pieces, one in the east and one in the west, it will hinder the appearance and violate the condition of "cleanliness". Now, the place where we place books does not necessarily have to have bookshelves and bookcases, as long as they are placed in a suitable and easy-to-access place.

### The Morality of Walking

— Yiming

Walking is a very common thing, so people in general have always paid no attention to walking, whether it is hygiene, safety, morality, etc., especially no attention to the morality of walking.

We often see some people walking, running around like a race, never considering the safety of the old, the weak and women, so accidents of being knocked down and trampled on can often happen, and some people do the opposite, looking around on the road, pacing, and even hand-in-hand in a row (especially women), so that no matter what important things people have, they can only patiently let them go. Also, when it rains, people with umbrellas always walk close to the roots of the wall, while those with bare bodies are squeezed onto the road to rain. Also, when someone carrying heavy objects walks in front or behind (in fact, the most people carrying heavy objects are coolies and apprentices, who should be sympathized with), the ones with empty hands (also the most intellectuals) not only do not show sympathy and give way, but also put on a serious face and reprimand others for bumping into them.

Similar contradictory facts tell us that the general public's moral concepts are really too underestimated. In other words, it is that the general public still does not understand the meaning of morality, and it needs to be used at any time and place, and can be expressed in any action. Therefore, when walking, in addition to paying attention to walking and safety, it is also necessary to pay attention to morality.

### New Talks on "Living" Overseas

A famous photographer in New York named Bao Kebai unexpectedly enlarged photos to replace wallpaper. Since this news came out, many libraries and travel agencies have asked him to design with various charts, maps, and photos of ships to remodel the walls. It is said that this novel invention can also be applied to offices or ordinary shops to increase people's interest.

Spring and Autumn

### The Story of Zhong Kui

— Yang Yan

The Jinshi Zhong advanced in the clouds.

Suddenly, he pressed down on the cloud head, sniffed deeply into the air with his nose, eh! Such a dense ghostly aura. He felt a little strange, but also a little happy. He touched his stomach, imagining a rich breakfast in his mind, so he urged the cloud head and chased directly after the ghostly smell.

"Immortal, please slow down!" A voice stopped him. He turned around and saw a person wearing strange clothes. "Who are you!" Zhong Kui asked strangely. "Little god is the local earth god." The person in strange clothes replied respectfully.

"Oh! But your clothes?..." Zhong Kui scratched his messy hair and asked hesitantly.

"This is a suit, because this is a concession, so little god has to wear a suit." The earth god explained respectfully again.

"Oh!" Zhong Kui responded casually, his mind only on the many ghosts, so he immediately shifted the topic to this: "Why are there so many ghosts here?" he asked.

"This... this..." The earth god couldn't answer for a moment.

"What kind of ghosts are they?"

"There are many kinds of ghosts, there are lustful ghosts, pale-faced ghosts, gambling ghosts, and hoarding ghosts..."

"What! Hoarding ghosts?" Although Zhong Kui had captured many ghosts, he had never heard of this name before.

"Yes, this is a newly emerged ghost. This kind of ghost specializes in hiding things that humans use daily, causing people to starve to death and freeze to death."

"Humph! Such hateful ghosts." Zhong Kui angrily stroked the curly beard under his chin, and a terrifying light radiated from his big eyes. "Good! Let me go and wipe them out completely!"

"Wait, Immortal! You will definitely suffer if you go alone." The suit-wearing earth god shouted in horror.

Zhong Kui pressed down on the cloud head: "Nonsense, don't you know that I am Zhong Kui, who specializes in devouring ghosts?"

"No, Immortal, I know. But there are indeed many ghosts. They are in contact with each other, are good at creating "ghost walls," and are sometimes not afraid of the city god. They also have money and power. Moreover, they have long anticipated that the Immortal is coming and have already prepared a plan to deal with it."

"Oh!" Zhong Kui also felt a little tricky: "Then what should I do?"

### Street Corners

— Yao Yao

Little beggar: Sir! Your shoelace is loose.

Passerby: Hmm!

Little beggar: Sir! How much?

Passerby: What?

Little beggar: Five cents, please! Have pity.

Maid A: Alas! Vegetables are really expensive, and oil is even harder to come by.

Maid B: Isn't it? In the past month, after scraping together all the bits and pieces, it only amounted to one dollar and seven cents. Do you think it's hard or not?

Housewife: Maid! How much is this piece of meat?

Maid A: Two dollars.

Housewife: Why did I just ask and they said it was one and a half dollars?

Maid B: Young mistress! Yes. She bought one and a half dollars first, then thought it wasn't enough to eat, so she went to another store to add another fifty cents, totaling two dollars.

Housewife: Hmm! So I only asked one store, I wronged you. How is five dollars a month enough? You are indeed too poor, you should, you should…

Rickshaw puller: Hey! That one? That one?

Young master: The Great Light.

Rickshaw puller: Five dollars! Five dollars!

Young master: At most two dollars.

Rickshaw puller: Alas! Crossing the flood is not easy!

Young master: Then you pull me across the Huangpu River for a hundred dollars, okay?

Rickshaw puller: Shh—

10 The Heart of a Loving Father

"Dad, I don't want to make new clothes anymore! Why don't you wear them yourself?" Mei Bao said this several times, and even cried and argued with her father.

"Child, I am a farmer, I don't need to be particular." Qiu Haitang always comforted her like this. "Unlike you, you are a female student. If you dress too poorly, people will laugh at you."

"No, let them laugh! Won't people laugh if their own father is dressed so raggedly?" Although Mei Bao was only a twelve-year-old child, she already spoke very cleverly. "The other day Mr. Gu asked me: "Wu Meiying, is the one who picks you up every day hired by your family?" Dad, do you think I feel good about it?"

But no matter how Mei Bao persuaded him, Qiu Haitang was still reluctant to spend a penny for himself, because he basically only had very little money left; he wanted to use all of this limited money to cultivate his beloved daughter.

He smiled at Little Gouzi, then unflinchingly held up the umbrella and walked towards the east of the town in the heavy rain along the stone road.

Spring rain in the north was already a very rare thing, and today's rain was particularly heavy; at the same time, the wind was also very strong, carrying strands of rain like noodles, sweeping straight from the northeast, although Qiu Haitang had an umbrella in his hand, his body was still inevitably wetted by the rain in several places.

From the second month after Wu Da returned to Li Village from Beiping, Qiu Haitang moved to Zhangshu Village with Mei Bao and Zhang Xiaogouzi; because this was Zhang Xiaogouzi's hometown, they were able to easily buy two small houses and four or five acres of barren land to live in.

He not only sent away Wang Si's family, but also sold all the fields and houses that were originally in Li Village. He told Grandpa Wu that he was going to Jinan to find a friend to do some business together.

"That's good! As the saying goes, sitting and eating will empty the mountain, you should go out and make a living!" Grandpa Wu did not object either. In fact, Qiu Haitang's house was sold by him; and he knew very well that the silver that Qiu Haitang had saved in Beiping had all been lost, and he really had very little left in his hand. There would not necessarily be many benefits to continuing to live with him, so it would be better for everyone to separate earlier. (145)

### Every Graduate Hopes to Have Such a Diploma

### "Sea Hero" on Land

— Yaoting

After this heavy rain, many places with lower terrain were still covered with water.

On ×× Road, the water accumulated quite deeply. In the water, there was a group of homeless children, who could be called "sea heroes" on land. When every rickshaw passed by, as long as the passenger was a modern girl, they would rush up to carry out their work.

"Take out the corner tickets!"

"If you don't take them out, we'll splash water!" When the passenger on the rickshaw showed surprise or a little difficulty, it was followed by a warning.

Then corner tickets one by one... fell into their hands, and the rickshaw could pass safely.

"Sea heroes" on land! Should they do this?

### A Brief Scene of a Rainstorm

— Huan Su

Street

"Rickshaw! How much to Carter Road!"

"No exaggeration, one and a half dollars."

"Nonsense, usually it only costs twenty cents on a normal day."

"Sir, it's raining heavily, and we have to fill our stomachs!"

"Alas! The weather is not good!" Little Sanzi's mother sighed.

"Mom! I'm hungry," Little beggar Sanzi pulled at his mother's clothes.

"Good child, don't you see it's raining? And there are so few pedestrians!" Mother turned around, the newspaper on her body was wet with rain and stuck tightly to her body, and a few sparse pieces of rotten grass fell off.

Vegetable Market

A Jin thought: "It's raining today, so vegetables will definitely be expensive! Reporting more to the Tai Tai will definitely not be suspected."

"Hey! How much is a catty of baby bok choy!"

"Three corners!"

"Dizzy, what are you saying! Don't treat me like a fool!"

"Look at what kind of weather it is today and say that! Do you know that the water on the road is up to your knees?"

### A Corner of the Mansion

"It's raining cats and dogs! Old Master, are you still planning to go out?" Sixth Concubine squinted at the Old Master by the window.

"The mountain rain is coming, and the wind is filling the building." The Old Master paced back and forth, humming like a refined person. In fact, he didn't understand the meaning of this sentence, but he heard Lao Song saying it in the stock exchange to describe speculation.

"If you're not going out, let's play eight rounds." Fifth Concubine joined in the fun.

After a while, laughter drowned out all the sounds of the mahjong tiles.

### Dogs and Secretaries

— Yao Yao

In the mansion of a certain great lawyer, there are three pug dogs, who are fed meat and high-quality white rice every day, and are also bathed with medicinal soap. Each dog costs at least two or three dollars a day, but the lawyer's secretary, who writes until night every day, only receives fifty old ocean dollars a month, alas! People are inferior to dogs, what else is there to say!
