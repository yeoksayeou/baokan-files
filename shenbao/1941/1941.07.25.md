### Anglo-American Agreed Joint Plan: Economic Sanctions Against Japan to Include Freezing of Funds and Implementation of Embargo; Diplomatic Action Also Possible

United Press International, Washington, 24th. Sources close to the government indicated last night that the United States has prepared a new plan to implement against Japan if necessary. However, this plan will likely not be implemented unless Japan strikes at the South Seas or the Soviet Union. Some sources speculate that the US may take diplomatic action, such as expelling Japanese consuls from the United States.

Reuters, Washington, 24th. According to unconfirmed reports, Britain and the United States have agreed on a joint plan for economic sanctions, consisting of approximately three measures: (1) termination of US gold purchases; (2) freezing of Japanese funds; and (3) a complete ban on key exports to Japan. It is heard that the outflow of Japanese gold is more frequent than usual, apparently with Japan acting as an intermediary to use German gold to purchase US dollars on behalf of the Axis powers. Those in the know feel that the possibility of China assisting Vietnam in resisting is difficult to realize, as the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway within Chinese territory has long been dismantled. Transporting troops and war materials through mountainous areas seems impossible, though China has indeed undertaken long expeditions in difficult terrain. It is generally expected that the Japanese will first use naval forces and then land troops in the Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay areas. Observers believe that Japan has chosen this time to act because they think President Roosevelt is currently trying to get Congress to pass the extension of the military service act and cannot do much. It is believed that Japan's actions are purely for its own benefit, with the Axis powers only indirectly benefiting. Japan seems to believe that its actions in Vietnam are something it can do without provoking a military response from Britain and the United States. If this succeeds, Japan will be closer to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, and will be able to launch attacks nearby when the opportunity arises. However, it is almost certain that the United States will take some action. A senior official in the State Department said in a private conversation that if Japan takes aggressive action against Vietnam, the United States is prepared to respond.

United Press International, London, 24th. British officials yesterday remained silent on the news leaked from Washington regarding the joint British-American preparation to freeze Japanese funds. This measure will be of the same nature as the freezing of German and Italian funds. Britain and the United States will also jointly impose an embargo on Japan. British and American companies that have previously sold oil to Japan will have their orders confiscated by the British and American authorities if they accept Japanese orders again. Observers can infer from the import situation announced by Japan that if Japan cannot obtain cotton from India and timber from Australia, Japan's textile industry will be forced to shut down. Japan has funds totaling millions of dollars in Britain and the United States. Once frozen, it will be difficult for Japan to pay for all import and export goods.

### South African Japanese Enterprises Completely Shut Down

Reuters, Johannesburg, 24th. Japanese enterprises in South Africa have now completely shut down. All Japanese expatriates, except for three, will depart for Japan this week. Japanese consulate and diplomatic personnel will remain, but their families are packing and leaving. The Japanese ship Manila Maru is currently stationed in Cape Town to carry Japanese expatriates back to their country. A representative of Osaka Shosen Kaisha stated today that he had received a notice from Japan that shipping services to South Africa would be temporarily terminated. Therefore, the Manila Maru and another Japanese ship, the Belgian Maru, will be the last Japanese ships to arrive in South African territorial waters. Freezing Japanese funds will also cut off Japan's export trade. For example, once the United States freezes Japanese funds, Japan will not be able to continue its raw silk trade to the United States, as what it obtains is US dollars.

International News Service, London, 24th. The British government announced today that Britain is closely discussing the situation in the Pacific with the United States and other related countries, and is prepared to deal with Japan's military actions southward into Vietnam. However, it did not specify how far the British government is prepared to go in this matter, nor did it detail the extent to which Britain and the United States will cooperate in the event of trouble in the Far East.

Taiwan News Agency, Washington, 24th. President Roosevelt and his entire military and diplomatic leadership are paying close attention to all of Japan's actions and are prepared to take action when the interests of the United States appear to be directly or significantly harmed. However, Navy Secretary Knox's statement that the US Navy is prepared to act is not considered an indication that the United States will oppose Japan's occupation of Vietnam, but rather an indication that if Japan expands its actions further, it will be met with opposition from the United States.

United Press International, Washington, 24th. Senator Connally, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned at a committee meeting yesterday that if the United States cuts off oil shipments to Japan, Japan will be forced to enter the Dutch East Indies. He said that cutting off this transport is a good way to force Japan to take that military action. He made this statement while the Senate committee was meeting to review national defense. Senator Mead, a Democrat from New York, pointed out that although there is a shortage of gasoline products on the East Coast recently, 100,000 barrels of oil are still being shipped from the West Coast to Japan.

Havas, Washington, 24th. Senator George, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the policy adopted by the United States toward the threatened invasion of Vietnam may not be entirely consistent with that of the United Kingdom. The United States should pursue a purely American policy in the Far East. For this reason, joint action by Britain and the United States is unlikely. He heard that the Panama Canal will be closed indefinitely for repairs, prohibiting merchant ships from passing through. Nomura's frequent visits to the State Department have aroused much speculation. It seems that Japan is preparing to send a new note to Japan, explaining the new threat of military action in the Pacific. Nomura's visit to the State Department is particularly noteworthy. When reporters questioned Welles about Secretary Knox's remarks, he replied that he had nothing to criticize and could only draw attention to President Roosevelt's remarks on Tuesday.

Reuters, Washington, 24th. US Undersecretary of State Welles met with Japanese Ambassador Nomura last night and reportedly told Nomura that any action by Japan that is detrimental to Vietnam or elsewhere will further worsen US-Japan relations. Many observers here have long expected Japan to make demands regarding Cam Ranh Bay, but the demand involving the occupation of all of South Vietnam, as reported yesterday, was particularly unexpected. The US administrative industry is discussing with legislative leaders possible Japanese demands in order to cope with Japanese actions.

### Civilized Nations Will Never Disregard Land Interests in the Pacific

Reuters, London, 24th. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the authenticity of Japan's ultimatum to Vichy regarding Vietnam is almost beyond doubt. Japan has now established its power in northern Vietnam, and it is not easy to stop its expansion to the south. However, the Japanese government may not be satisfied with occupying the entire territory of Vietnam and will certainly use Vietnam as a starting point for its larger imperial expansion plans. Whether Japan will look south to connect with the Dutch East Indies or invade Thailand to cut off the Burma Road, the lifeline of Chongqing, is unpredictable. However, one thing is clearly visible: whether Japan moves south or west, it will be a direct threat to British and American interests. Japan is currently only exchanging information on the planned actions. As for the advantages Japan has gained in Vietnam in terms of land and naval forces, which could lead to a major Pacific war, the United States could implement several measures, such as freezing Japanese funds in the United States and restricting trade with Japan to the level before the war. However, it is still questionable whether the United States will take extreme steps, because if the United States suddenly bans the export of kerosene and various major items to Japan, Japan may immediately attack the Dutch East Indies. The authorities hope that even if Japan invades Vietnam, it will not cause serious disturbances to the current situation in the Far East. At the same time, a politician said that if Japan completely controls Vietnam, the United States will change its current policy of compromise with Japan and take joint action with Britain to protect their respective interests in the Far East. So far, the official attitude towards the French-Japanese negotiations on Vietnam is still unknown, but Undersecretary of State Welles fully explained the US position when he met with Japanese Ambassador to the United States, General Nomura, last night. In addition, experts on Far Eastern issues also said that Britain and the United States can never allow Japan to gain a superior strategic position near the British and American lifelines in the Pacific.

### Nomura Visited Welles the Night Before Last; US-Japan Relations Will Worsen

Reuters, Washington, 24th. Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura visited Undersecretary of State Welles last night and reportedly discussed the situation in the Far East, especially Vietnam. It is believed that Welles clearly expressed to Nomura the deep concern of the United States for maintaining peace. The conversation lasted half an hour. Afterwards, Welles told reporters that he hoped that the sentiment between the United States and Japan could gradually improve, but he was unwilling to express any opinion, only saying, "I have handled this matter from our side." Nomura also told people that he discussed the problem of Japanese ships not being able to pass through the Panama Canal. Japanese ships cannot wait long in the Panama Canal, so eight or ten ships have sailed south and will consider their actions after circumnavigating South America. Before making a decision, they will give it very careful consideration. London and Washington are closely watching this situation. The two governments have often consulted on various possible developments, and Australia and other autonomous regions have also participated in discussions and exchanged opinions.

Reuters, London, 24th. The Daily Telegraph editorial stated that if Japan occupies Vietnam, whether it obtains Vichy's permission or not, it is ultimately an act of aggression. Britain is not without retaliatory methods in this regard. Japan's purpose in Vietnam is to use it as a base for future seizure of all British, American, and Dutch interests and lands in the Western Pacific. Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands will never ignore this situation. The Yorkshire Post said that we do not need to pay attention to the statement that Japan has acted with the consent of the French. The Japanese want to use Vietnam as a base so that they can attack the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, and Thailand sooner or later. Their ultimate goal is to rule the Pacific region from Singapore to Hong Kong and the Philippines to Australia. This is the explanation of their so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, no matter what actions Japan takes in Vietnam, Britain and the United States cannot view it with indifference. The Scotsman said that Britain and the United States cannot ignore Japan's occupation of all of Vietnam or important locations in Vietnam, because it is the first step in Japan's policy of ruling the Pacific. The current situation is indeed pressing, but there is no need to overemphasize it, because Japan would not dare to challenge a strong enemy. The Liverpool Daily Post said that Tokyo is controlled by the military and imperialists, and based on past experience, Japan's ambitions have no end.

Havas, Tokyo, 23rd. According to reliable sources, the Japanese authorities are quite uneasy about the various actions taken by Britain and the United States in the South Pacific. They all believe that if Japan does not immediately take counter-measures, it will be surrounded. The new Foreign Minister, Toyoda, with the support of Prime Minister Konoe and all cabinet members, attaches great importance to this matter. Because the actions of Britain and the United States are sufficient to hinder Japan's southward advance, the urgency of this issue has exceeded all other issues, even the impact that the Soviet Union's defeat in Europe could have on the Far East. However, Japan will still maintain the principle of peaceful southward advance, and its actions will be limited to purely defensive purposes, striving to ensure that Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will not be surrounded by Britain and the United States, while at the same time not hindering the interests or territories of Britain and the United States in the Far East. In short, Japan's goal is to be in a leading position in East Asia.

Editorial

### Responding to the V-for-Victory Movement

The V-for-Victory movement, symbolizing the victory of democracy, has swept across all regions of Europe under Nazi occupation after being promoted by British Prime Minister Churchill, sending a bright signal to the people under the shroud of darkness and slavery. Now this movement has crossed the Atlantic from Britain to the west, and has received great support in the New World. Even the United States and some Latin American countries have a victory movement that is gradually being promoted. Recently, the Nazi authorities, unable to stop the people in the occupied areas from yearning for this movement, turned around and twisted the V-for-Victory movement into a symbol of Nazi victory in order to transform it into propaganda that would benefit them. In today's world, the victory of democracy is entrusted to the largest part of humanity, while the supporters of Nazi victory are probably only a few blind worshipers of Hitler and National Socialism, and a very small number of people who have lost faith, such as Laval, Quisling and others. The existence of a fake shadow of the V-for-Victory movement does not harm the brightness of the sun and moon. The authenticity of the matter does not need to be further clarified.

Taking the victory of democracy as the savior of mankind and civilization, some people may have reservations about it some time ago, but the recent development of international events has confirmed the irrefutable truth of this statement. First, in the aggressor's attempt to establish a so-called "new order", although only Asia and Europe have been clearly announced, with their unlimited greed, it is difficult to easily let go of other parts of the world, whether it is the American continent far across the ocean or the uninhabited Antarctica. Therefore, as of today, there is no land or people that are not regarded as objects of annexation by the aggressor. At the same time, as long as the crime of aggression has not been eradicated, it will be difficult for the people of the world to rest easy. Second, the outbreak of the Soviet-German war followed by the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet shows the more obvious collusion of the aggression front. On the other hand, the two groups of wars in Asia and Europe have merged from separation, and the interests of China, the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union are becoming more consistent. Under this circumstance, the subsequent war is no different from a single war, and the future victory is also summarized as a victory for democracy. Third, of course, there are many twists and turns in the future. For example, the principles for establishing peace after the war as discussed by US Deputy Secretary of State Welles some time ago may not have completely reached the center of the problem, but in terms of the current situation, striving for the victory of democracy is indeed the prerequisite for everything in the future. Only after aggression has disappeared and justice has been restored can the world calmly consider various far-reaching plans and ideals to lay the foundation for permanent happiness and tranquility for the world and mankind. Therefore, the present is a critical moment in the history of human survival. Whether it is the Eastern Hemisphere or the New World, old economic systems or socialist countries, they can only consider how to win the anti-aggression war as the first priority.

Now the V-for-Victory movement is popular in the West, forming a symbol of future peace and happiness. It is hoped that under the stimulation of this novel propaganda, the people of Europe and the United States can double their anti-aggression strength and exert the effectiveness of combat. Especially in some occupied areas in Europe, they have lost their country, have no light, and can only violate their hearts to strengthen the enemy's war machine under heavy coercion and threats. Then, using the first letter of this victory as a signal to spread, it will be like revealing the dawn in the dark night and obtaining sweet dew in thirst, which can revive the decline and awaken the yearning for new life. Therefore, for the same reason, on the west coast of the Pacific, where dark mists are low and new incidents are brewing, it is also necessary to vigorously promote this movement. The people of the Far East, for their own sake and for the sake of all mankind, are truly in need of an anti-aggression democratic victory.

Reviewing the recent international situation, it can be said that it is the most suitable time to universally promote the victory of democracy. Although in the Far East and on both sides of the Atlantic, there are still new adventurous attempts brewing, such as Vietnam, which has ignited a wildfire due to Vichy's unexpected concessions. How it will end is still difficult to predict; but in general, the period when the aggressor could boast the most has passed. Both in the east and west battlefields, they are in a situation where they cannot stop, and the recent efforts of the Soviet army to resist the Nazi offensive have made their blitzkrieg plan a complete illusion, which is even more of a precursor to the aggressor's defeat. The combined strength of the international anti-aggression front has far exceeded the strength of aggression, and they are currently actively engaged in preparing for a counter-offensive, both in the Far East and in Europe. Underestimating the strength of the other party is harmful, and rash optimism can sometimes lead to failure; the future duel is a difficult process that requires the greatest courage and strength to deal with. This is also the subtle meaning of the promoters of the V-for-Victory movement; but the victory of democracy, although not achievable overnight, is beyond doubt. The universality of the V-for-Victory movement throughout the world today is also a sign of the complete liberation of all mankind from the threat of aggression in the future.

### Japanese Landed Southwest of Chaoyang: Chinese Resistance Inflicted Heavy Casualties; Fierce Fighting in Zhengyang South; Chinese Troops in Guangdong and Hunan Reinforced to Strictly Prevent Japanese Offensive

Chongqing Military News: (1) A unit of Japanese infantry and artillery landed on the opposite shore of Haimen on the morning of the 20th, invaded Shalun (southwest of Chaoyang), and continued to advance towards the vicinity of Yanting. After Chinese troops resisted, they killed and wounded many Japanese soldiers. The two sides are still in a stalemate. (2) On the 16th, more than a thousand Japanese troops who attacked Qugang from the north of Yanghe again crossed the Huaihe River on the evening of the same day and attacked Xiaocaodian (south of Zhengyang County). They fought fiercely with the Chinese troops. By noon on the 18th, many Japanese soldiers had been killed. The Japanese are still surrounded by Chinese troops. (24th dispatch)

Hong Kong: Although various sources here publicize that the Japanese army in Guangdong is now being transferred to Manchuria to cope with new developments, the status and strength of the Japanese army in Guangdong have not changed. A certain officer of the Chinese army in Shaoguan told reporters that only the Japanese army vehicles stationed south of the Great Wall are returning to the north, but because no Japanese reinforcements have come to Guangdong, the Japanese army's strength in Guangdong has not changed. According to his estimate, there are currently about 70,000 Japanese troops in Guangdong, and he admitted that there are no major battles on any front at present. A certain Japanese lieutenant general Wei has arrived in Guangzhou to replace Konoe Atsushi as the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in South China. Konoe Atsushi has gone to Nanjing to serve as the chief of staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Army. At present, not only is Guangdong silent, but all fronts in mainland China are also peaceful. The Chinese intelligence office said that except for the Japanese army attacking Zhao'an Huanggang on the coast of southern Fujian, their subsequent actions still attempt to clear the Yuehan Road and open it from Yuezhou to Shijing. The Japanese chief of staff will formulate a plan to dispatch a sufficient number of troops to launch this offensive, because previous sporadic small battles have not brought any material gains to the Japanese army. Two Japanese divisions have long been stationed in the Guangzhou area, preparing to go north, and the Japanese army south of Yuezhou has recently conducted reconnaissance battles to test the strength of the Chinese army. Chongqing has ordered the troops in Hunan and Guangdong provinces to prevent this offensive and to cooperate closely. Chinese troops have also repeatedly attacked the Japanese army's outposts north of Guangzhou to probe the Japanese army's strength and prepare for a counter-offensive.

### Central Government Periodically Issues Food Treasury Bonds; Purchases 35 Million Shí of Grain; Grain Treasury Bonds Issued When Paying for Grain

Chongqing: According to reliable sources, the National Government will issue food treasury bonds on September 16. It is expected that the government will purchase 35 million shí of grain nationwide, with Sichuan Province supplying 12 million shí. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing: Minister of Food Xu Kan reported on the work of the ministry. After the full text was revised, it was published. Among them, the revised section on pricing and purchase stipulated that the government should set a uniform and reasonable price for purchase at face value, so as not to stimulate market prices due to government grain purchases. Moreover, food treasury bonds will be issued when paying the price. A general agreement has been reached with various provinces. The collection of in-kind land tax and pricing purchases can obtain about 40 to 50 million shí of rice and wheat, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the military and civilians for one year. According to the issue of food treasury bonds, it has been roughly determined to be 70%. The two provinces that produce the most rice are Sichuan and Hunan. The Sichuan Province method has been finalized in Chengdu by Liu Hangchen, Guan Jiyu, and others in consultation with Sichuan Province, and it has been decided that the levy will begin on September 16. The situation in Hunan Province is simpler, and Chairman Xue Yue has already made some headway. Therefore, Xu's report is full of optimistic tone. (23rd Havas dispatch)

### West Gong Banner of Urad League Holds Banner Affairs Conference; Guided by Chen Yujia and Disaster Relief Funds Issued; Mongolian Compatriots Are Very Concerned About the Great Cause of Resisting Japanese Aggression

Yulin: The West Gong Banner of Urad League held a Chugela Conference (i.e., Banner Affairs Conference) on the 15th in the Tongyilong area. Chen Yujia, commander of the Mongolian guerrilla army, and Qi Junfeng of West Gong Banner went to guide it. After the meeting, Commander Chen inspected the troops stationed in the Wolf Mountain area of Mongolia, and supervised the release of West Banner disaster relief funds. The disaster situation in West Gong Banner is quite serious. The central government's disaster relief funds are issued at 10 yuan per adult and 7 yuan per child. In addition, many Mongolian people in West Gong Banner who were coerced during the fall of Wuyuan last year have returned one after another after Qi Junfeng sent people to appease them. Recently, a group of people including Huertu Monk also fled back from Bailingmiao. Commander Chen convened Mongolian people and lamas everywhere he went during this inspection of Mongolia, telling them about the victorious future of resisting Japanese aggression and the central government's kindness to the Mongolian banners. The Mongolian compatriots were all overjoyed. Chen has now returned to western Sui and reported the process to Chairman Fu. It is decided that Fu will commend him. (23rd dispatch)

### Account of the Destruction of the Residence of the Publisher of the Hankou Chu Daily; Chinese Nanny and Cook Abducted; British Consul General Visited the Japanese Consul

Special dispatch from this port: According to recent news received here from Hankou, the incident in which the residence of Archibald, the publisher of the Chu Daily and the acting manager of Reuters, was destroyed occurred on the 1st of last week. According to witnesses, a truck loaded with striking workers from the Chu Daily and some Chinese people drove to the gate of the building. After getting off the truck, they held a demonstration outside the gate, posting leaflets. An Indian from the customs intended to investigate, but was surrounded and prevented from shouting. A group of rioters entered the building and went to Archibald's residence on the top floor, destroying all the objects in the house. Before leaving, they abducted a middle-aged Chinese nanny and a cook, and their whereabouts are still unknown. Reuters employees still cannot work due to intimidation, but did not participate in this action. It is said that several Japanese people in plain clothes came with the soldiers and immediately reported to the British Consul General Davidson. Later, Mr. Davidson visited the Japanese Consul General, and the British Vice Consul, White Lewis, notified the Chinese side of this matter. (Reuters)

### Vichy Concedes Japanese Occupation of Key Vietnamese Bases, Compromise Reached, Details Under Negotiation, French Spokesman Claims Temporary Measure

Vichy, 24th (United Press). A government spokesman announced yesterday that France had agreed to Japan's "temporary occupation" of key bases and airfields in French Indochina. The spokesman said the details of Japan's "defense" of Vietnam were being negotiated in Vichy and Hanoi. He insisted that the Japanese occupation was "only a temporary measure" to "protect Vietnam" from the alleged threat of attack by British, Free French, and Chinese forces. Meanwhile, Marshal Pétain stated in a speech in Aix-en-Provence that France "should defend the colonies needed by our neighboring countries." He added that colonies other than Syria were threatened, and France would "fight with the same spirit as in Syria to preserve the glory of France." American journalists questioned the Vichy spokesman, asking what had happened to France's promise to defend its empire without foreign assistance. The spokesman replied, "The events in Syria have prompted us to make an exception to this view." The American journalists then asked why Japan, and not the United States, had been invited to "defend" Vietnam. The spokesman replied, "We asked the United States a year ago what kind of assistance it would give to Vietnam, but we received no answer from Washington." He further stated that Japan's "protection" of Vietnam was "completely unrelated to the Tripartite Pact." He insisted that Japan had not issued an ultimatum, and Germany had not exerted any pressure. The spokesman said that Japan was requesting bases as a "temporary military measure to defend Vietnam against de Gaulle's China and Britain." The spokesman continued, "France believes that Japan's temporary occupation of Vietnamese military bases is conditional on not threatening Vietnam's integrity or French sovereignty, and therefore there is no particular inconvenience. Japan has made no territorial demands and only wishes to protect Vietnam. Chinese troops have been concentrated in Yunnan Province, and British land and air forces have also been concentrated in Burma and Malaya. Japan and France are deeply concerned that China and Britain may attempt to occupy Vietnam, and France cannot defend Vietnam alone, as proven in Syria. Japan's participation is within the scope of the 1940 treaty, which recognizes Japan's superior position in the Far East and its responsibility for maintaining peace in Asia."

London, 24th (Reuters). News of Japan's new demands on Vietnam has led to speculation about how the Vichy government will react. Rumors of a Japanese ultimatum and reports of Marshal Pétain reiterating Vichy's determination to defend the unity of French territory have coincided. It is not yet known whether Pétain's words are a consequence of the Syrian conflict or directed at Tokyo. Since the Franco-German armistice, the history of Japanese-Vietnamese relations has been a record of turbulence followed by concessions. On September 23 last year, French and Japanese forces clashed in Dong Dang, resulting in 131 Japanese deaths. Vichy Foreign Minister Baudouin described this as an isolated incident and explained the need to understand reality and recognize Japan's interests in establishing a new order in East Asia. Consequently, air bases north of Hanoi in Vietnam were given to Japan, allowing Japanese planes to bomb the Burma Road. During the Thai-Vietnamese conflict this year, the French put up a brief resistance, but it depleted some of the military supplies stored locally. Through Japanese arbitration, the Thai-Vietnamese hostilities ceased, and a portion of Vietnamese territory was awarded to Thailand by Japan. Shortly thereafter, a Japanese-Vietnamese trade agreement was established, and Vietnamese commerce was largely controlled by Japan. The discussions in newspapers in the occupied zone of France are noteworthy. On Tuesday morning, before Japan's new actions in Vietnam were widely known, a major Parisian newspaper published an article by its editor, Lü Chael, stating that since France did not have sufficient military means, it had to cooperate with Germany and obtain Japan's consent to defend its territory.

Washington, 24th (United Press). Yesterday, the Japanese Embassy here announced that it had received reports that Japan and Vichy had reached a mutual compromise on the Vietnam issue. However, the embassy had not yet received the detailed content of the compromise.

### Joint Sino-British Action on Vietnam Depends on British Request

Chongqing, 24th (United Press). A military spokesman stated today that the question of joint Sino-British action regarding the Japanese occupation of southern Vietnam depends on whether Britain requests it. The spokesman made this statement in response to inquiries about whether China and Britain were considering joint action. The spokesman emphasized that if China's borders were threatened, China would fight. When asked the same question yesterday, Yang Xuancheng (transliteration), director of the Army Intelligence Department, said that he could not elaborate on the matter. He also said that China's views remained consistent with those announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last year, when China stated that if Vietnam requested assistance, China would send troops into Vietnam. As informed sources understood that Vietnam was unlikely to make such a request, they believed that China's response to the Vietnam situation was to strengthen its border with Vietnam and fully cooperate with Britain. These sources also believed that Japan's move would drive China, Britain, and the United States into closer cooperation.

### Franco-Japanese Compromise Reached Several Days Ago, Content to Be Announced at End of Month

Washington, 24th (Reuters). It is reported that Japan and Vichy reached a compromise on July 19, but the details have not yet been finalized. At the same time, according to information obtained by diplomatic circles, the formal announcement will likely be around July 28, at which time the nature and extent of Vichy's concessions to Japan will be revealed.

London, 24th (Reuters). Vichy political circles deny the Washington report that Japan has issued an ultimatum to France regarding the military occupation of Vietnam.

London, 24th (Reuters). In the news broadcast on the German-controlled Paris radio station this morning, the situation in Vietnam was not mentioned. The fifteen-minute program was entirely devoted to domestic news and official announcements.

Tokyo, 24th (Reuters). Mr. Fang, the counselor of the French Embassy, met with Vice Minister Yamamoto this morning to discuss various issues related to Japanese-French relations.

### Reported that Governor of Vietnam and Sumita Discussing Implementation Plan of New Demands

Hanoi, 24th (Reuters). Governor of Vietnam, Decoux, and Sumita, the leader of the Japanese military mission, are currently discussing the implementation plan of Japan's demands on Vietnam, while awaiting new orders from their respective governments. Officials confirmed that the Japanese ambassador to Vichy requested the use of facilities in southern Vietnam, but the details are unknown.

Vichy, 24th (Reuters). Last night, a semi-official source here announced the Franco-Japanese talks, but did not mention the Japanese ultimatum regarding the Vietnam issue. It only stated that the talks, which began when Japanese Ambassador Kato visited Darlan twice, are now being continued by the Japanese diplomatic delegation in Vichy. At the same time, the Governor of Vietnam, Decoux, has met with Sumita, the leader of the Japanese mission, several times, and they are currently exchanging views within the framework of a previous Franco-Japanese agreement. Newspapers in the unoccupied zone of France have not yet commented on this issue.

### Japanese Ambassador to France, Kato, Met with Darlan Twice

Hanoi, 24th (Reuters). The Vietnam official news agency stated that Parisian newspapers are now advising the French government that if the situation becomes more complex, the danger to Vietnam will increase. The French government should be prepared, as the crisis in the Far East may be greater than that in the Near East. Since military plans are practically impossible, it is advisable to consult with Japan and adopt diplomatic plans to ensure the security of Vietnam. The news agency also confirmed the news that Japanese Ambassador Kato to Vichy had recently visited Darlan twice, and stated that Vietnamese-Japanese relations are determined by economic and political agreements, which are currently being fully implemented. The publication of such news by the official news agency clearly intends to prepare the Vietnamese people so that they will not be surprised when a new agreement is announced soon, granting Japan the use of facilities in southern Vietnam.

Singapore, 24th (Reuters). According to travelers arriving here, French merchant ships have not been allowed to leave Vietnamese ports for the past four or five days, for reasons unknown.

### U.S. Senate Discusses Extension of Military Service Act, U.S. Senators Believe International Situation Tense, Urge Immediate Passage of the Bill

Washington, 24th (Havas). According to informed sources, the Senate Military Affairs Committee will discuss today the proposal to authorize the government to send U.S. troops outside the Western Hemisphere. The bill advocates declaring a national emergency and granting military authorities all wartime powers, including a clause that would automatically extend the one-year term of compulsory military service.

Washington, 24th (United Press). Following Representative Mann of Kentucky, a Democrat, General Marshall, Chief of Staff, after obtaining confidential information from the Congressional Military Affairs Committee, declared that the current international situation "is becoming increasingly grave, far beyond what the public can understand, and its seriousness is increasing rapidly." Mann stated that the committee he is responsible for will support Marshall's request to declare a state of emergency and amend the Selective Service Act to extend the term of service to more than one year. Committee members reported that General Marshall's proposal has been submitted to the Executive Council, and it is guaranteed to be absolutely confidential. Marshall also publicly declared that it would be a great mistake by Congress to begin mobilizing military forces only in times of extreme emergency. However, at the same time, the Senate Military Affairs Committee continues to receive some arguments against extending the term of military service. Senator Reynolds of North Carolina, chairman of the committee, stated that the deadline for receiving opinions from all parties will be today, and the bill will be considered starting on Friday.

Washington, 24th (Reuters). Representative May, chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, stated last night after a meeting of the committee that the international situation is more serious than the public knows, and its seriousness is rapidly increasing.

### Reported Japanese Conducting Large-Scale Mobilization

Thousands are being drafted, and those previously considered unqualified are also receiving mobilization orders. Veteran soldiers from the war in China are being recalled to service.

### Fighting Resumes on Peru-Ecuador Border

Quito, 24th (International News Service). Fighting resumed yesterday on the Peru-Ecuador border along a twelve-mile front. Mediation efforts by sister nations have failed. The local gazette said Peruvian forces opened fire but were repelled to the Zarumilla River. Ecuadoran forces have seized the Peruvian outposts Aguas Verdes and Plachlo Loma. Radio reports said eight Peruvian aircraft attacked Puerto Bolivar.

Lima, 24th (International News Service). Authoritative sources here accused last night that the serious border conflict between Peru and Ecuador was instigated by the Nazis. The new clash is said to be part of a Nazi plan to create disputes in Latin America.

### Argentina Searches Nazi Organizations

Buenos Aires, 24th (United Press). Yesterday, members of the Davelda Committee (Argentina's counterpart to the Dies Committee, dedicated to investigating misconduct) searched a prominent Nazi headquarters with the assistance of seventy police officers, seizing documents in the hope of obtaining evidence of Nazi infiltration in Argentina and proving that local Nazis were linked to the recently suppressed Bolivian rebellion.

### Fierce Battles in Bessarabia, Annihilation, Great War Enters 33rd Day, Germany Still Fails to Crush Soviet Resistance

Moscow, 24th (TASS). There were fierce battles last night and this morning in Bokov, Smolensk, Polotsk, Novoriel, and Demimier. There were no major battles in other areas. Our air force fiercely bombed enemy motorized divisions.

Moscow, 24th (TASS). The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report for the night of the 23rd, stating that there were fierce battles during the day in Polotsk Novoriel, Smolensk, Zhitomir, and Bessarabia. In Bessarabia, our troops annihilated an enemy motorized unit and captured 400 trucks, 300 motorcycles, 2 armored vehicles, 25 cannons, and 8 mortars. Our air force is concentrating on bombing enemy motorized units, mechanized units, and airfields.

New York, 24th (United Press). On the 33rd day of fighting along a lengthy front line, the startling German group offensive has begun to gradually force the Soviet army to retreat, but Hitler's massive military machine has not yet been able to crush Soviet resistance. Moscow sources said that the German army's four-pronged advance has not diminished, with one route attempting to encircle Leningrad. The great battle of Smolensk has continued for the past two weeks, but as of yesterday, there had been no major changes to the forward positions. Moscow's communique stated that strong German forces were attacking the Pothrowa Dwesk district, east of Lake Doga.

### Soviet Offense and Defense Combined, German Forces Attacked from Front and Rear

London, 24th (Reuters). The remarks made by the German radio announcer while "explaining the German High Command's communique" on Wednesday night are quite meaningful. It is said that the Eastern European campaign is different from the Western European campaign because in Western Europe the enemy soldiers were aware that their resistance was futile, while the Soviet soldiers "combined offense and defense, creating unexpected precedents." Soviet soldiers would rather be killed at their posts than surrender, so although their deaths are extremely tragic, relatively few Soviet soldiers have been captured so far. German forces will be attacked from the front and the rear. To control this new type of warfare, two qualities are required: the soldier's courage to move forward and the general's appropriate command. The German side must know how to help itself and turn the difficult situation to the benefit of the German army. The announcer then described an example of the southern battle, saying that although the German army on the southern route had encountered great difficulties due to the unstable terrain, it was still slowly advancing.

Moscow, 24th (Reuters). German propaganda and the German High Command communique both stated that German forces had occupied Smolensk, a key city on the central front of the Soviet Union, last Wednesday. However, reporters heard from responsible sources that the city is still in the hands of Soviet forces and has not been lost to date. The German vanguard did reach the outskirts of the city several days ago, but it has been driven back. Qualified observers now have the impression that the second major offensive launched by the main German forces towards Smolensk is currently facing strong Soviet resistance. Furthermore, the routes have been extended, supplies have become increasingly difficult, and they are being effectively harassed by Soviet guerrillas, resulting in exhaustion. In addition, the Soviet army has set up many obstacles on the roads from Smolensk to Moscow. Although these obstacles inevitably slightly hinder Soviet traffic to the front lines, they can be seen as one of the reasons why the German army is beginning to realize that a frontal attack on Moscow has no hope of success. Therefore, the German side is now making excuses to the German people, saying that the purpose of the German army is to "destroy the Soviet army" and then seize Moscow. The situation in the Leningrad region is less clear. However, the Soviet side believes that it is extremely difficult for the German army to break through the fortified Karelian Isthmus and the rugged terrain around Lake Ladoga. Only an invasion from the southwest can threaten Leningrad, but the main Soviet forces in the area are currently firmly defending around Pskov, and the coastal areas between Pskov and Leningrad, as well as between Tallinn and Leningrad, have many forests and swamps and few roads, making it difficult to march.

### Soviet Reinforcements Arrive in Leningrad, German Advance Slows

Berlin, 24th (United Press). Well-informed German sources acknowledged last night that the Nazi advance on Leningrad has slowed down because the Soviet High Command has sent large reinforcements to join the battle.

Berlin, 24th (International News Service). It was announced last night that German forces have reached the Leningrad area from the southwest. The Soviet rearguard in the area has been forced to surrender, handing over a forest. Odessa was subjected to a lightning air raid, resulting in "terrible explosions and fires." German planes destroyed a train west of Moscow and bombed Soviet forces on the northwest shore of Lake Peipus.

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency). Military officials declared that German heavy artillery fiercely bombarded a dense forest near Leningrad, which was occupied by Soviet rear forces. Shells rained down, and the entire forest was engulfed in flames. Shortly thereafter, 26 Soviet soldiers surrendered to German forces.

Stockholm, 24th (Reuters). The Afunden newspaper's Helsinki dispatch stated that the German-Finnish forces departing from Salla are rapidly advancing and have crossed the swamp. The German-Finnish forces are clearly advancing towards Kandalaksha, all to cut off Soviet communications with Murmansk. It is believed that the attacking army is now within forty-five miles of Kandalaksha.

Helsinki, 23rd (Havas). Officials announced that the coastal city of Kotka in our south was again bombed by Soviet aircraft today. Five Soviet aircraft were shot down by our side.

### German Aircraft Carry Out Third Air Raid on Soviet Capital

Moscow, 24th (TASS). Last night, 150 enemy planes attempted to raid the Soviet capital for the third time, but were unsuccessful. Soviet planes intercepted and anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely. As a result, only eight to ten enemy planes broke through into the city's airspace. There was absolutely no damage to military targets. There were slight casualties among the public. Several German planes were shot down, but the number is unknown. There were no losses on the Soviet side.

Moscow, 24th (TASS). During the German air raid, the people of Moscow showed great composure and courage. In one area, German planes dropped 200 incendiary bombs, and the resulting fires were extinguished by firefighting teams organized by the public.

Stockholm, 23rd (Havas). The Moscow radio station has just broadcast news that Moscow was heavily bombed by German aircraft last night, resulting in many civilian deaths and injuries. The Red Army headquarters was also damaged, and one bomb fell near a hospital in the Kremlin, killing 80 civilians and injuring hundreds.

Berlin, 24th (United Press). According to the German official news agency, German planes dropped a large number of bombs and 10,000 incendiary bombs on Moscow on Tuesday night. It also stated that German aircrews saw major fires in twenty locations.

Rome, 24th (United Press). A Berlin special correspondent for the Roman People's Daily described the first German bombing of Moscow yesterday, stating that German aircrews were forced to wear oxygen masks during the operation to cope with Soviet air defenses. When German planes approached Moscow, they flew high into the clouds because Moscow's barrage balloons posed a great danger to the attacking planes, as everyone knows. At the same time, the Soviet Union had also concentrated its large number of anti-aircraft weapons in Moscow. However, German planes still took the opportunity to drop a large number of bombs and incendiary bombs, causing large fires. It is evident from the fact that German aircrews had to wear oxygen masks that the air raid was carried out at a very high altitude.

### Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Claims Germany Conducting Chemical Warfare; Publicly Announces German Order to Use Poison Gas; Hitler Breaks Treaties and is Not Concerned About Excuses

TASS, Moscow, 24th - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky yesterday told foreign journalists, "The purpose of today's special meeting is to inform you of a special document obtained by our Red Army on July 15 when it defeated the Second Battalion of the German 52nd Chemical Regiment. Two points are noteworthy: (1) This order was issued on June 11, eleven days before the German attack on the Soviet Union; (2) The document number we obtained is 4322, indicating the wide distribution of this order. The order states that German troops must use poison gas preemptively, and must also take the Red Army by surprise and use poison gas on a large scale. Regarding this point, the original text of the order is as follows: (Article 10) Chemical warfare weapons can only succeed when used on a large scale. The use of a small amount of chemical weapons will never be effective. (Article 11) The firing of chemical bullets should take the opponent by surprise, especially since the enemy has good anti-gas equipment. In addition, two other attached orders fully demonstrate that the German high command has decided to conduct chemical warfare against the Soviet Union. The German side has prepared various new types of poison gas bombs, ready to launch a surprise gas attack. Moreover, after the German gas bombs are launched, the poisoning time of their destinations is quite long. All of this proves that Germany has violated the international agreements it signed. However, given Germany's habit of tearing up treaties, Hitler is not concerned about finding excuses to shirk responsibility and justify himself. In any case, bombs and poison gas cannot shake the Soviet people's determination to fight for independence and freedom. We have nerves of steel. If the facts require it, we can fight for a long time to bury the fascist bandits in the artillery fire they have caused and drown them in the blood they have shed." After finishing his speech, he distributed photographs of the German documents to the foreign journalists.

### Two Soviet Military Representatives Return to England; Expected to Meet with Eden

Reuters, London, 24th - Lieutenant General Golikov and Colonel Telegin, members of the Soviet military mission, returned to London last night after reporting everything to the Soviet government in Moscow. Subsequently, Soviet Ambassador Maisky, accompanied by Lieutenant General Golikov and Admiral Kharlamov, met with British Foreign Secretary Eden to discuss matters.

### American Fleet Prepared; Military Developments in the Far East; Governor of Rangoon Distributes Order to Organize National Defense Forces; Thai Prime Minister Reiterates Determination to Maintain Strict Neutrality

United Press, Washington, 24th - Secretary of the Navy Knox stated yesterday that he had anticipated Japan's actions in the Far East, but the U.S. Navy is also fully prepared. Knox stated that he did not know the direction of Japan's actions, but the position of the U.S. Navy will realize the United States' policy towards the Far East when necessary. He also stated, "I believe this is unquestionable. If Japan wants to implement its current plan, although we do not know whether it is north or south, there will be a possibility of war." Knox indicated that he had received many accurate reports from various sources that imminent military developments are occurring in the Far East.

Havas, Washington, 23rd - Well-informed sources here say that the U.S. government plans to send a note to the Japanese government requesting it to explain its military intentions regarding the new situation in the Far East.

Havas, Washington, 23rd - Political figures say that the situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense in the past 24 hours. However, if Japan takes military action against the coastal provinces of the Soviet Union or British territories in southern Asia, the result will not only be war with Britain, but also the risk of war with the United States.

Reuters, Rangoon, 24th - The Governor of Rangoon has issued an order to organize national defense forces.

Reuters, Singapore, 24th - A battalion of British troops, recently transferred from Shanghai to Singapore, reached Singapore after walking through dense forests and beaches from the north, covering 110 miles in seven days, to train in defending the coast and fighting in the forest. According to the commander, it is not easy for the enemy to attempt to land.

United Press, Tokyo, 24th - The well-known business newspaper Chugai Shogyo Shimpo carried a special dispatch from Shanghai today, stating that Britain and the United States have agreed to jointly defend the Far East and India. The British are now selling off all their industries in China, as this is the best opportunity to sell. The newspaper stated that the U.S. and Britain have agreed to jointly defend Singapore, Rangoon, Bombay, and Calcutta, with Lashio in Burma as the hub of their defense. Chinese troops have concentrated on the Burmese border, preparing to put pressure on Thailand.

Reuters, Bangkok, 24th - Thai Prime Minister Sangkram last night firmly declared Thailand's determination to maintain strict neutrality when sending a Thai delegation to Battambang to receive the Vietnamese territory ceded in accordance with the Tokyo Treaty. At a time when the situation in the Far East is tense and the world is speculating about Japan's intentions towards Thailand and Vietnam, people are paying special attention to the Thai Prime Minister's recent remarks explaining his foreign policy.

### Leaders of Shanghai and Hong Kong Business and Industry Go to the Mainland to Develop Industry; Shanghai Factories Move Inward for Production; Laying a Permanent Foundation with Optimistic Prospects

Since the August 13th Shanghai Battle, factories in Shanghai have successively suspended operations and shut down. Due to the harsh environment and difficulties in development, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency recently learned from the industrial community in Shanghai that there are many hidden worries about the future of Shanghai industry due to environmental factors. Currently, they are doubly feeling the lack of raw materials and power, transportation difficulties, and economic oppression. Therefore, general manufacturers have moved inward separately to seek future development. It is also learned that leaders of various industries have successively left Shanghai and gone to various industrial areas in the mainland to negotiate the establishment of factories in the mainland, in order to achieve rapid industrial advancement. According to a certain industrial leader, "The foundation of our country's industry has been laid in the arduous war, and the future is very optimistic."

Our Country's Industrial Future is Optimistic

The reporter also learned from another source that the movement to increase industrial production in the mainland is just beginning to make rapid progress. The government's assistance to industrial development and the industrial community's concerted efforts to seek progress are all spare no effort. It is learned that heavy industries in the mainland, such as oil refining, steel, and machinery, are being actively strengthened. Light industries are focusing on meeting needs and striving to increase the production of chemical and brewing industries. The increase in the number of privately-owned textile, paper, and leather industries is particularly impressive. Currently, the industrial communities of Shanghai and Hong Kong have united to strive for the scientification of mainland industry in order to facilitate a protracted war. Therefore, the future of our country's industry is very optimistic.

Striving to Promote Investment and Develop the Southwest

Since the outbreak of the war, the important industrial areas of Central and Northern China have successively become battlefields. The industries and businesses in these areas have suffered severe blows. As of now, they have successively moved into the provinces and cities of Sichuan and Yunnan to continue to increase production and shipment of goods. After the war, the railways and highways of Sichuan-Yunnan, Xukun, and Yunnan-Burma were built rapidly, and the abundant resources of the inland provinces are enough to promote the concept of investment and development of the Southwest. The economic and industrial circles are particularly determined to carry out this plan, sparing no effort, and this has a great relationship to this. It is now learned that leaders of the Shanghai industrial community in the mainland, such as Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and Luo Qinghua, are striving to promote investment by the Shanghai industrial community to jointly develop the Southwest.

Foreigners Enjoy Using Chinese National Goods

Although factories in various industries in this city have some difficulties in development due to environmental factors, they have all improved their various products. They all believe that cutting corners is a way to cut off their own path. All kinds of products are now valued by foreigners. Therefore, foreigners are happy to purchase exquisite national goods. The goods they need are listed as follows: cotton and silk fabrics, porcelain, glassware, metal products, chemicals, canned food, candy, grass boards, raw silk rayon, socks, barber supplies, ivoryware, camphor powder, mats, truck parts, paint, rubber products, carpets, fountain pens, bricks and tiles, woolen fabrics, paper stationery, suitcases, lathes, industrial machinery, lace, accessories, shoes, clocks, pottery, velvet, saws, buttons, needles, razor blades, novelties, etc.

### French Ambassador Cosme Leaves Shanghai by Plane

French Ambassador to China Cosme, who has been in Shanghai for several months, left Shanghai by plane for Beidaihe on the morning of the 23rd to escape the summer heat.

Havas, Beiping, 23rd - French Ambassador to China Cosme arrived here by plane yesterday afternoon from Shanghai.

### Anyone Manipulating Rice and Coal Will Be Punished According to Regulations; No Favoritism Regardless of Familiarity; Hope for Cooperation with the Authorities in This Regard

Rice and coal are essential necessities for citizens every day. The authorities of the two concessions will take effective measures to continue to suppress and stabilize their prices, and will never allow any merchants to manipulate, monopolize, raise prices, and profit. The authorities will also adhere to their original intention and assist merchants in purchasing large quantities of rice and coal from abroad to be sold in Shanghai. It is hoped that merchants will cooperate with the authorities in this regard. If they dare to take the opportunity to cause trouble again, once the investigation is verified, regardless of whether they are officials or civilians, no favoritism will be shown, and they will be severely punished without exception in accordance with the established regulations. It is well known that rice and coal are essential necessities for residents every day. Their high prices have a profound impact on social order. Speculative rice merchants who engage in illegal activities, create rumors, and fabricate facts will be arrested.

### Public Works Department's Collection of Business Tax Clearly Conflicts with National Tax; Chinese Side Expresses Solemn Views; Implementation Will Further Increase Business Difficulties

Because the Public Works Department of the Public Concession is unable to make ends meet financially, the Tax Reform Committee has suggested implementing a special business tax to make up for the deficit. If this new tax is implemented, the Public Works Department will issue a formal report to explain the scope of the tax. However, the general merchants have been deeply concerned since hearing this news. They all believe that current prices are high and citizens' purchasing power has been drastically reduced. If a new tax is added, it will greatly affect the market and increase difficulties. Some Chinese people hold solemn opposing views, believing that business taxes, such as tobacco and alcohol taxes, are a violation of the Chinese tax system if collected by a third party beyond their authority. Therefore, they sincerely hope that the Public Works Department will not implement this new tax, and believe that financial difficulties should still be addressed through thrift or by finding other legitimate sources of tax revenue.

Finance Committee Will Review

The Public Works Department held its last meeting before the summer vacation at 4:30 pm the day before yesterday, discussing the proposal to levy a special business tax and the proposal of the Water and Fire Company to voluntarily reduce the special surcharge by 36%. The proposal of the Water and Fire Company was approved and will be implemented from August. Due to the importance of the business tax issue, it was decided to submit it to the Finance Committee for review before submitting it for discussion again, and to solicit the opinions of taxpayers. Therefore, its implementation date will be postponed. It is widely rumored that the tax measures are: (1) Various industrial and commercial enterprises will be taxed approximately 10% on their business income of 3,000 yuan or more, and an average of 8% on income above 3,000 yuan. (2) Exchanges, trading houses, pawnshops, etc. will be taxed 15% on their business income of 3,000 yuan or more, and an average of 10% on income above 3,000 yuan. Those with income less than 3,000 yuan will be exempt from tax in consideration of the livelihood of the common people and to avoid stimulating price increases.

### Place Names Printed on Stamps in Five Provinces Not Approved by the Directorate General of Posts

Since the Beiping Post Office printed place names on stamps in the five provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Northern Jiangsu, the Shanghai Post Office has also received mail affixed with these place name stamps. In view of the special circumstances in North China, they are still delivered as usual. However, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the Directorate General of Posts in Kunming has not approved this measure by the Beiping Post Office.

### Foreign Passengers to Japan Prevented from Boarding; Visas Temporarily Revoked and Fares Refunded; Nagasaki, Kobe, and Yokohama All Prohibited; However, the Japanese Consulate Announced Yesterday Denying This

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Japanese ship Kobe Maru left Shanghai for Japan this morning (the 24th). Foreign passengers who wanted to take the ship to Japan were suddenly prevented from boarding this morning, as the Japanese side has implemented a new regulation prohibiting any nationals of third countries from going to Japan or Dalian.

Except for Chinese, All Are Prohibited from Going

According to the new regulations, any foreigner other than Chinese is prohibited from going to Japan. It is said that Germans, Italians, and other Axis nationals are also subject to this regulation. Foreigners who were prevented from departing on the Kobe Maru this morning had all obtained the necessary visas and purchased tickets, but the Japanese side suddenly issued an order to revoke their visas and refund their fares. All foreigners who want to go to Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, and Dalian are within the scope of the ban. The Japanese side has not specified the duration of this ban.

Foreigners Residing in Japan Find It Difficult to Return

The Kobe Maru departed at 9:30 this morning, carrying only 500 Chinese and Japanese passengers. It is said that foreigners residing in Japan who are currently in Shanghai will try to obtain permission to return to Japan. So far, there are no exceptions to the Japanese ban. Therefore, unless the regulations are amended, some foreigners residing in Tokyo, Osaka, and other Japanese cities who have come to Shanghai for travel or business will not be able to return home. It is said that the Japanese ban does not apply to Qingdao. Those who want to go to Qingdao to escape the summer heat can still go. It was also learned at 2:30 this afternoon that foreign passengers who had previously purchased tickets to Nagasaki or Kobe will be allowed to travel on Japanese ships. However, the Japanese side is no longer selling tickets.

Japanese Consulate Announces No Restrictions

Yesterday, the Japanese Consulate announced that foreign nationals who wish to depart for Japan can still obtain passports and tickets. The Shanghai Nippon Yusen Kaisha (Japan Mail Steamship Company) also sold tickets to foreign nationals who have passports and various documents as usual yesterday. The Dalian Kisen Kaisha (Dalian Steamship Company) also did not refuse to sell tickets to Dalian and Qingdao yesterday. It is said that the reason why the Kobe Maru, Taiyo Maru, and Nagasaki Maru, which belong to the Toa Kaiun (East Asia Shipping Company), refused to allow foreigners to board was an order from the Tokyo head office and was purely an internal company matter. It is also learned that the Japanese shipping companies ordered not to announce sailing dates from the 22nd include Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Toa Kaiun, Osaka Shosen Kaisha (Osaka Merchant Shipping Co.), and Dalian Kisen Kaisha.

### Continuing to Promote Savings to Foster a Trend

The National Savings Association for National Reconstruction has been established for a year. Although Shanghai residents face special circumstances, the response has been very enthusiastic. Especially during various commemorative festivals, all sectors have vigorously promoted savings, with remarkable results. In view of the fact that savings for national reconstruction benefit both individuals and the country, and Shanghai is full of idle funds, it has been decided to continue to actively promote savings to foster a trend of thrift and savings habits, and to increase social economy and national reconstruction power.

### Hamilton House Also Sold; Acquired by a British National

Hamilton House, a British property located on the Bund in Guangdong Road, covering an area of approximately 3.24 acres, was sold by the Protectorate Fire Insurance Company to the Mercantile Bank yesterday for a price of £80,000, equivalent to approximately 6 million Chinese yuan. The acquirer is still a British national. This proves that British nationals in Shanghai still have confidence in their future business.

### President of the Power Company Talks About Conserving Fuel; Difficulty in Obtaining Oil; Electricity Must Be Saved; Philippines and United States Will Stop Supplying Shanghai with Fuel Oil

The Shanghai Times reported that Mr. Hopkins, president of the Shanghai Power Company, told reporters yesterday (the 23rd) that Shanghai has been fortunate to receive fuel supplies for the past four months to compensate for the shortage of coal. However, the world is currently in turmoil, and countries are either at war or in a state of emergency. Shanghai, although it has obtained fuel, must save electricity consumption. When can it be relaxed? It depends on the results of consultations between the Shanghai Power Company and government officials of various countries.

Fuel Supply Already Difficult

The governments of all countries are indeed concerned about maintaining the current state of Shanghai and do not believe that they will disregard the legitimate needs of the city. From this perspective, he has hope for the future. However, from other aspects, there are still many difficulties. The Shanghai Power Company has just learned that fuel oil supplied by the Philippines and the United States will be stopped because oil tankers have stopped running. The supply of fuel oil from the United States and the Philippines has been of great help to the Shanghai Power Company in the past four months.

More Ships Sunk Than Replenished

Currently, more ships are sunk in the Atlantic than are replenished. The British and American governments will naturally use every ship they can acquire. Even in the highly developed and wealthiest United States, gasoline consumption is now restricted due to the lack of oil tankers, and it is difficult to purchase new cars. Now Shanghai only needs money to be able to purchase the gasoline and the latest cars it needs. Although there are few ships, copper and other raw materials are still imported. But it would be short-sighted to think that this can be maintained for a long time.

Shanghai Life Depends on Supply

The future of various aspects of life in Shanghai depends on consultations between the Power Company and government officials of various countries. It is hoped that the cessation of the supply of fuel oil and other developments will not seriously affect the prosperity here. Shanghai has proven its amazing resilience to various blows, so he is not pessimistic about the future of Shanghai. But there is no denying that Shanghai will need to be more thrifty.

### Yesterday Morning's Thunderstorm Turned Roads into Rivers; Violent Thunder and Inverted Tides Severely Impacted Public Transportation

Yesterday morning in this city, a thunderstorm broke out with the force of a stampede of ten thousand horses, unprecedented in recent years. Combined with the tide flowing backward, water accumulated and was difficult to drain, causing the low-lying roads in both concessions to become a vast expanse of water. Transportation was greatly hindered. According to information obtained from the Xujiahui Observatory, the thunderstorm was most severe from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM. The rain stopped at 8:00 AM, with a total rainfall of 111.2 centimeters. The intensity was rare. It occurred during office hours, when vehicles were scarce, and rickshaw pullers were raising their prices significantly, profiting threefold.

Sudden High Tide

From midnight to 4:00 AM yesterday, the Huangpu River experienced a high tide. The Huangpu Conservancy Bureau predicted it would reach eleven feet. Due to wind and rain, the tide was stirred up, reaching an actual level of twelve feet six inches, leaving only four inches from the Bund's riverbank. The tide began to land in low-lying areas along the river, flooding the banks. The roads, unable to drain the accumulated rainwater, were further inundated by the high tide flowing back through the sewers, exacerbating the situation. Everywhere, the roads were flooded.

Transportation Disrupted: Trolleys and trams on Public Concession Routes 1, 2, 3, and 5 were temporarily suspended. French Concession trams were also completely stopped. Routes 17 and 18, connecting the two concessions, only operated to their respective boundaries. Telephone and electric wires suffered damage from the heavy rain, and workers braved the rain to repair them.

Clear Skies Expected: According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the weather in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, including Nanjing, Hankou, Wuhu, and Anqing, was clear and pleasant. Therefore, the heavy rain in this city was purely a thunderstorm. Clear skies are expected today. Furthermore, another high tide is expected in the Huangpu River at 2:00 PM today.

### Children Playing in Water Arrested and Reprimanded

Yesterday morning, this city was hit by sudden strong winds and heavy rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning. The downpour was unprecedented, ceasing around 10:00 AM, but light rain persisted. By evening, the sky began to clear slightly. After the torrential rain, low-lying roads accumulated water, turning into rivers, with a vast expanse of water everywhere. All trams were suspended, including trolleybuses on Route 24, due to the deep water in the Avenue Albert area. Other routes continued to operate as usual. Avenue Joffre and Route Massenet in the French Concession were a vast expanse of water. Consequently, many children were playing in the water, even throwing water at pedestrians, causing resentment. The French police, aware of this, dispatched trucks with detectives to arrest children engaging in mischief in the water along the way. They were taken back to the police station, reprimanded, and then released to their families as a deterrent. It is reported that over a hundred children were arrested at one point.

Fortunately, the detectives were agile and avoided the attack. Both were taken to the police station and escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that the defendants' case required detailed investigation and requested an adjournment. After questioning by Judge Huang Risheng, the court ordered them to be detained for a further hearing.

### Shanghai Orphanage Publishes Current Situation; Hopes Great Benefactors Will Give Generously

The Shanghai Orphanage was founded 36 years ago. Over the years, it has raised more than 4,000 male and female orphans. More than 200 people have graduated from elementary school and entered junior and senior high schools and universities, and more than 3,000 people have served in all walks of life, which has won the approval of society. Recently, due to increasingly tight economic conditions, it is appealing to all sectors of society and philanthropists to generously help so that the orphans in the orphanage can be maintained. The Guanghua News Agency reporter visited Zhang Jifu, the person in charge of the orphanage, and learned about the current situation as follows:

Current Situation: Since the beginning of the war, it has led more than 180 male and female orphans (more than 400 other orphans were either taken back by their families or introduced to occupations on their behalf) to

seek refuge in Mengjiang Hall on Avenue du Roi Albert in the French Concession. It has been almost four years now. The hall is an old-fashioned bungalow with low terrain, narrow and damp. It is a two-厢房 with a patio (with a canopy above), where they sleep, eat, work, wash, cook, meet guests, work and rest all under the canopy. Recently, the abbot of the hall has forced them to move, using various methods to treat them. The situation is unspeakable. They are now planning to find a house to move to. If anyone has a suitable house, please let them know. If you can help them find a way, they would be extremely grateful. There are currently 150 male and female orphans aged 8 to 18 years. There is a complete six-year elementary school with six grades. The upper half of the day is for grades 1, 3, and 5, and the lower half of the day is for grades 2, 4, and 6. The middle and high grades are single-style, and the lower grades are complex-style. In terms of crafts, due to the narrow space, it is not convenient to distribute them as before. Only light handicrafts are now carried out in each workshop. They are divided into morning and afternoon shifts. There are currently three teachers, two volunteer teachers, one staff member who is also a teacher, three staff members, and three nannies. The orphanage has always had no foundation and property, and relies entirely on the donations of major philanthropists. The losses are divided into annual donations, special donations, music donations, and assistance from the Shanghai Refugee Association. Recently, the economic sources have decreased rather than increased (the reason is that most major philanthropists have shifted their funds to other charitable causes, and some have also left Shanghai). Therefore, the economic situation is becoming increasingly tight. Recently, prices have soared, and the expenses have become even more critical. The monthly regular expenses are about 2,450 yuan, and the average monthly cost per person is less than 17 yuan. The annual expenses are more than 40,000 yuan. There are still many orphans and children who are helpless and constantly come to the orphanage to request care. Due to limited economic resources, housing, and inadequate facilities, they cannot be satisfied. They hope that major philanthropists will generously help and provide a steady stream of assistance so that the orphans can have warmth and food. They are deeply grateful. (Guanghua News Agency)

### Securities Strained Far East Situation New York Stock Market Fluctuations Sharp Government Bond Market Spot Goods Sell-Off Heavy

Government bonds in the grey market saw another downturn yesterday. Major players were exiting, and a large quantity of spot goods were being sold off. Market sentiment remained weak, and many were seeking ways to escape. While there was some short covering, it was not enough to offset the sell-off. Rumors circulated that the principal and interest would be reduced to account for the exchange rate difference between Chongqing and Shanghai, and that payment would be delayed by a month. Whether this is true remains to be seen, and an announcement is expected by the end of the month. Where there is smoke, there is fire, and these rumors likely have some basis. The recent downward trend suggests that each decline will uncover a new low. Therefore, any rally will likely be brief. Yesterday morning, Xie Xing Yuan, Xinfu, He Feng, and Hong Da were mostly long positions exiting, in large quantities. The Northern Syndicate No. 14 also sold heavily. Yitai added to its long positions, while Hengfu covered slightly. Dahua Runli bought ninety percent of the shares. However, supply and demand were imbalanced, and Class C shares fell below the 70 yuan mark again. The midday closing price was down seven or eight cents. In the afternoon, Hong Da, He Feng, Xie Xing Yuan, and Xinfu continued selling. Lian He and Yitai added to their long positions again. Ren Feng and Run De also bought in. At that time, the low price of Class C shares was 68.70 yuan. Later, Hu He Ji, Gong Mao, Ji Sheng, and others also bought in. Jiu Feng, Tong Shun, Ding Kang, and Heng Kang sold off again. The price rose briefly by four or five cents, but at the close, it fell back by two or three cents. The market situation remained volatile and unsettled. As a result, except for Class D shares, which did not trade at all, the rest fell by six and a half cents to one cent and one dime. The transaction volume was approximately 2.4 to 2.5 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

Stock trading saw 500 shares of China National Underwear Company traded at a price of 10.05 yuan per share.

Although the public industrial stock market showed a downward trend, the situation was still relatively active. Cultivation shares bucked the trend and rose. Opening at only 30.75 yuan, they climbed to 33.25 yuan at the close. Xiangtai shares were also firm, while rubber shares were quiet.

Japan dared to occupy Vietnam, presumably because it believed that Britain and the United States would not take significant action. However, in the New York market, shares of companies producing goods from the Far East were strong, fearing that supplies would be cut off. According to the United Press of America's dispatch from New York on the 24th, the tense situation in the Far East caused the local stock market to fluctuate sharply. Trading volume was low. Prices fluctuated greatly at the opening, but stabilized somewhat by the close. However, trading in automobiles and copper remained slow. Sugar and gasoline were firm, while railway and rubber were stable. Aircraft and film rose sharply.

The 1899 China Guan Nei Wai Railway 5% Bonds (i.e., the Bei Ning Railway Bonds) will make its 37th principal payment of £57,500 and the 84th interest payment of £5,750, both totaling £63,250, on August 1st. Sangyou London HSBC Bank announced that payments will be made on schedule. Hua Chang Yanghang's Shenjia Gala Oak Company Limited resolved at the shareholders' meeting on the 15th of this month to pay a final dividend of 9 cents per share, effective immediately. Aiyataihua Oak Company Limited also set an interim dividend of 5 cents per share, payable on August 2nd.

London, 23rd (Wednesday) dispatch: Today, Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British companies' stock market listings remained flat. There were no changes in market conditions.

### Finance Attention to British and American Attitudes Toward Japan's Southern Advance Foreign Exchange Speculation Hesitant

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed exchange rates. The grey market for British exchange remained very stable, while the US dollar was stable with a slight easing. It was reported that Japan had issued a note to the Vietnamese authorities, making demands as a starting point for its southern advance. Chinese merchants once aggressively offered August US dollars at 5.375 yuan, but found it difficult to sell. Upon hearing rumors of Vietnam's capitulation, the easing stopped and recovered slightly. The afternoon was stagnant, and no transactions were heard. Ultimately, British exchange remained flat, while the US dollar eased slightly. Trading volume was light throughout the day, as the indecisiveness of British and American strategies in response to Japan's southern advance caused speculators to hesitate.

British Exchange Flat, US Dollar Slightly Easier

According to morning telegrams, the silver market was flat. Exchange rates of various countries against the US dollar rose by two cents in Shanghai, while the rest remained flat. The central exchange rate listings remained unchanged. Domestic banks opened with flat selling prices for spot goods. British gold was 3 pence 234375, and the US dollar was 5.3125 yuan. Chinese merchants and speculators initially released their holdings, making it difficult to sell even at 5.3475 yuan. Foreign banks showed little appetite, with the lowest price at 5.375 yuan. HSBC's listed exchange rates were all flat. The silver equalization tax remained at 24.25%. Foreign banks showed slightly better interest, stabilizing after the easing. Foreign banks absorbed August exchange at 5.34375 yuan from Chinese banks, slightly tightening. It was reported that a certain American bank absorbed less. However, by midday, 5.34375 yuan could still be settled. British gold was 3 pence 234375. The afternoon market remained stagnant, and no transactions were heard. The market closed at 3:30 PM with British gold at 3 pence 234375 and the US dollar at 5.34375 yuan, which was flat for British exchange and a rise of 0315 for the US dollar compared to the previous midday close.

### Gold Market Repeated Advances and Retreats

Yesterday, the gold market in the spot and grey markets continued to decline, but on the same day, it turned into a meandering situation, hovering around the 6,500 yuan mark. Several attempts to break through were immediately reversed. Although Japan had launched its southern advance, the details of the joint British and American response were unclear, causing short sellers to be hesitant. Furthermore, rumors that Vietnam had capitulated led Heng Ji and Yi Da, with the assistance of Lide, to establish the Thai Gold Company. Although there was enthusiasm, the remittance merchants among the securities firms leaned towards selling. Therefore, several retreats to 6,495 or 6,496 yuan were immediately reversed, reaching as high as 6,524 yuan, ultimately settling with a small premium of 31 yuan. The total trading volume was 80,000 to 90,000 taels. The swap rate (July to August) remained at 45 yuan paid by the seller to the buyer. Cash remained stable. Shi He advanced and Yong Cheng advanced 10 taels, He Sheng advanced 10 taels, priced at 7,120 yuan. Furthermore, Jin Hong Qing Yong advanced 60 taels for 7,130 yuan. In the afternoon, there was demand for full supply at the above prices, and the price rose by several yuan. Ornamental gold remained flat.

Ultimately Settling with a Small Premium of 31 Yuan

Opening at 9:15 AM, the price retreated to 6,505 yuan, 33 yuan lower than the previous day's midday close. It continued to retreat to the 6,500 yuan mark. Xinfeng Yongli advanced, rising to 6,510 yuan. Yi Feng, Heng Ji, and Yi Da released and sold, falling to 6,495 yuan. Chi Da, Shun Yuan, and Xinfeng Yong advanced again, raising it to 6,510 yuan. After Yi Da and others released it, it fell to 6,497 yuan. The US dollar suddenly recovered from easing. Tong Kang, Yong De, Fu, He Sheng, Ju Feng, and retail investors all bought in, gradually rising by more than ten yuan, lifting it to 6,524 yuan. Ren Cheng Yong, Xinfeng Yong, and De Da sold off, retreating to 6,507 yuan at midday. The midday close was 6,511 yuan. Xin Yuan and Heng Ji sold off, retreating to 6,498 yuan. Finally, it was 6,503 yuan. The afternoon opened at 2:00 PM at 6,500 yuan, a low of 11 yuan. De Cheng and He Cheng sold off to a low of 6,495 yuan, as Da Feng, Xinfeng, and Yonglai bought in, gradually rising. Retail investors also started buying in, and the price gradually rose by 25 yuan, rising to 6,520 yuan, as Yi Da, De Fu, and Li Tai sold off, ultimately settling 15 yuan lower, at 6,505 yuan. The market closed at 3:30 PM at 6,507 yuan, continuing to fall 31 yuan compared to the previous day's midday close. Based on the settlement price of August US dollars at 5.34375 yuan, it was 6,517 yuan, a difference of 10 yuan. After the close, Yi Da sold off to 6,504 yuan, and finally, it was raised to 6,510 yuan. There was a difference of 29 yuan that day. The selling price of the gold of the cash house's own brand was 7,150 yuan, with a reduction of 80 yuan for acceptance. There was no market for current standard gold prices.

No Change in the Original Price of Ornamental Gold

The exchange price of gold jewelry per tael in Yinlou was still 735 yuan at Datong Hang and Xintong Hang, with a reduction of 40 yuan for acceptance.

### Food Grain The Southern Advance Actually Realized Only Rice Merchants Were Excited The Ball Game Was Played with Great Enthusiasm

The report of Japan's southern advance in rice had the effect of stimulating ordinary speculative rice merchants and causing them to feel greatly excited. The "ball game" group and the "搶帽" group in particular prayed deeply for the rumors not to cease, so as to invigorate the market daily. Taking advantage of the rising wind from the previous day, the report added fuel to the fire. More and more rumors spread in the market, and as a result, the market went higher and higher. Although the wind and rain were heavy and the market was completely flooded, the speculative groups did not mind wading through the water, coming in a rolling wave. The formal real sales client groups and the merchants of this street mostly disappeared and did not arrive, but this small number of heavily speculative people took advantage of the situation by pushing the price up and releasing it, kicking it back and forth, and the market price immediately increased by four or five yuan. In particular, the Yinghua Company was highly sought after, and the spot rice tracked the rise, but because the real sales lacked a large part to the market, the "ball game" group inevitably looked on with caution regarding the spot rice that was to be paid for in cash. The transaction of spot rice was reduced to about 4,000 bags. Yinghua Company's futures were not fully paid, so there were still more than 1,000 tons of transactions. Since it was difficult to increase the transaction, the floating profits had already sought to obtain a net profit for settlement, and the market immediately saw a selling wind, and the market price suddenly dropped by two or three yuan. As a result, Yinghua Company was still two or three yuan higher, and the spot rice was only one or two yuan higher. Yinghua Company's spot "small squeeze" was from 147 yuan, and returned to a small amount to 144.5 yuan, with the "期" at 147 yuan. The No. 2 "退米" spot price was 141 yuan to 140 yuan, and the "期" was 143 yuan to 140.05 yuan. The broken rice spot price was 104.5 yuan, and the spot rice "small squeeze" was as high as 119.3 yuan and as low as 117 yuan. However, it was said that there were slightly arriving customers before the close, and the market was tired and turned stable.

The Shanghai Municipal Council's imported rice arrived in Shanghai one after another. The Yuezhou cargo ship arrived at the port on Tuesday, and 10,000 bags of imported rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council were transported from Hong Kong, as reported in previous reports. The Hanyang cargo ship on Wednesday also loaded 15,000 bags of imported rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council from Hong Kong, and docked at the wharf of this bank on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading.

### Japanese Merchants Handle Noodle Export

The current market for Western noodles is seeing a rising trend, as sales to Northern customers have suddenly become active. Japanese merchants are procuring for re-export, and there are also reports of shipments to the interior. Furthermore, it is stimulated by the events in Vietnam, and market sentiment has suddenly turned upward. Real sales and囤戸 merchants are both showing good interest. Jinlong Noodles have leaped to 32 yuan to 32.15 yuan. Fortress Noodles have risen to 33.1 yuan. Shuangying Brand noodles are at 31.5 yuan. Lvbao Brand is at 31.45 yuan. Clock Tower Noodles have also risen from 32.3 yuan to 33 yuan, with an actual weight of 33.5 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan to 0.6-0.7 yuan compared to before. There are also customer enquiries for Smoke Pipe brand American noodles transshipped from Hong Kong, priced at 31.8 yuan. It is said that the quality of these noodles is quite good, but because the brand is not popular, the price is relatively low. Furthermore, it is heard that mixed brand noodles are gradually being transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The Yuezhou cargo ship that arrived yesterday had a new arrival of 3,000 bags of 菜麥 brand Australian noodles. Wheat is calm, with no positive market.

### Oil Cake German Merchants Reselling Clear Oil Raw Soybean Oil and Corn Still Rising

Yesterday's edible oil market saw both rises and falls. Raw soybean oil was still scarce and in demand, and the market price rose by another three or four yuan. Clear oil, on the other hand, was affected by the sale by German洋行, and turned down. Both near and far terms decreased by several cents to more than one yuan. It is estimated that 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil and 10 barrels of soybean oil, 40 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, and more than 4,000担 of Qing油 from a major factory were sold (price details in the high price list).

Corn has recently been favored by Japanese merchants, and sales are quite good. Those who hold the goods are all thinking of raising the price. Yesterday, because the price of rice rose sharply, the market sentiment was increasingly strong, and the price uniformly increased by more than one yuan. It is estimated that a total of more than 10,000 bags of Saigon and Holland corn were sold (market details in the market price). On the 25th, 800 bags of soybeans were shipped to Xiamen, 110 bags were shipped to Hong Kong, 500 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Xiamen, and 100 bags of sorghum were shipped to Xiamen.

### Sugar Market Sugar Also Tightening

Yesterday's sugar market was tight due to international conditions, with concerns about the source of supply. The association's spot price for coarse white new goods was 96.4 yuan, and the July 30th "打單" price was 96.7 yuan to 97 yuan in the morning, and 97.5 yuan in the afternoon, up one yuan. Holland red spot NT mark was 75 yuan, up five cents, TCC mark was 75.2 yuan, Taikoo 车 white HX mark was 94.1 yuan, HM mark was 84 yuan, and there were no other transactions. On the 24th, 100 bags of sugar were shipped from Hong Kong.

### Yarn & Cotton Cotton Yarn at the 600 Yuan Level In and Out Three or Four Times Already

The recent yarn market has been rising and falling unexpectedly, with no definite trend. This is because of the divergent market sentiment, and the varying intentions of speculators. The short positions argued that the Vietnam issue was becoming increasingly tense, and the標金 market was sluggish, so they tended to sell. As for the long positions, they were optimistic that raw materials were difficult to ease, and a certain company was gradually buying in. Therefore, buyers would flock in when the price was low, and selling would be active when the price was high. It can be imagined that the long and short sides have entered a stage of contention. The fundamental problem is still that the sales of 20-count yarn are quiet, and there are few traders at low prices. So, at this 600 yuan level, there have been three or four round trips. Some people say that such a rotation may see a long-term trend emerge, so those who "搶帽子" are even more uneasy. In fact, how do they know if they are not overthinking it? The high price for 20-count double-horse yarn was 1,609 yuan, and the low price was 1,588 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,591 yuan, falling to 1,585 yuan. Then, it recovered to 1,598 yuan due to short covering. The final price was 1,593-1,594 yuan.

Double-horse opening in the morning, the market atmosphere was immediately depressed, due to the urgent report of the war in Vietnam. There were many "殺手" in the market. The first盘 opened at 1,609 yuan, and fell directly to 1,596 yuan. Then, there were profitable people "扒空", and there was a slight recovery of more than 600 yuan, between 1,601 and 1,602 yuan, up and down, for quite a long time. However, there were still no buyers on the table, and the market eased again. At around 12:00, there was floating long activity, and it rose again to 1,606 yuan. In less than a moment, the標金 market was not good, and a selling wind suddenly arose in the market, gradually falling downward, and closing at 1,589 yuan. It was found that the trading statistics for half a day totaled 7,305 packages. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed below: Hong Kong 300, 同行 7,000, Nanyang 5. The total is 7,305.

The market situation of Jin Shuangma futures yarn. At the initial opening in the morning, the long positions were uneasy due to the tense situation in Vietnam, and they turned to selling in groups. The market fell six yuan in August and four and a half yuan in October. After the opening, the August period continued to fall to 1,446.5 yuan. The opening low price for both September and October was held. After entering, because the difference between the spot yarn and the futures yarn was too large, speculators turned to selling. Factory orders were buying futures yarn to cover the spot yarn, and there were many people doing this. The downward trend turned here, and the price gradually recovered. At midday, the August period fell by three yuan, September fell by two yuan, and October fell by five and a half yuan. The trading volume was 4,330 packages. The initial situation in the afternoon market continued to be soft. The August period fell further to 1,440 yuan, September to 1,515 yuan, and October to 1,531 yuan. After short covering, there was a slight recovery. The results of the evening closing showed that both August and September fell by 7.5 yuan compared to the previous day, and October fell by 5 yuan. The total trading volume for the whole day was 9,750 packages, a decrease of 1,610 packages compared to the previous day. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the whole day are recorded on the left (the net market bid price).

### The Situation in Vietnam is Clear The Price of Coarse Fleece Rangoon Cotton Suddenly Rose The Success or Failure of Speculation Depends on the Attitude of Britain and the United States

The cotton market has been rising for many days. Although the New York cotton market fell back due to poor conditions in the Far East, Shanghai is taking the stance that Japan's occupation of Vietnam, and Britain and the United States are making grand pronouncements, but it is unclear whether they are just a silver-like wax gun head or will actually go on stage with real swords and guns. Speculative cotton merchants believe there is an opportunity to speculate, and the price of coarse fleece Rangoon cotton has risen by a huge four or five yuan.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to long liquidation and Southern gang selling, and then fell again due to the unstable situation in the Far East. As a result, the closing price was about forty pounds lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to selling by European exporters, but then rose due to cotton merchants covering. Finally, the market fell again due to speculator selling and the chaotic situation in the Far East. Yesterday's closing prices fell by six to eleven rupees each.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading market was flat, and the transaction volume was narrow. Because the price of American and Indian cotton suddenly fell, and the international situation was unpredictable, the purchasing intention of all parties turned weak. The general cotton dealers all held a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, it seems that there were few spot transactions, as well as訂購 for futures.

### Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Unstable

Factory Cloth The market was flat and tired yesterday, and the trading was quiet. This was due to the tense situation in the Far East, which caused people to be disturbed. For the selling market, fine cloth and twill fell 0.25 to 0.5 yuan, coarse cloth fell 0.5 yuan, and a part of plain bleached and dyed cloth fell 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The成交 amount of various cloths was more than 300 pieces for this street, more than 200 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth and coarse cloth for the Guangdong and Hong Kong and Nanyang gangs, and more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and velvet, etc. for the Beilu Dajin gang. On the 25th, there were 27 pieces of export piece goods shipped to Xiamen, and 670 pieces shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth Yesterday, due to the serious situation in Vietnam, the morale of people inside and outside the industry was weak, and they tended to sell. The market was tired. The futures prices of Longtou fine cloth in the exchange fell 0.69 yuan in July and August, 0.6 yuan in September, and 0.51 yuan in October. The closing price of the spot Longtou factory order was 49.425 yuan. The intermediate-grade fine cloth and fine twill of various brands also fell by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan each due to the quiet sales. The back market price of the 色货 Four Gentlemen Beaverteen fell to 1.615 yuan, and slightly recovered to 1.61875 yuan at the close.

### Coal & Charcoal Charcoal Branches Source is Controlled Again

The source of charcoal branches has recently been reported to be controlled again in the production area. The external expenses are huge, and the number of arrivals of wheel sailing boats is rare. There are only five arrivals down the river, so people are optimistic and industry insiders are vigorously working. The posted prices have been firm and persistent. Yesterday, the opening price of large number of 反白 charcoal was 1.25 yuan per handful, the price of medium size Taiwan charcoal was two handfuls, the price of Huangsong charcoal was 3.375 yuan per three handfuls, and the price of Sikou charcoal was four handfuls. The price of hauling by码头排车 is added separately.

### Dried & Preserved Goods New Price of Lanzhu Branches Rose Again

The Lanzhu branches producing areas have been seeing new products for many days. Because the sailing transportation has been temporarily blocked, they have not been transported to Shanghai. It is heard that this year's harvest is very poor, so the production price has risen again, increasing by 30 to 40 yuan compared to before.

### New Arrivals of Daxing Vegetables

The first batch of new 大興 vegetables arrived slightly yesterday. It was immediately sampled and the water quality was still good. It was then sold at 230 yuan. It is heard that the selling price of the industry insiders is also similar. It is also said that the production price of Xuzhou vegetables is gradually easing.

Spring and Autumn

### Bombing Heat Wave Torture A True Record of Life in the War-Time Capital

— Pan Xulun

The hardship of life in Chongqing these days is truly indescribable. Since I came to Chongqing last summer until this spring, I once wrote a cheerful song in the air-raid shelter and sent it back for my friends to read. But at present, no matter how optimistic I am, I cannot say the word "cheerful." Thinking back to the days of early spring, one could "work at sunrise, rest at sunset, walk comfortably instead of riding, have warm clothes and full meals, have labor to dispel boredom, entrust troubles to the swamps, have spring dreams to seek entertainment, and have caves to enter during bombing." It was truly a happy life. At present, the weather is scorching hot, with indoor temperatures often above 100 degrees, and road temperatures as high as 120 to 130 degrees. Walking comfortably is impossible, and labor feels even more exhausting, with nothing to dispel boredom. Moreover, night raids are frequent, and on every moonlit night, one is anxious and dare not sleep peacefully. How can there be spring dreams? Sometimes, the all-clear signal is given after midnight, and lack of sleep often makes it impossible to work at sunrise. By the time the air raid alarm sounds again in the evening, one cannot rest even at sunset. Although there are still caves to enter during bombing, the caves are crowded and narrow, and the stench of sweat and carbon dioxide makes people want to vomit. Looking back at the points in the cheerful song written in the spring, almost none exist now. Zeng Wenzhenggong once said, "In times of peace and happiness, even the wise cannot avoid frowning upon events; in times of worry and suffering, even the enlightened cannot celebrate against the crowd." Although I claim to be enlightened, and often encourage myself with the saying "adapt to circumstances," I cannot help but be alarmed at present. Yesterday afternoon, I had a casual conversation with Mr. Xu Jiqing (Yifu, who came from Hong Kong). Xu said that to spend the summer in Chongqing, one must have a strong body and a diligent spirit, and neither is dispensable. Without a diligent spirit, one will be desolate; without a strong body, one will become ill. I said that those who come to Chongqing but do not stay here to experience the taste of life have come in vain. We laughed together and parted. Although I complain, I consider myself to meet the two conditions mentioned by Mr. Xu, and I sincerely wish to stay here and taste more bitterness to wait for the sweetness to come. I write this in a rambling fashion to comfort my friends in Shanghai.

### Grand Opening

— Li Hongli

A Confucian scholar in error? A gambling fanatic?

The "Economic Primary School" sign hung high at the 里口. This school was founded by Old Tang, A Wu, and Little Zhou; Old Tang was the principal because he had borrowed the most money. A Wu had studied for two years in junior high school, which was considered the best education among them, so he served as the director of education. Little Zhou had managed workers, so he served as the director of student affairs.

They rented a亭子间 as the advanced classroom and built a loft above it to serve as the principal's office. Half of the parlor served as the elementary classroom, and the other half was Chen Ming's "Pawn Ticket Business," which he was asked to serve as the arithmetic teacher.

On the first day of enrollment, they were all excited. But not until evening did one person come with three children.

"Is this place registered?"

They were all stunned. Chen Ming, thinking he was smart, said:

"The 'Ministry of Industry' (?) has specially approved it."

Old Tang became quick-witted after he heard it.

"We have two large classrooms where you can play菱角, marbles, and kick balls as much as you want. The tuition is also very low, 18 yuan for elementary and 20 yuan for advanced. I can give you a discount. An 80% discount..."

"Sir, I have many children, and the burden is very heavy. Is there a way to reduce the fee?"

"If one student introduces five students, they can be completely free. Three, and they can get a 50% discount. Two..."

The person left disappointed. But they were even more disappointed.

A day, a month passed, and those who came to register either asked for free tuition or half fees. There were only fifteen students in the economic primary school in total. One was free, seven were half-price, and five were discounted. Their income did not cover expenses. The landlord was forcing them to pay the rent, and Old Tang was anxious. Although A Wu suggested renting out the store space at night, because there were no bedding, not many people would live there.

Creditors forced them to pay, the landlord wanted rent, the furniture store clamored to move the tables and chairs. They had no choice but to pawn their clothes and bedding. But they still couldn't pay off the debt. The landlord was about to kick them out, and the furniture store had already moved the tables and chairs away. The clothes and bedding were also gone. Old Tang burst into tears, and A Wu was stunned... They were about to be unemployed again!

### Why is it Always Sour

— Written by Lao Ni

### "Price Drop"

— Shizhu

The "price drop" in gas is due to the reasonable "revenue generation" from byproducts, etc., leading to a voluntary proposal to reduce the burden on users. The "Board of Directors" of the Public Works Department approved a reduction of 35% in the "surcharge." This stands in stark contrast to the post-price-increase public transportation fares.

And these past couple of days, because the "air" couldn't support the burden of "speculation," "coal briquettes" and "rice" have also surprisingly seen price drops! The infighting between "big factories" and "small factories," and the frantic release of goods by "hoarders," shows a situation that resembles a "collapse of a thousand miles."

Indeed, this is "good news" for the citizens. However, it has also stirred up unnecessary worries for us. Perhaps these worries are superfluous, but they are nonetheless a fact—a clearly understood fact that presents itself before our eyes and grows in today's society.

It is none other than the phenomenon of "the big fish eats the small fish." This phenomenon disgusts us, pains us, and we cannot remain silent and let people be slaughtered.

Therefore, we must point out that after the "big factories" have squeezed out the business scope of the "small factories," and after the big hoarders have bought up the small hoarders, the prices of coal briquettes and rice will inevitably be left at the mercy of their "big"-headed friends, "to do as they please"!

In reality, these phenomena are hardly surprising today. As long as someone has a large capital and great power, they can "do as they please." Others' prices are not prices; only theirs are the "standard." Others' goods are not goods; only theirs are "authentic." In this way, once the "big fish" have eaten up the "small fish," they will eventually start devouring the ordinary citizens. Moreover, once the "small fish" have been "eaten up," there will be no one to compete with them at that time, and they can ask for whatever price they want.

Therefore, while today's "small favors" are not bad, we must also point out the tricks that may come in the future.

In this regard, we hope that the authorities can make plans in advance. Establishing public warehouses for daily necessities such as rice and coal seems like a task worth undertaking. Furthermore, launching a price-suppression movement would be a good time to "ride the wave." We hope the authorities will not hesitate any longer.

At the same time, what we expect even more from the citizens is that they do not become overjoyed by "small favors" only to be exploited by the "big"-headed speculators when the "lean season" arrives. By then, it might be too late.

### Hygiene

— Yaoyao

Doctor: To be healthy, the first thing to pay attention to is hygiene. If someone gives you something that hasn't been disinfected, never hold it in your hand, otherwise, terrible bacteria will be transmitted to you.

Patient: Then, Doctor, how am I supposed to give you my money!

Doctor: . . . . . . . . .

### Weak Coffee

— Jichen

A friend said to me, "I have never liked wearing sunglasses. It's not that I don't know that sunglasses have eye protection functions, it's just that I love the light too much. In the heat of summer, these lenses can bring people coolness, but all you see is a monotonous black! Besides, my skin is as rough and dark as the bottom of a pot. Where would I find the time to scrub it white!"

### Reading the Shen Bao

— Xinghua

All in the family read the Shen Bao:

Dad reads the "Economic News" and "Economic Supplements."

Mom reads the "Clothing, Food, Housing and Transportation" Weekly.

Grandfather reads "New Copies from Old Newspapers."

Eldest brother reads the dance hall advertisements and local news (especially the scandalous ones).

Second brother reads the "Entertainment Industry Film Advertisements."

Third brother reads the "Sports News" and "Education News."

Older sister likes to read the full-length novels "Qiu Haitang" and "Blood Rain and Jade Flowers."

I like to read the international and domestic news and "Free Talk" and "Spring and Autumn."

My younger brother, who just graduated from elementary school, reads the enrollment advertisements.

My little sister likes to read the "Children's Weekly." A relative who is temporarily staying with us reads the "Rental Classified Advertisements."

### Qiu Haitang

— Qin Shouou

Although the Meng family's junior housekeeper felt somewhat unhappy because she hadn't finished saying what she wanted to say, she really liked Mei Bao too much and couldn't bear to be angry with her. She just casually said, "See you tomorrow," and, with the kind of impatience that people who are eager to get something done often feel—that is, an unpleasant feeling aroused by not quickly getting something done—she walked alone across the street.

Her original plan was to go to Mei Bao again early the next morning to talk, but after finishing dinner, she couldn't help but use sending lotus root powder as a pretext to peek at Mei Bao's door several times.

"It's okay, Dad is already asleep, Xiao Gouzi is tidying things up inside, let's sit down and talk!" The last time, she saw Mei Bao, and Mei Bao couldn't bear to refuse her kindness, so she hurriedly asked her to stay.

In this way, a long conversation that lasted almost two hours began, which suddenly excited Mei Dou's heart. Even after lying down on the bed, she couldn't fall asleep.

"Anyway, I can't go to school this semester. I'll just be idle at home. It wouldn't hurt to learn opera for a few months, just like she said." She quietly turned over, afraid of waking Qiu Haitang lying across from her. "With my intelligence, I'm sure I can learn it in a few months…?"

Countless naive and ridiculous fantasies instantly flooded her mind.

"The rules for singing opera are completely different from those at school. Meng's wife said that you don't even have to pay when you learn. If you sing well in the future, you'll have to show respect to the teacher," she thought back and forth. "Then if you don't sing well, or if you learn it but don't sing, the teacher will probably just consider it a waste of effort…?"

Thinking of this, she suddenly felt that something was wrong. (67)

### Explanation of National Opera

— Fan Shiren

What I call National Opera is Ping Opera. I don't know who the originator was. I remember that before the war, Mr. Su Shaoqing founded the National Opera Research Association in Shanghai. This term may have been created by this gentleman, but I don't know for sure. I will not ask who defined it for now, but I think it is more appropriate than the old name. In the past, Southerners called Ping Opera Beijing Opera, because it came from the old capital. Since the National Revolutionary Army unified the country and established the capital in Nanjing, Beijing was changed to Beiping, and the name Beijing Opera also gradually, invisibly, became known as Ping Opera. When defining the name of something, if we don't conduct an accurate examination and identification of its appearance, inner nature, and evolution, we often lose the focus of its value and meaning. Looking at the name Ping Opera, it means Beiping Opera. However, do we know whether it is truly a pure Beiping Opera? I know that anyone who has a little research on Ping Opera knows that it itself is transformed from Hui, Han, Kun, Yi, Pangzi, and Luantan operas. It is not like Tan Huang, which originated in Shanghai and is named Shen Opera (the old name was originally Tan, and all places could be called "Ben," which was later corrected), or which originated in Suzhou and is named Su Tan. However, people call it Ping Opera and do not know to correct its meaning, either because they are stuck in habit, or because no one has created a new saying. Now that we know it is inappropriate, how can we not correct it?

Ping Opera is a collection of the great achievements of various famous local operas in China, and a brand-new art that has been produced separately. It combines the strengths of various old operas. Drama is a synthesis of various arts, and Ping Opera is a synthesis of various dramas (referring to old dramas). Therefore, it can be welcomed by the public and is popular all over the country, and even respected by the European and American cultural and artistic circles. I still remember that the Mei Opera Troupe went to the United States and Russia one after another and was warmly loved by the people of those countries, and returned with honor. Mr. Mei has expertise in art, but Ping Opera itself does have the typical beauty of Eastern art. If we now name it Ping Opera, its meaning seems too narrow, whether in appearance or inner nature. In recent times, what can hold the helm of the Chinese opera world, and also be sufficient to represent the art of pure Chinese color, if not Ping Opera? We name its opera National Opera, who would say it is inappropriate? I dare not create strange theories to refresh people's ears and eyes. As the saying goes: "If the name is not correct, the words will not be smooth." Therefore, I say that from now on, the name Ping Opera should be uniformly changed to National Opera.

### Review of Zhongqing's "Love and Hate"

— Beidou

The Zhongqing Troupe laid the foundation for itself with a satisfactory performance at the Russian Art Theatre the day before yesterday, and boldly opened up a new path for the isolated island opera movement. I feel infinite admiration and inspiration. First of all, I think that Zhongqing's choice of script this time was very conscious and cautious. Under Mr. Xia Feng's clever directing techniques, "Love and Hate" is not only a family tragedy that can fully describe a young couple under the feudal poison. It is also the first year that the Chinese people are fighting a sacred battle to win independence and liberation, so from the beginning, it can grasp the psychology of every audience and fully stimulate the audience's patriotic emotions.

The plot is very simple: A young military officer named Bai Yifu was transferred to a small town near Shanghai on the front line of national defense during the Battle of Songhu. There, he accidentally met Tang Lusha, a female student who was soliciting national salvation donations from him. Lusha also recognized that Bai Yifu was her sister Luying's former lover, but it was too late. Her sister had already been forced to marry Luo Baosheng, a silk cloth merchant in the town, four years ago - a loyal, honest but philistine shop owner. His family is of course also an old-fashioned Chinese family. The mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and brother-in-law all look down on Luying and satirize her day and night. Luying naturally lives like a year in this family. Although her husband loves her very much, Luying only finds him hateful. So when Lusha told Luying that she had met Bai Yifu, Luying, under Lusha's lead, secretly met with Bai Yifu. Unexpectedly, at first sight, old feelings rekindled, and they even agreed to elope. However, the husband loved her, and eloping was even less tolerated in the old-fashioned family. A tragedy reached its peak at this time. When Luying's elopement was discovered by her younger uncle Afang and told to her mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and her husband, Luo Baosheng questioned his wife, who had just returned from Bai Yifu's hotel. Luying admitted everything and frankly declared that she must leave this cage-like family and go with Bai Yifu to find a bright and free life. Luo Baosheng loved her and hated her. For a moment, he was at a loss. Under the cold accusations and merciless ridicule of his family, he killed Luying with his own hands, and also ended his own life.

The whole play is divided into five acts, and each act has a very moving performance. The final scene of Luo Baosheng killing Luying with his own hands fully expresses the battle between two different feelings of love and hate, and can also be said to be the battle between reason and feeling. Zhao Min's Luo Baosheng and Min Qiu's Tang Luying both have the most touching performances in this scene. Gao Meng, who plays Luo's mother, is the most successful of all the actors. Meng Na, who plays Lusha, is innocent and lively, and is also a very promising talent. Others such as Fu Bu's Bai Yifu and Xia Ming's Afang can all do it just right. Although "Zhongqing" is a small bubble in the torrent of the isolated island opera movement, its future is bright, and it will definitely have greater achievements and harvests in the future!

Chapter 13 Not Willing to Lower My Head Among the Grasses

Xu Jing then felt that Liu Yinying had a heroic spirit, a warm heart, and noble morality, which was even more admirable, and couldn't help nodding and smiling. After the two women left, he said to Liu Yinying, "Just now, my virtuous brother wielded his sword to kill the bandits, and he was invincible. Although he failed to annihilate their leader, he killed two strong henchmen, which was enough to strip the bandits of their courage, and to vent a sigh of resentment for General Zhou. General Zhou, if he knows underground, will also smile." Liu Yinying said with emotion, "I only hate that I was late, so that I did not follow General Zhou's whip and stirrups to build a little meritorious service. I am always ashamed of General Zhou in my heart. Let's see if there will be a chance to kill the bandits again in the future. Now, please, Brother Jing, go back with me to see my aunt for a moment, and then we will discuss what to do. Brother Jing, you already have a wound on your shoulder, and you used force to kill the bandits just now, will it hinder you?" Xu Jing's charge and killing also came from temporary excitement and stimulation, forgetting the wound on his body. Now that Liu Yinying mentioned it, he felt a faint pain in his shoulder, and his left arm felt very sore and weak, almost unable to lift it up. So he forced himself to say, "It's okay, virtuous brother, don't worry. In the past, people had a great battle with their intestines hanging out, and their courage did not diminish until death. What is my slight injury?" Liu Yinying said, "Then we don't have to stay here, let's go back to Weifeng Mountain to rest." Xu Jing nodded and said okay, picked up his gun from the ground, and followed Liu Yinying up to the saddle. The two of them crossed the horse and took the road back to Weifeng Mountain. The places they passed along the way were all extremely desolate, and nineteen out of ten people had fled to other places, and it was almost impossible to borrow a place to stay at night. After rushing for three days, they had reached Daizhou. But they saw many bandits leaving Daizhou City. The two were anxious to return to the mountain and did not inquire. Suddenly running up Weifeng Mountain, they came to Phoenix Ridge. The two dismounted, and when they looked up, they saw a small linen pennant hanging on the door. Liu Yinying couldn't help but exclaim, "Oh dear! What is the reason for this!" He hurriedly reached out and knocked on the door. After a while, the little maid came to open the door. When she saw Yinying, she rubbed her eyes and said, "Oh dear! Young Master Liu, where have you been? Why have you only returned today?" Liu Yinying did not answer the little maid's inquiry, but hurriedly asked, "Where is my aunt? The linen on the door…," (124)

Furthermore, Jin Yunzhi, who plays the princess in Sitting in the Palace, majored in acting in drama when she studied in the United States. After returning to China, in addition to teaching, she has never been on stage. This performance is very worthy of attention from the general public.

They decided to hold a grand entertainment show at the Luffa Theater on the evening of August 5th, starting at 8 o'clock. It is said that no tickets will be sold, only invitations to the news industry and actors from various troupes.
