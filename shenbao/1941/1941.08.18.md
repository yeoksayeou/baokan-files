### Chinese Military Delegation Arrives in Soviet Capital; Sino-Soviet Leaders Fu and Chiang to Meet; Moscow Tripartite Conference to Be Held Soon; US and UK to Be Represented by Wallace and Eden

Reuters, London, 17th. A diplomatic correspondent for the "Labor Daily" on Sunday claimed that General Chiang Kai-shek will soon travel to Moscow to discuss military issues with Red Army leaders. This will be the first official meeting between Chiang and Stalin. A Chinese military delegation has now arrived in Moscow. It is rumored that any threatening actions by Japan against the Soviet Union will be met with a Sino-Soviet mutual assistance response. The joining of the Red Army and the Chinese army will form a pincer movement against Japan. At the same time, the last of the four different peace conditions proposed by Tokyo has been rejected by General Chiang Kai-shek. Japan clearly wants to keep China out of the Far Eastern war before it breaks out. The correspondent also said that although the burden on the Soviet Union's wartime industry is currently very heavy, the supply of munitions and aircraft to China has not stopped or decreased.

International News Service, London, 17th. The "Sunday Pictorial" today carried an unconfirmed report stating that British Prime Minister Churchill may meet with Stalin for a conference, similar to his talks with President Roosevelt at sea. The "Reynolds News" strongly suggests that General Chiang Kai-shek will soon depart for Moscow to discuss the Far Eastern situation with Red Army leaders, indicating the possibility of a mutual assistance agreement between China and the Soviet Union directed at Japan.

TASS, Moscow, 17th. On the 15th, the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union called on Stalin to present him with a joint telegram from President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill regarding Anglo-American preparations to assist the Soviet Union in fighting Germany. Stalin, on behalf of the Soviet government, requested the British and American ambassadors to convey his thanks to President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. As for Roosevelt and Churchill's suggestion to hold a conference in Moscow to discuss the allocation of raw materials and munitions, Stalin also welcomed it, and said that he would take all steps to ensure that the tripartite conference could be held as soon as possible. Molotov was also present when Stalin received the British and American ambassadors.

Havas, Rome, 16th. According to local newspapers, representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to hold a conference in Moscow in early September, which will be personally presided over by Stalin. The United States will be represented by Vice President Wallace, and the British representative is said to be Foreign Secretary Eden.

International News Service, Moscow, 17th. Since Stalin accepted the joint invitation from President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill, it is expected that an important conference to establish a strong alliance between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union to resist Nazism will be convened in Moscow in a few days. When accepting the invitation yesterday, Stalin told the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union, "We are now trying to arrange for the conference to be held as soon as possible." In their joint communiqué to Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill stated that the main goal of the conference was the distribution of military equipment and raw materials. Soviet diplomatic circles predict that the main result of the Anglo-American-Soviet conference will be the establishment of a "warehouse" for the three countries' military supplies. At the same time, according to news from London, the head of the British delegation to the Soviet Union will be either British Foreign Secretary Eden or British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook, while Hopkins will represent the United States at the conference. After receiving the communiqué from Roosevelt and Churchill, Stalin requested the British and American ministers to convey the Soviet Union's sincere gratitude to their leaders for the aid that the United Kingdom and the United States would provide in the Soviet Union's liberation war against Hitlerism. Roosevelt and Churchill's communiqué stated, "Further battles on other fronts have not yet begun." This phrase implicitly suggests that the United Kingdom may soon launch an attack on continental Europe, in order to force Germany to withdraw its troops from the Eastern Front. All sectors of Soviet society are very interested in this phrase.

International News Service, Washington, 17th. Diplomatic circles here predict that the upcoming Anglo-American-Soviet tripartite conference in Moscow has three objectives: (1) The United Kingdom and the United States want to work to bring the Soviet Union into a new order of democratic countries; (2) The United Kingdom and the United States want to ascertain the strategic position of the Soviet army in the war against Germany and to inform Stalin that British military advisors may assist the Soviet General Staff; (3) The United Kingdom and the United States want to obtain assurances that, regardless of developments on the Western Front, the Soviet Far Eastern Army will remain stationed in Siberia to contain Japan. It is believed that the extent of Stalin's cooperation on a good world order will depend on the extent of Anglo-American aid to the Soviet Union in this war. At the same time, it is rumored that Washington and London are eager to know the true position of the Soviet army on the Western Front.

Japanese Troops Arrive in Indochina Non-Stop, Reaching 80,000 to 100,000

Reuters, Saigon, 17th. The second batch of Japanese troops almost reached Cape Saint Jacques last night, and are scheduled to begin landing in Saigon today. Kun is stationed in Vietnam as the overall commander. The leader of the Japanese mission, Sumida, returned to Hanoi yesterday.

Reuters, Singapore, 17th. Thirty British expatriates arrived here yesterday from Saigon on a French ship, describing the situation of Japanese troops entering Vietnam non-stop. They said that there were already 80,000 to 100,000 Japanese soldiers in Vietnam, but their equipment seemed sufficient for 160,000 troops. A neutral observer said that the general French population is completely pro-British, hoping that the British will win, as this is the only hope to prevent Vietnam from becoming a Japanese colony.

### Overall Review of the World Situation; UK and US Reach Full Understanding; President Roosevelt Announces Progress of the Conference; Says the US Is Not Closer to Entering the War as a Result

United Press, Rockland, Maine, 17th. President Roosevelt said yesterday that during the recent historic maritime conference with British Prime Minister Churchill, when drafting the procedures for postwar peace goals, the UK and US established a full understanding of the situation in major continents of the world. President Roosevelt said that the United States is not closer to entering the war than before. He made the remarks at a press conference held yesterday after disembarking from the yacht "Potomac." President Roosevelt stated that his current plan assumes that the Soviet Union is still at war with the Nazis in the spring of next year. He said that the Soviet Union was not invited to participate in the eight principles of the Anglo-American declaration, and that he knew nothing about any plans to invite the Soviet Union to participate. He said that the Soviet Union's needs include two categories. The first is readily available raw materials to aid in the summer war, and the second need is based on the assumption that the winter war will be half-stalled. This need includes raw materials that can be obtained for the spring war next year. President Roosevelt said that when he and Prime Minister Churchill met, officials of equal rank from the UK and the US held multiple meetings. He declined to disclose the location of the conference or how long it lasted, saying that the reason for keeping this secret was very clear. President Roosevelt pointed out that the first positive development was to request Congress to draft a new budget of several trillion dollars to supplement the original 70 billion lend-lease funds. He said that this request in Congress was currently under study. President Roosevelt said that the Anglo-American understanding was complete on all aspects of the world situation, implying that the United States and the United Kingdom have united in an agreement to facilitate the two countries' actions in dealing with any contingency. The President said that when he and Prime Minister Churchill held a meeting on the former Asian Fleet flagship "Augusta" and the British battleship "Prince of Wales," they discussed all continents. He said that only one meeting was held on the "Augusta." When a reporter asked, "Do you think we are closer to entering the war?" President Roosevelt immediately replied that he did not think that the United States was close to actual participation in the war. He refused to allow newspaper reporters to directly quote the above answer. President Roosevelt said that his exchange of views with Prime Minister Churchill mostly involved the present and the future. He made it clear that his joint actions with the British Prime Minister were to deal with events occurring in any part of the world, but he had no indication whatsoever that the United States' cooperation would be more direct than before, that is, as a munitions factory for democratic countries. Regarding the French political situation, he said that he was unable to understand its inner workings due to a lack of information. Once he returned to Washington, he would discuss the matter with Secretary of State Hull, and would also consult with the Secretary of State on the recent developments in the Far East. He had previously announced that he hoped to meet with the Duke of Kent at Hyde Park next week. President Roosevelt expressed Britain and Churchill's determination to defeat the Nazi regime at any cost. He said that many commentators have ignored the need for the United Kingdom and the United States to exchange views on the world situation as the Nazis invade more countries. He declared that the more this issue is explored, the more terrifying the idea of the Nazis seizing more countries becomes. President Roosevelt said that all democratic countries should carefully explore this issue. President Roosevelt declared that the delegation included General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army, Major General Arnold, Minister of the Air Force of the Army, Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, Major General King, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet, Under Secretary of State Welles, Harriman, and the President's private attendants. President Roosevelt declared that the Soviet Union did not receive aid under the lend-lease program because the Soviet Union had cash to pay for war materials. The President left the yacht at 4 p.m. and took a special car to Washington. All the streets from the river bank to the station were decorated with flags to welcome him, and the viewers were like walls. Colonel Starling, the White House guard captain, led many secret detectives to Rockland before the yacht arrived to carry out security. Local military and police also took on security work along the President's route.

Motivation for the Conference, Reuters, Rockland, 17th. President Roosevelt said that the motivation for his conference with the British Prime Minister began in February of this year, with the goal of joint planning. Later, the date of the conference was delayed by three months due to the wars in Greece and Crete. He believes that both the joint declaration and the criticisms of the declaration ignore one thing, and that is the need to exchange views on the situation in various places under Nazi rule. The more the situation in the occupied areas or Nazi-controlled areas is studied, the more terrifying it feels to have this power in the area.

Prayers on Board the Ship. The President mentioned that Churchill held a prayer on the battleship "Prince of Wales" on August 10, saying that all those who participated in the worship felt that this was an important prayer of historical significance. The prayer ceremony was presided over by one British and one American priest.

The Prime Minister's Whereabouts. It was also said that he and Churchill consulted for more than one day, which was very effective in exchanging information in the present and the future. As for Churchill's whereabouts, the President refused to announce it, only saying that to his knowledge, the British Prime Minister did not intend to visit the United States, and he himself did not intend to visit the United Kingdom at this time. President Roosevelt was energetic, calm, and smoking a cigarette when he received the reporters. He smiled and greeted each reporter who entered the reception room. After the reception, the President disembarked, and the audience cheered loudly. Then he went to the station and took a special train to Washington. All the streets from the river bank to the station were decorated with flags to welcome him, and the viewers were like walls. Colonel Starling, the White House guard captain, led many secret detectives to Rockland before the yacht arrived to carry out security. Local military and police also took on security work along the President's route.

### UK and US Plan to Send Troops to Defend the Yunnan-Burma Road

Reuters, Chongqing, 17th. Informed sources here, in view of Japan's plan to attack the Soviet Far Eastern Army and the deteriorating relations between Chongqing and Vichy, expect that there will soon be a decisive battle in the Pacific. According to Chinese sources, the United Kingdom and the United States are currently making active plans to help China defend the road through Burma in order to prevent the Japanese from cutting off China's lifeline. It is rumored that the United Kingdom has begun to build eight new air force bases in Burma, and is building three new roads in northern Burma, so that when Japanese planes attack the railway between Yangon and Kunming, traffic to China can be maintained. The Chinese believe that although the Japanese continue to put pressure on Thailand, their main goal is still to attack the Soviet Union. The reason why they are currently active in Vietnam and Thailand is nothing more than to prevent British and American intervention. If Japan wants to wage a large-scale war in Southeast Asia, it must have at least 200,000 troops, but there are only 50,000 Japanese troops in Vietnam today.

### The Future of US-Japan Relations Depends on Japanese Actions

United Press, Washington, 17th. "Scripps-Howard" newspaper commentator Danny said yesterday that due to the Nazis' advance in Soviet territory and the arrival of American aid to the Soviet Union in the Far West Siberia, the danger of a US-Japan war will reach a new peak within two weeks. Denny said that unless Japan can preemptively prevent American aid from reaching the Soviet Union in an effective way, the Soviet Union will become one of the members of the Sino-British-American-Dutch anti-Japanese defense alliance in the Far East. He also said that the bombers of the Soviet Union in Vladivostok are the planes closest to Japan in the world. Denny also said that the events of the past three days have temporarily calmed the Pacific, and the military leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States have greater confidence. It is because Japan is now rapidly losing its initiative in the military. But he also said that what is needed is to speed up precautions because of the spirit of the samurai and the overall plan for the future.

United Press, Washington, 17th. When Secretary of State Hull received reporters yesterday, he declined to comment on the rumor from London that the United States would protect the Pacific after the Roosevelt-Churchill conference. Hull said that he has repeatedly issued warnings, pointing out the dangers facing the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere, because some places in South America, especially areas that produce excess raw materials, may be invaded. When a reporter asked what efforts the United States and other American republics are currently making to resist Nazi activities in the Americas, Hull replied that nothing could be disclosed about those who are currently doing their best to conquer the world.

### Japan Refuses US Ship to Sail to Japan to Transport US Citizens Back Home; Coolidge Ordered to Sail Directly to San Francisco; Both Parties Are Negotiating Exchange of Evacuees

United Press, Washington, 17th. The State Department announced yesterday that Japan had refused the American ship "President Coolidge" to sail to the Japanese coast to transport 100 American citizens away from Japan to return home. Japanese observers said that the reason why Japan refused the American ship to transport American citizens back to the United States was obviously to use them as hostages, on the one hand to guarantee the departure of Japanese citizens from the United States, and on the other hand to guarantee better treatment for Japanese ships in American ports. According to reports, these 100 American citizens originally intended to take a Japanese ship back home, but the trip was canceled. The State Department formally announced that the reason why the State Department originally sent the "President Coolidge" to Japan to evacuate American citizens after leaving Shanghai last Thursday was because the original Pan Pacific route to Japan had been canceled. The US Embassy in Tokyo contacted the Japanese Foreign Ministry, but the Foreign Ministry only allowed the "President Coolidge" to carry 20 American officials back to the United States, but was not allowed to carry American citizens. Washington then ordered the ship to sail directly to San Francisco.

United Press, Tokyo, 17th. The "Asahi Shimbun" reported today from San Francisco that Japanese Consul General Muto received instructions from Japanese Ambassador Nomura and has gone to Washington to discuss dispatching a special ship to the United States to evacuate Japanese citizens residing in the United States. At the same time, Japan today allowed several American ships to sail from Japan to Shanghai.

Hindu Believers Determined to Resist Insults

Reuters, North Summer War, 17th. The Buno Border Muslim tribe opened a meeting yesterday, expressing their trust in the current policies of the British government and their willingness to resist the enemy together with the British government when the enemy invades the border. The conference also condemned Japan's purpose, saying that it is the duty of every Muslim to resist Japan's conspiracy against Islam.

Philippine Independence Issue Depends on the Outcome of the War; US and Philippines Share Life and Death

Reuters, Manila, 17th. Philippine President Quezon said yesterday that the issue of Philippine independence is currently being decided on the Atlantic, on the Soviet battlefield, in the armories, and in the sound of bombs. Filipinos have not given up their ultimate goal, but this issue is no longer in the hands of Filipinos or others. If the result of this war is to guarantee the rights of small countries, then the Philippines will definitely be independent. If we are a small country relying on the breath of big countries, Filipinos can only bid farewell to independence. We are a democratic country, we trust democratic life, so we share life and death with the United States. Quezon also spoke about the next presidential election, saying that he was nominated as a candidate for president, saying that if elected, he would serve the country, but he did not want to campaign.

Japanese Domestic Resources Depleted; Promote Thrift and Frugality

United Press, Tokyo, 17th. An official from the Ministry of Agriculture announced today a detailed plan to increase the production of wheat and sweet potatoes, the purpose of which is to use these two items instead of rice as the main food for the country. The plan also encourages the consumption of sardines and seaweed. The Ministry of Agriculture also announced that from now on, vegetables will also be rationed per capita, and vegetables cannot be transported from the countryside to the city without permission. The government also announced that it is preparing an air raid insurance plan, according to which the government will sign the policies issued by private insurance companies and share the insurance costs. The of women is also implemented by the government on a per capita basis, but female ticket sellers on trams and buses, female teachers, etc. can get priority. The government declared that women of the leisure class will no longer be able to obtain . At the same time, the government mobilized students from schools to work on farms.

Mexico Prepares to Restore Diplomatic Relations with the United Kingdom

Reuters, Mexico City, 17th.

The Mexican Senate recently passed a resolution by a majority to urge the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Mexico. The diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Mexico were severed in May 1938 due to the Mexican government's confiscation of British oil fields in Mexico.

Reuters, Mexico City, 17th.

The Mexican government is now proceeding with the immediate construction of a railway across the Tehuantepec Isthmus, north from Coatzacoalcos to Salina Cruz in the south. This move was prompted by the possibility of the United States entering the war, fearing that the Panama Canal may not be able to cope with traffic between the two oceans.

### Japan Speculates That UK and US Are Using Intermediaries to Induce Japan to Distance Itself from the Axis; The Anti-Aggression Camp Is Gradually Expanding; Japan Cannot Hide Its Anxious Emotions

United Press, Tokyo, 17th. Political observers here said yesterday that they believe the Roosevelt-Churchill peace goals declaration is intended to induce Japan and small European countries to separate from Germany. They said that Japan must not allow itself to fall into the trap of the United Kingdom and the United States, but should continue to implement its "established policy." Political commentators said that the maritime conference convened by the British and American leaders must have established some secret military understandings, otherwise there would be no need for naval and military experts to attend the meeting. It was also said that this declaration was an "empty, pleasant, clever, and cunning action" so that Central America could use it to cope with future developments. The "Japan Wide News" said that this decisive meeting may attempt to deal with Hitler's peace offensive because the German peace appeal, if it reaches the ears of the British and American people before the Roosevelt-Churchill joint declaration, may have an important reaction. The newspaper also said that Japan has the same goals as Roosevelt and Churchill, but it is doubtful whether Japan will still have freedom of the high seas without a navy. The commentary said that the document was an "Atlantic appeal" meaning that it has nothing to do with Japan.

United Press, Tokyo, 17th. Japanese newspapers today paid close attention to the meeting to be held in Moscow by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and predicted that the three countries would plan military strategies to deal with Japan and Germany. The newspapers said that this meeting shows Moscow's dependence on anti-Axis forces, which is very important for Japan because the Soviet Union will be responsible for delivering supplies to anti-Axis countries. The "National News" said that if Germany defeats the Soviet Union, the war may spread to the Far East, Stalin may abandon the Soviet Union in Europe and consolidate his position in Siberia, and then attack Japan. The newspaper said that if the current military and industrial plan in Siberia is completed, Japan will no longer be able to occupy it alone. The newspaper also strongly advocated the abundance of mining in Siberia. The "Hochi Shimbun" said that Japan's resource allocation plan will have a considerable impact on Japan-Soviet relations, and said that the Soviet Union has followed the British into a trap and dug its own grave. The newspaper also said that if Moscow participates in the opposition to the Axis powers, resulting in a break in Japan-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union should bear the responsibility. The newspaper also urged the Soviet Union to consider its position.

United Press, St. Peter, 17th. The American oil tanker "Claral" sailed yesterday with 95,000 gallons of aircraft fuel to Vladivostok. This is one of the four oil tankers received by the Shipping Board to transport oil to the Soviet Union.

Editorial

### Eight Principles and Fourteen Points

Regarding the objective of this war extending to the three continents of Asia, Europe, and Africa, the aggressor has already openly stated that it is to establish a so-called "new order." In other words, it is to ensure the political and economic leadership and control of these countries in regions far larger than their own territories. On the other hand, the democratic countries have a very clear stance on destroying aggression and violence and preserving the independence and freedom of the invaded countries, but they have always lacked an overall plan. During this time, the US President has repeatedly declared his important beliefs in his fireside chats, and Churchill and Eden have also repeatedly explained the war objectives of Britain, but they have not yet been formulated into general principles. It is still a long way to the end of the war. To talk about a post-war plan may be a bit premature, but the so-called post-war plan is actually the ultimate goal of the war. In order to strengthen war confidence and promote the realization of victory, this issue should never be allowed to form a major mystery in the minds of the world for a long time.

Now this shortcoming has been compensated for after the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. Naturally, the eight principles and that declaration announced by the British side on the 14th are not the only achievements of the meeting. Perhaps the most important thing for all parties is the various steps that are strictly guarded to deal with the crisis in Europe and Asia. But it is absolutely not allowed to ignore the important meaning of this more abstract peace plan. What has plunged the international situation into today's chaos and darkness is undoubtedly one of the important reasons is the solutions after the previous Great War. Some unfortunate events in the past 20 years should be traced back to the Paris Peace Conference, and the United States itself did not participate in the League of Nations advocated by President Wilson, which made the political organization for resolving international disputes doomed to failure and decline from the day it was established. Therefore, if the world does not want to repeat the previous mistakes and make the future world gradually approach the ideal state, then this post-war plan must be paid attention to first.

Among the eight principles this time, the first three elaborate on the political stance and aspirations of Britain and the United States; the middle three express the ideals in the economic aspect; the seventh reiterates the United States' traditional policy of freedom of the seas; and the eighth opposes the use of force and emphasizes the disarmament of aggressor countries. Although there are only general principles here, with many details, and how to implement them concretely still needs more meticulous and detailed discussion, all the biggest problems and disputes in the international community today have been put forward with correct solutions, drawing a succinct outline for the democratic countries' broad and profound ideal beliefs about the future of the world. Under such a goal, it is expected that it will be able to exert greater combat power and make the situation clear as soon as possible.

The disclosure of the eight principles this time naturally reminds people of the fourteen points announced by President Wilson in 1918. What must be explained here is that although the spirit of the two has some common points, this time it is by no means a restatement of the fourteen points, and I believe it will not repeat Wilson's failure. First, the fourteen points were Wilson's personal beliefs formed with the assistance of some experts. Even in the United States, they failed to gain unanimous support from the country. Therefore, although they were generally welcomed by the world at the time, they always lacked binding force; but the eight principles this time are the conclusions reached by the agreement between the British and American authorities, and at the same time, they are the promotion of national policy and the clarification of steps. Second, most of Wilson's propositions were limited to political issues. There are very few achievements in the more basic economic aspect, and the organization of the League of Nations also failed because it did not consider the economic foundation and forced countries with conflicting economic interests to cooperate politically. This time, special efforts have been made in the economic aspect, and Article 4 states that all countries, regardless of size, strength, or whether they win or lose, can enjoy the trade and raw materials necessary for their economic prosperity on equal terms. The fifth item states that it will promote full cooperation among countries in the economic aspect, and the sixth item hopes that after defeating the Nazis, all countries will be able to live and work in peace within their borders. This will not only make the aggressors who use "dissatisfaction" as an excuse lose their theoretical basis, but also is a necessary way to promote true peace and stability in the world. Third, among the fourteen points, in addition to Article 6 to Article 13, which separately stated the handling of the postwar territorial sovereignty and other issues of the warring countries on both sides of Europe, there were few specific insights on how to eliminate world unrest and prevent future turmoil. Everything was entrusted to the League of Nations to solve. This joint declaration of Britain and the United States did not mention the League of Nations and its future, but if all the provisions can be implemented satisfactorily, the international future can be expected to be completely changed, and in the end it will not be difficult to promote more effective political cooperation among countries. We have no intention of belittling Wilson and his great aspirations, but there is no doubt that the declaration of Britain and the United States is more practical and concrete. This point is naturally related to the times, and it also proves that human reason and wisdom are constantly evolving.

The most important issue at present is naturally how to win the victory in the anti-aggression war, and at the same time, we should also consider how to make everything after the war be resolved reasonably. This is naturally still an arduous task, but judging from what has already been revealed, it can be asserted that the light will surely come, and it will certainly not repeat the mistakes of history.

### The Soviet Union Absolutely Supports the Joint Declaration of Britain and the United States, and the Democratic Front Is Becoming More Solid, With the Confidence to Defeat Nazi Dominance

TASS Moscow, 17th – Regarding the joint declaration of Britain and the United States, the "Pravda" today commented, "In essence, the British-American declaration is full of strong determination to win victory over Hitler and destroy Nazism. All nations that love freedom and oppose the brutal Nazis will surely warmly welcome this declaration. The meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill has extremely important political significance. The talks between the leaders of Britain and the United States show that the cooperation between the two countries and all anti-Nazi countries is becoming more extensive and consolidated. The decisions made by Roosevelt and Churchill have given Hitler a new blow, and at the same time have increased Germany's isolation in the international community. The expansion of British-American cooperation has promoted the unity of anti-Hitler forces, which is of great importance. The conclusion of the Soviet-British military agreement and the Soviet-American economic agreement, as well as further cooperation between Britain and the United States, will enable us to complete the glorious task of liberating mankind from the threat of Hitler. Hitler is now against the three most powerful countries in the world, and these three major powers already have the cooperation of all people who love freedom and have suffered from fascist oppression. The further consolidation of the anti-Hitler democratic front has confirmed Stalin's words. Stalin once said, 'In this great war, we will gain loyal allies in Europe and the Americas (including the Germans oppressed by Hitler). Our war will be mixed with the struggle for independence and freedom in Europe and the Americas, and become a united front against the threat of Hitler.' The Soviet people absolutely support the joint declaration of British and American political leaders to strengthen the anti-Hitler struggle. After the declaration is issued, there should be more extensive and practical steps to destroy fascist aggressors and Nazi tyranny. The Soviet people deeply believe that the united strength of the people who love freedom will surely bring the war to a victorious end."

Chongqing Welcomes It – Reuters, Chongqing, 17th

The Central Daily News welcomes the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration, saying that August 14, 1941, will be a memorial day for world peace and construction, because the closer and more determined cooperation between democratic countries will surely resolve the aggressor countries as soon as possible.

Chongqing - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement regarding the declaration of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill: The Chinese government and people warmly welcome it. "President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill's joint declaration, which lists the basic goals of resisting aggression, is not only a statement for democratic countries, but also expresses the wishes of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people for a truly new world order. Even among the people of the Axis countries, there must be many sympathizers. And the plan of this main point is deeply in line with the principles of the Kuomintang and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's idea of a world commonwealth. This is what China is pleased with. The construction of the post-war world is more difficult than winning the war. The restoration of the freedom of the conquered nations, the economic cooperation between countries, and the improvement of living standards, and the establishment of a permanent organization for overall security, all require the supreme efforts and firm political talents of the democratic countries and their leaders. China is prepared to bear its due responsibilities in this regard, just as it has spared no unprecedented sacrifices in manpower and material resources for more than four years to express its arduous obligations and has never slackened. China is convinced that the last elimination of world aggression forces, the shortcut is to strengthen the encirclement of the Far East, and first defeat Japan, and this kind of this encirclement structure, Japan is the only architect.

US Trade Has a Huge Surplus

United Press, Washington, 17th - The Department of Commerce announced yesterday that the total value of US exports in the first six months of this year was US$2,093,366,000, while the value of imports was only US$499,195,000.

### Britain Solemnly Denies Using Military Force to Threaten Thailand and Declares That It Has Not Made Any Demands

Reuters, Singapore, 17th - British Far East Commander-in-Chief Sir Robert Brooke-Popham issued a formal statement today regarding the rumors spread by the Japanese that he had threatened Thailand with the use of force, saying, "I solemnly deny these rumors, which are completely unfounded. I strongly agree with the statement made yesterday by the British Minister to Thailand, Sir Josiah Crosby, that we have not made any demands on the Thai government."

Reuters, Bangkok, 17th - British Minister to Thailand Sir Josiah Crosby told Reuters reporters yesterday, "In order to prevent the spread of continued malicious arguments, I hereby declare that the British government has not made any demands of any kind on the Thai government."

New US Minister to Thailand Praises China

Washington, 16th - The newly appointed US Minister to Thailand, Edwin Stanton Peck, met with the Central News Agency reporter alone today and expressed his belief that the United States, China, and Thailand will play an important role in the future peace of the Pacific. Peck served in China for 30 years and is now transferred to a country close to China, so he is very pleased with this trip. Peck used to be a counselor at the US Embassy in China and felt most satisfied with his service in China, especially working tirelessly to promote the friendship between China and the United States. Peck was born in China and began his diplomatic career in 1906. Therefore, he said that he had witnessed the increasing growth of China's national power and had followed the Chinese government from Nanjing to Hankou, and then from Hankou to Chongqing. He has had many experiences of being bombed by Japanese planes. He expresses his admiration for the courage and determination of Chinese officials and people and said that he is convinced that China will win in this war. The newly appointed Minister to Australia, Nelson Trusler Johnson, who is currently waiting in San Francisco to be transported to Australia, also sent Peck a telegram of congratulations on the 12th. The New York Evening Post editorial also praised Peck as one of the most capable and professional diplomats in the country, with special experience in Far East issues. The newspaper continued, "The State Department also believes that Peck is one of the most worldly-wise, astute, and capable diplomats in all Chinese diplomatic circles, and is rich in experience on Chinese issues. His rise to prominence is due to his complete grasp of Far East issues. He will take a plane to Bangkok to take office." (16th telegram)

US War Equipment Production Is Increasing Sharply and Oil Production Will Be Increased to Supply China and Britain

United Press, Washington, 17th - The Department of Commerce briefly described the commercial situation in the United States yesterday, saying that the production of military supplies now occupies an important part of the country's total production, which shows the progress of the national defense program. The Department of Commerce report stated that the production of aircraft is expected to triple that of 1940, and the production of tanks will also increase by 300% during the same period. Reuters, New York, 17th - National Defense Petroleum Coordinator Harold L. Ickes said yesterday that the adequacy of gasoline supply can determine the victory of the overseas war. He believes that the US oil industry will be able to quickly double its oil refining capacity to fully supply the oil needed for aircraft. Oil industry representatives and Petroleum Administration officials met last week and have agreed on preliminary investigation methods. If the United States does not greatly increase its oil refining capacity, the United States will not be able to continue to build and use thousands of aircraft, and at the same time will not be able to supply the needs of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

### Four Years of Chinese Warfare: Unity Among Provinces, Determined to Repel Aggression and Rebuild China; People Now Have a Favorable Impression of Soldiers

London - The Times reports that four years of war have brought about fundamental changes in China. One of the most significant lessons the Chinese have learned from their arduous struggles is that the salvation of the country lies solely in their own efforts. Another change is the wealth of the Chinese interior, where the central government is rapidly establishing a great fortress with industrial and transportation resources. A third historical change is the elimination of provincialism; the animosity between provinces has been replaced by a common unity, determined to first repel aggression and then rebuild China. In addition, the people's attitude towards soldiers has also changed. Those who once feared the army like snakes and scorpions now see it as the savior in the government. The Chinese are still fighting on the battlefield because they cannot accept the idea of defeat. Although the Japanese deny that China is fighting for democracy, the Chinese instinctively feel that their struggle is for the right to autonomy. This "awakening" has, as a result of the war, expanded to the world outside of China. It is no longer surprising to find schoolchildren or farmers in the Chinese interior expressing their opinions on China's place in the world war. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### American Writer Ernest Hemingway and Wife Enjoy Trip to Mountainous Defense Line (1)

Famous American writer Ernest Hemingway and his wife traveled from Hong Kong to Shao this spring by plane, and then by car, horse, and boat, overcoming many difficulties to reach the front lines for inspection. They were deeply impressed by the strong morale of the Chinese. They described their inspection experience in detail via Pan-Pacific Radio Live and Collier's magazine. The photos were taken by the famous writer Ernest Hemingway, and the text was written by Hemingway's wife, Ms. Gellhorn.

Recent Photos of Ernest Hemingway and Wife

From Hong Kong to Shao

We stepped onto the riverbank and ran through the mud. Near the front of a bamboo house, a small squad of soldiers stood in the rain. Facing the squad of soldiers were eight grooms, wearing large conical straw hats that could also be used as umbrellas, oilcloth coats, shorts, and straw sandals. They held the reins of seven horses; the eighth horse was originally a racehorse from Hong Kong. The soldiers, grooms, and horses were all shivering in the cold rain, and water dripped from their bodies into the soft, muddy ground.

After the rain-soaked troops saluted us, they mounted their horses and set off. The horse I was riding suddenly lost its temper, leaping like a child, knocking our interpreter down, who could only stand in the mud. The horses lost their tempers, the coolies hit the horses' noses, and whistled sharply. The horses let out a long neigh, trying to bite the grooms. We proceeded in single file along a slippery path. Each groom always ran in front of the horse. The movements of the eight horses were as turbulent as a steed in a gymnasium. The heavy rain soaked our clothes. The mountain stream suddenly seemed to swell in the rain, as if to wash away some of the dirty clothes here. We ran along the small path, lowered our heads to avoid the wet bushes, dodged low-hanging branches, and raised our legs to avoid getting wet as we forded the stream. The group moved quietly in the rain.

We were setting off for the front lines of a certain war zone. Five days ago, we arrived at the Hong Kong airport in the dark of night. We waited there for three hours for the weather to improve. Later, the weather report came, saying that planes could not take off in Nanxiong, because of thick clouds and poor visibility. Therefore, the flight was canceled. The next day, we took off in a sky covered with low clouds, and after an hour and a half, passing through towering mountains and the Japanese-occupied area, we landed in the mud in the rear of China. We managed to get a dilapidated car, and then we and five other Chinese people got into the car and meandered along a yellow dirt road, arriving at Shaoguan at dusk. The hotel where we stayed was called "Shaoguang." The rented room had a small lounge furnished with several bamboo chairs, a table, two kerosene lamps, and a spittoon. Behind it was a windowless bedroom with two beds. Further back, a small door led to the bathroom, which was equipped with a washbasin, a spittoon, and a mirror. We opened the bedspreads and mosquito nets (although it was cold now, there were still many mosquitoes, slow-flying mosquitoes with their hind legs curled up – a type of malarial mosquito). We were very happy to settle in this "palace."

The next day, the commander-in-chief of the war zone here invited us to lunch. He looked like a gentle and happy bodhisattva. We drank tea, bowed five times as customary, and chatted for a while in a dimly lit stone house. After this formal ceremony, we dined with the chief of staff and others. The dishes were sumptuous, with shark fin soup, preserved eggs, bamboo shoots, and steamed buns. Even in the army, where drinking alcohol was strictly prohibited, some wine was always prepared for guests. So the commander-in-chief and several officers toasted everyone one by one. When we drank wine, we wished the two great leaders of China and the United States, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Roosevelt, good health and wished us a smooth journey.

The commander-in-chief drank many glasses of wine and sweated profusely, and two officers also had flushed faces. The interpreter was also drunk, and Hemingway was very happy to say when toasting the final victory of the Chinese army, stuttering and unable to say a word. Because the taste of the wine was strong, I should have emptied my glass, but I only sipped half of it. Hemingway drank heartily and without restraint, which saved us a lot of face. Later, the commander-in-chief said in Chinese that the wine jars were empty. The drinking contest finally ended. Everyone laughed heartily, and the banquet ended in joy.

### The War on the Soviet Fronts Has Reached Its Most Intense Stage; Germany is Trying its Utmost to Achieve Victory Before the Cold Season; Nikolaev Reportedly Occupied by Germany

Reuters, London, 17th - The large-scale war in southern Ukraine is still underway. The situation there is quite unclear. Neither side's communiqués yesterday revealed the truth. However, the army under the command of Soviet General Butny is still able to fight back bravely, which shows that the victories boasted by the Germans in the past few days are not entirely credible. Because the general's subordinates still maintain their ability to fight, unlike what the Germans said about their rout. Yesterday, the German war report on Ukraine did not mention any place names, only saying that the war in the east is proceeding smoothly according to plan. The land lost by the Soviets in Ukraine has industrial and agricultural value, which cannot be ignored. But how much of a price has Germany really paid? According to the disclosures in the German newspapers in the past three days, one general, five battalion commanders, seventeen artillery captains, and twenty-nine detachments have died. These numbers are of course only a small part of the total number of deaths. However, the heavy losses of the German army can also be seen from this. In some places, the German army seems to have been forced to abandon the old trick of densely charging into the Soviet positions with a large number of tanks, and has resumed the old method of tanks, infantry, and artillery supporting each other, because the tank squadrons lost contact with the support after going deep alone, resulting in many losses. Germany started its offensive against the Soviet Union with 170 divisions, including 60 mobile mechanized divisions, and tank troops accounted for 26 divisions. According to Soviet estimates, no less than 15 of these 60 divisions have been destroyed.

Reuters, London, 17th - Reuters correspondent in Moscow, Lei, said that the Soviet communiqué on Friday night mentioned fierce fighting along the entire line, but did not specify areas or locations, only saying that it has now reached one of the most intense scenes in the war. Soviet newspapers said yesterday that fierce battles were launched on not only one front, which shows that Hitler wants to use all his strength to achieve victory before the cold season arrives. Moscow had a very weak air raid yesterday morning after two days without alerts. This shows that German aircraft are busy on the battlefield. Hitler's alleged personal command on the Eastern Front further indicates the importance Germany attaches to the current war. The most attention is paid to the Ukrainian front. According to war reports from yesterday afternoon, the war on Friday night was extremely tenacious. The Smolensk position is slightly stabilized. The Germans are remembered for digging trenches there to consolidate themselves. Their main force is advancing fiercely towards the Soviet industrial areas and transportation lines, not only wanting to hinder Soviet supplies, but also to disrupt the Soviet economic life. The Germans are eager to cut off the Nikolaev area, obviously wanting to seize the grain stored there, and because the area has important naval shipyards. There is currently no clear evidence that the German army has invaded the iron industry area in the Nikolaev Bay. It is expected that the Soviet army will definitely defend the iron industry area after abandoning the western Ukrainian agricultural area. Responsible Soviet officials have not said that a large number of Soviet soldiers have been captured, which shows that the Soviet retreat is well-organized. The Germans also planned to invade the railway from Moscow to Leningrad, but have not yet succeeded. It will be known in a few days whether the German army has extended its transportation lines and needs a little time to rest. Guerrilla warfare is still in progress, especially in the northwest, because the northwest has more forests, which is more conducive to guerrilla warfare than plains.

TASS, Moscow, 17th - The Soviet Information Bureau issued the following war report: "On the 16th, fierce fighting took place on the entire Soviet-German front. The fighting in the south was particularly fierce. Our air force inflicted heavy blows on the enemy."

TASS, Moscow, 17th - On the night of the 15th, the Soviet Air Force once again attacked Berlin and the Stettin area, dropping incendiary and high-explosive bombs on military and industrial targets, causing large fires. All Soviet aircraft returned safely to their defenses.

Havas, Berlin, 17th - The General Command announced this morning that the German and Hungarian allied forces have already occupied the Soviet Black Sea port of Nikolaev, which is located about 100 miles northeast of the port of Odessa.

### Germany Declares Relentless Bombing of Retreating Soviet Troops

United Press, Berlin, 17th - Authoritative German sources said yesterday that the massive Soviet war has reached the end of its eighth week. Soviet Marshal Butny is now exhausting his available troops in an attempt to establish a new defense line east of the Dnieper River. This defense line includes the industrial area of the Donets Basin east of Ukraine. At the same time, according to German sources, the Red Army is making every effort to withdraw the remaining troops from western Ukraine, while the Germans are relentlessly and continuously bombing the Soviet troops surrounded in the "pocket" on the Dnieper River bridges in an effort to prevent their retreat. It is also said that the German air force is also assisting in the continuous bombing of troop carriers attempting to withdraw a portion of the Soviet troops from Odessa and Nikolaev. The German News Agency said that on Friday, the German army had encircled the strong Soviet troops in southern Ukraine in a new encirclement. The exact number of Soviet losses in manpower and materials in the area is currently unknown. It also said that in another area of the same front, the Soviet army suffered heavy losses and twenty people were captured, and six cannons, fourteen flat-shooting cannons, and four infantry cannons were lost.

### Germany Intensifies Attack on Leningrad; Ukraine Also in Fierce Fighting

Reuters, Stockholm, 17th - According to news from Berlin, the German offensive against Leningrad is intensifying, especially in the northeast. Military sources say that the entire territory of Ukraine between the Dnieper River and the Black Sea has multiple Soviet troops surrounded, but the surrounded area is quite large, so the Soviet troops can still move freely. According to Norwegian news, railway transportation is greatly restricted to carry German wounded soldiers from northern Finland exclusively.

United Press, Berlin, 17th - A German military spokesman announced last night that German armored units and mechanized units launched a new offensive in the central region yesterday, continuing the lightning strikes that advanced approximately 225 to 300 miles in Ukraine over the past week, and advanced towards the Soviets. According to the Germans, the battle of Ukraine is advancing in a three-pronged formation, attempting to break through the large pocket positions of Marshal Butny's army. It is reported that the army of a certain formation is partly composed of Romanian troops, advancing south along the Dniester River, threatening Odessa. The second formation is advancing south along the Bug River from the direction of Uman, threatening Nikolaev on the Black Sea. The third advance is advancing southeast from Uman. According to the German claim, it has occupied the iron ore area of ​​Krivoy Rog, which has clearly threatened Dnepropetrovsk. The German spokesman said that each road has advanced more than 250 miles in the past week, and he believes that the position of Marshal Butny's army is extremely dangerous.

### Britain Uses Flying Fortresses to Bomb Brest; British and German Aircraft Bomb Each Other Fiercely

United Press, London, 17th - The Flying Fortresses shipped from the United States bombed the Brest dockyards again yesterday morning, and the British Air Force also flew to the coastal areas of French territory across the Strait yesterday during the day. Authoritative sources said that as a result of the air battle, 19 enemy aircraft were shot down, and four British aircraft were also missing.

United Press, London, 17th - British and German aircraft formations bombed each other fiercely yesterday. According to the United Press correspondent in Folkestone, the British Air Force raided the German-occupied areas of Europe yesterday, lasting all afternoon. Countless bombers and fighters participated in the bombing. In addition to bombing northern France, they also flew over the North Sea. On Tuesday, the British and German Air Force, together with the Flying Fortresses, made a fierce daylight raid on Cologne across the North Sea. An official communiqué stated that a small number of German aircraft arrived on the British coast on Friday evening and made sporadic air raids. One or two aircraft flew inland, causing minor losses in northwestern England, East Anglia, and eastern Scotland, and some deaths and injuries in some places.

### British Aircraft Attack German Convoy; Dutch Submarines Cooperate with Britain to Sink Axis Ships

Reuters, Cairo, 17th - The Middle East Air Force Command issued a communiqué last night saying that on Friday, the British naval air force attacked an enemy convoy in the Mediterranean and achieved great success. Five enemy ships were escorted by several destroyers. When the British aircraft attacked, three enemy ships and one destroyer were hit by torpedoes. One of them, loaded with 6,000 tons, exploded instantly. Another ship, loaded with about 3,000 tons, was also hit and leaned to one side. It is estimated that these two ships and one destroyer have sunk, because according to reconnaissance aircraft reports, only three merchant ships were seen entering the port of Tripoli.

United Press, London, 17th - The Dutch official news agency said yesterday that a Dutch submarine, in cooperation with the British Navy, sank an enemy supply ship of 5,000 tons in the Mediterranean, and also sank an enemy liner of approximately 1,000 tons. It also said that Dutch submarines have recently destroyed 26,000 tons of enemy ships.

Reuters, London, 17th - The Ministry of Aviation announced today that last night British aircraft bombed the Rhineland and Ruhr in bad weather. The main targets were the docks of Cologne, Düsseldorf, Duisburg, Rotterdam, and Ostend, which were also attacked by British aircraft. Thirteen aircraft were missing. One German fighter was also shot down by a British bomber.

### Britain and the Soviet Union Warn the Iranian Government Again

Reuters, London, 17th - According to sources here, the British and Soviet envoys to Iran have once again drawn the Iranian government's attention to the fact that the British and Soviet governments are very concerned about the excessive number of Germans in Iranian territory.

### Memories of Visiting Tagore (4)

— Xu Baoqian

Tagore's works are numerous, and he became famous early in his life. He used Bengali exclusively for his writing, and only began writing in English at the age of fifty, and his hand-translated Gitanjali became famous throughout the universe. Tagore's English literary works include:

International University

Shantiniketan was originally a wasteland, a place where thieves roamed. One day in 1863, Tagore's father came here and was suddenly moved, uttering a prayer: "It is the place where I live, the music of my heart, the home of my spirit. So I will build a tent here as a place of prayer." The thieves were moved by his father and gave up their swords to follow him. To this day, a stone tablet stands in one corner of the school, inscribed with these words. In 1901, Tagore founded a school in Shantiniketan, gathering five or six students. In 1918, the Academy of Art was established, and in the same year, the Graduate School was established. In 1921, it was formally reorganized and renamed International University. In 1922, the Rural Reconstruction Institute was established, and in 1937, the Chinese Academy was established, headed by Mr. Tan Yunshan.

School Life

The school takes nature as its environment, and classes are mostly held outdoors in the forest. Tagore believed that the best teachers to inspire children are forests, mornings and evenings, moonlight, wind and rain. Every morning and evening, teachers and students pray under the forest, singing hymns to praise God. The purpose of his education is to harmonize the relationship between the individual and the group, nature, and God. The dormitory arrangements separate men and women. Each dormitory has a teacher who lives with the students. Class time is from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day. In the evening, there are group games and various literary competitions. On the night of every full moon, all the teachers and students in the school are treated to a meal prepared by the female students. And the outdoor dance games of the female students are especially appreciated. The whole school adopts a co-educational system, but the female students have separate household affairs and other classes, and there are also extracurricular activities groups. In terms of teaching, the whole school is divided into the headquarters, that is, primary and secondary schools, universities, and graduate schools. These are described below:

Primary and Secondary Schools

For ages six to sixteen, the contact between teachers and students is extremely close. Each class must not exceed fifteen students. The curriculum pays special attention to the study of plants near the school site, in order to train children's observation skills. Older children must also come into contact with the residents of the village. In addition, books, handicrafts, and music are also very important. The handicraft course includes manufacturing daily necessities, gardening, roads, woodworking, textiles, and nails, wood carving, and painting.

University Department

There are two purposes: one is to cultivate profound literary scholarship, and the other is to improve students' skills for making a living. The history curriculum does not focus on politics and war, but on the achievements in culture of each period. Special attention is paid to the relationship between India and the outside world. All university students must understand current affairs and have insight into the social conditions and emerging movements of various countries. The Rural Reconstruction Institute has various industrial and agricultural courses. The Academy of Art, since its establishment in 1918, has become one of the main art colleges in the country. The works of art of this academy have formed their own school. On the one hand, it preserves the inherent artistic spirit of India, and at the same time absorbs the strengths of art from various countries. Its murals are especially famous.

### Shanghai Situation Unusually Stable, Can Ensure Neutral Status, People of All Countries Must Cooperate, U.S. Military Maintenance Absolutely Will Not Withdraw

The joint Anglo-American declaration, indicating that the two countries will take further concerted action, has formed a great force for stabilizing the world, and the democratic camp has also been strengthened by this, enough to curb the spread of the fierce flames of aggressive countries and eliminate them. The environment of Shanghai has been surrounded by aggressive forces for several years, especially the southward deployment in recent months, which has increased the possibility of a new war in the Pacific, making Shanghai's position precarious. Under this quiet situation, people of insight have loudly called for the United Kingdom and the United States to eradicate the remnants of appeasement, and to no longer condone or tolerate the Far East situation and the possible crises and threats Shanghai may encounter, but to choose the most effective theory and practice to maintain Shanghai's traditional neutral position of a hundred years. Now that the United Kingdom and the United States have issued a historic declaration guaranteeing human happiness and peace, it is tantamount to the most serious warning to those who play with fire, causing them to be wary.

Maintaining Shanghai's Six Major Principles The above opinion was expressed by a foreign leader in Shanghai to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency. According to him, based on the eight principles of the Anglo-American Joint Declaration, we have formulated a declaration to guarantee Shanghai's status: (1) Shanghai must not be sacrificed under the ambition of any country to expand its power and seize territory; (2) Shanghai's territory belongs to China and must not be changed without the will of the people; (3) The Shanghai Concession authorities should respect the people's right to choose the form of the Concession administrative organs, and the administrative power of the Concession should maintain its traditional form and not allow any country to control or manipulate it; (4) Shanghai's import and export trade must be unrestricted and free in order to meet the needs of economic prosperity; (5) The countries related to the sea should cooperate in all aspects to cope with the difficulties of the times and ensure economic progress and social peace; (6) After China's victory, Shanghai should restore the peaceful state before the war, and the people should live and work in peace, with guaranteed life, property, and freedom, abundant and without fear.

Chinese People Should Have National Consciousness In short, in order to make the above six principles sacred and inviolable, the five million Chinese and Western people in Shanghai must always have the highest degree of vigilance. On the Western side, under the leadership of the United Kingdom and the United States, they should work together, unite, and cooperate. On the Chinese side, they should enhance their pure national consciousness and lay a solid spiritual foundation. Anyone can believe that Shanghai's legal status can only be maintained in the people's determination to avoid evil and pursue good; otherwise, the entire Shanghai is in danger of being swallowed by evil forces.

The U.S. Military Stationed in Shanghai Will Never Withdraw Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun suddenly published a message that the soldiers of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai would all withdraw from Shanghai. It stated that the soldiers of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai had recently secretly prepared to withdraw, and a part of them would be withdrawn to the United States and the Philippines on the 25th of this month, which shows that the situation in the Far East is already in a state of urgency. According to authoritative foreign sources in this port, the reporter of the Pingming News Agency said that this news is probably the same as the past mistaken purchase of British commercial properties in this area as the United Kingdom's withdrawal from Shanghai. It is clear that there are other intentions. As a result of the Luoqiu Conference, the United States' position in the Far East has obviously been enhanced. The United States will never give up its interests in Shanghai. The U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai is purely for protecting the interests of the American expatriates here. If, as rumored by a certain party, the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai is about to withdraw, it would be a precursor to the United States giving up its interests in Shanghai. Its illogicality is self-evident.

Changes in Officers of the Fourth Regiment Seth of the U.S. Naval Medical Corps has been ordered to come to Shanghai to serve as the commander of the Surgical Medical Corps of the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, to replace Commander Pan Leiqi, who has been in office for many years and is leaving Shanghai. It is learned that the commander arrived in this city on the 13th of this month from Manila aboard the President Coolidge, which was officially announced by the Fourth Marine Regiment yesterday. It is learned that after graduating from the California Medical University in 191x, the commander joined the U.S. Navy Medical Corps and served in the Marine Corps. Before serving in Shanghai, the commander had served in the U.S. Navy Department in Manila for a year. The commander of the First Battalion of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment has also been officially announced to appoint Major Pi Que as the commander. Major Pi arrived in Shanghai on the 14th of this month from San Francisco aboard the President Harrison, succeeding Commander Zha. During the First World War, Major Pi was sent overseas to lead the Sixth Marine Corps in combat and was seriously wounded. After recovering, he returned to the front line and joined forces with General Pan Xun to lead the troops in combat. For his bravery in combat, he has successively won the Silver Star Medal of Honor, as well as the Hurd Gray Yangtze Service Medal and other victory war lapel buttons. In addition, Captain Xieer and Qi Lianmu, the newly appointed captains of the Third Battalion of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment, also came to take office on the 14th aboard the President Harrison.

Japanese Believe Current Situation Can Be Maintained According to the Japanese-language Mainland News, Shanghai's trade is completely dependent on the overseas situation. Therefore, it adopts a cautious attitude towards the movements of London, Washington, and Tokyo. After the outbreak of the German-British and German-Soviet wars, Tokyo adopted a policy of continuing to maintain the status quo. The day after issuing a freeze order to British banks, British companies were unable to withdraw deposits, and it was extremely difficult to pay the salaries of their employees. Later, the restrictions were slightly relaxed, but the impact on the British side was still very significant. Among them, the control of exports by customs and the lack of ships were the most serious. At present, various American companies are in contact with the local consulate general, hoping to obtain the necessary import permits. The withdrawal of funds from various American banks is also relatively easy. However, due to the control of exports from Shanghai, ships coming to Shanghai loaded with goods have to return empty because they cannot export the goods. However, because imports are not restricted, Shanghai will still become an international supply base for materials. No matter how the prices are, there will be no problem with the supply of materials. How long can this abnormal development in wartime be maintained? This is what people are speculating about in the future.

### Gela Di Ordered to Fly to the Philippines to Prepare for Wartime Shipping, Investigate the Entire Economic Structure of the Far East, Specific Actions Will Be Taken When Necessary

Mr. Gela Di, Chairman of the U.S. Presidential Shipping Company and former Assistant Secretary of State, was ordered by President Roosevelt to come to the Far East to conduct a comprehensive economic investigation, so that the connection between the military defenses of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands can become more robust and perfect. Gela's arrival will also redistribute U.S.-British shipping to and from East Asia, so that Asian raw materials can be transported to democratic countries, and the mechanism will be improved to avoid negligence and fall into the hands of the Axis powers. It is learned that Gela is scheduled to fly from the United States to Manila tomorrow, and then inspect the Dutch East Indies and Malaya. He will also travel to the wartime Chinese capital. The Chinese government and the public here have expressed their welcome.

The Mission of This Trip Is Concentrated in the Philippines According to the New Voice News Agency's inquiry to relevant parties, Gela's mission will focus on the Philippines, in order to determine (1) the possible repercussions after the outbreak of war in the Pacific; (2) in view of the lack of ships in wartime, (A) the implementation of the U.S. Maritime Commission's micro-use of U.S. shipping orders, (B) the extent to which U.S. shipping will replace British shipping in the Far East, (C) U.S. shipping will replace British shipping in the Pacific, so as to extract tonnage and strengthen British freight in the Atlantic, (D) In view of the importance of Australian and Greek shipping in the Pacific, the needs in the event of a reduction in the export market are determined; (3) agricultural loans and other assistance to save its economy.

Adjusting the Sino-Philippine Liaison Movement When Gela Di investigates the third point, although the scope of the investigation is only for the relevant countries in the East, he will especially provide more assistance to China in terms of economics. The relationship between the Philippines and China and the needs of trade between the two countries in an emergency will also be adjusted, so that the United States can transport what China needs from the Philippines, which is closest to China, in the shortest possible time. It is learned that this matter will be assisted by Mr. Haiste, the adviser to Mr. Shayi, the U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines. Gela's stay in the Far East must be from six weeks to eight weeks.

Meetings May Be Convened in Shanghai in the Future Gela's subsequent footsteps will reach Singapore, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, India, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and Chongqing, all of which are on the inspection list. He may also come to Shanghai for a trip. Gela also plans to hold discussions with economic experts from various countries, and then list the economic assets and institutions of various places into a table, so that specific actions can be taken when taking action, such as prohibiting oil, financial cooperation, etc., or used to control shipping in the Far East and the Pacific.

Shipping Problems Are Specifically Considered On the other hand, Gela's purpose is to obtain detailed information on all the economic forces available to democratic countries in the face of the threat of war in the Pacific. As for the freezing of the implementation order, the freezing in China and against Japan are within the scope of Gela's investigation. The shipping problem of American merchants in the Far East in the future will be one of the things that will be paid attention to during this trip. After all, shipping is the lifeline in wartime. According to Gela, he graduated from St. Mary's College in Baltimore, USA, in his early years, and then taught at New York. In 1919, he served as a commercial counselor and went to the United Kingdom, and was later promoted to Assistant Secretary of State. At the beginning of this year, he was appointed as the general manager of the U.S. Presidential Shipping Company.

Confucius' Birthday Is Approaching, Flags Are Hung to Celebrate

The 27th of this month is the birthday of the most sage and teacher Confucius. All sectors of the public in this city regard this day as a national memorial festival. According to the flag-hanging measures agreed upon by various groups and the Concession authorities, it is decided that the Blue Sky White Sun National Flag shall be hung for one day on this day. However, due to the special environment of Shanghai and the extraordinary period, it is not intended to celebrate the ceremony in a big way, but to engage in spiritual commemoration.

Offices Are Closed The Jianghai Customs, Post Office, First Special High Court, Second Court, silver and money industry member firms and villages, money industry reserve, rice market, Public Works Bureau, Municipal Council, and their affiliated agencies, factories, and organizations in this city have all been notified that they will be closed for one day on this day. All counties will also celebrate with flags. All levels of schools in the city, with Confucius' birthday coinciding with the third National Teachers' Day, will suspend classes and hold memorial ceremonies to explain the meaning of the memorial.

Police Alert The police authorities of the two Concessions, although Confucius' birthday is not a revolutionary memorial, but due to the special environment, are sincerely afraid that unscrupulous elements will take advantage of this memorial date to engage in illegal activities and endanger the entire security of the Concession. Therefore, it has been decided to prohibit all gatherings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities from the 25th, and strictly enforce the curfew laws. At the same time, all sectors of society are promoting the Cold Clothing Donation Movement.

Hankou French Concession Incident The Conditions Signed The Patrol of the Army and Navy by the French Side Has Been Recognized

According to news from Japanese newspapers, after the Hankou French Concession's cross-border arrest and shooting incident with the Japanese side on July 12 of this year, the Japanese side immediately lodged a protest with the French Consul General in Hankou and implemented a blockade of the French Concession. After 36 days of negotiations, the two sides finally reached a settlement on the night of the 16th of this month. From the 17th, the Japanese army will be able to freely enter and exit the French Concession. It is heard that there are a total of 18 conditions for the settlement of this matter between France and Japan, the most important of which are the following: (1) The French side recognizes that the Japanese armed forces can freely enter and exit the French Concession; (2) It is recognized that the Japanese army and navy will patrol; (3) Compensation for the losses of the victims; (4) The Japanese side will open up various places near the Concession. Afterwards, the consuls of both France and Japan made statements, saying that this solution is to "jointly prevent the recurrence of similar incidents in the future."

Train Derails Near Anting

According to a passenger who arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday, he took the Shanghai-Ningbo train to Shanghai yesterday morning. At about 11 o'clock, the train stopped suddenly near Anting. Passengers had to get off the train and walk several miles to take another train. Only a locomotive and several freight cars were seen leaning on the roadside, all of which had been destroyed. The electric wires and wooden poles on the roadside were also damaged, but pedestrians were not allowed to go to see them. The destroyed tracks were placed on the roadside. According to the villagers there, five or six plainclothes Chinese were inspecting near the area on the evening of the 16th. At about 1 o'clock, they left. At about 10 o'clock, the train approached the area and suddenly derailed.

### Shanghai Japanese Newspaper Reduces Size

Japan, due to a lack of materials and insufficient paper, has ordered domestic newspapers to reduce their size by half a page, reducing the number of pages to two large pages in the morning and evening. That is, the two Japanese newspapers in this port, the Mainland News and the Shanghai Daily News, also notified readers on the 16th that they will be implemented from the 18th. The Mainland News explained the reason as "in accordance with the national policy of saving on newspapers." In the future, the morning and evening newspapers will publish a total of one and a half pages, which is half a page smaller than before. On Sundays and memorial days, the evening newspaper will be closed. The Shanghai Daily News explained the reason as "in order to save on newspapers, maintaining the status quo is impossible." In the future, the morning newspaper will publish one page every Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, two pages will be published.

### Needy Students Long for Fellow Qinghe to Help, Ninth Record of Aid Student Visit

"Fate will make me fall into the bitter sea of dropping out of school. Suddenly, I saw the righteous act of the Shen Bao readers' scholarship, which made me so happy. I hurriedly went through the formalities, silently prayed for success, and looked forward to the arrival of the investigators every day, hoping to get sympathy and help."

This is a sincere appeal from a female student who has encountered a very unfortunate situation and whose environment will not allow her to continue her studies.

Her father was transferred to Chongqing to serve after the war broke out. Two years ago, his salary was 70 yuan. Fortunately, only she and her mother lived in Shanghai, and they lived in her aunt's house, so there was no rent and the expenses were very small. Relying on the small amount of money sent by her father and the rewards earned by her mother's needlework, they worked hard to maintain their livelihood, and sometimes they could even have a little surplus. Unexpectedly, her father suddenly lost contact in the spring of last year, and several registered letters did not receive a reply. As of now, there is still no way to get the exact news of her father's safety. Of course, the economic aspect has become a problem. All the meager savings have been completely used up, and now the food also depends on the not-so-rich aunt's house. Under such circumstances, how difficult it is for her to continue her studies!

When her mother stated their situation, her voice was trembling and her eyes were red; her daughter lowered her head and seemed to be silently experiencing the pain of her encounter.

"Hoping for the help of the gentlemen is as urgent as hoping to get news from my father!"

This is the sincere message of this female student who is very eager to study and whose environment will not allow her to continue her studies. (C)

A Commemorative Process

A top student in a church girls' school; she has experienced a thorny journey in life. The following is a commemorative process in her life:

The ruthless artillery fire destroyed her hometown, and the few properties in her family were reduced to ashes. At this time four years ago, in the midst of extreme chaos in the local situation and extremely inconvenient public transportation, she followed her parents and led her younger brother, fleeing from the war zone - her hometown - and came to Shanghai. But Shanghai had no relatives or friends to rely on, and no ability to rent a house, so they had to enter the refugee camp run by the Xujiahui Catholic Church and live the life of refugees. Fortunately, there were also refugee school facilities in the refugee camp, and she continued her studies in the refugee camp. A year later, the war in one corner of Shanghai had calmed down, and the camp was disbanded. Of course, they were no exception. However, because of her excellent grades in the school, she was specially promoted by a priest of the Catholic Church and sent to a nearby church girls' school to continue her studies. All the expenses for tuition, food, and accommodation were provided by this priest. It can be said that she was able to study with peace of mind for these two years thanks to this priest. Who knew that good times would not last long. The priest was suddenly ordered to be transferred in the spring of this year. The succeeding priest ended her preferential treatment because she was not a Catholic. The school also rejected her preferential treatment for the same reason. From this semester, everything must be the same as other students, paying tuition, food, and accommodation fees. How can she raise this considerable amount! Although her father, after returning to her hometown, was engaged in reorganizing her old business, she has been able to barely maintain the expenses of the family. However, she still can't cope with the huge educational expenses of her daughter. After her father pieced together a number of money, but it was still far from the required expenses, so she had to apply to this newspaper for a portion of the tuition fees, hoping to get sympathy and help, so as to fulfill her wish to study.

Sincere attitude, upright character, especially the advantages of this student. (C)

Japan Plans to Establish Additional Judicial Consuls in Shanghai

The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently decided to add judicial consuls, with 28 consuls and vice-consuls and 26 clerks, in view of the increase in the number of Japanese residents in China and the sharp increase in litigation cases, which is not enough for the original judicial consular personnel. It is learned that Shuntaro Sato, the second chief of the Treaty Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been assigned to come to Shanghai in the middle of next month to contact the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai regarding the establishment of a judicial consul general.

Coal Briquette Price Limit Abolished, Plan to Sell at Flat Price

Since the price of coal briquettes has been increasing frequently, the common people have been seriously threatened. The Shanghai Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association has decided to convene an executive and supervisory committee meeting today to discuss a good plan, and has formally issued a notice yesterday. According to the members of the association, the existing five major coal briquette factories dare to try to withdraw from the association on the pretext of wanting to increase prices. However, the association has always been consistent in seeking the welfare of all members, and will never allow such people to act against the trend. The points to be discussed at the association's meeting that day are as follows: (1) plan to continue to lead all colleagues and host flat-priced coal briquettes; (2) recommend that the two Concession authorities improve the coal briquette evaluation method and expect to achieve effective results; (3) discuss specific measures to punish illegal coal profiteers.

### A Study of the Origins of Taoism Yang Zhongyi

At the 20th lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Lecture Society, Mr. Yang Zhongyi lectured on "A Study of the Origins of Taoism," and Mr. Ding Zhonghu lectured on "Methods for Preventing and Curing Diseases." The two gentlemen alternated their lectures, attracting the special attention of the audience, resulting in an exceptionally good and sustained atmosphere. Mr. Yang's "A Study of the Origins of Taoism" stated: The Doctrine of the Mean speaks of "cultivating the Way," and Confucius said "one thread runs through it all." The Way was originally a public name. Zhuangzi's "Tianxia" chapter began with the techniques of the Way, and Sima Qian's "Essentials of the Six Schools" concluded with morality, but neither of these is the Taoism of the Han History. The man of Lacquer Garden believed that "a scholar with limited views finds self-concealment; the techniques of the Way were fractured into methods," while Lan Ling believed that "the essence of the Way is constant yet ever-changing; the limitations of the six masters are all but a corner of the Way." Even broad and great perfect men like Lao Dan, Meng Ke only said, "The ancient techniques of the Way exist in what they do," not daring to immediately approve it as the Way of inner sagehood and outer kingship.

Since Ban Gu adopted Liu Xiang's "Seven Summaries" in the "Treatise on Literature and Art," he began to regard Huang-Lao as Taoism. Later, Xiang Kai of the Later Han Dynasty transmitted the saying "Huang-Lao and Buddhism are equally revered." Tao Hongjing of the Southern History Biography referred to "Taoist people and Taoist masters" together. Even monks were called Taoist people, indicating that "Tao" was a public name for the three teachings. Emperor Qin and Emperor Wu of the Han both favored magicians. Huan Tan's "New Treatise" still referred to magicians, indicating that the name "Taoism" did not yet exist.

During Wang Mang's time, there was a Taoist priest named Ximen Junhui. The "Biography of Fifth Lun" of the Later Han Dynasty began to use the term "Taoist priest." Xiang Kai's biography states that during the reign of Emperor Shun, Gong Chong of Langye presented his teacher Yu Ji's divine book of one hundred and seventy chapters, titled "Book of Great Peace and Purity." The "Biography of Zhang Lu" in the "Records of the Three Kingdoms" states that "Ling, the ancestor, studied Taoism at Huming Mountain and created Taoist books." Chapter 28 of the "Cloud Satchel of the Seven Tablets" states that he "transmitted it to Celestial Master Zhang Daoling, who received the Way of Orthodox Oneness and Covenantal Majesty." Song Chen Yuanjing's "Extensive Records of Seasonal Observances" contains the ancestral biography of the Han Celestial Master. The "Tea Fragrance Chamber's Three Jottings," Volume 18, Tian Shi article cites it, as well as Zi Heng and Sun Lu. The "Biography of Huangfu Song" in the Later Han Dynasty mentions "Zhang Jiao of Julu," who called himself the Way of Great Peace. The "Dian Lue" states that "Zhang Xiu was in Hanzhong" and called himself the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. After Jiao was executed and Xiu perished, Lu occupied Hanzhong and later surrendered to Cao Cao, calling it the Way of the Celestial Master. His son Sheng moved to Longhu Mountain in Jiangxi, continuing the lineage of Taoism. In the eighth year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era of the Song Dynasty, Zhang Zhengshui of Longhu Mountain was bestowed the title of Master of Emptiness and Tranquility, and the Shangqing Temple was built. In the thirteenth year of the Yuan Dynasty, the sixty-sixth generation Zhang Zongyan was summoned, bestowed the title of Celestial Master Who Inherits from the Han Dynasty, and made a spirit-responsive, peaceful, and harmonious perfect man, hereditarily governing the Taoism of Jiangnan. It has been passed down to the current Zhang Enpu, the sixty-third generation. His father, Xiaochu, was a licentiate who excelled in poetry and lyrics. In the winter of Guihai, Dr. Li Jiabai invited him to Shangxian Hall to lecture on the true principles of Taoism. At that time, I was the chief representative of the Confucian Teaching of the International Educational Affairs Federation, and thus had the opportunity to exchange verses with him.

The "Biography of Wang Yizhi" of the Jin Dynasty states that "the Wang family served the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice of the Zhang family for generations." The "Biography of Sun En" states that he "served the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice for generations. His uncle Tai was killed by Wang Daizi of Kuaiji. En attacked Kuaiji, harming the Inspector Wang Ningzhi." Zhong Rong's "Shi Pin" (Poetry Ranking) mentions Xie Lingyun, whose family, because it was difficult to have sons and grandsons, entrusted him to the Du Zhi established by the Celestial Master's Taoism. He returned at the age of fifteen, hence the name "Guest Child."

Taoism began in the Three Kingdoms period and flourished in the Six Dynasties period. The "Collected Explanations" of the "Chronicle of Emperor Qin" in the "Historical Records" quotes the "Inner Records of the First Ying of the Perfect Man of Taiyuan": "The great-grandfather Meng," which is the ballad that says, "The immortals obtained were the first made of thatch, riding dragons rising into the Great Purity, continuing for generations, arriving in me Ying." According to the genealogy, he was the great-grandfather Meng, the great-great-grandfather Yan, the grandfather Xi, and the father Zuo. He gave birth to Lord of Destiny Ying, Lord of Established Records Gu, and Lord of Preserved Life Biao, who were called the Three Maos of the Southern Dynasties. The "Biography of Ge Hong" of the Jin Dynasty states that "his ancestral uncle Xuan obtained immortal techniques during the Wu period and taught them to Zheng Yin. Hong studied under Yin," writing "The Master Who Embraces Simplicity" in one hundred and sixty chapters, with those discussing alchemy named the Inner Chapters.

The "Biography of Tao Hongjing" of the Liang Dynasty states, "He obtained the 'Biography of Divine Immortals' by Ge Hong, which contains the 'Record of Nourishing Life.' He secluded himself in Jurong's Jurong Mountain, which is the Eighth Grotto Palace, the heaven of Jintan Huayang, the place where the Three Mao Lords of Xianyang of the Han Dynasty attained the Way." According to the "Records of Mao Mountain" and Tao Yinju's "True Declarations," the founder was Madam Wei of Mount Heng, who transmitted the "Yellow Court Classic" to Yang Yi, the chief scribe of the Situ Gongfu, which was then passed on to Xu Mu, the chief scribe of the Protectorate General, and eight generations later to the mountain recluse Tao Zhenbai. The "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" in the "Book of Wei" states that "Taoist Priest Kou Qianzhi was granted the position of Celestial Master by the Supreme Lord Lao, bestowed with twenty volumes of commandments for chanting new rituals in the clouds, and Li Puwen, the Master of the Soil, bestowed the inlaid true scripture. Emperor Taiwu revered and obeyed, changing the era name to True Lord of Great Peace. When the emperors ascended the throne, they would personally go to the Taoist altar to receive talismans," resembling the Pope of Rome. The "Remote Survey Chapter" of "The Master Who Embraces Simplicity" mentions Wei Boyang's "Inner Classic." Peng Xiao's "Preface to the Annotated Meaning of the 'Book of Correspondences'" of the Later Shu of the Five Dynasties states, "He secretly showed it to Xu Congshi of Qingzhou, who hid his name and annotated it. During the reign of Emperor Huan, it was again bestowed to Chunyu Shutong of the same commandery." Zhu Xi and Cai Yuanding emended it, naming the altered name Taoist Zou Xin of Kongtong.

According to the genealogy of true immortals, Lao Dan transmitted it to Donghua, who transmitted it to Zhongli Quan of the Han Dynasty, who transmitted it to Lü Yan of the Tang Dynasty, founding the school of golden elixir. Yan transmitted it to Liu Cao of the Liao Dynasty, whose disciple Zhang Rui was famous for his "Awakening to Reality," which was transmitted through generations to become the Seven Perfect Ones of the Southern Lineage. It was also transmitted to Jin Wang Jia, dividing into the Seven Schools of the Northern Lineage, and Qiu Changchun alone received the Yuan Ancestor's great favor, governing both monks and Taoists, called the Quanzhen Teaching, as seen in the "Distinguishing Falsehood Records" by Shi Xiangmai. Moreover, the "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" in the "History of Yuan" states that in addition to the Quanzhen and Zhengyi schools, "Liu Deren of the Jin Dynasty was transmitted five times to Li Xicheng, who was seen by Emperor Xianzong and called the True Eight Ways." "Xiao Baozhen of the Jin Dynasty transmitted the Taishang Sanyuan Fawang, teaching the Taiyi." The Taoist canon began with the books of techniques, numbers, and magic in the "Treatise on Literature" of the Han History, but the Taoist school is ultimately not Taoism.

At the end of the Han Dynasty, there was the "Classic of Great Peace." After the Jin Dynasty, Taoist scriptures were gradually compiled, as seen in the "Remote Survey Chapter" of "The Master Who Embraces Simplicity." The "Treatise on Scriptures and Books" of the "Book of Sui," Zheng Qiao's "General Treatise on Literature and Art" of the Song Dynasty, and Zhang Junfang's "Preface to the Seven Tablets of the Spiritual Box" claimed that the Heavenly Treasury Record was completed in seven treasuries. The "Detailed Annotations to the Directory of the Daoist Canon of Bright Clouds and Empyrean" divides them into the Dongzhen, Dongxuan, Dongshen, Taixuan, Taiping, Taiqing, and Zhengyi seven sections, called the Three Caverns and Four Supplements. There are also continued Taoist canons, essential extracts of the Taoist canon, etc., which are still in circulation today.

### Owner of the Grand Theater, Fan Hengde, Assaulted The bullet hit his buttocks, but his injuries are not serious. The assailant resisted arrest and died on duty.

In front of the Grand Theater on Jiujiang Road in the Public Concession, at around 1 p.m. yesterday, a sudden assassination occurred. The victim was Fan Hengde, the owner of the Grand Theater. He was shot in the right buttock on the spot. Three assailants resisted arrest while fleeing, and a Chinese police officer No. 1522 rushed to pursue them. Unfortunately, he was shot in the chest and died. Details are as follows:

Two Cars Parked At No. 663 Jiujiang Road, Fan Hengde, a native of Zhenhai, the eastern theater owner of the Grand Theater, is 41 years old and resides at No. 36, Alley 12, Weihaiwei Road (Weihai New Village). He usually has two personal cars, Nos. 672 and 671. In addition to opening the Grand Theater, Fan also runs two Zhejiang Restaurants, both of which he must visit for work.

Shot Upon Exiting the Car At around 1 p.m. yesterday, Fan was supposed to attend a friend's banquet. He took car No. 671 to the Grand Theater for work. Unexpectedly, as the car stopped in front of the theater, and Fan leaned over to get out, three men suddenly jumped out from the roadside and opened fire on Fan. Caught off guard, Fan was shot in the right buttock. Fresh blood flowed, and his white silk long gown was stained bright red. He collapsed to the ground.

Resisting Arrest and Opening Fire Seeing that their goal was achieved, the shooters quickly fled eastward into the alley next to the Grand Theater. Fan's driver, Shun Sheng, a native of Chuansha, saw his employer injured and shouted for help. The patrol police at the scene heard the alarm and rushed to pursue, whistling as they gave chase.

Teacher Training Institute for Secondary School Women's and Infant Hygiene Enrolling Students

The Ministry of Education believes that physiological hygiene is extremely important to domestic affairs, and that attention should be paid to pregnant women's hygiene, postpartum hygiene, infant care, etc., which are all related to obstetrics. Therefore, the curriculum standards for domestic affairs for junior and senior high school girls have been revised to expand the scope of teaching, so that they can obtain basic obstetrical knowledge and acquire knowledge and skills in family medical care and hygiene. The midwifery education circle in this city believes that these teachers need special training to truly benefit secondary school students. Therefore, Wu Yichu, Zhang Senyu, Zhu Yanggao, Qu Shaohang, Yang Yuanji, and others have initiated the establishment of a Teacher Training Institute for Secondary School Women's and Infant Physiological Hygiene. The institute is attached to the two midwifery schools of Zhongde and Dade. The courses are taught by Cheng Mugu, Yang Yujie, Wu Yichu, Huang Zhongqiang, Zhang Senyu, Tong Zhiqing, Su Zenhsiang, Zhu Yanggao, Fei Zhonghua, Qu Shaohang, Yang Yuanji, and others from the medical community. It is heard that the main purpose of their teaching is to integrate the theories and experiences of various subjects into one furnace. Therefore, not only can those who wish to teach physiological hygiene in junior and senior high schools receive a wealth of knowledge, but also those who do not teach but perform midwifery duties can also gain unlimited experience.

### Review of Frozen Chinese Funds Chen Fengshu

The author of this article, Professor Chen Fengshu, studied economics in England in his early years. After returning to China, he worked in the financial sector and also taught at St. John's University and Datong University. As the effects of the freeze are not yet apparent and negative phenomena are frequently occurring, various parties are increasingly aware of the seriousness of this "problem." Our publication has already published multiple articles on this topic in past issues. Now, we have received Professor Chen's insightful article. We hope readers will pay attention to it. (Editor)

Significance of the United States Freezing Foreign Funds

The significance of freezing assets is that the rights to enjoy and use all movable and immovable property in the United States belonging to foreign entities are temporarily deprived. The scope of freezing can be divided into two types: one is a complete freeze, such as the freezing of funds belonging to Germany, Italy, and their occupied countries; the other is a partial freeze, such as the current freezing of assets belonging to China and Japan in the United States. This is because the United States still maintains normal international trade with China and Japan, but only for those who obtain permits and make cash purchases.

As for the purpose of freezing assets, generally speaking, it is nothing more than the following three points: (1) Freezing assets has the effect of economic sanctions, such as freezing the assets of Germany, Italy, and Japan; (2) To prevent assets from being transferred to the hands of aggressors, such as freezing the assets of Denmark, Norway, and the occupied areas of China; (3) To promote the economic policies of friendly countries, such as freezing Chinese assets in the United States at the request of the Chinese government.

The Process of Freezing Funds of Nordic Countries

The process of the United States freezing foreign assets is briefly described as follows: Since the outbreak of the European war in the Nordic countries in April of last year, the United States began to implement the freezing of funds in the United States belonging to European countries that had fallen under occupation. When German troops attacked Denmark and Norway on April 8, 1940, the United States, based on the Trading with the Enemy Act enacted on October 6, 1917, froze the assets of Denmark and Norway in the United States on April 10. Subsequently, the war expanded, and the number of countries frozen also increased. Specifically: On May 10, the US government froze the assets of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in the United States. On June 17, the US government announced the freezing of French assets in the United States. On July 15, it also announced the freezing of the assets of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania in the United States. On October 10, it also announced the freezing of Romanian assets in the United States. On March 13 of this year, the US government froze the assets of Hungary in the United States. On March 25, it announced the freezing of Yugoslav assets in the United States. On April 28, Greek assets in the United States were frozen. On June 14, the assets of Germany, Austria, Danzig, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Italy, and Albania in the United States were frozen one by one. Since the United States froze Denmark and Norway on April 10 last year until it froze the assets of China and Japan, the number of countries frozen has reached as many as 24, and the assets frozen are worth more than 600 million US dollars. In addition, the assets of Finland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Soviet Union in the United States are also subject to conditional freezing orders. After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the assets of the Soviet Union were unfrozen.

Overview of the Freezing of Chinese Funds

Since the United States and Britain successively froze Chinese and Japanese funds on July 16, the Dutch East Indies also followed suit and announced the freezing of Japanese funds in the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Japan has also taken retaliatory measures by declaring a freeze on US, British, and Dutch East Indies funds in Japan and its occupied territories. Due to space constraints, this article will only provide a brief explanation of the process of the US and British freezing of Chinese funds and its impact on China's wartime economy.

The American Freeze Is Not Thorough

The United States Department of the Treasury announced the freezing of Japanese funds on July 26, which took effect on the 27th. At the same time, the United States government, at the request of the Chinese government, announced the freezing of Chinese funds in the United States. As for the reasons for freezing Chinese funds, generally speaking, they are nothing more than the following points: (1) After the US government freezes Chinese funds in the United States, it can prevent Chinese funds from entering regions outside the United States and China; (2) To give the Chinese government the power to control all funds belonging to its people; (3) This measure can prevent the Japanese from using Chinese legal tender to obtain foreign exchange.

In order to maintain normal trade between the United States and China, the United States issued General Licenses No. 58 and 59, authorizing ten foreign banks in China to engage in foreign exchange within China, and authorizing these banks to provide financial assistance for import and export trade between any part of China (excluding Northeast China) and the United States, Latin America, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. These fourteen banks are Chase, Citibank, American International, American Express (the above four are American banks), HSBC, Standard Chartered, Mercantile, Banque de l'Indochine, Old Sassoon, New Sassoon, and Sassoon Banking Corporation (the above seven are British banks), Moscow Narodny Bank (Soviet Union), and Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, Banque de l'Union Parisienne (the above are Dutch banks). However, requests for transfer and withdrawal of blocked US dollar deposits are not permitted. The above-mentioned banks, before issuing letters of credit, accepting or paying drafts, or permitting other payments or transfers based on import and export trade, must meet the following conditions: (1) This trade must be legitimate import and export, and the value of the imported and exported goods must be equivalent to the amount of foreign exchange applied for; (2) This import and export must comply with the terms stipulated in this circular.

The United States government also sent separate circulars to China's national banks, instructing on methods. The contents of the circular issued by the US government to the four banks of China (Central Bank of China), Bank of China, Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank of China are slightly different from the circular issued to the fourteen foreign banks. The circular allows the four banks of China to buy and sell foreign exchange, but its scope is limited to those stipulated in the general circular; as for other Chinese commercial banks engaged in foreign exchange business, they can continue to engage in foreign exchange business within possible limits in the future, but foreign exchange business that has not been completed before July 26 will be handled by the Central Bank. The methods are described separately as follows:

The general circular issued by the US government to the Central Bank is No. 60. This circular authorizes the Central Bank to accept requests from the people to pay or transfer their frozen deposits to domestic banks in the name of the Central Bank, or to transfer the frozen securities to domestic banks. As for all foreign exchange bought and sold by Chinese commercial banks before July 26, the Central Bank will collect and pay on their behalf, but this collection and payment of foreign exchange refers to foreign exchange that is not on the frozen list; the deadline for this collection and payment of foreign exchange is August 15. The actual methods for this collection and payment of foreign exchange are as follows:

(1) Method for paying foreign exchange: If a Chinese commercial bank needs to pay foreign exchange, it must immediately telegraph Chase Bank in London or New York to credit it to the Central Bank of China account; at the same time, request Chase Bank in London or New York to send a telegram back to the Shanghai branch, informing the Central Bank of China in Shanghai to confirm that the payment has been received; then the Central Bank will transfer the payment to the original recipient on behalf of the applicant, but the recipient must be a citizen of an unfrozen country (Unblocked National). (2) Method for buying foreign exchange: The Central Bank, in its own name, receives the foreign exchange that the applying Chinese commercial bank should receive, and directly credits it to the account of the Chinese commercial bank. When withdrawing the deposit, it must be handled in accordance with the regulations. The general circular issued by the US government to the three banks of China, the Communications Bank, the Central Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China, is No. 61, and its contents are roughly the same as those issued to the fourteen foreign banks, so it is omitted.

Regarding Chinese commercial banks engaged in foreign exchange, without the special approval of the US government, they will not be allowed to engage in foreign exchange business again in principle. However, the US freeze on Chinese funds is not thorough, so foreign exchange business in normal import and export trade can still be conducted, but speculative transactions are absolutely not allowed.

The British Method Is More Rigorous

The British government, at the request of the Chinese government, announced the freezing of Chinese funds on July 29, and the imperial government followed suit. The British government immediately notified British commercial banks in China on July 29 that all pound deposits, bonds, and cash, whether in China or branches outside China, should be sealed. In addition, assistance is still provided for import and export trade between China and the pound sterling area, and certain foreign exchange transactions may be approved.

Regarding the method for applying for the supply of pounds sterling, the British government has authorized HSBC, Mercantile, and Standard Chartered banks. Merchants who have established accounts and whose credit behavior is deemed reliable by the managers of the three banks can apply to the three banks for the supply of foreign exchange; however, the application must specify in detail to which place and bank the payment is made, what kind of goods are purchased, and the amount required. After being approved by the managers of the three banks, a foreign exchange check is issued to allow them to use it. The method is very careful and rigorous, but the detailed method is unknown.

What is the general situation of the freezing of Chinese funds by the United States and Britain? The above is a brief description, and the differences between them will be described in detail: The British government has abolished the method for British commercial banks to pay Chinese foreign exchange depositors in legal tender, and pound deposits, bonds, and cash are all sealed together and absolutely cannot be withdrawn freely; however, American commercial banks can still pay Chinese US dollar depositors in legal tender according to the black market exchange rate, so the method of British commercial banks is more rigorous than that of American commercial banks.

Impact on the Chinese Economy

Since the United States and Britain implemented the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds, and Japan also adopted counter-freezing measures, the impact on Shanghai's general economy is self-evident. This article will only provide a general review of the trade, foreign exchange, domestic exchange, gold market, and price aspects:

Trade: The trade situation in Shanghai has not changed significantly since the freeze was implemented. Although funds are frozen, normal international trade can still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the general circular. Importers can request to purchase and settle foreign exchange from the designated fourteen banks; and exporters can also sell the foreign exchange they obtain to the fourteen banks; but the source of goods that are prohibited from trading will naturally be interrupted, and the import of necessities, if there are no other political changes, can continue to be carried out.

Foreign Exchange: Since the freezing of funds, the value of legal tender against US dollars and pounds sterling in the Shanghai black market has tended to decline. In principle, it should have risen. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following: (1) Before the funds of Japanese commercial banks were frozen, fearing that they would be unable to use them once they were frozen, they quickly and massively sold foreign exchange. After the US government issued the freezing order, it became clear that it was not as strict as expected. With the promulgation of the amending order, it became even more apparent that it was frozen but not blocked, so they re-entered, causing the foreign exchange market to tighten. (2) In the speculative frenzy, the shorts, fearing that they would not be able to obtain foreign exchange to offset their positions, had to try their best to buy in as early as possible, resulting in a further tightening of the exchange rate; thereafter, the black market exchange rate should gradually stabilize. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following two points: (1) The speculative buying and selling of foreign exchange has been restricted by the freezing order, and the pressure on the exchange rate has therefore been reduced; (2) According to the provisions of General License No. 59, future trade must be normal import and export, and non-normal imports have been reduced. Due to the two reasons mentioned above, the black market exchange rate will tend to stabilize.

Domestic Exchange: Since the United States and Britain successively announced the freezing of funds, Shanghai's bankers and financiers telegraphed their branches in the interior to sell Shanghai legal tender, causing the exchange market, which had been slightly volatile for several years, to fluctuate greatly; for example, the rise in the exchange rate on August 1 reached as much as 100 yuan; the changes in the Shanghai exchange market over the years have often been affected by Chongqing and Kunming, but this time, Shanghai took the initiative instead of being passive. It is generally believed that the exchange rate will continue to rise in the future and reach the trend of parity exchange between Shanghai and the interior; however, the facts show that this is not the case, and the exchange rate has instead tended to decline. The reason for this is that Hong Kong has become the final refuge for legal tender, and funds from the interior are moving to that place. The reasons for this are as follows: (1) Chinese in Hong Kong are free to buy Hong Kong dollars with legal tender; (2) Hong Kong residents are free to withdraw Hong Kong dollar deposits without restrictions, and non-residents can also do so after approval; (3) Each person can remit 1,500 yuan in legal tender per month to groups outside the gold pound sterling area, and larger amounts can also be done after approval; (4) Within the gold pound sterling group, other currencies can also be bought and sold.

Gold Market: Since the freezing order was issued, the foreign exchange rate has suddenly tightened, and the price of gold has risen as a result. Because black market cash is not on the frozen list, the number of buyers has increased, and the price of gold has become higher. The change in the price of gold is based on the trade exchange rate of HSBC Bank. If the trade exchange rate of HSBC Bank stops quoting, the existence of the black market gold market may also be shaken.

Prices: Prices in Shanghai were already difficult to control. After the freezing order was issued, the general public was overly worried, believing that since foreign exchange was difficult to obtain, the import of foreign goods would naturally decrease, and prices would inevitably tend to rise in the future. Speculators, seeing that a large amount of idle funds had no way out since foreign exchange was frozen, took the opportunity to stir up trouble and do their best to manipulate and hoard goods, causing prices in Shanghai to rise steadily; this is a temporary phenomenon, and the future trend depends on many factors and is difficult to predict.

### China's Agricultural Loans Chen Hezhang

China's rural areas have long suffered from a shortage of funds, resulting in the widespread phenomenon of usury. According to the Agricultural Information Report of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, indebted farm households account for 62% of the total number of farm households nationwide, farm households borrowing money account for 56%, and farm households borrowing goods account for 48%. As for the sources of farmers' loans, according to the analysis of the Agricultural Information Report, 25% come from merchants, 24.2% from landlords, 18.4% from rich peasants, 13.1% from stores, 8.8% from pawnshops, 5.5% from money houses, 2.6% from cooperatives, and 2.4% from banks. It can be seen that only 5% of the turnover of farmers' funds comes from new-style financial institutions, while 95% is controlled by landlords, gentry, shops, pawnshops, and other usurers. The situation of economic exhaustion in rural areas can be seen from this.

The Need for Agricultural Loans

However, increasing agricultural production, adjusting land utilization and distribution, and improving the marketing of agricultural products all rely on the smooth flow of funds. Since the success of the Northern Expedition in the Republic of China in the 16th year, the government, in view of the urgent need for agricultural finance, established new-style agricultural financial institutions. At this time, China's financial circles also shifted their attention to rural areas, implementing rural loans, and also paying attention to the operation of agricultural warehouses. Although the generally impoverished farmers have not been able to completely relieve all the pain of financial oppression, they have indeed obtained considerable benefits.

Until the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, the national agricultural financial institutions were the Farmers Bank of China and the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau. The agricultural financial institutions at the provincial level were the Farmers Bank of Jiangsu Province, the Cooperative Treasury of Jiangxi Province, the Cooperative Treasury of Sichuan Province, and the local banks of various provinces; the agricultural financial institutions at the county level were the County Farmers Bank of Zhejiang Province, the County Farmers Loan Office, and the county and city cooperative treasuries of various counties and cities. In addition, general public and private banks also engaged in agricultural loan business, such as the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Shanghai Bank, and the Jin Cheng Bank. Later, the Joint Savings Society of the Four Banks added an agricultural finance department to adjust the national agricultural loan business. Therefore, the agricultural loan business showed a vigorous atmosphere.

Recent Developments

Since the outbreak of the war, the government has spared no effort in promoting agricultural loans. The number of agricultural loans has increased year by year. According to the report of the Joint Savings Society of the Four Banks, from July of the 28th year to February of the 29th year, the agricultural loans to various provinces totaled 151,324,481.46 yuan. The distribution is shown in the following table according to region:

From the above table, it can be seen that Sichuan Province accounts for the largest part, with a proportion of 28.08%: followed by Jiangxi, accounting for 7.86%; followed by Jiangsu, accounting for 7.82%. As for Shanxi and Suiyuan, due to the special environment, the proportion is extremely small.

If classified according to the target of agricultural loans, cooperatives account for 47.23% of the total; cooperative treasuries account for 27.21%; and agricultural warehouses account for 5.43%. The situation is shown in the following table:

According to the later report of the Joint Savings Society of the Four Banks, the agricultural loans issued to various provinces in the 29th year totaled 209,502,167 yuan. The following table shows the details: Province Agricultural Loan Amount (Unit: Yuan) Percentage Sichuan 80,744,385 28.54 Xikang 847,000 0.40 Guizhou 14,223,589 6.79 Guangxi 12,178,797 6.00 Ningxia 400,000 0.19 Yunnan 7,874,033 3.76 Hunan 18,306,342 8.74 Jiangxi 2,385,440 5.43 Guangdong 604,444 0.29 Zhejiang 4,873,041 2.35 Henan 4,575,531 2.18 Shaanxi 13,151,783 6.28 Gansu 9,711,000 4.64 Jiangsu 1,981,545 0.94 Anhui 8,439,000 4.03 Hebei 1,414,000 0.68 Suiyuan 57,000 0.03 Shandong 3,136,000 1.54 Hubei 8,068,635 3.85 Fujian 1,192,000 0.57 Shanxi 202,000 0.10 Other 665,602 0.32 Sichuan-Guizhou-Shaanxi-Hunan Border Area 5,000,000 2.39 Total 209,502,167 100.00

From the above table, it can be seen that, except for Shaanxi Province, the circulation of agricultural finance is mostly concentrated in the southwestern provinces. The agricultural loans in Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Hunan provinces reached 133,729,146 yuan, accounting for 63.83% of the total. (To be continued)

Honey Dates Offer New

New honey dates have recently been launched one after another. A small number arrived initially, and the first market sold for 400 yuan. As the source has increased, the market price has dropped by dozens of yuan. The price of Tu Tu is 330 yuan, with each upper and lower grade adding or subtracting 4 yuan. The market is mediocre.

New Branch Dry Back Loose

The first two batches of new lychee dried on mixed roads arrived in small quantities, and the prices were firm. Now the third batch has arrived in slightly larger quantities, and the destocking is relatively quiet, so the market atmosphere has loosened. Yesterday's market price has dropped by ten or twenty yuan, and hundreds of pieces were traded.

Shrimp Tails and Scallops Soar

The price of shrimp tails has been soaring continuously. For example, the price of Longsong Island tails was only 700 yuan in the previous market, but it has recently risen sharply to 1,000 yuan. Yesterday's market opened even higher at 1,180 yuan, a step increase of nearly 500 yuan. Tianbian tails are called 1,200 yuan, Chaobian tails are called 1,500 yuan, and ordinary goods of Yuan Dong tails are called 950 yuan. The arrival of dried scallops is also scarce, and the market price is very tight at 1,500 yuan.

Bitter Almonds Rebound

The destocking of bitter almonds has recently become more active, and dealers are very interested in buying, so the price has risen. For example, the market price of white-skinned bitter almonds is currently 110 yuan, and the price of red-skinned goods is 105 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared with the previous price. The market may continue to rise. It has been found that this product has been sluggish for a long time, and there may be a reversal of fortune in the future, so it is possible to rise by dozens more yards.

The market for white lead wire from No. 8 to No. 20 has not been weak for a long time. Since the day before yesterday, due to the lack of demand from factories in this street, the number of transactions has been increasing day by day. Yesterday's market opened with about 450 dan thrown away, so dealers' minds are firm and rising, and the standard market price has been raised accordingly. It was found that yesterday's market price was 250 yuan per dan for No. 8 to No. 17, and 280 yuan per dan for No. 17 to No. 20, an increase of ten to several yuan compared with the previous price.

### Matches, Soap, and Candles Are Heavily Hoarded

In the midst of the rising prices of all goods, the market situation of daily necessities has also attracted attention from all parties. As the foreign exchange market tightens and the situation in the Far East is getting tighter, the supply of raw materials may be interrupted, leading to a resurgence of hoarding. Market prices are rising every day. Yesterday's market price of Beautiful Brand matches rose to 880 yuan per case, Phoenix Brand to 860 yuan, Gu Ben soap to 57.5 yuan per case, You Xiang soap to 48 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap to 45.5 yuan, and Sailboat Brand candles to 37.5 yuan.

### Vitamins - Fei

The vitamins in food are essential for the body's development, health maintenance, and disease prevention. Here's a breakdown of the functions and sources of various vitamins:

Vitamin A: Helps with development, increases energy, protects the body, and prevents diseases of the nose, throat, and lungs. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children need it even more. Yellow and green foods contain vitamin A. High heat and prolonged exposure to air can reduce the amount of vitamin A.

Sources: Cod liver oil, milk, cheese, liver, egg yolk, kidney. Spinach, lettuce, green beans, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, asparagus, cabbage. Bananas, peaches, oranges, dates, watermelon, etc.

Vitamin B: Can promote development, improve appetite, and strengthen digestion. Because it is soluble in water, the vitamin B content can be lost when food is washed in water.

Sources: Milk, kidney, brain, liver, heart, lean meat, oysters. Grains, beans, sweet potatoes, green onions, cabbage, beet greens. Lemons, oranges, bananas, apples, dates, rice, wheat, oatmeal, almonds, walnuts, peanuts, etc.

Vitamin C: This is essential for maintaining good health. It can resist disease, help heal wounds, and prevent cavities, gum disease, and scurvy.

Sources: Oranges, waxberries, watermelon, lemons, bananas, apples. Cabbage, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, green onions, cucumbers, corn, etc.

Vitamin D: The body needs vitamin D to regulate calcium and phosphorus levels. The body can get vitamin D through exposure to sunlight. Vitamin D also prevents rickets.

Sources: The best source is cod liver oil. In addition, milk, egg yolk, cheese, oysters, and sardines also contain vitamin D.

### How to Wash Silk Clothes - One Yuan

In this hot summer, wearing silk clothes is lighter and more comfortable than wearing cotton clothes. However, because our bodies excrete a lot of sweat, we must wash and change them frequently to maintain hygiene. However, silk clothes are generally thinner than other fabrics, and can be easily damaged if not handled carefully. Here are some simple methods to introduce to readers:

One: No matter what kind of silk clothes you want to wash, you can use willow leaves to boil a liquid, and gently wash them with this liquid. After washing, place them in a shady place to dry, and do not expose them to the sun, which can prevent the original color from fading.

Two: If the silk clothes are white, do not wash them with river water and soap, otherwise the stains will be easily absorbed and difficult to remove. First, rub the stains with tofu, then wash them with clean water, and place them in a shady place to dry, so they can be as white as new.

Three: The best and easiest way to wash white silk clothes is to dissolve soap flakes in warm water, put the clothes in, gently rub them with a soft brush or sponge, and finally add one or two drops of acetic acid (or sulfuric acid). Soak the washed clothes for five or six minutes, which can increase the luster of the silk. It is best to dry them in the shade after washing.

Four: When washing light-colored silk clothes, it is advisable to pour a little lemon into boiling water, and wash them after it has cooled. After washing, place them in a ventilated place to dry until they are half dry, fold the wrinkles, and then dry them completely. Do not expose them to the sun.

Five: If you want to make the fabric firm, then when you wash silk clothes, first put the soap flakes in warm water and soak them slightly, then soak the clothes thoroughly, then take them out and brush them lightly with a soft brush, and finally rinse them two or three times with warm water. You can also put the clothes in warm water dissolved with ammonia, soak them for a while, then take them out and wash them with clean water. This kind of washing method can often give you a firm silk garment.

Six: If you unfortunately get blood on your white silk clothes, don't be alarmed. Quickly take them off, dip a sponge or cloth in water to wash both sides, or place a piece of white cloth on the stain, and put a piece of ice on top of it. Another method is to cut white radish into thin slices and place them on the blood spot, but you need to change them a few times, and the blood stain will be completely absorbed by them, and then wash with cold water, but avoid hot water.

Of course, there are many other methods for washing silk clothes, but if you can memorize the above six methods, it is enough to cope with the difficulties you feel when washing silk clothes!

### Design of Green Gauze Windows - Chang Jun

Many windows and large windows can make the air circulate freely. Originally, it was one of the main conditions of the residence, especially in the hot early autumn. However, if the circulation of air causes mosquitoes and flies to run rampant indoors, and even endanger health, then the loss outweighs the gain.

The best of both worlds is to install screen windows.

In the metropolis, Western-style buildings and noble families originally have no problem with these. Their equipment is complete, the windows are wide and numerous, and iron screens are placed inside and outside. The windows have clear glass. When the windows are opened, the air circulates easily, and mosquitoes and flies cannot fly in.

However, ordinary families do not have such perfect equipment. However, when it comes to hot weather, due to the needs of life, a substitute - silk screen windows - is produced. Although it is not as good as iron screen windows in terms of effectiveness, it is still worth introducing under economic conditions.

It is not difficult to make it yourself, just prepare some green gauze. There are two types of green gauze, coarse and fine. We should use the fine one, because white clams can enter through the gaps in the coarse gauze. If you want to paste coarse gauze, you must paste two layers, which does not seem cost-effective.

The method of pasting is to use coarse hemp rope to tie a paste brush. The paste should be sticky. First, brush a layer of paste around the window frame with the paste brush, and then paste the green gauze, or first use pushpins, and then brush the paste on the window screen. When the window screen is pasted flat, remove the pushpins, and paste a layer of white paper along the edge of the window frame to make it look better.

### Methods to Repel Flies - De Zhi

In the autumn season, flies are still active everywhere, spreading germs. We are here, as if encountering countless invisible bombers, bombing us without restriction. The danger is great, so flies in the hot season are the great enemy of mankind.

Flies spread bacteria. Although there are many kinds of flies, most of those that transmit germs belong to the housefly family. Their long proboscis can be freely stretched and retracted. The front end is wide and has countless fine folds, so it is easy to suck and lick things. The limbs have hairs, and the ends have adhesive discs that secrete a sticky secretion, so they can adhere to objects. Therefore, if flies stop on food or excrement that contains bacteria, they will suck countless bacteria from their proboscis, and stick countless bacteria from their feet. When they fly to another food, they will immediately spread countless bacteria. This is self-evident. Regarding the spread of bacteria by flies, according to the research of Sir Daniel Jacobson and Eisdian, flies were first prevented from adhering to bacteria, and then released into unclean places. After a certain period of time, they were captured and examined, and it was found that each fly adhered to an average of more than 100,000 bacteria. In addition, 40 houseflies flying naturally were examined in detail using various methods, and it was found that the minimum number of bacteria adhered to each fly was 5.5 million, and the maximum number of bacteria adhered to each fly was 6.6 million. In addition, the most common bacteria found were E. coli, which poses a relatively small direct danger to humans. However, this bacterium is closely related to typhoid bacteria, dysentery bacteria, paratyphoid bacteria, cholera bacteria, etc. Therefore, the above-mentioned bacteria can often adhere to flies and spread with them if they have the opportunity. Fly repellent methods: To get rid of these extremely dangerous flies, it is advisable to eliminate them before their eggs, larvae, and pupae turn into flies. Usually, kerosene emulsion, lime-sulfur mixture, pyrethrum, charcoal powder, bleaching powder, and crude cresyl soap are poured into cesspools, garbage cans, and other places where flies breed. Every two weeks, pour in the solution. However, even after pouring in the chemicals, flies will still inevitably occur from time to time. It is best to find a way to block the flies' transportation. This method is guaranteed to be appropriate. Although there are flypaper, glass fly traps, etc., the fly-attracting methods are not good, so the effect is small. The simplest and best method is to mix formaldehyde, milk, and water in a dish and place it in a place where there are many flies. The flies go to lick it and die near it. There are various kinds of poisoning methods for catching flies. Most people use pyrethrum powder or pills, but using this often causes the chemicals to scatter around, and the corpses of flies are scattered everywhere. Those with a mild degree of poisoning can recover immediately. These two points are its shortcomings, so it is better to use a mixture of formaldehyde, milk, and water.

### Vegetarianism - Editor

Vegetarianism and superstition are often mistakenly mixed up in the minds of Chinese people. It is believed that vegetarians must be superstitious, and non-superstitious people do not advocate vegetarianism. This is because the motivation of vegetarians in our country often stems from following Buddhism, even the vegetarian diet in June is called Lei Zhai vegetarian diet. As a result, those who advocate breaking superstitions generally believe that vegetarianism is not worth promoting. This is a big mistake.

Those with a little knowledge of food know that the nutrition of meat is inferior to that of vegetables. Vegetables contain vitamins and continuous substances that meat does not have, while meat often contains toxins, wastes, and parasites that vegetables do not have. Furthermore, in terms of digestion, cleanliness, economy, etc., vegetables are far superior to meat. Therefore, vegetarianism is absolutely hygienic, there is no doubt. Therefore, advanced scholars such as Wen Lan Pavilion and Ding Fubao not only practice vegetarianism, but also establish vegetarian associations to promote it. In addition, there are world vegetarian banquets held, and the participants are all contemporary outstanding talents. It can be seen that religious belief is up to each individual, while the practice of vegetarianism is an essential way to health.

To help intellectuals in China gradually understand the value of vegetarianism and the need to promote it, we plan to adopt various vegetarian cooking methods for reference. Zhu Zi said that garden vegetables are more delicious than delicacies. If they can be cooked properly, the pleasure of eating them will not be inferior to bear paws or camel humps. Everyone... if you want to buy "MSG", "Tianchu soy sauce extract", as well as oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, please call "44594", and a special delivery will be arranged immediately without taking delivery charges.

One Week of Home-style Recipes - Yu - Corn, also known as corn, commonly known as pearl rice, is something that everyone loves to eat. It contains abundant vitamins, and eating it often is very beneficial to the body. Although it can be eaten as a snack, it can also be peeled off grain by grain and used as a dish. The aroma can be very appetizing. Recently, my family has often used it to make soup. For meat dishes, it can be stewed with beef, cabbage, and potatoes. Sometimes it is cooked with chicken giblets and ham slices, which is very delicious. For vegetarian dishes, it can be stewed with shepherd's purse and edamame, which also feels light and delicious. This way of eating is more meaningful than eating the whole corn. Readers may wish to try it.

### Food Trivia

In 1837, the regulations of Hall Institute University in the United States stipulated that women entering the school must know how to make a fire and how to wash sweet potatoes. A dog weighing 40 pounds can hold the food of three people weighing 150 pounds in its stomach, so the food that dogs eat is often more than their owners.

Currently, one-third of the world's humans use knives and forks, one-third use chopsticks, and the remaining one-third still use their fingers.

At a recent welcome meeting held in Arabia, the most valuable dish was roasted camel, with three sheep as accessories, as well as eggs and dried fruits, eaten with white rice.

In the United States a hundred years ago, beef, pork, salted fish, and sweet potatoes were preserved and eaten all year round.

Seventy percent of all fish in the UK are sold in hot fish shops. There are 30,000 of these shops. (Hundred)

Who says "people's food is difficult"? There are many people who dislike the fact that a banquet costing two hundred yuan is not grand enough! (Fanxing)

### A Proposal - Promoting the Tutor Movement - Ge Chun - Home Education Supplements School Deficiencies, After-school Tutoring Can Open Up a New Path

After reading "Two College Students Applying for Scholarships", I have a small proposal for society. I think that for scholarships for college students, the higher the level of study, the more it seems like unearned income on the one hand, and on the other hand, it seems to slightly reduce their self-esteem. For this reason, I think it is better to let them work part-time while studying. And there are many people who do not want to rely on their father's hard work to study, but do not want to deprive others of scholarships. Of course, they are extremely eager to have a part-time job opportunity.

As for where to find evening work?

Here, I hope that public houses with children can hire a college student to tutor their children in the evening or on Saturdays and Sundays. The salary is paid every six months, which can not only or support their studies, but also cultivate their spirit of independence and hard work.

Based on my experience as a part-time tutor for the past year, I deeply feel the inadequacy of school education. I am not saying that school education should be abolished, I mean that in addition to sending children to school, they also need tutoring.

One of the children I taught. Looking at his math exercise book in school, almost all of them are 100 points. Perhaps out of curiosity, I asked him to redo some of the arithmetic questions he had done. As a result, he stared blankly at the white paper for half an hour. After my repeated inquiries, I learned that he had copied from the person next to him for every question. This situation is not uncommon in schools. But if a child enters school and starts copying from elementary school all the way to sixth grade. Ha, graduated! Think about what he has gained? This phenomenon is the same not only in elementary schools, but also in middle schools and universities. Everyone who has been through it probably knows it!

If you have younger siblings or children studying in school, you may wish to take their books and ask them about them in your spare time. The result will be very disappointing. If you ask them sternly why they don't listen in school. One said: "The two people in front are talking all day long, and I can't hear what the teacher is teaching."

One said: "The teacher in school teaches too fast. I went to pick up a piece of paper, and by the time I came back, a large section had already been skipped."

In the innocent hearts of children, this may be the truth. However, can this be blamed on the teachers? With forty or fifty people in the whole class, it would be too much trouble to take care of everyone. Therefore, it is indeed necessary to review them at home. But the father comes back very tired in the evening, how can he teach them? The mother is worried about housework, how can she have this free time, so it is better to let college students or high school students take on this task in their spare time!

You may think that if they are taught in school and then taught at home, isn't that redundant? Yes, if the child is very, very smart, but an average child can only grasp half of what is taught in one or two lessons, and that is probably when he is listening attentively. To make him reach a state of sudden enlightenment, it will take five or six lessons. And two people teaching a book can allow students to gain the best of both. For example, when I was reading Kuai Rou Yu Sheng before, there were two teachers, one was Mr. Xie, whom I admired, and the other was the principal, an English gentleman. Mr. Xie explained to us in detail, while the principal had a pure English accent. He also often told us about English customs and habits. I felt that Mr. Xie taught us what the principal could not teach, but the principal taught us what Mr. Xie could not think of. Therefore, having two people teach is far better than any one person.

### Odds and Ends - Peng Fei

Son: "Dad, didn't you say before that this is what the lower class eats? Why are you eating it now?"

Father: "Because the lower class can't afford it now!"

Grandma: "I've lived for eighty years, I never dreamed that a dan of rice would cost more than a hundred yuan!"

Daughter-in-law: "Then, is the old saying "rice like pearls, firewood like cassia" only true now?"

Grandma: "…… I forgot that you are the daughter of a rice merchant."

### Eleven - Midnight Song

She vaguely heard a dog barking wildly in the street.

"Maybe Uncle Zhao is back." She thought this guess was mostly right.

But later she didn't hear the sound of opening and closing the door.

"Wouldn't it be better if Mom could come back today?" She continued to think vaguely. "If I told Mom about learning opera, she definitely wouldn't be angry, maybe she would laugh happily!"

But could her mother, whom she hadn't seen for nine years, still be as young and beautiful as in the photo? Would she already be as old as her father and completely different from before? This was something Mei Bao couldn't imagine at all. She yawned on the pillow, and gradually felt tired. Three or four minutes after she closed her eyes, she seemed to feel that she had returned to the girls' dormitory of Hengshui County Middle School.

"Miss Wu, there is a lady outside looking for you." Just as she was reviewing her lessons, an old nanny ran in excitedly and said to her.

"Where?" She stood up immediately.

"Waiting in the reception room!"

After just one turn, she walked to the entrance of the reception room. At the end of the long rectangular table, which was covered with a white cloth all year round, sat a graceful and elegant young woman, who hugged her eagerly as soon as she saw her.

"Mei Bao, why didn't you come to see me once in nine years?" Mom asked with red eyes.

She seemed to know where her mother lived, and felt very embarrassed when asked this way. (187)

### The "Vase" Job Application - Yin Zi

On the thirteenth of last month, I actually received a notification letter in great anticipation. After I opened it and read it, really, I was extremely happy at that time. I secretly thought that my unemployment for the past six months had been saved. It turned out that a certain company was recruiting a female accountant, and I was luckily selected. But when I recalled the day of the interview, how apprehensive I was!

The letter notified me to start working at the company on the fifteenth.

On the day I entered the company, I was introduced to Manager Wang by Mr. Xia, the deputy manager from the previous interview. He was a tall, thin, and funny man in his early thirties. He immediately expressed great admiration for my being selected from among more than fifty female applicants; and praised my English, Japanese, and Chinese and foreign accounting skills.

"Miss Yu, we are really lucky to have an accountant with such talent as you! Well... this will indeed have a great development in business, don't you think?"

From then on, he kept calling me "Miss Honey" this and "Miss Honey" that. Two or three days later, when the company was just closing in the evening, he came over and asked me if I wanted to go to Da Guangming to see a movie. At that time, I declined with an excuse. The next day, I don't know why, he suddenly bought perfume, rouge, nail polish, etc. to prepare to give to me. I was very surprised: what does he mean by this! I said: "Mr. Wang, thank you for your kindness, I don't use these. Please take them back and give them to your wife to use!"

"Haha" he laughed. "Miss Yu, you don't know that I don't have a woman yet..."

But in the end, I didn't accept his "gift". However, I later wanted to influence this manager in terms of work and personality, and wanted to improve his personality so that he wouldn't be so bored. But, before a few days had passed, he actually asked me to go to the ×× dance hall to dance; but I sternly refused him: we must not talk about love under such circumstances. I also said: "Since you love me, can't we start loving each other in our careers first?" In fact, this was what I had to say to get rid of him in a difficult situation.

Suddenly, on the thirty-first day, Deputy Manager Xia said to me: "Miss Yu, we feel very sorry, but yesterday you made a mistake in an account, which is obviously your negligence. Therefore, Mr. Wang's meaning is... oh... actually the manager said you are too cold and don't know how to socialize... Here is your half-month's salary, fifteen yuan... you don't have to come tomorrow." (Payment)

### Are They Going to Hold a Religious Ritual Again? - Zhu Juran

The autumn brought by the hurricane has arrived in the world. The people on the isolated island are mostly prescient; they are going to decorate the autumn, and there will be gongs and drums in the alley, which is the autumn ritual on the isolated island.

Everyone knows that holding a ritual is a kind of superstitious act. However, every year every alley always has this kind of ceremony, but the scale is slightly different. Some of the reasons for holding it may be to raise money, and some are caused by special elements in the alley taking advantage of the situation. As for whether the ritual is helpful for eliminating epidemics, we knowledgeable people seem to have been arguing about it for too long.

Just the manpower, materials, and financial resources consumed by holding a ritual are very alarming. If it really has the effect of human affairs, then these consumed money and manpower are still a little worthwhile. Look: isn't it true that many people on the isolated island still die from epidemics every year? Aren't the epidemic hospitals crowded? Human affairs have not yet been exhausted, why bother with ghosts?

Friends on the isolated island! Don't you still feel the high cost of living? Why do you still want to waste so much money? Why don't you use this money to do some "human affairs"?
