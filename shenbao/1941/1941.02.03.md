### If the Lend-Lease Act Passes, the U.S. Will Take Over Pacific Routes; Simultaneously Researching Extensive Economic Warfare Plan to Counter the Axis Powers' Attack on Britain and Threat to the Far East

Washington: House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom stated yesterday after meeting with British Ambassador Halifax that he had declared to the British Ambassador that the Lend-Lease Act would definitely pass the House without much change. (Reuters, 2nd)

Washington: According to Senator Nye, he knows that once the Lend-Lease Act is passed, the first step for the United States will be to take over British shipping routes in the Pacific, so that Britain can focus on routes in the Atlantic. He also stated that he believes this action does not violate neutrality. (Associated Press, 2nd)

Washington: President Roosevelt and his advisors are currently studying an extensive and costly economic warfare plan to counter the Axis powers' attack on Britain in mid-1942. This plan includes several countries on four continents. Observers in Washington believe that if President Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Act passes smoothly, the plan will soon be submitted to Congress. The United States will invest huge funds and interests in this plan to break the Axis powers' war machine by blockading Germany's supply of oil, copper, cotton, and minerals. (Associated Press, 2nd)

Washington: Secretary of the Navy Knox told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that he was very concerned whether U.S. aid could reach Britain in time. When Knox was urging the Senate to quickly pass the Lend-Lease Act, isolationist leader Nye asked, "If the crisis that is expected to come soon materializes, can we save Britain in time?" Knox replied, "I honestly don't know. I am extremely anxious." Nye continued to speak about the naval power that the Axis powers could have after winning and asked, "Are you sure there is danger?" Knox replied, "I am sure there is danger. Do you think that after the Axis powers win, they can ignore us?" Nye said, "I believe the Axis powers will not ignore us, because they will be forced to deal with domestic suffering, famine, and minorities ready to revolt." Knox said, "Have you ever heard of a victorious country retreating when there is still something to gain?" Nye asked, "Do you think there is a danger of the enemy attacking the United States through Canada?" Knox replied, "The danger always exists. The base in Newfoundland puts the border of Detroit, USA, within its range." Nye then asked if the British Navy and British islands are the most powerful defense line for the United States. Knox replied, "Yes." Nye continued to ask, "But you think that even if we try our best to build our defenses, we may not be able to make them stronger?" Knox said, "I don't hold that view. This is why I support this Lend-Lease Act. Even if we can't recover a dollar, I should help it. I think spending money like this is saving money." (Reuters, 2nd)

Washington: Secretary of the Navy Knox told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that if the United States is forced to face the Axis powers alone, then "the United States may be outnumbered." He also stated that once Britain fails, Germany will have 700 times the convenience of the United States in terms of shipbuilding. However, he is not afraid of Germany immediately invading the U.S. coast, as Germany may first seek to establish a base in South America, as he said on Friday. Senator Nye, a Republican isolationist from North Dakota, asked, "If the Axis powers attack the Western Hemisphere, Japan is restricted by the war in China and cannot be of significant service." Knox replied, "Japan's navy is no small loss to the United States." Knox said that Japan controls the seas surrounding China, but he would not predict what kind of work Japan would undertake because "the current world situation" is extremely complicated. Nye asked, "Do you think there is a danger of the Axis powers jointly attacking us?" Knox said, "I can affirm it. Why do you think that they, having such power, can let us go?" Senator Connally, a Democrat from Texas, asked, "After Britain fails, will the Axis powers and Japan threaten us?" Knox said, "Japan is also part of the Axis powers." Senator Barkley, a Democrat from Kentucky, asked, "After the Axis powers achieve victory in Europe, will they increase the chances of victory in Asia?" Knox replied, "I think so." Barkley also asked if Germany and Italy will help Japan in the war against China. Knox said, "They have already said so." (Associated Press, 2nd)

Washington: Representative Pepper, a Democrat from Florida, suggested to the U.S. Congress yesterday that Congress should listen to President Roosevelt's "wartime plenary powers issue to deal with the terrible crisis we are currently facing." He said, "Congress does not truly understand the severity of the crisis." He proposed that Congress should authorize the President to launch general national defense matters and abolish all restrictions that hinder national defense equipment and national debt.

### Kimmel Takes Office as Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Navy, Watching the Dangerous Situation and Completing His Mission with Absolute Readiness

Honolulu: General Kimmel officially succeeded General Richardson yesterday as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy. General Richardson said at the time of his retirement, "The future is not a smooth road, and there is much to be done." However, he said that the U.S. sailors and fleet can be used and can complete the mission under any dangerous situation. Kimmel replied, "I really don't need to say much. The people of the country should know that the days to come will be busy days. We will continue to focus our attention so that we can complete any task with absolute readiness." At that time, seventeen generals boarded the flagship "Pennsylvania" in the sound of bugles. The Navy Band played "The Navy Admiral's March" for each general. The Navy also fired cannons to salute. The generals were wearing white uniforms and not full dress uniforms. (Associated Press, 2nd)

Washington: The U.S. Navy Department released 126 tons of stored tungsten yesterday for loan to the steel industry to solve the industry's temporary shortage and increase the production of high-quality steel. The Navy Department stated that the shortage of tungsten ore was affected by the three-month closure of the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Although the road has now been opened, there are still no new goods arriving. However, the tungsten lent out this time can only be used by the steel and copper industries for one week.

### Japanese Newspaper Makes Outrageous Remarks, Warning the United States That the U.S. Lacks Raw Materials and Is Not Conducive to War with Japan

Tokyo: Mutō, a commentator for the Hōchi Shimbun, recently published an article in the newspaper advising the United States to be careful not to offend Japan. The article stated that hundreds of American people are freezing to death on the streets, and the United States lacks major raw materials. In the war in the Pacific, the United States will collapse. Mutō said, "In New York in midwinter, the weather is severe, and often about 500 people freeze to death in one day. The only thing they can rely on to keep warm is wool. If the source of wool in Australia is cut off, then the Americans can only die. Tungsten and other important industrial raw materials that the United States relies on from foreign countries are even more unnecessary to mention. The United States should understand that the world war that the country wants to provoke is no different from its own death penalty." Mutō said that the current attitude of the U.S. government towards Japan is to cause the United States and Japan to fight. He said, "If a war breaks out between the United States and Japan, the United States will rely only on the Panama Canal Railway and motorways. The United States must mobilize all its strength to concentrate on manufacturing heavy vehicles. The rubber needed for this manufacturing is all imported from Southeast Asia. How to maintain maritime transport is a problem. The United States cannot do it." Mutō also said that regarding the waters of the Far East, how the United States wants to avoid the crisis of collapse is possible. He said, "We want to tell the United States that Japan has no intention of dominating the western Pacific. What Japan seeks is only the natural resources necessary to maintain its national destiny. Japan does not deny the United States the freedom to obtain what it needs, because Japan also needs these raw materials. Narrow-mindedness and arbitrariness are only possessed by Americans. If the United States is generous and willing to reconsider its attitude, willing to cooperate with Japan, and agree to determine the scope of obtaining natural resources in the Western Pacific, then the tragedy of the Pacific, which is unfortunate for all mankind, can be avoided. An urgent crisis is waiting for us. What is hanging over Japan and the United States is a sharp sword hanging by a thin thread. This is our loyal advice to the United States."

### Soviet Union Opens New Far East Route

Moscow: The Soviet Union will open new airlines in the Far East. Regarding this matter, Molokov, Director of the Soviet Civil Aviation Administration, told reporters, "In recent years, civil aviation in the Far East has greatly developed. Several lines have connected the coastal areas of Khabarovsk and remote areas. At present, the Khabarovsk-Okha (on Sakhalin Island), Khabarovsk-Nikolaevsk, and Khabarovsk-Alexandrovsk lines have smooth and uninterrupted civil aviation. At the same time, the new Khabarovsk-Petropavlovsk line (2,200 kilometers long) has also recently begun transporting goods and passengers. Last year, Soviet civil aviation personnel completed 1,342,010 kilometers of flights in the Far East. This year, the Khabarovsk-Osipenko line will be added." (TASS, 2nd)

### Japan Exhausts Resources and Intensifies Control

Tokyo: After tomorrow's cabinet meeting approves, the Minister of Finance will submit a revised Foreign Exchange Control Law bill to the Diet. Its main purpose is to rectify the current control on the basis of war, because the current control has been repeatedly revised, although it is suitable for peacetime, but since the European war and especially after the establishment of the Tripartite Pact, the international situation has undergone drastic changes, so it is still not completely applicable. (Reuters, 2nd)

### U.S.-Soviet Trade Relations Remain Unchanged; Hull Opposes Reducing Exports

Washington: The U.S. government tried its best to reduce shipments to the Soviet Union in the middle of this month, because the United States believed that exports to the Soviet Union were undermining the British blockade measures. British officials all said that even if U.S. goods stopped being shipped to Germany, there would still be Soviet goods shipped to Germany. Senior officials here said that conservative Americans generally do not agree with President Roosevelt's change in Soviet policy, so they all hope that President Roosevelt will take this measure, but Secretary of State Hull and his surrounding diplomats believe that stopping exports to the Soviet Union will deal a fatal blow to the establishment of friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.

### U.S. National Guard Joins Regular Army; 5,000 Philippine Reservists Also Join U.S. Army for Training

U.S. military authorities said that the 5,000 people should be carefully selected in order to select excellent members. This new army will increase the current strength of the U.S. troops stationed in the Philippines, with approximately 5,000 U.S. regular army soldiers and 5,000 Philippine team soldiers.

Editorial

### The Henan Campaign

The Sino-Japanese war has long been in a state of stalemate and stagnation, but in the past ten days, with the approach of spring, it has suddenly become active. Since late January, fierce battles have broken out everywhere in the entire Henan-Hubei war zone. According to a Havas report from Chongqing on the 30th, a spokesman for the Chinese Military Affairs Commission stated that this battle was one of the important battles, and the situation would depend on the development within this week. This is of course only a local battle, and Chongqing denied that it was a prelude to the Japanese army's spring offensive; however, at this moment when news of the Allied countries' joint offensive and the Chinese army launching a major counterattack are frequently reported, it is necessary to pay close attention to it.

This campaign began on January 24 near Kaifeng and Xinyang in southern Henan. Before that, the Japanese army had launched offensives in Jingmen, Yangzi, and Dangyang Zhongxiang in central Hubei. They invaded both sides of the Xiang River and the western foothills of the Dahong Mountains. On the morning of the 24th, the Japanese army used two divisions of troops to attack north from the three strongholds of Changtaiguan, Chushandian, and Youhe in northern Xinyang, and concentrated its main force along the Pinghan Railway. At the same time, they also advanced from the west of Xinyang in three routes to invade the foothills of the Tongbai Mountains. In Kaifeng in eastern Henan and Boxian in western Anhui, they harassed the east side of the Pinghan Railway. From the perspective of the Japanese military deployment, it can be confirmed that this campaign has a fairly important nature and is not comparable to the years of Japanese-used mobile warfare tactics or so-called "mopping-up battles." In terms of strategy, the Japanese army along the Pinghan Railway is naturally the main force, and its purpose is undoubtedly to open up the Pinghan Railway line; and the activities of the Japanese army in central Hubei, eastern Henan, and even the border between Henan and Hubei are all used to contain the Chinese army's reinforcement or mobilization. As of the time of writing, except for the Japanese army in central Hubei who were driven out earlier, on the Henan-Hubei border, after several days of fierce fighting, the Japanese army in the triangular area of Xinyang, Queshan, and Tongbai is also being surrounded by the Chinese army. Only the main force along the railway line, after fleeing to Zhumadian, divided into two routes to peep into Xiping and Wuyang on the left, and Runan and Shangcai on the right. On the front, the two armies are confronting each other on both sides of the Ru River. In recent days, the Henan army has gathered in western Henan and deployed closely. It is difficult for the Japanese army to avoid repeating the mistakes of the previous Hubei-Hunan campaign.

The central Henan Plain, the main battlefield of this campaign, occupies a crucial position in the north, south, east, and west, and has historically been contested by military strategists in China. Since the end of the Xuzhou campaign in the spring of 1938, which ended the second phase of the first period of the Sino-Japanese war, the Japanese army's original intention was to capture Wuhan along the Pinghan Railway from northern and eastern Henan, but because of the Yellow River breach, which flowed from northeast of Zhengzhou directly to the Huai River Basin, forming an insurmountable natural moat, the Japanese army had to detour along the Yangtze River and the border between Anhui and Hubei to advance towards Wuhan, paying twice the price. After Wuhan and Guangzhou were successively abandoned, the Japanese strategy hesitated, lost its center of gravity, and always hovered between continuing to invade inland and ensuring the occupied areas; and the attempt to open up the trunk line from Beijing directly to Guangzhou, after several failed attempts, was temporarily shelved. This area of the central Henan Plain has not been fought for nearly two years. Now, after many deployments, the Japanese army suddenly adopted an offensive. Although this happens to be the Japanese political season, it should not be regarded merely as boasting about "war achievements" to the Diet in order to pass the military budget and the General Mobilization Law amendment. Its more important intention is to open up this trunk line running through the Central Plains, occupy an area that controls the key points of east, west, north, and south, in order to "freeze" the military in China, "build" the occupied areas, and indirectly also be a necessary preparation for transferring strength and engaging in southward advance. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has repeatedly revealed a breath of peace in the Diet recently. This is a political anesthesia for the Diet, that is, for the general Japanese people, and a smoke screen, and it is not enough to be regarded as a peaceful offensive against China; because with its clarity, it knows at least that during Japan's continued aggression in its various forms, it will definitely not get peace. Japan does want to pull two muddy feet out of the Chinese battlefield, but to pull out one, it must also rely on the remaining strength to make a final attempt; and the recent large-scale offensive in southern Henan is a manifestation of this attempt.

The southern Henan campaign is still in progress and has not come to an end. Regardless of how the results advance or retreat, they are only partial advances or retreats; China will reap more or less of the results of the war of attrition, but Japan will not fulfill its desire to pull out two or one muddy feet. Of course, China this year will not be satisfied with merely causing the other side to wear out; what is a pity is that the lack of heavy military equipment hinders the implementation of a full-scale counteroffensive. Even in this southern Henan campaign, the Japanese army on all lines failed to succeed. Only the main force along the railway line was able to make some progress. The Chinese army also had to use flexible mobile warfare tactics to deal with it. Undoubtedly, this is due to the disparity in the equipment of the two sides. Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper strongly argued that the United States' aid to China and Britain must be carried out quickly and seize the opportunity. It is hoped that the United States Congress can learn a profound lesson from the ongoing Sino-Japanese campaign.

### Fierce Battles Near Su County for Several Days; Chinese Army Captures Strongholds; Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Casualties in Chinese Encirclement and Annihilation; More Than a Thousand Japanese Troops Invaded Westward in Wen County Without Success

### Mediation of War – Prelude to Southern Advance

Saigon – A certain neutral diplomat told the Associated Press reporter tonight that Japan is planning to consolidate its position in southern Vietnam in order to use the area as a "springboard" for taking action against the Dutch East Indies or Singapore. The neutral observer also stated that although Japan's plans are already obvious, he cannot say whether their primary purpose is to deal with the Dutch East Indies or Singapore. (Saigon's newspaper censors deleted the details of this plan.) It is believed that the Japanese must have indicated their intentions to Tokyo or the Vichy French authorities. The full content of the Japanese plan may be revealed during the Tokyo peace talks between Thailand and Vietnam. Furthermore, it was officially announced tonight that the head of the Vietnamese government cabinet, Gao Diyi'er, may be appointed as the chief representative of a five-member delegation to participate in the upcoming Tokyo peace talks.

Rome – The "Rome Popolo" newspaper published a commentary yesterday criticizing the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire agreement, stating that Japan's mediation this time is a prelude to armed intervention in the Singapore area. The Fascist mouthpiece stated that Japan's mediation is fully in line with the provisions of the Tripartite Pact. It also stated that Japan's rule of "Greater East Asia" has been publicly recognized. The newspaper said, "The result of Japan's mediation of the conflict has made the Japanese Empire's hegemony in Greater Asia recognized by the world. This is purely as stipulated by the Tripartite Pact. Japan's mediation and interference are not only the realization of the overall sphere of influence of the Axis powers, but in reality, it is the precursor to Japan's armed intervention in the Singapore area, or even the encirclement of that naval base." (2nd Associated Press)

Vichy – Colonial Minister, Rear Admiral Pelaudong, recently issued a public statement stating, "The Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire agreement has been signed and established in Saigon. Detailed regulations have been added regarding the cessation of military actions by both sides, especially the simultaneous withdrawal of troops.

Not only that, but in order to achieve a practical resolution of past disputes, both sides shall continue talks within a short period of time." (1st Havas)

### Japan to Further Reduce Gasoline Consumption Quotas – Private Cars May Become Useless

Hong Kong – Tokyo News: The Japanese Jiji Shimpo recently reported that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department intends to further reduce the gasoline consumption quota for Tokyo in February. It is estimated that private cars can only use six gallons of gasoline per month. The monthly quota for trucks is divided into several types: normal is 31 gallons, medium is 24 gallons, small is 17 gallons, and the smallest is 5 gallons. Taxis owned by private individuals are 24 gallons, and those that pick up passengers on the street are 40 gallons. In addition, the monthly quota for trucks used for public transportation is also divided into four types: normal is 66 gallons, medium is 60 gallons, small is 37 gallons, and the smallest is 15 gallons. It is generally expected that the quota for March will be further reduced, generally one-third of the average monthly consumption in 1940. According to the newly set quota, it is practically impossible for private individuals to use cars. The Tokyo Taxi Streetcar Owners Association will have to reduce the number of vehicles in operation and increase fares, or it may have to change the car's engine to use other fuels such as charcoal or gas.

### Rumors that Germany is Building a Secret Military Zone on the Northern Coast of France – Invasion of England is Imminent – But Denies Preparing to Use Poison Gas

London – England is now preparing for the German side to carry out unprecedented and terrifying bombings at any time, but last night the London area and various parts of England were shrouded in dense fog, so the German side's activities in the English sky have been reduced to a minimum. According to informed sources, the recent fierce bombardment by Nazi artillery on the French coast shows that the invasion of England is only a matter of a week or a few days. It is generally believed that the three-hour German artillery bombardment of the Dover area is the initial step in the invasion of England. British officials also agree that the German invasion of England seems imminent, but they say that only time can prove whether the attack on England will happen immediately, or will be prevented by Hitler's generals. News from Vichy says that military observers say that the German side has been waiting for a long time to attack England, but now it is imminent. People here are paying close attention to this news. French military experts say that the invasion of England will be launched in early February. It is alleged that the Germans have established a secret zone on the northern coast of France, so news about German military actions in that area cannot be obtained. The British official's commentary on the rumored invasion plan can be seen in the remarks of a certain government official, who said, "Let them come, we have been waiting for a long time."

### American Military Experts Predict that Romania Will Become a Battlefield – Bulgaria Intensifies Air Defense – Ministry of National Defense Orders People to Serve

New York – Romania is Hitler's main source of oil, so it may immediately be drawn into the vortex of war. Some military experts predict that Romania may also become a battlefield. It is said that Romanian oil is a necessity for Germany, so Hitler's actions in the eastern Balkans are quite cautious. Although the Germans now tightly control Romania, they are still hesitant and dare not pass through Bulgaria to attack Greece. If Germany invades Romania, Britain will attack the Romanian oil fields. The loss of Romanian oil is a major blow to Hitler. If Britain has sufficient aircraft, it is easy to attack Romania from its bases in Greece. Romanian oil is not an indispensable item for Britain. The situation in Romania is favorable to Britain in this regard, and Hitler has not yet acted because he does not want to endanger this source of oil. However, observers say that Romania will eventually become a battlefield, and it may happen immediately. (2nd International News Agency)

### British Newspapers Highlight the Crisis in France – Saying that Germany Will Occupy the Entire Territory of France

London – The Sunday newspapers here all published articles detailing the crisis in Vichy.

The newspaper's New York correspondent said that people in Stockholm all believe that the fierce attacks on Vichy by the Paris newspapers are a preparatory stage for the German occupation. The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent believes that the final result of the correspondence between Hitler and Pétain may be announced in the next few days or even hours. The wording of the Paris newspapers under German control yesterday was tantamount to a German ultimatum. The newspaper's editorial also pointed out that Hitler's true desire is to obtain the remnants of the French navy and the naval bases of Toulon and Brest. (2nd Reuters)

### New French Party Appears in Paris – Advocating French-German Cooperation

### The Situation in Romania Remains Unclear – Authorities are on High Alert – Those Carrying Firearms Will be Killed Without Mercy

Bucharest – Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu recently issued an order that anyone found carrying firearms privately will be executed immediately, and ordered the army to deal with the rebellion with extreme severity. If anyone gathers a crowd without authorization and does not immediately submit to investigation, they can be shot. According to previous orders from the Romanian Prime Minister, those arrested carrying weapons were not to be executed immediately, but it is heard that this leniency was misunderstood, so the Romanian Prime Minister has now issued this new order. (2nd Reuters)

Bucharest – Although Romania is extremely peaceful in all parts of the country, the domestic situation remains unclear. The instigators of the recent popular uprising have not been captured. The famous members of the Fascist Iron Guard, who are responsible for this riot, are still at large and can be seen in the capital almost every day without any inconvenience. One example is the recently dismissed President of the University of Bucharest, Panaitescu, who is still a professor in the Faculty of Arts of the university. It is generally believed that the former cabinet associate, namely the leader of the Iron Guard, Sima, and his accompanying military officers, Lieutenant Iafen Fei and Lieutenant Braunneko, are still hiding somewhere in the city. For this reason, the Ministry of the Army issued a public statement today to strengthen security, briefly stating, "From today onwards, if the people riot again, the national army may immediately shoot those who refuse to obey orders. Anyone who possesses or carries firearms without government permission will also be killed without mercy." In addition, General Antonescu, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, has instructed the national army to take strict measures to suppress any violence. Several rebels who have been arrested have mostly been executed on the spot. As for the international environment of Romania, Germany seems to still support General Antonescu because it urgently wants Romania to restore peace. However, the Iron Guard has close ideological ties with German National Socialism, so Prime Minister Antonescu sometimes has no choice but to deal with the members of the Iron Guard who participated in the turmoil lightly.

### General Weygand Gives a Broadcast Speech – Calling on the People of North Africa to Cooperate and Work Together for Revival

London – General Weygand, the French representative in North Africa, broadcast on Algiers Radio last night, calling on the people of French North Africa to cooperate loyally under the leadership of General Pétain to engage in the work of reviving the country.

After Weygand's speech, his speech was translated into Arabic and broadcast. In his speech, Weygand advised listeners to trust their leaders, saying that the leaders knew the suffering of the people and were responsible for the future of the country, so they should eliminate the suffering. The speech mentioned the North African Economic Conference recently held in Algiers, saying that significant results have been achieved and all organizations that have been disrupted by recent events must be reorganized. This work is extremely arduous, and Paris cannot be built in a day. Weygand also elaborated on the great significance of the social actions in the national revolution launched by General Pétain in French Africa and the need for youth and labor organizations, and detailed issues such as the resettlement of refugees and housing, medical care, and social assistance.

### Eritrean Region: Italian Forces' Communications Cut Off; British Forces Continue Advance Along Mediterranean Coast; German Aircraft Attack British Base in North Africa

Cairo: British mechanized units have now cut off the 15-mile long road between Agordat and Barentu, two important towns in the Eritrean region. Therefore, the communication of the Italian forces guarding the aforementioned two towns has been interrupted. It is estimated that each of these two towns has one Italian division. Fierce battles are currently taking place around the two towns. The Italian forces are relying on already constructed military positions to put up an even stronger resistance. British mechanized units are advancing in the rugged terrain of the Eritrean highlands. At the same time, after the rapid advance of British forces by 100 miles, the work of dispatching reinforcements and supplies by the British is continuing. According to a report from Kenya, patrols along the entire Kenyan border are still very active, and fighting is developing in the area of Seymor Yial. (Reuters, 2nd)

British Forces' Position: The British forces' advance along the Mediterranean coast continued yesterday. Italian forces 50 miles from the coast are retreating towards the Libyan coast. Since the British offensive, approximately 500 Italian aircraft have been destroyed on the ground. Italian forces are using armored vehicles to form fortifications, surrounded by large rocks, to put up a stubborn resistance before the British mechanized units can encircle them. At the same time, a unit of French-Saharan camel soldiers launched a surprise attack on enemy forces at the Libyan front, creating a new line of defense. Italian forces are still firmly holding Jebel Abiad, south of Bardia, but have been cut off from other friendly forces. (Associated Press, 2nd)

### Italian 10,000-Ton Naval Transport Sunk by Greek Submarine; Greek Forces Continue Advances in Albania, Capturing High Peak and Controlling Entire Area

Athens: An official announcement states that the Greek submarine "Papanikolis" sank another 10,000-ton Italian ship with a torpedo outside the Bering Desi on January 28th. Since Christmas, this submarine has sunk three Italian troop transports, and this is the fourth. (Reuters, 2nd)

Budapest: Greek radio reported that a Greek submarine recently sank a 10,000-ton Italian giant transport ship in the Adriatic Sea. The ship was a member of a convoy sailing from Brindisi, a major port in southern Italy, to Vlorë. It was also reported that Greek forces occupied a 1,500-meter high mountain north of Himara (on the southern coast of Albania), which controls the north of Himara. British aircraft heavily bombed Tepelene, causing great chaos among the Italian forces there. A fierce counterattack by Italian forces in the central battlefield was crushed by Greek artillery fire. The Athens Ministry of War announced that there were local battles in various places, and Greek forces occupied several key points, capturing many automatic rifles and old cannons, and capturing 270 Italian soldiers. The Ministry of Public Security announced that the internal situation in Greece was very calm. From December 29th to January 29th, Italian aircraft attacked Greece, killing 29 men, 21 women, and 17 children, and wounding 40 men, 35 women, and 15 children. (Associated Press, 2nd)

London: According to a radio message from Athens, the important high peak, known as "1960," which was fortified by the government of Albanian King Zog, was captured by Greek forces after a night of fierce fighting. The Italian forces initially resisted strongly but were ultimately no match for the fierce Greek assault and retreated. A large amount of military supplies could not be carried away. Yesterday, Greek forces also achieved victory on the coastal front. The Italian forces launched a very strong counterattack, and the two sides engaged in extremely fierce fighting, the first major battle since General Cavallero took office as Italian commander. However, the Italian forces ultimately retreated in disarray due to excessive casualties, unable to regroup. Greek forces pursued, seizing a 5,000-foot high peak that controlled the entire area. Another high peak to the northeast was also captured. The Italian forces suffered considerable losses. As a result, all Italian counterattacks were defeated. Greek forces are now advancing steadily towards the objectives designated by their commander. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Vatican to Convene Council of Bishops

Clermont-Ferrand: According to Paris Soir, once the war is over, the Vatican will convene a council of 2,000 bishops from around the world. Of the 25 cardinals, 19 have expressed their support for this. The main agenda items to be discussed at the council are: (1) the relationship between the Vatican and the emerging countries after the war; (2) the education of young Catholic believers; (3) the restoration of the family and the Christian social order; (4) the spiritual cultivation of humanity after the war. This is only the second time in the last 400 years that such a council of bishops has been convened. Pope Pius XII's intention is to prevent today's iron-fisted war perspective and tomorrow's famine and sin. Therefore, it is necessary to convene a council of bishops from around the world to show solemnity. Therefore, once this conference is held, its importance can be compared to the council convened in 1545, because what was discussed at that time was the Catholic reform in response to "Protestantism" (ie, Christianity), and what is to be discussed this time is an event related to the welfare of all mankind.

Talks on the European War (33)

### Secrets of American Diplomacy

Two famous American journalists, Joseph Alsop and Robert Kintner, collected various materials on American diplomacy after the outbreak of the current European war and compiled them into a book called "American White Paper," which explains a period of diplomatic history from the Munich Conference to the outbreak of the war, revealing many insider situations that the world does not know. The book has now sold to its seventh edition, and the following is an abridged translation:

At 2:40 am on September 1, 1939, the telephone on the switchboard at the White House in Washington rang. The sleepy night operator connected the line and heard a voice say, "Long distance call from Paris." Then another very sharp and rough voice said, "Can I speak to the President?" The operator recognized the voice of the US Ambassador to France, Bullitt, and transferred it to the President's secretary, Miss LeHand, saying that Ambassador Bullitt wanted to speak to the President. Bullitt was one of the two or three people who were qualified to speak directly to the President during the day or night, so Miss LeHand instructed, "Connect it." The operator then connected the call to the President's bedroom. The President had been having some restless nights in those days. Hearing the phone ring, he immediately sat up and picked up the phone by the bed.

"Who is it?"

"It's Bill Bullitt, Mr. President."

"Oh, Bill." (Note: Bill is Bullitt's nickname)

"Tony Biddle (US Ambassador to Poland) just called from Warsaw and said that several German divisions have penetrated deep into Polish territory and are in fierce fighting. Several bombers have been spotted over Warsaw. He said that the phone suddenly went dead when he got to this point. He wanted to report to you before talking to me, but after spending half an hour, he still didn't get through."

"Well, Bill, it has finally happened. God bless us."

The two talked for a few more minutes. Bullitt asked the President to try to "try not to let them lay eggs on us," meaning to ask the President to send a telegram requesting the belligerent countries to avoid bombing unarmed cities. The two also discussed ways to evacuate American expatriates in Europe. Then the President said, "Bill, thank you. I'm going to discuss it with Cordell (Cordell Hull's nickname), etc.," and hung up the phone.

In those few plain conversations, the US government already knew that World War II had broken out.

The State Department's telegraph room is the nerve center of the entire department. The telegraph machines moved incessantly, reporting confidential information about Chamberlain and Daladier's hopes, hints from the German Foreign Ministry, secret talks with the Soviet government, new incidents in the Yangtze River Basin of China, and threats felt in the Balkans. These telegrams were translated into plain code, copied, stamped with the words "Confidential," and then transmitted to various offices throughout the day. First on the south side of the second floor, they were submitted to Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary Welles, then taken upstairs to Moffat, the head of the West European Division, and finally, according to the source of the telegram, they were delivered to the "British," "Spanish," "Italian," or "Scandinavian" desks, where the responsible civil servants categorized and analyzed them one by one.

At the same time, at the White House, President Roosevelt received three large batches of telegrams every day. On most days, he also received special reports from ambassadors and ministers stationed in various countries, such as long-distance calls, special reports, and confidential airmail. He often used the day's intelligence as reading material before going to bed, making notes on the reports for processing the next day. However, if the issues discussed by the State Department were major, he was also reported at any time. At this time, he read various relevant documents, summoned Hull or Welles for talks, and conveyed his opinions in "memos," instructing the direction of the State Department's discussions. Then, the State Department used telegrams to instruct the envoys stationed in various countries to comply.

The 1938 Munich Four-Power Conference was the key to the change in American foreign policy. Before the Munich Conference, American world policy was mainly based on echoing others, but at the end of August 1938, US Ambassador to Germany Hugh Wilson reported that Hitler's ambition to invade Czechoslovakia was unshakable, and the United States adopted a positive and realistic policy. All hopes for peace were dashed, and the United States could no longer stand idly by.

By September 24, the relationship between Hitler and Chamberlain, Daladier, and Benes was extremely tense. The next day, the State Department and the White House were busy all day, and as a result, they drafted a telegram in which President Roosevelt appealed for peace, and sent it simultaneously to the governments of Britain, France, Germany, and Czechoslovakia at 1:00 AM on the 26th.

Hitler's reply involved the Treaty of Versailles, and on September 27, war seemed imminent. The President gathered the heads of government in his bedroom early in the morning for an emergency meeting to decide on two final steps: one was for the President to earnestly send a telegram to Mussolini in his personal capacity, asking him to mediate peace; and the other was for Welles and State Department Assistant Secretary Berle to rush to draft a reply to Hitler's telegram.

However, when drafting the reply, the issue of what action the United States should take was also involved. Initially, it was proposed to convene a peace conference, scheduled to be held at the Peace Palace in The Hague on September 29, with the United States sending an observer to attend. Then it was proposed that the United States would also be willing to participate in discussions on any economic issues parallel to political issues. But when these two drafts were sent to the White House, Hull strongly opposed them, and the President did not approve of them either. Therefore, it was decided to only advocate "holding a meeting in a neutral location in Europe" to discuss peace terms. Welles also spoke by phone with the ambassadors to Britain and France, asking them to inquire about Chamberlain and Daladier's reactions. At dinner time, the two ambassadors telegraphed back saying that the governments of their respective countries had expressed their agreement.

That evening, Hull, Welles, and Berle met with the President again. The President had been busy all day revising the telegram to Mussolini. When he was revising the draft reply to Hitler, news came that the German army would launch an attack that night, and the President was furious upon hearing this. But such news was still speculation and could not be fully believed. Time was of the essence, so he no longer argued over words and sent two telegrams directly calling for peace. The President signed them separately at 9:30 and sent them out that night.

What happened the next day is already well known to the world, namely that Hitler invited Chamberlain to a meeting, and Mussolini also acceded to the President's request to mediate, so the situation was temporarily saved from danger. (To be continued)

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Thorough Arrangements for Smooth Taxpayers' Meeting; Japanese to Send Observers to Attend; Foreign Nationals Offer Opinions on Council's Finances

Japanese taxpayers held a general meeting at the Japanese Club at 2:00 PM on the 1st (yesterday), officially making a final decision to refuse to participate in the special taxpayers' meeting to be reconvened at the Race Course on the 5th to vote on the Municipal Council's 40% tax increase proposal. This news was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now heard that the reasons relied upon by the Japanese are approximately two points: (1) Japanese taxpayers believe that their views on the tax increase issue were fully expressed by Lin Xiongji at the special taxpayers' meeting held on January 23rd. Therefore, they unanimously expressed their support for the proposal of the Standing Committee of the Japanese Taxpayers' Association not to participate in the special taxpayers' meeting. (2) Japanese taxpayers believe that the next meeting of the special taxpayers' meeting will continue the discussion on the agenda of the previous meeting. Therefore, they believe that their participation is a "meaningless" act, and therefore take a blatantly refusing attitude. However, according to The Times, the Standing Committee of the Japanese Taxpayers' Association will meet in early next week to elect observers to attend the special taxpayers' meeting.

Arrangements Ready, Security Increased

The Municipal Council has maintained a calm attitude from the beginning regarding the interruption of the meeting on the 23rd, especially Chairman Fessenden and Vice-Chairman Allman. Even after the Japanese threatened not to participate in the reopened meeting, they were relieved to set it aside, believing that it would not form a major difficulty. They are still actively preparing for the reopening, and various measures have been prepared one after another. At that time, in addition to taxpayers entering the venue with green card paper carefully printed voting tickets, foreigners will not be allowed to enter unless specially permitted. The security aspect is more thorough than last time. Additional police officers are stationed at the two gates on Bubbling Well Road and the main entrance at the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Medhurst Road, paying serious attention to people entering and exiting. At the entrance to the meeting hall, police officers and sergeants of various nationalities will be stationed to check the voting tickets. Also, around the rostrum, because some Japanese taxpayers surged to the front of the stage at the last time in an attempt to demolish the rostrum, measures have been taken to separate it from the taxpayers' seats. Therefore, it will not be as convenient for taxpayers to go on stage to speak as it was last time.

The Proposal Is Expected to Pass Satisfactorily

The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the day after tomorrow. The agenda already discussed last time will not be repeated. The meeting will still be chaired by Consul General Hill, Chairman of the Consular Body, and Mr. Nash, Assistant Secretary of the Municipal Council, will serve as the secretary of the meeting. After the meeting begins, the chairman will first submit the amendment proposed by the Japanese to the assembly for formal voting. Then British taxpayer Mr. Liddell will propose a second amendment regarding the surtax case, stating that the estimated value of houses used by homeowners will be increased by 40% starting in January of this year, and the Municipal Council may also levy additional land tax on undeveloped land. This case was seconded by Audy. After Municipal Council Chairman Fessenden's defense, it will be submitted to the assembly for voting. Then the surtax issue will be completely resolved. Moving on to discuss the increase in license fees, Fessenden will state the reasons. After Liddell proposed and Mcguson seconded a request to amend to avoid increasing the license fee for milk sheds, the assembly will formally vote on it, and then the meeting will adjourn. It is expected that the meeting can be concluded within one and a half hours.

Borrowing Money Is Not Expected to Be Implemented

The total amount of spring property tax, etc. in the International Settlement is approximately 15 million yuan. It should have been collected at the beginning of this year, but because the Municipal Council is waiting for the decision of the Western taxpayers' meeting on the surtax case, it has not yet been collected. It was previously rumored that the Municipal Council intended to borrow money temporarily to make up for it, in order to pay the salaries of employees and interest on bonds in the past month. This statement cannot be confirmed, but according to observations by relevant parties, the postponement of this meeting is only for two weeks. In this short period of time, the Municipal Council is unlikely to experience serious financial difficulties due to the uncollected tax revenue. The surtax case, once passed at the reopened meeting the day after tomorrow, the Municipal Council will be able to collect the spring taxes according to the new tax rate from the next day. Economic difficulties will therefore not arise.

### Increasing Revenue Should Be Accompanied by Reducing Expenditure

Expert's Suggestions

A famous economic commentator, Aless, published an article in the English-language The China Weekly Review yesterday, criticizing the Municipal Council's financial problems and offering many suggestions for increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. He stated that there are many people in this city who would rather see the Municipal Council go bankrupt than increase taxes, but they do not know that if the Municipal Council goes bankrupt, at least three major unfavorable events will occur. First, the burden borne by taxpayers will definitely not be reduced due to the bankruptcy of the Municipal Council. Second, if bankruptcy unfortunately occurs, it is precisely a good opportunity for the Japanese and a certain party to squeeze in. If this happens, the interests of this city will be harmed, and even the concession system will be shaken. Third, the bankruptcy of the Municipal Council will cause the only remaining commercial prosperity in this city to disappear. Based on the above reasons, Aless urged taxpayers to pass the Municipal Council's tax increase proposal. If it is passed because taxpayers agree, it does not mean that taxpayers sincerely support the Council's financial policy. The Municipal Council should live up to the public's expectations and implement measures to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Aless also made the following suggestions, saying that Shanghai people have clearly expressed their opposition to the method of indirectly and directly increasing the salaries of senior Municipal Council officials. Every time the Municipal Council increases the salaries of officials, the income of junior officials is extremely limited, while senior officials can often get hundreds of yuan. This fact is incomprehensible. I believe that the Municipal Council should stipulate in the future that after an official's salary exceeds a certain amount, their salary will no longer be increased, or they will be given allowances. In terms of reducing expenditure, the city's stock exchange is the best and most reasonable target for taxation. If we can levy a 2% tax on the city's stock exchange, we can get 2.5 million yuan a year, which is a considerable amount. Finally, the Council can also levy wharf fees on all goods transported to Shanghai. In addition, it can also tax vacant land without buildings.

Westerners' Criticism

Yesterday, a Westerner sent a letter to the North China Daily News, criticizing the impropriety of the Municipal Council's tax collection methods and demanding prompt improvement. It stated that when your newspaper commented on the assassination of Fessenden, it said that Fessenden's assassination was precisely when he was trying to pass the 40% tax increase proposal "for the greatest benefit of the whole society." We cannot help but have the following questions to ask: Can it be called "striving for the greatest benefit of the whole society" for the Municipal Council to repeatedly increase taxes on people who are already burdened with heavy taxes, causing prices to rise, while showing special favor to those who powerfully assist the Municipal Council, or those whose existence depends on the Municipal Council, and not daring to touch a hair of theirs? Can it be called "striving for the greatest benefit of the whole society" for the Municipal Council to tax important daily necessities and houses, while ignoring large businesses with great profits? From this, it can be seen that the current tax system is full of errors. If we tax commercial profits now, not only can the funds needed by the Municipal Council be obtained, but also the public's burden of house tax and increased license fees can be avoided. If the Municipal Council can further levy heavy taxes on gambling houses, stock exchanges, and prostitutes, then even land tax can be abolished. After all, all over the world, luxury goods are taxed heavily, while the taxation of the public's necessities should be done with caution.

### Merchant Corps Chinese Company Encampment

On the previous two days (the 1st and 2nd), the Chinese Company of the International Merchant Corps, following the Translators' Company, held its encampment for collective training. Despite it being the beginning of the old lunar year and the weather being cold and windy, the regular members of the company still enthusiastically obeyed orders and arrived at the field. At noon on the 1st, the entire company, carrying luggage, gathered at the Public Works Department parade ground. First, Company Commander Major Chen Shixia, Deputy Company Commander Lieutenant Yu Xian'en, and other officers called the roll, reviewed the ranks, inspected uniforms, and gave speeches. Then, according to the predetermined order, they had lunch at 1:00 PM. After the meal, the courses began, directed by military advisor Huang Guohua and other senior non-commissioned officers. From 2:00 PM, Lieutenant Wang Tingkui instructed on the construction of sandbag fortifications. At 3:30 PM, barbed wire was erected. Tea and snacks were served at 5:00 PM, strategic exercises took place at 6:00 PM, dinner at 8:00 PM, a lecture on street fighting at 9:00 PM, and lights out at 11:00 PM. The entire company stayed overnight in the Merchant Corps Club gymnasium. The next morning, at 6:00 AM, they got up. At 7:00 AM, Lieutenant Zhang Tinggui demonstrated rapid-fire rifle practice. After breakfast at 7:45 AM, they marched to Yuanmingyuan Road for street fighting exercises. At 10:00 AM, there was a sand table lecture, with lectures given by Lieutenants Zhou Qing'en, Xu Shaomei, and Zhong Yuting. At 11:30 AM, they practiced with machine guns. At 12:30 PM, lunch was served. In the afternoon, at 1:00 PM, Lieutenant Li Yushu lectured on strategies for dispersing rioters and preventing riots. After the lecture, they returned to Yuanmingyuan Road for practical exercises. A tea party was held at 5:00 PM, and comedians Cheng Xiaoting and Guan Xianling came to the field to perform voluntarily to add to the amusement. It was not until about 6:30 PM that Company Commander Chen assembled the team to express his thanks before dismissing them. It is reported that the encampment was very successful in terms of performance and order. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Corps, Lieutenant Colonel Mann, and the former Commander, Colonel Henpei, both came to inspect and expressed their pleasure at the vigorous spirit and serious practice of the members.

### National Rice Shipped to Shanghai: Informal Contacts Made; Public Works Department and Others Exchanged Views

The "North China Daily News" reports: "Mayor" Chen Gongbo hosted a banquet for the members of the Public Works Department's Food Supply Subcommittee, such as Sir Marshall and O'Connor, at the Cathay Hotel last Thursday. This meeting was of an informal nature, and it is widely believed that they exchanged views on the rice situation in the city. At the same time, although the value of legal tender fluctuates, the rice situation has indeed improved. There is currently a sufficient supply of rice in the city to meet the needs for the next few months, and a large amount of foreign rice will arrive soon. Therefore, the future of the people's food supply can be described as optimistic. The Public Concession authorities previously indirectly appealed to the Japanese authorities in the city to allow national rice to be shipped in without obstruction. It is reported that the Public Works Department has not yet received a definite reply after issuing this appeal.

### Oppressed Nationalities of East Asia Unite to Fight with China; Korean Volunteer Army Officially Established; Liberation to be Achieved Upon China's Victory

According to the recently published "Millard's Review," Japan's decades of rule since seizing Taiwan and Korea in the Sino-Japanese War has only created hatred among the oppressed people. It is only today, with China's rise to fight, that these people have found new hope. The Taiwanese are all of Chinese descent, and their land has always been a part of China. Korea has always been a semi-independent Chinese tributary state. In recent years, oppressed and small nationalities of East Asia have sought a country to lead East Asia, and instead of going to Tokyo, they have gathered in Chongqing. A large number of Koreans are helping China in the war, and so are aspiring Taiwanese.

Chiang Kai-shek Provides Assistance

However, there is a slight difference. The Koreans' aspiration is to restore their homeland, and their nature is that of an ally of China. Taiwan is originally Chinese territory, and its nature is just like the self-defense of the soldiers of the Northeast. For the past twenty years, Koreans have had a secret government in China, which has gained the support of Koreans abroad. Acts of terrorism against Japan have been heard from time to time. The political leaders of these Koreans are now all in Chongqing. Three weeks ago, Chiang Kai-shek specially approved the formation of a Korean army to fight their oppressors on the battlefield with their blood.

Official Armed Forces Fight Together for Victory

In fact, Korean youths have long been mixed into the Chinese army to help in the war. A few days ago, a group celebrated its second anniversary. This is the "Korean Volunteer Army," which currently has three hundred members. In addition to war work, its task is to also focus on winning over Koreans in the Japanese army to help China. However, Koreans were previously unable to receive military equipment. Now, with government approval, they will be officially armed and renamed the "Korean Volunteer Army." However, these people are not fighting to restore the Yi dynasty (the Yi dynasty was weak and surrendered to Japan, which Koreans deeply hate). Their purpose is to establish a new independent and democratic country, firmly believing that they will achieve this goal with China's victory.

### French Ambassador Cosme Has Indeed Returned to Shanghai from Vietnam

French Ambassador to China Cosme left Shanghai for Chongqing five months ago. During this time, Cosme stayed in Chongqing, the wartime capital of China. During this time, Cosme met with central authorities to explain the situation of the Pétain government and the French Vietnamese government regarding China. Then, he went to Chengdu to preside over the cancellation of the French consulate in Chengdu. On February 6th, he flew to Hong Kong from Chongqing on a China National Aviation Corporation plane. Then, due to the tense relationship between French Vietnam and Thailand, Cosme hurriedly bought a boat to Saigon to meet with Lieutenant General Decoux, staying in Vietnam for almost a month. Now that his mission is completed, he came to Shanghai on the French mail ship General Pershing. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, who inquired with the French consulate, the ambassador did indeed arrive in port at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. He is currently residing in his private residence on Haig Road and does not plan to go elsewhere in the short term, planning to stay in Shanghai for a long time.

### Legal Advisor to the French Municipal Council Still Vacant

Since the legal advisor to the French Municipal Council, Dugue, was assassinated last year, his position as legal advisor to the French Municipal Council has, according to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who inquired with relevant parties yesterday, remained vacant because the Municipal Council has not yet appointed anyone else. The vacancy left by Dugue is still vacant, and a successor has not yet been decided. The position of chairman of the French Concession Rent Mediation Committee is also vacant, and the committee's work has been suspended.

### Yunnan-Burma Road Now Open for Postal Service

The Kunming Post Office now has a batch of mail destined for Shanghai, Hong Kong, and overseas, loaded onto trucks and transported to Lashio, from where it will be exported via Rangoon. Afterwards, there will be several more batches transported and exported via this route.

### Most Workers at the Tushanwan Orphanage Reinstated; Dismissed Workers Are All Specialists

Regarding the incident involving more than 500 employees of the Tushanwan Orphanage in Xujiahui, a labor dispute arose earlier due to demands for improved treatment. The orphanage initially agreed to cancel the original rice subsidy of $4.50 per month and instead subsidize one dou of Xian rice for adults and five sheng for children. The entire labor force was satisfied and resumed work. However, the orphanage suddenly changed its mind, causing the labor dispute to recur. It is now known that the arrested labor representative, Shi Jiaping, was released the day before yesterday. The orphanage immediately paid the dismissed employees two or three months' wages. The other employees, more than 420 in number, officially resumed work at 7:00 AM yesterday. As for the more than 80 dismissed employees, they have organized a group to appeal to people from all walks of life for sympathy, hoping that they will be hired. Among them are specialists such as typesetters, coppersmiths, carpenters, and carvers. They are now eager for people to hire them if needed. These workers all reside at Dawei Nong, Wu Daitou, Yujiahui.

### Small Island off the Coast of Fuqing Occupied; Shipping to Shanghai and Fujian Obstructed

According to shipping industry news yesterday, a small island off the coast of Fuqing in Fujian Province was occupied by the Japanese Navy in mid-last month, further obstructing shipping routes between Shanghai and Fujian. After the Japanese Navy announced the blockade of shipping in Zhejiang and Fujian on July 15 of last year, shipping between Shanghai and Fujian relied solely on this route, with foreign ships such as the Xinanna, Xin'anli, Yongfeng, Yongtai, Kailin, and Ma Le operating. It is reported that the Xinanna planned to sail from Shanghai to Fuqing last month, but was detained before it could set sail, causing the remaining ships to be idle on the Shanghai coast. It is also learned that the British firm Yilong Steamship Company in this port is seeking to restore the Shanghai-Fujian shipping route and has already sent the Shenyou to test sail to Sandu'ao in the Min Estuary.

### Prices of Medicinal Materials Rise Again; Burden on Patients Increases Daily

Since the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian were blockaded by the Japanese army, goods have had to be transported through roundabout routes. Most of the domestic medicinal herbs are produced in Sichuan and Guangdong. Since the seaports were blockaded, they have all been coming to Shanghai via Hong Kong. Recently, due to the rise in the Hong Kong exchange rate, the price has increased by 20 to 30 Hong Kong dollars per 100 catties, so the market prices have all increased sharply. For example, Xisha Mi Guangmuxiang has increased by 20% and 40%, and Da Fu Apricot Kernels have increased by 10% and 12%. The prices of goods from Sichuan and Yunnan are particularly high. For example, Chuan Bei, Huang Fu Kuai, and Musk have increased by more than ten times compared to the second half of last year. Hong Kong is also the top destination for Shanghai's exports. Since the Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping route was suspended, the annual decrease in medicinal materials going to Wenzhou has reached 30 to 40 million yuan. In addition, Danshen produced in Chuzhou has decreased in production, making it unable to meet demand. Therefore, the selling price has increased from 70 yuan per piece to 200 yuan, and there is a feeling that there are no goods available on the market. The prices of other goods have all skyrocketed due to the increase in the red plate. The prices of retail medicines have increased by an average of one-half, so the burden on patients has increased accordingly.

### Western Reporter Praises Hunan-Guangxi Railway; Vehicles Concentrated to Strengthen Military and Freight Transport; Staff Show Enthusiasm and Work Hard

Ips Tan, correspondent for the English-language "China Press," writes: "Before the war, China did not have many railways. Since the start of the war, most have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, and a few have been destroyed by the Chinese army themselves. But one thing is worth noting: most of the locomotives, vehicles, and freight cars of the original railways have not fallen into enemy hands. Now, a large number are concentrated on the Hunan section of the Yuehan Railway and the railway from Hengyang to Guangxi. These two railways are now the center of free China's transportation and the remnants of the old railways, which are precious. In addition to transporting goods, they can also mobilize large numbers of troops at high speed to the main battlefields in three directions (one towards Wuhan, one towards Guangzhou, and one towards the Guangxi border). China has repeatedly won victories on these three battlefields last year, greatly increasing China's confidence in fighting, but at the same time greatly damaging the prestige of the Japanese army. Among them, the Hunan-Guangxi Railway was built and rushed after the start of the war, which is an amazing miracle."

Luxurious Sleeping Cars, Clean and Neat

The reporter traveled to the interior, passing through areas of fire and areas where there were no roads. The transportation was extremely difficult. One day, he suddenly arrived at the Chinese railway money south of Hunan and unexpectedly saw a miracle. After four years of hard fighting in China, everyone must think that the train must be broken and the passengers will be unbearable. However, the car that the reporter entered was the most luxurious sleeping car, clean and tidy, with all the facilities complete. Even the manager of the guard car was dressed in brilliant uniforms and full of spirit, making it extremely comfortable.

Vehicles from All Routes Concentrated Here

The reason for this is very simple: the essence of Chinese vehicles, such as the green express trains made in Belgium and the famous blue steel trains of Pinghu, did not fall into the hands of the Japanese army. They went with the army and are now concentrated on these two routes. At the forks of major stations, vehicles are parked and gathered like clouds, covering the entire view. The cars are all printed with the words "Beining," "Jinpu," "Jinghu," etc. A few are even marked with the words "China Eastern Railway." The original railway personnel all came with the vehicles, so at each station and on the train, you can see staff speaking different languages from all directions. Most of these people have gone through great hardships to rescue railway materials.

Hengyang Has Become a Transportation Hub

The car arrived in Hengyang. Hengyang is a city that has developed with the war. Its terrain is important. Three years ago, it was just a small city. Today, it is the main transportation hub of the country. From here, the main roads to all parts of free China radiate. No matter where a large number of reinforcements are needed, or a province or region is suffering from famine and needs assistance, or construction in western China needs machinery and steel, the way to provide assistance must pass through Hengyang. Because Hengyang is a new city, its appearance is different from the old styles of the major cities in Hunan. The streets are wide, and the shade is neatly arranged. Most of the people come from other provinces, so the language is not uniform. Railway factories and other factories are booming.

### Police Eradicate Opium and Gambling; Splendid Gambling Den Uncovered; Search of the Silver Palace Wine Shop Upstairs Lasted Three Hours; Gambling Equipment Plentiful, Opium Equipment Valuable

The "North China Daily News" reports: The Public Works Department's Police Department is making every effort to eradicate opium and gambling in the Public Concession. Yesterday (the 1st) at 2:00 PM, detectives uncovered a magnificent opium and gambling den on the upper floor of the Silver Palace Wine Shop at 982 Fuxu Road. A large number of gambling tools were seized, such as roulette, apple betting, dice, chips, and dozens of tables and chairs, all of which were loaded onto trucks and taken to the police station. In addition, detectives also confiscated a large number of cigarettes, cigars, cash boxes, application forms for entering the den, account books, wine, and male and female uniforms for shakers. The detectives finished searching at 6:00 PM.

Opium and Gambling Intertwined, Magnificent and Splendid

As a result, not only was it discovered that it was a gambling den, but it was also found that this evil place, which supplied opium smoking, was operated by a gang of foreigners, occupying a total of six rooms. Four of them were used for gambling, and the other two were luxuriously equipped for people to smoke drugs. Therefore, detectives also confiscated a full set of opium smoking equipment, including three silver-inlaid ebony pipes, opium lamps, and ashtrays. Detectives also went to the drinking room of the gambling den and confiscated account books, wine glasses, soap, and towels. In a room behind the drinking room, large and small gambling tools were being manufactured and were also seized. At the time, there were eight people in the gambling den who were caught off guard and arrested. It is widely believed that after interrogation, they will implicate others. As for whether any foreigners were arrested, there was no confirmed news last night.

Six Places Uncovered in Half a Month

The police have been paying attention to this gambling den for more than a day and knew that it was engaged in small-scale gambling. However, after a thorough search yesterday, a large number of gambling tools were seized, and it was learned that the operators were preparing to expand the scope. It is reported that the gambling den uncovered yesterday was the most magnificent of all the gambling dens that the police have closed down in the past month and a half. Its furniture, gambling tools, uniforms, and silver-inlaid opium pipes are more luxurious than the equipment in gambling dens on the roads outside the concession. Since December 26 of last year, the Public Concession police have uncovered six gambling dens to date, bringing the eradication of opium and gambling in the concession one step closer to realization. The first gambling den uncovered by the Police Department recently was located on Jing'an Temple Road, and a Portuguese was arrested on the spot. Afterwards, gambling dens were successively uncovered on Gordon Road, Haig Road, Deyi Building, and Cangzhou Hotel. In addition, detectives from the Police Department's Narcotics Division also uncovered an opium den on Huaji Road, arresting two people and seizing raw opium and heroin worth 20,000 yuan.

### Court Clerks Demand Subsidies; Resolution Possible in the Short Term

The Ministry of Judicial Administration, in consideration of the poverty of judicial officials in Shanghai, has ordered that officials of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, and the Second Prison be subsidized an additional 40 yuan each month starting in October of last year. However, there was no clear order to issue this 40-yuan subsidy to clerks, guards, and wardens, so the clerks and others have risen up to demand equal treatment from their superiors, but this has not been resolved. Therefore, the clerks and others have decided to demand that their superiors follow the Ministry of Judicial Administration's previous instructions, that the president of the court can handle matters at his discretion based on local conditions, and quickly provide relief by subsidizing them all 40 yuan each month starting in October of last year, according to the example of subsidies for employees such as record clerks. Fortunately, the court and prison authorities deeply understand the hardships of the clerks and others, and it is expected that this matter can be resolved satisfactorily in the short term.

### The Identity of Ms. Samson, Who Jumped to Her Death

The "Continental Daily" reports: Last Friday, the 5th, a Western woman jumped from the Washington Apartments on Avenue Petain and died instantly. The French Concession Police Department has now identified the woman as Ms. Samson, 52 years old, originally from Stockholm, Sweden. She came to Shanghai in 1913 and lived at 104 Huanlong Road, making a living by teaching English and French. The motive for her suicide is still unknown, but it is said that the woman has been living alone for many years and feels quite pained.

### Robbery on Rue Massenet; One Thief Arrested on the Spot

Yesterday morning at 8:15 AM, three robbers armed with weapons broke into 26 Rue Massenet in the French Concession and robbed the place. They then fled with the stolen goods. One of the thieves fled to the intersection of Avenue Foch and Chengdu Road, where he was chased by the victim who was shouting behind him. He was arrested by a constable from the Public Concession Police Department. A pistol and three bullets were found on the thief's body and were all escorted to the police station to pursue the accomplices.

### Bizarre Fetus with Inverted Features; Dr. Qu Explains the Origins of Development; Specimen Stored at the Sheng Sheng Hospital for Research

On a certain day this month, a woman went to the Sheng Sheng Hospital at 57 Rue Sa po sei because she was pregnant and nearing her due date and her abdomen was hurting frequently. The hospital's director, Dr. Qu Shaohang's wife, Dr. Yao Yingnai, performed surgery to deliver a female fetus. Upon close examination of its face, its features were different from those of ordinary people. The nose was on the forehead, with the nostrils facing upwards. The eyes were below the nose, with the two eyeballs joined together, like twin lotuses just blooming. The eyelids were connected, like a goldfish's eyes spitting out. The ears were in the neck, just like a large mouth gaping open. Upon careful inspection of the mouth slit, there was no trace of it.

Scientific Explanation of Monster Formation

According to Dr. Qu, the common people say that monsters are formed by the spirits and ghosts that haunt them, and they are often ashamed and disgusted by them. However, based on the embryology of science, it may be a developmental disorder in the early stages of life in the womb, or it may be that the fetal body is dead, but the chorion and amnion continue to proliferate. What is called small to large is not large or too large, what is called short to long is not long or too long, what is called thin to thick is not thick or too thick, what is called solid to hollow does not become hollow, what is called simple to complex is not complex, what is called joining and separating does not separate, and what is called separating and joining does not join. What is there to be ashamed of? What is there to be disgusted by?

Strange Fetal Monsters

Throughout history, there have been countless types of fetal deformities, in a thousand shapes and ten thousand states. There are those with one body and two heads, those with two bodies and one head, those with one head and two faces, those without hands or feet, those with a head but no body, and those with a body but no head. These are all caused by abnormal development. However, the shape of this child is truly an unprecedented deformity in obstetrics.

Explanation of the Development of Each Part of This Fetus

The reasons for this development can be roughly explained as follows: the nose is originally located in the center of the face and is the boundary between the eyes. Now, because the lower part has separated and flipped upwards, the nostrils are facing upwards and the eyes are below the nose. The two eyes are originally separated left and right by the nose as a boundary. Now that the nose is upwards, the two eyes are joined together without separation, so the shape is joined but in fact separated. The ball is joined, so the eyelid is naturally connected. The entire part below the eyes does not develop, so there is no mouth or jaw. Since there is no jaw, the auricles on both sides naturally drag closer to each other. What is called shaped like a large mouth gaping open is a natural consequence.

Shape of Deformed Fetus

### French Public Bus Crushes Pedestrian

Every morning, the French Tram Company sends public buses to the No. 16 Fish Market to transport fresh fish and vegetables and vendors to various small vegetable markets to serve the market. Yesterday morning at 6:59 AM, a French 22nd Route 818 public bus loaded with vendors, fish, and vegetables was traveling east to west on Avenue Edward VII. As it approached the intersection of Old North Gate Street, a man of about 50 years of age was crossing the road from south to north and was unable to retreat, causing him to be knocked down by the front left wheel of the bus, crushing his skull and causing blood to flow all over his face. The police arrived and sent him to the Guangci Hospital, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 3:00 PM. The police took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall. A South City pass was found on the deceased's body, with the name Li Mingbao, age 50, with no registered address, only stating residence in the South City, so there was no way to find the deceased's family. The police took photos and waited for the family to identify the body. The body was temporarily buried by the charity hall.

### Fire on Tangshan Road; Young Woman Burned to Death

A stone gate house at No. 119, Huaxingfang, 326 Lane, Tangshan Road, Hongkou, Baoding Road, caught fire yesterday afternoon at approximately 2:30 PM, instantly emitting thick smoke and raging flames, spreading to the neighboring house at No. 117. When the fire was raging, a young woman, Qin Zhou, age 29, inside No. 119, which was where the fire started, was unable to escape and was burned to death in the fire, her head and face charred beyond recognition, a tragic sight. Later, the fire brigade drove to the scene and, after an hour and a half, first extinguished the fire by drawing water to the fire scene, and then dug out a female body from the rubble and sent it to the coroner's office for examination. The fire destroyed two stone gate houses.

### Deaths by Misadventure

Tea Boy at the Stock Exchange: At approximately 8:35 AM yesterday morning, a man jumped from the window of the 7th floor of the Stock Exchange Building at 429 Jiujiang Road and fell into the 4th lane of the building, fracturing his skull and causing brain matter to flow. The Chinese constable No. 2007 from Lao Zha heard the news and rushed to the scene, urgently calling an ambulance to accompany him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly thereafter. It is reported that the deceased was named Lu Fengsheng, in his early fifties, from Cixi, and was a tea boy in the accounting department of the Stock Exchange. He was allegedly forced to take his own life due to financial difficulties. After the hospital transferred the body to the coroner's office for examination, it was coffined.

Yan Daoyi from Changshu: Yan Daoyi, a 49-year-old resident of No. 17, Lane 44, Rue du Père Huc, Changshu, had recently lost his job and was unable to support his family, leading him to take his own life by poisoning himself on the afternoon of the 31st of last month. At 7:00 PM that night, his son discovered him and sent him to the Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died at 8:00 AM on the 1st. His body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall, awaiting collection by his family.

Woman Suffering from Mental Illness: At 5:00 PM on the 1st, an unnamed woman, approximately 30 years old and neatly dressed, due to suffering from mental illness, was alone and incoherent in the middle of the road at the intersection of Avenue Paul Beau and Avenue Petain in the French Concession, laughing and joking abnormally. A patrol officer found her, took her to the police station, and sent her to the mental hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour for treatment, but she died at 11:00 AM on the 2nd. The hospital notified the police station, but as there was no way to contact her family, the body was taken by car to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for photographs, awaiting identification by her family.

### Two Robberies Last Night

On Avenue Amiral Courbet and Gordon Road in Shanghai West, at approximately 7:40 PM last night, two robbers stopped a man and robbed him of a coat, a wallet containing 26 yuan in cash, and a check.

On Rue Disraeli and Rue Chreme in Hongkou, at approximately 8:35 PM last night, a man was passing through the area when he was stopped by four robbers. One of them brandished a pistol and robbed him of a long gown and a scarf.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that it was cold in Shandong, here, and along the Chinese coast, with clear skies turning cloudy and gentle seasonal winds. There was snowfall in southern Japan. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this port was a high of 48.0 and a low of 21.4.

### Scoto Cup: Chinese Despair - Yu Yu Also Loses to North Seston - 2-4, First Half 1-2

The second week of the Scoto Cup featured four matches. After Tung Wah's crushing defeat to West Point and St. Francis Xavier's overwhelming victory over the Jews, the Franco-Portuguese rematch the day before saw the French prevail 4-1. The remaining match between Yu Yu and North Seston took place yesterday afternoon at Jiaozhou Park. Before the match, Yu Yu's chances were highly touted. Although North Seston was a Division A team, they were considered to be of lesser quality. Yu Yu, with ample strength and a complete lineup, had high hopes. Unexpectedly, in yesterday's match, they lost 2-4 due to overconfidence. Zhang Lin'gen and Jiang Chao, internal defenders, overstepped their roles to attack, leaving the defense vulnerable and resulting in a crushing defeat. They were eliminated, ending the Chinese teams' chances in the Scoto Cup. Tung Wah and Yousheng were eliminated earlier. The high hopes pinned on Yu Yu, the last remaining hope, proved to be a mirage. The semi-final week will feature only foreign teams: the French, St. Francis Xavier, and North Seston. West Point is considered the strongest contender, and the final week is expected to be a battle between West Point and the French for the championship. Yu Yu attacked first, but neither side scored in the first ten minutes. In the 13th minute, Wang Zhangbao committed a foul, and Kai Lu took a free kick from 30 yards out. The ball landed perfectly in front of the goal, and Ke Kelun headed it in, leaving Zheng Tongyu unable to save it, opening the scoring. In the 26th minute, Lai Liao committed a handball, resulting in a penalty. Sun Laojin successfully converted it, tying the score at 1-1. In the 30th minute, Ke Kelun broke through alone, with Zhang Lin'gen and Jiang Chao too far away to return in time. Ke Kelun scored from close range, ending the first half at 2-1. After the restart, in the 14th minute, Tie Funik launched a long shot that found the corner of the net, extending North Seston's lead. Three minutes later, Sun Huipei made a beautiful hook, and Wang Caigao headed it in (3-2). Unexpectedly, in the 20th minute, Ke Kelun broke through the center, making it 4-2 and eliminating Yu Yu. From then on, the Scoto Cup was out of reach for the Chinese teams. To seek revenge, they will have to wait until next year.

### Tung Wah Plays Host - Loses to West Point - Giving Away Three Penalties

This was the first meeting between Tung Wah and West Point in Division A. Currently, Tung Wah holds the top spot in Division A with eight wins and two losses in ten matches, accumulating 16 points. West Point has also played ten matches, but has one more loss than Tung Wah. Unfortunately, in yesterday's match, Tung Wah, despite being in excellent condition, missed three penalty opportunities and suffered a 0-2 defeat. This resulted in a tie between the two teams in the standings, jeopardizing Tung Wah's chances of winning the league championship. The lineups for the two teams yesterday were as follows:

West Point

Bo'erbin, Hutelai, Weiketai, Luoliezhi, Keluoke, Shidengqie, Zhuolunzifu, Fangxueka, Weili Huate, Gelinbo, Nuogeluodaofu

Tung Wah

Qin Bigao, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Cai Shengmiao, Huang Kehou, Chen Yutian, Han Longhai, Dai Linjing, Gao Baozheng, Jia Youliang

West Point kicked off. In the 24th minute, a golden opportunity presented itself. When Chen Yutian crossed the ball, Weiketai, in a moment of confusion, raised both hands to block the ball. Referee Wu Shouheng awarded a penalty. Unexpectedly, Cai Shengmiao bungled it, sending the ball wide. The heavens were merciful. Keluoke forgot himself in the penalty area and touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a second penalty opportunity. Dai Linjing deferred to Cai Shengmiao again. Having failed the first time, Cai was extra cautious this time. However, he was overly cautious and kicked the ball straight into Bo'erbin's hands. Within five minutes, they had missed two penalties. The first half ended 0-0. After the restart, West Point played with vigor. In the fifth minute, Weili passed to Gelinbo, who relayed it to Nuogeluodaofu. He dribbled straight down the field. Li Ning allowed him too much space, and Bigao was too slow to react. The ball slipped under his waist and into the net. West Point took the lead. In the 35th minute, Zhuolunzifu broke past Zhuang Youren, and Qin Bigao failed to stop him again. Zhuo added another goal, sealing Tung Wah's fate with a 2-0 defeat. In the last five minutes, Tung Wah missed their third penalty, which was quite astonishing.

### Ministry of Education Establishes National Martial Arts Textbook Compilation and Review Committee - Openly Soliciting Teaching Materials to Strive for Improvement - Aiming for Popularization to Achieve a Strong Nation and a Strong Race

(Chongqing News) The Ministry of Education believes that Chinese martial arts have a long history of thousands of years, and the depth of its techniques is immeasurable. Practicing martial arts can not only strengthen the body and increase self-defense capabilities but also cultivate a spirit of fearlessness. The physical fitness and spirit of the people are the driving force for promoting all undertakings. Promoting martial arts is a crucial plan. Although martial arts have gradually developed in recent years, they have not yet become widespread. The reason is that there is no unified textbook, which poses difficulties in teaching. Therefore, the National Martial Arts Textbook Compilation and Review Committee has been established to openly solicit martial arts teaching materials, strive for improvement and unification based on scientific principles, and aim for rapid popularization throughout the country to achieve a strong nation and a strong race. Any martial arts experts who submit martial arts books that are deemed qualified by the committee will be publicly acknowledged in the newspaper and given a small reward.

However, the education of special ethnic group women is still lacking. The institute now plans to enroll a pre-teacher training class for special ethnic group women this spring, with a quota of 50 students. They will be recommended by the counties, and classes will begin on March 1st.

### Zhejiang Education Department Proposes Methods for Students to Pay Grain

(Lishui Correspondent) The Zhejiang Education Department believes that public and private secondary schools in Zhejiang Province have had considerable difficulties purchasing food grains for students this semester. Recently, the schools have repeatedly reported that if measures are not taken to prepare for the next semester, the difficulties will become even more severe after the start of the school year, and they have requested solutions. After repeated deliberation, it is proposed that the schools conduct a pilot program this spring for students to pay grain as a subsidy to alleviate some of the difficulties. Personnel have been dispatched and principles for grain payment methods have been drafted. Grain payment is limited to boarding students, and the schools are instructed to abolish any student grain payment methods they have formulated themselves.

### Review and Prospect of Shanghai Industry

— Yu Xielin

Shanghai's industry started very early and developed very quickly. Shanghai is the center of China's international trade, the hub of domestic finance, and has convenient transportation, serving as a collection and distribution center for raw materials and manufactured goods. Therefore, various industries have been established one after another. In the first half of the 24th year, according to the survey of the Central Factory Inspection Office, there were as many as 5,480 factories, accounting for more than half of the factories in the country. In particular, important light industries such as cotton mills, flour mills, and silk industries are concentrated in Shanghai. Therefore, it is appropriate to call Shanghai the industrial center of China.

The "August 13th" Shanghai War broke out, and the areas where factories were concentrated, such as Zhabei, Hongkou, and Nanshi, were all destroyed by artillery fire. The industry that China had painstakingly operated for decades and had begun to take shape suffered serious losses. According to various surveys, more than 2,000 factories were damaged, with total losses amounting to approximately 800 million yuan. This is truly an unprecedented catastrophe for China's national industry.

Abnormal Prosperity of Shanghai Industry

During the Shanghai War, all industries in Shanghai were in a state of stagnation. After the National Army withdrew to the west, Shanghai temporarily entered a state of uneasy peace. Consequently, factories in the concessions resumed operation one after another, and factories that had moved into the concessions from the war zone also sought out sites to start work. In the 27th year, the revival and development of Shanghai industry were significantly vibrant, presenting a prosperous scene. However, how could it rapidly recover its prosperity after the wounds of war? According to the situation at that time, there were approximately the following special reasons: First, after China's industry was destroyed by the occupation, the consumption of manufactured goods throughout the country relied entirely on Shanghai. Although the government authorities actively developed the interior, manufactured goods still needed to be supplied by Shanghai before the industrial base in the interior was established. Therefore, the amount of Shanghai manufactured goods transported to the interior through the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian, as well as the ports of Hong Kong, was extremely large. Second, after Shanghai entered a state of uneasy peace, people from the occupied areas flocked to Shanghai, resulting in a surge in population and an increase in purchasing power, which led to the prosperity of all industries and created a special economic boom. The revival and development of Shanghai's industry was stimulated by this. Therefore, most of the factories newly established during the war were those that manufactured consumer goods. Third, the increase in population and the influx of capital were closely related, and a large amount of capital flowed into Shanghai from the occupied areas. Moreover, since the European War, floating capital from Hong Kong and other areas has also flowed in. As a result, there was an overabundance of floating capital in Shanghai. Generally, prudent capitalists, seeing the improvement in industry, either indirectly invested or directly operated emerging businesses. With ample capital, the development of industry was naturally easy, and the establishment of factories sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Fourth, the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates and the soaring prices of goods brought unprecedented profits. However, because the rise in prices could not keep pace with the rapid fall in exchange rates, there was a perceived need to replace imported goods with domestic products, especially for daily necessities. At the same time, the result of the plummeting exchange rates made Shanghai's prices lower than those of foreign countries, which promoted the export of manufactured goods. Based on these four factors, Shanghai industries all gained substantial profits and presented a prosperous scene. However, this prosperity was actually an abnormal economic boom. The soaring prices of goods were entirely manipulated by speculation, so Shanghai's general industries were in a dire environment. By early May of the 29th year, when exchange rates rose, the prices of general manufactured goods reacted sharply and fell, with cotton yarn and other items falling the most, and general industries suffered a severe blow. The abnormal economic boom of the past two years came to an end.

Developments in Shanghai Industry in the Past Half Year

Since May, Shanghai's industry has entered a state of decline, with some factories reducing production or even shutting down. This reached its peak in August. Although there was a slight improvement after September, it has not been able to completely recover from the decline. The current adverse environment has not improved. The environment and developments of Shanghai industry in the past six months are briefly described below:

(1) Shortage of Raw Materials: The development of Shanghai's industry depends on a sufficient supply of raw materials. The supply of raw materials depends entirely on the surrounding provinces. Since the coastal provinces were occupied one after another after the war, the main resources of the occupied areas, such as cotton, silk, wool, wheat, tobacco, coal, iron, and copper, were all monopolized and controlled by the Japanese, and this became even more severe in the second half of the year. The amount that could be imported into Shanghai was extremely small. For example, China is a cotton-producing country. In the two years before the war, the output reached more than 10 million bales, which was enough to achieve self-sufficiency. The output in the 29th year is estimated to be around 8 million bales. The cotton production in North China has long been prohibited from export, and the cotton production in Central China has also been almost completely controlled. The amount that can be transported to Shanghai for consumption by cotton mills is very limited. Therefore, the survival of cotton mills depends on the supply of foreign cotton. The degree to which flour mills lack raw materials is even more severe than that of cotton mills. In August, the number of days each factory was open was only two and a half days. There was an increase in September, but it was only eight days. The tobacco industry's demand for tobacco leaves has always relied on the production of Shandong and Henan, but now it relies entirely on imports from abroad. Therefore, due to the insufficient supply of tobacco, the output of Chinese tobacco factories has been greatly reduced, only reaching 10% of the pre-war level. Since the establishment of the Central China Silk Association, the silk production in the occupied areas has been under unified control. Only seven factories have started operations. The prosperous situation of more than 10,000 silk looms before the war is unlikely to be seen again during the war. As for cotton mills, flour mills, and tobacco factories, they can use foreign raw materials to make up for the shortage of domestic raw materials, but the current difficulties make it difficult to achieve a sufficient supply of raw materials. This is not only due to the tight foreign exchange and the high prices of foreign raw materials but also the impact of the European War and the shortage of transport ships. For example, Shanghai's rubber industry has always relied on foreign raw materials, but due to the impact of the European War, the Malay Peninsula banned the export of rubber, forcing it to be in a state of suspension. Therefore, the raw material problem of Shanghai's industry will become even more alarming.

(2) Lack of Markets: The development of Shanghai's industry depends entirely on having good markets. Before the war, the prosperous Yangtze River basin was the main market, supplemented by North China and Central China. After the coastal areas and provinces of Central China were occupied one after another after the war, the commerce of the occupied areas had a monopoly phenomenon, resulting in Shanghai industrial products losing the good markets of the Yangtze River basin and North China. Although there was an increase in local demand and the development of Southeast Asian markets after the war, it is clear that the past prosperity was built on an unhealthy foundation. In early July, the Sino-Vietnamese traffic was cut off. At the same time, the atmosphere in Hong Kong was tense. On July 15th, the ports of Xiangshan, Wenzhou, Sandu'ao, and Fuzhou on the Zhejiang-Fujian coast were suddenly blockaded, and on the 18th, the Yunnan-Burma Road was also blockaded. The traffic between Shanghai and the interior was completely cut off. This had a very serious impact on Shanghai's industry, making the market for industrial products even narrower. This move exacerbated the industrial panic since May. Although the Yunnan-Burma Road was reopened on October 18th, the transport capacity of this road is limited and insufficient to solve the problem of product sales. Although the development of the Southeast Asian market has been quite successful since the European War, the increase in the export of Chinese manufactured goods is still limited due to competition from Japan and the United States. Therefore, in the past six months, the obstruction of freight and the lack of markets have resulted in an imbalance in production and sales. As a result, factories have had to reduce production in order to maintain operations. Although the sales problem has improved slightly since September, the market problem for products remains concerning before the aforementioned difficulties are resolved. Moreover, the Japanese are now intensifying their control, restricting or even prohibiting the import of domestic goods. Therefore, the future of Shanghai's industry is truly worrying.

(3) Speculative Monopoly: After the war, floating capital was abundant, and as a result of rampant speculation, the commodity market was completely monopolized by speculators. Speculative monopoly arbitrarily raised and lowered prices, resulting in market imbalances. Therefore, the failure of speculators in early May dealt a serious blow to the industrial sector. Taking cotton yarn as an example, the sales of local yarn actually exceeded the sales of foreign yarn by more than two times. In the three months of July, August, and September, the number of local yarn absorbed reached 140,000 bales, while foreign yarn only sold 40,000 bales. The absorption by speculators is all of a speculative nature. If the commodity market continues to be controlled by speculators, the imbalance of commodities will inevitably become even more pronounced, posing a serious threat to the future of Shanghai's industry.

Conclusion

In short, under wartime conditions, Shanghai's industry faces increasing difficulties due to the control of raw materials and the obstruction of transportation. The future is predictable. As difficulties increase, the position of Shanghai's industry will inevitably weaken. After three years of active construction, the industry in the rear has begun to take shape and is now waiting for continued development to establish the foundation of China's new industry. The government authorities should encourage the transfer of capital to the interior and the establishment of new factories, so that Shanghai capitalists and industrialists can find a bright future and avoid being caught in an adverse environment again. For existing factories in Shanghai, proactive economic measures should be taken to maintain the production capacity of national industry, rather than letting them develop or decline naturally, to accumulate the strength of the national economy.

### Current Status of China's Insurance Industry

— Mo Xinglin

The insurance business is largely divided into two types: life insurance and property insurance. However, life insurance only focuses on human life and is entirely savings-oriented, which is completely different from property insurance. Therefore, what I am referring to is property insurance (such as marine insurance, fire insurance, ship insurance, automobile insurance, etc.), and savings-oriented life insurance is not within the scope of this article.

Phenomenon of the Insurance Industry

China has had insurance companies since the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, with a history of forty or fifty years. The motivation was that China had established a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at the time, and it was believed that foreigners, in order to compete in the shipping industry, had jointly stopped underwriting the company's marine insurance (including hull, safe arrival, water damage, etc.) to exert pressure. Chinese merchants then founded "Renjihe" and several other insurance companies to counter this. Later, several of them were dissolved due to poor management. When faced with huge insurance amounts, they still could not be fully underwritten by Chinese companies; they had to reinsure with foreign merchants, earning some commission and becoming nothing more than large brokers. Up to today, forty years later, although many insurance companies have been established in the meantime, with the prices of goods rising daily, they still feel that their financial strength is weak and they cannot break away from the shackles of foreign merchant companies and operate completely independently. To date, China's investment in the insurance industry is only a little over 20 million yuan. A table is as follows:

The Need for Expansion of the Insurance Industry

According to the table listed in the previous section, the actual paid-up capital of the insurance industry, including Chinese merchant companies registered abroad, is only about 20 million yuan in total (the Central Trust Bureau Insurance Department, which is state-owned, has larger assets and scale). It is obvious that such a small amount of capital is insufficient to undertake the development of the insurance business.

Let's take fire insurance as an example: For example, a steel-concrete warehouse stores goods worth 5 million yuan; this is a very common thing, right? Then its total insured amount is already quite large. Suppose it is a steel-frame building of eight or ten stories with a construction cost of two or three million yuan, then even the interior furnishings must all be insured against fire to be assured. However, how can our insurance industry with a maximum capital of 20 million yuan accept it all? The insurance companies' insured amount, within a certain range, "or refers to a circle within four surrounding roads, or refers to a warehouse constructed entirely of steel-concrete," only accepts a proportion of 7% or 8% of the actual paid-up capital; or the company has been operating for many years and has a considerable amount of reserve funds before it can consider insuring a little more. Then their insured amount is at most just over 2 million yuan, and the remaining half or even more than half must all be directly or indirectly reinsured with foreign merchant companies. The annual insurance premiums that leak out amount to tens of millions of national currency, which are carried away by foreign merchant companies!

As for marine insurance, there are many categories and numerous types; such as hull insurance (steamships are considered immovable property, so they are different from ordinary marine insurance), safe arrival insurance, water damage insurance, and even separate dock insurance and barge insurance. If a compensation issue arises, it is even more necessary to base it on academic theory, clearly identify his responsibilities to determine how to bear them. Explaining in detail is too cumbersome. Fortunately, readers can see the rest after looking at the fire insurance situation in the previous section. But the millions of yuan in construction costs for each steamship, and the fact that each steamship can carry goods worth millions, are both very easy to see facts.

Therefore, based on the estimated insured amount that insurance companies can accept, that is, 7% to 8% to 10% of the actual paid-up capital, then the actual paid-up capital for operating insurance must reach 50 or 60 million yuan. Otherwise, it cannot be completely independent; the insured amount is even greater during times of emergency; so, excluding the existing capital of the current insurance companies, it is known that at least 30 to 40 million yuan can be increased, or even more. This may be a way to accommodate floating capital, right?

### Saturday - Bill Acceptance

Restrictions Now Exist on Time of Acceptance, Creating Various Disadvantages for Customers

Since the banking industry began closing on Saturday afternoons, it has caused inconvenience for most customers. In reality, this practice began because of a bank run on a certain Saturday last year, when they were unable to cope in time. Learning from past mistakes, they implemented Saturday afternoon closures this year. It seems that the banking sector is only considering its own convenience and seeking security, without regard for the convenience and security of its customers and other industries. This is quite unjustifiable. Unexpectedly, the bill clearing time on Saturdays has also been set by the Shanghai Bankers' Association as follows: (1) Bills from member money shops must be submitted before 11:00 AM on Saturday morning; (2) Bills from banks and trust companies outside the clearing bank must be submitted before 10:30 AM; (3) Bills from other external entities must be submitted before 10:00 AM.

Chinese banks, needing to entrust the association with collection, have further advanced the acceptance time for bills. It is rumored that some are even limiting the acceptance time to 10:00 AM, and any bills received after that will be credited on Monday's account. For example, if a customer deposits a bill from a Chinese bank or money shop into a foreign bank on Saturday, it will only be credited to the account on Monday. This situation hinders the circulation of bills, inconveniences customers, and even causes them to lose interest. Some are even forced to resort to cash transactions. For the sake of the absolute majority of bank depositors, if the banking sector cannot abolish Saturday afternoon closures, then the acceptance time for bills should be extended until noon. Banks have an obligation to accept bills on the day they are deposited during business hours (i.e., bills deposited before 12:00 PM on Saturday should be credited to the account on that day).

As for the bill clearing time among banks, since the banking industry jointly insists that Saturday afternoon closures are not for leisure but a necessary measure to prevent bank runs, the clearing can be postponed to the afternoon without being too late. It remains to be seen whether the banking sector will fulfill its duty to serve the public and accept checks during business hours to avoid causing losses to customers. (Shou)

### More Trading in Coarse White Sugar

Yesterday, the sugar market was flat, with fluctuations of only a few cents. The guild's listed price for spot coarse white sugar was 24 yuan. Foreign godown spot price was 81.30 yuan. February 10th delivery was at 81.50 yuan, which then rose to 81.60 or 81.80 yuan. February 25th delivery was at 82 yuan. February 28th delivery started at 82.20 to 82.40 yuan, but later returned to 82.20 yuan. DY brand was at 78.50 yuan, B brand old stock was at 81.60 yuan, and HM brand local stock was at 73.50 yuan. Trading in coarse white sugar was more active, with little activity in other types. Previously, the foreign godown coarse white sugar price was mistakenly reported as transit cargo; this is now corrected.

### Black Dates Remain Tight

Black dates saw some trading yesterday, and prices also rose. Top-grade Zhuang was at 120 yuan for 20 packages. Second-grade Zhuang was at 105 to 100 yuan for over 70 packages. Regular high-grade Zhuang was at 96 yuan for 55 packages. Zhu, high-grade Tongshou was at 86 yuan for 78 packages. Naxiang high-grade Zhuang was at 80 yuan for 91 packages. Additionally, 200 packages of Tongcheng black melon seeds were offered at 115 yuan. Sunflower seeds were at 63 yuan for 60 packages. Dried lily flowers remain tight. Datong vegetables were at 128 yuan for 98 bundles, 124 yuan for 10 bundles, and 120 yuan for 20 bundles. Yanghua vegetables were at 140 yuan for 20 packages. Quanxing vegetables were at 126 yuan for 108 packages.

### Hardware Spring Market Taxes Increase

The hardware market has been in good shape since the spring market opened. Due to the complete cessation of overseas supply and the cancellation of many orders by foreign firms, coupled with the limited local stock, industry insiders are optimistic and the market outlook is good. Price of goods has risen sharply. See market price for detailed list.

### Algorithm for Calculating Weekdays (Continued)

— Zheng Chaoqiang

(3) August 13, 1937 (Start date of the Second Battle of Shanghai): (13+2+37+9) ÷ 7 = 8 with a remainder of 5.

Thus, August 13th was a Friday.

Looking at the examples above, it is clear that this algorithm is accurate and convenient. Using this algorithm, we can find out the day of the week for any anniversary in this century, and we can also calculate the day of the week for our birthdays if they are in this century.

The principle of this algorithm is very simple. The month indexes listed above are easily seen to be the month indexes for 1900 used in the ordinary algorithm. Because a regular year has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day, then after a regular year, the month index of the following year should all increase by one. A leap year has one more day than a regular year, so after a leap day, the month index increases by one again. Then the index of a certain month of a certain year in this century should be the index of that month in 1900 plus the number of years from 1900 to this year, plus the number of leap days that have passed from 1900 to this month of this year. These three numbers are the three items in the formula above. If we add the number of days, then the remainder of dividing the total by seven should be the day of the week.

The above algorithm, without modification, cannot be used for other centuries, because the first year of each century, such as 1900 and 2000, does not have a leap year. Therefore, if we want to apply the above formula to other centuries, we must either change the month index or change the meaning of the remainder. For example, if we apply the above formula and month index to the 21st century, we must make the remainder of one represent Saturday, two represent Sunday, three represent Monday.... For example, January 1, 2000, was a Saturday, we must make the remainder represent Saturday, two represent Sunday, three represent Monday.... For example, January 1, 2000, was a Saturday, because (1+0+0+0) ÷ 7 has a remainder of one. This can be confirmed to be correct from the fact that New Year's Eve 1999 was a Friday. In this way, we can calculate the day of the week for any day thereafter.

When applied to the 19th century, the remainder of one represents Wednesday, two represents Thursday.... For example, November 12, 1866 (Sun Yat-sen's birthday) was a Monday, because (1213+66+16) ÷ 7 has a remainder of six.

The calendar was modified once in the 18th century. From September 14, 1752, to December 31, 1799, if the day of the week for any day is calculated according to the above formula, then the remainder of one represents Friday, two represents Saturday.... For example, July 14, 1789 (French Revolution Day) was a Tuesday, because (14+6+89+22) ÷ 7 has a remainder of five. Before September 2, 1752, every four years since the Western calendar had a leap year, that is, the first year of each century also had a leap year. Therefore, when using the above formula, the number of years should be the full number instead of the last two digits, and the number of leap days passed should be counted from the beginning of the era. The meaning of the remainder is the same as in the late 18th century, that is, the remainder of one represents Friday.... For example, May 13, 1240, was a Sunday). Because (13+1+1240+310) ÷ 7 has a remainder of three. According to the above, the day of the week for any important historical date after the Western calendar can be calculated.

At the same time, this algorithm can be used to obtain the month index for any year used in the ordinary algorithm, because the day of the week for the last day of a month is the index of the next month. For example, last December 31st was a Monday, then the index for this January is two; January 31st was a Friday, the index for February is five. Using the above formula, we can calculate the day of the week for the last day of each month this year, that is, we get the index for the next month. Now list the index for each month of this year:

Month: January February March April May June July August September October November December

Index: 2 5 5 1 3 6 1 4 0 2 5 0

Applying these indexes, we can use the remainder of the following simplified formula to find the day of the week for any day this year:

(Day + Month Index) ÷ 7

For example, this year's National Day is a Friday, because (10+2) ÷ 7 has a remainder of five.

### Rice Price Ballad

— Sun Cheng

My friend Mr. He Tao Yi is erudite, versatile, and fond of chanting. When he served as magistrate of Huangyan in the second year of the Republic, the Zhejiang Province's opium ban was strictly enforced. The county's native opium was ordered to be completely eradicated within a limited time. Therefore, he often took a sedan chair to the countryside to personally investigate. He once composed a seven-character poem on opium ban in Huangyan: "Searching for opium flowers, imperial edicts fly, a small team goes to the countryside at dawn. Baskets turn with the road, approaching the hanging stream, the valley's horn indicates the magistrate's presence. (The customs of Taizhou are fierce, but quite afraid of officials, so the county official makes a horn sound to alert them every time he goes out.) Summit welcomes, not hindering, leaning on the carriage with a nod, the market's noise is just in time for the fair. Nine sentences and a half make up the mountain's appearance, clearing poison is a labor of heart, I thank you for composing the poem." After August 13th, he came to Shanghai to take refuge, still indulging in poetry and wine. Last year, when rice reached 40 yuan per stone, he wrote a "Rice Price Ballad": "My China is a country of agriculture, producing rice year after year. If you combine nine, you often have more than three, eating your fill and enjoying a bountiful year. This year the rain and sunshine are harmonious, the harvest is sufficient for glutinous rice. Why does the price rise step by step, a peck of rice costing over ten thousand? High-priced goods aside, the fair price reaches 30 yuan. Bitter are the small-scale people, relying on hundreds of coins in hand. Hesitantly they come to the rice shop, hesitating, not daring to approach. The rice merchant glares, scolding this pittance. Looking aside, he exchanges a few coins for a pancake. Silently standing in the crowd, the constable whips him. We are refugee guests, everything can be saved, but rice is the people's heaven. At this harvest time, eating with difficulty is already pitiful, how much more in the time of scarcity, when rice is truly worrying? Many mouths criticize the monopoly, what is the reason for the high price in the producing area? Who bestowed it? Obstruction of transport and harsh taxes. Have you not heard that the rice price in Hunan and Hubei is half that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang? At the Wuhu market, boats are tied together, all carrying rice. There are native 'rice paddy fields' (local saying refers to a small amount of land rent, called rice paddy fields). Now living on this isolated island, I raise my shoulders and chant, counting the rice." Recently, the price of rice continues to rise, reaching 100 yuan per stone. Rural farmers selling rice gain a lot of money, mostly indulging in extravagance and not knowing thrift. Therefore, he wrote a "Continuation of the Rice Price Ballad" to warn them: "The rice price soars like the sun at the top of a pole, people returning from the market are unhappy. Sheltering from the war on an isolated island, the prices of a hundred items rise, making life difficult. Rice and grain account for the highest peak, ten gold coins are only enough to buy a peck. Other items are said to be several times more expensive, the price continues to rise as if chasing. Market merchants originally seek only profit, but why is there no competent bureau to stabilize? Tightening the mulberry road, levying taxes everywhere, the Benevolent Hall buries hundreds of coffins every day. Only the simple-minded, self-cultivating farmers enjoy heavenly blessings, the income from the fields increases year by year, big meat and fat fish are enjoyed to the full. A single gamble of "Yunpu" is like Liu Yi's豪, a sparrow fight of hundreds of gold coins does not cause any concern. Rent and taxes are both in arrears year after year, selling grain and returning home with gold-filled bags. Alas, what are the difficulties of the city dwellers? Market vegetables are weighed by the ounces, worth fractions of coins. The same hard work all year round, how many pecks of rice can one buy in a year? Alas! The overall situation will be clear one day, the heavens will surely restore after extreme adversity. Supply and demand have a constant balance, market price adjustment should start with rice. Farmers, farmers, take advantage of this prosperous time to be frugal and save, do not let future years bring the pain of cutting flesh to heal wounds." His earnest and sincere words are beneficial to farmers, so they are recorded in this publication for wide dissemination.

### Leiyang Prices

— Qiu Lang

My friend Mr. Zhang departed from Shanghai for Leiyang, Hunan. He traversed water and mountains, half by boat and cart, half on foot, and frequently encountered air raids, running for shelter over ten times. The places he passed were filled with broken walls and ruins, a shocking sight! After a month of detours, he finally arrived. He told me about the recent situation in Leiyang and the latest prices of goods, to give a glimpse of life there. He said, "Leiyang is the Leiyang County governed by Pang Tong in the Three Kingdoms period, about two hundred li from Hengyang. The customs of the people are still honest, and the cost of living is relatively low. The price of rice is about 25-26 yuan per stone, chicken is about 1 yuan per jin, pork and lard are 8 jiao per jin, eggs are 16 per yuan, coal produced is 5 yuan per hundred jin, and Xianglian is slightly over 1 yuan per jin. However, daily necessities are surprisingly expensive, with cigarettes costing at least 6-7 jiao per pack, matches 1 jiao per pack, and salt 1.23 yuan per jin, and not easy to buy. Silk and cloth are especially expensive. The area of Leiyang is very small, and the main business is in Hengyang. However, there are fewer air raid alarms. Although there are four or five theaters for entertainment, they all perform Xiang Opera, and people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang cannot appreciate its beauty." As the saying goes, "A mile out is not as good as home." Moreover, traveling in this extraordinary period, its hardships and difficulties are self-evident. I deeply hope that light will come and traffic will be reorganized to facilitate travel.

### How to Distinguish Silk Fabrics

— Jun Mei

How to identify fabrics? When you step into a silk fabric store, surrounded by the attentive service of the store clerks, you must make a careful choice in a short amount of time. At least you should have a simple preparation beforehand. Here, based on the author's service experience, I introduce a few relatively quick methods:

Regarding silk: Although silk fabrics are light and thin, the tightness of the warp and weft structure cannot be concealed or hidden, and can be seen at a glance. However, there are also great differences in the weight of the same silk fabric. Even with Guangkou silk, a popular silk, the difference in weight and price can be as much as ten yuan per bolt, and naturally two or three jiao per foot. Here, we must use a discerning eye to identify it. Heavier silk fabrics, such as electric spun, factory crepe, etc., are considered superior if they are smooth and shiny. Lighter silk fabrics, such as Chi Liu Sheng textile, Dian Pu, etc., are considered best if they are smooth, even, and flowing. Furthermore, silk is easily mixed with starch. If the starch is heavy, you can rub the fabric with your hand to scatter powder. If the starch is light, you can taste it with your tongue, and it will taste sweet. The silk surface will not immediately soak through after licking. As for whether the structure is tight, use your hand to pull the edge of the single-width silk fabric straight. If you find loose threads like pine flowers or a fish scale-like tear, this kind of silk surface is not durable. However, you have to distinguish a little between the weight and the cheap price.

Regarding cotton fabrics: As for identifying cotton fabrics, it is even simpler than silk. If the starch is thick and the fabric is thin, you can see when looking at it against the light that the fabric eyes between the warp and weft are completely covered by the starch, and the fabric surface is also relatively hard and has a special luster. To test the firmness of the fabric, you can hold one end of the fabric and first pull its transverse surface, then pull its longitudinal surface. It is best if it remains as it was originally after pulling, with no lengthening or skewing. For dyed fabrics, if you rub the fabric surface back and forth quickly with a white handkerchief and find that the handkerchief has color and the fabric surface has a halo, then the fabric is heavily starched and the color material is inferior. When the warp and weft yarns are broken, the fabric is inferior if it is hairy and loose, and it is durable if it is smooth and firm. There is also a kind of linen fabric, between silk and cotton, that feels smooth and firm when you rub it with your hand, and has many wrinkles after being crumpled. This is something that fabric buyers must pay attention to.

In addition, I don't know about woolen fabrics, serge, etc., so I dare not make any conjectures. I'll leave it to those with experience in this field to introduce them.

### A Week's Regular Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

The Spring Festival is a season of feasting in the year. After eating the New Year's Eve dinner, followed by the New Year's wine, in addition to your own home, you also have to visit relatives and friends' homes, and everywhere you are always munching. For a while, fish, meat, chicken, and duck are eaten so greasy that even the appetite is ruined these days. In order to regulate the taste, I advise you to eat more vegetables and other light things during this week. Fortunately, the prices of vegetables are also particularly cheap these days. Rape and cabbage cost only five cents per jin, and chives cost only three cents per bunch. Not only are they cheap, but they are also crispy and delicious when cooked with more oil, so you really can't not eat them. If there are people who cannot eat without meat, and feel uncomfortable eating vegetarian food, then you may want to stir-fry shrimp with rape, or stir-fry shredded pork with chives, which is also a small amount of meat. In addition, stir-fried silver mustard greens, pickled soybean sprouts, shrimp and seaweed salad, and sesame oil spicy Chinese cabbage are also precious things to regulate the taste after eating a lot of greasy food.

Monday: Stir-fried garlic sprouts with shredded pork, stewed yellow croaker with snow vegetables, stir-fried cabbage, shrimp and seaweed salad

Tuesday: Celery with shredded beef, clam crucian carp soup, vegetarian ten scenes, dried tofu with mung bean sprouts

Wednesday: Stir-fried chives with shredded pork, shrimp and egg drop soup, stir-fried silver mustard greens, spinach with tofu

Thursday: Sweet potato with shredded beef, vermicelli bighead carp head, stir-fried rape with thread noodles, sesame sauce with water celery

Friday: Stir-fried cauliflower with sliced pork, sweet and sour yellow croaker, braised potato slices, pickled soybean sprouts

Saturday: Stir-fried onion with shredded beef, stir-fried rape with shrimp, braised cabbage, jellyfish potato shreds

Sunday: Stir-fried chicken giblets, fried hairtail, alfalfa, spicy cabbage

Matters of health and small ambitions – Tangerine, Zhang Jingren

The tangerine tree is about ten feet tall, with many thorns on its branches. Its leaves have pointed ends, are green and glossy, over an inch wide and about two inches long. Small white flowers bloom on the fourth day, and are very fragrant. The fruit sets and turns yellow in winter, the larger ones are like cups, with segments inside, each segment containing a seed, tasting slightly sweet and sour, with a yellowish-red color. Those with coarse and thick skin, much juice and sweetness, are commonly known as honey tangerines. Those produced in Fujian are red in color, and are called Fujian tangerines. The peel and reticulum can both be used in medicine. Similarly, Huazhou has tangerine trees in the government office, and its red tangerine peel is boiled into a soup to drink, and phlegm is immediately relieved. In the Qing Dynasty, it was a tribute item to be wrapped in reed mats, so it was not easy for the common people to obtain. The "Huazhou tangerine red" sold in pharmacies is mostly counterfeit. According to the "Classic of Materia Medica," tangerine peel can regulate qi, resolve phlegm, dry dampness, and move stagnation; the reticulum treats wei qi, treats reverse flow of qi from the lung meridians, unblocks stagnant qi in the meridians, and drives out accumulated phlegm outside the skin. In recent times, Westerners have refined its juice into medicinal tablets called Vitamin C, taking its effect of promoting salivation and digestion. Therefore, people overindulge in it for its nourishing power, but they do not know that its taste is slightly sour, and it can also cause phlegm. There are many myths about tangerines, such as in the "Record of the Supernatural and Strange": In Ba Yin's tangerine garden, after the frost, tangerines like jars were seen, and when opened, there were two old men playing chess, saying: "The joy in the tangerine is slightly less than that of Mount Shang." In the "Biographies of Immortals": Su Xian Gong told his mother: "I am destined to become an immortal. Next year there will be a plague in the world, and a liter of well water with a tangerine leaf can cure one person." The following year, there was indeed a plague, and his mother was asked to treat it, and no one was not cured. Therefore, later generations named Xiangqi (Chinese chess) "Tangerine Game," and called medical skills "Tangerine and Heaven." The ancients said that tangerines have virtue, so Qu Yuan used them as a metaphor for himself. Emperor Wu of Han set up a tangerine official in Jiaozhi, with a rank of 200 dan, in charge of tribute tangerines, which was considered extravagant by commentators. However, today the Siamese honey tangerines are sold at extremely high prices, and there are still many who eat them, do they have the same taste as the ancients?

Spring and Autumn

### Again

— Shuying

Prices are up again, taxes are increased again, again… Poor people worry when they hear "again"!

Another new dance hall opens, another "earthly paradise" appears, again… Rich people are naturally overjoyed when they hear "again".

The saying goes, "Blessings never come in pairs, misfortunes never come singly." But now, the poor people's "misfortunes" certainly do not come "singly"; the rich people's "blessings" happen to come "in pairs". No wonder the poor hate "again"; the rich sing praises to "again".

Originally, someone could come out to intervene with "again", to make it "one and not again, again and become one"; but now they are controlled by the money behind "again", and are reluctant to take "direct action"...

In this way, it is not until "again" is really out of hand that they come out with a stern face to "educate" them. The rich naturally respond with a cold smile; the poor have only three words: "Again"!

Another year has passed, and the future is long. Please, the gentlemen who manage "again", "examine yourselves three times a day", do not "again" allow a little money to keep the poor citizens in a state of perpetual sorrow, this is what is hoped for!

### People Who Wrestle With Numbers

— Zhong Zimang

A "Spring Festival" Permeated with the Anesthetic Air of Monte Carlo

Spring Festival—is a season for gambling.

During Spring Festival, people are in the vortex of dice and roulette, spinning, turning, floating and sinking!

Street dice jump in celadon bowls. The "stall owner" wearing a round felt hat murmurs: "Open the bet! Gold ingots roll in! Ah-ya, one five makes a pair, one pays three..." This kind of "gambling song" accompanies the dynamics of dice and banknotes, singing, surrounded by some rough men, so there are rough shouts, and some local ruffians, smoking inferior cigarettes, look around to keep watch." Sometimes the police come and disperse the stalls, but they gather again afterwards...

There, is a car repair shop, which has been closed for the Spring Festival. Several apprentices are sitting on the ground playing poker, with tattered banknotes placed in front of each. Before long, they are arguing, throwing "Old K" and "rotten egg" at each other, and the fractional currency is almost blown into the gutter by the wind. …

This is an alley, and the sound of shuffling cards is heard. That set of ivory mahjong tiles—more than three hundred—floats on the white tablecloth. These ladies and grandmothers usually use this to pass the time. It should be even more lively during the New Year. Ten yuan as the base and sixteen rounds, playing from after lunch until midnight. The men haven't come back either, the big ones have gone to play in rooms, don't follow that vixen...

Hmm, it is this beehive-like building, immersed from morning to night in the rich light of hundreds of cream-colored light bulbs. The waiters are very busy, shuttling through each room. The accountant answers the phone:

"...Sorry, no rooms available...They were all booked early last year!"

In the room, the radiator is boiling. The dealer is piling up stacks of banknotes and coins. The people next to him surround him. One person anxiously picks up a pair of ivory tiles. The eyes of the people on this side are widened: "Heavenly King!" with joy; but the dealer's luck is very "red", it is a pair of "man tiles". Before the joyful nerves have recovered, there is another wave of depressed and slight cursing.

"Old Zhang, the gambling is not exciting enough, let's go to the '× Country Hotel'."

The car wheels are spinning, and countless trees recede behind. The "Hotel" parking lot is crowded with black-license plates.

Inside: It's a heat wave. The big glass tables are surrounded by people bursting with blue veins, sweat dripping from their foreheads to their chins; the men in suits have taken off their coats and vests, and their ties are crooked; the men in Chinese clothes have taken off their coats and vests, and their buttons are loose; the place to buy chips looks like a play: buying two hundred, five hundred, one thousand, five thousand, signing checks: ten thousand yuan, fifty thousand yuan, one hundred thousand yuan; sit down, a fragrant hot towel comes, hot green tea comes, are you hungry? That cherry-lipped and charming girl guides you to the dining room.

The numbers on the roulette wheel, to whom will this large pile of banknotes belong, waiting for your judgment...

The elderly and a group of elegant literati like to hum and harmonize. If there is no poetry when gambling for money, it is considered "spoiling the fun", so there is the game of "guessing poetry riddles". Gathered under the electric light, stacking poetry strips, like "Willow Catkins fluttering in the wind", is it guessing "Goose", guessing "Swallow", guessing "Butterfly", guessing "Crow", guessing "Oriole"? Shaking heads, guess "Swallow"! Drop ten yuan, but the answer turns out to be "Goose". The dealer takes out an ancient book to verify, smiling...

In the dance hall, before stepping into this magical cave of changing lights, some people are attracted by the slot machine in front of the door. Although, there are prohibitions, but this "tiger" is still sticking out its tongue in this dark corner. People put in coins, bananas...lemons...oranges...apples flicker in the glass strip, blurring their vision...

The Spring Festival in Shanghai has the anesthetic air of Monte Carlo!

### Firecrackers

— Shui Rong

Ping! Pang!

Suddenly, breaking through the silence of midnight, came two such sudden sounds. Almost at the same time, sparks illuminated the dim night sky.

Ping! Pang!

One just died out, and another bloomed with brilliant flowers. That sound, that light, is like thunder, like lightning. Although it is only a moment, it is so precious to this blind and mute world!

I silently looked into the distance, listening. I also heard my heart beating, and saw my blood flowing.

At this time, something roared again somewhere: crackle, crackle, crackle!… I regret that I cannot see the raging fire. But it's better not to see it, anyway, from that constant rapid sound, I can better understand the igniter's hope for the future and desire for new life.

The next day, I finally went to buy some firecrackers.

For firecrackers, I seem to particularly like the small ones. Look: These little guys, tied together, look so dull! When I hang them on the pole, light a match, and ignite one of them, they are no longer so weak and docile. Like a crowd of angry people, the environment forces them to suppress the heaviness in their hearts, and fully express their hatred and revenge for their experiences. Look at them: struggling, agitated, fighting! When each of them is alone, they will only flash a spark, shake once, and emit a puff of smoke. But now, they are more like a machine gun!

The smell of gunpowder that I haven't smelled for a long time, at that time, drilled into my nostrils again. My eyes were dazzled by the gunpowder smoke. I seemed to be standing on the street again, hundreds of cars driving past me, and those cars emitted such a gunpowder smell, mixed with joyful shouts. That made me jump for three days!…

The sound of the firecrackers gradually became fragmented. On the ground was a pile of embers still smoking. I finally set off firecrackers for a whole morning with definite optimism and joy. Of course, my mood still has some "reservations", reserved for the "festival" in the near future!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

What could the waiters in restaurants or inns not know about all the secretive and shameless deeds in the world? As soon as Begonia entered the elegant seat left by Granny Wang, the two waiters both exited, although one of them had cast a wicked glance at the hostess, who was dressed in glittering jewels.

"Yo! Boss Wu, why aren't you wearing a hat in such cold weather?" Granny Wang stared at Begonia charmingly, and the strong fragrance of cosmetics rushed straight into the other person's senses.

Although this was not what Begonia had expected, seeing the situation, he understood.

"Why don't I see Seventh Master?" He wanted to turn around and ask Rong Kui, but this follow-up gentleman who had retired successfully had already disappeared without a trace; he couldn't help but blush and immediately wanted to back out.

But how could Boss Wang's wife let him leave?

"Let me take off your cloak for you!" She walked briskly to Begonia's side and stretched out a pair of pink hands—a pair of hands that had never done anything beneficial to anyone—really wanting to take off his fur cloak.

Wang's white face, bright red lips, coupled with a magnetic smile and such gentle speech, almost melted this young artist in his twenties.

His face flushed, completely losing his power of resistance.

"Things must rot from within before worms infest them... If you want others to respect you, you must respect yourself first..." Liangyou's loyal words suddenly rang in his ears again, making him feel a lot more sober in his mind.

Over the years, he has actually been tempted by the outside world a lot, but this is the first time he has encountered such a close-quarters situation; his own reason obviously cannot control him, but fortunately Yuan Shaowen's constant advice is able to wake him up at critical moments. (20)

— Most Despicable

— Juehui

There are three types of evil people:

The first type is blatant, appearing in public, and is evil in a straightforward manner; the second type is secretive, sneaky, and evil in a somewhat sinister way; the third type is a "human" during the day and a "demon" at night. They say "Amitabha" to people, but do all kinds of evil behind their backs; only this third type, and only this third type, is the most despicable!

How can it be seen?

Evil on the outside can be dealt with; evil on the inside can be guarded against; only this "dagger in the smile," this "good person" wearing a mask, deceives people without them knowing, makes them suffer without them knowing…They know nothing!

The so-called "highly respected," "meritorious," "compassionate,"… seem to be "nothing to say"; in fact, they are hoarding and speculating, extorting and defrauding, doing everything; yet people often consider them "good people."

These people are truly the most despicable!
