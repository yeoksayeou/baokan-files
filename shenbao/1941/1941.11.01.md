### The China Problem Difficult to Resolve; US-Japan Talks Stalled; Rumor Japan Has Given Up Hope of Reaching Agreement; Toho Newspaper Urges Japanese Cabinet to Negotiate with Soviets

Reuters, Washington, 31st

The continuing tension in US-Japan relations has not yet reached an extreme; it can still be said to be in a state of stagnation. The Japanese government seems to hold little hope of reaching any large-scale compromise with the United States. However, there is no indication from Tokyo that it is prepared to take any action in the event of the failure of US-Japan talks. The talks have not been interrupted, but their progress is like a snail's pace. The New York Times quoted a Japanese spokesperson in Washington as saying that the Japanese government has almost given up hope of reaching a complete agreement with the United States on the Pacific issue, because the US government insists that any permanent solution to the Pacific issue must involve the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China. Observers here who have close contact with Far Eastern affairs have long expected this important clause. Therefore, the talk of a broad agreement between the US and Japanese governments, which was widely touted in many quarters a few weeks ago, is not worth mentioning. The New York Times also quoted the Japanese spokesperson as saying, "During these talks, there will be some proposals and answers from both sides, but the differences are too great to inspire hope for an early resolution." This spokesperson has confirmed the state of affairs that American observers here have been aware of for weeks. The New York Times says that the general opinion in Washington today is that there is no chance of a general solution, and there is little hope of lifting the oil embargo. The State Department may be preparing to find a way to transport oil from the Dutch East Indies to Japan in exchange for Japan's guarantee not to continue aggressive actions in the South Pacific or Siberia. However, this plan may not be successful.

Future Dangerous Situation; Initiative Remains with Japan

It is almost an open secret today that the United States initially expected that conflict would be almost unavoidable after Tojo took office. Therefore, rumors that Tojo was preparing his troops for war were rampant here at the time. However, it is now known that the situation today is not like that. People here generally believe that Tojo is acting cautiously. The reasons for this are twofold: first, Hitler's failure to capture Moscow or crush the Soviet Union's resistance; and second, advancing into Siberia would inevitably lead to open conflict between Japan and Britain, and even the United States. According to information obtained from here, Japan is still taking various preliminary actions, such as mobilizing 120 divisions in preparation for launching an attack and continuously transporting equipment and supplies. However, there will be no new actions until Moscow is lost. Japan's attempt to reach a compromise with the United States and seek to maintain the status quo of trade is making little progress. The Japanese side has realized that Washington will not abandon many basic points. Since Tojo came to power, US Undersecretary of State Welles has only met with Japanese representatives once. The speed of these US-Japan talks can be inferred from this. According to newspaper reports, while the Japanese admitted that a dangerous situation might arise after the Japanese parliament convenes on November 15, the US-Japan talks have not seen much progress. The Japanese side has not explained where the so-called dangerous situation lies. The reason why Japan has submitted a letter of pleading to the US government, setting a deadline for the US-Japan talks to make progress before November 15, stems from this. In fact, it is Japan, not the United States, that feels the situation is becoming more and more difficult. The embargo is now hitting Japan hard. For this reason, future action remains with Japan. Some people here predict that unless the Japanese parliament remains completely silent, Tojo will face the difficulty of explaining why US-Japan relations have fallen into this dangerous state, what measures he is currently taking, and what he intends to do in the future.

Rumor Japanese Cabinet Has Agreed to First Attack the Burma Road

United Press, London, 31st. Yesterday, information obtained here from sources regarded as reliable claimed that Japan is preparing to launch a strong attack on China before venturing to invade the South. The information claimed that the Japanese cabinet has agreed to first attack the Burma Road, and then make plans to attack Chongqing, in order to make every effort to end the Sino-Japanese war. This news is difficult to confirm here, but they firmly believe that the Japanese army in Manchuria has increased to 35 or 40 divisions.

United Press, Chongqing, 31st. China's army newspaper stated today that the Japanese army has increased its concentration of troops in Shanxi, Henan, and northern Vietnam in preparation for launching a huge pincer attack on Chongqing from both the north and south, and cutting off the Yunnan-Burma Road. The newspaper called on Britain and the United States to take immediate action against Japan, because in order to defeat Hitler, Japan must first be resolved. The newspaper stated that the sole purpose of the British evacuation order is to resolve Japan militarily. China is fighting against the East Asian New Order and the so-called Co-Prosperity Sphere. We hope that Britain and the United States, in addition to understanding this point, will immediately take military action in the same direction.

United Press, Tokyo, 31st. The Japan Times today criticized in an editorial the United States' demand to China for the transfer of base areas as compensation for US lend-lease aid to China, and the fact that Chongqing has accepted this in principle. The editorial stated that this transfer of mortgage includes the United States' extensive rights to maintain and utilize undetermined naval bases in China after the establishment of world peace, or as a condition of world peace. (This editorial is clearly based on recent news from Washington that the United States has requested Britain to guarantee the United States' right to utilize British bases around the world, and that the United States has simultaneously proposed to China and Britain a post-war economic reconstruction program.) The newspaper said that Major General Magruder, head of the US military mission to China, asked General Chiang Kai-shek to accept this agreement. The editorial stated that Japan refuses the sinister control scheme, which is currently exerting greater pressure on this country and the Far East. It is now apparent that the lend-lease aid to China is all about expanding the affluent United States. In another editorial, the newspaper stated that "American peace can be achieved through tolerance and concessions to show a more active weakness" to strive for world peace. It also stated that Japan is the only non-belligerent nation with the power to invoke the peace policies initiated by the United States in the most favorable circumstances everywhere in the world. The United States has never shown any preparation to strive for peace in the Pacific. However, any constructive suggestion cannot be considered a sign of weakness. The United States must understand this meaning, and it is not too late now.

United Press, Tokyo, 31st. The Kokumin Shimbun urged Tojo not to miss the opportunity to negotiate unresolved issues with the Soviet Union, so that it can use neutrality with fairness and integrity. The newspaper stated that the Soviet Union should cease its aid to China. It also stated that the Soviet Union is currently about to lose its capital, and the war clouds in the Pacific are increasing. Japan's relationship with the Soviet Union can no longer remain uncertain.

### Australian Prime Minister Curtin Declares Resolution to Resist Any Aggression; New Zealand People Also Prepared to Defend the Country; British Representative Duff Cooper Scheduled to Arrive in Australia on the 5th

Reuters, Canberra, 31st. Prime Minister Curtin recently spoke in response to German Admiral Raeder's recent suggestion to Japan that Australia is easily invaded, saying that he dares to assert that Japan is far more familiar with the situation than Raeder. His intention is only to try to induce Japan to fight for Germany. A year ago, the Germans propagated that Britain was easy to invade, but now they know better. Australia wishes to see a calm Pacific without any waves, but is determined to resist any aggression, and is fully prepared for this. For two years, Australia has believed that it cannot escape the threat of the enemy, so it has acted on this belief. It is not just Australia that is acting.

Reuters, Wellington, 31st. New Zealand Minister of Labour Webb recently gave a speech to workers at the Auckland naval base, saying that Germany's recent urging of Japan to join the Axis powers in attacking Australia may also be applied to New Zealand. He believes that Japan knows that attacking Australia and New Zealand will not be easy, and expresses doubt that Japan will heed Germany's persuasion, saying that if Japan does heed it, every citizen of New Zealand will do their utmost.

Reuters, Singapore, 31st. Duff Cooper will depart for Australia in the next few days. Before Cooper's arrival, former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Keswick, will soon travel to London via the United States. It is widely believed that Keswick's trip is to bring Cooper's preliminary report on the Far East investigation back to the British Cabinet.

Reuters, Canberra, 31st. Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced that Duff Cooper, the British Cabinet's special representative to the Far East, will attend next week's meeting of the Australian War Council, and will confer with defense and defense adjustment officials, and will also inspect various military stations and munitions factories. Cooper and his wife and entourage are scheduled to arrive in Australia from Singapore on November 5 and will visit Sydney, Melbourne, and Canberra.

United Press, Manila, 31st. Major General Grunert, commander of the US Army's Philippine Division, has departed for San Francisco aboard a US Army transport ship to report to President Roosevelt. It is widely believed that Lieutenant General MacArthur, commander of the US Far East Command, will concurrently serve as commander of the Philippine Division. Furthermore, Lieutenant Colonel Brereton and Colonel Rockewell will arrive in Cavite on Sunday aboard the Clipper, due to the Clipper's delay in Wake Island. Brereton will serve as commander of the US Far East Air Force, while Rockewell will serve as commander of the 16th Naval District, replacing Rear Admiral Pymus.

### US Army Ordered to Take Over Airplane Factory; President Roosevelt Issues Proclamation; Defense Production Must Not Be Interrupted

United Press, Washington, 31st. President Roosevelt last night ordered the Army Department to take over the strike-bound airplane factory of the Aviation Allied Factory in Bendix, New Jersey, so that the production of $5 million worth of military aircraft equipment would not be interrupted by the strike. The President issued this order in the name of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy. In this order, the President directly condemned the company for its dispute with the Aircraft Workers Department of the United Automobile Workers Union, and criticized the company for failing to comply with the National Defense Mediation Board's recommendation that all striking workers should be reinstated. In the order, the President has ordered Secretary of War Stimson to exercise any contractual or other authority on behalf of the company, and to take all measures to ensure production, and if necessary, to use the army. The President also issued a formal proclamation explaining the facts and commenting on the company's mismanagement. He concluded that this step was taken because "our country is currently in extreme danger" and it was necessary to do so. The statement said, "The items produced by the factory are the most critical part of our country's defense. Therefore, I have ordered all workers in the factory to cooperate with the Army Department to ensure a speedy resumption of work." The War Department also announced that Colonel Stimson has ordered Colonel Jones, an Air Corps officer who was on the scene, to preside over the factory, assisted by two majors. Stimson said that he may send troops to the factory to help maintain order. The President's order also stated that the termination date of the government's possession and operation of the factory will be determined by the President himself. When the President believes that this possession and operation are no longer necessary for the national defense interest, it will be terminated.

### US Army Creates Mountain Warfare Unit

United Press, Washington, 31st. Secretary of War Stimson announced yesterday that the US Army is creating special units for mountain warfare, because this type of unit has been successful in the European war. He declined to comment on reports that former Export Control Administrator Maxwell will lead an American delegation to the Near East to develop transportation facilities from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea.

### Another US Ship Sunk by Torpedo; While Escorting in the Atlantic

Reuters, Washington, 31st. The Navy Department recently issued the following statement: The destroyer "Reuben James" was torpedoed and sunk on the night of October 30 while escorting in the Atlantic Ocean west of Iceland. The captain is Lieutenant Commander Edward. No further details have been received yet, but they will be released as soon as they are received. The ship is 314 feet long, 30 feet wide, and has a displacement of 1,190 tons. It usually has 114 sailors and 6 officers. According to the Navy Department, the ship is of the O-type or flush-deck type, similar to those transferred to Britain.

### Britain Watches Japanese Movements; Believes Far Eastern Situation is Serious

Reuters, London, 31st. This morning, all newspapers prominently published Tojo's speech yesterday and the news from Shanghai that the British Embassy had issued a notice warning Britons to evacuate as soon as possible. An editorial in the "News Chronicle" said that although the barometer of the Far Eastern crisis fluctuates, on the whole, the trend is clearly deteriorating. The newspaper concluded that Japan's military and economic problems have become so serious that its only hope of extricating itself lies in the victory of the Axis powers. Therefore, Japan may soon move forward suddenly. The "Daily Mail" also wrote that although Tojo used resolute rhetoric to intimidate the United States and the British Commonwealth, it is very clear that he will not be able to coerce the United States into compromising with him so that he can dominate the Far East. A diplomatic correspondent for the "Manchester Guardian" said that Tojo is eager to consolidate the domestic front to cope with future events. However, it is also very clear that Japanese leaders hope that their war of nerves will help achieve their goals and induce the United States to make concessions. Judging from the situation, Japan seems to have tried to persuade the United States to abandon aid to China in the talks in Washington. However, the firm attitude of the United States has been clearly expressed in these negotiations for the second time. Judging from the measures taken by the Japanese government, it can be seen that Japan is gradually moving towards a state of preparation in economic, political, and military terms. There is currently no immediate sign of an attack on the Soviet Union, but there are many facts that can prove that Japan will prepare to attack the Soviet Union from behind in the event that the Soviet Union collapses. The newspaper concluded that Japan's agreement with Portugal to use Timor as the starting and ending point for air routes can be seen as a sign that those who advocate naval warfare have temporarily gained a slight advantage in Tokyo.

### Fierce Battle Occurs North of Qixian; Japanese Troops in Northern Henan Attacked by Chinese Forces; Chinese Troops Rush into Gaocun Station and Destroy Japanese Locomotives; Important Stronghold of Qigang South of Zhongmu Captured

Chongqing Military News. (1) On the evening of the 26th, a certain unit of the Chinese army in northern Henan attacked Gaocun Station north of Hongxian. While engaged in combat with the Japanese, a Japanese armored train rushed to the station to reinforce them, firing fiercely with artillery. The Chinese troops moved south of the station, encircling a part of the Japanese forces. Subsequently, the Japanese from Qixian and Miaokou also rushed to reinforce them by different routes. After the Chinese troops divided their forces to intercept them, they were repelled. The Chinese then won the victory and returned. In this battle, the Chinese also destroyed two Japanese bunkers, destroyed one Japanese locomotive, four carriages, and dozens of sections of railway tracks. (2) The Japanese who retreated to Shizishan Changshandong were fiercely attacked by the Chinese pursuit troops. By noon on the 26th, they retreated to Chaoyang in defeat. (3) At 9:00 AM on the 27th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese in Dianqian Street northwest of Nanchang. The Japanese stationed in Niuhang, upon hearing the alarm, rushed to reinforce them, but were ambushed by Chinese troops near Meiling. After two hours of fierce fighting, many Japanese officers and soldiers, including apprentice officer Hyakubishio, were killed or wounded, and many were captured alive. Many light machine guns and rifles were also seized. (31st dispatch)

Luoyang On the evening of the 21st, at 6:00 PM, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Hongxian Station and Miaokou to the northwest, killing many Japanese and destroying many railway tracks and barbed wire. (29th dispatch)

Luoyang On the afternoon of the 17th, at 4:00 PM, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Qigang southwest of Zhongmu, capturing the area and killing or wounding many Japanese. (29th dispatch)

Chongqing A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission reviewed the war situation of the past week, saying that judging from the Japanese army's attack on the east bank of the Yellow River from Hejin by more than 10,000 troops, and the concentration of Japanese troops increasing in northern Vietnam, it suggests that the Japanese army is currently making pincer movements from the north and south. The Japanese army's offensive in western Shanxi has been blocked by the Chinese side, while the Japanese army's actions in northern Vietnam have continued unabated. On other fronts in China in the past week, there were only small-scale battles in central Hubei and Henan. At the same time, according to telecommunications from the Tongguan battlefield, on October 29, there was fierce fighting all day in Longmen, east of the Yellow River in Jin territory. The Japanese army attempted to gain a stronghold there. As a result of the battle, there were no changes in the positions of either side. (31st Reuters dispatch)

### Daily Necessities Warehouses to be Established Throughout Free Areas

Chongqing The Ta Kung Pao stated today that the Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently planning to establish warehouses throughout the free areas to store daily necessities in order to prevent price increases. These warehouses will only store daily necessities, excluding food and salt. (31st Reuters dispatch)

### Talk of Abolishing the One-Party System is Tantamount to Sabotaging Resistance and National Reconstruction; Shameless Politicians Loudly Advocating Absurd Theories in Hong Kong; Chongqing's Saodang Pao Publishes Article Criticizing It

Chongqing The Saodang Pao stated today that currently, shameless politicians are loudly advocating the abolition of the one-party system in Hong Kong and other places. In fact, the Kuomintang is not working for the interests of one party, but serving the interests of the entire country, on the one hand leading China's struggle for freedom and independence, and on the other hand establishing a democratic republic. The national government is produced by the party, and only by supporting the national government can China's victory in resistance and national reconstruction be achieved. Japan not only wants to overthrow the national government, but also wants to overthrow the Kuomintang. From this, it can be seen that the sovereignty of China, the political power, and the party rule are inseparable. The existence of the Kuomintang is the existence of the Republic of China. At the current critical moment, opposition to the one-party system will undermine China's resistance and national reconstruction. Those who launch it are no different from the Fifth Column, and the result will be a repeat of the French tragedy in China. (31st Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing Neither official nor private sectors here have paid much attention to the Democratic Political League organized by some people in Hong Kong. In addition to an informal "unheard of" statement in response to the league's declaration that it was "established in Chongqing", the official side has not made any other statements. Privately, it has not been used as a topic of conversation to date. Only the Saodang Bao, the official newspaper of the Political Department, has published an article warning against the tragedy of France. The newspaper reiterated this matter today, stating, "Recently, there have been a very small number of deserters from the fighting camp in Hong Kong who are advocating so-called united party organizations and so-called political alliances. They are reversing black and white and recklessly slandering the party rule that is unanimously supported by the entire country today." It also said, "Under the supreme principle of one-party rule, if there are organizations and activities that violate this principle, the result will inevitably be to disperse the fighting forces, hinder the central government, and affect the sovereignty of the country. No matter what their motives are, in fact, they are no different from carrying out the mission of the Fifth Column for the enemy. Those who support and participate in such organizations and activities, if they do not jointly plan national affairs in the existing public opinion organs (referring to the National Political Council), but just enjoy themselves overseas and talk idly, that is not only contrary to the spirit of democracy, but also undermining the establishment of the democratic politics of the Three People's Principles."

### Situation After the Catastrophe in Changle Street

Changle Street A reporter recently traveled up the Miluo River from Miluo and arrived at Changle Street, which was recovered by Dong Yu's troops, for an inspection. The hanging bridge erected by the Japanese there has not yet been destroyed. The bridge deck is very low, only suitable for use when the water level of the Miluo River drops. It has a load capacity of 10 tons and is wide enough for cars to travel side by side. The highway that the Japanese repaired from Xiqiang Changhu Dajing Street crosses the river here, and then goes south through Lixiang Mafengzui, and then turns east to Jiangjiaqiao Jinjing. Although the construction of this road is very simple, the construction of the bridge seems to have been prepared in advance. According to eyewitnesses from the local natives, from the 23rd of last month to the 5th of this month, at least more than 500 armored cars and tanks passed through this bridge. These cars were mostly manufactured by the American Ford Company. The Japanese cars carried military supplies when going south, and half carried soldiers and corpses and half carried grain, rice, and clothing when going north. Many sweet potatoes near Changle Street were also taken away by them. At 4:00 PM on the 6th of this month, a part of the Japanese army that had been defeated and retreated from Changsha set fire when retreating through the northern part of Changle Street. Dong Yu's division, a unit of the Chinese intercepting troops, extinguished it and destroyed a part of the bridge to cut off their retreat. Seeing the critical situation, a Japanese plane landed on the beach by the river in Changle Street to carry its commander to break through and escape to the north. The remaining Japanese soldiers fled on foot in all directions. Changle Street is a famous township in the middle section of the Miluo River. After suffering this catastrophe, it has lost all its vitality. Now, the citizens have returned one after another and are building a new Changle Street in the ruins. (25th dispatch)

### Anti-Malaria Work on Yunnan-Burma Road Actively Underway

### Chongqing Social Bureau Handles Cigarette Registration

Chongqing: The Chongqing Municipal Social Bureau recently issued a notice to handle cigarette registration. All non-merchant businessmen and non-businessmen must register the quantity of cigarettes in their possession with the Social Bureau before November 15th. Businessmen in the trade should register with the trade association. Those who exceed the deadline will have their cigarettes confiscated. The notice also mentioned the recent surge in cigarette prices, which has stimulated general commodity prices and had a significant impact. According to reports, the target of hoarding and speculation is very broad, mainly focusing on food, cotton yarn, and cigarettes. Food is purely a daily necessity, and the government has repeatedly taken measures to crack down and control it. However, stability in food prices still awaits the government's implementation of in-kind collection of land taxes and fixed-price purchases. Hoarders then shift their capital to cigarettes. In the past few months, the price of "Great Britain" brand cigarettes, at 50,000 cigarettes per carton, fluctuated between 7,000 and 8,000 yuan. Disrupted by these people, the price soared to 20,000 yuan per carton in a few days. Initially, the government considered this item not a necessity and did not intervene. However, as a result, it stimulated other commodity prices, and the economic police were dispatched, seizing 2,000 cartons in one fell swoop. Thorough handling would involve a wide range of people. Hoarders were thus somewhat alarmed, and the price of cigarettes also dropped by 3,000 yuan. (Havas News Agency, 31st)

### Hong Kong Government Forms Committee to Investigate Corruption Cases

### Chongqing's Exported Goods Increase, Tung Oil is the Most, Accounting for More Than 70,000 Piculs, Pig Bristles are Transported to Hong Kong by Airplane

Chongqing: According to statistics from the Commodity Inspection Bureau, the goods exported from Chongqing to foreign countries in the first nine months of this year, except for sheepskin and deerskin, have increased compared to the same period last year. Among the exported goods, tung oil ranks first, accounting for 78,159 piculs, an increase of 14,234 piculs compared to last year. Pig bristles rank second, accounting for 7,084 piculs, an increase of 1,687 piculs. Raw silk accounted for 1,861 piculs, an increase of 1,219 piculs. Tung oil and raw silk are transported through Burma, pig bristles through Hong Kong, and then exported to other countries. Furthermore, a portion of the pig bristles is transported to Hong Kong by airplane, which also shows its high value. (Havas News Agency, 30th)

### Chongqing Banning Gambling

Chongqing: It was learned today that Chongqing is strictly prohibiting mahjong and other forms of gambling. In the past two weeks, the police have arrested 600 to 700 people who violated the ban. Ordinary citizens are subject to fines at various levels, but government and bank employees are subject to more severe penalties. It is reported that several people have been sentenced to six months of hard labor. Perhaps because a certain police station was fully focused on the gambling ban, it suddenly discovered yesterday that its weekly food allowance had been stolen by thieves. (United Press, 31st)

### Serious U.S.-German Relations, New York Democratic Representative Proposes Severing Diplomatic Relations with Germany, Armed Merchant Ship Bill Will Eventually Pass the Senate

United Press, 31st, Berlin: The indications gradually increased here yesterday, showing that President Roosevelt's Navy Day speech finally convinced the Germans that U.S. entry into the war was only a matter of time. Ordinary Germans whom reporters contacted for business or social reasons in the past 48 hours urgently inquired about their views on the meaning of the speech. They repeatedly asked when the United States would enter the war. Observers believe that the severity and swiftness of the German officialdom's response to the speech indicate the seriousness of U.S.-German relations.

United Press, 31st, Washington: New York Democratic Representative Siler proposed in the House of Representatives yesterday, sincerely requesting President Roosevelt to sever diplomatic relations with Germany.

United Press, 31st, Washington: The debate in the Senate over the armed merchant ship bill became more intense yesterday, but private opposition sources stated that they could not gain additional support, so they believed that the Senate would pass the amendment. Utah Democratic Senator Thomas defended the amendment, saying that the Senate's refusal to grant President Wilson's request to arm merchant ships in 1917 was a "mistake," as the United States was thereby drawn into the war. He also said, "The war came about purely due to small events. Hitler is now threatening the world as a tyrant, just like the dark age when Genghis Khan roamed the world. Sensible people, those who do not love war, our country is fortunate if we can achieve our goals without fighting." Northern California Democratic Senator Bailey said that if the United States adopts a tough policy, it may be easier to avoid war than to allow "Hitler to kick us."

Editorial

### Do Not Let Necessities Become Hoarded Goods

Having goods is having wealth, without manipulation, without hoarding, and with self-appreciation; the arrival of this wealth is as if bestowed by heaven, unrelated to human effort. This is the proud saying of those in the industrial and commercial circles and among the hoarders. Tracing back to the continuous soaring of commodity prices, ten times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times different, with metals, Western medicines, building materials, coal, rice, flour, yarn, cotton, and imported goods being the most prominent. The emergence of newly rich individuals with fortunes of one or two tens of millions is not uncommon in today's society. Who would believe that this is not war profiteering? Without national crisis, how could it come to this? The god of war is an evil god, posing a serious threat to general life, and it is painful to speak of. The god of war is also a god of wealth. Those who profit from the national crisis are delighted with him.

Medicines are used to treat people, but some who have medicines refuse to respond to the needs of the sick, and deliberately raise their prices, resulting in death before treatment. Yarn, cloth, rice, and flour are mostly hoarded, causing more than just hunger and cold, but also the threat of starvation. Hoarding coal and being reluctant to sell it leads to a great fuel shortage. The value of metals increases tenfold or a hundredfold, not only causing the cost of industrial products to soar, but also making everyday utensils extraordinarily expensive. The chaotic rise in prices of imported goods can be described as having no fair market. How can people not suffer, and hoarding not flourish?

However, looking back at the lives of the masses, vitality fades daily as commodity prices rise; savings dwindle as hoarding intensifies. All industries are said to be making fortunes, but the business of shops is constrained by purchasing power and becomes increasingly evident. The early closure of night markets is becoming more frequent. The usual so-called profits are all spoken of in terms of the amount of currency that can be obtained from the buying and selling of goods. Before the goods are sold, the profit is still uncertain. Today's legal tender, not to make a malicious argument, is thought by some to be treading the path of the Mark and Ruble. This shows a lack of understanding of the differences between the situations in Germany and Russia at that time and China today. If there were to be a major unprecedented change in legal tender, why would there be the various measures currently being taken? This shows that those who doubt the legal tender are wrong. Furthermore, observing recent events, the movement of legal tender to the south is substantial; the relocation of funds inland is both encouraged and guaranteed, clearly showing signs of contraction in Shanghai's currency. Looking again at the Stabilization Fund's announcement, "Regarding the large quantities of necessities stored in Shanghai, the foreign exchange supply previously stipulated was quite generous, but recent speculative activities and widespread hoarding have caused prices to rise, which is deeply regrettable. However, the Stabilization Fund intends to increase the convenience of foreign exchange for transporting necessities to areas in China that have not fallen and to refugee areas, no matter what." Looking at this, people in Shanghai do not need to worry excessively about foreign exchange for necessities. The only hope is that the goods that can be obtained are not manipulated by the magic of speculative hoarding and do not fall into its clutches!

The authorities in the two concessions are now working on this. The Superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Council's recent remarks at a reception for reporters on adjusting prices within the concessions are mainly aimed at controlling the previous lax management. If this is followed and not just treated as a formality, it will be of great help in leveling prices and stabilizing life. It should be known that the government still supplies Shanghai with foreign exchange for necessities, solely for the welfare of the Chinese and Western people. Speaking of leakage, blocking is the best policy. It is also for the sake of the business of friendly merchants. Otherwise, there are some things that are not absolutely essential for life, and they are also given foreign exchange assistance. However, desires are endless, and financial resources are limited. If the Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai do not have the spirit of hard work and thrift in wartime and only seek current enjoyment, continuing to squander Chinese financial resources and consume them on unnecessary items, the regret will be seen, and there may be a day when it cannot be avoided.

Furthermore, what is called a necessity has no fixed definition and varies with the level of life. For example, gasoline. When used for police vehicles, fire trucks, ambulances, and other emergency services, and when there is no choice but to use a car, it is certainly a necessity. However, if it is used for commuting, going for a drive, and enjoying oneself, it is not based on general life standards. It is for enjoyment and cannot be called a necessity. What is essential for general life should be allowed as a necessity, and it is not permissible to only consider the convenience of a certain stage or type of person as a necessity. Furthermore, the raw materials supplied with foreign exchange must not be used to frequently raise prices after they become products, such as tobacco and cigarettes. Nor can they be manipulated by people in the industry and hoarders, using warehouse receipts for trading, so that genuine consumers have to seek high prices and even sigh that they cannot obtain them. Nor should they be absorbed and monopolized by people in the industry, such as British and American medicines, whose sources have never been interrupted, but are still difficult to obtain, which is hardly the original intention of supplying medicines with foreign exchange to benefit patients! Now that the concession authorities are working for the welfare and survival of the citizens within the concessions, do not let necessities become hoarded goods, and do not allow people to be delighted with the fact that having goods is having wealth. This is what the public looks forward to.

Furthermore, a prerequisite for stabilizing commodity prices

In recent days, in the Shanghai market, various speculative trades have been soaring in price, as if in a frenzy. As a result, everyday items have become extraordinarily expensive, causing the small people who barely survive to fall into deeper water and fire, making it difficult to struggle, and harming people's livelihoods without end.

The rise and fall of normal commodity prices may be due to cost, or due to supply and demand, or due to currency value. There should be clues to follow, and the degree of rise and fall should also have a certain limit. But this is not the case now. In a matter of days, the price of gold has more than doubled, reaching over 20,000 yuan per bar. It is clear that this is not entirely due to cost, supply and demand, or currency value. Ordinary items only follow the lead of gold. As the price of gold rises, all things rise with it. As a result, speculators are increasingly pursuing long positions, and those with capital are competing to hoard. As a result, each item, because of more hoarding and less circulation, becomes more expensive, which is more beneficial to those who take long positions and hoard. This continues in a cycle, causing prices to gradually increase without end. In a word, nothing is free from the mischief of gold, which is the worst of instigators.

To relieve people's livelihood, commodity prices must be stabilized. And to get to the root of the problem, gold prices must be suppressed. Gold is owned by the state, as has long been stipulated. And the authorities are extremely concerned about the livelihood of the people, so illegal buying and selling of gold, arbitrarily raising its value, causing all things to be stimulated and prices to increase daily, severely harming our people, goes against the authorities' intention to love the people. Moreover, judging from the current market situation, the long positions may seem to be gaining double profits, and it is not difficult to become a wealthy family. But who knows that shaking up the market, disturbing livelihoods, and continuing in this way will inevitably lead to a disaster that cannot be saved. Once commerce stagnates, people become panic-stricken, and society becomes unstable, if the skin is gone, where will the hair be attached? This is also what speculators cannot but hope to reflect on.

Furthermore, banks handle pledges to facilitate commerce and regulate finance. But now, speculators use the goods they hoard to pledge to banks for cash, and then use this pledge to continue buying goods and hoarding. After several transformations, the total value of the hoarded goods can exceed the original capital by several times. This uses the funds for regulating the commercial and financial sectors to destroy the livelihood of the common people. The harm is unspeakable. In order to save the market and protect their own safety, all banks should suspend handling pledges for goods during this period, and urge the redemption of those already pledged. In this way, the strength of speculators will be greatly reduced, and the hoarding trend will be far less than before. And many of the goods already hoarded will have to be sold in order to repay the pledge. Once the hoarded goods are circulated, commodity prices will naturally fall, maintaining people's livelihood. This is especially urgent, and we cannot help but look forward to it.

### Fierce German Offensive on the Outskirts of Moscow, Intense Battles Unfold for the City of Tula

Reuters, 31st, London: According to the latest Soviet communiqué, Soviet forces are currently holding their positions in the areas of Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk, Maloyaroslavets, and Tula, resisting the fierce attacks of the Nazi forces. Yesterday, the German forces repeatedly tried to break through the Soviet lines, but were repelled, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. Yesterday, 47 German aircraft were shot down near Moscow. This communiqué confirms the reports from the Soviet news agency that Soviet forces in the Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets areas are launching counterattacks and that the German forces have made little progress. The news agency also stated that Soviet forces have occupied the suburbs of the two cities "N" and "D," and fierce battles are underway. A major battle has begun in the Volokolamsk area after the German forces launched a new offensive. The Soviet side admits that the German forces have made some progress in this area, but their casualties have been severe. Volokolamsk is located halfway between Mozhaisk and Kalinin. The German claim that they have broken through the Perekop Isthmus and entered the Crimean Peninsula has not yet been confirmed. The Soviet side also reported that Soviet forces in Rostov-on-Don have been reinforced and are continuing to resist.

Reuters, 31st, London: According to news received here, German forces are currently pressing hard on Moscow. The most dangerous offensive is one launched from Tula. The Soviet side admits that the situation is serious, but says that it has contained the German forces at every point on the arc-shaped line defending the Soviet capital. If the German offensive from Tula continues unabated, it may be an attempt to bypass Moscow and then attack the Soviet capital from the east.

International News Service, 31st, Kuibyshev: Soviet reports state that German forces today launched fierce attacks on four routes along the arc-shaped line in front of Moscow, through muddy snow-covered ground, but all offensives were repelled. The Soviet side admits that the recent German offensive may represent the greatest threat to the Soviet capital since the war began, but it is widely believed that the Red Army's defenses will be able to hold, and the German forces will not be able to occupy Moscow. The communiqué stated that the Red Army has recaptured several important positions in front of Rostov on the southern front. As for the Crimean front, the German forces have so far failed to build a bridgehead to facilitate their further advance. At the same time, the Red Army has launched an offensive on the Leningrad front and is currently fighting fiercely with the German forces on the outskirts of the city. A Soviet spokesman said that new industries are booming in eastern European Soviet Union. These industries have established a "factory front" for the Soviet forces, enabling them to fight permanently.

United Press, 31st, London: News exchanged in Kuibyshev reports that German forces have launched a new offensive on Crimea with countless tanks, artillery, and aircraft.

Havas News Agency, 31st, Moscow: German forces are now launching a fierce attack on the city of Tula. The city is located in an important location and has a population of 200,000. It is located on the banks of the Upa River, a tributary of the Volga River, and is also one of the Soviet Union's industrial centers. The surrounding area is rich in coal and iron ore deposits.

Havas News Agency, 30th, Budapest: An official announcement stated that Hungarian forces have broken through Red Army resistance and have reached the Donets River.

### Soviet Ten Years of Purge Movement, German and Japanese Spies Eliminated, Stalin's Vision Far-Sighted

Reuters, 31st, New York: Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, published an article in American Magazine, stating that Stalin's Soviet purge movement in the recent ten years aimed to eliminate German and Japanese spies within the Soviet Union. The world mostly refers to the famous treason cases and the purge movement from 1935 to 1938 as hateful examples of barbarism, cruelty, and ingratitude. However, viewing the current facts and researching all the records, it is known that the defendants at that time were all figures employed by the headquarters of the German and Japanese armies, which is indeed beyond doubt. The purge can demonstrate the far-sightedness of Stalin and others.

### Soviet Air Force Generals, Establish Military Exploits, Twenty-Two Promoted

TASS, 31st, Moscow: The Soviet Council of People's Commissars announced a decree promoting four people, including Voroshilov, to the rank of Lieutenant General of the Air Force, and eighteen people, including Belikhiv, to the rank of Major General of the Air Force.

### British Wartime Cabinet, Rumored to be Reorganized

Reuters, 31st, London: Lord Beaverbrook's asthma attack has led political critics to anticipate a possible general change in the cabinet, and speculate that after his recovery, Beaverbrook will go on to a more senior position. Many members of industry and parliament are still determined to demand more planned production of war equipment. The Prime Minister opposes the establishment of a dedicated production department, arguing that this move may not facilitate production. However, if the Prime Minister changes his mind, Beaverbrook's selection as minister of this department seems to be a matter of course.

### Thailand Prepares to Deal with Contingencies, National Defense Expenditure Increases Sharply, Thai-Vietnamese Trade Relations Resume

Reuters, 31st, Bangkok: The Thai Minister of Finance disclosed the contents of the upcoming 1942 November-December fiscal bill when hosting news reporters yesterday. The entire national defense budget is Baht 101,000,000 (equivalent to £10,000,000 British gold). This is Thailand's unprecedented national defense expenditure, because in the full year from January 1939 to September 1940, national defense expenditure was only Baht 30,000,000 (equivalent to £3,000,000 British gold). Although Thailand has decided to strictly adhere to neutrality, it is also preparing to deal with various contingencies. This can be seen from the large increase in national defense expenditure. The Minister of Finance also announced that there is no need to collect new direct taxes, which is greatly welcomed by the business community.

Havas News Agency, 30th, Vichy: A government gazette recently stated that land trade between Vietnam and Thailand, which had been banned by both governments after the Thai-Vietnamese conflict, will resume within days.

### Japanese Spokesman Ishii Issues Statement

Reuters, 31st, Tokyo: When hosting news reporters this morning, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii said that he could not confirm the local newspapers' reports that the US-Japan talks would have a tangible turn before the Parliament holds an extraordinary meeting on November 15. When reporters asked about improper pressure on the Japanese side's interests in Nanyang, Ishii admitted to foreign reporters that this was a question of quantity and not a qualitative question, and admitted that the interests of foreigners frozen in Japan are currently facing the same difficulties, but that the Japanese side's interests are more affected. Ishii also said that Soviet floating mines seem to have disappeared, probably because the Soviet Union is more cautious than before in placing mines. Regarding the appointment of the Japanese ambassador to the UK, there is currently no action, but there is no special reason why the Japanese side has been slow to announce this appointment. Ishii declined to criticize President Roosevelt's Navy Day speech, or to ask for his thoughts on the US President's statement that the United States will continue to help Chongqing. Ishii only said that the US President had repeatedly made similar statements. When reporters asked about the report that Japan intends to set up an air force base in Macau as a result of the establishment of an aviation agreement between Portugal and Japan, Ishii replied that he was not aware of it, but since Japan has an air force base in Guangzhou, which is very close to Macau, there is no need to set up such a base in Macau again. Reporters also asked about the reaction in Japan to a rumor that the UK and the US had reached an agreement to hand over British naval ports, including Hong Kong and Singapore, to the US for use. Ishii replied that if this statement is true, Japan would feel concerned.

### Japanese Envoy Aizawa Goes to Vietnam to Take Up His New Post

Reuters, 31st, Kobe: Japanese special envoy to Vietnam, Aizawa, led a group of 40 members to Hanoi by ship this afternoon. Before his departure, Aizawa told news reporters that he would work hard to strengthen political and economic ties between Japan and Vietnam.

### Two U.S. Passenger Plane Crashes, Total of Thirty-Four Deaths

Reuters, 31st, St. Thomas, Ontario: A passenger plane belonging to an American airline crashed and burned last night fourteen miles from here, killing all twenty people on board.

### Turkey Holds Large-Scale Military Exercises, Showing Its Strong Power

Reuters, 19th, Ankara (Delayed): The Turkish military held large-scale exercises at the racecourse today to commemorate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. Nazi Ambassador von Papen also sat in the diplomatic section to watch the exercises for an hour. The exercises included aircraft performances, paratrooper landings, flamethrowers, smoke machines, mountain artillery, infantry, horse-drawn artillery, mechanized units towing American-made howitzers, British-made anti-aircraft guns, and flat-shooting artillery. However, the Nazi ambassador did not see all of the civil state's war equipment, such as American-made Tomahawk and British-made Hurricane aircraft. Before the exercises, President Ismet Inönü addressed the audience.

### British Collection of Waste Paper Movement, With 100,000 Tons as Standard, For Use in Manufacturing Cartridge Boxes

Reuters, 31st, London: Since Minister of Supply Beaverbrook issued an appeal to the public to collect 100,000 tons of waste paper for use in manufacturing cartridge boxes, within ten days, the national newspapers, business community, and public have responded enthusiastically, aiming to reach the standard stipulated by several local authorities of collecting one ton of waste paper per month from 1,000 residents. Before the start of this movement, local authorities across the country collected an average of half a ton of waste paper per month from 1,000 residents. If this can be doubled, it can save 25,000 tons of ships carrying paper from the US to the UK.

### On the Common People of China

— Pearl S. Buck

The recently published China issue of Asia Magazine features articles by renowned writers such as Edgar Snow, Ms. Utley, Ms. Pearl S. Buck, and Dr. Lin Yutang, all praising the unparalleled and historically significant nature of China's war effort and its inevitable victory. Ms. Pearl S. Buck, as a renowned novelist, discusses the common people of China, offering a perspective deeply rooted in life's philosophy, incisive, profound, and with implied meanings. Below is a selective translation of the original article, deemed suitable for publication. - Editor

One day, I stood on a street corner in Nanjing, which was then the capital of revolutionary China. A young man was giving a speech to a crowd, their interest piqued, listening intently. His topic was a way of life that he offered to the masses, one that would bring immense benefits. It was a time of change; months prior, a significant revolution had occurred in Nanjing. Old officials were forced into exile, and soon after, young people like the speaker eagerly took power. At the time, I was not yet accustomed to revolutionary China and found the speech rather distasteful. Had the old China truly passed, had everything I once knew vanished? What were the crowd listening thinking?

Eventually, the young man with long hair distributed light red tickets. Everyone except me received one. Instead of giving me one, he stared at me for a moment, and then, without warning, spat on my face. A dozen hands reached out, offering handkerchiefs and cloths to wipe it off. The voices were a cacophony of fervent curses. "Bastard!" "Despicable wretch!" An old woman tugged at my sleeve, leading me to an old-fashioned stove. "Come inside – this old woman always has hot water, and a bar of soap too." I washed my face with soap and hot water, thanking her for her kindness. As I was about to leave, I noticed a light red ticket on the floor. It was her ticket; I picked it up.

"Bring this to the First Factory established by the Revolutionary Army, and you can find employment." That's what the red ticket said. Knowing she was illiterate, I read it aloud to her.

"Is that what the ticket says?" she asked, her tone filled with disdain.

"Exactly," I said. "You should keep it safe – it's very hopeful."

She laughed. "These many young lads!" she said comfortably. "Who would believe them?"

"Why not believe them?" I said. "People believe many things these days."

She shook her head. "Yes, but not these things! Who ever heard of people working for nothing? Going to work at a factory, and me not being his relative, nor asking him for a job. No, there's no such person. We'll wait and see." She tore the ticket into pieces and threw them away.

I walked down the street. In the mud, on the wet cobblestones, I saw many tickets stuck. Everyone lived happily in their own way. They listened with curiosity to the young man's preaching, but had never heard such strange ideas. They accepted the hope he offered with one hand, and threw it away with the other. In China, no one trusts what can be doubted.

In these present times, whenever the Chinese people repeatedly listen to the hope given to them, I often recall this story. Which path will they take? Their own path, I know. Other paths are impossible. The world is divided not only between Fascist and democratic politics between nations, but also between individuals. The common people of China do not have this distinction at present. In a nation, society, and family that are greatly divided, the enemy can enter one's own home in a unique and terrible way. Of all the nations existing on Earth since history began, the Chinese people are among the most democratized in character. Is the Chinese nation a continuous lineage? It has been four thousand years. This often gives rise to inappropriate doubts. They are like a memorial fragment, vast in size, obscuring everything from our view. If this were merely a statue, a temple, or a palace, ancient and still practically usable today, it would be a marvel, a sensation for everyone. But this is a nation, the largest nation in the world today, vast in land, with a population accounting for one-sixth of the world's total. Many aspects of the country still retain a medieval state, developing affairs of state at its own pace, not keeping pace with world evolution. Though repeatedly subjected to the encroachments of modern weaponry created by scientists with their minds and energy fully exhausted, it continues to survive. And, despite having no significant resources beyond its vast land, it grows stronger and tougher than it was when the war began. This is China. China has a greater significance because of its vast people and land.

When people speak of the term "nation," it always encompasses more than just land and people. It must include ports, air force, industry, natural resources, imports and exports, military strength, and so on. But China only has people and land. The ports have now been lost, and there are not many to begin with. The air force is extremely small; the Chinese cannot expand a strong air force. From a modern perspective, the development of industry is also not far-reaching. The large enterprises that once existed in a few cities have now disappeared. They have always neglected natural resources other than agriculture. Trade with other countries has not been very active, as they had long anticipated that it would cause trouble. Military force has been traditionally disdained for centuries, with a firm belief that the upper classes would not engage in warfare.

A viewpoint less suited to the modern world is almost unimaginable. When heavily armed Japan attacked China, many people, while acknowledging that China had fully demonstrated resilience in past conquests, were extremely doubtful about its national strength today, because science had perfected all kinds of lethal weapons. According to common sense, China's response was completely unprepared. The domestic troops were untrained, there were very few aircraft, a complete lack of heavy artillery, no modern war experience, and a lack of practical reasons to hope for victory in any way. But everyone knew that the Chinese people demanded war. They responded not to defend land, they even planned strategic retreats, losing vast amounts of land; not to defend certain cities, some cities were voluntarily abandoned, or put to the torch; not even to defend their own lives, lives were disregarded, sacrificed under Japanese arms. The Chinese people fight to defend their right to live as they choose, to become a free and unconquerable nation. Cities can be rebuilt, lost territories can be recovered, because the fundamental land remains, unalterable and indestructible. The Chinese people do not want to be dominated; they are not a nation that can survive under submission.

What kind of people are these many Chinese? Most of them are common people. A very small percentage of the Chinese population is the upper class, 85% are farmers, they live in small villages, making a living from the land. Of the remaining 15%, 10% belong to the small merchant class. The remaining 5% includes the wealthy, the intellectuals, and the ruling class.

Therefore, these common people are China. They made their demands clear, and thus the nation spoke. So they demanded to fight Japan, and the war began, even though the government leaders knew that the defensive weaponry was extremely poor. But the government leaders also knew that the best defense was the spirit of the general public.

In other countries, corruption within can make this public opinion worth considering. China, however, is a country that will not be overthrown. China is unwilling to give itself away to the invaders, nor will it hand itself over to its own appeasers. (To be continued)

### Gold Trading Suspended for Spot Transactions - From $23,100 to $21,600

Yesterday in the Shanghai black market, October futures were settled and cleared. The market only engaged in cash transactions, with significant fluctuations, rising and falling sharply. Continuing the upward momentum from the previous day, amidst consistent buying, the price soared again past the $23,000 mark, actually reaching an unprecedented new peak of $23,100. Later, the Association, realizing that the recent gold price had soared excessively, causing various goods to take the opportunity to rise in price, disrupting the financial system, coordinated with relevant industry peers, such as Tianyuan, Dafeng, Xianghe, Defu, and cash shops and money houses to sell, suppressing the manipulation, and the price retreated below the $22,000 mark. At noon, the close was down $250, with about 4,000 taels traded in half a day. At noon, the Association announced that it originally operated spot forward trading in Shanghai red gold. However, it has been found that a small number of brokers in this city market privately engage in over-the-counter spot transactions, for which the Association does not take responsibility. From now on, brokers are not allowed to engage in spot transactions in this city market, resulting in the suspension of cash trading in the afternoon. However, it was heard that a certain money house sold at an off-market price of $21,600, down another $400, causing jewelry gold to initially reach an unprecedented high of $2,350, eventually falling back to $2,200, down $50.

Cash Off-Market Prices Continue to Fall

Shanghai red gold spot, inheriting the surprising upward momentum of the previous day, inevitably had residual momentum. The market opened and was immediately raised by $250, to $22,500. Gonghe, Decheng, Yutaifeng, and retail investors competed to push up the price, rising to a new high of $23,100. Soon after, Tianyuan and others began selling, stopping the rise, and a downward trend began, falling back $900, to $22,200. After a brief period of absorption by Hesheng Hong Kong banks, it was pushed up again, rising to $22,900 around 10:30. Soon after, Tianyuan and others competed to sell, and Xiangxing Yongfu sold, and the downward trend intensified, gradually falling $1,000, declining to $21,190. Xinyuan vigorously purchased, and Tianyuan also entered, raising the price to $22,500. Finally, under the selling pressure from Tianyuan and others, it was pressed down to a noon close of $22,000, $250 lower than the previous day. The high and low in the first half of the day was $1,200, and after the close, it rose to $22,200. Finally, at $21,800, there were sellers. In the afternoon, the off-market price retreated to $21,600, and the market price of the cash shop's own brand gold was $21,900, a reduction of about $1,000.

### Foreign Exchange Market Has Transactions - $2.75 for US Dollars, US Notes Up to $39

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday, both the Central Bank and Bank of Communications postings were flat, and the over-the-counter prices for British and American currencies also remained unchanged. There were even fewer sellers quoting prices on the black market for British and American currencies, and the market situation continued to be tight. An import sugar trading company managed to snatch up current US dollars at an unprecedentedly high price of $2.75, sold by a businessman with a large amount. British exchange also reached a new tight price of 1 shilling 8.75 pence, and only then did exporters offer to sell at the above price, which then slightly hardened. In the afternoon, buyers tended to wait and see because the price was too high, so the closing price for British exchange was 2 shillings, and for US exchange was $3, both with prices being offered for fewer supplies, slightly tightening. Yesterday's foreign currency market situation was slightly softer, with British and American gold pounds each falling by $10. British gold notes sharply fell by $8, and US gold notes had initially risen to as high as $39.20, but in the afternoon, it retreated to $37.40, eventually being $38, a fall of 80 cents compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes still had demand for positions, rising to as high as $8.10 in the evening market. Japanese gold notes continued to rise strongly, rising to $3.45 in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean notes was still balanced, and the evening market still stood at the original price of $2.80.

### Double Horse Yarn After Settlement - Up to $2,900 - Futures Rose to the Limit and Then Up Another $150 - Nianzhihui Brand Yarn Also Jumped $200-300

The spot market for yarn suddenly soared, and the sentiment was unprecedented. This was because the gold price was wildly volatile, which made buyers extremely excited. There was a great sense of yarn shortage in the market. As long as sellers were willing to let go, buyers would be straightforward and quick to grab it. Such a situation had never been seen before. The average price of 20-count miscellaneous brand yarn jumped by a huge $200-300. It was said that the raw materials were expensive, the factory's costs had increased, or there were measures to reduce labor, so households with ample economic resources vigorously absorbed it. At the same time, the exchange and the Jinshuangma market could not open and stopped trading. Speculators were unanimously proceeding to the spot market. The high price of 20-count double horse factory singles was $2,900 to $880, and after closing it was $2,820-30. In the afternoon, it was rumored that it had reached $3,000. In the afternoon, the exchange opened, the yarn rose $119.90, the cloth rose $4.50, and all stored chips were settled clearly. Future new transactions will be made according to new policies.

The Jinshuangma futures market, after the October delivery, has begun trading. Its market price is rising, and buying interest is looming. The actual yarn factory single was announced to settle at $2,370.00, and the market sentiment turned steady. The futures market opened, and the trend was surprisingly high. General practitioners fueled the flames, making great strides. The prosperity of the buying interest was unprecedented. The market price jumped sharply. The November opening rose to the limit of $2,448. December 1504, also rose to the limit, and January followed, rising to the limit of $2,558, while the dark market for near and far terms, after being blindly raised by general speculators, actually rose by more than $150-60 each. Such a market state can be called unprecedented. However, observing that the factory single has risen sharply and stopped briefly, and prices have risen sharply with it, the lives of the common people have been hit hard, so its settlement price is stable, and the futures yarn has shown a fierce upward trend again. The future is difficult to predict, but practitioners should still be more cautious. The results all rose to the limit.

### Cotton Prices Continue to Rise

The spot cotton situation followed the yarn market and continued to rise, and those holding goods were unwilling to release them, which shows the strength of people's hearts in general. The market price rose by a distance of $20-30.

Fire engine grass bag 500 bags $550.0 Hongzhang Factory

One hundred and one pieces of Yimula $655.0 Jiajinjia

Another 100 pieces $650.0 also

One hundred pieces of Pingguoer $520.0 also

One hundred pieces of coarse velvet packed $560.0 also

One hundred pieces of Meipeng Singapore $870.0 also

Two hundred pieces of Lanhua $620.0 also

Another 200 pieces $618.0 also

Another 200 pieces $590.0 also

New York cotton market rose due to excessive rainfall in the Mississippi River basin, which had an impact on cotton production. Fellow traders and New Orleans bought more actively. As a result, yesterday's closing price rose by eight or nine pounds of sound compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to purchases by European exporters and speculators, but later suddenly turned back down due to the looming war clouds in the Far East and Japan gradually entering a state of war. Yesterday's closing prices each fell by about one rupee. It is also predicted that the opening market situation today will rise by two rupees.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Publicly Sells Rice - Special Ship Arrives at the Port - Fluctuations are Nothing More Than Speculation

The Shanghai Municipal Council's affordable-priced foreign rice continued to arrive in large quantities at the port. Yesterday morning, Jardine Matheson's Taisheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai, specially loaded with 20,400 bags of affordable-priced foreign rice for the Shanghai Municipal Council from Hong Kong, with no other cargo. It is currently docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition, the company's Yongsheng Wheel arrived at the port yesterday afternoon around 3 o'clock, also carrying 5,892 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, as passenger cargo, and is docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (Zu)

In the morning, there was a small batch of newly arrived affordable-priced foreign rice, and the people's hearts were stabilized by the large supply to the sales outlets, and the market was quite fair. Moreover, some floating households released profits, and the spot price of the small batch gradually dropped from $162.50 to $158-9. The supply was sufficient, and actual sales were flat, so the market could have been stable, but speculators and line merchants and pie-merchants took the opportunity to absorb them, and rumors and the soaring gold price suddenly rose again. Large households inside and outside the industry and floating merchants and other households followed suit, and for a time it was cloudy. Yinzhan Small Grain opened at $161, and foreign shops at $160. However, the general floating households, because of the affordable rice, took advantage of the high price to come out again, and then returned to fatigue. Yinzhan Small Grain fell to $159, and foreign shops to $158, intending to lure the enemy in deep, and taking the cheap opportunity to absorb it. There were also additional purchases in actual sales, and the situation suddenly tightened, and each price rose again. The closing price of Yinzhan Small Grain returned to $163, and foreign shops to $162, No. 1 Saigon high goods $185-6, ordinary $183-4, Zhongguan $181-2, No. 2 $164 half, followed by $160, No. 1 Siam $176.20, followed by $172, No. 2 $161-160, high $164, Java tip high $180-178, Zhongguan $175, broken tip high from $135 acupoint, followed by $129, 
This is five or six yuan higher than the previous morning's closing price, and the British China Division has risen by three or five yuan from 191.5 to 192.3 yuan. The results are three or five yuan higher than the previous market, with more than 30,000 bags transacted. The British China Division has nearly 1,000 tons. As for the current inventory, there are a total of 92,513 bags, which is 62,605 bags less than the previous period. A total of 34,161 bags were delivered this week.

The arrival of new thick and thin broken japonica rice is slightly sparse, with only a hundred or so stones. Because the price of foreign rice has tightened, the sales market has also become lively, rising by one or two yuan. The early break of Kainangang is $191-2, the new Kunshan japonica is $191-2, the Qingjiao Mizhong and Fenjing Baige are all $191-2, the wild rice is out of stock and there is no market, and the glutinous rice has a large number of Jindan Guonuo arriving at the port, with a total of five or six hundred bags, and subsequent batches continue to be shipped to Shanghai, so people's hearts are slightly calm. Hong Kong Baiyuan is opened at a high price of $200, followed by $195, Glutinous Lu is $183-4, and Jindan Guonuo is $195.

### Foreign Flour Wildly Rises - Actually Asking for $60

Yesterday, the speculative atmosphere for foreign flour became more and more intense, and the price of American Kemp flour increased by about $5, because the large households in the industry have been firmly holding on and refusing to sell at a low price in the evening, and new merchants, customers, and floating households are all excitedly absorbing it. The market has already seen a direct increase in cash prices. Yesterday, due to rumors and favorable environmental factors, and also because of the North Exchange relationship, buyers were even more enthusiastic, but the actual sales in the streets only need 8,000 bags, or even 10,000 bags, while there are more than one million in stock. The customer help enters a lot and loads less, which is also a thoughtful transaction. Yesterday, the speculative groups disregarded the people's food and continued to raise prices. The Pao Tai morning market was $55, followed by an increase of one or two yuan, reaching $58.60 and still lacking sales. In the evening market, there were actually calls for $60. Jinlong's early market was $53, and in the afternoon it reached $56.50, with calls for $57. The speculative appetite has not yet been satisfied, and the poor have no day to survive. It is hoped that the two authorities will truly realize the sale at a fair price as soon as possible, and especially that the existing flour should be drawn in advance for a fair price. On the one hand, they should persuade merchants and firms with goods to sell them quickly, and on the other hand, they should only allow actual sales in this street to be bought, and then the market will be better.

### Public Bonds Turn Around in the Afternoon - Foreign Stocks Become Active Again

The black market for public bonds, yesterday the market sentiment was still weak and soft, in the morning, the C type once broke through the $5 mark, and then saw a new small price of $4.70, but because the decline was too large, it then rushed out of $5 again. In the afternoon, the market sentiment was stronger, and it once reached as high as $6, but it still retreated into $6 due to being unsupported. The ups and downs of the B type were even greater, with a high-low difference of $1.50. After the violent decline, there was a sudden sharp rise, and it seemed that it would temporarily tend to hover in such a daze. Yesterday morning, Runde Tongsunde Changjiu Feng and the newly listed Senchanghao also had quite a few transactions, but Yixun's sales were quite strong. The B type opened at $67.60 and fell straight to $6.30. Yuhe Yitai Xiehe Yuanyongkang Runli also sold one after another. The noon close rebounded slightly, falling by a few cents. The situation improved in the afternoon, and the selling pressure was slightly reduced, with a sharp increase of half a yuan to one yuan. Datong Lianhe Hongda Yitai and Renfeng all had purchases. On the 25th, Shengxing Dingkang Xinfeng Runde and others all sold, but the trend has turned to demand exceeding supply, and the C type has seen $6, and the B type has returned high and is approaching $8. In summary, the D type fell by 70 cents due to not falling the day before, and the E type continued to be small by 25 cents, while the rest have recovered by about 10 cents, with a total turnover of about $2.12 million. A brief table is listed below.

In stock trading, 300 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of $69.00. Various Chinese merchant stocks were also quite active.

The stock market of the Public Industry Institute has become active again, and the general prices are higher than the previous close. The upward trend of yarn factory stocks is particularly strong, and new high prices are seen stacked up. Other stocks such as Qia Beer and Paper also have new prices found, while the upward trend of the rest is relatively moderate. The trend of rubber stocks is firm, and it is more than enough than industrial stocks.

### Futures Sugar Rushes Out of the $300 Mark

The sugar market was stimulated and skyrocketed by the gold tide, and the November 20th futures rushed out of the $300 mark, so trading was suspended. The afternoon was slightly calmer. As a result, it rose by about $14. Spot rose by $21-2 to $18. Dutch Red rose by $8. The price of the Car White rose by $18 to $20. The company's futures for 24th crude white on November 10th initially was $291, then to $93, and the 20th was $302, all of which were suspended from trading. The afternoon turned calm. The 10th opened at $290 and closed at $91.80, the highest being $94 and the lowest being $82. Over-the-counter was $89.50. The 20th opened at $302 and closed at $299, the highest being $305 and the lowest being $96. Over-the-counter was $99. The Public Association's price plate, the spot price of 24th grade crude white for October import was $277 in the morning, as high as $97, $90 in the afternoon, $93, $1, $90 for September, $96, $84, $89, $90 in the afternoon, $92, $90, $88 in the afternoon for August, $85 for July, TaiKoo Car White B mark $298, HX mark $270, totaling more than 38,000 packages of future and spot.

Sugar has arrived in Shanghai in succession. The previous day, TaiKoo Company's Hanyang Wheel transported more than 2,000 packages from Hong Kong, as recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Jardine Matheson Company's Yongsheng transport arrived at the port yesterday, also bringing 3,006 packages of sugar from Hong Kong, docking at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.

### Tongdeli Coal Still Sells Legal Tender

Tongdeli white coal, since the new goods arrived the other day, the industry and its merchants have calculated in US dollars, which has been criticized by all walks of life and is very inconvenient, so since the other day, the previous agreement has been abandoned and it has been changed to selling legal tender. No. 1 and No. 2 pieces are opened at $750 per ton, and colleagues can pick it up by themselves, limited to current sales and no warehouse receipts are issued, so people's hearts have calmed down recently and the market atmosphere has flattened. It is hoped that the colleagues who manage Hongji White Coal can also follow suit, open up current sales, and not hoard them all the time, causing the black market to soar wildly and affect people's livelihoods.

### Li De'er and Others to Soon Depart for Hong Kong: Comprehensive Planning for Foreign Exchange Matters; Unprecedented Actions Taken to Suppress and Stabilize Prices; Market Chaos Expected to Turn Around

The Stabilization Committee Will Supply Essential Goods and Foreign Exchange with a New Approach

According to news yesterday morning, Li De'er, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and American Director Mr. Smith, will depart Shanghai for Hong Kong on Sunday to confer with the Exchange Stabilization Fund in order to obtain more foreign exchange for Shanghai merchants to purchase essential goods. This is an unprecedented step that the Municipal Council will take to suppress and stabilize prices. It is reported that Li De'er and Mr. Smith will submit a detailed report on the foreign exchange needs of Shanghai importers to the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The purpose of their consultation with the Fund is to achieve closer cooperation between the two parties on various foreign exchange matters related to Shanghai. To achieve this goal, the two will submit a detailed report to the Exchange Stabilization Fund describing the current situation here. Shanghai is expected to benefit greatly from this soon.

Increased Foreign Exchange Allocation, Improving Situation

The Exchange Stabilization Fund disclosed on [date missing] that it will provide greater foreign exchange facilitation for various imported goods into Shanghai, except for luxury goods. This is a sign that the trade, price, and exchange rate situation in Shanghai will improve. Yesterday, Reuters reported from Hong Kong that the Exchange Stabilization Fund will increase the foreign exchange allocated to Shanghai for the import of food and coal in November, which is a confirmation to the Shanghai business community that the Stabilization Fund has revised its policy. Qualified individuals here also said that the new liberal stance taken by the Exchange Stabilization Fund goes far beyond this. Coal merchants and banks all said on the surface that they had not received verifiable Reuters news, but in informal conversations, they all expected to receive confirmation "immediately." The impact of this development will likely benefit all aspects of citizens' lives.

Tense Situation Will Ease

Take coal as an example. The price of Zhao Nan coal has recently skyrocketed, rising by about 100 yuan per ton each week. It is also rumored that a major coal import company is considering closing down if it does not receive foreign exchange from the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The municipal authorities are also unable to maintain the stability of coal prices. Now, Shanghai coal merchants will definitely be able to obtain foreign exchange from the Exchange Stabilization Fund soon, so the coal problem will greatly ease. If factors such as freight can also be resolved, then the price of coal in Shanghai is expected to fall back to normal levels. The same is true for other various goods. According to explanations from people in the Shanghai financial community, the Exchange Stabilization Fund's granting of more liberal foreign exchange facilitation is not due to a policy change, but because its organization has been completely completed. In theory, the restrictive measures considered necessary to block foreign exchange loopholes are no longer needed. The Exchange Stabilization Fund has been meeting daily for the past three weeks and has paid considerable attention to the difficulties in Shanghai.

Mr. [Name] Manages Rice, Wheat, and Coal

An authoritative source from the Shanghai Municipal Council also stated yesterday that the upcoming trip to Hong Kong by Chairman Li De'er and American Director Mr. Smith is the result of long-term research and discussion. Before the two decided to go to Hong Kong, they had already reached a principle agreement on which goods needed more foreign exchange. According to sources familiar with the matter, the goods that will be most impacted by the Municipal Council's implementation of price control plans are rice, wheat, and coal. Although rice has already been under control, in order to ensure continuous imports to stabilize prices, it is necessary to first obtain a definite guarantee on foreign exchange supply. Although the Municipal Council and the Exchange Stabilization Fund have been in contact regarding wheat and coal, there have been no concrete results. Therefore, Mr. Li and Mr. Smith will personally explain the situation to the Stabilization Fund authorities in Hong Kong. As for seasonings, decontamination materials, medicines, tobacco, soap, and pigments, the Municipal Council has also decided to control their prices, but their importance is significantly less than that of rice, coal, etc. The Municipal Council also hopes that citizens will wait patiently for news during this period and not easily believe rumors, so as not to give profiteers the opportunity to raise prices indiscriminately.

Foreign Exchange for Films Shows Promise

The danger that Shanghai cinemas will be forced to close due to Western film distributors not receiving foreign exchange has almost disappeared. It is said that the Exchange Stabilization Fund will reclassify films from the "luxury goods" category to the "essential goods" category. According to sources, Mr. Hague, the representative of the Shanghai Western Film Merchants Association, has returned to Shanghai after talking to the Exchange Stabilization Fund in Hong Kong. This will ensure that Shanghai does not lose its films, which are a major source of entertainment. Those in charge also reported that the Exchange Stabilization Fund "has already allocated" foreign exchange for the import of films. It is said that after Mr. Hague presented everything in Hong Kong, the members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund believed that films should be reclassified into the "essential goods" category, but asked Mr. Hague to submit a written report explaining the reasons why foreign exchange should be allocated. Mr. Hague complied. The members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund are currently studying this report and have not yet formally responded to Mr. Hague, because American experts and Chinese representatives are all in Chongqing. The reporter asked Mr. Robateau, the chairman of the Western Film Merchants Association, about this matter, and Mr. Robateau replied, "It is quite optimistic."

Baker & Co. Begins Registration

When Mr. Felippu, the Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council, gave a speech at a reception for reporters the other day, he stated that an association of importers and manufacturers would be organized and that the British firm Baker & Co., located at 17 The Bund in the Public Concession, would be entrusted to handle the registration. The Dazhong News Agency reporter specifically inquired about everything at the firm yesterday afternoon. It is said that although the firm has not yet received the various registration regulations issued by the authorities, Mr. Baker, the manager of the firm, has notified the company's staff to handle the registration of importers and manufacturers in Shanghai from yesterday. Baker & Co., formerly known as Harmony Merchants, was established in 1847 and renamed Baker & Co. in 1916. It has a history of 95 years. Its business scope is very wide. In addition to handling the import and export of various goods, it also serves as a liaison for various importers and manufacturers, so it has a close relationship with various industries in Shanghai. This time, it has been entrusted by the authorities to handle the registration of the Importers and Manufacturers Association, which should be able to complete it successfully. It is said that once the registration matters are completed, the authorities will convene a meeting to discuss further steps to prevent speculation and profiteering, and to suppress and stabilize prices.

### Special Business Tax to be Levied; Investigation and Valuation

The Industry and Commerce Bureau of the Public Concession has decided to levy a special tax on business premises from New Year's Day next year, and has hired valuation and investigation personnel to carry out the work. As the implementation date is approaching, the Bureau has decided to dispatch investigators from today to various districts in the central, northwestern, and eastern regions to conduct investigations in the alleys to clarify whether the houses are residential or business premises. Once the investigation is completed, it will be handed over to the valuation personnel to carry out the valuation in order to implement the collection of the special tax on schedule.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Establish Rice Sales Outlets; Citizens Can Purchase Directly; Those Willing to Sell Can Apply

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that in order to ensure that the people of Shanghai can purchase rice directly from the Council at the Council's set price when they cannot purchase SMC rice from retail rice shops, it has decided to temporarily establish rice sales outlets in the central sections of both the north and south of the Suzhou Creek. Individuals or businesses willing to handle sales at these rice sales outlets as agents under the supervision of the Council can submit written applications to the Chief's Office of the Council. However, applicants must have experience in retailing rice in Shanghai, be familiar with the situation, and be able to provide sufficient staff to ensure that the agency matters can be properly carried out. When submitting the application, it is necessary to attach supporting documents and explain other important information. Applications must be submitted before November 5th; applications submitted after the deadline will not be considered.

### Postage Rates to Increase Today; Telegraph Fees to Hong Kong and Macau Also Increase

The Shanghai Postal Administration, by order of the Kunming Postal Headquarters, will increase postage rates for all mail sent abroad from today, whether airmail or printed parcels, heavy items, by 100%. The postage for each ordinary mail item weighing 20 grams will increase from 50 cents to 1 yuan.

Detailed Rates of the Postal Union

The Shanghai Post Office will publish a new price list in the near future. Postage for mail to all countries in the Postal Union, except Japan, Korea, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and the Kwangchowan Leased Territory, will increase by 100%. Each ordinary mail item weighing 20 grams or any fraction thereof will increase to 1 yuan. Each additional 20 grams or any fraction thereof will increase by 60 cents. Printed matter, newspapers, books, etc., will increase by 20 cents for every 50 grams. Samples and documents will be charged as printed matter, but commercial insurance documents, even if they weigh 250 grams, will be charged according to the prescribed unit. The registration fee will increase from 50 cents to 1 yuan, the express delivery fee will be 2 yuan, and the fee for a double-registered return receipt will be 1 yuan. A single postcard will be 60 cents, and a double postcard will be 1 yuan and 20 cents.

Airmail Rates

Airmail rates, including the existing Pan American Airways Clipper (RAA), foreign aircraft (JAL) on foreign routes, and the Dutch route, which are carried by the above-mentioned aircraft, will also increase simultaneously. For example, airmail to the United States weighing 5 grams, including ordinary postage, will cost 8 yuan and 50 cents. Airmail to South America and Central America will cost 14 yuan per 5 grams. Airmail to the UK, France, Portugal, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and other European countries will increase to 20 yuan and 80 cents per 5 grams. Airmail to various places in the Philippines will cost 7 yuan and 80 cents per 5 grams. If registration or express delivery is required, a separate postage fee will be charged. Airmail to Bangkok, Saigon, Hanoi, and French Vietnam is currently carried by Japanese aircraft departing from Guangzhou. The Shanghai Post Office has already been accepting these items, and will also increase rates by 100% from today. The only difference is that the postage for the Shanghai-Guangzhou air route will not increase. Airmail to foreign countries can be sent via CNAC (i.e., ON.A.G) special flights from Chongqing to Yangon. The original rate was 25 cents per 5 grams, but this rate will be charged the same as domestic airmail and will not be increased.

Hong Kong and Macau Telegraph Fees

The Shanghai Daibei & Pacific Telegraph Companies will increase the prices of all telegrams sent to Hong Kong and Macau from today. The price of ordinary telegrams to Hong Kong will be 1 yuan and 54 cents per word, code telegrams will be 93 cents per word, and Chinese code telegrams will be 77 cents per word. For telegrams to Macau, ordinary telegrams will be 1 yuan and 87 cents per word, code telegrams will be 1 yuan and 13 cents per word, and Chinese code telegrams will be 93 and a half cents per word, an increase of about 40% compared to the price increase in September.

### British Authorities Reissue Evacuation Order for Nationals: A Precautionary Measure

The information counselor of the British Embassy reiterated the previous order the other day, urging British nationals to evacuate. This matter seems to have attracted considerable attention among some people. However, according to the Xin Sheng News Agency's inquiry from British officials, this reissued evacuation order is still limited to women and children and men who do not need to stay. Other British nationals will not evacuate due to temporary tensions. Currently, there are still more than 4,000 British nationals in Shanghai, of which one-fifth are women. Since the United States announced the evacuation of its nationals last autumn, British officials have also advised British nationals to evacuate, but with very little effect. This reiteration of the previous order is nothing more than a precautionary measure and should not be regarded as the United Kingdom abandoning Shanghai's commercial position and other interests. Currently, British nationals who evacuate have five destinations: Malaya, India, Burma, Australia, and New Zealand.

### Gas Stations to Suspend Supply on Sundays Starting Today

It is understood that in order to reduce sales volume and ensure that existing gasoline can be maintained for a longer period of time, some major kerosene companies in Shanghai will close some gas stations every Sunday starting today. The Texaco Oil Company of Shanghai announced yesterday that from November 1st, all gas stations will stop supplying gasoline every Sunday, but the service of adding lubricating oil will not be stopped. Another oil company will take the same approach. Gas stations located outside the boundary will stop supplying gasoline on holidays. Oil distribution certificates for November have been distributed to customers by various oil companies, and customers are advised to comply with the oil consumption on the distribution certificates, as no further increases in supply will be considered except in special circumstances.

### Boiled Water Price Increase Today: 3 Cents Per Ladle; Ladle Size Relaxed

The more than 540 boiled water shops (tiger stoves) in the city have barely been able to maintain their business since purchasing cheap coal ash. Although prices have risen and expenses have been huge, in order to take care of the four major social problems and the livelihoods of the common people, boiled water was still sold for 2 cents per ladle in national currency. Recently, the price of low-priced coal has also increased, and [shop owners] have successively sent letters to the Shanghai Boiled Water Shop Trade Association, requesting a reasonable increase in the price of hot water to maintain their capital. The association once dispatched two members, Zhang Delong and Li Jianming, to solicit opinions from the shop owners and convened a meeting to plan for good measures. However, due to a lack of resources and energy, it was finally resolved that from today, the price of boiled water will be temporarily increased by 1 cent in national currency. However, the association has produced 600 new copper ladles, which are slightly larger than the old ladles currently in use, and the volume will also be increased. The association has notified all fellow traders in the city to sell water at the agreed price and not to exceed it. Shop owners can claim new ladles from the association soon to unify the water sales.

### Low-Priced Foreign Rice: Another 20,000 Bags Arrived Yesterday; Hoping for Public Cooperation to Prevent Hoarding

A large quantity of SMC's low-priced foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. As reported yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Hanyang wheel transported more than 20,000 bags of SMC low-priced rice from Hong Kong. It is now learned that the Jardine Matheson Company's Taisheng wheel arrived in port from Hong Kong yesterday, carrying 10,400 bags of SMC low-priced foreign rice. In addition, the company's Yongsheng wheel also arrived in port at 3:00 PM yesterday, also transporting 5,892 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which were passengers and cargo, and were also unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf. A large number are still arriving.

Expanded Sales

Yesterday, it was learned from the Shanghai Municipal Council that the Council has now decided to expand the sale of low-priced Hong Kong rice, selling each picul (160 catties) for 117 yuan in national currency. Large quantities of low-priced rice have been rushed here. All rice shops can register with the contracting foreign firm, and after being approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council, they can pay for the goods and sell them at the prescribed low price at their stores, so that the common people can purchase nearby and help alleviate the people's difficulties. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council sincerely hopes that all citizens will jointly prevent the hoarding of food rice. If anyone knows the inside story, they can report it directly to the nearest police station or the Municipal Council, so that personnel can be dispatched immediately for secret investigation. Once the investigation is confirmed, it will be dealt with according to law.

### Fundraising for Winter Relief

The Sanjiao Daoyuan Charity Association has decided to start winter relief early from today, with the aim of distributing rice meals (each book of 50 tickets is sold for 10 yuan) and clothing (each item of 3.3 catties is sold for 13 yuan), so that charitable people can purchase and distribute them. The association also distributes them itself. Yesterday, various circles donated thousands of yuan to the winter relief fund. At the same time, it is also engaged in relief for orphans and widows, with a quota of 100 households. Registration has already begun, and once the investigation is completed, they will be given support separately. Various parties have heard the news and donated funds. As for the rice and clothing coupons, Wing On, Sincere, and Sun Sun coupon departments all sell them on behalf of the association.

### German Raider Supply Ship Repainted and Renamed

The German Pacific Raider supply ship, flying the Japanese flag and calling itself the Japanese transport ship, arrived in Shanghai late at night on the 27th of last month and berthed at pontoons 6 and 7. The details were reported yesterday. It is now learned that the ship's body was originally light green, but it was suddenly repainted dark gray the other day, and the ship's name was written as "Tenjitsu Maru." Yesterday, it was still berthed at the original location and will soon leave Shanghai.

### French Concession Police Officers All Receive a 20% Salary Increase

The French Concession's Municipal Council believes that the recent surge in prices in Shanghai and the increase in the cost of living have made it difficult for the police officers of the various agencies under the Council to maintain their livelihoods. It has been resolved and announced yesterday to increase salaries by 20% across the board. The salary for last month has also been issued together with the additional increase. In short, the Council will increase the salaries of police officers of various agencies under its jurisdiction by 20% from October.

### Opening a Large-Scale Settlement to Accommodate 10,000 Beggars; Location Selected Near Zhenru; Construction to Begin Immediately After Approval

The Continental News reports that yesterday (30th), it was learned from responsible parties that a plan to establish another beggar reception center next to Zhongshan Road in the suburbs to accommodate 3,000 beggars has been drafted and is now awaiting approval from the authorities of the two concessions. It has been learned that the municipal authorities of the two concessions have recently jointly established a sub-committee with parties outside the boundary to negotiate a plan to first establish a beggar reception center in the suburbs and have resolved to begin construction and burial immediately after the plan is approved by the authorities.

Next to Zhongshan Road

The houses and land next to Zhongshan Road are allocated by the central district and are sufficient to accommodate the beggars of the two concessions. As for the large-scale beggar settlement, it will take some time to establish. Therefore, this initial plan is taken first. It has been learned that the beggar settlement will

Be Located in Zhenru

Covering 30 acres, it can be prepared to accommodate 10,000 beggars by next spring. According to someone closely related to the plan, after the large settlement is established, the houses next to Zhongshan Road will still be retained so that beggars can bathe, change clothes, and receive medical treatment there before entering the settlement. Now, we are only waiting for the municipal authorities to approve the plan and first send carpenters, tailors, and other skilled beggars to the reception center for training so that they can become the core of the settlement and help guide the remaining beggars to engage in handicrafts next spring when the settlement accommodates all the beggars in Shanghai. A senior official of the Municipal Council said that the Council hopes that this plan will be realized as soon as possible. The work of eliminating beggars on the streets of Shanghai is an important part of the Relief Association's responsibilities.

### Tongshunxiang Rice Shop Thrown a Bomb; Thrower Apprehended

Tongshunxiang Rice Shop at 426 Rue Foch, French Concession, is opened by Zhou Zirong (36 years old), a local. At 4:00 PM yesterday, a man wearing yellow clothes suddenly went to the front of the shop and threw an object wrapped in newspaper. It made a sound when it landed, and the man turned and ran away. The shop assistants followed and caught the man. The people in the shop opened the package and were horrified to find a small hand grenade. Fortunately, it did not explode. They immediately whistled to arrest the bomb thrower and brought him to the police station. According to his confession, his name is Chen Shenggen, 26 years old, from Longhua, Xixiang. He was instructed to throw the bomb to scare and extort money. The police chief ordered him to be detained for further investigation and prosecution.

### Gang Den Smashed in Nanshi; Two Hostages Rescued; One Named Li Shu, One Named Zhao Zhaolian; Gang Members Caught in One Sweep; Car Confiscated According to a secret report from the Xinzha Police Station based on a clue, a large number of Chinese and Western police officers were dispatched together with Japanese military police to Liu Baojia's home at 175 Qiaojia Road, Nanshi, to rescue a hostage named Li Shuchun, and the suspects Pan Jirong, Hu Qingquan, Liu Quan, etc. and Liu Baojia were arrested and detained in the military police team. According to Liu's confession, [police] went to 178 Jiangyin Street, Nanshi,

to rescue hostage

Zhao Zhaolian. According to Liu's confession, [police] continued to Yinghua Street, Datong Hotel No. 235, and arrested 5 accomplices, Sha Zaien, Chen Zheping, Yi Songgang, Bao Chongzheng, Yu Yongde, etc. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin represented the court to state the case, saying that the defendant Sha Zaien was previously a Chinese police officer No. 14 in the Shanghai Municipal Council, but was dismissed for dereliction of duty. He then colluded with the defendants and the detained civil servant Liu Baojia in Nanshi to commit illegal acts. On the evening of the 15th of this month at about 8 PM, [Sha Zaien] and Liu, etc.

drove a car

with two Japanese people to Nanyang Coal Ball Factory No. 1028 on Tokyo Road, falsely claiming to have been sent by the Japanese headquarters to discuss matters with the factory director. When Li Shuchun, an official of the material transportation section, came out to meet [the group], [Li Shuchun] was dragged into the car and driven to Nanshi, where he was hidden in Liu Baojia's home. After the police station was informed and solved the case the other day, according to the confession, [police] rescued the employee of Baolong Foreign Company Zhao Zhaolian (who lives at Lane 15, 345 Meibaige Road, and was kidnapped on the evening of the 25th of this month at 9:00 PM) on Jiangyin Street and seized a Mauser gun, 7 bullets, and

a pair of handcuffs.

Finally, after Sha Zaien was arrested at Datong Hotel, [police] seized two pieces of lead plate for manufacturing fake car permits, and [police] went to Guangxi Road and seized car No. 10488, which was used in the kidnapping case. Because the defendants have committed numerous crimes and Liu Baojia is still detained in Nanshi, the procedures for transferring custody have not been completed. It is requested that the hearing be postponed. Judge Zhong, after reviewing the case, briefly questioned the defendants about their ages and then ordered them to be returned to custody. The hearing was rescheduled to November 15th.

### Dr. Zhu Chunting Begins Practice

What Western medicine calls "Maggage" is actually the Chinese "Tuina" massage. It has miraculous effects in treating arthritis and various nerve-related ailments. The medical sage Hippocrates is said to have remarked that those studying medicine should also learn Maggage, indicating its importance. The art of Tuina in China originated in ancient times. The Yellow Emperor had a "Massage Classic," but unfortunately, the upper volume has been lost. This art is easy to learn but difficult to master. It requires guiding "qi" to penetrate the fingertips, and only with strong fingers can one guide the body's "qi" and blood, ensuring they flow unhindered, thereby eliminating all ailments. Zhu Chunting of Jiading is a student of the renowned Ding Fengshan. He is highly skilled in this art and has now opened his practice at Lane 73, Huanlong Road. Patients are flocking to him. For ailments such as numbness in the limbs, there's no need to take medicine; his touch brings miraculous recovery.

### Shanghai Prostitutes (Middle)

— Translated by Ke Qun

In these cheap brothels, each prostitute must entertain twenty-five customers every night. Although foreigners who visit them try to maintain some degree of hygiene, the fact is that, according to doctors, at least one-third of the customers contract venereal diseases because they do not take preventive measures beforehand.

From my investigation among the prostitutes in these brothels, I learned that most of them come from the countryside. They are not dissatisfied with their current fate, mainly because it is easier to live in the city than in the countryside. Upon closer analysis, most of these women were sold into prostitution by their impoverished parents. Many were pawned into brothels to work as prostitutes for several years. A few were abducted from the countryside and sold into brothels by criminals.

In Shanghai, there exists a sinful profession: trading in young women. Many brokers are scattered throughout the countryside, specializing in buying, pawning, and even abducting women. On the other hand, they also deal in the buying and selling of prostitutes. If their "quality" deteriorates – if they contract venereal diseases or their beauty fades – they are often sold by one brothel to another. However, this is not unique to Shanghai. Many other countries still have this profession to this day. We cannot condemn them for the existence of this sin and disease in Shanghai – neither those who engage in human trafficking, nor the prostitutes, nor the police. It is Shanghai itself that needs the existence of prostitutes, and these women do not feel unhappy. I remember once when I visited a brothel, I heard someone ask: "Why haven't the giant ships of England and America come to Shanghai yet!" What is the reason?

Only a dozen or so high-class brothels in the Public Concession are regularly inspected by doctors; the rest are not. Prostitution is illegal in the Public Concession, but prostitutes are still widespread everywhere. In the French Concession, prostitutes must register. Prostitutes in the French Concession must comply with regulations and undergo medical examinations. However, this does not mean that all prostitutes in the French Concession are clean and disease-free. On the contrary, according to a doctor, the prevalence of venereal diseases in the French Concession is just as common as in the Public Concession.

When prostitutes in the French Concession contract diseases, the authorities can give them a few medical injections, but they are not treated. If they were to be treated, they would have to stop working for several weeks or months, which they cannot afford. Medical injections only remove the external symptoms of the disease. The internal condition remains the same. Therefore, whether they receive medical injections or not, there is no difference in their transmission of the disease to the public. Even if prostitutes have diseases, the brothel owners will not allow them to stop working. If all the prostitutes in the French Concession were given actual treatment, the medical expenses would be enormous. Moreover, this disease continues to flow from the Public Concession into the French Concession!

In the low-class brothels that the reporter observed, I have never seen any of the women pay attention to modern hygiene methods. Several women have also become addicted to drugs. However, most prostitutes never come into contact with narcotics until they have spent several years in this profession. Those who are too addicted to drugs will be expelled from the brothel, left to roam the streets, or resold to even lower-class brothels. Prostitutes who have worked in brothels for several years are sure to be completely infected with diseases. Although they may receive occasional medical injections, they still cannot change the appearance of their illness. At this time, their fate is either expulsion or being sent back to their hometown. If she is expelled, she will start selling sex on the streets, spreading the diseases she has contracted to the lower classes of the city. If she is sent back to her hometown, she will marry someone, and the diseases she has contracted will be passed on to her future children.

### More Than Three Years; Current Education Situation in Anhui Province (1) Registering Unemployed and Out-of-School Students; Adjusting and Strengthening Schools at All Levels

(Lihuang News) Since the incident, education in Anhui has been divided into three stages. During the period from the "July 7th" Incident to 1938, schools at all levels in Anhui suffered damage and were mostly suspended. In 1939, the Education Department, under extremely difficult human and material conditions, engaged in registering unemployed and out-of-school students and restoring schools at all levels. In 1940, on the one hand, it re-adjusted and strengthened the schools that had been restored and established, and on the other hand, it sought to expand the functions of school education, urging schools at all levels to also handle social education, and actively planned to establish a university or college above the specialized level. The current situation of education since the struggle is listed as follows:

Elementary Education (1) Establishing Temporary Elementary Schools. There were originally 33 elementary schools in Anhui Province, but they were all suspended due to the impact of the war. Starting in 1939, the Education Department planned to establish 28 temporary elementary schools. In 1940, another ten schools were added, for a total of 38 provincial temporary elementary schools, with 241 classes, 390 faculty and staff, and 10,665 students. (2) Restoring General Elementary Schools and Short-Term Elementary Schools and Establishing Township and Bao Elementary Schools. There were originally 3,793 county, district, and private elementary schools and 3,800 short-term elementary schools in Anhui Province. In 1938, the Japanese army invaded Jianghuai, causing much destruction. In the spring of 1939, the Education Department urgently sought to restore them, resuming classes in 2,038 general elementary schools and 1,517 short-term elementary schools. In April of the same year, according to the principle of the integration of political education and health in Anhui Province, all original general elementary schools and short-term elementary schools were changed to township and bao elementary schools. According to the statistics reported by the counties, as of the end of 1939, there were a total of 131 township elementary schools and 2,865 bao elementary schools in the province, totaling 4,067 schools, with 5,843 classes, 8,910 faculty and staff, 172,000 students, and expenses of 85,165 yuan. In 1940, the Education Department continued to order counties to raise funds according to the original plan. According to statistics, the counties in Anhui Province had established 522 township elementary schools and four bao elementary schools in the first semester of 1940, an increase of 311 township elementary schools and 1,331 bao elementary schools compared to 1939. Currently, there are 2,723 township schools and 7,035 bao schools in the province. (3) Implementing Education for Orphans. Anhui Province is located in the rear of the Japanese army, and after the catastrophe, many children who suffered were displaced. In the spring of 1939, the Education and Youth Department ordered all temporary elementary schools to accept as many refugee children as possible, providing them with books, uniforms, board, and lodging.

### Overseas Chinese Children in Southeast Asia

— Wu Jiansan

According to my investigation, the total number of overseas Chinese children in the Southeast Asian islands is approximately 900,000. Thailand has the most, with 320,000; British Malaya is second, with 200,000. The Dutch East Indies has 180,000, French Annam has 70,000, and American Philippines has the least, with only 50,000.

These little "Babas" and "Nyonyas" who grow up overseas mostly develop very quickly because of the perennial spring-like climate of Southeast Asia. By the time they are fourteen or fifteen years old, they already have a strong physique and a broad chest, looking like a burly man. Anyone who sees their healthy physique must applaud them, which is incomparable to children who grow up in China.

Our overseas Chinese children are like little angels. They are mostly intelligent, lively, and lovely. However, the hot climate of the equator affects the development of their brains. If they are older, their thinking and memory gradually become dull, and they gradually become foolish. Therefore, they are most unsuitable for learning the rigorous and meticulous sciences. Even a simple math problem of "479 × 368 = ?" often results in an eleven or twelve-year-old overseas Chinese elementary school student getting beaten several times by the teacher with a rattan cane. Their nature is more fond of art, music, sports, and other kinds of things. When they grow up, they often have great achievements. In addition, because they have always lived in foreign lands, they are also very proficient in foreign languages such as English, French, Dutch, and Malay. However, even if they study Chinese for ten or eight years, it is still like facing a Zhang Er Monk: unable to figure it out. This is due to the environment.

When they reach the age of five or six, they are mostly sent to overseas Chinese elementary schools. Their families are mostly well-off, at least middle-class families who do not worry about food and clothing. They have food to eat, things to play with, and books to read. They are happy! However, their smoggy family environment is their greatest misfortune. Their parents are mostly uneducated industrial and commercial classes, with very outdated minds. Therefore, they still use ancient methods to raise their children, which are absurd and inappropriate, to say the least. I say: We should open up that narrow path and let them go to another new world!

Their personalities are just like little monkeys. They are mostly active and dislike being quiet. They can spend the whole day running and jumping outside, such as playing ball, swimming, and climbing mountains, but they are unwilling to sit on a chair for three or two hours to read a thin collection of fairy tales. Their hearts are mostly straightforward and full of emotions. If you tell them a little about the history of China being invaded, it will cause them to clench their small fists and show righteous indignation. If one of their teachers is about to leave them, it will earn them countless innocent tears, like parting from family.

Finally, I must write in bold that the patriotism of these overseas Chinese children is very active. As far as I know, in various parts of Southeast Asia, they gather in groups of three or five after school, carrying a donation iron can on their backs, running five or ten miles, braving the scorching sun in the sky, to beg for relief for their suffering motherland. Over the years, at least one-quarter of the large donations from overseas Chinese to their motherland have been earned by them with their small throats, their sweaty faces, and their passionate patriotism. Lovely little angels!

### Eight Great Advisors of President Roosevelt

— 義道

U.S. President Roosevelt has eight great advisors who meet with him every evening to discuss strategies, report on news from various sectors, and identify and recommend talented individuals. President Roosevelt relies on them as his right and left hands. Below are sketches of these eight advisors:

(1)麥蘭脫 (Mai Lan Tuo)—The current Director of the Government Information Office, possessing strong decisiveness, is therefore deeply trusted by Roosevelt. Mai Lan Tuo previously served as a war correspondent and editor for Howard for many years, so he is very familiar with the ins and outs of the press. During his time as an editor, he wrote articles strongly criticizing the policy of subjecting news to censorship and control. Since becoming the Director of the Information Office, he has visited the White House almost every day to meet with President Roosevelt.

(2) 肖武 (Xiao Wu)—A famous playwright who has written scripts such as "Lincoln" and "Earth and Heaven," which have all been adapted into movies by Hollywood. Xiao Wu is tall and thin, but his enthusiasm and perseverance for work exceed ordinary people. He often drafts speeches for President Roosevelt overnight, not relaxing until they are completed.

(3) 伯力脫 (Bo Li Tuo)—Beautiful and charismatic, she was formerly the U.S. Ambassador to France. During the outbreak of the great war, Bo Li Tuo held almost daily long-distance telephone conversations with Roosevelt across the Atlantic.

(4) 羅純孟 (Luo Chun Meng)—The current Chief Justice of the New York Supreme Court. He is busiest when Roosevelt is preparing to deliver his Fireside Chats. Luo Chun Meng possesses an incredible talent for interspersing humorous and insightful short sentences in speeches, adding a lot of color to the entire address. Luo Chun Meng has edited five major government documents for Roosevelt and can be called President Roosevelt's personal editor.

(5) 奧康諾 (Ao Kang Nuo)—When Roosevelt was practicing law, Ao Kang Nuo served as his assistant lawyer. His younger brother lost the election in 1938 due to Roosevelt's victory, but Ao Kang Nuo's friendship with Roosevelt did not cool down because of this. He is currently the President of the National Institute for Infantile Paralysis.

(6) 弗蘭克夫特 (Fu Lan Ke Fu Te)—It is said that the number of officials recommended by 弗蘭克夫特 is greater than the number personally identified and selected by President Roosevelt. He is erudite and versatile and is essentially Roosevelt's walking encyclopedia.

(7) 克利許 (Ke Li Xu)—The current Librarian of the House of Representatives. His familiarity with the history of various countries has won him Roosevelt's favor.

(8) 伯路起 (Bo Lu Qi)—伯路起 visits the White House every Tuesday to have lunch with Roosevelt and gives a detailed report on the national defense program after the meal. 伯路起 served as the Minister of War Industries from 1917 to 1918, so he has rich experience in wartime production.

### The Real Value of Life

— 非了

Some days ago, a large advertisement for "China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory" was published in the newspaper, with this passage in the middle:

"We manufacture, not remodel: we seek quality, not low prices."

I can't help but nod in agreement, because this is a positive philosophy of life!

Many people think that life is about remodeling, utilizing, making roses more vibrant, and apples bigger.

Many people also think that life is about being opportunistic, economical, bypassing high mountains, and climbing small hills.

This is 100% wrong! A positive life is about manufacturing, inventing. A positive life is about rules and values. Scientists will tell you:

"Many times, I wanted to use a certain piece of knowledge, advocate it, and find a shortcut, but in the end, I ended up going around in circles. I realized that invention relies on self-discovery!"

Experienced businessmen tell you, "I can run an 'old shop,' I can also run a new shop, but I can't run a 'newly reopened old shop.'"

"Yes, silk stockings are discounted," but beware, they will come undone in two weeks. A professor with a white beard will tell you:

"If you want to learn French, it's best to forget English, because every language has its independence."

If you go to church, the pastor will also tell you:

"Christ does not repair the world, but gives the world a demolition and a building."

We have already seen enough, we are making bread, not cutting toast. Everything has to start from the beginning.

"Life is a mystery, a dream," that's just idle work by poets! Underestimating yourself proves that you are "not of good quality": we need a life of real value! No defective goods! No discounts!

### Rubber Made From Gasoline

— 永運

Recently, someone in the United States invented a method of directly producing artificial rubber from gasoline. This is indeed very beneficial to the United States, as it allows them to no longer rely on foreign supplies of this important raw material. This type of newly invented artificial rubber looks very peculiar and interesting. Some people are already using it to manufacture tires and other items. Due to differences in raw materials and properties, the United States also has several other types of artificial rubber. Therefore, national defense experts can choose the rubber with the most suitable properties for manufacturing the desired items at will.

Fourteen Dozen Heroes' Life

The man named Qian, after listening to his long and strange theory, couldn't think of anything to refute him for a moment.

Just then, Xiao Jiqing walked back smilingly.

"Boss Wu, we absolutely can't do it here; because, Brother Qian, as you know," he said, while constantly scanning Qian and Wu's faces with his eyes, "since the fighting started in Zhabei, the market has been terrible. Of the four major theaters in Shanghai, three have closed down in less than two months. Now only we are barely managing. But because of this, there are so many people backstage and in front of the stage, people who stopped working elsewhere are coming to me for a way out. Now there's no need to mention these things! Since it's Mr. Qian's face, as long as Boss Wu doesn't mind being treated unfairly, then there are two opportunities now, it's up to you to choose!"

Two opportunities came at once, which Begonia really didn't expect. Even Qian Ruomo almost dropped half of his cigar from his mouth.

"Then may I ask what those two occupations are?" Autumn Begonia asked in a low voice. (251)

### Examination and Impressions

— Editor

The "Fun Quiz" published on Double Ten Day was enthusiastically participated in by readers, and the letters of application poured in like snowflakes. Within the five-day deadline, a total of 7,534 pieces were received, which can be described as colorful, dazzling, and overwhelming. We started reviewing them on the 20th, and asked four colleagues to help open the envelopes. We first made a statistics of the occupations of the applicants, the results of which were 36% business, 24% academic, 12% labor, and 28% other. It was then decided that the selection would be divided into three steps: preliminary selection, re-selection, and final selection, with me being responsible for grading.

The preliminary selection was divided into two categories, A and B. The emphasis was on the first question. Those who answered with a similar number of days for the initial release period were selected, totaling 1,672 people, while 5,862 were eliminated, averaging less than one-fifth. The re-selection was divided into four categories, A, B, C, and D. The first and second questions were given equal weight, that is, those who got both the Chinese and foreign film initial release periods correct and matched all sixteen couples correctly were ranked A; those who got half of the initial release periods correct and matched the couples correctly were ranked B; those who were slightly off on the number of days but matched the couples correctly were ranked C; and those who were slightly off on both the number of days and the couple matching were ranked D. As a result, 89 people were ranked A, and 95 were ranked B, but the quota was only 100 people, so categories C and D were discarded, and a final selection process was carried out on the 179 people in categories A and B. Since it was called a final selection, it was of course necessary to be extra careful. It was still divided into four categories, A, B, C, and D, and 100 people were selected from the 179 people to finalize the results. The criteria were as follows: (1) those who got both questions correct, wrote neatly, and cut and pasted according to the format were ranked A, totaling ten people; (2) those who got both questions correct, cut and pasted according to the format, but whose writing was not neat were ranked B, totaling twenty people; (3) those who were slightly off on both questions but whose writing was neat were ranked C, totaling thirty people; (4) the remaining forty were ranked D. The total number was exactly 100 people. Looking at the more than 7,000 application papers, I felt that there were several common drawbacks, which was regrettable! For example, the writing was sloppy and blurred, the cutting and pasting was either too large or too small, and the specified format was not followed, resulting in uneven and messy papers, losing their beauty. Finally, the 100 selected papers were trimmed, neatly bound, and put into order. This is the most easily overlooked aspect by most people, and it is the starting point for everything being off track. As the ancients said, "Without rules, there can be no circles or squares." In order to correct these habits, I cannot help but make a slightly demanding criticism here. I hope the readers will forgive me.

In addition, the China United Film Company and the Renhua Grand Theater both sent letters to certify the start and end dates of the initial release of "Mulan Joins the Army" and "Gone with the Wind," which gave me a guideline and I am very grateful. Due to the limited number of places, they also express their apologies to the majority of unsuccessful applicants!

### Qilin Tong to Perform a Short Engagement

— 星

After Shifting Customs Society’s Qilin Tong discontinued performing Bian Er Deng, half a year will soon pass. It was once widely rumored he would perform at the Great Shanghai Theater, but that was proven to be only a speculation by those who admire Qilin's art. Now, according to reliable sources, the Golden Grand Theater will invite Qilin Tong for a short engagement. If negotiations are successful, then he will immediately follow Meng Xiaodong's engagement. Given the Golden Theater’s resources in hiring northern actors, it is expected that Qilin Tong will accept even if he has relatively extravagant demands.

### Blood-Rain Qiong Hua

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 18: Vow to Sweep Away the Xiongnu Regardless of Personal Safety

San Gui read it once, then said to the envoy Xian Ting: "You wrote this letter very well. I have no choice but to beg for troops. After defeating the rebel, we can discuss matters further." He then sent Vice-General Yang Kun and Guerrilla General Guo Yunlong to deliver the letter and beg for troops. At that time, the Qing Dynasty's Regent Dorgon was leading the army as Grand General, seizing territory outside the Pass. Upon receiving Wu Sangui's letter begging for troops, he discussed with his civil and military officials whether or not to send troops to aid the Ming. Several civil officials, such as Grand Scholar Fan Wencheng, advocated denouncing the rebels and punishing the bandits, answering Sangui's request. "Troops move with righteousness, what achievement cannot be accomplished?" Dorgon himself also thought this was a good opportunity not to be missed, so he immediately wrote back to Sangui, agreeing to send troops. The letter contained phrases such as "In the past, Guan Zhong shot Duke Huan in the hook, but later Duke Huan used him as his minister, achieving hegemony. Now, if Bo Ruo leads his troops to return, he will surely be enfeoffed with his former territory and promoted to a princely rank, so that national revenge can be avenged and personal safety can be ensured." Thus, Dorgon's intentions can be imagined. After San Gui received Dorgon's reply, he sent another letter urging them to advance troops. This matter had already spread throughout the army. Zhang Cangqiu, upon hearing the news of the request for Qing troops, hurriedly went to see Xu Liu and Chen Fei, and they all gathered together for a discussion. Zhang Cangqiu spoke first, "You probably already know about General Wu's request for Qing troops. I don't think so at all. They are our dynasty's hereditary enemies, with the ambition of wolves – unpredictable. Our dynasty should strengthen its defenses to prevent Jianling. How can we ask them for troops to help us attack the rebels? This is no different from leading a wolf into the house, opening the door to invite thieves. What wisdom does General Wu have? Whoever advised General Wu to make this plan should have their head cut off! I must go see General Wu and advise him not to borrow Qing troops and bring enemies into the pass." (207)
