### The Resolution of the New Fourth Army Incident Should Be Extremely Cautious - The Ta Kung Pao's Stance

Chongqing: The Ta Kung Pao's editorial today, titled "On the New Fourth Army Incident," in addition to criticizing the army for disrupting the front line and attacking friendly forces, stated that the central government has been extremely lenient and tolerant. The feeling of our people is that after the Xi'an Incident, the Communist army was reorganized into the National Army, and the supreme command authority was established, which marked the completion of national unification. This unified structure was achieved after more than 20 years of civil war, with the shedding of countless blood and countless sacrifices. If there had been no such unified structure, we would not have been qualified to launch this war of national self-defense. The national command authority, which was obtained with such difficulty, must be resolutely upheld by all the people. The nation, which has already been unified, must not be allowed to be divided by all the people. However, from a political point of view, the New Fourth Army incident, this part of the army, although the original quality of this part of the army is slightly different, and only joined the National Army's combat sequence after the outbreak of the war of resistance, it is hoped that the General Staff Department will handle it carefully. Apart from rectifying military discipline, emotions should not be mixed in. We earnestly hope that Ye Ting himself can be granted leniency, and we earnestly hope that the central government will handle this issue with caution, so as not to cause any unnecessary complications and spread.

### Zhou Zhongyue Reports on the Administration of Yunnan Province, Progress Made in Various Facilities, Morale of the Yunnan Army Extremely High

Chongqing: Minister of the Interior Zhou Zhongyue recently returned to Chongqing after visiting disaster victims in Yunnan. On the morning of the 20th, he attended the Central Memorial Week and reported on the military and political facilities in Yunnan Province. Zhou first said that since Japan and France established an agreement, Japanese aircraft have raided Yunnan more frequently than before. The disaster victims have been relieved by the local government's allocation of funds and are deeply grateful. Next, he described military equipment, saying that the Japanese actions in Vietnam have not relaxed their ambition to invade China. The border defense of Yunnan Province is very important, and it has been completed in accordance with the central government's plan. The morale is extremely high. The military service facilities, which are closely related to military affairs, are also being actively promoted. He then described the political progress, divided into five items: civil administration, finance, economy, construction, and education. (1) In terms of civil administration, the implementation of the new county system began last year, abolishing the district system and expanding the township system. It was largely completed by the end of last year. There has been considerable success in accumulating grain and strictly prohibiting opium. (2) In terms of finance, the national and local revenue and expenditure have been divided, and a business tax has been implemented to supplement the lack of government expenses. The land has been cleared and production has been increased, and the acreage has almost doubled. New regulations have been formulated, land taxes have been collected, and surcharges have been canceled and graded taxes have been collected. As for local finance, in order to establish the foundation of county local finance, all county land taxes will be allocated to local administrative and business expenses, and all miscellaneous taxes will be canceled to reduce the burden on the people. The public treasury law is implemented, and county finances are gradually on track. In addition to providing various expenses, production businesses can also be organized within their capabilities. (3) In terms of economy, the province has set up many factories. The Fudian Bank has extended loans to farmers amounting to more than 20 million. There are also more than 20 other large investments in agriculture, industry, and mining. The stabilization of prices has shown considerable effect. (4) In terms of construction, a highway plan has been formulated, dividing the province's highways into three types: provincial highways, county highways, and village highways, with the main purpose of rushing to repair provincial highways and selecting county highways for repair. It has now been opened to traffic, with a route length of more than 3,000 kilometers, and another 3,000 kilometers are being planned to be rushed to repair. As for production matters, the development of water conservancy, the improvement of rice, wheat, tea, mulberry, cotton, and other plants have all been carried out separately and have been quite successful. (5) In terms of education, in order to adapt to wartime needs and to promote and improve the national education plan, it is required to be completed within a time limit. Wartime mass education has run 1,720 classes, accommodating more than 80,000 illiterate adults, and improving teachers' treatment. The expenses for enriching educational equipment and building libraries have reached 3 million yuan. There are also preferential measures for the education of chieftains. Zhou said at the end that, after nearly four years of war, the Japanese are deeply mired and unable to end it, and they often spread rumors. However, the military and civilians of Yunnan Province have an extraordinary determination to fight. After the war, Chairman Long swore to contribute all the manpower and material resources of the province to the country. In recent years, the training of troops and the purchase of guns have all been sent to the front. This is a fact that everyone has seen. Recently, a strict defense has been deployed on the Yunnan-Vietnam border, waiting for the opportunity to attack the Japanese. At this time, our country has a supreme commander who knows people and is good at assigning them, and military officers who are loyal to the country. No matter how the Japanese spread rumors, they can never destroy this kind of spiritual unity. Our country will surely be able to win the war. (Dispatch of the 21st)

Editorial

### The Evolution of American Policy

Future generations who study world history will certainly pay the most attention to the actions of the United States in this chapter on today. It is the current world center of gravity, and its recent actions and expressions are the factors that determine the current world development.

The basic policy of the United States has not changed, but the focus of its policy is moving forward. In other words, the previous focus was on "maintaining the dignity of treaties," and the current focus is on "firmly supporting freedom and democracy." There was a setback between these two: that is, in 1931, when Japan invaded and occupied the three northeastern provinces, British Foreign Secretary Simon refused to cooperate in sanctioning Japan. After that, through the highest point of the Munich Conference, until the outbreak of the European War, isolationists took advantage of the international counter-current and emphasized the protection of the Western Hemisphere, and did not intervene in any disputes in Europe. Even the extreme claim was to withdraw from the Far East at the same time and abandon the Philippine Islands. The slogan covering up this setback sang loudly: "Keep the United States from getting involved in the whirlpool of war!" And the psychology that formed this setback was, on the one hand, an extreme distrust of Britain's determination. On the other hand, it was a fundamental suspicion of the Soviet Union's intentions. This psychology was revealed at its peak when the European War broke out in 1939. The momentum of the isolationist faction at that time almost overwhelmed everything: people like Colonel Lindbergh, who openly spoke for Germany and Italy, actually touched the hearts of many people. The collapse of France also happened to coincide with the meeting. However, when President Roosevelt replied to French Prime Minister Reynaud's final appeal at that time, in addition to allowing his best efforts to support him, he had to solemnly declare: "Limited to not joining the war." It can be seen how painstaking Roosevelt was at that time!

However, after this setback, the United States finally moved forward bravely and brought out the brilliance of its basic policy. Originally, the United States based its international policy on the "Monroe Doctrine" of 1823; that is, the so-called "From now on, the Americas will no longer be the object of European colonization," prohibiting European powers from interfering in or intervening in the affairs of the Americas. From a certain angle, this should be regarded as a negative aspect, and should not be regarded as the whole picture of the United States' international policy. Because the Americas can never be isolated from the world. Its participation in the First World War was indeed for the United States and for the Americas. This is a clear and obvious truth. Therefore, the United States applied its policy to two treaties in the post-war international situation: one was the "Treaty of Versailles" in 1919, and the other was the "Kellogg-Briand Pact" in 1928. According to the treaty, it opposed the unilateral destruction of the status quo in violation of the treaty. According to the treaty, it also initiated various conferences to reduce armaments and peacefully resolve international disputes. Especially for Asia, it also initiated the "Nine-Power Treaty" in Washington in 1922. According to this treaty, it made every effort to uphold the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, adhered to the "Open Door Policy," and did not recognize territorial changes through violent aggression, which is the deduction of the Nine-Power Treaty. These three treaties are the active aspects of the United States' international policy; that is, the basic tone of "maintaining the dignity of treaties," on which the focus of the United States' national policy rests.

The United States' focus on "maintaining the dignity of treaties" as its policy will never change, but after the collapse of France, the American people, stimulated and taught by it, and threatened and endangered by it, were suddenly aware that it was not enough to merely maintain this focus, so they moved forward. The first step was to transport a large number of military equipment and weapons to Britain, and at the same time, it began to build up its own arms. The political form of this was that the isolationist faction naturally gradually declined, while hardliners Stimson and Knox and others joined forces to take up important positions. The US-Canada joint defense and the leasing of British bases also automatically assumed a part of the British Empire's defense. In fact, the object of this second step can be said to be entirely to do its best to assist Britain. By the time Germany, Italy, and Japan formally announced their alliance, it was proven that it was not enough for the United States to merely assist Britain alone. It was clear that the current problem for the United States was not to assist others; its inevitable reasoning and inevitable trend were as stated by former US Ambassador to France Bullitt in his speech on the relocation of the Tripartite Pact: "We can only have sufficient time to strengthen our national defense, and most of it depends on Britain resisting the Nazis in Europe. China resists Japan in Asia, and whether China and Britain can resist to the end depends on the degree and speed of our assistance." Under this understanding, there is its third step; that is, to carry out its planned large-scale assistance to both China and Britain at the same time. The opening of the Burma Road and the Anglo-American lending of large sums to China have appeared one after another. Step-by-step progress has its consistent significance; and the outline of its current stage is as clearly stated in Roosevelt's fireside chat at the end of the year: (1) Oppose the "new order" (2) Assist China and Britain, defeat Germany, Italy, and Japan, in order to avoid the scourge of war for the United States. (3) If necessary, the United States has the determination to fight. To sum up the outline and seek its focus, it lies in "firmly upholding freedom and democracy."

The activeness of American policy has now fully matured. It stands opposite the Tripartite Alliance in the majestic posture of a fully armed giant. Determined to crush Germany, Italy, and Japan's dream of dividing and controlling the world!

### Roosevelt's Third Inauguration: Washington Celebrates with Enthusiasm; Tens of Thousands Gather to Hear the President's Speech; Americans Devote Themselves to the Nation in the Face of Crisis

Washington—As Roosevelt donned the presidential robes for the third time, he delivered a speech stating that Americans are moving forward bravely and dedicating themselves to the nation in order to confront an unprecedented crisis. Roosevelt took the oath of office at 12:10 PM yesterday (1:10 AM this morning, Shanghai time) before Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court. Prior to the oath, he silently prayed at the historic St. John's Church at 10:40 AM, seeking divine guidance and praying for an early realization of peace. It is said that the seat where the President knelt was the same place where President Madison prayed in 1816. At the same time, no fewer than tens of thousands of people attended to hear the President's speech, and the streets were filled with enthusiastic onlookers. One million people reportedly participated in some part of the ceremony. As Roosevelt and his entourage entered the church, the crowd outside applauded and cheered. The President's car, protected by 50 motorcycles, entered the church after a small path was specially cleared to accommodate them. President Roosevelt left the White House at 11:30 AM, taking a route to the location where the ceremony was held. Meanwhile, foreign envoys also gathered there, adorned with gold and silver ornaments, and stepped onto the altar. German Consul Thomson, wearing a morning suit, arrived first with his wife. By noon, 100,000 spectators had gathered and cheered for the President's car. The naval band played "Hail to the Chief." Four army patrol cars, carrying machine guns, closely guarded the President's car. The President decided to make this inauguration ceremony simpler than previous ones because he insisted it must be so. The President also reviewed new mechanized and military equipment on the White House grandstand, with foreign representatives in attendance. A new feature of this decision was the aerial performance by the Navy, Army, and Marine Corps pilots. Students from West Point and Annapolis also participated in the regular military drills and parades, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery, all carrying the latest American mechanical equipment. (United Press, 21st)

Before the Oath: Praying for Peace

Washington—Before heading to the Capitol for the inauguration oath ceremony, President Roosevelt led his family into church to pray for world peace and American freedom. After the prayer, he returned to the White House in an open car, and soon after drove from the White House to the Capitol. He traveled along Pennsylvania Avenue, where flags were waving and the streets were lined with spectators. The 75,000 spectators lining the streets cheered like thunder. The President frequently waved his hat to the crowd. Those accompanying him included House Speaker Rayburn and Senate Republican Leader Barkley. The President's car was in the first position, followed by the First Lady's car, and then the car of former Vice President Garner and current Vice President Wallace and their wives. Police and secret detectives provided close protection along the way. Many people from all over the United States and Canada came to the American capital to witness the grand ceremony, numbering in the tens of thousands, so all the hotels were fully booked yesterday. Although the sun was shining brightly on this day, the cold wind was sharp, so most of the spectators wore heavy fur coats. A special grandstand was built in front of the Capitol, supported by white giant pillars. The President's mother and family were seated here to watch the ceremony. Preceding the President's car were a large number of policemen on motorized bicycles, and flanking the President's car were four military vehicles equipped with anti-aircraft guns and machine guns. The President and Vice President got out of the car, entered the hall, and stood bareheaded. Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court administered the oath. A few minutes after Wallace took the oath, Roosevelt took the oath of office amid cheers, and assumed the third term of the presidency. The time was 5:00 PM.

President's Speech: Broadcast Everywhere

The car rotated to address the crowd. Whenever the siren sounded, the crowd responded with applause. His speech was broadcast around the world via radio. After the speech, the national anthem was played, and the President and the crowd stood up. The oath ceremony was the same as previous inaugurations, but it had new significance due to the international situation. The most insightful words in the President's speech were: "The current danger is unprecedented. Our firm interest at this moment is to maintain the integrity of democracy and preserve it forever. To achieve this goal, we must unite the spirit and faith of the Americas to achieve it. We do not retreat, nor do we stand still. As Americans, we should follow the will of Heaven and move forward in the service of the nation to achieve success." The entire audience applauded unanimously upon hearing this. Observers said that the President's demeanor was more solemn than usual before taking the oath, and his tone was more impassioned when speaking, also different from the past. However, he was in high spirits when entertaining guests after the ceremony. The President said that maintaining the American spirit and faith is the highest reason why we are willing to make all kinds of sacrifices in national defense. If this spirit is lost, then even if the shell remains, America will have already perished. This kind of spirit, this kind of faith, speaks to us in our daily lives in a way that is not always noticed, and also speaks to us from other countries in the Western Hemisphere and from overseas countries that have been reduced to slavery and are still free. Sometimes we do not hear it, or we hear it but ignore it, because the privilege of our freedom has become commonplace to us, and we are unaware of it.

The Dignified Flame Must Be Maintained

When President Washington first took office in 1789, he spoke of maintaining the dignified flame of liberty and the republican system. If we lose this dignified flame now, or allow this flame to be extinguished by doubt, then wouldn't we be abandoning the future that President Washington painstakingly established? The American people renew their intention to dedicate themselves to America every time a President is inaugurated. Today, the national responsibility is to protect the country and its system from external disturbances. We must sometimes hesitate, reflect, and recall what our position is in history and consider what position we can have today and in the future in the face of rapidly changing times. If we do not, then we are committing the real danger of having no motivation to rise up. The life of a country is not determined by the calculation of years, but by the survival of the human spirit. The life of a person is seventy years, or more or less than that, but the life of a country is the fulfillment of its will to exist. Some people may doubt this, and some people may believe that a democratic system and way of life are limited by a mysterious fate, and that for incomprehensible reasons, autocracy and slavery will become the rising tide of the future, and freedom will become the receding tide. Know that we Americans all believe otherwise.

Democracy is Flourishing

Democracy has not diminished today, this is what we know, because we clearly see that democracy still exists and is flourishing. We know that it can never be destroyed, because democracy is created by the driving force of individual men and women united in a common cause, and this common cause is expressed by a free majority of the people. Democracy, alone among various political systems, can absorb the entire power of free will. Democracy has created an unlimited civilization that can continuously improve and advance human life. If we look beneath the surface, we will see that democracy is still prevalent on all continents, as it is the most humane, the most progressive, and the most unconquerable of all political systems in human society. Because of all this, we know that democracy will never perish. A country is like a person, with its own heart. This heart must know something and always be vigilant, and it must also understand the hopes and needs of its neighbors, because other countries must live together in this small world. A country, like a person, has something that is more profound, more eternal, and more magnificent than anything else. We now have something that is of the utmost importance to our future and that requires us to provide the most solemn protection to the current situation. It is difficult to include this thing in a simple term, and almost impossible, but none of us do not know what this thing is. This is the product of hundreds of years. The desire for democracy is not a recent development in human history, it is human history itself. It originated in the lives of ancient people, flourished in the Middle Ages, was recorded in the Magna Carta, continued to move forward without ever stopping, and is a constantly updated doctrine.

People Across America Praise the President

Washington—Yesterday, President Roosevelt stated in his inaugural address that he would dedicate his third term to defending democracy. Montana Democratic Senator Wheeler, a well-known advocate of non-interventionism, said, "I completely agree with everything the President said in his speech today. I will do my best to help him defend the democratic system and free institutions." New York Republican Fish said forcefully, "The President is working hard to maintain our current system against those who seek to destroy our system. I will support him with all my strength." Another advocate of non-interventionism, Kansas Republican Senator Kebert, said, "President Roosevelt is a great fighter for democracy, and he has proven it again today. People are generally uneasy about his joining the war, but I fully support his determination to maintain the democratic system." The President accepted his third term with his usual fortitude and cheerfulness. After attending a reception for governors and senior officials, the President gathered his family and friends at the White House to spend his evening. (International News Service, 21st)

His name is unknown, and he has been taken to the hospital for investigation. Later, he told the police that he was responsible for protecting the President. Another person was arrested for waving a sharp knife in the crowd of onlookers, also using protecting the President as an excuse. (Reuters, 21st)

### Air Defense Drills Held in Eastern US States; Four-Day Period, Confidential Situation

New York—The US Army and Air Defense Command held air raid and air defense drills at dawn today. The security was very tight, and even carefully selected journalists were unable to find out the details due to complete military inspections. The drills are scheduled for four days. The exercise is a hypothetical enemy air raid on the industrial center of the Northeast coast, while the defending forces provide protection. There are 10,000 civilian watchmen in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the part of New York State east of the Hudson River, forming a watch team. If they spot enemy aircraft in the sky, they will immediately report to the central military departments in Boston and New York. Based on these reports, fighter planes will take off to intercept the enemy aircraft. Army officials hope to see the shortcomings of the current air defense plan from this exercise. (International News Service, 21st)

### Military Commission Sends Personnel to Handle Inspection Matters

Chongqing—Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to unifying the national inspection work. In December of the 29th year [1940], he issued a hand order to the Supervision Office of the Transportation Control Bureau of the Military Commission, strictly limiting all provinces and regions to unify the national inspection work by the Supervision Office before February 1 of this year, in order to facilitate transportation and eliminate the evils of smuggling. After receiving the order, the Military Commission, in addition to announcing in major newspapers, specially appointed commissioners Chen Shijing and Liu Yan to lead soldiers and take several special cars to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, Yunnan, and other provinces to conduct on-site inspections and urge the handling of unified inspection matters. If there are any more violations of orders, or those who obey in appearance but disobey in reality, they will be immediately arrested and severely punished to rectify the inspection administration. It is reported that the two commissioners Chen and Liu are preparing to depart after receiving the order. (Telegraph, 21st)

### In the 76th Session of the Japanese Diet, Matsuoka Delivers a Diplomatic Speech; Seeks to Break the Deadlock Between Japan and the Soviet Union; Sharply Criticizes the United States' Far East Policy

Tokyo—At the opening of the 76th session of the Japanese Diet this morning, Foreign Minister Matsuoka gave a speech reviewing Japan's foreign policy in a comprehensive manner. He stated that Japan wanted to dispel misunderstandings with the Soviet Union, and "if possible," planned to make a fundamental adjustment to Japanese-Soviet relations with far-reaching impact. Matsuoka opposed the United States' policy in East Asia and expressed Japan's determination to stabilize the Far East. Matsuoka mentioned the Dutch East Indies, saying that the situation hindering the development of Japan's natural relations with the Dutch East Indies must be thoroughly remedied and good-neighborly relations obtained to promote mutual prosperity. Negotiations between Japan and Vietnam are proceeding in a friendly atmosphere. Regarding the dispute between Vietnam and Thailand, Matsuoka said that a movement has now been aroused among the Thai people to recover their former territories annexed by Vietnam. Matsuoka went on to mention Japan's renewed harmony with the Near East and South American countries, and reiterated that the Tripartite Pact was not intended to target any country, saying that the alliance aims at strong peaceful cooperation to establish a new world order. On this point, Matsuoka specifically stated that the pact was not directed against the Soviet Union, saying that in establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and ensuring peace in the East, it was inappropriate to let the current diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union take their own course. Therefore, we are making the greatest efforts to dispel mutual misunderstandings, and, if possible, to make a fundamental adjustment to diplomatic relations with far-reaching impact. At this time, Japan is negotiating with the Soviet Union on the delimitation of the border between Manchuria and Outer Mongolia, fishing, and Japan's concession rights in northern Sakhalin. Several of these outstanding issues are now on the way to being resolved. On this point, Germany and Italy are willing to agree with Japan, and Article 5 of the Tripartite Pact is also clarified to be in line with Japan's above-mentioned intentions. This pact is not directed against the Soviet Union. We sincerely hope that the Soviet Union will understand Japan's true intentions, and hope that the two countries will be moved by the spirit of mutual concession and goodwill, and complete the re-adjustment of the relations between the two countries." Matsuoka went on to mention the US policy, saying, "The United States has made it clear that it does not fully understand the proposal of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which is related to Japan's survival. The United States clearly holds the view that its own first line of defense extends eastward from the mid-Atlantic, but westward not only to the eastern Pacific, but also as far as China and the South Seas. If the United States can hold this attitude, then accusing Japan's hegemony in the western Pacific as a sign of Japan's ambition is at least a one-sided statement from the US side. I believe that the United States' taking this position cannot contribute to the promotion of world peace. Frankly speaking, for the sake of US-Japan friendship, for the sake of peace in the Pacific, and for the sake of general peace, I am very sorry for this attitude of the United States. I sincerely hope that a great power like the United States, which rationally uses its power, will understand its responsibility for maintaining peace, reflect deeply on its attitude with the true spirit of fearing God, and bravely liquidate the past situation, and make its greatest efforts to alleviate the crisis that civilization is about to encounter. The chaos in the current international situation has not diminished, but has intensified. If the United States is unfortunately dragged into the European war, and Japan is also forced to participate in the war, then another world war, in name and in fact, will break out and become a situation that all attempts cannot save. As the war intensifies and terrifying new weapons that have not been used before are used, no one can guarantee that it will not lead to a war that overturns modern civilization. The purpose of the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact is not only to strive to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but also to prevent the continued expansion of the current disputes during construction. We must strive to end the current war as soon as possible, and resolve the world's chaotic situation. At the same time, we must study and formulate precedents to prevent such disturbances from recurring in the future. The goal of the Tripartite Pact is to build a new world order. Given time, this goal will surely be achieved. There is no doubt that it will be a laborious and exhausting task. If the Japanese people are fully and firmly prepared for this task, then the Japanese Empire has a great and glorious future." (Reuters, 21st)

Tokyo—Prime Minister Konoe, in addressing the House of Peers, reiterated the seriousness of Japan's current domestic and foreign situation and called on the entire country to unite at this moment. After the Prime Minister finished his speech, Foreign Minister Matsuoka presented his foreign policy, followed by reports from the Army and Navy Ministers on the war situation in China. Then, a closed-door meeting was held, in which the ministers explained in detail the various difficulties facing the country. These remarks were again presented to the House of Representatives this afternoon, followed by a report from the Minister of Finance on the nation's finances. Then, the House also held a closed-door meeting. In his speech, the Prime Minister briefly outlined the government's domestic and foreign policies, and then seriously warned the two Houses that the Empire was encountering unprecedented difficulties in its history. He said, "We must develop the nation's strength to the highest degree internally in order to complete the national structure that emphasizes national defense, so that we can obtain sufficient military preparations to implement national policy. Externally, we must present a plan commensurate with the international development rights to announce the great development of our country's future." (Reuters, 21st)

Tokyo—Today's editorial in the Kokumin Shimbun stated that the most urgent task for the Diet to handle now is to deal with the American problem. It is now appropriate to postpone the discussion of domestic issues in order to solve the greater problem. The article mentioned the recent declaration of the United States, saying that we are now being insulted, threatened, vilified, and boldly challenged every day. It also recalled the hope to understand Japan in fifty years, saying that the United States now anticipates a crisis to occur within a few months. We cannot wait another fifty years. (Reuters, 21st)

### End of the German-Italian Summit: Spring Offensive Imminent; Mussolini Returns to Rome Yesterday Morning; British Increasingly Believe Germany Will Invade Southern Ireland

Berlin: Official sources refuse to release any information regarding the content of the talks between Hitler and Mussolini, only stating that the official communiqué has already outlined the topics discussed, which were limited to the current international situation. The location and timing of the meeting remain unknown. Authoritative sources refused to confirm the meeting before the official announcement, telling foreign reporters that, for military reasons, any news about the movements and meetings of important figures must be kept strictly confidential until the communiqué is released. Political observers here have not yet commented on the meeting between the two leaders. They only point out that previous meetings between the German and Italian leaders have often had far-reaching effects on the world situation. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 21st)

Rome: The Italian government announced the news of the meeting between Mussolini and Hitler at 7:15 last night, stating, "Premier Mussolini of Italy and Leader Hitler of Germany exchanged comprehensive views on the current world situation. The Foreign Ministers of Germany and Italy were also present. The talks proceeded in a spirit of friendship between the two leaders and the solidarity of the armed comrades of the German and Italian people. A complete consensus has been reached on various issues." This news will not be published in the Italian press until Thursday morning. The meeting was not entirely unexpected, as well-informed diplomatic and journalistic circles had earlier received news of Mussolini's departure. Three foreign journalists, including two Americans, had their telephone lines cut off by official order for releasing this information, as Italian practice dictates that important events are only announced after they have taken place. This meeting is of great significance for the future military actions of the Axis powers. The location of the meeting was not announced. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 21st)

Rome: Italian Premier Mussolini, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ciano and German Ambassador Mackensen, returned here at 10 o'clock this morning. The Italian Premier is returning to the capital after his meeting with Hitler. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 21st)

German-Italian Leaders' Secret Meeting: Discussing Control of the Mediterranean

London: Sources here now believe that the secret meeting between Hitler and Mussolini must have been to discuss the completion of the plan to drive Britain out of the Mediterranean or to assist Italy. Regarding German aid to Italy, such as the establishment of a large German air force base in Sicily and the arrival of countless German technicians in key Italian areas, these are all obvious. Well-informed sources here expect that these activities may continue to expand, and Hitler may concentrate a sufficient number of low-altitude bombers on Italian territory to carry out his even more ambitious task of preventing British fleets from sailing in the Mediterranean. Accompanying this German action will inevitably be greater activity by Italian submarines to attack British naval vessels and merchant ships. Parliamentarians close to the government say that the two dictators must also have discussed their hoped-for successful spring offensive plan. It is widely believed that Hitler will try to make Britain believe that he can launch an offensive on a vast and crucial front, starting from the Balkans, through the Mediterranean, and Spain, all the way to Ireland and the British Isles. He hopes that this extensive front-line attack will intimidate Britain into disbanding its army. They also say that reports of German plans to attack Ireland in the spring are now gaining credibility, and that the initial invasion may involve the landing of thousands of paratroopers far from the coast. They also believe that Hitler's main plan may be to establish a strong military presence in Ireland, to completely or partially disrupt British communications with the Americas, and to use Ireland as a base necessary for the final conquest of the British mainland. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

Berlin: High-ranking sources here predicted yesterday that an unprecedented multi-pronged offensive would follow closely on the heels of the Hitler-Mussolini meeting. This offensive aims to defeat Britain before the United States expands its aid to Britain. At the same time, knowledgeable sources made an important prediction that Britain will soon occupy Southern Ireland. The Urim Report, the capital city of Yugoslavia, acknowledges, "The Hitler-Mussolini meeting was the last meeting before the attack on Britain," and believes that French military representatives also attended the meeting. The German claim that Britain intends to occupy Southern Ireland is reminiscent of the same rhetoric used by Germany before Norway was occupied by Germany. Observers here believe that the German press reports that Britain is currently preparing to occupy Southern Ireland are a prelude to Germany's attack on the Free State of Ireland. (International News Service dispatch, 21st)

British Newspaper Discusses the Situation in Southeastern Europe: Germany Can Invade the Balkans at Any Time

London: The Times commented on the German-Italian summit, saying that it seems obvious that the Axis powers are now focusing their attention on Southeastern Europe. The offensive against Greece has demonstrated the unreliability of Mussolini's war machine. Hitler cannot risk launching an offensive in the Balkans without first consolidating his flanks. Now Hitler has seized key positions in Sicily and the Adriatic Sea, and can consolidate his flanks. Hitler now seems determined to wage war on two fronts simultaneously. The German General Staff has long considered fighting on two fronts to be inadvisable. However, Germany has now strengthened its military position and can advance into the Balkans when it decides to invade the Balkans. All sectors of Turkey are maintaining a silent trust and do not lightly believe in rumors of war breaking out soon. However, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia will bear the brunt of the Axis powers' threat. Bulgaria's steadfastness and friendship are currently beneficial to Yugoslavia, and the Greek resistance victory is also enough to sway hearts and minds, far from what the Romanian incident can compare. If the Axis powers truly intend to add troops to Yugoslavia, believing that they can drive straight in, then rashness would be extreme. The increase in the country's resources and the enhanced scope and efficiency of British military power are all essential factors in determining victory or defeat. These factors have now had a powerful impact on the balance of power in the Balkans. The United States' attention to the Balkans is also obvious. At this time, Colonel Donovan's visit can be seen as having special significance. The determination of Britain and the United States to defeat the Axis powers is an essential element in any assessment of the future of the Balkans, and a necessary condition for the future freedom of the Balkans.

### British Troops Deep into Eritrea, Advancing Towards the Red Sea; Simultaneously Advancing on Tobruk; Italian Troops Continue to Retreat in Gazala

Cairo: According to a dispatch from Sudan late yesterday, British troops have entered Italian Eritrea and are making satisfactory progress. It is estimated that the Italian troops retreating from Gazala number between 5,000 and 8,000, mostly indigenous troops commanded by Italian officers. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

Cairo: Battle reports state that two British columns, covered by the British Air Force, advanced deep into Eritrea yesterday, pushing towards the Red Sea and pursuing the fleeing Italian troops. The new British offensive has made progress due to the British occupation of Gazala and the capture of the fortresses of Saboterete and Taiseni. This offensive has threatened the northeastern corner and coastline of the Italian African Empire, causing a rupture in the Italian line. Large numbers of British troops immediately seized the opportunity to enter, "intending to make contact with the retreating enemy." The British Air Force also heavily bombed Italian bases and Italian mechanized units in Eritrea. (International News Service dispatch, 21st)

Cairo: Headquarters intelligence states that the retreat of Italian troops from Gazala, an important stronghold on the eastern front of British Egypt Sudan, continued yesterday. The intelligence stated that British troops continue to advance successfully on several fronts. The Royal Air Force on Sunday attacked the Italian strongholds of Biretro in central Algeria and Catania, an important seaport in Sicily, dropping high-explosive incendiary bombs on military concentration points and equipment transport ships. News from London states that military leaders estimate that Italian casualties in the Gazala area in the past six months were 2,000, while British losses were less than one-tenth. London believes that the recapture of Gazala is "a major defeat for Italy." (United Press dispatch, 21st)

Cairo: British headquarters here officially announced that British troops attacked Tobruk this morning, and the battle is currently proceeding satisfactorily. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### Italian-Greek War Situation

Athens: An official spokesperson stated that after the Greek army defeated the Italian army's "Wolf Division" in Albania, it occupied the central section of the defensive positions and captured several extremely important high grounds.

Athens: Two enemy planes attacked Piraeus in southern Greece yesterday and were both shot down. A small number of civilians were injured, and some refugee residences were destroyed. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

Athens: The Greek Ministry of Navy announced yesterday that an Italian submarine was destroyed by the Greek defensive submarine force in the Mediterranean. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

### US to Postpone Implementation of Freezing Deposits

New York: According to reliable sources on Wall Street, the US government does not intend to freeze foreign deposits in the US in the near future. This matter will depend on the future of the world situation. The Commercial Daily News stated that since Germany and the Soviet Union occupied several European countries last summer, the deposits of those countries in the United States have been frozen. Since then, there have been repeated informal discussions on the general issue of freezing, but they have all been opposed by the State Department. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

### Roosevelt's Envoy, Donovan, Arrives in Bulgarian Capital; Inspecting the Current Situation in the Balkan Peninsula; Soviet Union Denies Dismissal of Envoy to Bulgaria

Sofia: Colonel Donovan, US President Roosevelt's special envoy, told reporters yesterday after arriving here from Athens that he would stay in Sofia for several days to meet with officials and hoped to meet with Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov. People here are paying close attention to Donovan's trip due to the current situation in the Balkan Peninsula. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

Moscow: A Norwegian newspaper reported that "part or all of the personnel of the Soviet Embassy in Bulgaria have been dismissed for poor performance." TASS was recently authorized by the government to declare that this report is purely fabricated and does not correspond to the facts. (TASS dispatch, 21st)

### Laval Revolves from Germany; Set to Make a Comeback; Germany Hints He Must Be Given the Position of Foreign Minister; Rumor Has It That Hitler Carried a Letter to Pétain

(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the reconciliation between French Head of State General Pétain and former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, as claimed in the Vichy communiqué, seems to be the result of constant pressure from Germany, and may indicate a break in the "Pétain front." If Laval can clarify the "misunderstanding" that led to his sudden dismissal and imprisonment five weeks ago, then Germany will likely continue to pressure Laval to return to the cabinet. The Vichy government has not announced Laval's new position, but Berlin has hinted that Laval is the "Foreign Minister of the Florentin Cabinet." This likely means that Germany wants Laval to continue serving as Foreign Minister. Hitler waited for Pétain and Laval to have this "reconciliation" before meeting with Mussolini, because the task he plans to assign to France will have a major impact on the Axis powers' future plans in the Mediterranean. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

Painful History of the European War (8)

### Memories of Disorganized British and French Lines

He stood in front of the desk, head held high, hands in his pockets. After this farewell, I never met him again.

The next day, I was received by the military officers and found them more optimistic. They praised the morale of the French troops making deep deployments along the Somme and Aisne Rivers defense lines. They told me that General Weygand had decided not to construct a continuous defense line. If necessary, he would allow enemy tanks to break through the defense lines, but would firmly hold the strongholds on both sides to ensure that the enemy infantry and artillery could not follow the tanks. Unfortunately, our most elite divisions had been sacrificed in the battle in the north. Therefore, the strength of the new defense line was weaker than on May 10.

On June 2, 240 German aircraft bombed Paris. British Minister of Information Duff Cooper flew to Paris that day. The French Minister of Information, Frossard, had lunch with him, and I was also invited to accompany them. The location was the Ritz Hotel. Just as we were seated, the air raid siren suddenly sounded. The waiters恪守防空規則, and in an instant, they all hid in the cellar. At that time, the minister and his entourage were truly in a dilemma. It would be unheroic to hide, but it seemed undignified to do it themselves. They had no choice but to sit still, staring at the empty plates and listening to the incessant roar of artillery fire. The hateful German aircraft deliberately made things difficult, and the alarm was not lifted for a long time. They were hungry and their conversation became dull. A secretary called the police station to inquire and received a report that "the situation is very serious. The arsenal has been hit by bombs, the aviation department is on fire, and hundreds of people have been killed or injured."

When I returned home, the children were all vying to tell me that they had seen German aircraft flying high in the sky, like a swarm of bees, appearing and disappearing in the sunlight. Paris did not seem panicked by this bombing. Therefore, I came to the conclusion that the threat of German aircraft was not as terrible as the rumors suggested. The next day, news came that the German army had launched a new offensive along the Somme and Aisne Rivers front lines. British General Commander Gort and his subordinates had all withdrawn from France. At this time, I was reassigned to the British Air Force.

At this time, the British Air Force Command was located in the Wan Luoai area. I was received by Air Force Deputy Commander General Playfair. If you have seen more British Air Force officers, you will be surprised by how similar they look. They have handsome faces, blue eyes, and although their hair is graying, they still exude vigor. Their attitudes are gentle, their temperaments are resolute and decisive, their actions are courteous, and they strictly abide by discipline. These are all characteristics of the British Air Force.

General Playfair said to me, "Although the German Air Force outnumbers us, it is clearly inferior to us in terms of quality. Their losses are three to four times higher than ours, so the current situation is much better than at the beginning of the war."

Near Troyes, I saw two squadrons of British elite Hurricane aircraft and several young team members around 19 years old. They had brown hair, blue eyes, and each had a victory record of shooting down enemy aircraft more than ten times. Although the people and machines were excellent, I was still astonished by the small number of aircraft. Britain only had a few squadrons of aircraft in France, at least in the area I inspected. When I returned to Paris, the bad news that enemy mechanized troops had reached the outskirts of Rouen prompted me to express my feelings to my superior, Colonel Shiver, saying, "I think your country must still have a lot of fighters at home. We must send them to France. What will be decided at this moment is not only the fate of France, but also the fate of Britain!"

He replied, "You must go to England and call on the British people over the radio."

British public opinion is not yet fully aware of the perilous situation in France!

"Colonel, I would be very happy to go, but I must act on orders."

"I can speak to the command about this."

The commander sent Captain Hammond, and after some discussion with him, it was decided that I would fly to London by military aircraft on June 10. However, the military situation was becoming increasingly unfavorable. Finally, German tanks were directly approaching the outskirts of Paris. The government always said it would defend the capital to the death, but on June 9, I passed the naval department and saw sailors loading huge covered wagons.

At seven o'clock in the morning on June 10, Magilley called to advise me to send my family south.

I asked him, "Is the government moving the capital?"

"Today."

"Isn't Paris supposed to be defended to the death?"

"No longer."

At that time, I felt like a bolt from the blue, knowing that everything was over. France losing Paris was like a body without a head, and the war was doomed to failure.

I was supposed to arrive at the Brook airfield at noon. My wife and I decided to linger one last time in our favorite corner of Paris. We said goodbye to all the famous places. We felt that Paris had never been so beautiful: the sky was clear and cloudless, the air was gentle, and the traffic police on the road were directing vehicles as usual, as if the world was not coming to an end. The female salesclerks in the department stores were still cordially greeting customers. Although everyone's eyes contained a packet of hot tears, everyone was still doing their jobs as usual, never mentioning this great tragedy.

My wife said, "The French civilians are truly great! They are simple, brave, and have both. How can such people be defeated?"

I replied, "How can flesh and blood withstand machines? They are ordered to defend the front line, so they should obey the order to defend it, but the front line is under attack, and the enemy has outflanked them and surrounded them."

She said, "I still don't believe the German army will enter Paris..."

A few days earlier, our close friend, military doctor Martel, had discussed with us the matter of the German army entering Paris. He said to us, "I have made up my mind: as soon as I hear the news of the enemy entering the city, I will immediately draw my sword and commit suicide." Then he explained that most people do not know how to commit suicide, which results in being half-dead. However, military doctors use guns as skillfully as they use scalpels, always hitting the vital point without fail. He also half-jokingly said, "If you don't want to live either, I can take care of it..."

At ten o'clock that night, I had already flown to England. My wife was still looking worried, sorting out the miscellaneous items to carry with her, when suddenly the phone rang, causing her to stop.

The caller was Martel. He said, "I want to know if you and Mr. Mole are still in Paris."

She replied, "He has been ordered to fly to London, and I will leave Paris at dawn tomorrow."

His tone was somewhat strange, saying, "I am leaving, but the journey will be much farther than yours..." My wife suddenly remembered his conversation and knew that he was about to commit suicide, so she wanted to persuade him to change his mind. She said, "You still have many things you can do. Your patients, your assistants, your nurses, all need your care..."

Martel said, "I can't live any longer. I only had one son, who died in the last war. I have always comforted myself by believing that he sacrificed himself to save France. Now France is about to be lost again. Everything I have relied on to survive is about to leave me. I really can't live any longer."

As she was about to continue to persuade him, he hung up the phone.

Later, on June 25, the speedboat my wife was on stopped at Arcoa and read an American newspaper reporting that Martel had injected 　素 to commit suicide when the German army entered Paris.

Martel's death caused us to lose a confidant and France to lose its noblest figure. This military doctor was truly a gentleman. The money he had saved was used to maintain his free clinic, where countless people had been treated by him. I know that he had used his unique surgery to save an enemy who had been jealous and hateful of him for many years from death. He had shown hundreds of times the moral courage he possessed in body and mind. Such a warrior was unwilling to live a life of ignominious survival, which can also serve as a portrayal of the great misfortune and chaos caused by France's plight.

When the Allied forces were retreating along the Weimann Avenue from Flanders, a French farm woman witnessed the continuous passage of refugees at the door and said sadly to me:

"It's so pitiful, Captain! Such a great power..."

Afterwards, upon hearing the news of Martel's death, it was my turn to say "It's so pitiful." It would have been easy for France to manufacture or purchase five thousand tanks and ten thousand aircraft, but due to procrastination and failure to do so in time, such a person was allowed to hold a grudge in the netherworld, and such a culture was destroyed. Thinking of this, how can one not be filled with pain and anger? (The End)

### Taxpayers' Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow; Additional Tax Case to Be Debated; British and Japanese Nationals File Severe Amendments; All Parties Hope to Overturn the Original Motion for Additional Taxes

The special meeting of taxpayers in the Public Concession, convened by the leading consuls to discuss the special case of additional taxes, has been decided to be held tomorrow (Thursday) at 2:30 PM in the grandstand of the racetrack. At that time, the motion to increase the property tax by 40% and raise license fees, proposed by the Chairman of the Municipal Council, will be submitted to the meeting for discussion. After learning that the Municipal Council intends to increase taxes again, taxpayers inside and outside the concession were shocked by the unbearable burden and unanimously hoped that the meeting could be mindful of the people's strength and reject the additional tax motion to overcome the difficult times. This is especially true for the Chinese.

British and Japanese Nationals Propose Amendments

On the British national side, Li Dell proposed and Arlington seconded that the Municipal Council be asked to reassess the tax rates on landowners' self-used properties and undeveloped land within the concession in order to reduce the burden on middle and lower-class taxpayers. It is said that all parties sympathize with this suggestion. On the Japanese national taxpayer side, it is said that an opposition motion has also been passed, proposed by Lin Xiongji (Chairman of the Japanese National Taxpayers' Association and Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Street Federation) and seconded by Fukuda, asking the meeting to request the Municipal Council to accept the Japanese amendment, abandoning the original motion to increase the current amount of municipal general tax and land tax by 40%, and replacing it with the following suggestion, "The Municipal Council should continue to implement reductions and reforms, and fundamentally study the possibility of reforming the current taxation system. The proportion of tax payments should be determined according to the ability of each citizen instead of the current system of obtaining most of the tax revenue from land tax and municipal taxes, so that the taxation system is fairer. Until such a system can be realized, the financial shortfall should be made up by borrowing."

Chairman Explains Financial Situation

Chairman Keeswick has now prepared a lengthy speech, clarifying the real difficulties in reducing expenditures for various administrations within the concession, and that the council's recent increase in living allowances has put the council's finances in an even more difficult situation, so it is necessary to increase taxes and appeal to taxpayers to pass it. However, the number of Japanese nationals at this meeting is quite large, and the future is still difficult to predict.

### 名女作家　史特朗　過滬返美

Miss Anna Louis Strong, a famous American female writer, was the most eye-catching of the passengers on the Tahutu President, which arrived in Shanghai last night. Ms. Strong recently traveled from Chongqing to Hong Kong, then took this ship via Shanghai back to the United States. While in Chongqing, she paid respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and senior officials of the Chinese government. According to her, the trip to Chongqing left her with a deep impression. The spirit of the Chinese soldiers and civilians is exceptionally vigorous. In fact, 99% of the Chinese people are making every effort to fight to the end.

This spirit will surely enable China to achieve final victory. Ms. Strong has visited China many times to conduct research. Using the materials she collected in China, she wrote two books, "Four Hundred Million Customers" and "One-Fifth of Mankind". Before going to Chongqing, she traveled in the Soviet Union for a long time. She said that the Soviet Union has prepared all measures to deal with contingencies, but strives for neutrality and does not want to participate in the European war. However, regarding the war in the Far East, the Soviet Union is already supporting China.

Japan's attempt to use a non-aggression pact as bait to induce the Soviet Union to stop providing China with various munitions and raw materials is entirely wishful thinking. After all, the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union is completely different from that between Japan and the Soviet Union. According to Ms. Strong's observation, the current friendship between China and the Soviet Union is as solid as that between China and Britain and the United States. Japan's situation is now very critical, because it is surrounded by China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. If it does not pull back from the brink and quickly change its foreign policy, its future is worrying.

Ms. Strong went to Germany for investigation in June last year, stayed in Germany for several weeks, then went to Moscow, stayed in the Soviet Union for several months, and then went to Chongqing. Her footprints spread across Europe and Asia, so she is familiar with the general situation. The above observations are based on practical experience, indicating the favorable international situation of China and the bright future of the war. Ms. Strong will stay in Shanghai for one day and night, and is scheduled to take the original ship back to the United States at 6:30 this afternoon, first inspect in San Francisco, and then go to Washington DC.

### 自滬赴甬流動商人　應懲收營業稅

Mobile merchants traveling from Shanghai to various parts of eastern Zhejiang are increasing daily. The Ningbo Business Tax Collection Bureau, in view of this, believes that this temporary business tax should be collected in accordance with regulations to benefit tax sources. In order to adapt to the facts, the import and export measures will be re-determined to facilitate adaptation.

### 美商會發強烈呼籲　協助美國商團　在上海現存緊急狀況下　美商團之職責異常重大

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai issued a strong appeal today (the 21st), addressed to the managers of various American business firms and American merchants, requesting that all American expatriates assist in establishing the American team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The article stated that American expatriates should have a deeper understanding of the importance of the service of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, especially under the current emergency situation in Shanghai. The patrol mission of the "B" defense zone in the Public Concession makes the responsibilities of the Volunteer Corps increasingly heavy. Even without considering this, in a better situation, the service of the Volunteer Corps is very familiar to the young people of the American expatriate community in Shanghai. However, American business owners have not cooperated with employees who want to take leave to work for the Volunteer Corps, and have even refused to grant them permission. The reason why business owners do not encourage their employees must be entirely due to their ignorance of the value of the Volunteer Corps' service.

### 廣慈醫院職工　昨晚全體復工　九家出差汽車司機提要求　商務同人昨午休息一小時

Guangci Hospital, located at 197 Jin Shenfu Road, was founded two years before the founding of the Republic of China by Catholic priests and is directly under the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church on Tianzhutang Street, Yangjingbang. It is deeply trusted by all walks of life. It has more than ten staff members, more than one hundred and fifty male workers, more than one hundred female workers, five foreign doctors, and more than 20 Chinese doctors, with more than 1,200 beds. Since the labor side asked for improved treatment on the 30th of last month, but was not invited to be approved, it was forced to leave the hospital. The two sides have been in a stalemate for 22 days. The labor side has been running around and appealing, suffering a lot. Now, at 4 pm yesterday, all employees formally resumed work.

Conditions for resumption of work at Guangci

It is learned that the hospital has agreed to the eight conditions proposed by the labor side: (1) All employees resume work; (2) Wages during the strike period are paid as usual; (3) The minimum wage is increased by 15 yuan across the board; (4) Employees shall not be dismissed without cause. Other conditions will be negotiated openly. The labor side is satisfied, so all employees formally resumed work yesterday.

Requests from Car Drivers

All drivers from nine Class A car companies in this city, including Yitai, Benning, Sichuan, Meihua, Jiangsu, Kade, Dakang, Zhonghua, and Fuzhou, have jointly submitted a request to the capital side on the 16th of this month, because their monthly wages are only between 20 and 40 yuan, which is difficult to maintain in this time of high prices: (1) Increase wages by 75% to 100%; (2) Increase rice subsidy by 10 to 20 yuan; (3) Living allowance of 75%; (4) Annual bonus of three months. They also negotiated with the capital side once the day before yesterday, but there was no result because the capital side rejected the request. Now the labor side has decided to hold a joint conference this morning to discuss solutions and urge the capital side to respond as soon as possible in order to maintain the spirit of cooperation between labor and capital.

Commercial Temporary Break

The colleagues' association of the Commercial Press held a one-hour break from 10 am to 11 am yesterday to protest the authorities' issuance of dismissal, non-renewal, and transfer measures. At that time, all departments' operations were suspended. Wooden signs explaining the reasons were placed at the entrance and inside the hall, and declarations were distributed. The order was good. Operations resumed after 11 am. According to the representative of the colleagues' association, their purpose is only to urge the authorities to cancel the three measures of dismissal, etc., and to improve the lives of colleagues, and are willing to resolve the matter through reasonable procedures so as not to allow any party to take advantage of the situation. It is now decided to wait quietly for the authorities to respond in the short term.

International Hotel Dispute

The labor-capital dispute at the International Hotel, located at 164 Jing'an Temple Road in this city, was once openly negotiated by representatives from both sides the day before yesterday afternoon, but no satisfactory agreement was reached. Yesterday afternoon at 3 pm, negotiations continued, and the capital side gave a copy of the speech draft as a response to the main points. The labor side unanimously opposed it, leading to a breakdown in negotiations. Yesterday, according to a responsible person from the store, they decided to wait for a peaceful resolution and planned not to take any out-of-bounds actions, so they hoped that the capital side would properly mediate to avoid the expansion of the situation.

Paint Industry Petitioned Yesterday

Since the paint workers in this city went on strike on the evening of the 18th, there have been no major conflicts. However, the capital side has still not made any expression of resolution. The strike is still continuing. Yesterday afternoon, the workers in the industry petitioned various capital sides separately, begging them to understand the workers' pain and give them increased wages for meals in order to maintain their livelihood, and hoping to resolve the matter as soon as possible, and appealed to all walks of life.

### 法公董局決　嚴峻遏制物價　俟法總領署核準即實行

According to the "Shanghai Times", yesterday (the 20th), it was learned that the prices of various commodities in this city have repeatedly soared, reaching new heights. The French Concession Public Works Bureau is planning to take strict new measures to curb the unreasonable rise in the selling price of basic foods. The Price Investigation Committee of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, after several weeks of close study, has drafted several recommendations for controlling selling prices, which will be submitted to the French Consulate General for research. Once approved, the Public Works Bureau will implement restrictions on rising prices. The items whose selling prices will be controlled include thirty kinds of food, such as rice, flour, coal briquettes, firewood, charcoal, oil, and food.

Flat Price Flour Being Negotiated

Last year, the Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills provided flat-price flour, which benefited the general real users not shallowly. The authorities expressed great admiration. Regarding the matter of selling flour at a flat price this year, as a result of negotiations between the authorities and the factory, each package of factory stock is 21 yuan and 50 cents. Fuxin supplies 3,100 packages every day, and Fufeng supplies 1,059 packages. However, this method is limited to January 6 to 25 (excluding Sundays). As for the flour price and quantity during the Lunar New Year, although the authorities and Fuxin Factory and others are negotiating, they have not yet been finalized. In the blink of an eye, the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the supply of flour from the two factories will inevitably stop for many days at that time. It is hoped that general users will purchase as soon as possible before the New Year to meet their needs and prepare. In addition, the machine-made noodles industry presented a request to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, requesting the sale of flat flour from the border area so that the civilians in the border area can also get flat-price noodles.

Seven Hundred Thousand Bags of Foreign Rice Will Arrive

Yesterday, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired about the rice industry in this city and learned that from the middle of February to the end of March this year, a large batch of foreign rice produced in Saigon, Siam, Yangon, and other places will be shipped, totaling more than 700,000 bags. Namely, British merchant Heyi Foreign Company's February shipment of 1,000 tons, priced at 90 yuan and 2 cents; Jinhua's late January Xiaowen rice 500 tons at 83 yuan, and another 500 tons at 81 yuan; February 1st grade rice 500 tons at 92 yuan; Ding Taihua Company's February price 1st grade rice 2,000 tons at 93 yuan, etc. The above prices are all prices that have been traded in the market, and their arrival prices are still quite low. The Rice and Bean Industry Association decided that: (1) The commission charged by the industry (including rice shops, merchants, etc.) for each stone of rice (domestic rice and foreign rice) shall not exceed 50 cents.

### 朱慶瀾功在國家　呈請國葬

After the death of the late member of the Zhenji Committee, Zhu Qinglan, some time ago in Xi'an, the National Government issued an order of commendation and gave funeral expenses of 5,000 yuan. Yesterday, Zhu's family here received a telegram from Shaanxi, stating that the chairman of Shaanxi, Jiang Dingwen, and military authorities such as Hu Zongnan, jointly submitted a request to the Central Government to grant Zhu a state funeral, because Zhu had made contributions to the country.

### 虹口日僑　禁讀反日報紙

Punishment for those who read without permission. English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" Under Attack The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the Japanese-language "Continental News" in this city has repeatedly issued "malicious words" against the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury". Recently, it published an article titled "Newspaper Fashion", criticizing the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" and two English-language morning papers for being anti-Japanese, stating that Japanese expatriates in Hongkou read English-language newspapers

is an unpatriotic and "purely fashionable" act. The Japanese military authorities in this city will take strict measures on this and closely monitor any Japanese expatriate who reads anti-Japanese English-language newspapers without official permission, and punish them severely. The delivery of anti-Japanese English-language and Chinese-language newspapers to Hongkou has "automatically stopped." In the future, only those who work in the newspaper industry or civil servants can subscribe to these after obtaining permission from the military authorities.

Anti-Japanese Newspapers

Many Japanese expatriates read these newspapers purely out of fashion, and discard them in public places such as trams and buses after reading them, which will have a bad impact on Chinese and Japanese expatriates in Hongkou. However, it is believed that the Japanese military circles here today (the 21st) have not imposed any prohibition on the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury". It is said that English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" is still freely sold at newsstands in Hongkou.

### 美經濟凍結政策　日將遭受威脅　不特喪失外滙購貨資源　對中立國家亦無法貿易

Regarding the section of the draft plan of the US Treasury Department to freeze the funds of the Axis powers in the United States, which can be implemented after President Roosevelt approves it, I once asked an economist in this port about the impact of this matter. According to him, most of the world's materials are within the scope of the US dollar and the British pound. The United Kingdom has vast colonies and abundant resources. The United States ranks first in the world in terms of industrial production, agricultural production, and mining production. Since the outbreak of the European war, the exchange rate of the British pound has fluctuated, and import and export trade has also been controlled. As a result, the foreign trade of various countries in the world has concentrated in the United States, and the US dollar has become the only free currency in the world. The settlement of international trade is based on the US dollar, so many countries transport their gold to the United States and see it as US dollars, which are used as foreign funds to balance their own currency exchange rates and purchase US industrial products. If the United States gives economic blows to the invading countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan and freezes their funds in the United States, the Axis powers will not only lose their sources of foreign exchange and materials, but also their trade with neutral countries will be hit. For example, if Japan wants to purchase wheat from Argentina and cotton from Brazil, it must use US dollars, because those countries are unwilling to accept Japanese yen. After all, the Japanese yen group has no important position and effect in the world currency market in reality. At this point, if Japan wants to maintain trade with neutral countries, there is only the way of bartering goods. Freezing funds is just one aspect of the United States' dealing with invading countries. In the future, there will inevitably be other economic sanctions to accompany it. Japan's foreign trade now completely relies on the United States. The pressure of the US economy will have a very significant impact on Japan. According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", according to an article by an economist Arles in this port, yesterday (Tuesday) noon, another telegram came saying that Wall Street in New York believed that the US government would not close foreign deposits in the short term, and the matter returned to calm. But it can also be said that it was only slightly delayed. It has been rumored for two months that the funds deposited in the United States by Shanghai banks are being frozen, and it is not entirely without basis. In a certain period, Song Ziwen did discuss this matter seriously with US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. According to his plan, anyone in Shanghai who has US currency deposited in any country's bank will not be allowed to withdraw money unless they have been specially approved by the US government to be granted a license. The purpose is to eliminate speculation and prevent the devaluation of legal tender.

### 商民宜自行戒備　保護財物　帶款須格外留意　防盜匪跟踪刦掠

The Public Concession police authorities hope that Chinese merchants and residents within the concession will assist the authorities during this period, take precautions on their own, and protect their property to avoid robberies. When transporting large amounts of money, be especially careful. It is reported that thieves are often paying attention outside the bank. When they see people taking money out, they will follow them to a secluded place and rob them of their property. Now is the final accounting period, and precautions should be taken.

### 美僑婦女製繃帶　餽贈英軍

American women work very excitedly, and women from various countries also join. According to Dalu News, yesterday (the 20th), it was learned that the American Women's Work Association in this city has an "American Studio" located at 9 Jia'erye Road in the French Concession, which produces 2,000 rolls of bandages every month, as well as arm sling bandages, "T"-shaped bandages, and multi-tail bandages, 400 pieces each, and donates them to the British army. It is reported that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once used this studio as a bedroom, and then Mrs. Heilmich, the American Attorney General in China, donated it to the American Women's Work Association. The association was originally organized by many American women, but now many foreign women in Shanghai have also joined as members, and many of the original members have left Shanghai during the American evacuation. The number of members once decreased to five women, but there are many other American and other foreign women who are very interested in this, so the number of members has now increased to 35. They purchase materials from the British Women's Public Association on a regular basis, make them into bandages, and return them to the British Women's Public Association.

Shipping to London and Singapore, the British Women's Public Association has also proposed to provide the materials themselves, and the American Women's Work Association only needs to make them into bandages. However, the American Women's Work Association hopes to fund the purchase of materials, and it is still the same. Although the monthly cost has increased from 200 yuan to 800 yuan, it has not changed its original intention. However, the number of bandages produced by the work association is increasing day by day, and the expenses are all borne by the members, so it has appealed to the American expatriates in this city for donations. The work association was established last spring and plans to continue working until it is no longer needed. Women who join the association go to the studio from 2 pm to 5 pm every Sunday to collect materials and return to their residences to make bandages.

### 電車加價已準備　盼速制止

Since the British-owned tram company in the Public Concession, on the pretext of foreign exchange relations, has been approved by the Public Works Bureau to re-implement price increases from the 26th of this month, that is, the Lunar New Year's Eve, the company has now rushed to print a large number of newly revised fare lists for each route, which will be posted in the carriages of various lines of trams and trolleybuses. However, the public in this port believes that the residents' burden has already been heavy due to the repeated price increases of trams after the war, so they very much hope that the company will still actively rectify its business and stop the events of taking kickbacks and corruption in order to increase revenue and reduce fares, so as to reduce the burden on residents.

### 舊歷元旦浦江高潮

According to the prediction of the Junpu General Bureau, there will be a high tide in the Huangpu River on the 27th of this month (that is, the Lunar New Year's Day), and its quantity will reach 10 feet and 005 points. The starting time is around 1 pm. If there is wind and rain, the roads will see the tide surge up.

### 工部局一年來重要行政概述（四）

Rickshaw Rental

In January of last year, according to the request of the Rickshaw Industry Association for permission to increase rickshaw rental in order to maintain it, after detailed consideration, it was decided to increase the rickshaw rental from 7.7 cents to 8.3 cents per day from February 1. At the same time, the minimum amount of rickshaw fare was increased from 8 cents to 1 dime. In June, the Bureau established a special rickshaw subcommittee to conduct a comprehensive study of the current situation of the rickshaw industry in this port. From July 20, the rickshaw rental was increased again by 1.5 dimes per day. From July, the subsidy to the rickshaw drivers' mutual aid association was approved to be increased by 5 dimes per month per rickshaw, and at the same time, the citizens were urged to understand the lives of rickshaw drivers and appropriately increase rickshaw fares so that rickshaw drivers could cope with the higher rickshaw rentals.

Increase in Tuition Fees

It was found that the expenses of the schools established by the Bureau have increased sharply due to high prices, so a surcharge of 25% on the tuition fees of various Western children's schools has been collected since September of the year before last, and a surcharge of 15% on the tuition fees of various Chinese children's schools has been collected since the spring of last year. Later, the prices of goods continued to rise, and the expenses of various schools increased even more, so the Bureau approved the Education Committee's recommendation and raised the surcharge on various Western children's schools to 75% from September of last year. At the same time, the tuition fee of Nie Zhongcheng Public School was increased from 40 yuan to 55 yuan per semester, and the tuition fees of the other four Chinese children's public schools were increased from 48 yuan to 65 yuan. In addition, the tuition fees of various Chinese children's primary schools were generally increased by about 50%.

Refugee Problem

At the beginning of last year, there were a total of 28 shelters in the concession, accommodating a total of 33,000 refugees. By the end of the year, the number of shelters had been reduced to 13, and the number of refugees had been reduced to 15,000, so the refugee problem has been greatly improved. The entertainment donations collected by the Bureau from various theaters were allocated to various Chinese and foreign charitable organizations as funding for charitable undertakings. The problem of completely stopping the shelters is still difficult. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Salvation Army, various fellow villager associations, and other charitable organizations have made many contributions to the relief of refugees, which is commendable.

Beggar Accommodation

It was found that accommodating beggars is a major problem, and the Bureau has always paid attention to it. At the annual meeting of taxpayers last year, the Bureau expressed its plan to set up a beggar shelter in order to completely solve the problem of beggars in the concession. The purpose of setting up a beggar shelter is to enable beggars to support themselves and to support them for a long time, allowing this beggar group to exist forever. At the same time, it is hoped that the number of beggars in the concession will gradually decrease. As for the expenses of the shelter, it was initially estimated at 175,000 yuan per year, but later prices rose sharply, and this number will inevitably increase. It was found that the Bureau's financial income is limited by precedent and cannot be transferred to be used for the relief of the poor, so this type of expenses must be given to public donations. It has been clearly explained in the previous article that the Salvation Army is willing to undertake the implementation of beggar relief work. At the same time, the Shanghai Rotary Club is generous in taking the disposal of the beggar problem as its own responsibility and agrees to set up a committee to handle the receipt and distribution of donations, which is commendable. (End)

### Woman Beats Her Child to Death: Six-Year-Old Boy Severely Abused; Woman Detained for Homicide

Xu Jiangshi, a woman from Ningbo, currently 35 years old, residing at No. 52, Lane 498, Huade Road, Hongkou, is accused of repeatedly abusing her six-year-old son, Qianqin, since he came to Shanghai from Ningbo last October.

According to a statement released by the Public Works Department, the curfew will be strictly enforced as usual on New Year's Eve of the abolished calendar. To ensure tight security, all public places are instructed to close by 12:30 AM on the day.

### Finance: Exchange Rate Fluctuations Unstable; Yesterday's Afternoon Market Tightens Again

The exchange rate market yesterday showed no change in HSBC's listed rates. The black market for British and American currencies was volatile, and operators found it difficult to predict future changes. Speculative activity was mixed today, initially indicating a loosening, with the spot US dollar trading at 5.53125 yuan and the February US dollar at 5.4675 yuan. However, upon hearing news that the US was delaying the implementation of the frozen assets of Axis countries, sentiment temporarily turned bullish, and people shifted from selling to buying. In the afternoon, speculative demand remained high, but foreign banks like the Daybank were willing to sell, albeit slightly. As a result, the spot British exchange rate closed unchanged and the US rate narrowed by 0.03125, with the spot British exchange rate at 3 pence 4.0625 and the US dollar at 5.40625 yuan.

Morning Market Marked by Heavy Selling

The morning market started with London large contracts, both near and far term, unchanged. The New York silver price also remained unchanged, and the London gold price was fixed. Exchange rates between Britain and Shanghai remained unchanged, with the US dollar appreciating slightly against the pound by 0.025, but unchanged against Shanghai. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3 pence 4.375 for British gold and 5.4375 yuan for the US dollar, with the US dollar unchanged and the pound appreciating by 0.03125 compared to the closing price the previous night. This was due to a slight appreciation of the US dollar against the pound. After opening, speculators were mostly on the selling side, dumping a significant amount of near and far term US dollars, causing prices to loosen. It was reported that a speculator and an American bank sold February US dollars at 5.46875 yuan. At 9:30 AM, HSBC's listed rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver tax remained unchanged. Later, a few speculators recovered, and the US dollar market rebounded slightly. Internal and external banks were reported to have quoted 5.4375 yuan for February contracts. By noon, with speculators continuing to buy, and although foreign banks continued to supply as before, prices gradually softened. Foreign banks were selling US dollars for the current month to Chinese speculators at 5.4375 yuan. The noon closing price was 3 pence 4.375 for British currency and 5.4375 yuan for the US dollar, the same as the morning opening price.

American Banks Buying, Market Tightens

The afternoon market initially heard of the Central Bank's profit and Japanese merchants' sales, and although speculators continued to sell, prices remained stable. Speculators were reported to have bought current month US dollars at 5.4375 yuan. Later, with American banks also buying, the market was affected and softened. A Sino-Belgian bank was reported to have sold US dollars for the same month to a certain American bank, falling to 5.40625 yuan. There were no changes before the evening closing, with spot and current month British currency closing at 3 pence 4.0625 and the US dollar at 5.40625 yuan, and the following month British currency at 3 pence 3.75 and the US dollar at 5.375 yuan.

### Cash Absorbed Again; Breaks Through 6,700 Yuan Barrier

Yesterday's gold market saw unstable fluctuations in the gold bullion black market, twisting and turning before rising again. Prices have broken through the 6,700 yuan barrier. It is said that due to a certain communication, the US freezing of Axis assets in the US is not easy to implement immediately. Furthermore, the "Central Reserve Bank" came to absorb the market. The Shanghai gang, who had recently established short positions, suddenly rushed to cover, so even though the Dasheng, Xinfeng, Rencheng, Yong, and draft merchants were strongly selling, they could only balance the market with the Xinyuan, Tianyuan, Dadecheng, Hengji, and Hecheng firms buying. The monetary situation retreated twice to 6,605 yuan, before rising again. In the afternoon, there were even more bullish rumors, and securities firms such as Tong Kang Defu also came to compete to buy. The market opened already flying to 6,700 yuan, and then rose further, reaching 6,735 yuan, eventually closing at 6,723 yuan, up 83 yuan. Based on the February US dollar closing price of 5.375 yuan, the gold price was 6,500 yuan, an increase of 223 yuan. The total daily trading volume was 15,000 taels. Swapping from January to February, buyers were giving approximately 210 yuan to sellers. The price difference between cash and futures contracts narrowed sharply. In the morning, Dacheng sold 70 taels, 30 yuan lower than the futures price. In the afternoon, money changers sold 30 taels, 29 yuan lower. Xiang He bought Shengyuan Yong for 40 taels, only 5 yuan lower, as it was heard that a certain bank was secretly collecting, and those with funds were also rushing to hoard. Gold jewelry rose by 20 yuan to 690 yuan, while Guan Jin and other currencies remained unchanged.

Gold Bullion Recovers Quickly

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially trended flat, at 9:15 AM, the market price was heard to be 6,630 yuan, 10 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. Small money changers and retail investors sold, pushing it down to around 6,610 yuan. Xinyuan, Hesheng, Yili, Tianyuan, and Chengji suddenly came to buy, with talk that Shanghai short-sellers were covering. The price then flew up by over 80 yuan, rising to 6,695 yuan. Rencheng Yong, Dafeng, and Xinfeng draft merchants suddenly came to sell, with retail investors also following suit, causing an immediate reaction and falling by 90 yuan, twice falling to 6,605 yuan. The gold store Chengji then began to absorb again, and the short side covered, pushing it up to 6,665 yuan. Draft merchants then sold again, falling to 6,630 yuan, before rising again. The noon closing price was 6,647 yuan. In the afternoon, there was suddenly news that the "Central Reserve Bank" came to absorb, and Shanghai short-sellers were even more eager to cover. Sellers dared not release their holdings, and the price flew up to above 6,700 yuan. The opening price at 2:00 PM had already risen to 6,720 yuan, 73 yuan higher than the noon closing. Xiang He, Tong Kang, and Chengji further advanced to 6,725 yuan, but the foreign exchange rate remained stable. Jinyuan, Yiyuan, and Dafeng retail investors scrambled to sell, and an immediate collapse was seen to 6,660 yuan. It was heard that the next month's US dollar could not be settled at 5.40625 yuan. Hesheng, Xinfeng, Tong Kang Defu, Hengji, Xinyuan, and others fiercely advanced, frantically covering their short positions, once again flying up by 75 yuan, seeing a high price of 6,735 yuan. Not long after, the market closed at 6,723 yuan, a recovery of 83 yuan compared to the previous evening's closing price. There was a fluctuation of 130 yuan throughout the day. The closing price was 6,715 yuan. The selling price of wooden brand gold in cash stores was initially flat with the gold bullion futures price, but ultimately had to be 10 yuan higher. The buying price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. The current spot price remained unchanged without a price.

Jewelry Gold Listed High at 90 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry and ornaments in gold stores, per tael, was initially listed at 670 yuan by Datong Hang and Xin Tonghang. It rose by 10 yuan at 10:00 AM, and then rose by another 10 yuan at 4:00 PM, reaching 690 yuan (the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan).

### British and American Currencies Rebound

British gold notes remained fixed, and the market price was stable.

Hong Kong notes rebounded by 0.02 yuan. The supply of Japanese and Korean gold notes suddenly increased, and market prices weakened. The former retreated to 1.57 yuan, and the latter fell to 1.215 yuan.

### Securities: After a Big Rise, Public Bonds Fall Sharply; The More They Rise, the More They Fall

The black market for public bonds saw a small rebound in the morning yesterday, due to a sudden rise in rumors. This was followed by a downward trend in the afternoon, which became increasingly severe. After a big rise, the fall was equally drastic. This often happens when the interest payment date approaches. It is said that the Hong Kong gang was selling, and the long positions held by Ding Kang and others were uncertain. With the Lunar New Year approaching, one sale led to a hundred sales, especially for Category A bonds, which fell by 4.435 yuan, the most significant decline. Yesterday, the long positions were slightly reduced in the morning, but Tong Kang was still buying. Tong Shun and Xinfu both absorbed, while Lianxiang, Dafeng, Dahua, and Shunfeng sold. The market price rose slightly. The noon closing was slightly less than 0.5 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly emerged, with Ding Kang, Lianhe, and Dakang selling off, Lianyi, Dahua, Le Mao, and Hu Heji sold off after Category C bonds opened at 71.2 yuan, breaking through 71 yuan, then the 70 yuan mark, before stopping at 69 yuan. At that time, Tong Geng Kang massively absorbed, and Runli, Tongshun, Yizhong, Shengchang successively entered the market. Today, only morning trading will be done, and the market will close after delivery in the afternoon, reopening as usual on January 21st. However, at that time, interest will be deducted from the calculation. Yesterday, the total decline ranged from 2.05 yuan to 4.435 yuan, with a trading volume of over 5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock trading saw 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company stock traded at a price of 19.5 yuan.

The potential for various industrial stocks is good, and prices have also improved. The morning opening market was weak, but soon buyers were actively buying at low prices, and various stocks gradually trended upward. Market sentiment was particularly good at the close.

London, 21st (Monday) Telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat. Bank shares continued to be active, with the Mercantile Bank stock rising another 2 shillings 6 pence to 8 pounds 15 shillings. Chartered Bank stock rose 5 shillings to 11 pounds 2 shillings 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Awaits Spring, Fluctuations Narrowed

The yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, stabilized slightly yesterday. This was due to the stability of the foreign exchange rate, which brought a sense of calm to the market. However, the market was still dominated by long positions, so the market remained firm. However, actual transactions remained sluggish as usual. Some say this is due to the end of the lunar year. Future fluctuations will likely depend on the year-end, waiting for the spring to decide the outcome. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,420 yuan, and the low price was 1,404 yuan. Today, 190 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The morning opening for Double Horse yarn was extremely mild, with the initial price at 1,416 yuan. Later, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was stable, and long positions released their holdings, gradually falling to 1,406 yuan. However, as soon as the low price appeared, scalpers covered their positions, and new buying sentiment slightly flared up, returning to 1,420 yuan. However, the high price was actually reduced, and short positions became active, falling to 1,404 yuan again. Then, with the gold price rising again, it was pushed up to 1,415 yuan at the close. The half-day trading volume was 6,370 bales. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong: 220
Traders: 6,150

Total: 6,370

### Cotton Market Stalls

The current situation of the cotton market is trending towards stagnation. This is because faith in the legal currency is strengthening, leading to a gradual appreciation of the foreign exchange rate. As a result, market sentiment is flat, and transactions have almost disappeared.

Another report states that the New York cotton market initially fell due to southern gangs selling short, but soon rebounded due to favorable conditions for commodity trading and buying by the industry. As a result, closing prices were 3 to 6 points lower than the previous day. Indian cotton was flat, and yesterday, including forecasts, it was down a small half rupee.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading: yesterday, all parties were preparing to comfortably spend the year, and were indifferent to market conditions. Therefore, apart from pre-arranged banquets for the end of the year, nothing else was heard.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Bought on the Cheap, Absorption Again

The factory cloth market stabilized yesterday after falling. The morning opening was weak, and traders watched and waited. Guest brokers and long position holders released hoarded goods at a lower price, but the quantity was very small. The factories did not compromise, so actual users and traders absorbed the cloth cheaply, and the market stabilized again. Some plain white coarse and fine cloth fell by about 0.25 yuan per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth was flat. The total transaction volume on this street was over 300 bolts, with Zhejiang Road, Wenzhou, and Ningbo brokers buying 70 to 80 bolts of blue cloth and bleached cloth, and Fujian and Guangdong brokers buying 100+ bolts of pongee, colored cloth, and twill. 1,065 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 22nd and 710 pieces to Yantai.

The Eastern Cloth Market continued to soften. Plain white cloth and muslin fell by 0.25 to 0.50 yuan. Morning trading for Dragon Head fine cloth was 45.2 yuan, with the minimum price falling to 44.55 yuan. Later, due to a rebound in the tender amount, retail sentiment improved, and the price rose to over 5 yuan, with the closing price at 45.15 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Expensive Again

Yesterday, the sugar market slightly improved due to better market sentiment. The association quoted spot prices of 81.8 to 82 yuan for 24 raw white foreign warehouse sugar, up 0.3 yuan. The prices for delivery on February 10th were 82.2 to 82.4 yuan, unchanged. The price for delivery on February 20th was 82.6 yuan. The price for Dutch cotton white BS mark was 80 yuan, and Dutch red was 67 yuan, up 1 yuan.

### Grain: Hoarders of Foreign Rice Take Profits and Sell; Market Prices Drop by One or Two Yuan

Foreign rice inventories are substantial, with each warehouse having over 450,000 bags. Store inventories and local warehouses are not included in that total. There are also about 100,000 bags waiting to be unloaded in the harbor, and the number of goods en route expected to arrive during the Lunar New Year is also substantial. Overseas prices continue to be consistently high. Yesterday, foreign and Chinese merchants were still peddling, but guest hoarders and firms, who are keen on settlement of accounts, had no intention of placing further orders. Moreover, there was a flood of requests from English-Chinese brokers to sell on the market, as general long-position holders and those who had profited from hoarding hoped to sell in order to settle their accounts. Therefore, despite the insistence of big players on holding firm, spot goods ultimately saw a gradual decline. Although there were no transactions yesterday, market sentiment was very weak, and spot rice was reduced by at least one yuan across the board. High-end goods were reduced by one yuan or more within the limited price range. Only No. 1 Saigon cargo, apart from old goods which have a limited quantity, was still able to hold at the original level of 86 yuan or 85.7 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands went for 84.5 yuan to 83 yuan, No. 2 went for 80.05 yuan to 76.5 yuan. No. 1 old rice was also quite expensive at 85.5 yuan, while new rice was only 83 yuan, followed by 80 yuan. No. 2 was 75.5 yuan, flame-milled went for 82.5 yuan, followed by 81 yuan. The highest price for small-milled early rice was 74 yuan in the early morning, but it ultimately ended at 73 yuan. Premium Tokyo pointed cargo was rare and expensive, with bids being relatively fresh, fetching 74 yuan, 71 yuan. Mid-grade rice went for 68.5 yuan, 68 yuan, premium broken rice ranged from 66.5 yuan to 57.5 yuan for No. 3, 57 yuan. The small-milled Saigon futures were particularly oversupplied. The price for February small-milled futures opened at 81.5 yuan to 81.25 yuan, which is two yuan lower than the previous market's price of 83-84 yuan. Spot transactions for the entire day amounted to approximately 5,000 bags and futures totaled 400-500 tons. The rice market is only trading for one day today, which indicates a closing atmosphere.

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai in an unbroken stream, as has been repeatedly noted in these reports. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson’s Yusheng ship arrived from Hong Kong carrying 15,387 bags, which docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. There are also large quantities of Vietnamese rice loaded on French ships that will be shipped directly from Saigon this month. Large quantities of Burmese rice are also expected to arrive around next month. (Ancestor)

Thick rice from [unclear countries] is scarce and sales are sluggish. The market softened as owners are keenly seeking to sell off their rice. High-grade Changbang original white japonica was priced at 107.5 yuan, Kunshan original package white japonica was 105 yuan, 104 yuan for rice in vats, followed by 101 yuan, Qingjiao original package thin-hulled rice was 101 yuan, Qingjiao was 98.5 yuan and 97.5 yuan.

Glutinous rice trading remains brisk and the business of cake shops is also developing. The market is still able to hold and there's not much fluctuation. Li Yuan remains at 90 yuan, premium Hong Kong is 100 yuan, 78.4 yuan, followed by 75.5 yuan, 75 yuan, Special glutinous rice is 71.5 to 70 yuan.

### Flour Market Closes: Foreign Flour Inventory at 230,000 Bags

The flour market is showing signs of closing, as all parties are working to wind down ahead of the end of the year. Transactions at the Miscellaneous Grains Association market has already reached the last day. Therefore, spot flour sales are only being made by those on this street who urgently need to stock up, while all the speculation and trading has been settled. Those holding the goods also plan to wait and hold out for the reopening market next year before doing business again. The market remains solid. About 10,000 bags of Flower and Bird Brand flour were priced at 24.35 yuan, opening and rising to 24.6 yuan. The price of newly arrived Blue Mark Flower foreign flour from Hong Kong was 24.4 yuan. There's also a bid for newly arrived Soldier Ship Brand foreign flour which is priced at 24.3 yuan, but no deals have been made. Of the 10,000 bags of foreign flour transported by the Yuezhou ship, only 2,000 bags were Soldier Ship, the rest were Blue Mark Flower. This brand is well-received by local street dealers. More supplies are expected to arrive in batches. The Shanghai flour inventory, including all brands, is about 230,000 bags. The Miscellaneous Grains Association will close for the winter break from today and will resume operations on January 31st.

The wheat market has been quiet for a long time and winding down for the year is approaching. Domestic and foreign sources have been silent for a long time. Most of the inventory is being held and not being sold. Everyone is waiting to hold out for the reopening market after the Lunar New Year. The stocks of wheat at the concessions' warehouses and Wuxi and Changzhou are only about 2,000 bags. The wheat stocks held by the Japanese and Chinese factories are only sufficient for one month's use. Therefore, the future of the wheat market is expected to rise easily and difficult to fall.

### Miscellaneous: Live Pigs Flood the Market, Meat Prices Plunge

This year’s high meat prices are unusual. Because pigs come from the areas of Jiangbei, Qingshenggang, and Huanggang, they are affected by all sorts of factors. Heavy taxes and holding and manipulation have caused the public to eat "natural vegetarian meals" and avoid meat. Unexpectedly, recently the number of live pigs arriving has been very large. Firstly, pig farmers are eager to sell for cash to meet the demands of the new year, so they sell and transport their pigs to Shanghai. The price of fresh meat was highest during the Winter Solstice Festival, selling for 240 yuan per picul. Subsequently, due to poor sales, the price of went down to 200 yuan per picul. Currently, Shanghai has nearly 10,000 live pigs in stock. The current price of fresh meat has fallen to 160-170 yuan per picul, but retail meat prices in the shops are not willing to lower them due to the Lunar New Year.

### Sino-Western Charity Basketball Tournament Concludes: Huaxing Wins Third Game Against Mailing Last Night; 51 to 46, 18 to 18 at Halftime; Tense Situation, Huaxing Has Excellent Performance

The last game of the charity basketball tournament hosted by Huaxing Sports Association last night saw Huaxing defeat Mailing with an excellent performance, winning all three games. The final score was 51 to 46, with the halftime score tied at 18 to 18. Mailing played with an officer team last night, hoping to win the third game, but they still failed to achieve their goal. However, Henshawitz's individual technical performance was superb and admirable. Unfortunately, Henshawitz committed three fouls in the first half, and he did not dare to work too hard in the second half. This is also one of the reasons for the victory. Huaxing had excellent coordination last night, and their shooting was as smooth as if they were divinely assisted. Apart from Henshawitz, none of the other Mailing players performed well. In the women's performance before the game, Lanxing lost to Ailing Villa 25 to 17 because they were not used to the men's rules in the second half. Lanxing took the lead 13 to 8 in the first half, as they were using the women's rules. After the game, Ms. Jin Suqin, a famous actress, presented the awards.

Game Summary

After the tip-off, Xue Chong opened the scoring, and Huaxing took a 6 to 0 lead. Unexpectedly, Mailing scored 12 consecutive points, taking the lead instead. When the score was 15 to 11, Henshawitz committed his third foul. Huaxing gradually caught up, and Hongbin's long shot put them ahead 18 to 17. Mailing made a free throw, and the halftime score became 18. In the second half, Hongbin scored two, and Bao Songyuan and Li Zhenzhong scored consecutively, and from then on, they went smoothly, leading all the way. When the score was 41 to 34, Henshawitz showed his strength again, chasing the score to 41 to 40. However, Xue Chong and Hongbin scored again, and Mailing finally lost 51 to 46.

The Hua team has strong players such as Wang Lie and Li Zaichun. The battle was very exciting, especially the game between Ying Houjun, a young player of Jianmin team who is only one or two years old, and Li Feixiang, the main player of Hualian, which was very tense and won a lot of applause. As a result, the Jianmin team suffered its first defeat with a score of one to six due to slightly less experience.

### Haircuts and Baths

— Gao Yang

(I)

In the morning, as I picked up my bowl of porridge, my mother instructed me, "Sun, your hair is really too long. It looks like 'long hair,' which is quite unsightly. Go get it cut off today!"

"Oh, Mom, the school will be less crowded today. I'll go get it cut this afternoon!"

As I said this, I finished two bowls of porridge with a "slurp, slurp" sound, grabbed the newspaper, and left.

On the way, I passed by the "barbershop" entrance. The signboards were tightly closed, and there was a note posted outside, saying, "Our friends (the barbers) are demanding a raise and are suspending business for a few days, until,..."

However, another barbershop on the same street was already "open for business." A dark mass of long-haired friends were crowding inside.

Although I myself had "long hair," it was more important to get to school.

I busied myself all day, and at five-thirty, I hurried home again. A day's time had slipped away from my hands unnoticed. As soon as I got home, my mother urged me to get a haircut.

Actually, I found this "thing" to be quite a hassle. It meant wasting more than an hour sitting in a chair to enjoy it. However, if you added up the losses of thousands or tens of thousands of people, the time statistics would probably be an alarming number! But in order not to annoy others, I still had to groom myself a bit.

As soon as I entered the barbershop, it was filled with people.

"Sir, there will be space soon. Please sit and wait!" Then the apprentice offered me a cup of tea, a cigarette, and a hot towel. So I had no choice but to sit there and wait like a sick person. It wasn't polite to "leave."

When there was an opening, I filled it, and finally it was my turn.

"Sir, today is our first day back at work. Some bosses aren't willing to give us a raise, so they haven't started yet!" he said as he unbuttoned my collar and put on the white cloth.

"So, how much of a raise are you getting?" I asked casually.

"We work on a 'split account' basis. It used to be a '3-7 split,' but now it's changed to a '4-6 split.' It's really hard to make ends meet these days, sir!"

After going through the whole routine, an hour and a half had already passed.

"Sir, don't be polite!" the barber muttered in my ear as I opened my paper wallet.

I gave him fifty cents, and he said, "Sir, today it's seventy cents. Please take a look at that note!" He pointed to the glass window.

"Oh, so that's how they're raising their wages!" I realized to myself.

In the end, the power of "long hair" is great - the numbers added up on everyone's heads are alarming!

(II)

After the haircut, my parents told me to take a bath. "Ah, today is really a bad day!"

I grabbed my clothes and rushed to the bathhouse.

As I entered, it was a red "alley of flesh." The room was filled with steam, instantly obscuring the glass in front of my eyes.

"There are no empty seats. You'll have to sit and wait!" the attendant replied coldly. He probably didn't recognize me as a regular customer.

"Alright, I'll just have to wait today!" So I decided to settle down.

It was hard to wait until my turn. After taking a bath and coming out, I saw a dish of olives (commonly known as "yuanbao," which symbolize wealth) and a dish of peeled oranges on the table next to me. I was glad that they didn't give these things to me, or else my paper wallet would be embarrassed.

Other people were paying with five-dollar bills, but I only had fifty cents, so I wouldn't get any tea or towels.

On the way home, I thought of what the barber had said, "These are bad days, sir!"

### A Fighting Outlook on Life (40)

Hesitation leads to missed opportunities, hesitation breeds laziness. Hesitation is the poison of failure. A fighter gives serious consideration to final decisions, to avoid regret, but will never allow consideration to drag on, nor delay making decisions. Every decision is not the final one, and therefore should never remain stuck at the stage of consideration.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

"Don't rush, Mr. Yu... you're probably only forty-two years old this year, right? Thirty-one years ago, you were only about ten years old. How could you have changed someone's stage name?"

This question really stumped the Pingju master. A trace of red unusually appeared on his pale yellow face, which was usually full of smoke.

"Oh! I misremembered!" He tried hard to correct himself: "It was eleven years ago, not thirty-one years ago..."

Yuan Shaowen couldn't help but smile. But today he was the host, and the young man in the Western suit, Zhang Tianming, was his classmate. Of course, he was too embarrassed to continue putting Yu Zhongqian in an awkward position, so he immediately brought up another topic of conversation.

"Tianming, what do you think of how our third uncle is treating Yuqin now?"

"Not bad," the young man in the Western suit adjusted his scarlet tie and replied. "It doesn't seem as mushy as before! That's all thanks to your hard work from the sidelines."

"But three years ago, Liu Yuhua, a student in the Yuzhen class, also gave him a very powerful lesson!" Shaowen said with a smile.

"After Liu Yuhua was expelled from the Yuzhen class, I heard she's been performing in the South. I wonder if there's any news from Boss Qiu's side?" Yu Zhongqian interjected and asked.

Shaowen took out a stack of banknotes to settle the bill and answered very briefly:

"I haven't heard him mention it."

Just then, a bald head poked in through the curtain. As soon as they saw him, the three people in the room recognized him.

"Rongkui, are you here to urge your boss to go to the restaurant? He's already left with Yuan the Garrison Commander!" Zhang Tianming always rushed to speak first.

Rongkui was Qiu Haitang's attendant. He was indeed here to urge the performance. Hearing what Tianming said, he hurriedly said yes and was about to turn around and go back. (15)

### Tiger's Gall Gold Pearl (Continued)

— Xiu Bi

——Street Vignette

So, under the gaze of many people, he opened the package. He laid the package flat on the ground and then slowly opened it.

One by one, black, woody, hard things, like olives, were clearly seen by the audience.

"What is this?" the man asked the audience, pointing vigorously at the package on the ground: "Olives! Many friends will definitely answer that way. Don't we even know what olives are? Haha!"

But what are they really? An explanation is coming.

"Haha! If they were really olives, wouldn't I be crazy to bring them here? Can't you all just go to the fruit store to buy them? Let me tell you, this is not an olive, what is it?"

What is it? Here it comes again:

"It's a long story. Four years ago, I traveled to Tianmu Mountain and met an old monk. We talked about the scriptures and became very close. So the old monk took me to see a tree, a tree that grew so many of these things... and a ring."

Suddenly, he took out a wooden ring from his pocket.

"Was this made by a carpenter? Not at all! Hmph, this wooden ring is natural. It grows on the tree on Tianmu Mountain! At both ends of the ring, there are two of these things that look like olives. Look, everyone, there are still joints on the ring. If you don't believe me and say I'm 'talking nonsense,' feel free to go to Tianmu Mountain and ask the old monk."

Fortunately, Tianmu Mountain is very far away. The man continued to shout without blinking:

"What are these things called? They're called 'Tiger's Gall Gold Pearl'. As long as you hold one in your hand, poisonous snakes will turn away from afar. If you're bitten by a snake, you just need to apply this thing to the wound, and you'll recover immediately. As for the price, to be honest, my purpose is to help people, not to make money. If you have a lot of money in your pocket, be generous and give ten or eight yuan. I'll give you a few more. Poor friends, economical friends, if you don't have money, then two or three dimes will get you a few less... Everyone, it's all good karma that you met me today!"

The people around him listened to a long speech, and now they finally heard the result. Some started to walk away, while others took out money to buy the "Tiger's Gall Gold Pearl." A maid-like person gave him two dimes.

"Sister-in-law! If you have more money in your pocket, you might as well buy some more."

"I don't have any more. I'll just take a few for now."

A "knight" in black gave him a yuan. He waved the banknote in his hand and shouted: "You're a really generous friend. You must be making a fortune!"

One...

One...

Before long, the big bag of "Tiger's Gall Gold Pearls" was all sold out, and the people gradually dispersed, leaving only the man, some children, and the snake drawn with chalk on the sidewalk.

"Damn it, I'm going to die of joy! People in Shanghai are really easy to fool." The man carefully wrapped up the coins and banknotes and put them in his pocket. He also started to walk away, thinking this in his heart as he walked.

"In the whole world, which sly business doesn't rely on deception? And in Shanghai, it's especially true. Those big bosses, rich old men, handsome young men, and flirtatious girls, who isn't scheming and deceiving all day long?" These thoughts circled in his mind. Haha!"

Thinking this way, he felt very at ease and satisfied. His posture as he walked also seemed wobbly and completely happy.

And on that sidewalk, which was just very crowded, now only the snake drawn in chalk was facing the way, raising its head and wagging its tail, as if greeting the passersby. (The End)

### On Wu Tian's Adaptation of "The Family"

— Anyang

Wu Tian's adaptation of "The Family" can be said to be very faithful to Ba Jin's original work. Naturally, many trivial details are omitted. This is, after all, the difference between "dramatic" and "novelistic."

The tightly linked and circuitous development, evolution, and struggle within the crumbling feudal family, Wu Tian grasped the ideological consciousness without loosening. Therefore, it is easy to understand the theme, and at the same time, it is also helpful to highlight the typical characters. Because by reflecting the phenomena of their surrounding lives through the typical characters, we are already easily able to accept and understand the concepts contained in this life.

Drama is an art of creation. It does not mechanically explain the theme with formulas. It is gradually groped out. It goes through a complex and tortuous journey. This is the problem of adapting a script. Here, we have found that Wu Tian is able to extract gold from the trivial and complex sand.

The most excellent aspect of the technique is creating a strong tragic atmosphere, making it suffocating. Death is certainly the highest point of tragedy, but there must be entanglements before death. Just like Mingfeng's death, before her death, we found that she had gained a savior, which made us relax, thinking that she could be saved. But she told us that this savior was too late and useless. She still died. In this tense atmosphere, it seems to relax on the surface, but in fact, it stimulates the tense emotions and has a penetrating peak. This is just one example in "The Family."

The handling of typical characters is quite clever. Here, we see sympathetic characters, and we also see hateful characters. Moreover, we also see the author deepening, expanding, and endowing them with keenness and clarity, making those characters' personalities real and clear. Here, we find that the technique is to form it with "opposition." Wu Tian not only deliberately describes an image itself, but he can skillfully use opposite images to contrast it. He can also use the same image to set it off. There are people behind the bright characters, and there are people behind the dark characters. This tragedy is so fast, circuitous, and struggling.

The development of the whole play proceeds slowly from the first act, and the middle is circuitously moving forward until the end. The climax is appropriate, and it does not make people feel abrupt or dull.

I wish "The Family" a successful performance!

### Zhangtai Willow

— Gu Mingdao

She walked out into the courtyard in a simple white dress. When the crowd saw her coming, they shouted, "Madam Liu, how will you settle the debts that the minister owed?" Liu Rushi said to them very gently. "I acknowledge the debts that the minister owed you. These are the things that the minister did, and they have nothing to do with his children. With me here, please just give me some time, and I will definitely pay them off. Why do you have to shout and cause trouble, and bully orphans and widows?" On the one hand, everyone heard what she said, which was righteous and just. On the other hand, they had already agreed to return the debts, and the debts had an owner and would not be lost. The fierce flames were slightly restrained, and they all said that as long as Madam Liu could return the debts, that would be enough. However, half of the people still gathered in the doorway and refused to leave. Among them, there was a scoundrel named He Si, whose nickname was White Flower Snake. The people he gathered followed him and did not leave. They asked for wine and meat at the Qian family, sat down to eat, and asked for money while eating. When there was not enough food and drink, everyone went to the kitchen to take it themselves. They made even more noise when they drank, pretending to go crazy after getting drunk. The adopted son had no way to deal with them and still hid upstairs in the back, afraid to come downstairs. Liu Rushi said bitterly, "These people are really hateful. They clearly know that no one will stand up for the minister after his death and are just waiting for an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. If they really want money, why would they do this? The adopted son said, "He Si, the White Flower Snake, is a famous local ruffian here. People didn't pay attention to him before. Since the Qing soldiers came south, he has joined forces with a group of hooligans, shaved his head first, got to know a few Banner soldiers, and relied on their power to be tyrannical in this county, bullying good people and extorting money from others. His power is growing day by day. He seems to be among the gentry. They used him to intimidate our family in this debt collection matter, and he also wanted to take the opportunity to fish in troubled waters, so others left, but he still refuses to leave. How do we deal with him?"

Sayings on Self-Cultivation (18)

A boat sailing in the sea, the wind is strong and the waves are high, the danger is indeed dangerous, but it is not necessarily bad; unfortunately, being seized by a monster in the sea, with a bloody storm and fierce wind, the evil is indeed evil, but it is not necessarily desperate; unfortunately, if the change occurs within the elbow and armpit, and those in the same boat become enemies, then there is truly no hope!

### The Unrealism of Scenery: Film Studios Increasingly Turn to On-Location Filming; "Desire" Achieves Satisfactory Results

— Sima Hua

The major film companies in Hollywood all possess vast and fully equipped studios. When filming, no matter where in the world the story's background is drawn from, the results are always very satisfactory. This is naturally due to the exquisite scenery and appropriate research, but strong capital is the source of all power.

At that time, actors worked in the studios during the day, playing Arabian sheikhs, Alaskan trappers, red-coated Mounties, Western rogues, or cowboys, and in the evening, they could still go home to dine at their own tables and sleep soundly in their own beds. The film company authorities got what they needed, creating realistic films, and the actors also felt convenient.

Today, the above situation has changed considerably, because the hope for achievement in filmmaking has increased, and the scenery in the studios is no longer considered realistic enough, so they are increasingly turning to on-location shooting. Actors are taken to remote places, and they can no longer have the enjoyments of the past, but spend the night in tents, huts, or farmhouses. Here are many examples:

The RKO Pictures blockbuster "Desire," starring Charles Laughton and Carole Lombard, which was recently released, was led by director Garson Kanin, along with other actors, to Napa in the northern part of the state, thousands of miles away, to shoot exterior scenes of vineyards. They stayed in farmhouses and suffered a lot. The plot of "Desire" is a story of life and love that takes place in a vineyard in that area. Although there are also vineyards in Southern California, they are not the Napa vineyards needed in the plot!

MGM's blockbuster "Northwest Passage" was filmed in the mountainous countryside of Idaho in the West, because it is full of green forests, rushing rivers, and bottomless swamps—fully representing the landscape of the Saint Lawrence River region in the time of the ranger Rogers, although this era has become a thing of the past due to the progress of civilization. Spencer Tracy and his partners, when filming this film, were like an army camping in the wild.

Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea went to Montalvo Beach to film "Primrose Path." Now Paramount is preparing to go to Virginia in the East to film a film named "Virginia," just as Columbia went to Arizona to film a film named "Arizona." At the same time, the new Western star, Tim Holt, will star in two films in a row, and will film on location in the countryside of Utah in the West.

Hollywood used to film locally with scenery as the background, and although there were many blockbusters, they were not satisfied, and turned to more expensive on-location filming, entirely for the sake of seeking greater realism in the background. This great sacrifice for art—or, one might say, for business acumen—is worthy of praise.
